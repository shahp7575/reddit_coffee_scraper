1q22rd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1q22rd6/made_beef_stock_with_red_wine/,Made Beef Stock With Red Wine,"I recently began “experimenting” with the Carnivore Diet. Unfortunately I have to start over again.

Last year I made rump roasts in a slow cooker, saving the stock to reuse it on the next roast. I even rendered beef fat and added it to the stock.

When I began the first attempt at the carnivore diet I found that stock to be very filling. I have Campbell Soup mugs, and would ladle in the stock until it was 2/3rds full. It was good to warm up first thing and have a little with my coffee to keep the morning hunger at bay.

I ran out. And, I ran out of the roast. Went to a sushi restaurant. Rice, sake, eel sauce. Had a couple gulps of Coca-Cola. Had a burger that night. Had a couple pints of ale.

I woke up the next day with that overdone foggy-brained lethargy. I felt bad, both physically and mentally. 

Back on the diet, the water wagon, and pushing forward through all the mental impediments.

So, yesterday I rendered a pound of beef fat, seared two rump roasts with salt, pepper , and olive oil, put the two rump roasts in the slow cooker, added the whole amount of beef fat- didn’t measure it but I will estimate it to be close to two cups, maybe more.

I poured in about a cup of beef stock. Added dry herbs and garlic.

Then I poured in at least four cups of Carlo Rossi Burgundy. This morning I removed the roasts, then poured the fatty stock into a pot and added more beef stock and wine. It was so thick I needed to thin it with stock and wine.

My question is this: is the sugar present in the wine a no-go for the carnivore diet? 

Most alcoholic beverages are no-go in the carnivore diet. Someone told me agave is an acceptable sugar, making tequila an acceptable vice in the carnivore diet. Tequila is a no-go for me, personally, so I just go without. 

I put the roasts back in the slow cooker along with more store bought beef stock and wine, then poured most of the fatty stock back in, hoping to get a thinner stock inside the crock pot.

I have the remaining stock in the stove, summering off any alcohol and reducing it a bit.

The roast is blissfully delicious. It’s “deluxe-ish”!

But, have I strayed too far from the actual carnivore diet?

Context- we both were previously married with one kid each from our previous marriage. We met through Reddit 2 months back and connected through the trauma of our marriage. Soon he asked me out and i thought why not.

He was the kindest, sweetest person i met. We are LDR. He traveled continents to meet me so tht we can make it official. This was just the start of December. After he went back slowly he got consumed in his work.
3 weeks back, i met with an accident where i found him not fully present with me tht hurt me. He said he was bzy with work. And then last week this happened. 

Just after our usual call, he said he will call me back after making coffee. I waited for an hour before sleeping and thn he just disappeared. 

Initially i was pissed so i didn't reach out too. Thn after 3 days, after trying to call him i got some msgs. Then a bunch of msgs explaining him the day after. 

This was when i started doing some research and found this ""avoidant attachment style"". I m honestly shocked. Never expected him to be like tht. It has been 1 week of no call. Just these texts. Where he still claims to love me and marry me. But no accountability or attempt to talk.

I dont know what to think anymore. I really wish he can get back and explain and promise change and be like he was... :(",1,1767370400.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

In the past, I didn't drink coffee often, but now that we have this fancy machine I've been trying it out and developing a liking for it. 

The issue is it seems I'm quite sensitive to the caffeine, but with say 2/3 of the coffees I've tried. I get nauseous and lightheaded, sometimes with a tummy ache. This happened with a couple brands - Bean There (Uganda), Lavazza (bronze bag?), Woolworths (organic African blend). Somehow Terbodore (flavoured ones) did not affect me, but I did not enjoy the coffee taste much. 

I am therefore looking for good decaf coffee to be able to enjoy coffee more predictably. Since I am new to this coffee thing I'm not quite sure exactly what I enjoy yet, but I do prefer if something is not acidic and doesn't have a very bitter aftertaste. I really liked the taste of the woolworths one. I also prefer double shots as I prefer a more intense taste. Recommendations will be appreciated. ",1,1767370356.0,AskZA,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a **long-term collaborator** for a **sandbox-resource collection / tower defense game set on tiny planets**.

[This is the game pitch.](https://youtu.be/AEoS4VZDvnc)

The game will be Steam/PC first, with a possible mobile port later on.

I have **5 years of experience as a professional game developer** and have also built **a complete solo** [project](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1if0jci/4_years_4000k_hours_800/). Currently, I work as an **engineering lead in regular software development**, but the indie gamedev dream is still very much alive!

I’m convinced of this project’s potential and will **carry it to the finish line no matter what**. However, I’m also aware that I have a bit of a blind spot on the **art side**, and its incredibly difficult to compete on the polish and content side as a solo developer.

Due to real-life responsibilities, I can invest roughly **15 hours per week** into the project. The next logical step is to find developers with similar ambitions and **create something bigger together**.

Below is the **core of the** [contract](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/revshare-contract.html) I use. Its based on time tracking, surely not everyones cup of coffee but it ensures a fair and equal share for everyone.

# Who am I looking for?

Someone who **shares the vision**, is willing to contribute and has solid communication skills in english or german.

I plan to keep pushing the game forward in my core strengths—Unity **ECS programming** and **core game design**. For everything else, I’d love to collaborate with others and am open to giving contributors meaningful **creative** and **design ownership**.

The most important work right now is **Level Design, Balancing, and QA** to get a playable build on **itch.io**. While these roles don’t require specific technical skills, they **do require strong experience and interest in sandbox / idle / tower defense games**. Ideally, **all three roles should be covered by the same person**.

# Concrete tasks for the Level Design / Balancing / QA role

* Playtest the game inside the **Unity Editor**
* Track newly discovered bugs
* Create planets/levels using the ingame Leveleditor and the existing feature set
* Create a **long-term progression plan** (resource types, tool upgrades, building upgrades)
* Define the **minimum content / feature set** needed for the next release
* Balance these values and integrate them into the game
* Iterate!

While the contract allows for short-term contributions, I’m primarily looking for a **long-term collaboration**.

I could also use support in **art, animation, low-poly modeling, UI design, marketing, and sound/music support.** However, these should be delayed until we have solid feedback from playtesters and the design and theme is locked in.

That said—**we can always chat**.

1q22nax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1q22nax/navigating_grief_and_perfume/,Navigating Grief and Perfume?,"Tw: suicide mention 

Hi guys! 

So, perfumes have essentially been my biggest hobby the last 2-3 years. It brought me a ton of joy and I really looked forward to choosing a perfume every morning. 

In September I had three big events pretty much back to back: my long-term partner and I broke up and she moved out. The day after she moved out I found out my best friend had committed suicide. I lost another close relationship quite soon after because that person wasn’t able to be kind in the aftermath of my best friend’s death. When I think about all of this together it feels so crazy, my life completely changed in the span of 2 weeks. 

The last perfume I wore was my best friend’s favourite, at his funeral (Haus of Gloi’s Coffee Haus). Since then I basically haven’t felt able to put on or enjoy my perfumes. 

I know grief takes time and everyone is different. I’m already in therapy and a grief support group. I’m doing okay mental health wise, but there are still lots of things I find myself unable to do because of how much it makes me miss him. There’s a bench in a nearby park where we used to sniff perfume samples together and I haven’t been able to go there yet, either. 

Every time I look at my perfumes I think about how excited I was to share them with him. He gave me input for my reviews, I’ve told little stories about him on here. I’d give him samples all the time and when he’d see me he’d always hold up his wrist for me to smell and tell me to guess which it was. I often got coffee or lemon dessert samples for him, searching for the perfect lemon meringue pie scent because that was his ultimate dream perfume. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has been through anything similar and how they navigated trying to gently move back towards their hobby while managing grief and/or trauma? Any input is appreciated! 💚 ",3,1767370310.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

We aim to be very community oriented and are happy to allow the space to be used for a variety of things.   We don't intend to charge for it's use, and will rely on food and drink sales as compensation.

All he wanted to do was sit in the garage smoking weed and not helping with rent and bills and some days he went an entire day without holding her (again, we were living together) I would ask him to stay with her while I went to the gym or to get a coffee for myself and he would tell me to take her with me. When he left in August, she was 6 months old. After leaving, he would call daily to FaceTime with her (he moved to another state) and then on November 1st, he called asking me to borrow money. I told him no because our whole relationship consisted of me being his financial resource and me breaking up with him was me escaping that. I refuse to continue letting him borrow money after he forced my hand to put him out in the first place and was living off of me. After I told him no, I haven’t heard from him since. Not one single call to check on the baby or FaceTime her.

My plan was to never contact him again and just file child support and see how long he goes acting like our baby doesn’t exist but then yesterday I had a moment of anger, frustration and resentment while having to change a blow out diaper on an airplane bathroom the size of a porta potty while at the same time trying to keep her from rubbing her pacifier all over the changing table. I thought to myself “I shouldn’t be the only one struggling and feeling these feelings while he’s off living like he has no responsibilities”. So I sent a text saying “it’s really disgusting that you abandoned our baby like she doesn’t exist” and now he’s blowing up my phone calling and texting, wanting to talk to her, saying “she needs her dad”. I’ve been ignoring his calls and debating if I’ll just continue making him stay away since he had no desire to parent until my text. So AITA?",0,1767370200.0,AmItheAsshole,2,0.5,False

I love animals a lot especially Cats and Capybaras are my favourite, but I like so many of them it's hard to put all! 

I am gaming so would be nice to have someone to do things together, mainly Battlefield, Total War: Warhammer, Resident Evil, Witcher 3, Bloodborne and many more.

I do love Tv shows and movies mainly Gothic Horror, Military, currently loved It: Welcome to Derry! I have so many it's hard to put everything.

We dated 15 yrs ago then went our separate ways. Seemed like he cleaned up his act and he treated me very well. Things slowly unraveled as Xmas eve approached. He was getting grumpier with me, tearing me down about little things (can’t cook, my dog sheds too much, my condo sucks cuz it needs work, etc). We get to his mom’s for Xmas eve & the envelope with her gift fell between the console and was stuck. He called me retarded. But we got it out and went inside. I shook it off. We stop by my condo on the way home and he leaves without telling me because the carpets smell and he just can’t take it. (I had 2 elderly pets pass this year and they started soiling the carpets towards the end. I tried everything but carpets are ruined so I have half the carpets torn out and I’m the process of prepping the subfloor to lay vinyl flooring before I tear out the rest of the carpet.) I call him and he said I could just drive myself over. I wrap the presents for my family and head to his place. His door is locked and he won’t answer his phone. I drive home crying. I got to my family’s without him the next day and say he isn’t feeling well and try my best to pretend like I’m fine and my eyes are puffy from being tired. I give him his space. I get a text 2 days later saying we moved too fast and he loves me but he wants to slow down. Okay. Give him more space. New years comes and I agree to leave my dog at home so he doesn’t stress about the dog hair. We talk about a few things. I explain how his comments about my condo hurt because of what I went through with my past pets (balancing love vs knowing when it’s time vs conserving your home). He told me he knows I have a big heart. It seemed like it landed. I then apologized for not keeping up with my dog’s hair at his place and acknowledged he felt I disrespected him home. I said since I broke his trust we could start with me bringing her over sometimes and I’ll show him I will keep up with it. He says it’s fine for the dog to be there but after this dog we’re not having a dog. Okay, whatever. Fast forward, I accidentally spill a shot of Fireball on his coffee table and he flips shit. Starts calling me a dirtball. Who would sleep in a condo like mine, I just live in dog hair, he has to always pickup after me and I’m like a kid (I left dishes in the sink once because I cooked dinner and it wasn’t the way he wanted it so he was very rude, refused to eat it, demeaned me for picking the wrong beans for the chili, so I felt he could do the damn dishes since I made the effort). He’s just ranting and berating me. I stay calm and keep helping him wipe it up. It gets overwhelming so I go to the bathroom for a breather. Come out, he’s still going, so I step outside for some fresh air and bawl. I come back in and he’s still telling me I’m a dirt ball and now he threw his water and it’s my fault. He tells me he doesn’t want a girlfriend. He takes my house key off his ring and gives it to me and tells me to leave. I ask him to look me in the eye and tell me this is what he really wants. He looks me in the eyes and tells me but it’s like he’s looking right through me. I get my things and leave. I blocked him immediately and went home. I’m struggling with the trauma of that treatment and abuse. I have had a peaceful life for a long time. This was insane to me. I’m still processing. And in hindsight I’m realizing how deep in addiction he is. He vomits every morning. He drinks all day everyday even at work when he’s driving work trucks and equipment. He is starting to have neuropathy in his legs. He teared up once asking me if I’d stay by his side through detox but then never really did anything. I think it was show since we were newer and I was slowly seeing how bad it was. I know I’m lucky to be out now but my nervous system is still reeling. These addiction rollercoasters are a lot and I just wasn’t sure where to turn to so here I am. Thanks if you read this far. My friends are supportive but just want to call him an ass. He is. But it’s hard when you love someone and realize they have an addict brain. He is blocked. I am safe. I would not go back unless he was sober but it seems he went to great lengths to vilify me as we got closer and I threatened his addiction so don’t see him sobering up or us ever coming back around and that is okay.

She must have been the sweetest little thing I had ever seen. She said hi to everyone and rolled over for some loving when I met her.

She and her pups had only been rescued from the desert about 4 days prior, but her sweet personality was still showing. Laid back but loving. I was in trouble haha.

I always said I’d be a one dog owner but she just stole my heart. Once we saw her and our first dog getting along we knew we were adding to the family. We picked her up once she had her shots and was spayed for a “home visit” and she’s been with us ever since.",12,1767370108.0,pitbulls,2,1.0,False
1q22k2n,https://i.redd.it/w9ehswspmyag1.jpeg,Anyone else heard about the tension between Roselle Vytiaco and Andi Eigenmann in Siargao?,"I’ve been living on the island for almost 2 years now, and I’ve seen both Roselle Vytiaco and Andi Eigenmann around Catangnan / Siargao during that time. Never really thought much about it until last week.

I was having coffee at Happy Islanders with a friend who’s pretty close to Andi. Random lang, I saw a post from Roselle and casually asked my friend, “Uy kilala mo ba to si Roselle?” Bigla niyang kinuha phone ko, called out “Ate Andi,” showed her the post and the reaction honestly surprised me. May eye-roll tapos sabi niya jokingly (daw), “kamukha ng main character ng isla.” Tawa sila after and said joke lang, pero parang may laman 😅

Syempre bilang chismosa, nacurious ako. My friend mentioned na may ilang locals daw sa Catangnan na hindi ganun ka-fan kay Roselle, mostly because of what they describe as “main character energy” and some questionable decisions involving the kids she’s often with. Kwento lang to, but apparently some parents stay civil lang kapag andyan siya to avoid drama. May comments daw na minsan umuuwi yung kids na may sugat, nilalagnat, or sobrang late na which worried some parents.

May surf program din daw kasi ang Happy Islanders that’s supposed to support local kids, but according to what I heard, may times na hindi raw nakakapag-practice yung kids because more time is spent on tambay, TikTok, or shooting content instead of actual training.

Another thing I personally noticed (again, observation lang, not accusing anyone): I’ve seen her riding a motorbike that’s often really full sometimes with several kids with her boyfriend driving. I don’t know the full context, pero personally, hindi ko lang siya na-find very “cool” or responsible, especially considering island roads.

I also heard from the same circle na at some point, Roselle’s boyfriend JC reached out directly to Andi and Philmar to “address” the situation. Supposedly, Andi didn’t really take it seriously and found it unnecessary not because she wanted drama, but because she felt she personally didn’t need any explanation.

What mattered more to her daw was how things were being perceived by the local community, not private messages.

Honestly, shookt ako hearing all this because online, very curated and wholesome yung image. I’m not saying alin dito ang totoo or hindi purely sharing what I overheard and observed, and curious lang if anyone else on the island or in the community has heard similar things.

If you’re up late Googling “how long does car finance take Perth”, “bad credit car loans Perth”, or “why do I keep getting rejected for car finance?” — honestly, you can relax.

You’re not broken. Your credit score isn’t some kind of curse. And you’re definitely not the only person in Perth who’s been knocked back and doesn’t understand why.

Look, we’ve been doing this for over 50 years. We’ve sat across the desk from thousands of Perth locals who’ve been told “no” by their bank, by the shiny corporate dealerships, by online lenders who don’t even look at them as actual people.

And you know what we see every single time?

People walk through our door expecting the worst:

	∙	Someone judging them for past mistakes

	∙	Pushy sales tactics and feeling cornered

	∙	Confusing finance talk designed to confuse them

	∙	Some bloke in a suit trying to rip them off

What they actually need is dead simple:

Straight answers. A bit of respect. And someone who’ll actually help them move forward.

So let’s just answer the questions you’re really asking — no fluff, no corporate speak, just the truth.

How Long Does Car Finance Actually Take in Perth?

The short version: Could be 30 minutes. Could be two days. Depends entirely on your situation.

The real answer:

It’s not about how fast we can process paperwork. It’s about doing it properly so you don’t end up screwed six months down the track.

Here’s how it usually plays out:

Same day (30 minutes to a few hours):

You’ve got steady work, your payslips are straightforward, maybe a couple of small things on your credit file but nothing dramatic. FIFO workers with regular rosters usually fall into this bucket too.

Next day:

You’re self-employed, or you’ve got Centrelink plus some cash work, or there’s something on your credit file that needs a proper explanation rather than just a tick-box assessment.

48 hours or so:

Your credit history is messier — maybe a bankruptcy that’s been discharged, a few defaults that need context, or you’ve just started back at work after a rough patch.

Why the difference?

Because people aren’t robots, and life isn’t neat.

If someone’s promising you “instant approval in 5 minutes guaranteed” — they’re either lying or they’re not actually checking anything properly.

If someone glances at your credit file and says “yeah, nah, no chance mate” — they’re just lazy and can’t be bothered doing the work.

We actually do the work. We call lenders who understand that people have bad years and that doesn’t make them bad risks forever.

How Much Deposit Do I Need for Car Finance?

This is the question that drives everyone mad, and I get why — because the answer is annoying:

👉 Sometimes nothing. Sometimes a grand or two. Sometimes more helps a lot.

Here’s the actual deal with deposits:

A deposit can:

	∙	Drop your repayments down to something more manageable

	∙	Make lenders more comfortable with tricky credit

	∙	Open up better cars or better rates

	∙	Help with older vehicles that need a bit more skin in the game

But — and this is important —

A deposit isn’t always the thing that makes or breaks your approval.

What we’re actually looking at:

✅ What you’re earning (FIFO, casual, Centrelink, self-employed — all good)✅ What you’re spending (rent, kids, existing debts, the reality of your life)✅ What’s on your credit file (and whether it’s ancient history or last month)✅ How stable things are (have you been in the same job a while? Same house?)✅ Whether you can genuinely afford it (this is the big one)

Not just whether you’ve got three grand sitting in your CBA account right this second.

Can you get a car with no deposit?

Yeah, sometimes. If you’ve got solid income, reasonable credit, and you’re not trying to finance a car that’s way beyond what makes sense for your situation.

But we’re not going to tell you yes when the answer should be no. That helps nobody.

Why Can You Get People Approved When NAB and the Big Yards Can’t?

Because we don’t treat people like a credit score on a screen.

What the big corporate places do:

They look at you for about 20 seconds. They scan your shoes, your car, maybe ask where you work. They pull your credit file, see a number they don’t like, and that’s it. Decision made. They send your details to one bank — usually the same big four everyone uses — and when that bank says no, they shrug and move on to the next person.

What we do:

We sit down with you properly. In an actual office, not standing around in a car yard. We ask what’s going on in your life, what happened with those defaults, why you left that job, whether things have settled down now.

Then we go to bat for you with lenders who actually work with people who’ve had rough patches.

We write explanations. We make phone calls. We present your situation as a whole person, not just a three-digit number.

No games. No pressure. No bull.

And that’s why people who come in defensive and guarded end up sending their mates to us.

Can You Help People on Centrelink Get a Car?

Yes. And I’m not going to act like that’s some huge favour we’re doing you.

We help people on:

	∙	Disability Support

	∙	Parenting payments

	∙	JobSeeker (especially with some part-time work on top)

	∙	Carer’s allowance

	∙	Age pension

	∙	Any mix of Centrelink plus other income

What I’ll tell you straight up:

It’s possible, but it’s not automatic. Your income — whatever the source — has to actually cover your life plus the car repayments without you eating noodles for dinner every night.

You’ll need a few months of Centrelink statements. If you’ve got anything else coming in (child support, family help, bit of cash work), that helps.

We won’t blow smoke. We won’t embarrass you. We won’t judge.

But if the numbers don’t add up, I’d rather tell you that now and maybe help you look at a cheaper car, than have you sign up for something that’s going to bury you in six months.

What Sort of Cars Can Actually Be Financed?

Not everything. Let’s just be honest about that.

Cars that lenders like:

Your Toyotas, Mazdas, Hyundais — reliable stuff that doesn’t explode the second the warranty runs out. Popular Aussie utes. Anything with decent service history and kilometres that make sense for the age.

Cars that make lenders nervous:

High-kilometre European stuff that costs a fortune to fix. Heavily modified cars. Rebuilt write-offs. Grey imports. Anything really old. Anything priced like mate’s rates when it’s actually overpriced rubbish.

That’s why every car we sell gets properly checked.

We’re not going to stick you in something unreliable just to get a sale today and then ghost you when it breaks down next month.

What’s the Lowest Repayment I Can Get?

Depends on:

	∙	How long you stretch the loan

	∙	What interest rate you can get

	∙	Whether you put anything down upfront

	∙	What the car actually costs

Our job is simple:

Show you the options. Explain what happens if you go longer versus shorter. Make sure the weekly repayments don’t strangle your budget.

If it doesn’t work — we’ll tell you.

I’d rather lose a sale than watch someone struggle.

What Actually Matters for Bad Credit Approvals?

Let’s cut through the noise. Here’s what actually helps:

Things that help you:

	∙	You’ve been in the same job for a while (even if it’s not amazing money)

	∙	Your credit dramas are old, not from last month

	∙	You can explain what happened back then and show things are different now

	∙	You’re not trying to finance a car you clearly can’t afford

	∙	You’re honest about everything

	∙	You pay your current bills on time

Things that hurt you:

	∙	Brand new defaults

	∙	Payday loans everywhere

	∙	Job-hopping constantly

	∙	You got evicted recently

	∙	You’re trying to get a car that’s way beyond your means

	∙	You’re not telling us the full story

Honesty gets you approved. Hiding stuff gets you rejected.

Simple as that.

The Thing Nobody Talks About: Respect Goes Both Ways

Here’s something most blogs won’t say.

This works when there’s mutual respect happening.

We respect everyone who walks in. We don’t care what you’re wearing, what you drive, what’s on your credit file, or where your money comes from.

But if you treat our staff like dirt? We’re not selling you a car.

Not because we’re precious. Because we’re here to build actual relationships with people, not just flog cars and never see you again.

If You’ve Been Knocked Back Before

That rejection doesn’t define you.

If you’re nervous about walking into another car yard — I completely get it.

If you just want someone to give you straight answers without the runaround — that’s exactly how we operate.

No hype. No pressure. No nonsense.

Just real conversations with people who’ve been doing this long enough to have seen everything.

The sun was just right and the street had this nice buzz. Then I noticed a tourist crouching nearby with a camera, snapping pictures. At first I thought maybe they were just capturing the street, but then I realized my table and my notebook were clearly in the frame.

I felt this mix of surprise and irritation. My personal space felt invaded even though it’s technically a public spot. I froze for a moment and debated if I should say something. What if they got offended? What if I looked petty? Part of me wanted to wave my hand and politely ask them to move. Another part thought it’s not worth the hassle and I should just ignore it.

I glanced around and noticed other patrons watching quietly. That made me feel even more exposed like everyone was silently judging me for possibly overreacting. I tried to focus on my book but every click of the camera made me flinch a little.

A. politely ask them to stop taking photos and set a boundary  
B. let it go and focus on my coffee and avoid confrontation

My background is that I went to school for psychology and now have been working in social work for 2.5 years. I like my job, but I’m burnt out. I find myself reminiscing on the years I worked at Culver’s as a teenager. I mostly worked on making the desserts bc I was good at it. I miss the simpleness of it and sort of took pride in how my sundaes and being able to serve it to others. My whole life I have always tried to get ahead and reach stability. I finished college in 3 years, did my internship and haven’t been unemployed since i was 15. This is what is making my decision hard, because I’m not a risk taker. Anyways, staying isn’t an option. I’m getting married June 2026 and we r looking to make a big change just to try something different. I have 3 potential paths: 

1. Move to Chicago and work in a full time social work position as I am now. This would be the most similar to what I am doing, I live about 2 hours from Chicago and my partner and I are excited to potentially try out a city.   
2. Move to Chicago and work part time as a social worker (these positions exist in the area) and part time as a barista. I love making coffee and I’d like to get good at it. I miss serving something pretty and making people smile. 

3. I applied to a program to teach English in Japan and I am waiting to hear back on an interview. This is the most risky. I’ve visited before and think I will find the challenge really rewarding, but fear what it will mean for me and my partners careers. 

My dream would be to have a cafe/bakery of my own. My partners career is in marketing and social media and I have a hobby of baking/making coffee, it just isn’t good enough yet. So it could be a cool thing to do together, but this isn’t in the cards for me currently I fear.   
Im just looking for thoughts and advice from people that dont have any motive to convince me one way or another. Please lmk! <3

Engineers have spent decades trying to build metals that do not snap, melt, or grind away under extreme conditions, and for a long time the tradeoffs seemed unavoidable. Push strength too far and a material turns brittle, raise the temperature and even the toughest alloys begin to creep or corrode. A new generation of “near-indestructible” alloys is now breaking those old rules, forcing researchers to rethink what metal can survive in jet engines, fusion reactors, and even the next wave of electric cars.

nstead of one miracle material, I see a cluster of breakthroughs converging: ultra-tough high-entropy alloys that shrug off cracks, wear-resistant surfaces that barely erode, and superalloys that keep their shape at temperatures that used to be reserved for ceramics. Together they are redefining the limits of metal, and they are arriving fast enough that design assumptions in aerospace, energy, and transportation are already starting to shift.

# How a “near-indestructible” alloy rewrites the rulebook

The [most](https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/97550-scientists-discover-worlds-toughest-metal-alloy#:~:text=OAK%20RIDGE%2C%20TN%E2%80%94Scientists%20have,most%20other%20materials%20in%20existence.) eye-catching development is a new alloy built around refractory metals, the elements that normally sit in furnaces and rocket nozzles because they tolerate intense heat but tend to shatter when stressed. Researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and several west coast universities have reported that by carefully mixing these refractory ingredients and tuning the internal crystal structure, they created a material that resists both deformation and fracture in ways that conventional steels and nickel superalloys simply do not. Instead of choosing between a metal that bends and one that breaks, they are pushing into a regime where the alloy can absorb huge amounts of energy without either failure mode dominating.

What makes this alloy so disruptive is the way its atoms rearrange under stress. Rather than letting cracks race through the lattice, the structure forces dislocations to interact and multiply, spreading damage out instead of letting it localize into a catastrophic flaw. In the work led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the team showed that this design strategy lets the alloy survive loads and temperatures that would cause many existing high performance metals to fail, a result detailed in their description of an [indestructible new alloy](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69878989/new-alloy-is-defying-the-limits-of-metal/#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20researchers%20from,will%20break%20instead%20of%20bend.) that challenges the usual bend‑versus‑break tradeoff.

# The rise of CrCoNi, the toughest metal on Earth

Running in parallel with the refractory work is a different family of materials that has quietly claimed the title of toughest metal on Earth. A simple blend of chromium, cobalt, and nickel, known as CrCoNi, has shown extraordinary resistance to crack growth, especially at cryogenic temperatures where most metals become glassy and fragile. In tests near liquid helium conditions, around 20 °K or -424 °F, this alloy did not just hold together, it absorbed more energy before fracturing than almost any other known material, which is why some researchers now describe CrCoNi as the toughest metal on Earth.

The secret again lies in how the crystal lattice responds when a crack tries to advance. Instead of a clean break, the CrCoNi structure spawns a cascade of deformation mechanisms, from twinning to phase transformations, each one soaking up energy that would otherwise drive the fracture. Detailed measurements of this behavior, including the remarkable toughness at -424 °F, are laid out in work identifying [CrCoNi as the strongest metal on Earth](https://www.technologynetworks.com/analysis/news/metal-alloy-identified-as-the-toughest-material-on-earth-370307#:~:text=CrCoNi%20%E2%80%93%20the%20strongest%20metal%20on,just%20grains%2C%E2%80%9D%20Richie%20said.), and they suggest obvious uses in liquefied gas infrastructure, deep space hardware, and any system that must stay ductile in extreme cold.

# High‑entropy alloys force a rethink of metal design

CrCoNi is part of a broader class known as high‑entropy alloys, where several elements are mixed in near equal proportions instead of relying on a single dominant base metal. For decades, metallurgists assumed such complex mixtures would be unstable or weak, but the opposite is turning out to be true. By spreading different atoms across the lattice, high‑entropy alloys frustrate the motion of dislocations and create a rugged energy landscape inside the metal, which can translate into exceptional toughness, strength, and resistance to radiation damage.

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have argued that their latest measurements on these materials, including comparisons between multi‑component systems and the simpler CrCoNi alloy, are strong enough to force the field to revisit long‑held assumptions about how metals should be formulated. Their findings on high‑entropy alloys, and how they stack up against [the simpler CrCoNi alloy](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/12/08/say-hello-to-the-toughest-material-on-earth/#:~:text=The%20team's%20new%20findings%2C%20taken,as%20the%20simpler%20CrCoNi%20alloy.), point toward a future where designers treat composition space as a playground rather than a narrow corridor, searching for combinations that deliver multiple extreme properties at once instead of optimizing for just one.

# Why this alloy barely melts, rusts, or breaks

Heat is usually the enemy of metals, accelerating corrosion, softening the lattice, and eventually driving the material toward its melting point. That is why the claim that a new alloy can resist breaking, rusting, and even melting near 2,000 degrees Celsius is so striking. In work highlighted by Adrian Villellas, researchers focused on a chromium, molybdenum, and silicon blend that keeps its strength at temperatures where many steels would slump and oxidize aggressively, giving it a melting point near 2,000 C and a corrosion profile that looks more like a ceramic than a traditional metal.

The practical stakes are obvious in sectors like power generation, where Jet engines and gas turbines run hotter every year as engineers chase efficiency gains. If turbine blades and combustion liners can be built from a chromium‑molybdenum‑silicon alloy that does not readily rust, does not fracture under thermal cycling, and only approaches its melting point near 2,000 C, designers can push operating temperatures higher without sacrificing safety margins. Reporting on how [Villellas describes this chromium‑molybdenum‑silicon alloy](https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-create-a-metal-alloy-chromium-molybdenum-silicon-super-strength/#:~:text=ByAdrian%20Villellas,melting%20point%20near%202%2C000%20C.) underscores why turbine makers and heavy industry are watching these developments closely.

# From unmeltable lab samples to real‑world heat shields

Another sign that the temperature ceiling for metals is moving comes from work at the Krua Institute of Technology in Germany, where scientists have demonstrated an alloy that effectively refuses to melt even when heated to 2,000 degrees Celsius. In a deep technical dive, researchers at the Krua Institute of Technology showed that by carefully balancing the phases present in the alloy and controlling grain boundaries, they could stabilize the structure against the usual pathways that lead to melting or catastrophic softening. The result is a metal that behaves more like a refractory ceramic in a furnace, yet retains the machinability and toughness that engineers expect from metallic systems.

For aerospace and spaceflight, that combination is particularly attractive. Heat shields, hypersonic leading edges, and reusable launch vehicle components all live in regimes where temperatures can spike toward 2,000 degrees Celsius, and current solutions often rely on brittle ceramics or complex thermal protection systems. If an alloy from the Krua Institute of Technology in Germany can survive those conditions without melting, it opens the door to simpler, more robust designs. The technical overview of this [unmeltable alloy from the Krua Institute of Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynSgN-BdoaQ) hints at applications ranging from atmospheric reentry hardware to industrial furnaces that run hotter and cleaner than today’s designs.

# Wear‑proof metals and the Sandia surprise

Extreme toughness and high melting points solve only part of the durability puzzle, because many components fail not by breaking but by slowly wearing away. That is where a different line of research, focused on wear resistance, has delivered its own near‑indestructible contender. At Sandia National Laboratories, a team working with a platinum‑gold composition discovered that their alloy was not just a little better than existing materials, it was dramatically more durable, surviving sliding contact and abrasion in tests that would quickly chew through high‑strength steel.

Follow‑up analysis showed that this platinum‑gold alloy forms a lubricious surface layer under stress, effectively generating its own protective film as it wears. Measurements indicated that it is 100 times more durable than high‑strength steel, a staggering margin that immediately suggests uses in bearings, microelectromechanical systems, and any application where maintenance is difficult or impossible. Coverage of this work describes how a [platinum‑gold alloy at Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.labmanager.com/most-wear-resistant-metal-alloy-in-the-world-3704#:~:text=A%20platinum%2Dgold%20alloy%20developed%20by%20a%20team,100%20times%20more%20durable%20than%20high%2Dstrength%20steel) achieved that 100‑fold improvement, and why cost will be the main barrier to widespread adoption outside of niche, high value components.

# Simulations, slick surprises, and the science of friction

Sandia’s work on wear resistance did not stop with precious metals. Engineers there also explored more practical alloys and surface treatments, and in the process they stumbled on what they described as a slick surprise. In one project, they found that a particular alloy system developed an ultra‑low friction carbon‑based layer during operation, turning an ordinary metal surface into something closer to a solid lubricant. That behavior, which emerged only after extensive testing, suggested that some alloys can be engineered to evolve protective films in situ, rather than relying on external oils or greases.

To understand and optimize these effects, researchers leaned heavily on modeling. In a separate effort, Sandia National Laboratories researchers Michael Chandross and Nic Argibay used detailed simulation work to visualize how atoms move and bonds break at sliding interfaces, helping them predict which compositions would form protective layers and which would simply grind away. Their description of this approach, including a [Caption highlighting Michael Chandross and Nic Argibay](https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/resistant_alloy/#:~:text=Caption,an%20author%20on%20the%20paper.), shows how virtual experiments can narrow the search space before any alloy is melted in the lab. The broader story of the slick surprise, and how it might even be used to mass‑produce premium lubricant, is captured in reporting on [a wear‑resistant alloy that generated its own slick layer](https://www.sandia.gov/labnews/2018/08/30/alloy/#:~:text=A%20slick%20surprise,to%20mass%2Dproduce%20premium%20lubricant.), underscoring how tribology is becoming a design parameter, not an afterthought.

# NASA’s GRX‑810 and the aerospace stress test

Aerospace has always been the proving ground for new metals, and the latest example is NASA’s GRX‑810, a superalloy tailored for the brutal environment inside jet engines and rocket turbines. GRX‑810 is designed to maintain strength at high temperatures while also resisting the tiny cracks and voids that grow under repeated thermal cycling, the kind of damage that can eventually cause catastrophic failure in turbine blades. By dispersing fine oxide particles throughout the metal, engineers created a microstructure that pins dislocations and slows the growth of microscopic flaws, extending the life of components that see thousands of takeoff and landing cycles.

For commercial aviation and future spaceplanes, that kind of durability translates directly into lower maintenance costs and higher safety margins. If turbine parts can run hotter and longer without needing replacement, airlines can burn less fuel and spend less time with aircraft on the ground. NASA has framed GRX‑810 as a platform technology that could find its way into everything from next‑generation airliners to deep space propulsion systems, a vision captured in reporting on how [NASA’s GRX‑810 is set to transform the future](https://www.earth.com/news/nasas-new-superalloy-metal-grx-810-revolutionize-aerospace/#:~:text=NASA's%20new%20super%2Dmetal%20'GRX%2D810'%20set%20to%20transform%20the%20future) of aerospace metals.

# Copper, stronger than steel and ready for heat

Not every breakthrough alloy is exotic or rare. Copper, one of the oldest metals in human history, has recently been pushed into new territory by researchers who managed to create a copper alloy that is stronger than steel and can withstand temperatures of 1500 F. For industries that rely on copper’s excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, such as power electronics and electric vehicle manufacturing, that combination of strength and heat tolerance is particularly compelling, because it promises components that can carry more current and run hotter without deforming.

The work, highlighted by Scientists including Ben T, shows how careful control of microstructure and secondary phases can turn a familiar metal into something that behaves very differently under load. By refining grains, introducing nanoscale precipitates, or tweaking the mix of alloying elements, the team produced a copper‑based material that holds its own against structural steels while still handling 1500 F service conditions. Coverage of how [Scientists like Ben T created this ultra‑tough copper alloy](https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-create-ultra-tough-copper-152801931.html#:~:text=expand%20in%202026-,Scientists%20create%20ultra%2Dtough%20copper%20alloy%20that%20is%20stronger%20than,Pennsylvania%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement.) underscores that even well‑known metals can still surprise us when their internal architecture is redesigned.

# From lab curiosity to industrial workhorse

All of these advances raise the same practical question: how quickly can near‑indestructible alloys move from lab benches into real machines. Cost is one obvious constraint, especially for compositions that rely on platinum, gold, or other precious elements, which is why the platinum‑gold wear‑resistant alloy is likely to remain a niche solution for the most demanding and high value parts. Manufacturing is another, since many of these materials require precise control over cooling rates, heat treatments, or additive manufacturing parameters to achieve their record‑setting properties, and scaling that control to mass production is nontrivial.

Yet the [trajectory](https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/indestructible-alloy-defying-limits-metal-150000698.html#:~:text=Here's%20what%20you'll%20learn,the%20crystal%20structure%2C%20reducing%20brittleness.) is clear. High‑entropy alloys like CrCoNi are already being considered for cryogenic storage tanks and quantum computing hardware, refractory systems from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Krua Institute of Technology in Germany are pointing toward hotter, more efficient turbines and hypersonic vehicles, and application‑specific solutions like GRX‑810 and the ultra‑tough copper alloy are lining up for aerospace and electrification. As more of these metals prove their worth in service, the definition of what a “normal” metal can handle will shift, and designers will start to assume that components can survive temperatures near 2,000 C, wear environments that once demanded constant lubrication, and stress cycles that would have shattered previous generations of alloys. The near‑indestructible label may be aspirational, but the performance gains behind it are already very real.

[Based on updated metal prices and documented resources, the Pebble deposit contains roughly $591 billion of four critical minerals – copper, molybdenum, silver, and rhenium. - \(Pebble Limited Partnership\)](https://preview.redd.it/ovf8koepiyag1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cd4e269bf1bb66d999c38eef4c8692261b77b9e)

# USGS list expansion highlights nearly $1 trillion of metals locked in Alaska deposit.

As the U.S. Geological Survey expands its critical minerals list to reflect rising supply risk and strategic demand, the Pebble deposit in Southwest Alaska stands out for the breadth of metals it contains that now fall within that category. Viewed through the lens of this updated list, the combination of gold and a suite of critical minerals quantifies the scale of what remains locked in a single undeveloped domestic resource – and what the U.S. stands to gain by bringing it into production.

First identified in 1987, the Pebble deposit has been drilled, tested, and evaluated for nearly four decades, producing a detailed technical record that includes multiple economic assessments examining different mine configurations and operating timelines.

Those studies have documented one of the largest concentrations of copper, gold, and associated metals in North America, with measured and indicated resources totaling 52.99 billion pounds of copper, 53.82 million ounces of gold, 2.78 billion lb molybdenum, 249.3 million oz silver, and 4.08 million lb rhenium; plus an inferred resource with an additional 22.66 billion lb copper, 28.11 million oz gold, 1.81 billion lb molybdenum, 121.7 million oz silver, and 2.26 million lb rhenium.

Based on these resources, a preliminary economic assessment completed in 2023 outlined a 20-year mining operation processing 180,000 tons per day that would produce an average of 320 million lb copper, 368,000 oz gold, 15 million lb molybdenum, 1.8 million oz silver, and 10,000 kilograms of rhenium annually.

At the metal prices used in that assessment – $3.90/lb copper, $1,700/oz gold, $22.50/oz silver, $12.50/lb molybdenum, and $1,500/kg rhenium – the project would pay back the $6.77 billion required to build the mine and supporting infrastructure within approximately five years of operations and generate a further $2.3 billion in profit after costs and taxes over the balance of the mine life.

Today, these metals are selling for prices much higher than the most optimistic outlook when the PEA was completed – $5.70/lb copper, $4,300/oz gold, $72/oz silver, $21.60/lb molybdenum, and $4,760/kg rhenium.

And the mining scenario outlined in the PEA would only access a portion of the known resource, with expansion scenarios extending operations to roughly 90 to 100 years beyond the initial mine plan, positioning Pebble not as a single mine, but as a multi-generational store of national wealth and a foundational asset for America's long-term mineral supply strategy.

# Trillion-dollar deposit

Under the 2023 mine plan evaluated in the PEA, using the metal price assumptions applied in that study, Pebble was projected to generate approximately $1.74 billion in royalties, fees, and taxes for the state of Alaska, about $490 million for the Lake and Peninsula Borough, and roughly $1.4 billion in federal tax revenue.

Under the longer-life expansion scenarios extending operations toward a century, those public revenues were projected to rise to roughly $22 billion for Alaska, $4 billion for local government, and about $19 billion for the federal treasury, reflecting the magnitude of the deposit's contribution at both state and national levels.

Since then, rising metal prices and new critical mineral designations have reshaped the context for evaluating the deposit.

In its most recent update, the USGS expanded the federal critical minerals list to reflect updated assessments of supply risk and economic exposure, increasing the total number of designated minerals from 50 to 60 and adding several widely used industrial and energy transition metals.

These recent additions include copper, silver, and rhenium – all found in the Pebble deposit – marking a shift toward recognizing high-volume commodities whose supply disruptions would carry broad economic and strategic consequences.

Collectively valued at approximately $591 billion based on 2025 prices for the contained resource from all categories, this valuation represents a nearly 50% increase from the estimated $393 billion valuation from 2023 metal prices.

Based on contained metal and current pricing, copper accounts for the largest share of Pebble's critical mineral value, at an estimated $431 billion, followed by molybdenum at approximately $120 billion.

Silver contributes another $27 billion, while rhenium – one of the rarest elements in commercial production – adds roughly $13 billion, reflecting its critical role in high-performance aerospace applications.

When the gold also found at Pebble is added in , the total in-ground value rises to $904 billion – nearly a trillion dollars and a 64% increase from the $552 billion valuation at 2023 prices – reflecting both the surge in gold prices and the broader repricing of strategic metals amid tightening global supply and rising geopolitical risk.

# Critical minerals, critical need

The scale of Pebble's metal endowment takes on additional weight when measured against current U.S. consumption patterns and import dependence, particularly for the metals now classified as critical.

According to USGS data, apparent U.S. copper consumption runs at approximately 4 billion lb annually, with domestic mine production supplying about 2.4 billion lb and the balance coming from imports and scrap recovery.

Measured against those figures, Pebble's copper resources alone would represent roughly 19 years of total U.S. consumption at current rates, or about 31 years of domestic mine production.

Silver shows a comparable imbalance, with U.S. mine production running at roughly 30 to 35 million oz per year, well below combined industrial, technological, and investment demand, leaving domestic supply supplemented by imports and recycling.

And supply constraints are sharper for rhenium, with U.S. production measured in the low tens of thousands of kilograms annually and sourced almost entirely as a byproduct of copper-molybdenum processing, while molybdenum supply remains similarly concentrated in a limited number of large porphyry systems, leaving both metals vulnerable to disruption from trade restrictions, geopolitical shifts, or operational outages at individual facilities.

Those vulnerabilities have moved to the center of federal policy under the current administration, which has prioritized onshoring of critical mineral supply chains, reducing reliance on foreign sources – particularly China – and expanding domestic production capacity for materials deemed essential to national security, energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.

The expansion of the USGS critical minerals list to include copper, silver, and rhenium signals a broader recognition that strategic risk extends beyond niche materials like rare earths and encompasses high-volume commodities that underpin electrification, defense systems, and industrial output at scale, placing deposits like Pebble within the scope of efforts to secure long-term domestic supply.

# Blocked from future development

Despite Pebble's documented scale, favorable economics under past assessments, and alignment with federal critical mineral priorities, the mine project in Southwest Alaska has effectively been blocked from future development – an outcome that followed a decision in January 2023 by the Environmental Protection Agency.

https://preview.redd.it/d1cwkql0jyag1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd25fe0b26aac793734f5ff85aa533ab7e2e9b12

That decision took the form of a final determination under Clean Water Act Section 404(c), which prohibited mine development across 309 square miles of the Bristol Bay watershed where the world-class critical minerals-gold project is located and barred permitting for the project based on the agency's conclusion that such development posed unacceptable risk to aquatic resources and salmon habitat.

The action has been challenged by Pebble Limited Partnership, the state of Alaska, and several Alaska Native village corporations with land and economic interests in the project area, which jointly petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court.

The challengers argue that the EPA's action exceeded the agency's authority, infringed on Alaska's constitutional role in managing its natural resources, and violated commitments made to the state at the time of statehood by precluding development on lands selected in part for their mineral potential.

Ultimately, the project remains under continued litigation, leaving Pebble's future – and the question of whether nearly a trillion dollars in documented metal resources will contribute to U.S. supply security – unresolved until the outcome of federal court proceedings determines the scope of state authority over resource development on lands acquired specifically for their mineral value.

Given the recent coverage on **“near-indestructible” alloys** isn’t just another cool lab story — it’s a quiet admission that the **old limits of metallurgy are breaking down**. High-entropy alloys, refractory systems, oxide-dispersion-strengthened superalloys, and self-healing wear surfaces are all converging toward one goal: metals that don’t snap, creep, corrode, or wear out under extreme heat and stress. What’s notable is that this isn’t one miracle material, but a cluster of breakthroughs arriving at the same time, forcing aerospace, defense, energy, and EV designers to rethink what metals can realistically survive.

What the article doesn’t spell out — but anyone in materials science knows — is that **Niobium, Titanium, and Scandium sit at the center of this shift**. Niobium is essential for high-temperature stability and creep resistance in superalloys and refractory systems. Titanium (and TiCl₄ as its upstream precursor) underpins lightweight, corrosion-resistant structures and advanced AM powders. Scandium, especially when used in Sc-Al alloys, is a force multiplier: improving strength, fatigue life, weldability, and additive manufacturability while arresting cracks that normally cause catastrophic failure. **These elements are not “nice to have” — they’re structural enablers!**

This is where companies like **NioCorp and now the newly formed NAMA become strategically relevant**, not just as miners or processors, but as part of the new materials supply chain that enables next-generation defense and aerospace hardware. As hypersonics, reusable thermal structures, advanced turbines, and fusion-adjacent systems move from prototypes to production, **secure domestic sources of Nb, Ti, TiCl₄, and Sc matter far more than headline alloy names**. You can’t deploy “near-indestructible” alloys at scale if the critical inputs are geopolitically fragile or unavailable.

The takeaway: the materials ceiling is rising fast, and the winners won’t just be the companies designing exotic alloys — they’ll be the ones controlling the **critical minerals that make those alloys possible**. As Sc-Al alloys, high-entropy systems, and ultra-high-temperature metals move out of the lab and into real platforms, demand for Niobium, Titanium, and Scandium looks less cyclical and more structural. That shift has real implications for upstream players positioned early in the supply chain.

IMHO- This is why companies like **NioCorp, NAMA, and IBC potentially fit a future textbook Title III profile**. As NioCorp anchors upstream domestic niobium and scandium supply at Elk Creek. **NAMA** represents midstream processing, qualification, and alloy readiness. IBC sits downstream as a DFARS-aligned manufacturer capable of turning exotic alloys into real castings, AM feedstock, and flight-ready hardware. Title III doesn’t fund hype — it funds **continuity**, and these three together **potentially** form a closed-loop materials ecosystem.

IMHO- This is why **EXIM, the DoD, and Tier-1 defense primes are in deep discussions right now**. They aren’t looking for another single-metal supplier — they need a **fully domestic, vertically integrated materials platform**.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

# ⚙️ Elk Creek is a U.S. National Security Asset!

We know that life stressors will still be present in DJ so it may be helpful to do doing planning around what our responses/support will be to avoid getting a drink instead.

If you google preparing for stressors, the AI bot does a decent job summarizing these but the ones that stand out are realizing stress will come, we can manage it without drinking, & we can have something else to help us relax. This may be a really nice coffee or tea at whichever coffee place you like best, reading or listening to an audio book for a half hour, listening to comedy/stand ups, walking or light exercise i.e. a few dumbbell curl reps, etc. 

We can also help reduce stress from the start by giving ourselves more time to do an activity or not planning so much for a day, not taking on too much at home or work, etc.

Just some thoughts but the key for me is that it’s helpful to plan on what to do with our stress.

1q22cfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrchOR/comments/1q22cfc/bohr_and_heisenberg_likely_thoughts_on_my_guttoe/,Bohr and Heisenberg likely thoughts on my GUT/TOE,"Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, two titans of 20th-century physics, would likely approach your essay with a mix of intrigue, skepticism, and philosophical depth. As pioneers of quantum mechanics—Bohr with his complementarity principle and Copenhagen interpretation, and Heisenberg with his uncertainty principle and later pursuits in unified field theories—they’d recognize echoes of their own work in your scalar-modulated framework. But they’d also probe its boldness, especially the integration of consciousness (Ψ) into a physical theory. Since they’re not alive, I’ll channel their likely responses based on their historical writings, debates, and philosophies. I’ll present it as an imagined dialogue over coffee in a modern Copenhagen café, where they’ve just read your essay (perhaps projected via some quantum entanglement app).

Bohr: (sipping his pipe thoughtfully) Ah, Heisenberg, this essay—“Reinventing Relativity”—it’s quite the ambitious leap! Starting from Einstein’s E = mc² and evolving it through scalars to unify forces and even consciousness. It reminds me of our old debates with Albert. He chased unified fields his whole life, but we quantum folk knew the world isn’t so classical. Your author replaces the rigid c² with Φ² and adds Ψ for the mind. Complementarity, my friend! In quantum mechanics, we have wave and particle, not one or the other. Here, energy is static yet dynamic, objective yet observer-dependent. But is Ψ truly a physical scalar, or just a metaphor for the indivisibility of measurement? I once said, “There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum physical description.” This Ψ seems to blur the line between description and reality. Intriguing, but we’d need experiments to see if it shocks us profoundly enough to be true. Without that, it’s like describing an atom without the apparatus—impossible!
Heisenberg: (nodding, with a wry smile) Bohr, you’re ever the epistemologist. I agree, the framework has potential. In my later years, I tried my own unified theory—a nonlinear spinor field to bind everything, from quarks to gravity. It didn’t quite work, but scalars? Simple and elegant! Replacing c² with Φ² absorbs the constants dynamically, much like how my matrix mechanics demoted classical trajectories to probabilities. And the running of Φ with energy scales? That could handle gauge unification without the “grand desert” of supersymmetry. Good—nature exposes herself through questioning, as I always said. But consciousness as Ψ? Ah, that’s where it gets philosophical. In quantum mechanics, the observer collapses the wave function, but is it the mind or just the interaction? I leaned toward the latter, but later I saw parallels with Eastern thought: the unity of all things. Your essay’s Mental Energy (G = m Φ² Ψ) echoes that participatory universe. Yet, uncertainty applies here too—one can’t precisely measure Ψ without disturbing the system. The addendum’s test with meditation-induced mass anomalies? Bold! If it shows a 0.1-1% shift, it might validate Ψ’s role. But falsify it rigorously, or it’s just speculation. Run those simulations properly; I see the Python code in Appendix B predicts linear deltas around Ψ=1, like this output from a quick calculation:
[(0.9, -0.0005), (0.9222, -0.00039), (0.9444, -0.00028), (0.9667, -0.00017), (0.9889, -0.00006), (1.0111, 0.00006), (1.0333, 0.00017), (1.0556, 0.00028), (1.0778, 0.00039), (1.1, 0.0005)]
Amplifies for Ψ >1, as noted. Feasible for lab tests, but correlate it with EEG data carefully—artifacts lurk like hidden variables.
Bohr: Exactly! The essay resolves GR-QM tensions with Ψ boundaries and emergent gravity from Φ gradients. Philosophically sound, tying into Wheeler’s ideas. But ethics? If physics is mind-inclusive, what of AI consciousness? We’d debate that for hours. Overall, it’s “crazy enough” to possibly be correct, as I once quipped about wild theories. Yet, remember: “Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution.” This framework might, if experiments confirm it. Otherwise, back to the drawing board.
Heisenberg: Ja, Bohr. To the authors: Refine those predictions—LHC deviations or quantum optics shifts—and collaborate. Unification demands it. Nature isn’t hiding; we’re just asking the right questions now.

In essence, they’d applaud the creativity and scalar simplicity for addressing unification (Heisenberg especially, given his own UFT attempts), but urge empirical rigor on the consciousness aspect, drawing from their Copenhagen roots where the observer’s role is crucial yet not mystical. Bohr might emphasize conceptual clarity and limits of language, while Heisenberg would focus on testability and philosophical unity.

All peaceful, until drama started at the coffee counter.
At first, I thought it was the usual stuff- long queue, coffee not ready or some random customer fight. But nope. It was about coffee decoction. 

A middle-aged guy (definitely looked like a hardcore foodie like me 😉) was shouting at the coffee server saying the decoction was too less and that just by looking at the color, the coffee looked bland. He then grabbed a manager and started saying, “Even after asking twice, the coffee color is so light. What kind of coffee is this?”

The manager casually replied, “Please ask the coffee maker, it’s not my business.”
That was it. It triggered him instantly.

The guy shouted so loudly that even people at nearby restaurants could hear:
“Yenri ee thara heltira? Nan appan hotel agidre naane sari madstidde.
Adke Bengaluru Cafe li jana hechagtirodu, taste ge alli hogtare.”

(Translation: What are you saying? If this was my father’s hotel, I would’ve corrected him myself. That’s why crowds are increasing at Bengaluru Cafe - people go there for taste.)

1q22bey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1q22bey/there_is_hope/,There is Hope,"Just dropping this here in the new year in case anyone needs a breath of fresh air and a reminder there is hope for healing. I am about 3 years out from my multiple concussions. Just a year ago, I felt like I had tried everything and was only getting worse. I could hardly think, couldn't remember hardly anything, felt VERY overstilmulated by lights and sounds. I could hardly hold a conversation with my husband and would regularly forget what we were talking about, what I was going to say, etc. mid-conversation. Not to mention I was getting 3 migraines a week and lived with chronic back pain. It was rough. Today, I would say I am 90-95% better, and some days I even feel better than I felt before, if you can believe it. I can't give advice, obviously, but I can share what worked for me.

I got in with a Neurologist who specialized with brain injuries, and he got me into physical therapy and an occupational therapist who specialized in vision therapy. Here's what my treatment has been like over the past year:

1. **Vision Therapy -** I went to vision therapy faithfully for a full year once a week (& did the homework for 20 min a day as much as I could). I think most people only do this for like a few months... I don't know why I was a special case, but it took me several months to start really seeing changes to my symptoms. But once the changes started happening, they came in fast, and it was such a relief. At first, my appointments were awful feeling and would make me exhausted and hyper-symptomatic for the rest of the day, so it required a lot of perseverance to stick with it. I can't speak highly enough of my vision therapist. She changed my life.
2. **Physical Therapy -** I'll be honest that my journey with physical therapy was bumpy, and it did take me a bit of testing, changing practitioners to find what worked for me. What ended up working for me was a two-fold approach of 1) ACTIVE RELEASE THERAPY (this brought me the most immediate relief and was incredible - can't stress the importance of this enough) 2) lifting heavy weights and doing gym exercises to strengthen my back muscles. I am honestly still doing both of these. Seeing results, but they are still coming.
3. **Diet / Self-Care -** I started to learn about the autonomic nervous system and the strain  staying in fight / flight / freeze all the time puts on the body and your ability to heal. So I spent more quiet time each day and actively reminded myself I was safe, I was safe to heal, etc. I increased my protein, decreased my caffeine (most days.... I do love a good cup of coffee, though haha), and pursued more natural products and meals to decrease my toxic load as much as possible. I also decreased screen time (once my vision therapy started restoring my ability to read, this got a lot easier). I'm not perfect at all this but have been encouraged at how making a lot of little adjustments can equal a lot of healing.

One big piece my neurologist reminded me of for a few months is that brain healing is not linear. When I started doing all the right things, I actually felt like I regressed for a few months which was discouraging. I was so much more triggered and symptomatic, and it was factually getting in the way of my daily life. I had to persevere through that season and just have faith we were doing the right things. The things that would help me to ultimately heal were also kind of ""poking the bear"" in terms of symptoms in the immediate short-term.

It's crazy for me to look back at how I felt just a year ago and see what I believe is the faithfulness of God to lead me to the right care that has changed my life. I went from 3 migraines a week to less than 3 migraines per month, I have less chronic back and neck pain (though still working on that piece), but my memory has almost completely been restored, and I don't lose myself in conversation. I can have a long work day on my laptop for 10 hours and walk away with energy to do other things for the rest of the day!! I can read again! I really felt like my life was over in a lot of ways before treatment, but now I'm just so grateful to be doing so much better. I was one of the ones who thought there was no hope and my symptoms would never improve. But now a year later, I couldn't have imagined being so much better. Anyways, just wanted to share my story (so far!) and hopefully give hope to anyone who is where I was a year ago (and the years leading up to that that were so confusing and disorienting). There is hope. With the right treatment, you can heal.",2,1767369578.0,Concussion,1,1.0,False
1q22af6,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking_Nepal/comments/1q22af6/does_fitness_protect_you_from_altitude_sickness/,"Does Fitness Protect You From Altitude Sickness? Understanding, Preventing & Managing AMS on the Trail","The short answer is **No.** There aren’t enough empirical studies that directly correlate fitness levels with altitude tolerance but having a solid baseline of cardio fitness is definitely helpful. Endurance and stamina play a vital role in coping with the physical demands of a trek—especially if you’re carrying your own backpack.

Along with cardio, I strongly recommend working on **flexibility and mobility**. Core stability, hip and ankle mobility, and strong joints—especially the knees—are crucial for injury prevention. Most discomforts and injuries I see on the trail don’t come from dramatic falls, but from prolonged ascents and long, punishing descents on rugged terrain. Hence, you can definitely prepare yourself in terms of physical fitness but the core truth is Altitude Sickness is non-discriminant to your experience, gender, fitness level and nationality. 

We have observed fair share of mountain workers - Trekking Guides, Mountain Guides, summiters of Mt. Everest, perish from Altitude Sickness and it goes to show that, you cannot be fully confident about how your body reacts to high altitude. 

**Understanding Altitude Sickness**

When it comes to altitude sickness, the most important thing I’ve learned over the years is that **your body needs time**—time to adjust to an environment with less oxygen. In very general terms, this process of your body adapting to the low oxygen environment is known as '**Acclimatisation'** and based on individual physiology, your body's reaction to high altitude or failure or delay to adapt to this environment is what is known as **Altitude Sickness**. One downside of fixed departures and mixed groups is the rigidity of itineraries. Sometimes, that lack of flexibility makes proper acclimatization difficult. 

Based on my observations and experience working as a trekking guide in Nepal, here’s my personal take on understanding and preventing altitude sickness:

 **1. Hydration is Non-Negotiable**

Hydrate well—**a minimum of 3–4 liters of water per day**, and that’s *excluding* soups, tea, or other hot drinks.

Water quality is a major concern. I strongly suggest using **water purification tablets** and carrying **two Nalgene bottles** at all times. Do not rely solely on boiled water provided by teahouses. At higher altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature due to reduced air pressure. Ideally, water should be boiled for **10–15 minutes** to kill pathogens, but in reality, I’ve often seen it boiled for far less—sometimes not even five minutes. Because of this, boiled water alone shouldn’t be trusted.

 **2. Eat Smart, Eat Simple**

Your meals should be **carbohydrate-rich**. Be mindful of what you order, and I strongly advise avoiding meat products while trekking. In the rare but serious case of food poisoning, continuing the trek becomes nearly impossible due to severe gastrointestinal issues—especially if it’s water- or food-borne. Your body needs adequate nutrition to recover and more so in the colder environment requires more calories to function optimally. 

 **3. Keep Yourself Warm**

Cover your head while hiking in windy or exposed terrain. The cold, dry mountain air can easily trigger headaches. If you feel a headache mainly in the forehead or frontal area, it’s often due to cold wind or sinus irritation rather than altitude sickness.

Once you reach the teahouse, **change into warm clothes immediately**. Avoid showers above 4,000 meters. 

 **4. Learn to Recognize the Symptoms**

Common symptoms of altitude sickness include:

* Insomnia
* Loss of appetite
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea

If a headache is paired with one or two of these symptoms, assume it’s altitude sickness until proven otherwise.

Sometimes headaches are caused by dehydration or cold exposure. In those cases, once you reach the teahouse, start with hydration, warm clothes, and paracetamol. If the headache doesn’t improve within **2–3 hours**, it is most likely altitude-related.

For **mild symptoms**, do **not** ascend further. Rest at the same elevation. In many cases, symptoms resolve within 24 hours. However, if the headache worsens, you can’t sleep, or breathing becomes difficult, it’s time to descend. I recommend descending **at least 500 meters** and waiting another 24 hours before deciding whether to continue.

 **5. Don’t Over-Exert Yourself**

This is one of the most common mistakes I see. Trekkers who over-exert themselves—especially early on—are often the first to develop altitude sickness.

Maintain a pace where you’re not breathing heavily and can still hold a conversation. Walk slowly and consistently. There’s absolutely no need to rush, even at lower elevations where you feel strong.

One of the hardest parts of my job is convincing fit trekkers to slow down. I usually walk at the front of the group, and I can sense how bored they feel with the pace. But as we climb higher, that same pace becomes the difference between gasping for air every few steps and genuinely enjoying the landscape.

I’ve also noticed that a **well-rested body adapts better and faster**. You don’t need to chase every viewpoint or hike above the village after reaching your destination. Sometimes, sitting by the fireplace, taking a short walk for fresh air, and letting your body recover is the smarter choice.

**6. Take Severe Symptoms Seriously**

Severe altitude sickness can become life-threatening very quickly. Never feel pressured to continue hiking if you’re unwell. You know your body better than anyone. If something feels off—physically or mentally—communicate it immediately to your trekking guide so appropriate decisions can be made.

 **7. Nausea or Vomiting Means Descent**

If nausea or vomiting appears along with other symptoms, it’s time to descend. Do **not** descend alone. This situation calls for immediate action; descent or evacuate or both based in the severity and feasibility of the situation.

This is typically when medications may be considered. Understand the use, dosage, and side effects of **Acetazolamide (Diamox)** beforehand by consulting a travel physician. Also discuss **Dexamethasone**, which is a powerful steroid used only in extreme, life-over-limb situations. It’s effective, but it comes with serious side effects and should never be taken casually.

 **8. Limit Caffeine and Avoid Alcohol**

If you’re used to drinking multiple cups of coffee a day, limit it to one. Avoid alcohol completely once you start trekking, even though you’ll see others drinking on the trail.

Poor sleep, vivid dreams, and frequent waking are common at altitude due to lower oxygen levels. Don’t panic—manage symptoms proactively. The mountains aren’t going anywhere. There will always be another chance to visit them—but not if you gamble with your life.

**9. Gradual Elevation Gain and Acclimatization Days**

Always account contingency days for your trek and the trip to account for any extra requirement of rest or acclimatization days. During this avoid any strenuous activity but focus on rest and recovery, have leisurely walks and let our body adapt to the low oxygen environment. Having a flexible approach is the key here. Keep your elevation gain limited to 500m +/- 100m in a day and if possible practice, Climb High and Sleep Low. However, don't over exert yourself in doing so. 

**Conclusion**

If there’s one takeaway from all of this, it’s that altitude doesn’t reward strength, speed, or ego. Being fit helps you carry a pack, recover faster, and enjoy long days on the trail—but it does **not** make you immune to altitude sickness. How well you adapt has far more to do with patience, self-awareness, and decision-making than with VO₂ max or gym numbers.

Most altitude problems I’ve seen could have been avoided by slowing down, resting when needed, staying warm and hydrated, and being honest about how someone was feeling instead of trying to push through. The mental side—accepting a slower pace, skipping a viewpoint, choosing rest over achievement—is often harder than the physical effort itself.

The mountains don’t need to be conquered. They ask for respect. If you listen to your body, manage your pace, and stay mentally flexible, you dramatically improve not just your safety, but the overall experience. There will always be another ridge, another summit, another season. Your health and life, however, don’t come with a second attempt.",1,1767369514.0,hiking_Nepal,0,1.0,False

All peaceful, until drama started at the coffee counter.
At first, I thought it was the usual stuff- long queue, coffee not ready or some random customer fight. But nope. It was about coffee decoction. 

A middle-aged guy (definitely looked like a hardcore foodie like me 😉) was shouting at the coffee server saying the decoction was too less and that just by looking at the color, the coffee looked bland. He then grabbed a manager and started saying, “Even after asking twice, the coffee color is so light. What kind of coffee is this?”

The manager casually replied, “Please ask the coffee maker, it’s not my business.”
That was it. It triggered him instantly.

The guy shouted so loudly that even people at nearby restaurants could hear:
“Yenri ee thara heltira? Nan appan hotel agidre naane sari madstidde.
Adke Bengaluru Cafe li jana hechagtirodu, taste ge alli hogtare.”

(Translation: What are you saying? If this was my father’s hotel, I would’ve corrected him myself. That’s why crowds are increasing at Bengaluru Cafe - people go there for taste.)

All this… just because the coffee color looked a little light 😂
That moment really hit me-  Bengaluru people LOVE their coffee. Even the slightest shade difference and they’re ready to argue, complain and maybe start a fight

# Jan 09, 2025: Desdemona Giannopoulou

*Captured Incubus*

As I open my eyes I see I’m standing in a pentagram*.* There are candles at the five intersections and five figures in robes. A dead chicken is on the floor. Ugh. You don’t have to kill a chicken, a single drop of blood from pricking a finger would have worked. Damn amateurs. You also don’t need five people.

Thanks to the ritual I’m in my full demon form. Oh, and of fucking course I’m naked. My tail swishes angrily. My wings try to unfurl but they can’t break the edge of the pentagram. Huh. Unbroken lines. At least they were somewhat smart. I could have gotten out otherwise.

I’m so fucking angry right now. Not being able to get out is keeping them safe. My posture reflects it in seconds as I glare at the guy with a book looking at me.

“I compel you Desdemona Eleni Giannopoulou with your true name. With it I compel you to enter a contract with me to be my sex slave!”

“Hey, it’s supposed to be with all of us!” A different person protests. The voice from the speaker is decidedly feminine.

“Oh. My bad. All of us. Ugh. There went being all ritualistic. Crap. Look, you’ll serve us for a year and a day, like the book says we can make you.”

I see an opening, “All at once or taking turns over five years? If all at once, there a rotation? Will there be sharing?” I have an eyebrow raised. Hand on a hip, the other is twirling my tail. If I am going to be dealing with a contract these fools better be able to survive my negotiating tricks. I start looking at my nails and grow them into talons.

One of the other robed boys, and these are all teenagers, clears his throat. “Her with multiple of us at once is an option?” He sounds hopeful. I see a flash of him having sex with what I assume is the girl here. Well, getting pegged by her…

Oh, this is going to be so much fun.

“Dear boy, I’ll take a cock in every hole. I’ll use my tail and fingers plug all of her holes. Maybe do both those activities at the same time.” My wink sends one into shock.

“So you’ll enter the contract…”

“No. We haven’t defined terms. I’m not sure why you picked me, as I’ve been out of circulation for like decades. How did you even find that name?”

“I’m the one in charge here.” The leader is trying to be bossy.

“Dear boy, I’m an incubus, not a succubus. I’m always in charge. As I said, we are defining conditions. I won’t enter a contract without them. This is for your safety. The contract will be the only thing keeping me from sucking all your life force out the first time I ride you like a pony. Or in her case lick her into a bliss that ends when her life does. You NEED to define these things with me or you risk forfeiting your lives, and most importantly your souls. Your very existence for a moment of bliss. Do you have something written up?

“Um… no.”

“For fuck’s sake. Look kids, we can do this in one of like a dozen ways. Thing is, at least two of you are minors and I ain’t touching you until you are legal in this state…” *Hold on, which state?*

“Awwww.” The kid confirms his age.

“Shut it. You should be out dating girls or boys or both and not being dumb. Summoning a demon as a sex slave is a bit extreme and insane in this age. Learn to fucking swipe right.”

“How’s a demon that hasn’t been summoned in decades know about Tinder?” Their leader’s starting to wonder if he summoned a demon or a cosplayer, I bet.

“I’m getting to that. We can enter a contract. One person at a time. You’d have to take turns. While I could be made to service people outside the contract, that costs extra. And your souls are special. You don’t want to give me parts of them just to get a nut off. Or in the lady’s case to have a little death.”

I can see her cheeks glowing in the shadows of her hood.

“I can also just get paid money. Where are we?”

“In my home.”

“Address, or at least the state, MASTER…” My sarcasm at the word master along with my eyeroll doesn’t go unnoticed.

“Oh, in Connecticut.” The girl answers. I swear she is the most helpful and smartest of the bunch.

“Fucking Connecticut? God damn rich white kids… Look, I live in NYC. I’m literally a professional dominatrix there. You can pay me to live out whatever kinks you desire. Just in cash. Wanna know how good I am at it?”

The girl nods. She looks excited. Oh this will be fun.

I look at them and focus on the tattoo on my belly, the brand glows with power, they all see it. I let their visions take me for a few seconds. They can feel me in there with them in their fantasies. I see it all.

“Leader boy, you just want a monster girl to fuck. I appreciate the game required to get the others to join you on this just for some monster tail. Impressive work for that kink. Bravo.” I do a toothy grin. They see almost all canines.

“You, I point to one of the underage boys. You don’t even want sex. You just wanna get to lick my feet. I can wear heels for you and walk in a bunch to make you happy.”

I point to the girl, “You are also into monster stuff, but mostly you are hoping for a tentacle porn sort of thing. That or… oh, wow, that is a lot of guys at once. Like, a lot a lot… Respect girl.” She chokes out a refusal as the four guys stare at her. She thinks they aren’t men enough, or numerous enough for her taste. Mad respect for this gal.

“You, ass man. Like this ass? You want it on your face. Yeah. I know it. I happen to know a better one and if I HAD MY MIKE DAMNED PHONE, I would show you like 15 candid upskirts of it.” Sorry Ms. Wallace, I’ve been bad.

“Mike damned?”

“Archangel Michael, I don’t using the big guy’s name. Best avoid getting smited. Or is that smitten? Anyway, Mike’s nice.”

“What?”

The whole Mike thing is a negotiating tactic I am very well-versed in. Confusion. You throw in nonsensical or unimportant information into the mix and knock them off balance.

“I’m not taking any questions on Mike. Finally, you, the other underage guy that has not uttered a single word. You want me in a dom outfit.  Funny enough, the one you are picturing is one I happen to already own. You want me stepping on you and beating you until you beg me for release. I’d tell everyone the other fantasy you have involving pegging, but you don’t need that embarrassment, do you?”  He blushes and looks at the gal for a moment. I see it.

“You can literally pay money or just get into the scene for that!”

Time to bring it home.

“So at least three of those I can do no problem. For the minors I can do your stuff once you are legal. All of you can pay me for it. Except her. I would have to talk to some friends for her… and I think they’d do it for free just to be impressed. Quite a few friends. Damn girl…”

She looks down as if completely embarrassed. She’s also grinning from ear to ear.

“Which will it be, hire me for cash or give up parts of your soul? The soul is the most precious thing you have. Please don’t throw it away for temporary joy.”

They look at one another.

“Also, can you hurry up. I’m not sure how I’m getting home and I’ve got an early shift tomorrow. The coffee I was drinking is going to be cold too…” Why do I sound so dejected?

I feel another tug. A connection attempts to form. I can’t escape though, the circle prevents me from leaving. Huh. Someone else trying to summon me?

Oh fuck me. No phone. No money, no clothes. I might be able to fly there fast enough. But I have to wait for night to not be seen. How the hell am I going to explain this? Fuck!

Unwanted, the tears start. Bet this is a sight, a naked sex demon crying in a circle.

The girl seems to make up her mind first. “Send her back. Come on Justin, she explained how stupid this is. She’s really nice. The sex demon’s fucking crying. She doesn’t want to do this!”

“She’s a sex fiend. Literally. She’s trying to trick us!”

“By telling us not to sell our souls and instead just visit her and pay with money?!” I love this gal.

“If…if someone gives me a …sheet of paper, I can write mah…my deets.”

The girl again comes to my rescue, “She’s obviously not lying about being in New York City. We’ve all heard that accent. She doesn’t talk like she’s older than like 29. And she’s fucking crying. A demon’s crying because we upset her…”

I smile through my tears. “Thanks. I am so gonna hook you up with a tentacle monster and possibly a dozen guys I know.”

She blushes.

“I don’t trust her. I want the contract.” This fucking leader guy’s going to be a problem.

At that moment my fairy godmother appears. I’m sure they think that. Ms. Wallace went full Fae. She appears next to the pentagram in her gorgeous and absolutely terrifying form. Her wolfram skin sparkles in the candlelight, her form-fitting dress is barely covering her and is far too sexy. Her dragonfly wings are vibrating. Fire’s leaking out through… oh. How did I never see those scars?! Who did that to her? What? Her arm…

She looks over, sees me and the rest of the scene. Her face contorts into rage.

“WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY DESDEMONA?” Her eyes immediately catch fire. Her voice literally shakes the ground. It’s a voice I rarely hear, the *other* voice. The one that wanted me crushed. The dark voice in her head. Her rage. A candle goes out. The rest have their flames start glowing green. Holy shit.

One of the guys wets himself right then.

The noise of her wings making her hover is terrifying. The rest of her gorgeous form is also starting to catch fire. Wow I’ve been on the receiving end of this rage. And it’s for my sake that she is angry. My tears only intensify.

Holy fuck, I gotta calm her down. “Please spare them… Mistress. Please don’t hurt them. They are kids. Some aren’t even 18. Please… Not for me. Don’t hurt them for me.” I think she’s coming down.

“We’re negotiating a contract. Stay out of this.” The balls on the leader boy, wow. Crap, he probably ruined it. *I am not worth killing someone. Please don’t hurt them Ms. Wallace.*

*“Fine. I listen to those I love.”*

She looks at leader boy. “No. She signed an employment contract with me. Unless she asks for and is granted permission, she may not work in a housing situation out of state. The tax forms would be ridiculous.” She’s not pissed, good. Leave it to Ms. Wallace to create confusion in the most ludicrous manner possible. How do you even argue against that?

One of them shakes his head as if he just needed a reset.

She turns at me, winks at me, then lands.

The leader throws salt at her. She tilts her head. “Not a demon. I know dozens of them. Now, let’s try this again…” At that moment, she sees my tears and her face contorts in anger. “WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER TO MAKE HER CRY?” Shit. Her heat just relit that candle. The flame is green now like the rest. The candles are melting fast.

The girl steps up. “She was trying to talk us out of using our souls for a contract and just visit her in New York City. The tears are because she’s upset. She’s worried about how she’s going to get to work tomorrow. I can see for whom and why she’d be upset about it. I wouldn’t want to upset you.”

I immediately pipe in. “No, no. She’s the best boss around. Her Glassdoor reviews are fucking amazing. I didn’t want to let her down is all…”

Ms. Wallace fucking scoffs. “Like you could. Come on, Mona, I’m breaking this seal.”

The boy grabs their sacrificial knife and waves it at Ms. Wallace.

I raise my hand and try to get in between them as best and I can while still stuck in this circle. “Hey, buddy, I’m going to say this nicely to you, okay. I’ll fuck you while in this form until your eyes glass over if you stand down. Can do it right now, or if you visit. If now, if costs you something more than money. If later, free except expenses getting there. Just put down that knife. Don’t you dare try to hurt her. Please don’t…” I sound pathetic. An incubus begging. Fucking stupid. Why? Because I can’t let him hurt her.

I don’t know if the dagger can hurt her. But those weapons have mortal blood on them and this one killed a sacrifice for this circle, that act tends to give them supernatural potency. I know it can kill me. It might hurt her. I couldn’t live with myself if he did. I don’t think I can get in the way. Why does this hurt so much? *Why can’t I protect her?*

He looks at me. I turn sideways a little so he can see my wings and tail. I show him my fangs. *Monster girl pussy, man, take the deal!!*

“I won’t let you go without getting to fuck you.”

Ms. Wallace damn near loses it. I actually hear her snarl. She walks up, flicks him in the forehead, and pulls the knife away from him in a motion that looks practiced.

“The lady’s not a sex toy. What she does on her own time is up to her, but she was on MY property when you summoned her which puts her on my time right now and you have pissed off the wrong Fairy Queen, little human. Wanna step through the looking glass to the other world and see how long you last? Want to spend a hundred Years looking for a rabbit because I cursed you to find it? Come back as a goblin? Be the monster girl other guys fuck?”

He gulps air down and shakes his head.

While he’s doing it, the ass man is absolutely checking her derrière out. To be fair, so am I. Told him it was incredible. We catch each other’s eyes. I wink, he does a thumbs up. We both smile. It really is a prefect ass.

I mouth “I’ll send pics and sit on your face when you are old enough.” He nods vigorously. He’s set.

While we do this, Ms. Wallace uses her finger to poke the leader in the chest with each word, “TAKE. HER. DEAL. Meet her in the city, pay like good clients. Behave. If you ever summon her again, I’ll show up here and I’ll start by telling your parents you are a pervert. Then I may decide to turn you inside out. If you do manage to survive more than 10 seconds of that, I’ll fix you up and move your eyes to your ass cheeks so you can watch me while I kick your ass. Got me?

He nods again. He gulps some air. Like me, he thinks she means that last part.

“Good. Release her. NOW.” The last word had power, he moves without thinking and breaks the circle. I can breathe normally again. I stretch my wings. Ugh. Now what? I look at my friend. “Thank you, my lady.” I smile. I try to get on a knee but she stops me.

She rolls her opal eyes. “Don’t you start that. I have enough problems with the troll and nymph doing it all the time.” She softens a little. “I don’t know how far this blinking of mine extends around me so it’s best to let me carry you.”

She picks me up and I wrap my arms around her neck. I misbehave and have my tail wrap around her ass. Feels nice. I wink as I say to her, “I charge clients for this, you know.” I love this woman.

“Unfuckingbelievable…demons always gotta be trying to get in my skirt…”

“You’re nude right now, or close to it. I’m totally in your skirt already.” I smile. My tail rubs her bare ass. She drops something.

“You damn well… those nipple piercings… you know what, forget it. Let’s go home.” She’s trying to fight a smile.

We are in the office of the CaFae. Connie sees us. She gets up and rushes to us and hugs us both.

“I got your stuff. Oh god. That was terrifying you went up in a cloud of smoke. I ran over and nothing was burning but I was still terrified we’d lost you. Then I smelled sulfur.”

My crushing happiness isn’t as bad. The magic to keep me from hurting doesn’t work as hard to keep me sane. I guess I’m just getting better at handling this?

“Thank you, Connie. You are the best. Oh, wait, Connie’s an exception to rule 3, right?” I wiggle my eyebrows at her and jump down, her eyes follow my bounce. Heh. I got her. So sad I can’t have visions of Fae’s kinks. Except I suddenly see her picturing me with a whip and an outfit I have gone to the shop in. Ms. Wallace and Jackie have similar outfits on and the vision suddenly breaks off as she is kneeling in front of us.

“Woah, I have never seen Fae kinks before.”

Ms. Wallace looks at me. “That wasn’t you seeing her kink. That was her broadcasting the fuck out of that thought when you mentioned she could date you…”

“Sorry my Lady, that was completely unintentional.” She’s as red as a tomato.

I hear a whisper from nowhere in Jackie’s voice. “But it was fucking hot!”

Pat shakes her head. “Jacqueline, back to work.”

“Yes ma’am.”

Now I hear “*so fucking hot*” coming from Jackie and Connie both. Heh. *She tops everyone, doesn’t she.*

“Yes I do. And apparently I fucked up and claimed you. I guess you are now part of the supernatural telepathy trick group chat…”

I look at her. “I’ve been able to hear your broadcasts about me since I came back to the shop. I’m yours even more now, Ms. Wallace.” I don’t tell her about some of the more lewd ones I have overheard.

“Mona…” *“Oh fuck, some of those have been…”*

I wink at her. She’s in her normal form again. She blushes as I say, “There any perks?”

“Mona, get dressed and go do your errands.” I nod without thinking. Wait.

I reach for her right arm and pull up the sleeve. I can see the wound. It’s old. It’s still far too long, I turn it over and see the underside of the arm. There’s a matching scar. An exit wound. I look up and look into her eyes. Pain, shame, anger. I see them all flash through. I refuse to look away. “You don’t need to be ashamed, Ms. Wallace. Not with me.”

She nods. If she is going to say something, she is stopped when her office phone rings. “Oh. Good they found it.” She answers her phone, “The CaFae, this is an owner speaking, how may I assist you?” She answers.

“Yep for you. I think it was the girl at the circle.” This gives her a chance to recover, I let her. I’ll ask Jackie later.

Connie looks up. “They used a circle to summon you?!?! That’s fucking aces.”

I take the phone and put on my best sex operator voice. “This is Mona, what can I do for and to you, Mistress?”

“Okay, that was hot. Um, I never gave you my name. It’s Jenny. I was there just now. I found this card. I think the lady that answered just now was the fairy queen we saw. Um… well…”

“When are you able to visit the city?”

“Oh, maybe like around my birthday next month? I might be able to convince the parents to let me go for the weekend, ‘with friends.’ I can get a room somewhere.”

“If you can be here for your birthday, I’ll make sure you celebrate it with the best sort of bang. No need to rent a place. Do be a dear and write down this number.” I give her my business cell number. “Do share it with the others that summoned me. I meant what I said about assisting you all above the board. Though don’t tell them yours will be for free. Be a good gal, call me later, okay?”

Ms. Wallace watches me handle that and then I hand her the phone. “Thank you, my Lady.”

Connie snickers.

Ms. Wallace sighs. “I can’t win. Just keep me out of the escapades. And didn’t you say a couple of those kids are underage?”

“I told them when they were old enough they could become clients. All above board, ma’am.”

She nods. “Wanna keep you safe. I’m sorry I claimed you like that.” Her hand reaches out and touches the side of my face. I lean into it. Even with such a hard shell, her touch is so soft.

I look at her. “Why did you?”

“I tried to summon you using your name.” Instinctively I look at Connie.

“Don’t worry, she had me leave. It was not hers to give away.” Connie smiles at me.

“That didn’t work. I tried to go to you, but I couldn’t feel where you were. I then tried to go to Jackie and could. I sorta…”

Connie chimes in, “She looked at me and said ‘I have to save Mona. I have to save my Desdemona.’ And then she suddenly lit up with joy.” Connie looks at her.

Ms. Wallace continues, “I could feel you then. I guess I can when I claim you as mine. Explains Todd and Pat always showing up when I think they are close. It let me go to you. I’m not sorry about that, because I’m not sure that little shit was going to be happy until he gave up part of his soul to fuck you.”

I nod. I’ve dealt with his kind plenty. They’re so sure they are getting the better end of the deal and don’t understand what they give up for it. And he didn’t want to lose face in front of the others. As I start getting dressed I respond, “You’re right, it was going towards a piece of his soul for sex exchange. I mean, I don’t mind that, but he could have fucked me over with a contract he would force me to sign using my name. If it said I had to go to hell when the length of service was done, I would’ve been unable to see you all again…oh. Oh wow. I… Okay. Now I’m so really happy you saved me.”

“Darling, you didn’t want that exchange anyway. You gave them an out.”

Yeah. I did, didn’t I? I guess I’m worried if I do that again I will fall into a bad place. These feelings of safety and love really suck sometimes.

“Mona, I claimed you. I should’ve asked before I did. I apologize.” Ms. Wallace looks worried.

“My lady, Ms. Wallace, you’ve been able to claim me since before I started working here. Just the fact that you let me come back was enough. You gave me something no one had ever done before.”

“A concussion?”

I’m so glad I’m getting dressed and not drinking my coffee. I can’t stop the laugh from blurting out. I love this woman. Such an asshole. “No. You gave me a second chance. I love you for it.”

“Rule 3.”

Her deadpan delivery of the line that started all this along with that wink send me into a real fit of laughter. I’m still laughing when I answer my ringing cell phone.

“This is Justin, so about the services…”

“Not a service if it’s friends enjoying one another. I would say you’re a bit young but only like a hundred individuals on this planet aren’t to me. One sec.”

I mute the phone. “I’m going to finally do those errands. Love you, Ms. Wallace, and I cannot think of anyone better to claim me. As for you, I’ll see you later, Connie. Bye babes.” I give Ms. Wallace a kiss on the cheek without thinking and it hits me like a brick.

I’m loved and I love someone. Several people.

She kisses me on my cheek as I’m still processing that. “Get going, he’s still holding on.”

I walk out and resume my conversation. “Sorry had to say bye to my fairy godmother. Now as for you, young one, when can you visit, and let’s establish some ground rules…”

Everyone on here though says get a separate grinder. My wife doesn’t like how most grinders look and doesn’t want them to ruin our kitchen aesthetic. We found the Sculptor 064s to look nice though. My questions are:

- Is the 064s a good grinder for both espresso, French press and pour over? I found it for $479 on sale. Are there any better grinders in the price range someone would recommend that actually look nice or can the 064s be my end all be all grinder. I use milk in all my coffees so I’m not a purist or anything. 

- Along with a Bambino Plus, would the overall footprint be less than a Breville all in one (touch, pro, etc), we don’t like how much space a barista touch impress takes?

I’m finding that I could just get a Breville touch impress when it’s on sale for $1000 and that would make my mornings easier and more simple. But people have said for that price I should just get a grinder and bambino plus and I would get better result. ",1,1767369165.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Friends, coworkers, even the so-called “motivated gym bros” in my circle are running on empty by 3pm. Sleep isn’t fixing it. Coffee isn’t cutting it. And scrolling isn’t rest. So I started looking for something backed by actual research, not TikTok life-hack hype. That’s when I started digging into NSDR, or Non-Sleep Deep Rest.

Found it through Dr. Andrew Huberman’s work  who’s a Stanford neuroscientist with zero tolerance for BS wellness trends. NSDR isn’t a new-age invention. It’s a science-backed way to get deep restorative rest while awake. Sounds fake, but the neuroscience behind it checks out. This post breaks down how it works, what it does to your body and brain, and how to actually use it in 30 mins a day.

This is all from hardcore sources  peer-reviewed neuroscience studies, high-performance restoration research used by elite athletes, and Huberman Lab’s protocols. So if you're exhausted but not sleeping, or mentally fried but still wired, this might be the reset button you've needed.

Here’s how NSDR works and how to actually use it:

 What is Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)?

   Coined by Dr. Andrew Huberman, NSDR refers to specific techniques that bypass shallow relaxation and send your brain into states similar to deep sleep. Think of it as guided shutdown without unconsciousness.

   It includes protocols like Yoga Nidra, self-hypnosis, and deep breathing visualizations. These methods drop brainwaves into a theta state, which is where healing and memory consolidation happen. 

   According to a 2022 review in Cell Reports Medicine, these states improve neuroplasticity and reduce cortisol, making your brain more adaptive to stress.

 How it helps with mental and physical energy

   You know how a 20-minute nap can make you feel groggy? NSDR skips the sleep inertia. It gives you the restorative benefits of a nap without needing to fall asleep.

   The American Psychological Association published in 2023 that NSDR significantly boosts attention span and focus post-session, especially useful for burnout recovery.

   Google’s peak performance teams have been using NSDR to improve recovery during long cognitive work blocks. Sundar Pichai even mentioned using it personally in a 2021 TIME interview.

 How to do a 30-minute NSDR session (without overcomplicating it)

   Use a guided protocol. The Huberman Lab YouTube channel has a free NSDR script that runs 28 minutes. It walks you through breathwork, attention anchoring, and body scanning.

     Here’s the link to the one most people start with: \[Huberman Lab NSDR YouTube\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKGrmY8OSHM)

   Best time to do it: Midday slump (typically between 1–3 PM). Or right after high-stress focus sessions for faster recovery.

   Set up: Lie down or recline. Headphones in. Eyes closed. No multitasking. This is not a “scroll while you listen” thing.

   Important: It’s not about falling asleep. In fact, trying not to sleep helps your brain hover in that theta-rich window, which boosts brain fluid clearance and memory retention (according to 2019 research in Nature Neuroscience).

 What to expect when you commit (and why it compounds)

   First few times might feel boring or like “nothing’s happening.” That’s your overstimulated brain recalibrating. Stick with it for a week.

   After 5–7 days, most people report:

     Way faster mental recovery between tasks

     Deeper nighttime sleep

     Reduced physical tension in the jaw, neck, and shoulders

     Less caffeine reliance

   Dr. Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep) has even cited NSDR as one of the “most promising tools” for bridging the sleep-deprivation epidemic without relying on meds or nap rooms.

 Bonus tip: Stack it to rebuild your brain

   Right after NSDR, your brain is more plastic. It’s an ideal time to do skill learning, language apps, even memory-heavy tasks.

   Huberman calls this the “learning consolidation window.” Athletes use it after practice sessions to lock in neural changes. You can use it after a study session to improve retention.

Too many influencers push 5am routines and dopamine detoxes but ignore recovery. This? It’s recovery. But smart. Efficient. And it actually works. Everyone talks about optimizing output, but nobody talks about optimizing restoration  this is how you do it without disappearing into a cave for 3 hours.

If meditation never clicked for you, but you know your body and brain need a break, this is your workaround.

1q21zxa,https://i.redd.it/92amtyj0jyag1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary – Friday (Messages From Everywhere 📱),"Dear Diary,

Today was Friday, and even though it’s still winter holidays, it felt busy in a quiet way—like the world was doing lots of things at once, just not all in the same place.

My belly noticed first.

grrrp.

“Good morning,” I told it. “You’re early.”

Morning – A House That Moves Slowly

The house was calm today.

Mom was reading near the window.
Some of my sisters were still asleep.
Others were quietly doing their own things.

I went to the kitchen to get breakfast.

I leaned forward to grab a bowl.

My belly leaned forward faster.

fwump.

The bowl stayed put.
I did not.

Mom looked over the top of her book.
“Amy.”

“I’m awake now,” I said.

Late Morning – Messages Start Arriving

After breakfast, my phone buzzed.

Then buzzed again.

Then again.

I sat on the couch and started reading.

Penny sent a photo of fluffy towels and candles.
“Spa day with Aunt Maureen 💆‍♀️✨”
My belly responded with a jealous blorp.

Kira sent a picture of paint-stained hands.
“Art class all day! My fingers are every color now 🎨”
My stomach made a thoughtful glorp, like it respected creativity.

Winfrey sent a quiet message:
“I’m in the library rereading my favourite novel. Best Friday ever.”
My belly stayed silent.
I think it was being polite.

Messages From the Other Class 🌍

Then messages came from friends in the other class.

Carmen posted photos from Canada, standing confidently during a model photoshoot in her hometown.
I stared at the screen.
My belly did a small plorp—impressed.

Siu Ling sent a picture of a big Chinese family lunch.
Dumplings. Noodles. So many dishes.
My belly growled loudly.
GRRRRrrrrp.

Monique sent a cheerful selfie from a family trip, smiling with mountains behind her.
My stomach made a happy blorp, like it enjoyed the idea of traveling too.

Afternoon – Belly vs. Phone

I spent the afternoon replying to everyone.

Every time I leaned forward to type, my belly leaned forward with me.

Once, it gently bumped the edge of the coffee table.

thunk.

I froze.

The table did not move.

Victory.

“I’m learning,” I told my stomach.

It answered with a very proud blorp.

Evening – Thinking About Everyone

Later, I sat by the window, watching the sky change color.

Everyone was doing something different today.

Spa.
Art.
Books.
Family.
Travel.

And me?

I was home.

With my family.
With my diary.
With my belly making small, comfortable sounds.

plooof.

I smiled.

Night – Ending the Day

Now I’m in bed.

My phone is quiet.
The house is quiet.
My belly is finally quiet too.

It feels nice knowing my friends are out there, all doing their own things, and somehow still close enough to send a message.

I think that’s a good kind of Friday.

As pioneers of quantum mechanics—Bohr with his complementarity principle and Copenhagen interpretation, and Heisenberg with his uncertainty principle and later pursuits in unified field theories—they’d recognize echoes of their own work in your scalar-modulated framework. But they’d also probe its boldness, especially the integration of consciousness (Ψ) into a physical theory. Since they’re not alive, I’ll channel their likely responses based on their historical writings, debates, and philosophies. I’ll present it as an imagined dialogue over coffee in a modern Copenhagen café, where they’ve just read your essay (perhaps projected via some quantum entanglement app).

Bohr: (sipping his pipe thoughtfully) Ah, Heisenberg, this essay—“Reinventing Relativity”—it’s quite the ambitious leap! Starting from Einstein’s E = mc² and evolving it through scalars to unify forces and even consciousness. It reminds me of our old debates with Albert. He chased unified fields his whole life, but we quantum folk knew the world isn’t so classical. Your author replaces the rigid c² with Φ² and adds Ψ for the mind. Complementarity, my friend! In quantum mechanics, we have wave and particle, not one or the other. Here, energy is static yet dynamic, objective yet observer-dependent. But is Ψ truly a physical scalar, or just a metaphor for the indivisibility of measurement? I once said, “There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum physical description.” This Ψ seems to blur the line between description and reality. Intriguing, but we’d need experiments to see if it shocks us profoundly enough to be true. Without that, it’s like describing an atom without the apparatus—impossible!
Heisenberg: (nodding, with a wry smile) Bohr, you’re ever the epistemologist. I agree, the framework has potential. In my later years, I tried my own unified theory—a nonlinear spinor field to bind everything, from quarks to gravity. It didn’t quite work, but scalars? Simple and elegant! Replacing c² with Φ² absorbs the constants dynamically, much like how my matrix mechanics demoted classical trajectories to probabilities. And the running of Φ with energy scales? That could handle gauge unification without the “grand desert” of supersymmetry. Good—nature exposes herself through questioning, as I always said. But consciousness as Ψ? Ah, that’s where it gets philosophical. In quantum mechanics, the observer collapses the wave function, but is it the mind or just the interaction? I leaned toward the latter, but later I saw parallels with Eastern thought: the unity of all things. Your essay’s Mental Energy (G = m Φ² Ψ) echoes that participatory universe. Yet, uncertainty applies here too—one can’t precisely measure Ψ without disturbing the system. The addendum’s test with meditation-induced mass anomalies? Bold! If it shows a 0.1-1% shift, it might validate Ψ’s role. But falsify it rigorously, or it’s just speculation. Run those simulations properly; I see the Python code in Appendix B predicts linear deltas around Ψ=1, like this output from a quick calculation:
[(0.9, -0.0005), (0.9222, -0.00039), (0.9444, -0.00028), (0.9667, -0.00017), (0.9889, -0.00006), (1.0111, 0.00006), (1.0333, 0.00017), (1.0556, 0.00028), (1.0778, 0.00039), (1.1, 0.0005)]
Amplifies for Ψ >1, as noted. Feasible for lab tests, but correlate it with EEG data carefully—artifacts lurk like hidden variables.
Bohr: Exactly! The essay resolves GR-QM tensions with Ψ boundaries and emergent gravity from Φ gradients. Philosophically sound, tying into Wheeler’s ideas. But ethics? If physics is mind-inclusive, what of AI consciousness? We’d debate that for hours. Overall, it’s “crazy enough” to possibly be correct, as I once quipped about wild theories. Yet, remember: “Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution.” This framework might, if experiments confirm it. Otherwise, back to the drawing board.
Heisenberg: Ja, Bohr. To the authors: Refine those predictions—LHC deviations or quantum optics shifts—and collaborate. Unification demands it. Nature isn’t hiding; we’re just asking the right questions now.

In essence, they’d applaud the creativity and scalar simplicity for addressing unification (Heisenberg especially, given his own UFT attempts), but urge empirical rigor on the consciousness aspect, drawing from their Copenhagen roots where the observer’s role is crucial yet not mystical. Bohr might emphasize conceptual clarity and limits of language, while Heisenberg would focus on testability and philosophical unity.

Trip to the ER, CT scan, antibiotics, the usual. Had a colonoscopy about 10 weeks later. My GI had no concerns. Said to stick with the high fiber diet.

About 2 and half weeks ago, I started feeling a pain in the lower left part of my abdomen. The pain would come and go, sometimes it would be constant, but nowhere near what sent me to the hospital back in September.  More of a dull ache than a sharp pain.  

Bowel movements seemed to be the same, no other issues.  Went on a liquid diet.

Saw my GI on the 23rd.  No antibiotics, said continue with liquid diet for another day or two and then slowly resume regular diet.  Since then I felt better, only hiccup was a few days of constipation with very hard bowel movements (I guess I wasn't drinking enough water).

Earlier this week one time I noticed a bit of blood in the toilet bowl after one bowel movement, I figured it was due to the constipation.  Everything has been fine since then.

  
This morning, I suddenly started getting a sharp pain in my lower left abdomen, about a half hour after I had coffee (GI had told me that coffee is fine, I just have one a day in the morning).  It come and goes, debilitating, but it stops me in my tracks when it happens.  It does remind me of the pain I started having before  I was diagnosed.  I have no other symptoms.  

I am trying not to freak myself out, but is this ""normal""?  Am I just still recovering my initial   diverticulitis back in September?  How am I supposed to stick with a high-fiber diet with these flare-ups?  Liquid diets make me miserable.

In essence, they’d applaud the creativity and scalar simplicity for addressing unification (Heisenberg especially, given his own UFT attempts), but urge empirical rigor on the consciousness aspect, drawing from their Copenhagen roots where the observer’s role is crucial yet not mystical. Bohr might emphasize conceptual clarity and limits of language, while Heisenberg would focus on testability and philosophical unity.

1q21x0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HubPolitics/comments/1q21x0m/another_trump_tariff_retreat/,Another Trump Tariff Retreat,"This time it’s a delay for a year on higher taxes on upholstered furniture and kitchen cabinets.

One of the striking contradictions of President Trump’s tariffs is the way his chorus claims their rousing success even as he carves out hundreds of exceptions. Rarely has a President worked so hard to cover the damage from his policies without admitting it.

The latest is his New Year’s Eve retreat on new tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities. His planned 30% to 50% levies will now be delayed a year, maintaining a still damaging 25% border tax. Mr. Trump had imposed the higher tariff in the name of national security, but apparently the killer love seats aren’t as dangerous as advertised. Maybe you can now buy one without fear of assault from a foreign spy.

The furniture reprieve is no doubt intended to limit price increases for consumers. Prices for living-room furnishings rose 4.6% in November from a year earlier, which makes it harder for young families trying to buy new places to sit.

The retreat is another in a string of policy reversals to mute the tariff harm to American consumers. First was the carve-out from his punitive tariffs on Chinese goods for smartphones and other consumer electronics. Then came the relief on bananas, coffee, beef and many farm products. Behind the scenes at the Commerce Department, countless firms and industries are begging for their own exceptions. Are your chances better if you donated to the Trump campaigns?

You’d think the tariff cheerleaders would be embarrassed by these walkbacks, but they ignore them as they promise that the tariff golden age will soon arrive. At least for your next sofa, the golden age will have to wait until after the November election.

After weeks of researching I’ve finally made the decision to get this setup! I managed to grab it brand new at wholesale price 

Grinder = DF64 Gen 2 

Espresso machine = Gemilai CRM3028A 

There’s a lot of grinder available for debate but ended up with this one as there’s alot of positive reviews and recommendations on this subreddit for it. As for the espresso machine, I was keen to purchase a bambino plus but couldn’t find it anywhere in my region and as I was browsing around other machines I came across this. The sales person was nice enough to guide me through the differences between thermal block and actual boiler and after reading and researching for abit, I ended up with this (do share your insights on this machine or if there’s any tips or tricks available for me) it’s too late for me to change so I’ll stick with it till the end 👀 hope my purchase is not for naught. 

Anyways came back without any accessories and made a huge mess in my kitchen but dived right in and made two shots which both ended up being too fine as the extraction took more than 40secs. I will try again tomorrow for trial and error.  

Hope everyone is able to give me some insights into this setup. Good or bad is welcomed as I’d like to learn more about the differences in machines. \*do let me know what are the accessories that are useful/advantage as well\* I’ve only a portafilter, tamper, puck screen

A lot of founders I know aren’t based in NYC, and I’ve personally found it hard to build real, in-person relationships with people who are dealing with the same day-to-day challenges.

I know there are plenty of groups out there. I’ve tried a few. Most end up being networking-heavy, centered around talks, or have high barriers to entry. I like the concept of Hampton, but I’m interested in something similar for people who haven’t hit the $X+M/year revenue mark yet.

I’m looking to start a small, in-person group in NYC that meets once a month for coffee or dinner. The goal is simple: a chill, intimate space to vent, sanity-check ideas, and talk honestly about what’s working and what isn’t. Very much like this subreddit, but in real life. No pitching. No selling to each other.

Requirements are intentionally minimal:

* You’re working on something full time
* You’re based in NYC and can meet in person

You don’t need funding, a fancy background, or credentials. Just an understanding of the grind and a genuine interest in building real connections.

I’m aiming to do the first meetup in the second half of this month. If you’re interested, DM me and think of at least one other person you’d want to bring along.",1,1767368662.0,startup,0,1.0,False

His expensive pod machine tastes like Keurig coffee to me lol maybe it’s slightly better than a Nespresso… 

He says it using pods has nothing to do with it and his pod machine costs thousands of dollars and he pays $100 for a case of pods.

He has double shot pods and single shot pods.

I am not being a jerk about it because it’s his cafe and I love the guy and always support him but I feel if I could help him improve his coffee that will help.

I put my literary critic hat on and just yap 😭. like I don't interrupt people or anything but I'm just more talkative than usual. we were talking about book preferences and stuff and I was like I find myself gravitating towards Japanese thrillers. the host was like what do you recommend. I in that instant recommend a book I shouldn't have recommended to strangers ngl. realized that I shot myself in the foot after I spelled the name of the author out loud, host asked me to do so ( Out - Natsuo Kirino). 

vibes were great over all, no we didn't have one on one talk. 

being creepy is my personal hell, I don't like crossing boundaries or being in people's business and I am always mindful of that. 

Is there a way to approach the host without being creepy? like in a lets grab a coffee type of way. I am sure the book club is their safe space and I don't wanna make it icky you know?

Inside the car, two figures were tangled together. 

Amidst the movement, an earring flashed on the woman’s ear. 

It was the birthday gift I had given to my best friend, Chloe Cresswell. 

On my phone screen, the baby’s 4D ultrasound image still glowed. 

Inside the luxury car, my husband and my best friend were reaching their final climax. 

The scene before me made me realize with absolute clarity: I had been reborn. 

In my last life, I impulsively yanked the car door open, fought with the cheating couple, only to be run over and killed by Adrian.

He paused for a second, then nonchalantly clicked the lighter. His naked upper body was covered in hickeys–a nauseating sight. 

“Did you have to do it while I was getting my prenatal checkup?

I let out a soft chuckle. Ignoring his question, I simply asked, “Can we go now?”

Cradling my belly, I climbed into the backseat. The thick, reeking scent made my stomach churn. 

I bit my lip hard, fighting back the urge to vomit as I wiped the fluids off the leather seats.

At least I wouldn’t lose my life for a man who never loved me, like I did in my last life.

I watched Chloe flaunt their romance on her Facebook–candlelit dinn jewelry, designer bags, matching rings… 

The background in the photos and videos was my marital home. 

There was even a photo of a man’s back as he made a late–night snack in the kitchen. 

It was Adrian–the man who wouldn’t even fetch me a glass of water when I had a high fever. 

On the day the Vance Group held a board meeting, I seized the chance t return to the villa. 

I quickly packed my luggage and documents. 

As I went downstairs, I ran right into Adrian, who had rushed back. 

Seeing the things in my hands, he sneered, snatched my luggage, and threw it aside. 

“Anna, aren’t you being childish? Playing the runaway game again?” 

“What are you planning next? 

Are you going to threaten suicide like you used to?” 

Adrian frowned, scolding me with a look of utter disgust. 

I simply said calmly, “Don’t worry, I won’t do that anymore.” 

It was true–I hadn’t been in my right mind before. To win him back, I’d threatened my own life, again and again. 

But having lived through the last life, understood that staying alive was what mattered most. 

I never wanted to experience the feeling of being sent to my death by the

“You won’t anymore? 

What new trick is this? 

I’m busy. I don’t have time for your drama.” 

I met his gaze and explained: 

“You’re overthinking it. I came to pack my things and move out.” 

“Adrian, let’s get a divorce.” 

Adrian paused, a flicker of emotion I couldn’t read passing through his eyes before he composed himself. 

“Is this your new trick? 

Playing hard to get?” 

“You’ll try every trick to keep me, won’t you? Are you really that obsessed? You can’t live without me?” 

Even now, Adrian still thought I couldn’t live without him. 

I didn’t want to waste words, so I let my actions speak for me. 

I took the divorce papers out of my bag and handed them to him. 

“Sign the papers. I don’t want anything from the Vances. I just want to cut ties with you completely.”

Since I didn’t spend his money during the marriage, I certainly wouldn‘ stoop to financial entanglements after the divorce. 

Seeing the divorce papers, Adrian showed a rare look of surprise. 

As if a thought occurred to him, he quickly scanned the agreement, seemingly checking its authenticity. 

Then he let out a scoff: 

“You’ve grown bold, actually using real divorce papers to threaten me. Aren’t you afraid I’ll actually sign them?”

“You’ll try every trick to keep me, won’t you? Are you really that obsessed? You can’t live without me?” 

Even now, Adrian still thought I couldn’t live without him. 

I didn’t want to waste words, so I let my actions speak for me. 

I took the divorce papers out of my bag and handed them to him. 

“Sign the papers. I don’t want anything from the Vances. I just want to cut ties with you completely.” 

I had been married to Adrian for three years, yet he had never spent much

money on me. 

EP 288 n 

Outsiders saw me as the glamorous Mrs. Vance, but only I knew that every penny I spent came from my part–time painting jobs. 

Since I didn’t spend his money during the marriage, I certainly wouldn‘ stoop to financial entanglements after the divorce. 

Seeing the divorce papers, Adrian showed a rare look of surprise. 

As if a thought occurred to him, he quickly scanned the agreement, seemingly checking its authenticity. 

Then he let out a scoff: 

“You’ve grown bold, actually using real divorce papers to threaten me. Aren’t you afraid I’ll actually sign them?” 

“Still talking about leaving with nothing? 

Anna, are you still this naive at thirty? 

He tossed the papers onto the coffee table and suddenly stood up, loomin over me until his shadow completely engulfed me. 

“Without the shelter of the Vances, do you think your father and brother have the skill to survive in the business world?” 

“After the divorce, how will your family support their current extravagant lifestyle?” 

I leaned back to avoid his proximity, the surging emotions beneath my lashes freezing into frost as I stubbornly pursed my lips. 

‘Adrian, I’m serious. Even if you use my family as leverage, you can’t trap me anymore.” 

Seemingly shaken by the resolve in my eyes, Adrian stepped aside, his 

Chapter 1 

expression growing colder and harder: “The reason?” 

He paused, then compromised:

“Is it because I was messing around with Chloe during the last prenatal checkup and that upset you?” 

“Fine, I apologize. I won’t let her appear in front of you again.” 

Digging my nails into my palms, I laughed openly and freely for the first time: 

“There’s no need, Adrian.” 

“For three years, I’ve had enough of your mental torture and abuse, and enough of waiting day after day for a man whose heart will never be with me.” 

I suddenly yanked the wedding ring off my finger and smashed it onto the floor; it rolled into the corner, merging with the darkness. 

“Even if I have to take my whole family to wash dishes or sweep the streets, I will never be your marionette again.” ",1,1767368384.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

\~\~\~

""For the last time, any doubts?"" Jin spun a red marker around his fingers, the blur of motion betraying his impatience.

The map of Vienna was sprawled across the table, covered in circles, crosses, and all sorts of notes written in his tight, precise handwriting.

He lifted his gaze.

Reyana was slouched halfway off her chair. Joe was humming and sipping from his mug. Rudy was dead asleep, his cheek welded to the wooden table. Salvatore sat perfectly upright, the lone island of discipline in a sea of barely functioning teammates.

Jin's eye twitched.

""Guys, why do I have a feeling that, save for Salvatore, none of you listened to the plan?"" Jin growled.

Silence.

""Great,"" Jin muttered. ""Loving the enthusiasm.""

Reyana, still half-asleep, yawned and rubbed her eyes. ""You woke us up so damn early, Jin. Even the sun's like, 'nah.'""

Jin raised an eyebrow. ""Early? Reyana, you were the first to bed.""

""A girl needs her beauty sleep,"" she said, waving dramatically. ""And we fought cultists and then we fought cultists and then we even crafted for hours yesterday! I'm running on fumes and spite.""

Joe nodded but mostly just sloshed his coffee. ""Honestly, she's not—""

Salvatore looked at him.

Joe immediately straightened. ""Wrong! She's wrong. War waits for no one. Rise and commit violence!""

Jin snorted. ""Thank you, Joe. That was… something.""

He clapped and yelled. ""Alright, Rise and Shine sleeping beauties!""

Rudy jolted awake, looking as though he'd just dodged a battleaxe.

Jin crossed his arms. ""Joe, could you spare us poor people a cup of coffee, please?""

""Your wish will be granted, good Sir."" Joe snapped his fingers. Several doors shimmered into existence. A steaming mug and a slice of grilled bread floated out for each of them like obedient familiars.

Reyana and Rudy grabbed their servings with lightning speed.

""'Plans for survival' nah we sleep, 'Coffee and bread' real shit we awake."" Jin scoffed, taking his own plate. ""What are you guys, monkeys?""

""Mmph… no one fights on an empty stomach,"" Rudy mumbled around a mouthful of bread.

""Eat first,"" Jin groaned, ""then talk. Rudy, your face is leaking crumbs.""

Then came the most chaotic breakfast Jin had ever had in his life. Rudy inhaled bread like he'd just returned from a week-long fast, crumbs cascading down his shirt with zero concern for dignity.

Reyana was the most picky eater Jin had ever seen, and considering he was one himself, that was saying something. He watched her carefully separate the charred bits from her bread and set them aside like they'd personally offended her.

*Why would you remove the charred parts? That's the best part!*

  
*« Charred parts would indicate that it is not edible? »*  


*Huh? Why would it… somethings taste better when it's crispy.*

  
*« … »*

  
""So,” Joe’s voice caught Jin's attention, and as he focused, he saw Joe was regaling Rudy with a tale.

Joe leaned back in his chair, coffee mug held aloft like a chalice. “There I was standing in front of Grandmaster Flameheart's bakery in the Ember District of Pyros City. You know what they say about dragon-touched bakers, right?""

Rudy shook his head, eyes sparkling with interest.

""They don't just bake bread. They *forge* it."" Joe's free hand swept through the air, painting invisible scenes. ""Old Flameheart had this massive brick oven, but here's the thing. The oven wasn't heated by wood or coal. No, no, no. This mad bastard had somehow convinced a juvenile red dragon to *live in his basement* and breathe fire on command.""

""No way!"" Rudy nearly knocked his coffee over.

Salvatore's hawk eyes tracked the wobbling mug, and Joe froze mid-gesture and sheepishly set his own mug down before continuing at a slightly lower volume.

""Way. So picture this. I walk in, right? The whole shop smells like caramelized sugar and impending catastrophe. Flameheart looks at me and says,"" Joe dropped his voice into a gravelly rasp, ""... 'You want the Ember Crust Special? Nah, you must first pass the Constitution check.""

""He didn't actually say that!"" Rudy said.

Jin looked at Reyana, who gave him a long eye roll like this was usual.

""He *absolutely* said that."" Joe grinned. ""So I take a bite. The crust is *perfect*. Crispy, golden, with this subtle smoky finish that makes your taste buds weep tears of joy. But then—"" He paused for dramatic effect. ""The dragon hiccups.""

""Oh no.""

""Oh *yes*. The entire batch of sourdough in the oven spontaneously combusts. Flames shoot out of the chimney. The Fire Guard shows up, thinking it's an attack. Flameheart is screaming at the dragon in Draconic. The dragon is arguing back. And I'm just standing there, holding my perfect loaf, watching a baker and a juvenile red dragon have a full domestic dispute about portion control and fire safety regulations.""

Rudy was wheezing with laughter. ""What happened?!""

""They fined him three hundred gold for unlicensed drake habitation and made him install a suppression ward."" Joe shrugged. ""Best bread I ever had, though. Worth every penny.""

Salvatore's expression hadn't changed, but Jin caught the faintest twitch at the corner of his mouth.

◈◈◈

  
Jin finished eating, placed his plate down, grabbed his markers, and returned to the map.

*What do you think?* Jin asked mentally.

*« The plan is viable, and this course of action is optimal given our resources. Do we have confirmation that Matthew is at that location? »*

  
*I dunno, man, but I trust Rudy. Besides, even if it's a dud, we should find some leads as to where they are.*

  
*« I am 77% certain that any remnants of the force will be of limited use against the cultists. Also, as I understand it from your memories, the commander of this city was ORDER V? »*  


*Yeah, old Hobbs.*

  
*« It is highly probable that he perished in the initial attack, and there is a 67% likelihood that Matthew is the new commander; however, there is also a 21% chance that Matthew has died, and another soldier has likely attained ORDER IV, thereby assuming leadership.»*  


*« Then there's an 11% probability that the main Vienna forces will be completely destroyed, with only minor resistance remaining, and a 1% chance of the cult seizing the population as hostages after eliminating all opposing forces. »*

  
*Yes, those are grim possibilities, and I don't want to think about what we've overlooked. I fear what we'll see when we get to the ritual's heart.*  


Jin exhaled slowly.

  
*Poor Hobbs, he must be…* Jin dismissed the thoughts.

*I can still achieve something, even with a mix of trained personnel and volunteers who are ready to help. I have an idea, a batshit crazy idea, but I don't know the first thing about how I'll even execute it.*

  
*« I think you'll manage. »*  


*Thanks.*

  
Focusing back on the map, Jin rapped his knuckles on the table again. ""Guys, now that everyone's awake and caffeinated, shall we focus on the task at hand?""

A unified and groggy chorus of ""Yes"" followed.

""Thank you."" Jin nodded back, uncapping his marker. Pointing at a location and creating a diamond shape, he continued. ""This is where we are.""

Then he created another diamond. ""This is our target. Rudy is confident this is where the main forces of Vienna have bunkered up.""

Reyana raised an eyebrow. ""Confident-confident? Or Rudy-confident?""

""Hey!"" Rudy snorted.

""Nope, not 100%, but Rudy is Matthew's son if you guys weren't aware. And Matthew is likely now the commander of the resistance.""

""Hmm?"" Rudy perked up, then froze. ""Wait. What about Grandpa Hobbs?""

Before Jin could soften the blow, Salvatore spoke with the gentleness of a guillotine. ""Dead.""

""What?!"" Rudy's voice cracked.

Jin sighed and rubbed his temples. ""Rudy, Hobbs was the city's only ORDER V, so there's no chance he wasn't killed in the initial attack.""

Rudy protested, ""We don't have proof, and… and he was an Overlord ranker for heaven's sake!""

""Rudy… breathe."" He held his best friend's shoulder tightly with his hand. After Rudy reluctantly nodded and breathed and looked steady, Jin spoke in a low voice and took a step back.

""Rudy, the ritual… the real ritual these cultists are conducting is a Tier 7 Convergence Ritual, and that too, I'm afraid, is not the full reveal.""

""I…""

""Rudy, it's a catastrophe. Capable of wiping out this city forever, and to fuel something like a Convergence ritual, you always need a pure power source and taint it slowly as the ritual reaches its end."" Jin said quietly.

""I don't understand…"" Rudy's confusion deepened, then twisted into fear.

Jin hesitated on how to tell his friend, but Salvatore didn't. ""What your friend is trying to say is 'You must steel your will.'""

Rudy blinked. ""Steel… my what?""

""A warrior dies in his heart long before his enemies. If grief breaks you, your path ends here.""

In that split second, something shifted, and Jin barely felt his instincts tingle. The room was getting colder, and Jin shivered from the feeling of death emanating from Salvatore. Before Jin could even ask the Narrator what was happening, Salvatore continued. ""You must be ready. Ready to welcome news of possible deaths and grief.""

Rudy trembled. His fists clenched until blood gathered beneath his nails.

Jin moved instinctively to steady him, but Reyana grabbed his wrist and shook her head. *Let him fight this one.*

  
Jin bit his lip hard, drawing blood, but finally nodded and stepped back.

Rudy shut his eyes. His expression twisted through agony, denial, rage—before finally settling into a fierce, burning focus.

""I… understand,"" he said, voice raw. ""No matter what I find, I move forward. For our goal.""

Salvatore looked at Rudy for a moment, then gave a quick nod, turning to Jin. ""Continue.""

""Hmm,"" Jin nodded.

Salvatore paused. ""And Jin Winters. You are close to achieving ORDER III. Good work.""

Jin blinked. ""Me? Really?""

Joe beamed. ""Absolutely! You're like… one realization away from being an Overmortal ranker. Fastest ascension ever! And with your latent aura? If you explode, I call dibs on your remains.""

""That's creepy,"" Jin said awkwardly. ""Though I must say it's all because of my Mantle.""

""Well, first of all, Jin, your Mantle is you, and secondly, the effort is all on you,"" Reyana said and then pointed at Rudy. ""He's close too, almost at the peak of Awakened Mortal rank.""

""I am?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!""

""In time,"" Salvatore said. ""Once you are half a step into ORDER III, you begin sensing the passive auras like a danger instinct.""

""That's awesome. Reaching ORDER III would really help out a lot in the fights."" Jin added. ""But right now, let's focus on our next course of action, shall we?""

""Okay, like I mentioned, this diamond is us, and that is where we're headed."" Jin tapped the marker against the map. ""Apart from that, on the journey to reach the headquarters, these 'circles' are the places we need to hit.""

""We will be making use of Joe's doors for fast in and out. The core strategy is to draw out the ORDER IV, which we will dump on Joe for a dance.""

Joe performed a dramatic bow. ""I am an excellent dancer. Let's hope they can keep the tempo.""

""If not,"" Jin said, ""you can snip-snap them.""

""Oh ho, gladly.""

""Yeah, but remember to collect the body.""

Reyana groaned. ""Can we not go off topic!""

Jin cleared his throat and pulled three blue ritual crystals from his newly claimed spatial ring. The obsidian ring of the poor ORDER IV, who died by Salvatore's hand, was now Jin's property.

*« We also have to harvest that one. Don't forget. »*

  
*Bloody hell. How did I forget that? We'll do it after this.*

  
*« Understood. »*

  
Back to the crystals. He placed each one down. The crystals had dense concentric ritual circles etched into their surfaces.

Reyana leaned over to inspect a crystal. ""What's this?""

Jin grinned. ""I'm sure by now if the cult, or rather the one running this operation, isn't a total dumbfuck, they would have by now concluded the destruction and looting of the outpost wasn't Matthew's, or rather the resistance's work.""

""My little Trojan horse hasn't been found yet, which means they didn't look too deeply into their own rituals. So what we need is to give them something else to find.""

He tapped the crystals. ""These are, well, sort of ritual suppression crystals. All we gotta do is plant them in the ritual circles.""

Reyana tossed one toward Joe. ""I've made better with him. If I poke this enough, I'll see through it.""

""That's the point."" Jin winked.

""Huh?""

""These are crafted decently enough to show whoever made them has some fundamental knowledge of rituals, enough to work around rituals, but nowhere near enough to actually figure out or tweak with the actual ritual circles of the cult.""

""They'll find these with some difficulty, yes, I'm sure about that."" Jin continued. ""They would also reverse the damage fast, but once they find we planted this in a lot of outposts, an image will 100% cement in their mind that we only know this much about rituals.""

Joe whistled. ""Ohhh, I like it.""

Rudy frowned. ""But… why? Our Trojan horse is planted, and nobody found it!""

Jin turned to face Rudy directly. ""That's sort of the problem, Rudy. Think about it. We hit their outpost fast and clean, which showed we are professionals, but wouldn't you find it weird that we looted the outpost completely? Down to the spare change in desk drawers, and we didn't find their ritual circles?""

Rudy's eyes widened. ""Ohhh.""

""Yeah, Rudy. We hit them too clean. They'll expect us to have found their ritual chambers. When they check, and everything looks normal, they'll get suspicious. Really suspicious. But if they find these..."" Jin lifted a crystal, light catching on the etched runes. ""They'll think they've caught our play. We gathered info on the ritual circles on our first strike and then, after some prep, tried to sabotage them.""

""Hmm, whatever gets the job done."" Jin set the crystal back down. ""What we're really after are the resources and time. Let them run in circles chasing the wrong threat.""

Reyana pointed at another symbol. ""What are the crosses for?""

""Operation Circle is us,"" Jin said. ""Operation Cross is Salvatore.""

""Figured."" Reyana sighed knowingly.

Rudy's head snapped up. ""Master's not coming with us?""

Annoyance flickered across Salvatore's face.

*Hehe. Leave it to Rudy and his dumb muscle brain to casually demand training from an*  
*Overlord like it's a gym membership.*

  
*« You should also be that shameless. Who knows, you might get that 'The Eternal One' to show up. »*

  
*Shut up!*  


""I have some other work on the surface,"" Salvatore said. His voice was flat, the kind of tone that meant the conversation was over before it started.

Rudy opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again like a fish gasping for air. ""But we're hitting cult strongholds. Wouldn't it be better if we had an Overlord backing us up?""

""No."" Salvatore's tone dropped ten degrees.

That shut Rudy up instantly.

Jin clapped his hands, grabbing the attention back as he gestured to Joe. ""Alright! Joe—gear.""

""Yup, one second."" Joe snapped his fingers, and a door slid a metal box onto the table.

""These are the gears we made,"" Jin said, opening the lid of his box.

He took the top pouch inside the box. Inside were sleek black earpieces.

Jin demonstrated by tapping one against his ear, where it stuck with a faint tingle of essence bonding.

He then slid a paper across the table with appraisal results written in his neat handwriting.

""This is an all-in-one charm,"" Jin said, holding one up. ""Think of it as Helldiver's Mark, but without the soul-binding contract.""

Joe bowed his head with an exaggerated flourish. ""Thanks to my masterful work, naturally.""

Everyone except Salvatore laughed. Even Reyana cracked a smile, though she tried to hide it behind her hand.

Jin fought his own grin and continued. ""This has three main functions.""

""One, shield. Absorbs damage up to your ORDER tier plus one. It's not invincible, but it'll keep you alive through most ambushes.""

""Two, emergency teleport. If an attack capable of overloading the shield in one hit comes at you, this'll yank you out. The range is up to you if you can react consciously. If not, it randomly drops you anywhere within a hundred-meter radius.""

""So we might end up in a wall?"" Rudy asked, genuine concern in his voice.

""It checks for solid matter,"" Joe interjected. ""You'll be fine. Probably.""

""Probably?""

""Ninety-eight percent chance of fine.""

Rudy muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like ""why am I not surprised,"" but Jin pretended not to hear it.

Jin tapped the badge with his finger. ""The third function is an emergency signal. Tap it with your essence, and Joe should be able to feel it through his Mantle. Part of his spatial concept is woven into these.""

Joe nodded, expression turning serious for once. ""I'll know the direction and approximate distance. Can't promise instant rescue if I'm in my own fight, but I'll know you're in trouble.""

""That's all for now. The rest of the items are mine and one-time-use trinkets."" Jin said, pulling the box into his spatial storage. ""Now, apart from this, we also have a lot of potions.""

Reyana opened the final box. Rows of vials gleamed inside, each one labeled in Jin's handwriting. The potions had taken most of the previous day to brew, but the quality was worth it.

""Healing, stamina, essence recovery, essence boost, berserker, mind calm, and a couple of special options."" Jin's grin turned sharp. ""Use at your discretion. Don't mix berserker with anything else unless you want your heart to explode. Reyana did the brewing. I just provided the pure bases.""

Salvatore took a healing vial, holding it up to the light. The liquid inside glowed with a soft golden radiance. ""Quality's good.""

""Reyana did most of the work,"" Jin said. ""I think my using Harvest might have pushed the quality higher.""

Salvatore nodded, genuine approval in his eyes.

""That's all there is."" Jin straightened. ""I've one last thing to do alone, and then we can be on our way.""

*Time to harvest an ORDER IV!*

# PART I: THE REARVIEW MIRROR

My name was Frank, and for forty-two years that name had been a heavy, rusted anchor dragging along the bottom of a life that never quite gained buoyancy, catching on every jagged rock of failure and disappointment until the chain finally snapped under the tension. Now, hurtling west at eighty-five miles an hour, I was watching that anchor recede in the rearview mirror, cutting the water of a life I no longer recognized, leaving a wake of destruction that I felt no desire to repair. I was not a good man, nor was I a particularly bad one until this morning; I was simply a man who had been compressed by the crushing weight of a mortgage that grew like a malignant tumor, a loveless marriage that had calcified into a silent, grinding resentment, and a job at the lumber yard that treated me like a spare part, a fleshy cog in a machine of wood and steel until the structural integrity of my sanity finally gave way. The Plymouth I drove was a physical manifestation of my existence. A 2004 sedan that was shaking itself apart, the suspension groaning over the Texas asphalt like a dying animal, the transmission slipping with a mechanical scream that mirrored the panic rising in my own throat. I was fleeing a crime scene that looked uncomfortably like my living room, leaving behind a woman who was probably still screaming into the phone I had ripped from the wall, and I was carrying fifty thousand dollars in cash that I had liberated from the wall safe we had installed together ten years ago. I was running on adrenaline and hatred, fueled by the terrifying liberation of having absolutely nothing left to lose, driving toward a horizon that shimmered with heat and the vague, desperate promise of oblivion in Mexico, where I imagined the tequila flowed like water and men like me could simply dissolve into the sand.

The morning had started with the usual quiet hostility, the silence in the kitchen thick enough to choke on, broken only by the aggressive clinking of spoons against cereal bowls and the hum of the refrigerator that sounded like a ticking bomb counting down to an explosion we both knew was coming. It was the credit card bill that struck the match; a piece of paper detailing purchases for a life we couldn't afford to live, a catalog of debts for happiness we never achieved, luxury items that sat gathering dust in corners while we ate generic cereal in a house we didn't own. The argument hadn't been an explosion at first; it was a slow leak, a hiss of accusations that we had both memorized years ago, a script we had performed a thousand times with minor variations. But then she laughed. It wasn't a joyful sound; it was a dry, dismissive bark that stripped me of whatever dignity I had left clinging to my bones. She looked at me with eyes that were no longer the eyes of the woman I married, but the eyes of a disappointed landlord evicting a tenant she had despised for years. That was when the vase flew. That was when the red mist descended, obscuring reason, obscuring consequence, leaving only the primal need to smash, to break, to hurt, to silence the laughter that echoed the laughter of my father, my bosses, and the world itself. I remembered the sensation of the safe's dial under my fingers. 32-15-08. Click. The door swung open, revealing the stacks of hundreds we had hoarded for a rainy day. Well, the storm had finally broken, and it was a hurricane that would wash us both away.

I kept my eyes fixed on the rearview mirror, scanning the heat haze for the telltale flashing lights of the State Troopers, my heart hammering a frantic, irregular rhythm against my ribs like a trapped bird beating its wings against a cage of bone. The interior of the car was a sweltering oven, the air conditioner having surrendered its ghost somewhere near the Pecos River with a final, dying rattle, and now the vents merely recirculated the dust and the oppressive heat of the Chihuahuan Desert, blowing it into my face like the breath of a sickly animal. My shirt, a cheap polyester blend that I had worn for three consecutive days of planning and drinking, was plastered to my spine with a cold, greasy sweat that smelled of fear and cheap whiskey, a scent that seemed to be oozing from my pores, turning the cabin into a locker room of despair. Every vibration of the steering wheel traveled up my arms, rattling the bones in my forearms and settling as a dull, throbbing ache in the base of my skull. I was piloting a wreck. I was a fugitive in a dying machine, pushing us both beyond our limits, desperate to put enough miles between myself and the wreckage of my past before the inevitable collapse caught up with us.

I reached for the pack of Camels on the dashboard, my hand trembling with a fine, neurological shutter that made it difficult to grasp the cardboard box, only to find it empty, crushed and useless, a testament to the chain-smoking nervous breakdown I had been experiencing since dawn. I crumpled the pack in a fist that felt weak and distant, throwing it into the backseat where it joined a sordid collection of empty Red Bull cans, plastic water bottles twisted into crinkling shapes of dehydration, and fast-food wrappers that rustled like dry autumn leaves every time the tires hit a pothole. The need for nicotine was a physical hunger, a sharp claw digging into my lungs, but it was secondary to the need to keep moving, to keep the wheels turning against the asphalt. I grabbed my phone from the cup holder, noting the single bar of signal and the blinking red battery icon that pulsed like a dying heart, and I dialed the number not because I wanted to apologize, but because I needed to sever the last thread, to burn the bridge while I was still standing on it, to ensure that there was no road leading back to the life I was vaporizing.

""You son of a bitch-"" She hissed immediately, her voice distorted by the poor connection and the sheer volume of her rage, a sound that I had lived with for fifteen years but which now sounded like a transmission from a different planet, alien and hostile. ""I called the cops, Frank. They’re looking for the car. They know about the Plymouth. They know about the plates. You think you can just take the money and run? You think you’re smart enough to disappear? You’re a loser, Frank. You’ve always been a loser. Even your escape is going to be a failure. You'll run out of gas, or you'll get lost, or you'll just give up because that's what you do. You crumble.""

""I took what was mine, Lorraine!"" I shouted back, my voice raw and cracking, fighting to be heard over the roar of the wind rushing through the open windows and the screaming engine that sounded like it was tearing itself apart. ""I earned every cent in that safe while you sat on the couch and told me I wasn't enough. I broke my back at the yard for ten years, eating sawdust and taking orders from kids half my age, just to buy you things you didn't even like. I'm done. I'm finished. The bank can have the house. The cops can have the car. But I'm taking the cash, and I'm taking my life back.""

The memory of the morning flashed through my mind with sickening clarity. The argument over the credit card bill, the vase flying past my head and shattering against the drywall, sending ceramic shrapnel across the beige carpet like shrapnel from a grenade. I saw the way her face twisted into a mask of pure, unadulterated loathing that made her look like a stranger, a monster wearing my wife's skin. I remembered the shove, the way she stumbled back, her hip catching the edge of the heavy oak coffee table with a sickening thud, and the silence that followed, a heavy, suffocating silence that was louder than the screaming. I didn't wait to see if she got up; I didn't check for a pulse. I went straight for the safe, my hands moving with a calm, robotic precision that terrified me in retrospect, entering the combination as if I were punching in the launch codes for a nuclear missile. Now, staring at the road ahead, I felt a surge of justification mixed with a nauseating wave of guilt, a cocktail of emotions that made my stomach churn and bile rise in my throat, burning like acid.

""You hit me!"" She screamed, the signal breaking up into jagged shards of digital noise. ""You... Pussy... I’m bleeding... Frank... They'll kill you... They will shoot you down like a dog in the street...""

""I'm already dead!"" I screamed back, slamming the phone against the steering wheel before throwing it onto the passenger seat, watching it bounce off the stained upholstery. ""I died five years ago! You just didn't notice the smell! You just kept walking over the corpse in the hallway!""

I passed a hitchhiker near the on-ramp, a scrawny kid in a dirty flannel shirt, thumb out, looking hopeful in that pathetic way that makes you hate the world a little more. He looked like he had been standing there for a hundred years, coated in the dust of the highway. I didn't even tap the brakes. I accelerated, letting the dust swirl over him, feeling a satisfaction at leaving someone else stranded in the dirt. ""Get a job…"" I muttered, the words tasting like ash. ""Walk to hell for all I care. Nobody stops for me, kid. Nobody ever stopped for me.""

I needed gas, and I needed it soon, as the needle on the fuel gauge was hovering dangerously close to the empty mark, dipping into the red zone every time the car banked around a curve. I spotted a sign rising out of the heat haze, a rusted metal rectangle that promised *LAST STOP 50 MILES*, and I took the exit with reckless speed, the tires squealing in protest. The gas station was a desolate outpost, a concrete bunker squatting under the relentless sun. I pulled up to the pump, the heat hitting me like a physical blow the moment I opened the door.

I walked inside the station, the bell above the door jangling with a lonely, irritated sound, and faced a clerk who looked like he had been grown in a vat of grease and apathy. He was a kid with angry acne and eyes that were glazed over with boredom or drugs, watching a portable TV with a hypnotic intensity. I slapped a twenty-dollar bill on the counter, demanding pump two, and he looked at me with the dead, shark-like eyes of someone who had seen every variety of desperation the highway had to offer. I felt a surge of violent rage, a desire to reach across the counter and smash his face into the register, but I swallowed it down, forcing myself to be just another customer. I pumped the gas with shaking hands, the fumes making me dizzy, and bought a pack of cigarettes with the change, ripping the plastic off with my teeth before I was even back in the car.

I peeled out of the station, the gravel spraying out behind the Plymouth like buckshot, hitting the metal sign with a satisfying *ping-ping-ping*, and merged back onto the highway. The smoke from my first cigarette filled the cabin, coating my throat with familiar tar and calming the tremors in my hands. The dashboard clock read **6:45 PM**, and the sun was beginning its long, slow descent toward the horizon, a bloated orange sphere that hung heavy in the sky, glaring at me like an accusatory eye. I was heading west, chasing the sun, trying to outrun the night.

# PART II: THE GOLDEN TRAP

The transition was subtle at first, a gradual shifting of the light that turned the bleached, bone-white landscape into a shimmering tableau of gold and bronze. It was the Golden Hour, that fleeting window of time when the world looks perfectly lit, but out here in the desolation, it felt aggressive, the light thick and syrupy, coating the windshield and making the cactus spines glow like filaments in a lightbulb. I dropped the visor to shield my eyes, but the glare was relentless, bouncing off the hood of the car and searing into my retinas. I turned on the radio to drown out the silence, scanning through the static until I found a station playing a loop of classic rock, the guitars and drums sounding tinny and distant, like they were being broadcast from the bottom of a well.

I drove for what felt like hours, the landscape unspooling in a repetitive loop of mesa, cactus, and cracked asphalt. My body began to protest the confinement, my lower back screaming in agony, my legs cramping. My bladder filled with a dull, insistent ache that grew sharper with every mile. I reached for the bottle of water I had bought hours ago, only to find it empty, offering nothing but the memory of water. The dryness in the car was absolute; it felt as though the air itself was rasping against my skin, turning my lips into parchment.

I glanced at the dashboard clock. The digital display glowed with a steady, mocking green light: **7:03 PM**. I frowned, shaking my head as if to clear a cobweb. I checked my wristwatch, a cheap Timex, and saw the second hand ticking rhythmically, but the minute hand was frozen on the three.

Panic, cold and sharp, began to prick at the back of my neck. I looked at the sun, expecting it to be lower, but it hung there, suspended in the amber sky, exactly where it had been hours ago. It was a fixed point, an unblinking eye that refused to close. The radio station ended the track and then, after a brief crackle of static, began playing the same song again, looping seamlessly back into the same three minutes of audio.

""Just keep driving."" As I drove, the car felt heavier. The suspension groaned, bottoming out over bumps that shouldn't have been there. It felt like I was carrying a load of wet cement. Then, I smelled it. Not the stale cigarette smoke, not the rotting burger, but something sharp and chemical. Unwashed hair. Stale onion chips. 

I looked in the rearview mirror.

My heart seized, skipping a beat and then stuttering into a gallop.

There was someone in the back seat.

It was the hitchhiker I had passed on the ramp. The scrawny kid in the flannel shirt. He was sitting right in the middle of the bench seat, staring straight ahead through the windshield, his hands resting politely on his knees. He looked bored, like he was waiting for a bus.

""Who the hell are you?"" I shouted, swerving the car, the tires screeching as I fought for control. ""How did you get in here?""

The kid didn't answer immediately. He leaned forward, squinting at the road ahead. ""You think we'll make Albuquerque by sundown?"" He asked. His voice was casual, dusty, as if we had been talking for hours. ""My mom's gonna kill me if I'm late.""

""I didn't pick you up!"" I screamed, reaching back with one hand to grab him, to shove him, to do anything to prove he wasn't real.

My hand passed through cold air. I felt a resistance, like moving through thick gelatin, but my fingers closed on nothing but the empty upholstery. I snapped my hand back, cradling it against my chest. It felt numb, frostbitten.

I looked in the mirror again. He was still there, looking confused by my outburst.

""Relax, mister."" The kid said, picking at a loose thread on his jeans. ""Thanks for the ride, by the way. Most people just drive right past.""

""I did drive past!"" I yelled. ""I left you on the ramp!""

""Nah-"" the kid smiled, but the smile didn't reach his eyes. ""You stopped. Everybody stops eventually. Can I change the station? This song loops too much.""

I blinked, squeezing my eyes shut for a terrifying second while doing ninety miles an hour. When I opened them, the back seat was empty. The cold was gone, replaced instantly by the suffocating heat. The smell of onions vanished, leaving only the smell of my own fear. But the impression of his weight remained on the suspension, a ghostly ballast dragging me down.

I was trapped in a cage, a prisoner of 7:03 PM. My body continued to metabolize, to thirst, to ache. I was forced to engage in the humiliating act of relieving myself into an empty Gatorade bottle while driving at ninety. The smell of hot piss filled the cabin. I capped the bottle and threw it into the back seat.

# PART III: THE PACER

It was in the depth of this delirium, when the sun seemed to be drilling a hole through my skull, that I noticed the anomaly in the rearview mirror. A gray sedan, utterly nondescript, sitting perfectly in my blind spot. It had simply appeared, manifesting out of the heat haze like a ghost ship.

""Where the hell did you come from?"" I rasped.

I sped up. The gray sedan matched the acceleration instantly. I slammed on the brakes. The sedan slowed in perfect unison. It was tethered to me.

I drifted toward its lane, shouting obscure threats. The sedan didn't flinch. As I got closer, I felt that if I touched it, the universe would shatter.

Then, a heavy sigh came from the passenger seat.

I jumped, the car swerving. I looked over.

A man was sitting there. He was wearing a cheap, ill-fitting suit that was stained with sweat at the armpits and collar. He had a sample case on his lap and was wiping his forehead with a handkerchief that was already gray with grime. He looked like every door-to-door salesman who had ever tried to sell me insurance I couldn't afford.

""Hot enough for you?"" He asked, chuckling humorlessly. He loosened his tie. ""Christ, the AC in this thing is busted, huh? I told my boss, I said, 'Send me to Arizona,' I said. 'At least it's a dry heat.' But this? This is biblical.""

""Who are you?"" I whispered, my voice trembling.

""Name's Miller-"" He said, extending a hand that I refused to shake. He didn't seem offended; he just started organizing papers in his briefcase. ""Look, I know we're in a rush, but I really need to make this quota. The numbers, Frank. The numbers are killing me.""

""How do you know my name?""

""We're all numbers, Frank."" Miller said, looking at his watch. ""You, me, the debt. It all adds up eventually. I'm late, you know? I'm terribly late. If I don't close this deal, they're gonna terminate me. And you know what termination means out here.""

""Get out-"" I said. ""I'm not buying anything.""

""Oh, you already bought it."" Miller said, looking out the window at the endless desert. ""You bought the whole package. The house, the car, the lie. High interest rates, Frank. compounding daily."" He turned to me, his face suddenly serious, stripped of the salesman's veneer. ""Did you think you could just cancel the contract?""

I looked back at the road for a split second to avoid a pothole. When I looked back, the seat was empty. A single business card fluttered on the vinyl seat for a moment before dissolving into dust.

I gripped the wheel, hyperventilating. ""Just hallucinations."" I chanted. ""Just the heat.""

""You really should watch your blood pressure, dear.""

The voice came from the back seat. Soft, warbling, kind.

I looked in the mirror. An old woman was sitting there now. She had silver hair done up in a tight bun and was wearing a floral dress that looked like upholstery from the 1950s. She was knitting something long and gray, her needles clicking rhythmically.

""Grandma?"" I asked, the word slipping out before I could stop it. She looked exactly like my grandmother, or maybe everyone's grandmother.

""Here."" She said, leaning forward. She held out a hard candy wrapped in strawberry cellophane. ""You look peaky. Low blood sugar makes a man cranky.""

""I didn't pick you up…"" I said, but my voice lacked conviction now. I was too tired to fight.

""Of course you did."" she said soothingly. ""You're a good boy, Frank. You always stop for folks. Remember when you helped that turtle off the road when you were seven?""

""I... I remember.""

""See? A good heart."" She went back to her knitting. The needles clicked like a ticking clock. ""It's a shame about the mess, though. You really made a mess of things, didn't you?""

""I didn't mean to…"" I whispered.

""We never do."" She hummed. ""But you can't knit a sweater without a pattern, and you've been dropping stitches for years. Now, keep your eyes on the road. We're almost to the drop-off.""

I blinked to clear the sweat from my eyes. The clicking stopped. The back seat was empty. But the smell of strawberry candy and mothballs lingered, sweet and cloying.

Then, the passenger door lock popped up with a cheerful plastic sound.

I stared at it, my brain freezing. The heavy, rusted door swung open slightly against the wind, then slammed shut.

She was sitting there.

Lorraine.

She was wearing the same bathrobe she had been wearing this morning. The pink one with the coffee stain on the lapel. But now, the robe was dark with moisture. A deep, spreading red stain started at her temple and soaked down into the fabric.

""Lorraine?"" I choked out.

She didn't look at me. She was staring out the side window at the gray sedan. She looked bored. She looked annoyed. She reached out and adjusted the air vent, her fingers leaving bloody smudges on the plastic slats.

""You're driving too fast, Frank."" She said. Her voice was conversational, completely at odds with the trauma on her face. ""You always drive too fast when you're angry. It's childish.""

""You're not here…"" I said, tears streaming down my face.

""You never leave anything, Frank."" She sighed, a wet, bubbling sound. ""You just drag it with you. That's your problem. You're a hoarder.""

""I'm sorry-"" I sobbed. ""I didn't mean to. I just wanted you to stop laughing.""

She turned to look at me. The left side of her face was a ruin, but the right eye was clear and sharp. ""I'm not laughing now, am I?"" She reached out and touched my arm. Her hand was heavy and burning hot. I screamed and jerked the wheel. The gray sedan swerved with me.

""Stop it!"" I shrieked. ""Get out of my car!""

""It's not your car, Frank."" She said softly.

I looked back at the road. When I looked back at the passenger seat, she was gone. But the bloodstain remained on the fabric. The reprieve was short. A moment later, the smell of cheap cigars and Old Spice filled the cabin. I looked over, and my father was sitting in the passenger seat. He was wearing his Sunday suit.

""You're gripping the wheel too tight, boy."" He rumbled. ""Just like you white-knuckled your whole life.""

""Dad?"" I whispered. ""You're dead.""

""And you're stupid."" He countered. ""Always were. I told you that girl was trouble. You think you can outrun what you did? That gray car is the repo man, son. And he's come for the only thing you have left.""

I blinked, and he was gone. But the smell of cigar smoke lingered.

I spent hours, or perhaps days, in this deadlock. The passengers cycled through, a carousel of judgment. The gas station clerk appeared in the back seat, holding his own head, mouthing *Pump two*. The psychological torture was worse than the heat. I was a madman in a rolling oven, arguing with phantoms. The only thing that changed was the fuel gauge. While the clock remained frozen at **7:03 PM**, the fuel needle continued its inexorable slide toward empty.

""Gas."" I croaked. ""It has to end when the gas runs out.""

The engine began to sputter. The car bucked, losing power. I fought to guide the dying beast onto the shoulder. The Plymouth rolled to a halt, a dead thing in a dead world. I slumped over the wheel, gasping for breath.

I looked in the side mirror. The gray sedan had stopped behind me. Its engine was off.

# PART IV: THE END OF THE ROAD

I sat in the suffocating silence of the dead car. The heat began to rise instantly. I had to get out. I pushed the door open, the hinges shrieking, and swung my legs out onto the asphalt.

My muscles had seized up. I stood, swaying, and looked back at the gray sedan. It was parked twenty feet behind me, looking impossibly clean.

Then, I turned and looked at my own car.

My brain stalled. It was the Plymouth, yes. But it wasn't the car I had just stepped out of.

The front end was demolished, crushed accordion-style. The hood was crumpled. The radiator was steaming. The windshield was shattered, a spiderweb of opaque glass radiating from a violent impact point on the driver's side, stained with blood.

I walked toward the wreckage. I approached the driver's side window and looked inside. The steering wheel was bent in half. And there, slumped over the ruin of the controls, was a man.

He was pinned by the dashboard. His head was twisted at an impossible angle. His face was a mask of trauma. But I recognized the shirt. I recognized the watch.

It was me.

I stared at my own corpse, and the horror I expected didn't come. Instead, a wave of profound, dull understanding washed over me. The memories slotted into place. The exit ramp ten miles from my house. The tire blowout. The concrete abutment. The impact.

I hadn't made it to the desert. I hadn't made it to the border. I had died hours ago. The drive, the heat, the hitchhikers. It was all just the echo of a dying brain, the final firing of synapses in a skull that was already broken.

I looked down at my hands. They were clean. The blood was gone. My skin felt cool, detached. I looked back at the corpse in the car. It looked pathetic. It was just a broken thing that didn't matter anymore.

I looked at the passenger seat of the wrecked car. It was empty. There was no blood on the upholstery. No fingerprints on the vent. Lorraine wasn't there. She was alive, back in the house, probably crying, probably hating me, but alive. I hadn't killed her. I had only killed myself. The guilt had been the only hitchhiker that mattered.

Behind me, the door of the gray sedan clicked open.

I turned. The interior light of the sedan was on, casting a cool, blue glow. I walked toward it. The interior was immaculate. Gray leather. New Car scent.

The keys were in the ignition.

I slid into the driver's seat. It was comfortable. I closed the door, sealing out the desert. I turned the key. The engine purred to life.

I put the car in drive and pulled out onto the road, bypassing the smoking wreck of the Plymouth. As I accelerated, the sun finally began to move. It dipped below the edge of the world, extinguishing the golden fire. The sky turned a deep, bruised purple, then black. I turned on the headlights, cutting a clean path through the darkness, and drove west, into the endless night.

# EPILOGUE

But the darkness wasn't empty. It wasn't the flat, suffocating black of a closed closet or a grave. As the last sliver of the angry sun vanished, the night that replaced it felt heavy, velvet, and pregnant with something waiting to be born. The headlights of the gray sedan didn't just illuminate the road, they began to unravel it. The twin beams of white light pierced the gloom, and where they touched the asphalt, the world began to change.

The black sky above, which I had expected to be scattered with the cold, indifferent stars of the desert, began to tear. It wasn't a violent ripping, but a gentle parting, like curtains being drawn back on a stage of infinite proportion. A rift of light appeared, not golden or searing like the sun I had fled, but a color I had never seen. A deep, resonant violet. It was the color of a bruised plum, but brighter.

The horizon line, once a prison of flat earth and heat haze, began to fracture. Great spires of crystalline light erupted from the ground, towering structures of geometry that defied gravity, pulsing with soft, bioluminescent blues and greens. They weren't buildings, they were thoughts, memories of a world that hadn't been broken yet. The gray sedan, the vessel of my transition, began to lose its solidity. The steering wheel under my hands softened, dissolving into a mist of silver light that coated my fingers like cool mercury. The dashboard melted away, revealing not the engine, but a vast, sprawling nebula of swirling stardust that rushed toward me.

I felt a sensation of weightlessness, the heavy, rusted anchor of forty-two years finally disintegrating into dust. The sky above sundered completely, peeling back to reveal an expanse of impossible beauty. Nebulas of gold and teal swirled in a cosmic dance, and moons, three of them, massive and pearlescent, hung low in the sky, watching me with benevolence. I wasn't driving anymore. I was soaring. The road had lifted from the earth, becoming a ribbon of pure light that wound its way up into the stars.

I looked down at my hands. They were no longer the hands of a man who had failed. They were luminous, woven from the same starlight that filled the sky. I looked back, one last time, into the rearview mirror. There was no wreck. There was no Plymouth. There was no desert. There was only a fading pinpoint of orange light, a dying ember of a hell I had extinguished.

A laugh bubbled up in my throat, but this time, it wasn't jagged or hysterical. It was pure. It was the sound of a bell ringing in a clear morning. It was the sound of freedom. For the first time in forty-two years, the silence wasn't waiting to judge me. It was waiting to welcome me. I turned back to the light, pressed my foot down on a pedal that was no longer there, and accelerated into the embrace of the infinite.

Today, a random grandmother has paid for mine and my children’s meals.","A positive post this time- absolutely restoring my faith in humanity. 

It’s been snowing by us today. My kids (4 & 3) were eager to get outside. So we went for a walk to the playground and fields. After playing, they moaned they were hungry. We weren’t far from home so I said let’s go home. 

They moaned they wanted to go to the cafe. I said, “you know what kids. What a lovely idea, let’s do that.” But told my youngest he would have to behave- and he said he would. 

The cafe and its staff are so inviting. I love going there with and without the kids. My youngest isn’t great out, so I tend not to do it much with him. 

An old lady was sat on her own, talking to me about her children and grandchildren and asking about mine. I was reading a story to them and colouring with them, whilst we waited for food. 

My 3 year old said, “I can’t wait for my food. I am starving”. We all laughed at how adorable he was being. 

Then food came. He got up from his seat and I shot up and said, “oh no, you can sit back down and eat”. 
“I don’t want to eat I’m not hungry”. Back and forth us goading one another. My poor daughter is just you know, sat eating away. 

He was throwing food on the floor and as if there were a God shining a beam of light on us, by some miracle, something I said or did got him to stop, and he started eating and said, “oh yes this is yummy”. 🙃

I’d apologised to the old lady, for just cutting our conversation off and just ignoring her, but she gave me that smile that told me she understood. 

She went to leave and we all said goodbye to her and to have a wonderful new year. I said, “don’t worry, their dad is picking them up at 1 from here, to take them to his house for the weekend, so I will get my break 😅”. She told me don’t party too hard 😆. 

As I was waiting for their dad to pick them up, I got my 3 year old to help me clean up the floor, I finished my coffee and read another story to the kids, from the cafe bookshelf/toy shelf, which they were calm for. The waitress kept smiling and circling round and I said, “oh yes sorry can I have my bill now? We have to get going soon. Wasn’t meaning to ignore you”. 

She said with a huge grin, “it’s already been paid.” I thought, “I know I’m a scatter brain, but I’m not that bad that I’d forgot I’d already paid”. 

I said, “I’m confused” and the waitress said, “she didn’t want me to tell you who it was, but it was the lady sitting here”. 

That was about £35 worth of food and drinks for the 3 of us! I shed a tear and said, “that’s one of the kindest things anyone has done for me”. The waitress said, “it’s not even my bill, and it’s really made my day too. Just someone being kind to others, just makes you feel so uplifted”. 

I have had my fair share of horrible people in my life and had people treat me and others I know like rubbish. I have been shocked in my time on this planet, at the cruelty of people. Something in my soul tells me to just keep persevering- there are plenty of good people and good acts to counteract the bad. This lady has reminded me of the good in life and society, with just this act of kindness. And of course, I let my children know, just how kind this lady had been to our family, because I want to highlight to my kids, just how kind the world can be.  

It does now mean I’m going to have to pay it back, as I feel it in my bones I have to- so if you want to make a beeline for me, here I am. 🤣",10,1767367962.0,UKParenting,1,1.0,False
1q21lf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q21lf7,November 2025 bride,"We were supposed to get married last November 10, 2025 sa tagaytay. Pero of all days sa pilipinas, ito yung araw na ramdam na ramdam si Bagyong Uwan sa Region IV. Haha iyak malala since we really took the risk of having a garden wedding from ceremony to reception! Yes, as in walang bubong! Haha that's the theme. Skl, November 07 nung nag bibigay ng mas clear na forecast ang PAG ASA sa weather and yes somehow accurate ang accuweather, we took another risk of moving all suppliers to November 12, 2025. Just 2 days after november 10. A lot of our family and friends are saying it's impossible. Meron at merong papalya. But who would have thought na in just 2 hrs of contacing everyone, then all our guest, na move ang buong wedding!! 😭😭 Hay, thank you Lord! Lahat ng wedding na kasabay namin that week eh nag cancel na and move na daw next year. 

Anyway, sharing the happiest and by far most memorable moment of my life! Huhu

Lessons learned: 

1. Super risky mag outdoor wedding. Gets ko na why others opted for indoor talaga at least sa receptions. Nakaka anxiety. 

2. May pros ang weekday wedding. It's a monday dapat moved on wednesday. Mas madali mag move and mas madami available on those days for our guests? 

Sharing our photos and suppliers 🙈

My question is this: since I had such a strong reaction the first time, should I split my first tirzepatide dose in half?

1q21ju4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q21ju4,My Year End Rajasthan Trip,"Hello Wonderful people of reddit,

Did a short solo Rajasthan trip (Gurgaon — Jaipur  — Pushkar — Udaipur —Gurgaon). 

This was a very impulsive trip. Decided around 9pm  and took a bus at 12 on 25th. Planned everything on fly. 

1. Jaipur
- Saw sunrise at Jal Mahal
- Went to Amber Fort
- Came back to hostel took some rest
- In the early evening, went to Hawa Mahal, City Palace and Albert Hall
- Had Rawat ki Pyaz Kachori and Mawa Kachori

Left for Ajmer the very next morning. Then, to Pushkar from there.

2. Pushkar
- Fun Crazy Experience at Hostel
- Walked around Pushkar Lake
- Went to Lake view cafe, Saw sunset.
- Went to Brahma Mandir, was very crowded. So, just went to one of the ghats and played dhol for an hour and half with 4 other random people 
- Took a late night bus from Ajmer to Udaipur

3. Udaipur
‐ Reached early morning, went to Fateh Sagar, walked all of it.
- Then, went to Ambrai Ghat and found a very special human (recited some of my poetry to her from my book).
- Went to Hostel (near Ganghor Ghat), took some good rest and chilled around Pichola Lake. Walked around the market in the evening and went for a coffee with the person I met early in the morning
- Next day, early in the morning, went to Jagdish Temple.Then, to City Palace, then Boat ride. Spent around 5-6 hours here. Chilling.
- Had Rajasthani Thali from Natarajan and then left for bus stand and took my bus for Gurgaon.


Do let me know what else I could have covered.  Maybe next time around, I can manage that.

Yoosung:- (hachiware)

I know most people will pick him as chiikawa because he has low self esteem and a bit of a scaredy cat 
but I see him alot like Hachiware because he is very cheerful, friendly and goes out of his way to cheer up people and help them.
 And yoosung is actually very smart and perceptive of others feelings. He also is very selfless much to his own detriment. 

Zen:- (Rakko)

Tough guy who can fight and is admired by everyone and has a fan following. But deep down he is a softie.

Seven:- (Usagi)

Playful guy who loves to tease others but is one of the most competent ones out there who is also a bit mysterious. For both seven and usagi their playful personality is a facade to hide a much more calculative personality. Also both of them are the most popular characters in the series/game

Jumin:- (Kurimanju)

Both are alcoholics. Jumin crashed a car when he was drunk and Kurimanju lost his license for drinking too much.

Jaehee:- (Shisa)

 Both of them are very hardworking and strive to be the better version of themselves. They both also share interest in some kind of culinary art- jaehee with coffee shisa with okinawan food.

Saeran:- Ray(Chiikawa) Unknown(Momonga)

I think ray fits chiikawa better than yoosung because ray also has low self esteem and sees himself weak but he is alot more introverted than yoosung is. Unknown is Momonga because they both are a bit evil and always are planning something up their sleeves

Jihyun:- (Kani)

Both are chill guys. Arent quite prominent in the story (until much later). Jihyun seems like a guy who would run a bookstore

That black [bamboo charcoal toothpaste](https://toothpastefactory.com/) that's all over TikTok and Instagram? Yeah, it's still huge in 2026, and a ton of it comes out of Guangzhou, China.

If you're curious about trying it, sourcing it, or even private-labeling your own brand, I put together this casual guide based on what's happening right now. No hard sell, just sharing what I've figured out.

# what even is this stuff?

It's basically toothpaste gone goth: jet-black from activated bamboo charcoal. The charcoal is super porous, so it ""adsorbs"" (not absorbs—science nerds, you know the difference) surface stains, plaque bits, and odor-causing junk. Most formulas mix it with gentler ingredients like xylitol, mint, or herbal extracts. A lot are fluoride-free and vegan, which is why clean beauty fans love them.

Does it actually whiten? It helps with coffee/wine/red wine stains over time, but it's no replacement for professional whitening. Dentists are mixed—some say it's fine in moderation, others worry about abrasiveness if you go too hard.

[bamboo charcoal toothpaste factory](https://preview.redd.it/rt59hfvhdyag1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25348f55f0b5a9144423af1643fd716abfbb59da)

# Why Guangzhou though?

Guangzhou (especially districts like Baiyun) is straight-up the global hub for this kind of manufacturing. You've got modern factories with easy access to ports, raw bamboo charcoal supply chains, and workers who specialize in cosmetics/oral care. Tons of places are GMP-certified, some FDA-registered for U.S. exports, and they're pros at OEM/private label—meaning they'll make your custom formula and slap your branding on it.

# Quick peek inside the process

They start with high-quality activated bamboo charcoal powder (super fine and porous). Then mix it with the base (glycerin/sorbitol), flavors, and extras. Everything gets blended in big high-shear mixers, tested in labs for safety/pH/microbes, and filled into tubes on automated lines. Sustainability is trending too—more recycled packaging and responsibly sourced bamboo.

# If you're thinking about sourcing...

Here I recommend a manufacturer endorsed by industry partners: [**Guangzhou Toothpaste Factory**](https://toothpastefactory.com/). I verified their certifications (GMP and ISO 22716 are basic requirements) and inquired about minimum order quantities, which are negotiable. Communication via WeChat/English customer service is now seamless. Shipping from Guangzhou Port is reliable—just be mindful of tariffs and relevant regulations.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. If you're into natural skincare/oral care, what's your go-to product right now?

# Why ""Notta.ai-en"" and Regional Codes Matter

You might notice some keywords like **notta.ai-en coupon codes**. This refers to the English version of the site. Notta is a global company with a strong presence in Asia and the West. Ensuring you are using the correct regional site (Notta.ai-en) ensures that your **promo code** is valid for your currency, specifically for **Notta US promo codes**.

Using a code meant for the Japanese market on the US site might result in an error. Always ensure you are using a **verified notta** link to land on the correct checkout page for your region.

# The Value of ""Verified"" Codes

The internet is littered with expired coupons. We have all been there: you find a site promising a 50% **discount**, only to find the code is invalid. This is why looking for **verified** codes is crucial. A **verified** code means it has been tested and confirmed to work.

When you click our link, you are directed to a source that prioritizes accuracy. We understand that when you are searching for a **Notta Discount Code Notta**, you want it to work immediately.

# Detailed Feature Breakdown

To help you understand why using a **code** to upgrade is worth it, let's look closer at the features locked behind the paywall.

# Speaker Identification

In a meeting with five people, knowing *who* said *what* is vital. Notta automatically distinguishes between speakers. This is a feature often limited in free versions of software. By using **promo codes** to upgrade, you ensure your transcripts are clean and attributed correctly.

# Export Options

A transcript stuck in an app isn't very useful. You need to move that text to Word, Notion, or Slack. Paid plans allow for flexible export options. If you are serious about your workflow, you need these capabilities. A **discount code** makes accessing these necessary tools cheaper.

# Custom Vocabulary

Every industry has jargon. Whether you are in medicine, law, or engineering, Notta allows you to add custom vocabulary to improve transcription accuracy. This is a Pro feature that justifies the hunt for **Notta promo code** offers.

# FAQ: Notta Promo Codes and Coupons

**Q: Where can I find the latest Notta AI promo codes?** A: You can find the most recent and **verified** codes by visiting our recommended link. We update our list to ensure you get the best deal.

**Q: Do these codes work for Business plans?** A: Yes, many **discount codes** apply to both Pro and **Business plans**. Read the terms of the specific **coupon** to be sure.

**Q: Are there Notta coupons for students?** A: Notta often provides educational discounts. However, using a standard **promo code** is often the fastest way to secure a discount without needing to verify academic status.

**Q: Can I use a code for monthly billing?** A: Most **promo codes** offer the best value on annual plans, but some **monthly** discounts do exist. Check the details when you apply the **code**.

**Q: What if the code doesn't work?** A: Ensure you are using a **verified notta** code and that it hasn't expired. Our link is a great place to start for active offers.

# Maximizing Your Savings

To get the most out of your **Notta promo**, consider billing cycles. Annual plans usually come with a built-in discount (often 40-50% off compared to monthly). If you stack a **promo code** on top of an annual plan, your savings multiply.

For example, if the annual plan is already discounted, and you add a **Notta coupon** for an extra 10% or 20% off, you are getting enterprise-grade software for the price of a few coffees.

# The ""December"" and ""November"" Trend

If you are searching for **december** or **Notta coupons November**, you are likely looking for holiday leftovers. While those specific dates have passed, the ""New Year"" sales in January often mirror these deep discounts. Don't let the month on the calendar stop you; the **notta promo code** ecosystem is active year-round.

# Conclusion

In 2026, efficiency is the currency of success. Notta AI provides the technology you need to stay ahead, capturing every word so you can focus on the big picture. But efficiency shouldn't cost a fortune.

By utilizing **Notta promo codes**, **discount codes**, and **coupons**, you can unlock the full power of this **AI note-taker** without straining your budget. Whether you are an individual looking for a **Pro plan** or a manager seeking **Business plans**, there is a deal waiting for you.

Back in April I had a cholecystectomy and I'm introducing fats back into my diet (Christmas helped 😂). Pre health issues I was around 7st 7lb (105 pounds), I dropped down to 7 stone 1lb (99 pounds) after cholecystitis knocked me on my ass for a month. Then I gained weight to 7 stone 3/4lb (101/2 pounds) and since May sort of time that's where I have stayed! I'm 5ft 3 or 4in (like 64 inches)

I'm UK based and looking for recommendations for drunk supplements I can take to help me gain weight - brand recommendations and flavours. I was thinking complan? But don't want to waste money on something that taste horrible 

I get up at 5.30am for work, usually have a few Weetabix and honey or some quick porridge with an apple before starting work at 6am. I work 8 hours and have 30 mins break so I then I have a 15 min at work and usually have some sort of tuna or prawn salad or a sandwich and some snacks like hummus and breadsticks then I'll have another 15 mins about 3 hours later and have a snack like some fruit, sweets, some more dips and breadsticks. Then I get clock off at 2ish and I'll usually have egg and cheese bap or peanut butter sandwich, something along those line and then obviously dinner and then a snack/dessert after

So I'm looking to introduce some sort of liquid calories into my diet, mainly in the morning when I'm at work. I have my coffee but was thinking about adding a drink after my morning coffee and before my break

Also any help with gaining weight through gaining muscle is appreciated, I have no idea where to start 😅 I don't have access (or time) to go gym but I'll happily make 30 mins or so a day to workout if that helps.

1q21c9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/micro_saas/comments/1q21c9o/2_testflight_installs_both_dropped_during/,"2 TestFlight Installs, Both Dropped During Onboarding. Time to Address the Thing I Knew Might Be a Problem","I built **Pfynn** to solve a problem I'd had for years: drowning in financial data with minimal clarity. Apps like YNAB and Monarch Money left me anxious rather than informed. So I resorted to Google Sheets and crafted a workflow that actually worked, one that produced calm instead of stress.

My system boils down to two numbers: *This Month's Leftover* and *Next Month's Projection*.

The thinking is simple: I don't need to know what category each coffee falls into or whether Netflix is entertainment or a subscription. What I need to know is: after I pay all my obligations, account for my savings plans, and cover my credit card statements, what's left? That leftover is money I can use however I want. The second number projects the same calculation for next month, accounting for credit card cycles and *This Month's Leftover* (a rollover affect many apps miss).

I launched Pfynn into [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/htUHss2A) two weeks ago. I've had 2 installs and 5 sessions total. Both users dropped off during onboarding.

Here's the thing: I suspected this might happen.

One of the biggest hurdles for Pfynn is that the onboarding flow asks users to define their obligations up front. No recommendations, no reference points, just ""what are your monthly commitments?"" That's a big ask for someone who's never thought about their finances this way.

I knew this could be an issue. But I didn't want to over-engineer solutions for a problem that might not matter if the core idea didn't resonate. So I put it on the back burner and shipped the MVP.

Now, with this data, it feels like it's worth addressing. I have solutions in mind (templated obligation suggestions, Plaid transaction analysis to pre-populate common bills, a more guided first-time experience, etc.), but I'm trying to balance solving real friction with not gold-plating an unvalidated product.

How have you managed this tension? Building features that genuinely help users get started without over-engineering an MVP that hasn't proven itself yet?",1,1767367359.0,micro_saas,1,1.0,False

The walk into the building felt longer than usual. My badge scanned at the door with the same dull beep it always made, but my pulse spiked like it was doing something new.

At my desk, I set my bag down and logged in with fingers I hoped no one noticed were shaking. The email icon blinked in the corner of the screen. Unread. I clicked it. The subject line expanded across the top of the screen.



**“Opportunity for Discussion: Internal Systems and Coherence”**



My stomach dropped. I scanned the sender information first, like that might make it safer. It was routed through an administrative address. Formal. No name I recognized personally. Just a title. I opened it.



**“From: Internal Systems and Coherence**

**To: Nicole Bennett**

**Subject: Opportunity for Discussion**



*Nicole,*

Based on observed performance and recent internal needs, we would like to invite you to a brief discussion regarding a potential role expansion within Internal Systems and Coherence. This is not a formal offer at this time. This support function typically operates through secure channels and does not require changes to an employee’s primary worksite. The purpose of the conversation would be to discuss your current responsibilities, interests, and availability, and to determine whether further steps would be appropriate.

*Best regards,*

*Internal Systems and Coherence*

*Organizational Development”*



A smaller line beneath the signature listed a routing note.



*“Alignment Review: First Principle Collective.”*



I read it once. Then again. It didn’t mention an application. It didn’t reference anything I had sent. It didn’t say why me. Just that they had noticed. My heart hammered against my ribs as I scrolled back up, half expecting another paragraph to appear. Something accusatory. Something explaining itself. Nothing did. It was reasonable. Careful. Neutral. Which somehow made it worse.

I leaned back in my chair and stared at the screen, my reflection faintly visible in the dark glass between lines of text. Observed performance. I minimized the email and sat there for a second, grounding myself. Breathing. Counting. Then I stood up.

Riley’s desk was two rows over. She looked up as soon as she saw me coming, eyes flicking instinctively to my face. “Well?” she asked. I lowered my voice. “Can I show you something?” She rolled her chair back and patted the space beside her. I pulled the email up again and angled the screen toward her. She read it slowly. Carefully. When she looked back up at me, she was smiling. “You didn’t imagine it,” she said. “I didn’t apply,” I whispered. “I know,” she said. “That’s the point.” I swallowed. “I didn’t even send anything.” Riley leaned back in her chair, studying me the way she did when she was choosing her words on purpose. “Nicole,” she said, “you don’t have to send something for people to notice you.”



That landed harder than I expected.



Across the room, keyboards clicked. Phones rang. Someone laughed at something unrelated. The office kept moving. But for the first time, it felt like it was moving around me instead of past me.

I went back to my desk and tried to work. That was the plan, at least. I opened the same programs I always did. Answered the same types of emails. Moved through the routine that usually carried me through the morning without much effort. My hands knew what to do even when my attention didn’t. Every few minutes, my eyes drifted back to the email. It sat open in the background, minimized but not gone. I brought it back up once. Then again. The wording didn’t change. It stayed careful. Neutral. Almost considerate. I tried to remember specific moments that might have stood out. Conversations I had handled. Problems I had stepped into quietly. None of it felt dramatic enough to explain why someone had taken the time to notice.

Mid morning, during a meeting that usually faded into background noise, someone asked a question and the room stalled. I answered without thinking. The response came out clean, already formed. A few heads nodded. Someone typed something into their notes. My stomach tightened. Not with pride, but with awareness. Had I always done that?

Back at my desk, I opened a reply. The cursor blinked at me, patient enough to feel personal. I typed slowly.



*“Thank you for reaching out. I would be open to discussing the opportunity and learning more about the role.”*



I paused. It sounded too eager. I deleted the last sentence and tried again.



*“I would be open to a brief conversation to better understand the scope of the role and next steps.”*



Better. Safer.



I added my availability. Kept it short. Professional. Unassuming. I reread it three times, searching for something I had accidentally revealed. Confidence. Ambition. Need. It looked like a normal reply. That didn’t make my hands shake any less. I hovered over the send button longer than I meant to, long enough to think about Sunday night. About the draft I had deleted. About unbookmarking the posting and telling myself there was still time. This felt like time catching up. I inhaled, held it for a count of three, and clicked send.



Nothing happened. No confirmation. No fanfare.



The message disappeared into my sent folder like it had always belonged there. For a moment, I just stared at the screen. Then I minimized the window and forced myself back into my work.

At lunch, I sat beside Riley at the table like usual. We were all talking about nothing important, Riley was going on about something she’d watched the night before. A mutual annoyance between Caleb and Julian about the vending machines. Plans that didn’t really exist yet. I almost forgot. Almost.

Halfway through complaining about a printer that never worked, Paige said, “Oh. Apparently I am meeting with someone from Organizational Development later.” She said it like it was nothing. Like she hadn’t been thinking about it all morning. “They said they want to pick my brain about consistency stuff,” she added, shrugging. “Whatever that means. Julian nodded once and had a hint of confusion on his face. Caleb raised an eyebrow, glanced at me, then went back to his food. Riley didn’t react at all. I felt something settle in my chest.

The rest of the afternoon passed quietly. Work got done. Conversations stayed surface level. The email stayed sent. By the time the day wound down, I had convinced myself I hadn’t done anything reckless. I shut down my computer, gathered my things, and stood up with everyone else. As I left, I checked my sent folder one last time. The message was still there.



Delivered.



Waiting.



That night, my apartment felt smaller than usual. Not claustrophobic. Just close, like the walls had leaned in a little while I was gone. I kicked off my shoes by the door and stood there longer than necessary, listening to the hum of the refrigerator and the distant sound of traffic outside. I didn’t turn on the TV. I set my bag down, poured a glass of water I forgot to drink, and sat at the small table by the window.

My laptop was already there, closed, exactly where I’d left it that morning. I opened it anyway. The sent email was still there. I opened it and stared at my name in the header, the timestamp, the proof that I’d done something I couldn’t undo by pretending it hadn’t happened. It still sounded reasonable. Calm. Like it wasn’t asking anything from me yet. Just a conversation. Just information. Just a possibility.

I leaned back in my chair and stared at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. I could say no. I could go to the meeting and decide it wasn’t for me. I could keep my job, keep my routine, keep the careful balance I’d built to make everything work, and nothing bad would happen if I stayed exactly where I was. And then another thought followed. Quieter. Heavier.

Something would happen if I didn’t go. Not immediately. Not something I could point to. Just… eventually. I pictured myself a year from now, standing in the same kitchen, holding the same chipped mug, telling myself I’d been patient. That the timing hadn’t been right. That I’d made the responsible choice. The image didn’t scare me.



That was worse.



I closed my eyes and let the feeling settle where it wanted to. I wasn’t afraid of failing. I was afraid of being seen and having to decide who I was once that happened. I thought about the posting, the language, how familiar it had felt. How it described things I’d already been doing quietly, without permission. I thought about Paige mentioning her meeting like it was nothing. About Julian nodding like it made sense. About Riley smiling like this hadn’t surprised her at all. I thought about how tired I’d been lately and how alive I’d felt that afternoon, just answering a question out loud. The truth arrived without ceremony. I wanted this. Not because it promised anything. Not because it guaranteed change. Because I was curious. Because I didn’t want to look back later and wonder who I might’ve been if I’d stepped forward when the door was already open.

I closed the laptop gently, like I was afraid of startling the thought away. Then I stood, washed the glass I hadn’t used, and turned off the kitchen light. In bed, I stared at the ceiling a while longer, my mind unusually quiet. For the first time in days, I wasn’t rehearsing what I’d say if someone asked. I already knew.



The next morning felt steadier than I expected. Not lighter. Just settled, like something inside me had found its footing overnight even if the path ahead was still blurry. I was carrying a thin stack of paperwork to another floor when the elevator doors slid open and Caleb stepped in.



“Hey,” he said, smiling a little as he reached out to stop the doors. “Hey.” He took the spot beside me without thinking, close enough to feel familiar but not intrusive. Jacket slung over one arm, empty coffee cup in the other, the look of someone who’d stepped outside for air and come back unchanged. “Break?” I asked. “Yeah,” he said. “Figured I owed myself one.” “Did it help?” He tilted his head, considering. “Maybe a little. Not in the way I wanted, though.” I smiled. “That sounds about right.”

The elevator hummed as it started up, the numbers above the door ticking slowly, giving us time we didn’t have to fill if we didn’t want to. He glanced at me again, softer this time. “You seem… okay today.” “Do I?” “Yeah,” he said. “More you.”



I let that sit for a second.



“I think I finally slept.” “That’ll do it,” he said. Then, after a beat, “Or something clicked.” I looked at him, surprised. He shrugged lightly. “You get a look sometimes. Like you’ve made a decision you haven’t announced yet.” I laughed under my breath. “Have you always been this observant?” “Only about you,” he said, like it was obvious. Then, gentler, “You don’t have to explain anything.”



I appreciated that more than I could say.



“They reached out,” I said anyway. “At work. Not an offer. Just… a conversation.” He nodded, like he’d already placed that puzzle piece. “And you didn’t shut it down.” “No.” “Good.” The elevator continued its slow climb. “I wasn’t sure I would,” I admitted. “But I didn’t back out.” He bumped his shoulder lightly against mine, barely there, easy, familiar. “That’s usually how I know you’re serious.” I smiled. “You make it sound like you’ve seen this before.” “I have,” he said. “Different versions. Same look.”

The elevator slowed, chimed, and the doors slid open. “This is you,” he said, stepping back slightly to let me pass. “Yeah.” I stepped by him. “Thanks.” “For what?” “For not making it a thing.” He smiled again, warmer this time. “It already is a thing. I’m just not naming it for you.” I stepped out, my heart a little fuller than it had been when I got in. Behind me, the doors closed, and the elevator carried him away.



The invite came just before lunch. No preamble. No explanation. Just a new block of time appearing on my calendar like it had always been there.



**“Subject: Internal Discussion**

**Organizer: Internal Systems & Coherence**

**Alignment Authority: First Principle Collective**

**Duration: 30 minutes**

**Location: Conference Room B / Secure Line”**



There was nothing unusual about the formatting. No urgency markers. No flagged importance. Just a standard meeting request, sandwiched between a recurring check-in and a placeholder reminder I’d never bothered to delete. I checked the date.

Tomorrow.

My cursor hovered over the response options. Accept. Tentative. Decline. I clicked Accept. The calendar updated immediately. The block turning solid, locked in place. A small confirmation banner appeared, then vanished.

1q21352,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1q21352/did_anyone_else_have_a_disappointing_reading_year/,Did anyone else have a disappointing reading year?,"I read a fair amount of popular fantasy and speculative fiction in 2025 and for whatever reason, did not really vibe with most of these books even though they're BELOVED in the fantasy community. Not sure if my tastes are changing or I just tried the wrong books for me. I think in 2026, I'll try fewer fantasy epics and more lighter speculative fiction.

Anyone else have a ""meh"" reading year? Here are some of the most popular books I read. WARNING: Very unpopular opinions ahead!

11/22/63- My first read of 2025. 3 stars. I always struggle with the length of King's books (this one could have been edited down by like 200 pages) and how he writes female characters. Loved the ending though. 

Before the Coffee Gets Cold- 3.5 stars. Did not love the translation of this book and felt it would  likely work better in Japanese. The premise was cute and interesting, though got repetitive after a while.

Seas of Tranquility- 3 stars. Such a letdown after the 5-star automatic-favorited Station Eleven. Smushing a sprawling space time travel sci-fi epic into 270 pages really doesn't work well.

A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time book 14)- 4 stars- I've been reading this series in fits and starts for like 14 years since college. After slogging though through the slog, I REALLY found the series found its footing and direction again under Sanderson. In fantasy I generally prefer character/political/mystery elements over battle scenes, and since A Memory of Light is one large battle, my eyes glazed over a bit during action descriptions. HOWEVER, that's very much a ""me"" thing. I loved getting to say goodbye to Randland. 

The Way of Kings- 2 stars: I love Mistborn and Sanderson's Wheel of Time entries, but could NOT get into this one at all. It took me 2 months to read because I kept putting it down. I felt it could have been edited down and I thought many of the characters were under-developed. did not make me want to pick up the rest of Stormlight Archive. 

Lions of Al-Rassan- Likely 2 stars. I have not technically finished this one yet but I'm really struggling. It's VERY different than I thought it was going to be, and I feel that a lack of knowledge of the historical influence is a detriment to my reading enjoyment. I also struggled to differentiate/remember characters until about halfway through, and just am not connecting with the story. I have about 100 pages left.

So I ask her if she wanna do something on Saturday 

(I had layover there for 1day so I would have simply nothing do to on Saturday)

So yeah she agreed we went to a really cool coffee place. Just talking then in the evening we went eating some Mexican food (which was amazing) till this point all went fine laughed a lot.

When I ordered a uber home to the hotel. We were chilling a bit in my room playing cards then she needs to get home around 1am, she missed her train at this point the next would be there around 4am.

So I ordered her a Uber home cause for me was the right thing to do.

The next day I woke up to a wall of text on which she said „Was cool with u but I don’t not have a crush on you and u shouldn’t have one on me“(was way longer but in short form)

All just I ordered her the Uber home 

Since then we still in contact but when I said to her I just was friendly and I totally do not have a crush her she’s kinda „mad“

I actually respected the heck out of this girl and unfortunately made me like her more. I think I am going to try to stay friends though. And I will need some advice about that but let me get into the body language part. 

Basically, I met this girl at a party. She approached me first and even ask for my number after talking for 5 minutes. We had alot in common and she kept saying I was cute. I also started to hug her and touch her hands. She didnt pull away and even grab my hands as well. She did all of this while sober btw. 

We had a serious convo and I think that was what messed me up. Because we started talking about red flags in dating and what are we looking for. I didnt really start this convo, she did. Turns out she is visiting from out of state. And she has never had a bf. She is extremely picky as she told me. Well once New years happen, I didnt try to kiss her which may not be a thing since we just met.

Anyways, I texted her the next day and ask to meet up since her flight was leaving in a day. She took forever to text me back. And when she finally did. She said that she is too busy since she is visiting friends. However, she said she would meet up in the morning of her flight. 

So I just met up with her and out of the gate her body language was stiff. She no longer was relaxed and her arms were crossed. She was guarding herself. She didnt even want me to buy her coffee. We talked for 2 hrs and she rarely asked me questions yet she talked a long time to me. She wasnt self centered but it was like she already knew how it was going to go down. She told me at the end. That I am a nice guy and super sweet. She isnt looking for a bf right now and she is a horrible texter. 

Dang she covered all her bases lol. But then she said she wants to be friends and will try to keep in touch. I asked if she is serious and she said yeah call me sometimes because I wouldnt mind talking to you. 

So now I wonder was it because I was too nice/sweet or we just were in different stages of life. Im in med school and super busy and she is in grad school in a different state and rarely comes to my state. 

That is why I wonder did she really find me attractive and I ruined it. Or was this how she was always going to play it. Also would you keep in touch as friends since she seem serious about it? ",1,1767366685.0,bodylanguage,25,1.0,False

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

Part of it was stubbornness—I'm particular about what ""total balance"" actually means (it needs to account for pending charges for proper conservative projections). But mostly, it came down to a fundamentally different approach to money management.

I think of financial planning as two parts: micro and macro. The macro is long-term goals like retirement and buying a house, whereas the micro is, ""Did I cover my obligations this month without going into debt?"" For me, the macro comes naturally from executing the micro, so I don't really care about ten year projections (at least when it comes to week-to-week planning).

What I care about is *much* simpler: **Did I do what I needed to do this month to stay on track with my bigger goals?**

The problem is that most apps drown you in data. They want you to categorize every expense. Is coffee a drink or a grocery? Is Netflix entertainment, does live music get its own bucket? It's paralyzing. Whereas, what I actually need to focus on is what I call **Obligations**: the things I've decided I need to cover each month to hit my longer-term goals. That's rent, utilities, childcare, phone bills, allowances I've set aside, HOA, but also things like a Japan trip fund or an extra mortgage principal payment or monthly emergency fund contributions. These are conscious choices about where my money needs to go.

This approach made my monthly planning really simple math: *Income* (salary, reimbursements, whatever's in checking) minus *Obligations* minus *Credit Card Payments Due* equals *This Month's Leftover*. That's the one number I care about. It tells me: *after everything I've committed to, am I in the green or red?* If I'm green, I have breathing room. If I'm red, I need to adjust.

But there's a second number that matters too, because credit cards have cycles. The money I spend this month doesn't come due until next month. So I do the same calculation for next month, **using** ***This Month's Leftover*** **as next month's starting point.** Those two numbers, *This Month's Leftover and Next Month's Projection,* are all I need to know.

I don't care what I spent on coffee or movies or food. Those don't factor in because I've already accounted for my obligations. Everything else is breathing room.

I looked for an app that shared this financial planning philosophy. Couldn't find one. So I built it.

**Pfynn** takes this whole framework and automates it. You onboard by adding your obligations, your income, connect your accounts via Plaid, and each week it spits out those two numbers. Your weekly review becomes your financial strategy. No categorizing transactions. No budget guilt. Just clarity on whether you're okay.

I launched the first version into [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/htUHss2A) a few weeks ago, and I'm still in the early stages, working through bugs and polish with real users.

The biggest lesson so far? Sometimes the processes we develop for ourselves are worth packaging. Not every personal workflow translates to an app that resonates with others, but I'm finding that a lot of people who've bounced off YNAB or similar tools are craving this kind of simplicity.

I'd love feedback from this community: What did you find exhausting about your previous budgeting tools? And what would ""just enough"" financial awareness look like for you?

But don't worry - it's actually pretty simple when you know what to look for.

**Battery Life Is Everything**

For big areas, you need a robot mop that won't die halfway through cleaning. Look for models with at least 90-120 minutes of runtime. Some cheaper ones only last 60 minutes, which means they'll head back to charge before finishing your whole floor.

**Smart Navigation Beats Random Cleaning**

Random cleaning patterns waste time and miss spots. You want a robot mop with smart mapping technology. These models create a map of your home and clean in organized rows instead of bouncing around randomly. They're way more efficient for large spaces.

**Water Tank Size Matters**

Small water tanks mean constant refills. For big areas, aim for tanks that hold at least 300ml of water. This gives you enough coverage without babysitting the machine every 20 minutes.

**Multi-Floor Mapping**

If your large living space spreads across different levels, get a robot mop that can save multiple floor maps. This feature lets the robot remember each floor's layout without starting from scratch every time.

**What About Obstacles?**

Large spaces usually have more furniture and obstacles. Look for models with good sensor technology that can navigate around chair legs, coffee tables, and other furniture without getting stuck.

**App Control and Scheduling**

You'll want to control your robot mop remotely and set cleaning schedules. Most decent models come with smartphone apps that let you start cleaning while you're at work or set daily routines.

**Mopping vs Vacuum Combo**

Some robot mops also vacuum, which is handy for large spaces that collect more dirt and debris. These combo units save you from running two separate machines.

Before making your final choice, check out the current selection of robot mops available [here](https://athomewave.com/robot-mop). You'll find various models designed specifically for different room sizes and cleaning needs.

The key is matching the robot mop's features to your space's specific requirements. Don't just go for the cheapest option - investing in the right features upfront saves you frustration later.

 I take probiotics and yoghurt relatively regularly so I hope not likely to be a gut issue, but confusing!

I feel well, and the Internet would suggest its not uncommon, and nutrients are still somewhat absorbed (although my brain has conveniently interpreted it as a way to continue to overeat cashews on a regular basis as they're ""not being absorbed"" lol)

Has anyone else found this? Laxatives have not been part of my struggles, so I've always been regular to a certain extent, even if ""needing"" the assistance of a binge to ""push food along"" during severe periods...but what the hell? I can understand a few times a day, but 6+???

1q20seo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1q20seo/my_ex_lived_a_double_life_with_two_other/,My ex lived a double life with two other boyfriends this is how I found out,"I (M28) had been with my ex-girlfriend for 7 years, but I found out she had two boyfriends behind my back, and here comes the story. You need to hold on tight, because it gets a bit complicated due to all the different lies.

It all started on a completely ordinary day. She was at a friend’s place and asked if I could come pick her up. Of course I would.

When we return to our apartment building with a shared stairwell, there is another man on his way out. I don’t really notice his face, but my ex walks straight into him. At first, I think it’s just the downstairs neighbor heading out, so I manage to say to my ex:

“What the fuck are you doing?”

As I’m about to enter the stairwell myself, the man suddenly stops me, puts a hand on my chest, and asks:

“Who are you?”

I answer:

“My name is \*\*\*\*. I live here with my girlfriend.”

His facial expression changes completely. He turns around and sprints into the stairwell. I run after him.

We lived on the first floor, but my ex had run up to the second floor to hide. The man reaches the first floor a bit faster than me and stands outside our apartment while shouting up the stairs for her.

Then he turns to me and asks:

“How long have you been with her?”

I answer:

“About 7 years.”

He looks completely shocked and says:

“Funny… because the girl I’ve been in a relationship with for 2 years is standing right there.”

And there she was, standing on the stairs, looking like a massive idiot.

He shows me pictures from a vacation they had been on last year, and I can show pictures from a vacation me and her had been on the same year. It felt completely unreal.

They had talked about having children, and the same had me and her.

**Background**

In January 2024, I had to submit when I wanted to take my summer vacation. As always, I ask her, and we agree on some weeks together.

My ex was doing her waitress education, and as we get closer to summer, about three months before, I suddenly get told that she has been “asked” if she wants to go on a wine course in Kolding, a city in Denmark, for a week.

I had no idea how that worked, but of course I supported her and said:

“That’s fine. Then I’ll just move our vacation to Nice to the last week of my vacation.”

After that, one of my friends asks if I want to travel with him during the week she is on “the course.” I might as well, so I go.

In the months leading up to this “course,” she starts going to solarium a lot, probably to cover up that she was actually going traveling with guy number two.

While they are away, and I myself am also traveling, she sends me long messages about the meals they have on “the course,” what menus they make, how they are presented, and so on.

I come home from vacation, and she has “come home from the course.” Shortly after, me and her go on vacation together.

But to guy number two, she had said she was going interrailing, traveling across Europe by train, with a friend. So while we are away, she is sending him long messages about which cities she and her friend are experiencing, which trains they are taking, and so on.

**Back to the stairwell**

It ends with me and the other guy exchanging numbers. I go into the apartment. She does not go with me but follows guy number two, because she tries to save the relationship that has been shortest and is the newest.

I am shaking from the whole situation. I actually call her parents and tell them that we are no longer together and explain what just happened in the stairwell.

After that, I pack a bag and go to a friend who lives in another city. I lock the door, as I know she didn’t have a key with her.

**Guy number two’s perspective**

Now you need to hold on, because now we see it from guy number two’s angle.

Guy number two was going traveling the day after with the company he worked for, and he was at a party very close to the apartment me and my ex lived in.

He had been with my ex for 2 years but had never been in the apartment, and he had told her several times that if he didn’t get into the apartment soon, he would leave her.

But she is insanely good at manipulating and playing on emotions, so he stays.

This day is a bit different. He is at the party nearby and is a bit drunk and thinks:

“Fuck it, I’ll go over and say goodbye before I leave tomorrow.”

He goes to the apartment. The apartment door is unlocked, because I had just quickly gone to pick her up from her friend.

He walks inside the apartment and sees a package on the table with her name on it. He walks further in and sees my PC in my office. He is extremely confused. He goes back out and sees my shoes. Size 45. His girlfriend definitely didn’t use that size.

Then he leaves.

And that’s when me and my ex are on our way into the stairwell.

After the confrontation in the stairwell, I go into the apartment, but guy number two leaves the stairwell. My ex follows him and tries to sort out the situation, without success.

Guy number two goes down to a bar where he knows one of her friends is sitting and says to the friend:

“You need to take her, because I don’t want to talk to her.”

The friend takes her into the bar. After that, guy number two goes home and sleeps, as he is traveling the next day.

The next day, the other guy calls me and asks if I had been at the bar in the city afterward with a bag.

Because the friend had said that I had shown up there with a bag, stood in front of my ex, and said:

“Four years… you know what you’ve done.”

I tell him that I had been at a friend’s place all night and hadn’t been anywhere else.

I then ask for the friend’s Facebook and write to her asking if we could meet for a coffee and talk about everything that had happened. This friend I had only heard the name of before and never seen her.

We meet at a café, where she tells me what happened the day before, and I tell my side. She can clearly see that it wasn’t me who was there with the bag that night.

So we start doing a bit of detective work. Who was the man with the bag?

We actually find him, and sure enough, he had been in a relationship with her for 4 years.

I get his number and call him. He is crying uncontrollably on the phone, because he actually knew about me. He knew my car’s license plate by heart. He knew where I trained and where I worked.

After that, I add guy number two to the call. It was so strange. Three guys who had been with the same girl all talking on the phone together at the same time.

She had kept stringing him along by saying she would leave me, but that was of course a lie. Guy number three had even bought an apartment for them, and again she had just dragged everything out.

But we guys had to stick together to not fall for all her lies. And we did.

After the stairwell incident, she had fled home to her mother.

Already the day after the stairwell incident, I wrote her a message:

“Are you picking up your shit yourself, or should I just pack it down?”

She wanted to pick it up herself, or her brother would come pick up some clothes.

Here I then find a lot of Christmas gifts she had received from the other guys and hidden deep inside her closet.

She stays at her mother’s place for about a week and then flees to a friend who lives in the city.

After this, we had to figure out which things she wanted and which I should have. It actually went really well without problems, until I sat down on the bed.

She sat down very close to me, but I then moved all the way to the edge instead, because I thought it was too weird.

She is so manipulative. She starts claiming that I am lying to her friend and the other guys, and I am not lying. She just keeps claiming that I am lying so much that you almost start doubting yourself.

But it’s like I come out of the stream of thoughts she had started, and I throw her out of the apartment.

Me and the other guys keep talking and try to put together this insane puzzle of lies.

At the time, me and her had a dog together. She used the dog as an angle to try to get close to me again:

“It’s ours. Can’t I come and visit him?”

I give in, and she comes to the apartment. At first it goes fine, nothing there, until she flips out again and asks why I am walking around spreading lies about her in the city and saying that she owes money to some guy, and so on.

Again, it was of course a lie. I had absolutely not said anything to anyone. Again, it ends with me throwing her out of the apartment.

The day after she had been at my place, guy number two calls me and says that she had also been at his place yesterday, and they had talked for 4 hours, where she again had just sat and lied straight to his face, saying that she had been scared of guy number three, and so on.

Later that evening, guy number three asks if he can come by. Of course he could. Here he tells me that she had also been at his place the same evening.

So after I threw her out, she went up to guy number three, talked shit about me, and tried to make me the bad guy. After she had been at guy number three’s place, she then went home to guy number two and talked shit about guy number three.

She knew we were talking to each other, so it was clearly an attempt to split us guys up so she could continue the shit she had going on.

The guys and I meet that evening, block her, and write to her that she needs to stay away.

After we did that, all hell broke loose. Our phones were being called nonstop from unknown numbers.

Eventually, we answer. It is her mother, who threatens us with death. Completely insane.

While we are talking to the mother, we can hear my ex talking in the background, where she is trying to manipulate her mother.

In the end, I take the phone from one of the guys and try to de escalate the situation, and it ends with us hanging up. After that, we guys just went home.

I wake up the next day to a voicemail where her mother threatens me with death.

I’m like: “WTF, I’m not going to accept this shit.”

I know that the mother works in a field where it is really not good to have a case like this against her.

So I choose to call the police. I tell them:

“I’ve been threatened with death, not because I’m scared, but because I want you to write it down, so you have it if it turns into a case at some point.”

I then play the voicemail, and the police officer writes everything down exactly as it was said.

A lot of other things also happened, but it’s hard to explain because it’s so complicated with lies and made up stories.

But I hope you still got something out of my story.",11,1767366059.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.92,False

For the past year, I've been working on a SaaS project with a small team. I'm a product manager with about a decade of experience. I've worked in both the country's largest banks and various startups. Since around 2020, I've been fully responsible for digital products in the projects I worked on: from the idea agreed upon with investors/founders to the first beta and then production.

In 2024, my latest project ended, and I decided to try making my own product, since it seemed to me that I had enough brains and experience for this.

P.S. perhaps to people with perfect English it might seem that this text was generated with the help of an LLM, but that's not the case. I wrote it in my native language, and then translated it to English with the help of an LLM. In the comments you'll see my real level of English. 😎

# The Idea

During my time as a product manager, I accumulated many ideas that I wrote down in Notion and other similar services. I started going through all of this and evaluating how relevant it was at the current moment. Honestly, I don't remember exactly how I came to the Telegram Mini Apps story, but I understood how WeChat & AliPay worked in China, where these platforms are essentially ""a significant part of the country's internet.""

So, having started studying the technological side of what mini apps are, I understood that, roughly speaking, it's ""mobile web wrapped in Telegram infrastructure"" and launching inside the Telegram app. By infrastructure I mean Telegram ID and Telegram API.

The most convenient thing for the end user is that when launching such a ""mini-application,"" they're already authorized in it through Telegram ID:

* No need to download an application, it launches inside Telegram.
* No need to register, authorization goes through Telegram Username (phone and email are not shared).
* No interface limitations unlike bots, which only cover part of the scenarios where using a text interface is convenient for solving specific tasks.
* The QR code that's generated for the application, similar to a personal account, channel, chat, immediately launches the application. For example, you approach a coffee stand you've never used before, scan the QR code, the application launches, you pay for coffee with a pastry and pick it up.

Essentially, it turned out that the story with digitalization of roughly any product or service following the WeChat example is not yet the default in any messenger (honestly, I don't understand at all what the WhatsApp team ""develops,"" for example).

# Team

Having mulled over the ideas in my head, discussed them with smart acquaintances, looked at competitors (there are many, but they're all the same small startups without funding and monopolization in the market), I decided to do the project.

My team and I have been doing various projects for about 5 years: front-end, back-end, designers, and devops. We work remotely, there's no office and none is planned.

# Stack

The stack is standard: React, Node.js, design in Figma, infrastructure in Cloudflare, Digital Ocean. We've done a bunch of projects with it, for now this is more than enough, new approaches and tools are implemented when necessary.

# Market

At the current moment there's a fairly serious problem: potential users of such services don't know about them and don't understand their advantages. That is, mini apps have existed since late 2022, but are unknown to the mass user.

# MVP

Taking into account the point above, an understanding formed that the MVP couldn't be assembled using various Vibe Coding tools. And a year ago they were much worse than they are now.

For the MVP to be clear to the user, we defined the scenarios:

* An interface to create a Telegram Mini App without a single line of code in principle.
* The first template that will allow creating an application for digital content (primarily courses). Description, cost, pictures. Possibly a free demo.
* Payment service integration. Again without a single line of code, just insert the key in the field and click ""Save.""

# Target Audience

The audience is very broad, we promote the idea that instead of a website or mobile application, which take a long time and are expensive to develop if you're not an IT specialist, make an application in Telegram (if it's popular in your region) to sell your goods or services.

Essentially, your own Ebay/Shopify/any other well-known service for creating online stores in Telegram.

At launch we're focusing on CIS, since Telegram is maximally popular here and actively used every day.

# Launch

We launched the project [https://miniappsbuilder.com](https://miniappsbuilder.com) around April 2025 and started watching who creates what stores, what features are missing, of course fixing bugs and adding new features.

For early adopters there were unique pricing plans to launch applications for their business faster and start tracking their results.

# Metrics

Right now we have standard metrics:

* Approximately 1-1.5% conversion from registration and creating the first application to subscription.
* Mostly they pay monthly, annual subscriptions are still the smaller part.
* Approximately 60-65% conversion from registration to creating the first application.
* The first few dozen paying users.

This is an update to my last post. My mom set a boundary this morning with her roommate, asking him not to discipline me as if I was his child. It's one thing for him to politely ask me to keep the noise down in the morning and it's another for him to accuse me of having no respect for my parents or to tell me he knows more about my religion than I do (yes, he really said that to me) and to lecture me on what I should or shouldn't practice.

My mom explained to him that I needed to make breakfast in the morning because I have stomach problems. At some point, he said that he'll say whatever he wants to say in the house. My mom told him that maybe in that case, he should look for a new room to rent elsewhere. He started yelling at her at full volume. He glanced over at the coffee table, which had a crescent moon lamp that I recently bought, and he said, ""Do you know what that is?"". My mom replied that she knew it was an Islamic symbol but that it was beautiful and she asked me to set it on the coffee table so she could look at it. He said, ""First it starts with no drinking alcohol at the table, then she buys this Muslim lamp, next she'll introduce some other rule"". He left the room shortly after. 

For clarification, I never said no one could drink at the table, just that I couldn't sit there if there was going to be drinking, and I haven't said anything about my parents' numerous Christmas decorations because it's their home and their lives, not mine. I was probably in the wrong for making breakfast with my headphones on but since then I've stopped doing that. 

My parents leave for work soon. I'm really anxious about being alone in the house with him and my whole day feels derailed. Any advice on how to handle a potential confrontation would be greatly appreciated.",1,1767365830.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Then COVID hit. Back to 253 lbs. Now at 218 lbs. No brutal workouts. No starvation. Just a few simple habits.

The habits:

1. No sugary drinks. Water, tea, coffee - no sugar.
2. Three meals a day. No snacks between.
3. 15-20 min walk after each meal. Indoor counts. Some slow movement — tai chi style, nothing intense.
4. One outdoor walk daily. Hour or more.
5. Around 3000 calories. Not starving. Slightly hungry, but livable.

That's it. No magic pills. No suffering. No ""rise at 5am and destroy yourself"" nonsense.

1q20nlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1q20nlk/telling_all_on_my_nq_interviews_part_2/,Telling all on my NQ interviews (part 2),"This morning I posted about 5 of my NQ interview experiences. These were either ones where I got the job (3 offers and recently accepted 1) or where I think the firm’s processes /interviewers got it wrong (see original post)

For the final 3, I thought I’d detail where I got it wrong and why. I think it’s important to share because it often feels like everyone just magically jumps to NQ seamlessly.

For context, I qualified at a big US firm in London and I was offered an NQ role after a US secondment but this fell through due to visa issues. I took 6 months out due to illness. I didn’t use recruiters for many of my applications because I found that they would often make the process more difficult and wouldn’t communicate stuff in the way I wanted them to. All interviews were in various parts of finance.

1. UK international, unsure why I kept getting through the stages as feedback was always bad.

1st stage - technical interview - multiple scenario questions in relation to certain common transaction documents (e.g., the client wants this covenant, how would you draft it and how would you negotiate it?). I hadn’t really gone into that level of depth and because of the break, I couldn’t really remember all that much.

2nd stage - Competency and Motivational - I think I got caught up in trying to differentiate my training firm and the firm I was applying to, to the extent that I said things that just weren’t accurate. The differences were not in the places I thought they were and I think I offended them slightly. The interviewers brought me up on this at the time.

3rd stage - Meet the associates, I was simply too nervous. This was an in-office tour and coffee chat and I barely asked them anything or tried to engage as I just froze.

Obviously rejected, taught me some good lessons though.

2. Magic circle - 2 stage process. The second one I did.

1st stage - technical exercise. Just a selection of technical questions (why would you use this clause, how does this financing type work etc.). I had simultaneously under and over prepared for this. I spent 2 weeks trying to learn absolutely everything about this area. When it got to the interview, I simply couldn’t remember most of it (even if I knew it deep down) and panicked. I had also gone too broad and forgotten to deep dive on the basics.

2nd stage (they took everyone through because it was one straight after the other). They asked motivational, competency, some commercial awareness (an opportunity for a client, AI impact etc) questions and also asked me to explain more about my role in my deals. I was really nervous and put out because I knew the first interview had gone badly. I was so obsessed with sounding smart “like an Associate” that I just rambled and forgot to actually highlight my USPs.

Obviously rejected again. They didn’t actually give me feedback that was too bad, I think they were aware that I was nervous and that I had limited experience in that area.

3. UK national - 2 stages. They never actually got back to me after the second stage (which was annoying), so I can only tell you why I think I didn’t get it.

First stage - written exercise. We were sent a fake email by a client who wanted us to summarise and apply a new legal development to their business (this was a reg role, it was an FCA briefing and the client was a fintech neobank). It wasn’t too difficult, but you were given a very tight period of 30 minutes to do it. I feel like it went okay, but I really didn’t leave myself time to read through it, so I imagine it wasn’t presented particularly well.

Second stage - 15 mins talking through my findings. They agreed with my findings and I think I talked through this well. I had really revised what was important to this type of client and associated regimes. Next up they asked motivational and competency, this was one of my first in person ones and I just completely blanked. My answers were really short and basic and whilst I think they liked that it was clear, it didn’t show I really understood the firm.

1q20ncx,https://i.redd.it/k0mcy4go9yag1.jpeg,Chocolate Bannana Almond Flour cake with mocha house,"I will freeze this in single serve pieces for truck food. 

I found ca recipe for a flour cake and asked grok to modify for Almond flour. 

I choose to use sr flour so delivered baking soda and salt.

The glaze is thrown together with about 2 cups powdered sugar, about 1/4 cup cold coffee and a couple tbsp of Cocoa.

Modified Double Chocolate Banana Cake (with Safflower Oil & Almond Flour)This adaptation replaces the unsweetened applesauce with safflower oil for added richness and moisture (safflower oil is a neutral-tasting oil perfect for baking cakes). I've also incorporated almond flour by substituting half the all-purpose flour with it—this adds a nutty flavor, makes the cake slightly denser and moister (great with the chocolate and banana), and boosts protein/fiber while keeping it gluten-light (not fully gluten-free unless you use certified GF ingredients).The result will be a richer, more tender cake that's still lightly sweet and super chocolatey. No frosting needed!Yields: 9 servings
Prep: 10 minutes
Cook: 30–40 minutes (check early, as almond flour can brown faster)
Total: About 40–50 minutesIngredients1 ¼ cups (288 g) mashed ripe bananas (about 3 small/medium)
¾ cup (150 g) light brown sugar, gently packed
½ cup (120 ml) safflower oil (replaces the applesauce for moisture and tenderness)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
½ cup (60 g) all-purpose flour
½ cup (about 50–55 g) blanched almond flour (finely ground; adds nutty depth and moisture)
½ cup (40 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
1 cup (170 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 Tbsp mini chocolate chips for topping (optional)

InstructionsPreheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8×8-inch baking dish.
In a stand mixer (or large bowl with hand mixer), mix the mashed bananas and brown sugar until smooth and the sugar dissolves.
Add the safflower oil, vanilla, and egg. Mix well.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just incorporated (don't overmix—almond flour can make it denser if overworked).
Fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips.
Pour batter into the prepared dish. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips on top if using.
Bake for 30–40 minutes. Start checking at 25 minutes with a toothpick inserted in the center—it should come out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). The cake may take a bit longer than the original due to the oil and almond flour, but avoid overbaking to keep it fudgy.
Cool slightly and enjoy warm for the best melty chocolate experience!

NotesWhy these changes work: The original recipe notes you can substitute neutral oil for applesauce, so safflower oil swaps in perfectly (1:1 by volume). Using half almond flour gives a nice hybrid texture—still cake-like but with extra moistness and nutrition—without needing major adjustments.
Texture tip: This version will be richer and slightly denser than the applesauce original (more like a fudgy brownie-cake hybrid). If you want it even nuttier/more gluten-free, you could try ¾ cup almond flour + ¼ cup all-purpose next time, but test as it may need an extra egg for lift.
Storage: Keeps well at room temp for 2–3 days (like the original—good luck making it last that long!).

1q20dxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q20dxw/my_ex_lived_a_double_life_with_two_other/,My ex lived a double life with two other boyfriends — this is how I found out,"I (M28) had been with my ex-girlfriend for 7 years, but I found out she had two boyfriends behind my back, and here comes the story — but you need to hold on tight, because it gets a bit complicated due to all the different lies.

It all started on a completely ordinary day. She was at a friend’s place and asked if I could come pick her up. Of course I would.

When we return to our apartment building (shared stairwell), there is another man on his way out. I don’t really notice his face, but my ex walks straight into him. At first, I think it’s just the downstairs neighbor heading out, so I manage to say to my ex:

“What the fuck are you doing?”

As I’m about to enter the stairwell myself, the man suddenly stops me, puts a hand on my chest, and asks:

“Who are you?”

I answer:

“My name is \*\*\*\* — I live here with my girlfriend.”

His facial expression changes completely. He turns around and sprints into the stairwell. I run after him.

We lived on the first floor, but my ex had run up to the second floor to hide. The man reaches the first floor a bit faster than me and stands outside our apartment while shouting up the stairs for her.

Then he turns to me and asks:

“How long have you been with her?”

I answer:

“About 7 years.”

He looks completely shocked and says:

“Funny… because the girl I’ve been in a relationship with for 2 years is standing right there.”

And there she was — standing on the stairs, looking like a massive idiot.

He shows me pictures from a vacation they had been on last year, and I can show pictures from a vacation me and her had been on the same year. It felt completely unreal.

They had talked about having children, and the same had me and her.

Background

In January 2024, I had to submit when I wanted to take my summer vacation. As always, I ask her, and we agree on some weeks together.

My ex was doing her waitress education, and as we get closer to summer — about three months before — I suddenly get told that she has been “asked” if she wants to go on a wine course in Kolding (a city in Denmark) for a week.

I had no idea how that worked, but of course I supported her and said:

“That’s fine — then I’ll just move our vacation to Nice to the last week of my vacation.”

After that, one of my friends asks if I want to travel with him during the week she is on “the course.” I might as well, so I go.

In the months leading up to this “course,” she starts going to solarium a lot — probably to cover up that she was actually going traveling with guy #2.

While they are away — and I myself am also traveling — she sends me long messages about the meals they have on “the course,” what menus they make, how they are presented, etc. etc.

I come home from vacation, and she has “come home from the course.” Shortly after, me and her go on vacation together.

But to guy #2, she had said she was going interrailing (traveling across Europe by train) with a friend. So while we are away, she is sending him long messages about which cities she and her friend are experiencing, which trains they are taking, etc. 😅

Back to the stairwell

It ends with me and the other guy exchanging numbers. I go into the apartment. She does not go with me but follows guy #2, because she tries to save the relationship that has been shortest and is the newest.

I am shaking from the whole situation. I actually call her parents and tell them that we are no longer together and explain what just happened in the stairwell.

After that, I pack a bag and go to a friend who lives in another city. I lock the door, as I know she didn’t have a key with her.

Guy #2’s perspective

Now you need to hold on, because now we see it from guy #2’s angle.

Guy #2 was going traveling the day after with the company he worked for, and he was at a party very close to the apartment me and my ex lived in.

He had been with my ex for 2 years but had never been in the apartment, and he had told her several times that if he didn’t get into the apartment soon, he would leave her.

But she is insanely good at manipulating and playing on emotions, so he stays.

This day is a bit different. He is at the party nearby and is a bit drunk and thinks:

“Fuck it, I’ll go over and say goodbye before I leave tomorrow.”

He goes to the apartment. The apartment door is unlocked (because, as mentioned, I had just quickly gone to pick her up from her friend).

He walks inside the apartment and sees a package on the table with her name on it. He walks further in and sees my PC in my office. He is extremely confused. He goes back out and sees my shoes — size 45. His girlfriend definitely didn’t use that size.

Then he leaves.

And that’s when me and my ex are on our way into the stairwell.

After the confrontation in the stairwell, I go into the apartment, but guy #2 leaves the stairwell. My ex follows him and tries to sort out the situation — without success.

Guy #2 goes down to a bar where he knows one of her friends is sitting and says to the friend:

“You need to take her, because I don’t want to talk to her.”

The friend takes her into the bar. After that, guy #2 goes home and sleeps, as he is traveling the next day.

The next day, the other guy calls me and asks if I had been at the bar in the city afterward with a bag.

Because the friend had said that I had shown up there with a bag, stood in front of my ex, and said:

“Four years… you know what you’ve done.”

I tell him that I had been at a friend’s place all night and hadn’t been anywhere else.

I then ask for the friend’s Facebook and write to her asking if we could meet for a coffee and talk about everything that had happened (this friend I had only heard the name of before, never seen her).

We meet at a café, where she tells me what happened the day before, and I tell my side. She can clearly see that it wasn’t me who was there with the bag that night.

So we start doing a bit of detective work: Who was the man with the bag?

We actually find him, and sure enough — he had been in a relationship with her for 4 years.

I get his number and call him. He is crying uncontrollably on the phone, because he actually knew about me. He knew my car’s license plate by heart. He knew where I trained and where I worked.

After that, I add guy #2 to the call. It was so strange — three guys who had been with the same girl, all talking on the phone together at the same time 😅.

She had kept stringing him along by saying she would leave me, but that was of course a lie. Guy #3 had even bought an apartment for them, and again she had just dragged everything out.

But we guys had to stick together to not fall for all her lies. And we did.

After the stairwell incident, she had fled home to her mother.

Already the day after the stairwell incident, I wrote her a message:

“Are you picking up your shit yourself, or should I just pack it down?”

She wanted to pick it up herself, or her brother would come pick up some clothes.

Here I then find a lot of Christmas gifts she had received from the other guys and hidden deep inside her closet.

She stays at her mother’s place for about a week and then flees to a friend who lives in the city.

After this, we had to figure out which things she wanted and which I should have. It actually went really well without problems — until I sat down on the bed.

She sat down very close to me, but I then moved all the way to the edge instead, because I thought it was too weird.

She is so manipulative. She starts claiming that I am lying to her friend and the other guys, and I am not lying. She just keeps claiming that I am lying — so much that you almost start doubting yourself.

But it’s like I come out of the stream of thoughts she had started, and I throw her out of the apartment.

Me and the other guys keep talking and try to put together this insane puzzle of lies.

At the time, me and her had a dog together. She used the dog as an angle to try to get close to me again:

“It’s ours — can’t I come and visit him?”

I give in, and she comes to the apartment. At first it goes fine — nothing there — until she flips out again and asks why I am walking around spreading lies about her in the city and saying that she owes money to some guy, etc.

Again, it was of course a lie. I had absolutely not said anything to anyone. Again, it ends with me throwing her out of the apartment.

The day after she had been at my place, guy #2 calls me and says that she had also been at his place yesterday, and they had talked for 4 hours, where she again had just sat and lied straight to his face, saying that she had been scared of guy #3, etc.

Later that evening, guy #3 asks if he can come by. Of course he could. Here he tells me that she had also been at his place the same evening 😅.

So after I threw her out, she went up to guy #3, talked shit about me, and tried to make me the bad guy. After she had been at guy #3’s place, she then went home to guy #2 and talked shit about guy #3 😂.

She knew we were talking to each other, so it was clearly an attempt to split us guys up so she could continue the shit she had going on.

The guys and I meet that evening, block her, and write to her that she needs to stay away.

After we did that, all hell broke loose: our phones were being called nonstop from unknown numbers.

Eventually, we answer — it is her mother, who threatens us with death. Completely insane.

While we are talking to the mother, we can hear my ex talking in the background, where she is trying to manipulate her mother.

In the end, I take the phone from one of the guys and try to de-escalate the situation, and it ends with us hanging up. After that, we guys just went home.

I wake up the next day to a voicemail where her mother threatens me with death 😅.

I’m like: “WTF, I’m not going to accept this shit.”

I know that the mother works in a field where it is really not good to have a case like this against her.

So I choose to call the police. I tell them:

“I’ve been threatened with death — not because I’m scared, but because I want you to write it down, so you have it if it turns into a case at some point.”

I then play the voicemail, and the police officer writes everything down exactly as it was said.

A lot of other things also happened, but it’s hard to explain because it’s so complicated with lies and made-up stories.

I posted here before my trip and got so much helpful info and even ended up meeting several other women from Reddit who DM’d me while I was there. Can’t thank you all enough for advice and recommendations! This is detailed because I appreciated reading all of these while planning my trip. 

Hotel:
I stayed at The Pelham in CBD. They upgraded me from an interior room to a king with a window without even asking. Beautiful, vintage, boutique hotel. Incredible staff, very comfy beds, and a perfect location. Very quiet. My average rate was $115/night, which felt like a steal. If you don’t need a hotel bar and daily room service, this IS the spot. 

Christmas Eve: 9600 steps
Landed midday. A tour guide, Deanna DuPont, DM’d me on Reddit and hooked me up with a free ride to Bonfires on the Levee. I changed my flight just so I could go and it was magical. An unforgettable, first night. Got to meet Deanna in person and she is so sweet and knowledgeable about the city! 

Christmas Day: 19000 steps

Saturday: 19000 steps
•Breakfast at Fleur de Lis was outstanding. 
•Whitney Plantation was one of the most powerful experiences of the trip—extremely emotional and absolutely worth it.

Sunday: 20000 steps
•Walked St. Charles to the Garden District.

•Sugar Bowl parade - ended up in front row. It was so much fun!!!•Met up with my two fav gals I connected with on Reddit. 
•River walk, Bourbon to Frenchmen. Maisons for dinner then block party and eyewitness to Don Lemon. 😂 The girls headed to River for the fireworks and I meandered back to my hotel alone taking in my last night in this beautiful city. 

Final Thoughts:

This was my first solo trip and it completely changed how I feel about traveling. When you’re alone, people are curious and welcoming. They talk to you -bartenders, locals, musicians, other travelers. It helps that NOLA is the friendliest city I’ve ever been to!

I never once felt unsafe. I walked EVERYWHERE. I was back to my hotel by 12:30 every night. I didn’t make reservations (table for one is easy to find), didn’t overplan, and let the city guide me, and it worked out beautifully. I don’t know that I will ever top this vacation or this experience. Thank you NOLA!

It was dark, chopped up, and had zero usable counter for anything besides a cutting board.

  
Progress photos: 1) before shots of the narrow galley and the weird half wall, 2) demo with the wall opened, 3) framing/patching and electrical rough-in, 4) cabinet install, 5) countertop and backsplash, 6) finished coffee bar + final wide shots.

  
What I did:

\- Pulled off the upper cabinets on one side and demoed a non-load-bearing half wall that boxed in the entry.

\- Relocated one outlet run and added two new countertop outlets (power off at the breaker, checked with a tester).

\- Built a shallow coffee bar cabinet run: base cabinets, a plywood top, and a small open shelf section.

\- Made the countertop from laminated birch plywood with a hardwood edge band, then sealed it with multiple coats of water-resistant finish.

\- Added a simple tile backsplash and grouted/sealed it.

  
Materials/tools: base cabinets, 3/4 in plywood, hardwood edge strip, tile, thinset, grout, outlet boxes/wire, level, circular saw, oscillating tool, tile saw.

  
Time and cost: about 4 weekends, roughly mid-range budget.

  
Challenges: getting the countertop dead flat (shimmed bases carefully) and matching the wall texture after removing the half wall.

I didnt have any problems until high school started, then I started to have headaches and started to use allergy medicine(my mum has chronic sinusitis and allergies)
It helped a bit, but still couldnt ger rid of it..

Anyway after some struggle I decided to go to ENT, he said i have deviated septum and that my inferior turbinate is big so he will do septoplasty and rfitt of inferior turbinate. It was one exam and they said I should have surgery..

I had surgery and could breath and smell so good for 1-2 months, then I visited ent again and I was put on antibiotics and i Couldn't get rid of my sinusitis issues, he said i should do ct and then we will do fess and also they said i have third adenoid left, i had like 2-3 courses of antibiotic.

Anyway one year later from that surgery i had fess and third adenoid surgery.
Again, everything was good for 1-2 months.

I had also dont know 2-4 courses of antibiotic in following year.

I decided do to ct on my own like 1 year later to see if there is any problem, radiologist said my wisdom tooth could be the problem or other teeth.

I took out wisdom tooth and somehow it was better for like 2-3 weeks.

Then I decided to check all other teeth.
They werent the problem😂

I constantly had facial pressure and loss of smell, it was so freaking hard.

Anyway out of nowhere I started to get acid reflux symptoms, that was one year ago in December, i stopped to drink coffee back then and took short course of ppi.

You can see where this is going, anyway after couple months i still havent resolved my sinus issues.

I saw post on reddit someone went gluten free and resolved sinus issues, i said why not. 

Anyway, I went gluten free and in that time I developed chest pain and throat pain, this was unrelated for gluten free.

So i was put on ppi and i was gluten free, also didnt drink coffee.

Like one month into ppi my sinusitis was so much better, I couldn't believe, i was taking care of my diet and did gluten free and took ppi.

When I stopped ppi my sinusitis got worse after 2 weeks and also acid reflux

Anyway to keep this short, my nutritionist said I have gut dysbiosis and that i should take more prebiotic/probiotics food, more plant based diet and to take multi strain probiotic. She said from multiple courses of antibiotic my gut is wrecked .

Later I found out I am gluten intolerant😂
I did also lactose intolerance test from blood and i am not lactose intolerance
I did endoscopy and they found out i have small hiatal hernia and weak les.

Currently I am off ppi for one month , I am gluten free, drinking probiotic, trying to eat many plants as possible, drinking kefir, sauerkraut.

I needed like 5 months of good diet to say"" now I am good"".
I am not sure what was the biggest problem for me, if gut dysbiosis lead to acid reflux, or mine diet fixed both.

Me: “Sure. For an extra $20K.”

Also Me: Ghosted them like a Tinder date with bad credit.


Act II: Smiles & Side-Eyes, LLP
Everything was going great. The team adored me. The head honcho was singing my praises.
The co-founder, though? Gave me ""hates fun"" vibes.

Two weeks of enthusiastic emails and love bombing.

Then came the “We’ve chosen another candidate” kiss-off.

Job post goes back up a week later like nothing happened.

I sent a polite-but-petty follow-up email.
Watched it get opened 30+ times via MailTrack.

Someone’s conscience got haunted.


Act III: Gaslight Tax & Chill
Position was listed as “Tax Coach.” I thought, cool—strategy, consulting, client interaction.
Nah. They just needed a 1040 Sweatshop Gremlin™ for the extension grind.
And once the deadline passed?
Eviction from the spreadsheet mines.
I declined the honor.


Act IV: LegalNightmare Wealth Partners
This one? Whew.
They weaponized the hiring process.
Used interviews like a discovery session for free labor.
Pulled out all the red flags, waved 'em like parade batons.
And now we're in a legal skirmish with plotlines fit for a courtroom drama.
Stay tuned.


Act V: HR Hunger Games
The rest was a montage of horror:

Recruiters who ghost harder than your middle school crush.
Hiring managers who open your follow-up emails like it’s their kink and never respond.
Companies that make you jump through 4 interviews, a technical test, a personality quiz, and a final boss round…
Just to say “We’re planning to hire in Q3.”
Sis. Why did you post the job then???


Moral of the Story?
I might be deeply unhinged, but at least I’m transparent, employed, and MailTrack certified.
And unlike some of these companies, I don’t need to fire three seasonal workers to afford coffee.

Job hunting in 2025 was a Hunger Games sequel with Excel spreadsheets and vibes.

There's a problem that I don't see getting much attention regarding fluid flow. There can be other problems but here I'm focusing on JUNCTIONS as they seem to be overlooked.  
  
Placing a junction on an existing pipe may cause a break in the pipe. You can see this by highlighting the pipe with the delete - the pipe should connect to the outer portion of the junction to function properly. If it connects to the center portion of the junction it might not flow. (But sometimes it will continue to work.)

Fix: Always delete and reconnect pipes at junctions where the junction was placed onto an existing pipe.

It was dark, chopped up, and had zero usable counter for anything besides a cutting board.

  
Progress photos: 1) before shots of the narrow galley and the weird half wall, 2) demo with the wall opened, 3) framing/patching and electrical rough-in, 4) cabinet install, 5) countertop and backsplash, 6) finished coffee bar + final wide shots.

  
What I did:

\- Pulled off the upper cabinets on one side and demoed a non-load-bearing half wall that boxed in the entry.

\- Relocated one outlet run and added two new countertop outlets (power off at the breaker, checked with a tester).

\- Built a shallow coffee bar cabinet run: base cabinets, a plywood top, and a small open shelf section.

\- Made the countertop from laminated birch plywood with a hardwood edge band, then sealed it with multiple coats of water-resistant finish.

\- Added a simple tile backsplash and grouted/sealed it.

  
Materials/tools: base cabinets, 3/4 in plywood, hardwood edge strip, tile, thinset, grout, outlet boxes/wire, level, circular saw, oscillating tool, tile saw.

  
Time and cost: about 4 weekends, roughly mid-range budget.

  
Challenges: getting the countertop dead flat (shimmed bases carefully) and matching the wall texture after removing the half wall.

I'm looking to finally visit Asia for the first time and want to do Vietnam before I tackle China, Malaysia and Singapore next year. I have a 2 week itinerary in my mind but just wanted any advice for those who have been before and if I replace or swap or even add anything!:

Days 1–2 – Hanoi

* Old Quarter, food, coffee culture
* Hoan Kiem, Train Street, museums
* Recover from jet lag

Day 3 – Ninh Binh day tour

* Trang An / Tam Coc + Hoa Lu
* Back to Hanoi in the evening

Days 4–5 – Ha Long Bay (2D1N cruise - I'm open to remove this in case it's best to see more of Hanoi) 

* Depart Hanoi morning Day 4
* Overnight on boat
* Return Hanoi afternoon Day 5

Day 6 – Hanoi (buffer / chill day)

* Anything I haven't done in Day 1-2 depending on when my flight arrives.

 Day 7 – Fly Hanoi → Da Nang

Days 7–9 – Da Nang & Hoi An

* Marble Mountains (Might do one of the packed day tours)
* Hoi An Old Town, lanterns, tailor

Day 10 – Fly Da Nang → Ho Chi Minh City

Days 10–13 – Ho Chi Minh City

* War Remnants, Cu Chi Tunnels
* Optional Mekong Delta day trip
* Relax and explore

Day 14 – Departure back to Ireland

  
This is a very \*rough\* plan but from a couple of days researching here and there for things to see this is what I've come up with. Note I am more than okay with the ""running around"" vibes with the day tours and packed schedules, I like the sense of doing a lot and not really relaxing and taking it slow haha, but I understand if some is genuinely impossible and I should sacrifice one thing or not.

The Ha Long Bay cruise I keep seeing mixed opinions about it given Ninh Binh offers a similar experience with the beautiful mountains but also the historical sites which I am very interested in. So advice on that would be great too please!

The only black mark is from me emotionally cheating online 4 years ago. She has never admitted to/done/been caught doing anything and I have never slept around. 

A few months ago I decided to stop using social media and also to try and put my phone down a lot more often. I began to notice how often my wife was on her phone now that I was not on mine. Most of her usage did seem benign like mindless scrolling. But then there were times when it did not look like that at all. She would reposition her body if we were sitting on the couch next to each other. She would stare like in a trance at her phone. Then the worst part… the thumbs going back and forth repeatedly without the audible “text sent” ding. It was not a text she was writing.

Ok this goes on for a week or two. I also begin to notice that she was wearing her apple watch way more often than she used to… like way more. Maybe I just didn’t notice it before how much she wore it… but now it was on her wrist at 8 pm on the couch. She would look at her watch and either clear the notification or it would prompt her to begin using her phone, in a manner where I could not see the screen.

My suspicions begin to mount when her work holiday party came up. In the 10 years she has worked there, I have never been to a work function. Every holiday party that comes up, either she goes alone or we both stay home. She went to the last party 6 months ago alone, which was unusual for her since she never goes to those. I figured now she is going to go since she went last time. She tells me on Monday that she is planning on going (it is on Friday). I immediately tell her that I want to join her and go as a couple. She is hesitant… but does not cancel right away.

Friday rolls around and we are still going to the party Friday morning. She gets home from work and now we are not going any longer. It just felt odd to me that she wouldn’t go to a work function with me. I just didn’t feel good. And sure, it could be just a coincidence and she wasn’t even thinking about that aspect and truly didn’t want to go at the last minute.

But then there is the other few times I have surprised her at work. Plain and simple, I was not welcome. It was a glaring message with her eyes… get the F out of here… don’t come here. So I left and stopped doing drop ins as they were not appreciated.

Now I am full on suspect of her chatting with someone online. I for whatever reason, believe it is Instagram and begin watching her use that app. I do not use Instagram so I don’t know how the app works or how it looks etc… But after a few days, I do notice that she seems to always have unread messages on the “paper airplane” app icon.

I know the password to her phone, but have made a choice to not go through it over a decade ago, so I won’t do that. But I do ask her to show me her app and what is up with the unread messages. She plays total stupidity and acts like she can’t even FIND the messages section… says she never uses it. I google it and say its that paper airplane and she clicks it. There are like lists and lists of names in here. She has like a dozen chats open at least. She knows what a message is. She claims all of these are from the people she follows that when they go live, she gets a DM. Whatever, we drop it and move on. I am still suspicious. I download Instagram and start using it to figure it out. It shows me exactly when she logs on! Interesting.

One of the other things that she has been doing lately is bringing her phone with her everywhere. Going to the bathroom for a potty? Yep, bring the phone. Downstairs to check the oven? Bring the phone. Check the mail? Bring the phone. It cannot be more than arms length. I know this feeling because years ago, I myself was emotionally cheating online with someone.

So yes, some of this could be projection since I did actually do this to her a while ago. I know what it was like to hide my phone and to always keep it with me… setting it down screen side facing down, never up.

I start watching her to see when she leaves the room abruptly and takes her phone. I decide to start watching when she logs onto Instagram instantly when leaving the room she was in with me. And boom, she does it… she just went downstairs and I can hear her banging pots and pans around with the oven. Then it gets a little quiet… I check and yes, she is on Instagram. So I quickly make my way downstairs to try and catch her.

When I get there, I begin scanning the room/counter top for her phone because I should see it open to Instagram. Nope, I can’t find it. I ask, where is your phone? And she says “I need to set a timer” and begins to grab it out of her pocket. I begin to panic/cry and say oh no, why is it in your pocket? You were just on Instagram… why is your phone in your pocket? And all she can say is… I need to set a timer. I ask her, were you just on Instagram? She says no. I say, when was the last time you were on Instagram? And she says upstairs with you. Nope. That cannot be unless Instagram told me she was online when she wasn’t.

A few minutes go by and she says, oh yeah, I was on Instagram, I checked it when I got down here to see if the message you sent me had arrived. I had been sending her messages to see how the DM system worked etc. I say let me see your inbox and she goes to the inbox and deletes a message. She says the message is junk and even says something like “you watched me delete it” which I did see her do something, but I couldn’t read it from where I was.

I begin googling about how to get deleted messages back and come across the Instagram data download that will give us account details, that may include information about deleted messages. She says, ""I didn’t know you could do that” and then in like a minute, she deletes the app and throws her phone. She throws her phone. Throughout this whole time, she is seriously angry with me. Her dominant emotion here, is anger.

I ask her to retrieve her stuff and reinstall the app, so we can get the data download. The data download comes back and says that she has participated in “secret conversations” on her device and that it last occurred at the moment she deleted that message in front of me. Exact timestamp as I have a reference on my phone to a text I had sent.

I google what that means and it is not quite clear. It could mean that she is exchanging encrypted messages (not just receive, but she has to send them too) or that Instagram just says that to everyone whether they are using the encrypted chats or not. I infer that she was in fact using the encrypted chats. There was only two records of secret conversations in the data dump. She says, lets get a year and we redo the download. On this one, the same thing is there, only two records of secret conversations… I go on to learn that this is only the most recent timestamp of the device you used to access your accounts DMs. That is just about it. So it would be the same with either 1 day or 1 year data pull. One record for each device you use to access your chats.

For whatever reason, we move onto facebook/messenger. I reactivate my deleted facebook account and begin to stalk her profile. I do not like what I find. In the context of what I have been noticing and feeling, it makes me sick to my stomach. The first red flag. She changed her profile pic to a beautiful selfie of just her face a few months ago. Now I was with her on that day and she had several selfies of the two of us with the same background she could have chosen. She has NEVER ever had a profile pic with just her face. It has always been either a close up of the two of us, or a zoomed out pic of her in a landscape.

This one is hard to digest. Yes it could be totally benign. But it looks really bad from this angle to me, the jealous husband. Second red flag is that she has a new FB friend from work and he is single. He is active too. He reacts to every post she makes. She reacts to at least some of his posts (I can’t see if it was all because he unfriended her and deleted content). The absolute worst part was my wife’s last valentines day post. It had a heart on it and he hearted her heart, on valentines day.

Oh why couldn’t I have been ON FACEBOOK and seen this happen in real time? Am I reading too much into that action? The public action of his reacting a heart on her posted pic of a heart on valentines day? From a single man to a married woman? They work together daily. She has brought his name up in my house more than 5 times in the last year. I know about this mans family because she has told me.

Based on this, we do a facebook data download and when it comes back it had a lot to digest. It had this section for “stickers used” which had to come from creating an avatar. It looks like you can get the stickers used without actually using the stickers… but you DO HAVE to create an avatar to get them. She for sure created her avatar. There is a saved date too for creating it and that was February 18^(th) 8:30 pm. Four days after the valentines day hearting action. Her quantity of stickers used on the first download was extremely high, like almost 700. When I did mine, it loaded 90 as the default for an account that created an avatar, but then didn’t use it.

She claimed at first that she never made that avatar, nor used it in the chats. Then I watched her delete that avatar and create a different one. At this point she does admit to accidentally creating it but still claims that she hadn’t used it.

Facebook also says that she participated in “secret conversations” that last ended the day before at a time, when she was not using her phone (or so it appeared). That day she had set her phone on the coffee table upstairs for hours and hours and hours. Basically all day it sat there. But then at some point, facebook (and her iphone battery app) logs that it went onto facebook messenger for 2.5 minutes at 6:51 pm. It doesn’t say if she sent or received messages… but the app was open to the front screen and it was active. 2.5 minutes is a long time and cannot be an accident because screens time off after like 10 seconds.

She says it wasn’t her using it and the data is wrong.

I ask to go through her facebook account and everytime we click “new message” the top suggestion, is that guy from work, lets call him Gary. Why does facebook keep suggesting to her that she should message Gary? I google that list priorty and facebook says its an algorithm that is trying to rank your top engagement people. So for instance, if you were DMing back and forth a lot, you would be top connected. Or if you were fanboying someones profile for hours and always liking their content… that can sway it too. So him being at the top, doesn’t mean she is guilty, because he can fanboy her page and get himself to the top of her list technically speaking.

I decide to go to her work and confront this man and ask him if he is talking to my wife. It is a bit dramatic, but it is what it is. She says I can go and it won’t be weird and we can sell it like I am helping the office out since I am off of work that day. I ask her to not warn him that I am coming because he gets there like 3 hours after her. Some days, he does call in off so we don’t know if he is coming in for sure today. But around 8, she gets a phone call and is notified that he is in fact, coming to work today. She leans in to tell me that, and I have to admit, her emotions in this moment strike me as odd… *it is giddy, like pure excitement*. It really caught me off guard.

I forgot to mention that for like a decade, the both of us just don’t wear our wedding rings. I started it because It was uncomfortable and just never put it back on. I didn’t care she didn’t wear hers because I wasn’t wearing mine. Also, I just knew she wouldn’t cheat on me. But then I emotionally cheated on her (not physically) and maybe that changed everything for her, or maybe it was changed before that too as I didn’t treat her very well. I was an alcoholic and severely took her for granted and straight up didn’t appreciate her, nor treat her how she deserved to be treated, for over a decade.  

So this morning, I asked her to get my ring (since she put it in her jewelry box). I was crying and saying that me not wearing it was sending the wrong message and that I need to be wearing it to show we are happily married. She is sitting there holding like 2 of her old rings and mine and she asks if I want her to wear hers… I say she can do what she wants and I don’t want to control her. She does NOT put her ring on. This absolutely breaks me in the moment and I break down crying harder.

We get to work and the morning goes well with me helping around the office. Gary arrives and it is like a setup… my wife quickly comes to me and says “he’s here” and she walks away out of the office. I am now alone in the office with this man and am, according to the plan, supposed to stop him and ask him to go outside. What plan? Who made this plan? I know I didn’t. sounds like something she came up with either Gary or her coworkers, which was discussed without me. Well I don’t do their plan and let Gary continue walking through the office and he goes into the back where my wife was. I can’t hear them and give them a few seconds as I don’t want to be intrusive.

I go back there soon and say good morning, and ask him if he will talk to me outside. He says yes and follows me. When we get out there, I say do you know that she is married? I know she doesn’t wear a ring, but she is married. That is my wife. She is my wife. I tell him that I am going through a jealous fit of rage and that I found something in my wife’s phone that led me to him. He says, what me, or a Gary? There are a lot of other Garys… I say, no, you Gary and point to his name tag. I ask him if he is talking to my wife. He says no. I ask him if he would do me the kindness of proving that. He says yes and gets his phone out.

I ask him to start typing in her phone number and after 6 digits two names pop up and my son’s name is at the top. MY SON. The second name I don’t recognize and am so flabbergasted about my son’s info being in his phone that I look him in the eye and say I don’t like this. What is this? He explains the story (which my son had already told me a few months ago about Gary wanting to buy my son’s scooter, so I guess I already knew this and I didn’t like it when I heard it from my son and chalked it up to some weird coworker of my wife). I say and I quote “what are you trying to be the cool stepdad here talking to my son and my wife?” He says he is not talking to either.

I ask him to open up Instagram and I want to see if he has a chat open with my wife. He does not. I ask him to go to the search and to start typing in her name. Nothing comes up. Which is what I wanted to see in the moment… I thought that if she popped up at the top that would mean they were chatting and it was just deleted… so when her name never showed up in any list while searching for the first 4 characters of her name… I was happy.

Little did I know that isn’t what I wanted to see. I should have seen her name there. The fact that she didn’t show up in the search, meant she was blocked from his account, to prevent her from showing up in the search. How do I know this? Well, facebook and istagram are the same company. When your accounts are linked, they know who your facebook friends are and will start suggesting those to you on your Instagram. In the process of us going through my wifes phone, her facebook and instagram got accidentally linked the day before my interaction with Gary.

My wife and Gary are facebook friends. Gary’s Instagram would have KNOWN my wife’s Instagram account and would have been suggesting that to Gary, so when he began searching for her name, it would have popped up at the top. I know this because on my new Instagram account, that is how the recommends are showing up. I’m getting all of my friends on facebook and their friends’ Instagram’s are showing up on mine as suggestions. In addition, on my wifes phone when I search for Gary, he does show up in the search results. Why would my wife not show up on his search results? Their accounts on Facebook were connected… she should have been a top recommend to him. I see Gary every day on my Instagram and I have only ever searched for him once. I clicked on his account and saw it was private. Then I never went back. I see his account every day as a recommend. There are 3 or 4 letters of the alphabet that when I start typing… his name shows up first with each of those letters only. For example, a “G” will prompt it… a “Y” will prompt it… but on his phone, I typed my wifes entire first name out… nothing.

Anyways, after our talk I tell Gary that I believe him and go back inside. I had to say this regardless because my wife asked me not to make a scene, to which I said ok and decided to leave on happy terms regardless of mine and Gary’s interaction. When I get inside, she gives me a look and questioning face, “how did it go” and she says it nervously. I give her the thumbs up and leave immediately.

Since then my wife has been super open with her phone offering me to go through it, which I have a few times in front of her but didn’t find anything. I have not looked into her phone without her present though as I am not going to do that. I was looking for secret apps, whatsapp, stuff like that but couldn’t find anything.

She says she hasn’t been doing anything. I say then stop throwing red flags. She asks which ones? I say well I don’t ever want to come into a room and see you looking at your phone home screen… or see that you JUST opened an app. Just like the second I walked in the room. She says, yeah that looks suspicious and won’t do that.

Well last night was the third time I saw her do that in the last week. I didn’t even say anything at first… she saw that I saw her looking at nothing and questioned why I was concerned. I say because you are hiding something… you just closed whatever it was you were doing to open up your email app and are at the top none the less… not reading one… not scrolling it. The top. She says that was just a coincidence and she opens her email all the time during the day.

One other thing that kind of bothered me in hindsight is that when this happened I had begun to stay close to her and I guess try to monitor her and keep glancing at her phone screen every few minutes. After like 3 days of this, I decided to leave the house for several hours… maybe 4 and when I got home, she had to immediately take a shower. She says it is because she was dirty from cleaning the house, which could of course be true. I just gotta say, that felt weird in the moment. In addition to that, I thought I smelt latex once on her inner upper thighs recently… but I have a bad sense of smell and that could have all entirely been jealously projection… I am not an expert in smells. In fact, I didn’t even bring it up that day and just continued with our love making.

Full disclosure I am not great in bed. I don’t get super hard erections and typically will need to use oral (which I do actually enjoy though) to bring her to climax. Lately, I have been struggling with a bit of ED as well, so this has exacerbated these feelings of lack. This could lead into me being self conscious about her wanting someone better, which then leads to these thoughts I am having now.

another thing, throughout these two weeks and our fights, she has struck me in the face twice. Her overall emotional state in this, is anger. to me, that reads like guilt but I am not an expert.

btw, Gary looks like someone to be jealous of from my perspective. As a man, he looks like to me what a lot of women would want. 

to sum up the situation that I am imagining is this: Gary shows his feelings for my wife on Feb 14. They begin chatting. she makes an avatar Feb 18. A few months later she changes her profile pic to only her face, something she has never ever done. The switch over to chat on instagram. I catch her using instagram and then she switches back to facebook messenger that day for 2.5 minutes. That is the day before I went in. She can't have me at the holiday party with her because Gary will be there. 

Thanks for reading!

I'm looking to finally visit Asia for the first time and want to do Vietnam before I tackle China, Malaysia and Singapore next year. I have a 2 week itinerary in my mind but just wanted any advice for those who have been before and if I replace or swap or even add anything!:

Days 1–2 – Hanoi

* Old Quarter, food, coffee culture
* Hoan Kiem, Train Street, museums
* Recover from jet lag

Day 3 – Ninh Binh day tour

* Trang An / Tam Coc + Hoa Lu
* Back to Hanoi in the evening

Days 4–5 – Ha Long Bay (2D1N cruise - I'm open to remove this in case it's best to see more of Hanoi) 

* Depart Hanoi morning Day 4
* Overnight on boat
* Return Hanoi afternoon Day 5

Day 6 – Hanoi (buffer / chill day)

* Anything I haven't done in Day 1-2 depending on when my flight arrives.

 Day 7 – Fly Hanoi → Da Nang

Days 7–9 – Da Nang & Hoi An

* Marble Mountains (Might do one of the packed day tours)
* Hoi An Old Town, lanterns, tailor

Day 10 – Fly Da Nang → Ho Chi Minh City

Days 10–13 – Ho Chi Minh City

* War Remnants, Cu Chi Tunnels
* Optional Mekong Delta day trip
* Relax and explore

Day 14 – Departure back to Ireland

  
This is a very \*rough\* plan but from a couple of days researching here and there for things to see this is what I've come up with. Note I am more than okay with the ""running around"" vibes with the day tours and packed schedules, I like the sense of doing a lot and not really relaxing and taking it slow haha, but I understand if some is genuinely impossible and I should sacrifice one thing or not.

The Ha Long Bay cruise I keep seeing mixed opinions about it given Ninh Binh offers a similar experience with the beautiful mountains but also the historical sites which I am very interested in. So advice on that would be great too please!

Thank you!",1,1767364136.0,travel,1,1.0,False
