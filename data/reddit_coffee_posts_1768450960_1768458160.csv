1qdc148,https://www.reddit.com/r/warthundermemes/comments/1qdc148/want_to_seek_purpose_of_life/,want to seek purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night. U.S. but I'm a night 🦉 Why I'm posting here 😂","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

My shirts and my mobile backgrounds.

Thoughts?","So i decided my priority is to just get people to play my games, making them free is the ultimate zero barrier to entry, and my plan is to just have a little ""heart"" button in the main menu, when you tap it it shows a text saying basically 

""THANK YOU FOR PLAYING 'INSERT GAME TITLE'  
Check out our other games or Show Support by clicking below""

And it'll just be a circular button with my company logo leading to my website, and at top right will be an X button to close out the window.

The reason i wanna do this versus directly going to my website is that whenever i order anything and receive a package, if there's a little note inside saying ""thank you"" even if its generic looking, it does make me feel a little bit something nice inside.

And when people do play my game, even if it's for free, i do genuinely feel thankful so it feels right to say thank you for your precious time even if its just a few minutes to check out my game even if you don't give me a dime for it.

But the option is always there as a Buy me a Coffee button on my website which is big and clearly visible if you click the button to visit.

1qdbykb,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1qdbykb/not_scammed_by_3rd_party_seller_just_vexed/,"Not scammed by 3rd party seller, just vexed","I rarely buy from third-party sellers, except for used books - IF I find a seller with ratings in the 90s.

I ran across an out of production item I wanted at a decent price from a high 80s rated west coast storefront with a number of 'meh' listings.

The USPS reported delivering the item Dec 23rd, a week after it was sent. Knowing our alternate carriers occasionally get ahead of themselves in scanning, I was patient. 

After the holidays, it still hadn't arrived, so I finally inquired at my local post office, I was told the address on the package was not mine. The clerk said 3-4 other customers had reported the very same problem that day.

The seller's stubbornly defensive response was basically ""not my problem"". When it finally occurred to me to look up the tracking number on the USPS site, I discovered the label included no street address at all.

The seller said it was sent to the address I provided - as if Amazon lets buyers establish accounts with incomplete addresses.

Now, any number of things could have happened to the label before/during shipment. The printer mis-fed or smeared it. It was placed across a seam and tore. A stray piece of tape pulled part of it off, leaving only the bar code. Coffee got spilled on it. Rain dissolved part of it. The dog chewed it.  I figure that's likelier than Amazon omitting what is arguably the most critical part of the address.

Amazon is refunding my money, but the perspective only age and experiencd can bring insists I sound an alarm and preach a little.

Over decades, we have been seduced by technology. A worker in a small operation doesn't need to look at the labels he slaps on. Disengaged, he runs on auto-pilot. We are totally reliant on a network of machines that require no thought, only following the standards we are given. Recommendations are supplied for everything from how often to clear out our pantry to how to ""be authentic"" (a classic example of unclear on the concept).

""Advancement"" and ""progress"" boost the economy, but on the wrong end. Human beings need to learn to do for ourselves and each other by reclaiming the skills of our ancestors.

Formal training is only available for trades that industries now rely on (electrician, HVAC, phlebotomist) and rarely for those made obsolete by items that are only affordable because they are mass produced in distant countries, trades like carpentry, cabinetmaking, masonry, horticulture, carpentry, food production and preservation, tailoring, ANY kind of repair, and in case I didn't mention it, carpentry.

To do those, our children and grandchildren need as much of a classic education as they can get. It teaches us to THINK, and that teaches us how to learn, a lifetime skill. Job training based on speculations derived from HR surveys only guarantees corporations a large pool of entry level applicants for positions they MAY have, at least for a while (not that anything is more fulfilling than careers in corporate/nonprofit industries 😉).

Our leaders' long time habit of incurring ever more debt to ""maintain the confidence"" of current - insatiable - investors locks future generations into perpetual servitude. Any observant person who has studied history knows this was never sustainable. Now a sea change is upon us, and with a ""least possible effort"" default mode, it's gonna be bleak.

The vase handbag trend brings together fashion-inspired design and contemporary home décor. By transforming the shape of a luxury accessory into a functional decorative object, these vases add personality and style to modern interiors. Their sculptural form makes them stand out in any space.

A [**designer bag vase**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) offers more than just a place for flowers. It serves as a statement piece that reflects creativity, elegance, and an appreciation for fashion aesthetics. Whether displayed on shelves, coffee tables, or entryway consoles, it instantly elevates the overall décor.

The appeal of a handbag shaped vase lies in its unique silhouette. Inspired by iconic handbag designs, this type of vase combines structure and softness in a visually striking way. It works well as both a decorative object and a functional container for fresh or preserved flowers.

Many interior stylists prefer [**vase handbag**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) designs because they bridge the gap between art and lifestyle décor. These pieces often require no additional styling, as their form alone creates visual impact. This makes them ideal for minimalist interiors that focus on statement accents.

A well-crafted designer bag vase highlights attention to detail, from clean lines to balanced proportions. High-quality finishes ensure the vase complements both modern and luxury-inspired interiors. These features make handbag vases popular as premium décor gifts.

The versatility of a [**handbag shaped vase**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) allows it to suit a wide range of décor styles. It pairs beautifully with neutral interiors as well as bold, eclectic spaces. The design adapts easily, whether used as a centerpiece or an accent piece.

Smaller décor items such as small coloured vases are ideal for compact spaces. They add charm and character without overwhelming the room. When combined with handbag-inspired designs, these vases deliver both style and functionality in a compact form.

Choosing [**small coloured vases**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) allows homeowners to experiment with colour and texture. Soft pastels create a subtle look, while vibrant hues bring energy and contrast to interior spaces. These vases work well in clusters or as standalone accents.

A vase handbag design also fits well into curated décor collections. Its fashion-forward shape complements modern art pieces, coffee table books, and sculptural accessories. This creates a cohesive and thoughtfully styled environment.

With its blend of fashion influence and artistic expression, the designer bag vase represents a new direction in home styling. Whether displayed as a handbag shaped vase or styled among small coloured vases, it offers a refined yet playful approach to modern interior décor.",1,1768457727.0,u_FutureOpposite7104,0,1.0,False

The tech sector is facing a double-edged sword of geopolitical headwinds today as the US imposes new tariffs on advanced chips while China retaliates against Western software leading to immediate volatility. Tensions are escalating, and major cap stocks are feeling the immediate impact of this trade war acceleration.

**The Market Moves:**

*   **Chip Wars:** **Nvidia (NVDA)** and **AMD** are grappling with new **25% US tariffs** on high-performance chips like the H200 and MI325X.
*   **Meta Pivot:** **Meta Platforms (META)** announced over **1,000 layoffs** in its Reality Labs division, shifting resources from the metaverse to AI wearables.
*   **Broadcom (AVGO):** Shares slid **5%** after reports that China is restricting domestic companies from using US/Israeli cybersecurity software.
*   **Other Movers:** **Coca-Cola (KO)** halted its £2B sale of Costa Coffee due to low bids, while **Honeywell (HON)** is advancing a Quantinuum IPO playing for a **$10 billion** valuation.

*Why it matters:* The simultaneous hit of tariffs and foreign restrictions highlights the fragility of the global semiconductor supply chain in 2026. Furthermore, Meta's pivot signals that even deep-pocketed tech giants are losing patience with the ""metaverse"" money pit, prioritizing the immediate monetization potential of AI hardware instead.

**Discussion:** Do you think the new 25% chip tariffs will significantly dent Nvidia's margins, or is the demand for AI compute strong enough to pass these costs onto customers?

Der Technologiesektor steht heute vor einem zweischneidigen Schwert geopolitischer Gegenwinde: Die USA verhängen neue Zölle auf Hochleistungschips, während China im Gegenzug westliche Software einschränkt — das sorgt sofort für Volatilität. Die Spannungen eskalieren, und große Blue Chips spüren die unmittelbaren Folgen dieser beschleunigten Handelsspannungen.

**Die Marktbewegungen:**

*   **Chip-Krieg:** **Nvidia (NVDA)** und **AMD** kämpfen mit neuen **25% US-Zöllen** auf Hochleistungschips wie die H200 und MI325X.
*   **Meta-Strategiewechsel:** **Meta Platforms (META)** kündigte über **1.000 Entlassungen** in seiner Reality Labs-Abteilung an und verlagert Ressourcen vom Metaverse hin zu KI-Wearables.
*   **Broadcom (AVGO):** Die Aktien fielen um **5%**, nachdem bekannt wurde, dass China heimische Unternehmen beim Einsatz von US-/israelischer Cybersicherheitssoftware einschränkt.
*   **Weitere Bewegungen:** **Coca-Cola (KO)** stoppte den Verkauf von Costa Coffee im Wert von 2 Mrd. £ wegen zu niedriger Gebote, während **Honeywell (HON)** den Börsengang von Quantinuum vorantreibt und auf eine Bewertung von **10 Milliarden US-Dollar** setzt.

*Warum das wichtig ist:* Die gleichzeitigen Belastungen durch Zölle und ausländische Einschränkungen zeigen die Fragilität der weltweiten Halbleiter-Lieferkette im Jahr 2026. Zudem signalisiert Metas Strategiewechsel, dass selbst kapitalkräftige Tech-Giganten die Geduld mit dem ""Metaverse""-Geldgrab verlieren und stattdessen auf das unmittelbare Monetarisierungspotenzial von KI-Hardware setzen.

**Diskussion:** Glaubt ihr, dass die neuen 25% Zölle auf Chips Nvidias Margen deutlich schmälern werden — oder ist die Nachfrage nach KI-Compute so groß, dass diese Kosten an die Kunden weitergegeben werden?

1qdbu3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qdbu3a/never_go_blank_again_4_sciencebacked_jokes_that/,Never Go Blank Again: 4 Science-Backed Jokes That ACTUALLY Land,"I used to freeze up completely whenever someone said ""tell us something funny."" My mind would just... stop. Like a computer crashing. Meanwhile everyone's staring at me, waiting, and I'm internally screaming.

This kept happening at work events, dates, family dinners. Everywhere. I started avoiding social situations because the anxiety of potentially being put on the spot was unbearable. Felt pathetic honestly.

So I did what any desperate person would do. I studied this stuff. Watched stand up specials frame by frame. Read books on comedic timing. Listened to podcasts about humor psychology. Analyzed what made people laugh versus what made them cringe. Turns out there's actual science behind why certain jokes work universally.

Here's what I learned that changed everything.

**Timing matters way more than the actual joke**

Most people rush through jokes like they're apologizing for existing. Bad move. The pause before the punchline is where the magic happens. It builds tension. Makes people lean in. Dr. Robert Provine (neuroscientist who literally studied laughter for decades) found that pauses trigger anticipation in the brain, which amplifies the payoff.

Practice this. Tell a joke. Force yourself to pause for 2 full seconds before the punchline. Feels awkward at first. Works incredibly well once you get comfortable with the silence.

**The self deprecating opener**

""I'm not saying I'm lazy, but I consider it a productive day if I make it to the couch."" This format works because you're the target. Nobody feels attacked. You're signaling that you don't take yourself seriously. It's disarming.

You can adapt this to literally anything. Just follow the formula: ""I'm not saying [negative trait], but [absurd example proving that trait]."" The key is making the example ridiculous enough that it's obviously exaggerated. That's what makes it funny instead of just sad.

**The observational callback**

Notice something weird or specific about your current situation, point it out with a twist. ""Anyone else feel like office coffee tastes like someone already drank it once?"" Simple. Relatable. Everyone in that office will laugh because they've thought the same thing but never said it out loud.

This technique comes straight from Jerry Seinfeld's approach. He built an entire career on pointing out the absurdity of normal things. You're just observing reality through a slightly twisted lens. The book ""The Comedy Bible"" by Judy Carter breaks this down brilliantly. She's coached tons of successful comedians and the book makes humor theory actually digestible. Not some academic snoozefest. Real practical tools you can use immediately.

**The unexpected comparison**

""My sleep schedule is like a conspiracy theory. Makes no sense but I'm fully committed to it."" This works because you're connecting two completely unrelated concepts. The brain has to work for half a second to make the connection, then it clicks and releases that dopamine hit.

Matthew Walker's research on sleep (he wrote ""Why We Sleep"") actually explains why sleep deprivation makes us less funny too. When you're tired, your prefrontal cortex basically stops working properly. That's the part responsible for creative thinking and making unusual connections. So if you want to be funnier, sleep more. Genuinely life changing book by the way. Will make you paranoid about your sleep habits in the best possible way.

**The absurd escalation**

Start with something normal, then escalate it to somewhere ridiculous. ""I meal prep on Sundays. Made 47 containers of chicken and rice. My fridge looks like I'm preparing for the apocalypse. Or a very specific natural disaster that only affects chicken and rice.""

The escalation is what gets people. You set up an expectation (normal meal prep) then shatter it (apocalypse bunker). This pattern interruption is what triggers laughter according to humor research. Your brain expects A, gets Z instead, releases happy chemicals.

**Practice in low stakes environments first**

Don't test new material at your company presentation or meeting your partner's parents. Try it on cashiers. Uber drivers. Random people who won't remember you in 10 minutes. You need repetitions to build confidence. The podcast ""The Hilarious World of Depression"" (yes really) talks a lot about how comedians use humor as a coping mechanism and how they practice constantly in everyday situations.

BeFreed is an AI learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it generates adaptive learning plans tailored to your goals, whether that's improving social skills, understanding comedy psychology, or becoming more confident in conversations.

The depth control is pretty useful. Start with a quick 10 minute overview of a topic, and if it clicks, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples and context. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can ask questions mid podcast or get book recommendations from. It covers all the books mentioned above and connects insights across multiple sources, so instead of reading five separate books on communication and humor, it synthesizes the key patterns for you. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous learning without the usual time commitment.

**The real secret nobody tells you**

Confidence sells the joke more than the joke itself. You can deliver mediocre material with conviction and people will laugh. Or you can tell genuinely funny stuff while apologizing for it and get crickets. Commit fully. Even if it bombs, own it. ""Well that landed worse than I expected"" is itself funny if you say it with confidence.

Also some people just won't laugh at anything and that's their problem, not yours. You're not performing for them anyway.

The goal isn't becoming a comedian. It's having a few reliable tools so you never feel completely helpless in social situations again. That fear of going blank, of disappointing people, of being boring. It doesn't have to control you.

These jokes won't make you the funniest person alive. But they'll get you through awkward elevator rides and uncomfortable silences. That's honestly good enough for most of us.",2,1768457497.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night. U.S. but I'm a night 🦉 Why I'm posting here 😂","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

Overall I think things were great. We prioritized rides and my daughter really enjoyed all of them. We did rider switch for a couple. I began the day by getting an Indiana LL and just kept modifying it back, which worked out well. I had been watching the Disney app for several days before the trip and noticed which LLs tended to go first versus to be available essentially immediately through the day. So we were strategic about leaving those quick/easy ones to a block near the end of the day so we could just book/ride/book/ride. And modifying as needed for the other rides. It worked out well. The main hitch was that at one point I had overlapping LLs and I had to switch things around. I somehow hadn't realized that the LLs can't overlap. Additionally, the runaway railroad broke down three times, twice while we were in line and once when we were about to go into the line after dinner. We almost didn't end up going but were able to push through exhaustion and tired feet and do it. We came from the East Coast yesterday so we have all been super exhausted (though getting up early for rope drop was a non issue). My daughter fell asleep around 7, probably. Food-wise, I wish I had been able to do some more special sweets but there were lines for so many things so we just kinda skipper that stuff. Next time! Very thankful for the LLMP because it made everything so much easier. Also for the ILL for Rise. With just one day at the park, I think these are a necessity. Favorite rides were definitely Indiana, Rise, Roger Rabbit shockingly, and Runaway Railway. So thankful for this full and crazy day!!! And thankful for all the info I gleaned on this community and elsewhere that helped our day be so full!",1,1768457474.0,Disneyland,1,1.0,False
1qdbttp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1qdbttp/i_made_the_mistake_of_staying_friends_and_its/,I made the mistake of staying friends and it’s eating me up,"I’m posting here because once again, I can’t sleep. Reading posts on this sub is the one thing that helps ground me and remind me everyone goes through similar emotions so I can manage too. 

For context, my ex (F24) and I (F28) broke things off during May 2023. It was a mutual decision following a big fight between her parents and ourselves. We both are into women and she was keeping our relationship a secret until her mother pressured her into admitting to dating me during my visit in her home country. We were LDR and had been together 3.5 years when her mother cornered us with the question “are you dating?” and when my ex revealed we were, we were given her mother’s blessing and asked to kiss. We thought everything was fine then but my ex later explained her father would not speak to her or even look at her. 

It escalated when we went out for coffee one afternoon after her shift and she forgot to warn her parents, they then urged us to come home and said we would have a conversation and sit together. 

During that conversation, which really was a forced intervention, her parents expressed disapproval towards our relationship, painted me as a bad partner who had hidden the relationship from them. My ex was blamed for introducing me only as a friend, for being intimate with me under their roof etc. When I began sobbing the situation worsened because I tried to explain I only wanted to respect my partner’s need to tell them about our couple when she would be ready —given they had been homophobic towards her in the past. This is when her parents took her aside and I was excluded from the talk. 

My ex explained they basically listed why I wouldn’t be a good partner for her. To sum it up they said my disability would ruin her life and that I was deceitful / a gold digger, that we weren’t in love because her mother could tell when looking at us we had mistaken friendship for love. 

Afterwards I was asked to leave their home and my ex was not allowed to drive me to the airport to see me off. That’s when we decided to break up.

To give you a timeline : 

\- 2023 May: Ex explains she will wait until her parents calm down and try to fix things because she wants to be together with me but not like this. 

\- 2023 November: We have been talking in secret because her parents forbid her to speak to me. She admits she has lost her feelings for me, I go into a depressive episode. She says she doesn’t feel like dating at all anymore.

\- Until September 2025: We remain friends but as time passes it seems my feelings for her are an inconvenience. She often gets very cold, refuses to see the conflict as homophobia and I talk about it less and less. I consider NC but she says she doesn’t want to lose me and still loves me as a friend. 

We have a big fight because she doesn’t like feeling like she has to treat me as more than a friend, I say I haven’t been trying to be romantic whatsoever the last couple of months and she snaps at me saying pretty harsh words. I go no contact. 

\- Early December 2025: I reach out. She admits to having regrets about our fight. I ask if she has been dating again, she avoids the question but admits she has been. I say I wish she had told me directly, she says she didn’t want to hurt my feelings. I explain NC is the best option for me and she understands. She said She didn’t reach out because it seemed I wanted to be left alone, that dating again she could ‘move on.’ Though she had said she had moved on months before that.

This is it. Ever since then I have been trying to stick to NC but I think about her all of the time. It’s not just my feelings for her, it’s anger and sadness too. I guess maybe because I stayed friends instead of straight up cutting ties but it’s eating at me. Especially because I thought she wasn’t feeling like dating but I maybe would have a chance to try again, until she admitted it was me she didn’t want to be with and she did want to date people.

Ultimately I felt used. I feel, being the one able to reach out for clearing the air I was never important— although she made that big speech about me being a part of her or something. Anyway. I say I made a mistake because it’s on me for staying friends, for not catching a clue when being told she wasn’t in love with me anymore. I stayed and basically held onto someone who did no want me.

I needed to vent so it would be out there and not inside my head anymore sorry. Thanks if you read all this. Have a lovely day. Hang in there. ",1,1768457474.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1qdbtos,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qdbtos/cousins_wife_repeatedly_crossed_boundaries_with_me/,Cousin's wife repeatedly crossed boundaries with me,"I (24M) am very close to my cousin’s wife (30F) we were like best friends and shared everything with each other. I trusted her completely, I used to drive her around to work and back and many places. Lately, her behavior became very strange and sexually inappropriate.

She started wearing explicitly revealing clothes around me, asking vulgar sexual questions, and behaving in sexually suggestive ways. She deliberately invaded my personal space. For example, while putting a cup of coffee on the table, instead of doing it normally, she leans over me and presses and rubs her boobs against my face.

She's flashed me and stood naked around me, more than two dozen times. I never asked for this, and each time felt weird. While I was taking a shower once, she tried to get in, stood outside the door for 15 to 20 minutes, knocking and asking me to open it to get something she left inside. I eventually opened the door, and it escalated into sexual contact. I refused more at the time, but the situation still included sexual acts. Later I felt regretful.

Later, things escalated even further. One night she came to me again, and despite my resistance, it escalated into sexual acts and eventually more. That was the first time it happened. I enjoyed it then, but immediately afterward I felt regret. This has happened more than four times. Every time, I felt worse afterward. I never wanted a relationship with her, never pursued her, and I hate that this happened. I feel regret for both her actions and mine to stop it sooner.

Her behavior is confusing because it only happens periodically, for a few days or a week at a time then she goes back to completely normal. As far as I know, she has only done this with me. I’ve completely cut off all contact. I don’t visit their home or call my cousin. He keeps asking why I dont call or visit, and I can’t even look him in the eye. I also feel sick being around them, whom I’m very close with. Every time I think about it, I feel like I’ve betrayed my cousin, even though I never wanted this and didn’t initiate it. I feel shame.",1,1768457463.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1qdbsrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UkFriends/comments/1qdbsrt/33f_its_late_at_night_here_see_if_there_are_any/,"33F. It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night. U.S. but I'm a night 🦉 Why I'm posting here 😂","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1qdbo79,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1qdbo79/how_fasting_actually_makes_you_focus_better_the/,How Fasting Actually Makes You FOCUS Better (The Science Behind It),"Okay, so you've probably heard that fasting is some miracle hack for focus and brain power. Maybe you've seen the influencers bragging about their 16-hour fasts or the productivity bros chugging black coffee at 2 PM saying they're ""in the zone."" But here's what nobody tells you: fasting isn't magic, and it doesn't work the same for everyone. The science behind how fasting impacts focus is actually super nuanced, and if you do it wrong, you'll just end up hangry and useless.

I've spent months diving into research from neuroscientists like Andrew Huberman, reading studies on metabolic states and cognitive performance, and testing different fasting protocols on myself. What I found surprised me. Fasting can genuinely sharpen your focus, but only if you understand what's actually happening in your brain and body. Let's break down the real science, no fluff.

 Step 1: Understand What Fasting Does to Your Brain

When you fast, your body goes through some serious metabolic shifts. After about 8-12 hours without food, your glycogen stores (stored carbs) start depleting. Your body then switches from burning glucose to burning fat, producing these molecules called ketones. And here's where it gets interesting: ketones are actually a super efficient fuel source for your brain.

Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast (Huberman Lab, highly recommend). He explains that when your brain runs on ketones instead of glucose, you often get this heightened state of alertness and focus. It's not just bro science. Research shows ketones can reduce oxidative stress in the brain and improve mitochondrial function, which basically means your brain cells work more efficiently.

But there's another factor at play: adrenaline and noradrenaline. When you're fasting, your body releases these stress hormones to keep you alert and energized so you can, you know, go hunt for food (from an evolutionary perspective). This bump in catecholamines is why many people report feeling super sharp and focused during a fast.

 Step 2: Timing Your Fast for Maximum Focus

Here's the thing nobody mentions enough: when you fast matters just as much as how long you fast. If you're trying to focus during the wrong window, you're going to have a bad time.

Morning fasts work differently than evening fasts. Most people naturally have higher cortisol and adrenaline in the morning, which is why skipping breakfast and extending your overnight fast can create this rocket fuel effect for focus. Your body's already primed for alertness, and fasting amplifies it.

If you want to maximize focus, try pushing your first meal to around noon or 1 PM. This gives you a solid 4-6 hour window in the morning where your brain is running on ketones and stress hormones. That's your golden window for deep work, complex problem solving, or anything that requires serious mental horsepower.

Pro tip from Huberman's work: If you drink black coffee or tea during your fast (no sugar, no cream), the caffeine synergizes with the fasting state to boost dopamine and acetylcholine, two neurotransmitters critical for focus and learning. It's like adding nitrous to an already fast car.

 Step 3: Don't Fast Too Long (You'll Crash Hard)

Alright, here's where people screw up. They think, ""If 16 hours is good, 24 hours must be better!"" Wrong. Dead wrong.

Extended fasts (beyond 18-20 hours for most people) can actually tank your cognitive performance. Once your body runs low on both glucose and readily available ketones, your brain starts running on fumes. You'll feel foggy, irritable, and unable to string coherent thoughts together. This is especially true if you're doing intense mental work or you're new to fasting.

The sweet spot for focus is usually 12-18 hours for most people. That's long enough to get into ketosis and experience the cognitive benefits, but not so long that you're depleting critical resources your brain needs.

Also, if you're doing hardcore exercise or your job is mentally demanding, you might need to shorten your fasting window. Everyone's different. Pay attention to how your body actually responds instead of following some random internet protocol blindly.

 Step 4: Break Your Fast Strategically

How you break your fast is just as important as the fast itself. If you've been running on ketones and adrenaline all morning and then slam a massive carb-heavy meal, your blood sugar will spike and then crash hard. Say goodbye to that laser focus you had.

Break your fast with protein and healthy fats first. This keeps your blood sugar stable and extends that focused, alert state. Think eggs, avocado, nuts, or salmon. Save the heavier carbs for later in the day when you don't need peak cognitive performance.

Huberman recommends eating your biggest, most carb-heavy meal in the evening. Carbs increase serotonin, which makes you feel calm and sleepy, perfect for winding down but terrible if you need to focus.

 Step 5: Know When Fasting Hurts Focus

Real talk: fasting isn't for everyone, and there are times when it will absolutely wreck your ability to focus.

If you're sleep deprived, fasting will make things worse, not better. Your brain needs glucose when it's already running on low battery from poor sleep. Combining sleep deprivation with fasting is like trying to drive a car with no gas and a broken engine.

If you're dealing with chronic stress or anxiety, extended fasting can amplify cortisol levels to unhealthy levels. You'll feel wired, jittery, and unable to focus. Not the vibe.

Women need to be especially careful. Hormonal cycles impact how women respond to fasting. During certain phases of your cycle, fasting can mess with your hormones and tank your focus instead of enhancing it. If you're a woman experimenting with fasting for focus, track how you feel during different weeks of your cycle.

 Step 6: Pair Fasting with Focus-Enhancing Habits

Fasting alone won't turn you into a productivity machine. You need to stack it with other habits that support focus:

 Cold exposure: Huberman is huge on this. A cold shower in the morning increases adrenaline and dopamine, which pairs perfectly with the fasting state for next-level alertness.  

 Morning sunlight: Getting direct sunlight in your eyes within an hour of waking sets your circadian rhythm and boosts cortisol at the right time. This makes your morning fasting window even more effective for focus.  

 Hydration with electrolytes: When you're fasting, you lose water and electrolytes faster. Drink water with a pinch of sea salt or use an electrolyte supplement (no sugar). Dehydration kills focus fast.

 Step 7: Track Your Response and Adjust

This is where most people fail. They try fasting once, feel like garbage, and quit. Or they feel amazing once and assume it'll always work the same way. Neither approach is smart.

Your response to fasting will change based on sleep, stress, activity level, and even what you ate the day before. Keep a simple log for a week or two. Note when you fasted, how long, how you felt, and how well you focused. You'll start seeing patterns.

Maybe you realize you focus best with a 14 hour fast but crash after 16 hours. Or maybe you discover that fasting on workout days wrecks you, but fasting on rest days is perfect. The data doesn't lie.

 Resources That Actually Helped Me Figure This Out

Huberman Lab Podcast: Seriously, if you're not listening to Andrew Huberman's podcast, you're missing out. His episodes on fasting, circadian biology, and optimizing focus are pure gold. The guy's a Stanford neuroscientist and breaks down complex science into stuff you can actually use. Episode on ""Time Restricted Eating"" is a must listen.

""The Circadian Code"" by Dr. Satchin Panda: This book changed how I think about when I eat, not just what I eat. Panda's research on circadian rhythms and time restricted eating is groundbreaking. This is the best book I've read on aligning your eating window with your biology. Insanely good read if you want to understand the science behind meal timing and brain function.

Zero app: I use this to track my fasts and see patterns over time. It's simple, clean, and helps you stay consistent without overthinking it. Plus it has built in articles explaining the science behind different fasting windows.

Look, fasting isn't some magic pill that'll suddenly make you a focus god. But when you understand the actual mechanisms, time it right, and pair it with other smart habits, it can genuinely give you an edge. Your brain runs differently when it's burning ketones instead of glucose. That's just biology.

The key is experimenting, tracking your results, and not being dogmatic about it. Some days you'll need food earlier. Some days you'll crush a 16 hour fast and feel unstoppable. Listen to your body, not some internet guru's one size fits all protocol.",2,1768456976.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

1qdbnc5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qdbnc5,Nymphs in new apartment,"I moved in 3 weeks ago.

Before I moved anything in, I did a deep clean and sprayed alpine wsg. I wiped out inside every cabinet and shelf and sprayed in there, moved out appliances, etc. 

I was coming from an apartment where I had a horrible ant infestation and I’d get adult Germans from my neighbor (3 in a year, successfully treated with alpine and Advion gel) so I wanted to do anything I could to prevent pests in the new place. 
During my cleaning I didn’t see any signs but there were a few bug traps under the washer and oven so I figured there had been pests at some point. I live in Hawai’i so it’s inevitable to have roaches at some point. 

11 days ago I saw 2 nymphs on the kitchen counter. Sprayed alpine. No signs again until tonight I found a dying nymph on the kitchen counter. 

What should I do next? I don’t want to overspray and build resistance. Should I use advion gel even if I haven’t seen any adults? I’m planning to spray every 2 or so weeks until no more sightings and then go 4-6 weeks after that. I do have a cat so treatment needs to be pet friendly 

I’m a clean freak. I wipe the counters of crumbs constantly, I don’t leave food out, I vacuum daily. I don’t a dishwasher, toaster, or microwave, and I clean my coffee machine after every single use. The oven is new and I just got a brand new washer two days ago. All of this to say, there aren’t many hiding spots for them but I’m still spooked. 

Should I be scared of 3 nymphs in 2 weeks? Treatment advice and positive ID would be helpful! TYIA!!

Currently one of the lucky contestants in this current application cycle, and hate to encroach on ur territory lol but have an important question I need insight on. I have received many surprising decisions and have options I did not expect, but a huge reality I’m needing to factor into my final decision is the accessibility of the school and its surrounding community. 

I have epilepsy, and am unable to drive. I have spent the last 4 years living in NYC so have been quite spoiled when it comes to public transit, but want to be clear I have no expectations to find that elsewhere and am honestly okay and maybe even preferring not having this. I would gladly give it up in exchange for getting to go to a school I feel is my top fit as long as it still felt livable. 

It should also be noted I’m not a big partier who loves going out a ton either. I’m quite introverted and a homebody and prefer small gatherings with a chill group of close friends, unplanned time in nature, or just staying in and reading over going to parties, a bar, or “hitting the town” etc. I also grew up in a mix of the mountains and countryside and miss the pace and nature every. single. day. I am more than okay not living in a bustling urban hub. BUT, I still need to be able to reasonably get groceries, get to doctor’s appointments and the airport with transit or ubers without paying a million dollars, and generally have access to things like coffee shops, a general store (walmart, target, etc type vibe) restaurants, maybe a bar - general civilization 🙃

I developed the seizures in undergrad, and my college was literally so isolated I couldn’t even get to the only supermarket available for 50 miles. There were no sidewalks, the roads were so poorly constructed, steep, and curved with blind spots that riding a bike was a death wish, there were no buses or shuttles, and ubers did not even bother coming to our town we were so out of the way. Not to mention, the campus was super small with everything closing at 7pm and all weekend. Safe to say I genuinely felt like I was on house arrest, and it did horrible things for my mental health and quality of life once my best friends with cars transferred or graduated. 

That is the situation I want to avoid repeating. 

Obviously schools in cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, DC, Boston, and NYC are fairly accessible and there are a fair share in considering - but I can’t help some of these other schools being dreams, some of them seeing like a better fit with their culture etc, and craving a change of pace and a return to more nature. 

So, to those of you in any of these law schools below - how is the accessibility? Is attending without having a car doable and even manageable, or would it be extremely isolated and difficult? Is there any public transit (including buses) to things like grocery stores or the nearest “town hub” (and I don’t mean a bustling downtown. just the place with shops, businesses, restaurants, bars, and in a dream world some other entertainment like parks). Is the terrain and traffic bikeable? Is the campus large enough and have enough available in and of itself staying near campus most of the week would be fulfilling still? Are there ubers and things like instacart available? 

\- University of Michigan

\- University of Wisconsin Madison 

\- Yale

\- UConn 

\- Wake Forest (seems unlikely)

\- University of New Hampshire (seems unlikely)

\- Quinnipiac University (seems unlikely)

Additionally, before this application cycle ends, if there is anyone who reads this and is thinking of their own law school that I didn’t mention fits the bill and it has good bar passage rates, employment rates, and offers some focus in criminal or public interest law - pls let a gal know!

Not even to be condescending, but a few months ago I didn’t even know what this term “demisexual” exactly even was! Now here I am thinking this is defining me to a T currently.

I’m a 20(M) 2nd year college student, and I’m here because I’ve been struggling really hard with dating, but not in the usual “no confidence / no social life” way.

To summarize: On paper, I’m doing great. I’m social, active on campus, have friends of all genders, get good grades, told I’m attractive, and I do get to know girls in real life. The issue is that I don’t feel romantic or sexual attraction quickly. I don’t look at someone and immediately think “I want her.” I usually need time, familiarity, comfort, emotional safety, and real conversation first. Only after knowing someone for a while (and not even forever, literally just a few weeks and a few interactions) do I start to feel anything beyond “this is a cool person, I like being around her and can see myself wanting more.”

Because of that, my pattern is:

1. Meet girl
2. Get along great
3. Slow build real comfort for both myself and her
4. Finally start to feel romantic interest
5. Then ask her out (and nothing crazy, just a one on one outing, a coffee, a dessert)
6. But by then she apparently already sees me as “safe friend guy” rather than someone to date

and rejects me

This is not just a once off thing, I’ve been rejected by EVERY girl in this exact manner.

Meanwhile the advice I keep getting is basically, “Show interest early, flirt fast, create tension, make a move before the moment dies,” but that just feels wrong to me. I don’t want to fake attraction I don’t feel yet. I don’t want to perform chemistry like it’s a script. I literally don’t know if I like someone romantically and want more until I’ve spent time with them. Acting like I do feels dishonest and uncomfortable.

So I guess my questions for this sub is:

1. Does this sound like demisexuality/demiromanticism?
2. Do any of you NOT feel attraction unless there’s trust, safety, and emotional connection first?
3. How do you date in a world where most people expect spark and flirting early?
4. How do you express interest without forcing fake sexual energy?

I’m not looking for hookup culture, games, or power dynamics. I like stability, warmth, mutual respect, reassurance, not risk and tension and “excitement”. I want a relationship where feelings develop naturally and slowly without pressure.

Would love to hear if this resonates with anyone here or if you’ve found ways to make dating work while being demi

1qdbkd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganinjapan/comments/1qdbkd1/coffee_shops_in_tokyo/,Coffee shops in Tokyo,"I want your recommendations for coffee shops and cafes in Tokyo that have vegan options for food. 

There are of course so many amazing coffee shops in Tokyo, and I love going to them often. However, the most they tend to offer in terms of veganism is alternative milk, with absolutely zero vegan food choices. For example, %Arabica or Streamer Coffee have decent coffee and nice eat in spaces, but nothing vegan to eat.

There are also so many great places with vegan baked goods and sweets, but so far all the ones I’ve visited really don’t offer decent coffee. I’m an ex barista and want proper coffee where the drinks are made well. For example, Ovgo Baker has really delicious sweets but their coffee is so bad… last time I went there, their hot latte was microwaved milk and pre-bottled latte base.🥲

Of the few places that almost fit my criteria, they’re only take out, with no eat in space where I can relax and enjoy my coffee and sweets. For example, I love the croissants from Tokyo Vegan Bakes, but they only have outdoor seating, which doesn’t really work in mid winter or summer. 

I just really want a nice cafe where I can enjoy a proper coffee WITH some sweets. An oat latte and a croissant while I sit and read my book is all I’m dreaming of. Please can anyone share your favourite spots if you know of anywhere. 

So far the only place I’ve found is Toriba Coffee, which is in Tokyo station. They have decent barista quality coffee, and most of their sweets are vegan. I find myself going there almost every week because it’s the only place I can enjoy both my coffee and some food.

This is just my perspective as another customer, I can’t even begin to imagine what the workers feel. Common sense is NOT that common apparently. It’s not hard to just be kind and respectful.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1qdbiop,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1qdbiop/is_it_selfish_or_am_i_suppose_to_feel_this_way/,Is it selfish or am I suppose to feel this way??,"Hi hi. So backstory i have a 6 month old baby. 

My husband has been wonderful and amazing but postpartum was getting to me 

I wanted to be perfect. Hence I slept at 11pm. And would wake up at 1am, 3am, 5 am and 6am. Those are my babies bed time feedings.
  
I tried my best to look after my baby and keep a somewhat clean house. I did ask my husband for help around the house during the work week because I felt like it was the fair thing to do since he was the one working. I grew exhausted. I woke up to cleaning whatever I didn’t get to clean the night before, cooking dinner ( which would also be his lunch) tending to the baby, and went the extra mile by “ getting ready” before he got home. That meant I did a quick body shower ( my hair was long. Half way down my butt) washing my hair and brushing would be a minimum of an hour  so I left hair washing days for the weekends. I’d put on some earrings, redo my hair into a nice bun and of course a little perfume. 

I eventually went back to work 4 months postpartum. Which made me even more exhausted. After work, I still did majority of the cleaning and cooking. I brushed it off as him having a more physical job and my job being more of a mental job. I was started to hate that fact that my baby was only able to fall asleep with me. I was disliking that she loved her dad but needed me more than him. Don’t get me wrong, he does cook and clean. But I have to constantly ask him or give him a todo list. He doesn’t get mad if I don’t cook nor clean. He has told me serval times he could care less if I haven’t showered or shaved my legs because he loves me and our baby is healthy. He tells me I’m pretty and he calls he says “ is the baby treating us to dinner tonight “ it’s his way of asking if he should get us dinner before coming home. 

 Half way in December, I just got tired of being tired. I woke up at 4am and I couldn’t go back to sleep so I took an everything shower. Baby was deep asleep so I was able to brush my hair and did my regular after shower routine before becoming a mom. When the baby woke up, we played, and “we” cleaned. When napped time arrived, I took a nap with her. We both woke up with extra energy and happy. I went grocery shopping and bought those processed foods (example : rice, mash potatoes, canned fried beans, mini packaged smashed avocados etc” 

All of these have been my quick meals because I’m lazy to cook. I made steak with mash potatoes and called it a day.  Asked him to help me clean and I nearly lost it when he only picked up his plate. I went off on him on how I’d pick up his too and other things.
Anyways, I’ve been leaving the dishes on the table and have told him
Those are his job now. And when he tries to help with the baby . I grab her and sooth her to sleep and it makes so happy that I know her so well.
It makes me happy how she smiles when I grab her. How we play before bedtime. How she touches my face before sleeping. How she immediately stops crying when I grab her. She falls asleep at 7:30pm. That’s her routine. Now, we both fall asleep at the same time and I don’t care if the kitchen is not left clean or if I have prep his lunch and left everything ready for him in the morning ( he wakes up at 4am to get ready for work and made it easier for him
By having the coffee ready. He cup
Would be waiting by coffee Machine. Snacks on the table ready to grab, Fruits sliced and packed on top of his lunch box so he wouldn’t forgot them. Yesterday, was the first time since December that I woke up early and made his coffee, cooked him
Breakfast and had his lunch backpack ready for him. He overslept so I woke him up. I knew he need the rest. He looked happy when he everything ready. 

Am I mean for being happy that my baby loves her dad but I love that her connection is stronger with me? Her dad even says she looks for me more and gets more excited to see me. 
And am I mean for not helping as much as I did before ? ",1,1768456486.0,venting,3,1.0,False
1qdbi2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qdbi2g/stuck/,Stuck,"*Recovered text file - Case* ███-██  
  
I grew up in a lovely townhouse in a small European town. The street is almost exclusively filled with the same paired houses. My mom was obsessed with decorating the front yard and my dad loved putting up lights, they did it for every event. The rest of the time though, it was bare, like our next door neighbors. I had never met or seen them but I was also a child, more so interested in my friends than some probably really old and isolated people.

Events like Easter, Halloween or my birthday were the only time my parents ever seemed normal. I never invited friends over due to the constant tension in the house. I assumed they must have still loved each other but love wasn’t enough to make them happy. They were always tired, uninterested, too busy to play with me. I distanced myself from them pretty early. I hung out with my friends so often that it became a habit for me to simply not come back home overnight, sometimes for several days. My parents didn’t seem to mind as long as I texted them once a day to let them know I hadn’t gotten kidnapped yet. No matter how long I managed to stay away though, without fail, as soon as I stepped on the property again, this overwhelming feeling of dread and the desperation to get away from the heavy silence rushed back to me.

When we got out of high school, my friends and I agreed we should get an apartment closer to the city for the three of us and so we did. After I moved out, I lost touch with my parents. They would never reach out and check up on me, it was exhausting trying to maintain the one-sided relationship. I let go and I still feel horrible about it. I loved them, but a part of me tells me it was the right thing to do. 

The three years I spent living with my two best friends were probably the best years of my life. Our different work schedules often made it hard to spend time together but when we did find a window? We had the best movie nights, went to the nicest bars, sometimes got too drunk to remember any of it but we took enough pictures that we probably didn’t need our minds anyway. Last year, we went to a Halloween party after they helped me face my parents since I wanted to visit them but didn’t feel up to it on my own. Honestly, besides the going-back-home part, it was the best night of my life. We danced to some of our favorite songs until sunrise. That time, I wasn’t drunk enough to forget the beauty in the starry sky and in the wild flames of the fire dancers.

Back then, after having proven false the theory that the transition between high school and real life tears apart all friend groups, I didn't think anything in the world could get in between us. I was dead wrong. Days after the party, one of my friends started dating some guy she met there and a few weeks later, the other began inviting one of her coworkers to our apartment. The only reason I found out was because I had walked in on them wrestling on the couch. I had forgotten to let her know my schedule had changed that day. To celebrate New Year’s, the first one officially moved in with her boyfriend and left us to recalculate how to divide the bills fairly.

Then my parents died.

She was trying to be gentle, but there is no way to be gentle about suggesting someone moves into the house their parents died in only a week after it happened. As much as I wanted to slap her, she was right and it wasn’t hard to guess she wanted to live with her boyfriend too. I reached the conclusion that it would overall be cheaper for me to move back into the old house rather than stay in this apartment by myself or find another one. The house was pretty far from my current job, so I talked to my manager and was able to start working from home. It wasn’t too hard to convince him, they were getting new hires and needed room anyway.

I have to admit, after all these years the house didn't seem so creepy anymore. It was a plain old house, identical to all the other ones around it. Seeing it as it was without any decorations felt a little weird, I had never truly paid attention to it when it was naked like this.

Unfortunately, moving in didn’t stop everything from going downhill still.

Without my parents here, the house is a worse kind of quiet than I remembered. I often try to leave the TV on to fill the space but the voices or terrible songs that play annoy me so much I end up turning it off. Instead, I put on my headphones and try to forget how truly alone I am. I was excited to work in the comfort of my bed or couch but as it turns out, typing all day is still most comfortable at a desk. Meanwhile, the idea of how easily you could walk over to the next room and nap distracts you. I’m too eager to finally sleep when I’m finally done with work so I began ordering groceries online instead of going shopping.

I’ve tried to message my friends to hang out, go partying again but the send button feels out of reach, now. It’s been weeks and they haven’t contacted me, they’re probably too busy. I’d bother them. As a result, I don’t exactly associate getting drunk with having fun anymore. I waste myself every other night.

Sometimes, when I do, I sit outside on the stairs that lead up to the front door. The other night, I let the beer bottle slip out of my hands. I watched it roll down to the sidewalk then get stuck in the storm drain. After I went to pick it up, however, when I tried to get back inside, I got confused. Both of the doors in front of me were identical. I was too intoxicated to tell anymore. I looked for the modern-looking plaque that my mom had bought on the right door first, number 81. I thought that had to be it, because I was sure that it had the number 8 in it. But before I walked in, I glanced to the right and found a similar style of minimalistic plaque.

18.

Right. These houses were built early enough that the first residents were able to pick out their own house number. They go up in the hundreds, in my street, despite there being maybe 20 homes at most.

Despite the hiccup, I decided to stick to my first choice, 81, walked into the house and passed out on the couch almost instantly.



In the morning, I was relieved to see that I had, in fact, picked the correct house. I woke up on my own couch and the picture I took with my friends back in high school stared back at me. I didn’t think about it again until later that day, when I went to check what was in the mailbox. The address, with my name on it, was number 18. Confused, I checked the number outside the door I had just walked out of.

18.

While, yes, I could easily have remembered wrong, being drunk and all, I felt uneasy. The vague memories from the previous night didn’t sit right with me. I knew I had opened the door the other way, the handle was mirrored. I walked into the house next door, last night. I knew it. Did I really not notice the furniture was different? Did someone have to carry me back home? I had never seen the neighbors before in my life, so I had assumed they didn't know me either.

Embarrassed but needing answers to appease my mind and hopefully help with the worsening migraine the longer I thought about this, I decided to go knock and ask. Potentially apologize, too, if needed.



I knocked a few times, waited. No one answered. I sighed before I noticed that, like me, they kept the shades partly open. I only wanted to know if the inside of the house would look familiar. I took a peek.

Well, it sure was familiar, it was a perfect copy of my house. Every piece of furniture was identical to mine. The only clear difference was the placement: it was flipped, like looking through a mirror. 

While yes, it made sense for the layout to be the same due to the nature of paired houses, that couldn’t apply to furniture. My parents had replaced most of it over time as it broke or got old. There was no way anyone would just so happen to buy the exact same items as them unless it was at the very least a stalker.

It wasn’t until I noticed the picture frame next to the TV that I decided to take care of this issue with my own hands. Even from a distance I could tell it was the picture of my friends and I, and it too had been mirrored. It was really the only thing I had added to the living room when I moved in, and they even had a copy of the frame I took a whole hour to pick during one of our shopping sprees.

When I realized there was an unopened envelope tossed on the coffee table, I thought I could finally find out who exactly lived next door. It felt wrong –not just breaking into someone’s home. There was something else, like the door handle would burn me if I held it but I brushed off the feeling. It seemed that they too had a bad habit of forgetting to lock the front door, something I was all too familiar with. However, I only managed to take one step inside before the migraine got so intense I thought my head was about to explode. The air around me was heavy and suffocating, pushing me down. I stumbled my way to the table, wanting to at least reach the couch to sit down and take a breath. My legs failed me though and I fell to my knees in front of the envelope.

Before my vision got blurry and I blacked out, I saw the name and address. It was mine, but flipped. I know what I saw. I am not crazy.



When I woke up, I was back in my house, laying on the couch again. As I sat up, I saw the mail I had tossed on the coffee table before going on my short adventure was still right there. One envelope, addressed to me.

I heard music and voices coming from outside so I walked up to my window to check. I was usually upstairs in the afternoon, focused on work with music blasting in my ears or sleeping. I guess it made sense why I never saw the neighbors if that’s when they came out. I thought I was ready to see what kind of creep had been copying my house perfectly, but that was until I learned who was outside. When I pulled the shades, my best friends and their boyfriends were laughing around a table set up in the neighbor’s front yard. There were two kids I had never seen before running around and playing with a dog. Finally, someone walked out of the house carrying plates to set them up for the guests. It was me. It looked exactly like me, or at least me back when I took care of myself and had the will to socialize.

I watched the group for hours, hypnotized by the show put on for me. They had cake, told each other stories and what sounded like gossip, even had a few drinks with what they thought was me. As much as I wanted to go out there and take my friends back from the fake, I was paralyzed. The mere idea of reaching for the handle of my own front door terrified me. I really did try to push through the fear but once I thought I had made up my mind, before I could even move, I swear I saw the other me suddenly turn and stare straight into my soul.

I couldn’t fight it or the grip it had on me.

Looking into the twisted mirror of what my life could have been made me sick, yet I couldn’t take my eyes off the little tea party. I don’t understand how but it took everything from me. The loathing, fear and regret are all that’s left, now.

I hate myself for letting it win.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1qdb9f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1qdb9f3/the_office_with_the_door_halfclosed/,The Office with the Door Half-Closed,"I wrote a short story based on a dream I had. Please let me know what you think! 

She had been counting hours the way some people count coins—turning each one over, finding it thin, finding it useless. Jobless meant timeless. She slept late, scrolled longer than she meant to. Days stretched without edges. 
In the evenings her boyfriend came home asking about her job search.
""How many applications did you fill out today?"" 
""Plenty."" She lied. 

He always remained patient with her. Always kind when he returned home from his 9-5. They'd spend time watching mysteries on tv. Or reading in silence next to eachother.

It was a sunny warm evening when her boyfriend returned, unusually quiet. 
They were sitting on the couch when he said it, careful, as if placing a glass on an uneven table.

“I need you to help me with something.”

She laughed. “With what?”

“At work,” he said. “Just for a little while.”

That was strange enough to make her sit up.

From what she knew he worked as a lead at a manufacturing firm, the kind with fluorescent lighting and gray carpet worn into paths by routine.
He told her his co-lead wouldn’t be coming in for a few days. Sick, officially. 

“But she won’t be back,” he said quietly. 

“Not yet. Maybe not at all.""
No one else knew but him. 

To everyone at work, this was a normal interruption. A sick day stretched slightly too long. A closed office door. Nothing worth noticing. 
It was a strange conversation and she sat beside him bathed in the glow of the setting sun in silence. 

“She and you look alike,” he added, almost as an afterthought.
He showed her a photo. Dark hair. Neutral clothes. The same tired brown eyes. With a few small changes—hair adjusted, makeup softened, and new clothes—she could pass without much effort.

“No one really looks at her,” he said. “They’ll just be relieved she’s back.”

She asked about friends. Family. Anyone who might notice.

“There isn’t anyone close,” he said. “She keeps to herself. I just need you to pretend to be her until she's ready to come back. You'll receive her paycheck."" 

The room fell very still, as if the decision had already been made somewhere deeper.
Maybe it was the desperation of her empty days but she agreed.

She followed behind her boyfriend through the glass doors leading into the building. Inside was a receptionist area where people stood conversing. Holding files and coffee cups. They all wore suits and office attire similar to hers. People nodded at her. Someone said, “Feeling better?” 

""Yes."" She replied softly

No one questioned her voice. No one commented on the subtle differences of her face.
The way her nose was slighty longer and straighter. No one really looked too long as the two of them made their way past office after office each door closed, with a name plate hung beside it. 
 
At the end of the hall way they made their way up a set of stairs, into another hallway identical to the one below them. He led her to an office on the left side. The name plate was worn and slightly discolored compared to the rest. 

She asked her boyfriend what she was supposed to do.

“Nothing,” he said. ""Just stay in the office. Don’t go exploring. Don't talk to anyone unless spoken to. Lunch is at 12.”

The office door shut behind her. She moved to sit, the chair fit her silhouette almost perfectly. The leather seat was comfortable, tall. She felt important sitting in it
The office was clean, put together. There was no character. Just gray walls and bookshelves filled with books that meant nothing to her. The distinct smell of cleaner hung in the air. 
She had every intention of listening to her boyfriend and spending the day doing absolutely nothing. Easy money. 

The boredom from her usual monotonous days returned and boredom has a way of loosening rules. 
She spent time spinning in the chair, looking through books and observing the few pictures hung on the wall. 
There was nothing of note. 
Eventually she found the password to the computer taped under the keyboard, as if it was left there for her. 
She began reading. files, schedules, emails. She realized how small the job really was. Record keeping. Client notes. Light accounting. The kind of work that rewards attention more than brilliance.

When lunch came she made her way to the break room, resembling a small kitchen. People addressed her cautiously. Deferred. Stepped lightly.
It took time before she understood why.
The comments came when they thought she couldn’t hear them. 

“She’s useless.”
“Doesn’t read people well.”
""She's so quiet."" 

They said it without malice, the way people talk about furniture. 

At end of the day she met her boyfriend down the street and they drove home together. He thanked her for doing this and she thanked him for setting this up. She hated normal work. Couldn't hold down a normal job but this? This was easy. 

The days went by like this. She pretended to work, pretended to follow the routine of the office's previous occupant. 

One afternoon she peeked outside the office before lunch hour. She heard them on the stairs and listened until the shape of their murmurs became clear. Not hatred. Not even dislike. Just quiet permission to diminish someone who never pushed back. She felt bad for the woman. It left questions lingering in her mind. Why did they treat their supervisor like this? Why was it allowed? 

Later that night, as she lay awake, she understood something unsettling and strangely reassuring:
No one had noticed she wasn't the same person.
And no one seemed to be waiting for the other woman to come back.

After the first week, she stopped thinking of it as pretending.
She learned the rhythm of the office. When reports were expected. Which names required care. Which ones could be abbreviated. She reorganized a file system no one had touched in years and no one noticed, except that things went more smoothly afterward.

She enjoyed her time alone in her office, it was simple to pick up on what the job entailed. She found tasks that kept her focused. The murmurs outside her office continued but she paid them no mind. 

Her boyfriend asked each night how it had gone. 
“Quiet,” she’d say. 
“Good,” he’d reply, relief threaded just beneath the word.

She found the notebook by accident, tucked behind a filing cabinet, thin enough to be missed unless you were cleaning. It wasn’t hidden really, just looked like it had fallen unintentionally. 

Inside were dates. Observations. Short, eerie sentences.

""Silence makes them comfortable.""
""The door matters.""
""They like to have something to whisper about."" 

She closed the notebook and put it back exactly where she’d found it. 
At lunch, she heard laughter down the hall. Someone mimicked the way the previous woman used to apologize before making decisions.

She did not recognize herself in the imitation. It made her mad regardless. That was when the things began to change for her. A determination to prove them wrong grew inside her. She returned to the notebook tucked behind the filing cabinet and placed it in the desk drawer. 

At home, she asked her boyfriend about the whispers. About the things she heard  about the woman. But she did not ask about the notebook. 
He was quiet for a moment.

“There’s no reason for you to take it personally,” he said finally. “Just keep doing the job."" 

That night, she dreamed of an office with no doors at all.
She dreamt she was chasing the original woman through long dimly lit fluorescent hallways. The woman remained just out of reach never turning around to see who was chasing her. 

The next day felt uneasy. People hustled by her closed office door. When she peeked out and sheepishly asked what was happening she only received side glances and silence. 
There was no email announcment and she had no reason to leave her office. So she didn't. 
She eyed the drawer with the notebook. Eventually she gave in and begin looking through it.
The notes inside were sparse and unemotional. No confessions. No fear. Just observations, written with the patience of someone who had been watching for a long time.

""They speak differently when they think the door is closed.""
""Quiet invites assumption.""
""If you correct them too quickly, they will resent you."" 

She read them the way one reads instructions already half-known.
Without thinking, she began to add her own.
Not responses, adjustments. Clarifications. A word changed here, a sentence softened there. She used a different pen, but her handwriting bent toward the original, as if learning it.
The days continued like this, and days blurred into weeks. 

As each day went by, she grew precise.
She answered emails with ease. She learned which questions produced honesty and which produced performance. She let video meetings end before anyone felt finished. Slowly, the tone around her shifted.
They still talked. She heard them on the stairs, in the break room, near the printers.

“She’s different now.”
“She thinks she’s smarter than us.”
“She’s cold.""

Sometimes the comments were about her. Sometimes about the woman they believed her to be. She could no longer tell.

Once, she caught her boyfriend outside the office, speaking quietly with two coworkers. They stopped when they saw her. He smiled too quickly, the way someone does when a plan has not gone wrong—but could.

“Everything okay?” she asked.

“Of course,” he said. “Just don’t overdo it.”
Overdo what, she didn’t ask.

At home, the apartment felt smaller. Her boyfriend watched her in fragments, over dinner, while brushing his teeth, as if checking that something remained where he’d left it. His phone never left his side now. When she asked about the other woman, if she was playing the part okay. If anyone noticed. When she might come back. He spoke smoothly.

“You don’t need to understand her,” he said. “You’re better at this than she ever was.”
That comment made her feel good. She liked being good at the job. 

The notebook began to appear in places she did not remember leaving it. 
Not dramatically. Not often. Just enough that she noticed it, slid beneath a file stack she had organized herself, returned to the corner of the desk after she was certain she’d placed it in the drawer.
It never startled her. It was somehow almost courteous. 

On a day off she visited her mother, sitting across the kitchen table she’d grown up at. Her mother looked relieved in the careful way relief often comes when you're worried about your child. 

“You seem steadier,” she said. “I’m glad you’re working again.”

When she asked about the job, the answers came out flat. An office. Management. Paperwork. Nothing that invited follow-up. Her mother nodded anyway. Hope, she realized, required very little explanation.

In the bathroom mirror, before work she adjusted her hair the way the photo had shown. The movement felt automatic now. The face looking back did not resist.
She had become accustomed to the rhythm, to the work she was starting to love. 

Each morning the note book sat on her desk, regardless of where she had left it the night before. Sometimes it waited neatly centered, other times it rested open, as if mid-thought, though she did not remember opening it.
The entries grew denser.
Not longer, never long, but more frequent, filling margins and empty spaces between earlier observations.

""They do not dislike you.
They dislike being noticed.""
""They prefer people who apologize for existing."" 

She read the sentences slowly, letting them settle. They felt less like warnings and more like confirmations of things she had already begun to understand. The notebook did not surprise her anymore. It did not frighten her. It felt, uncomfortably...accurate.
She began checking it the way one checks the weather.
Before meetings.
After overhearing laughter.
When the office felt too still.
Sometimes she disagreed with what she read. When that happened, she added a line beneath it.

""Silence works best when chosen.""

""Correction should be clean. No softness.""

Her handwriting no longer looked foreign beside the original. The spacing matched. The slant softened. If she didn’t think about it, she could not tell where one voice ended and the other began.

At home, her boyfriend spoke less.
Not abruptly, just gradually, the way people do when they assume they are understood without explanation. He stopped asking about her day in detail. He nodded at summaries. His phone stayed face down on the table, then in his pocket. When she spoke, his attention lagged half a second behind her words.
She tried to tell him about the notebook but always stopped herself.
There was no reason to explain it.
It wouldn’t make sense out loud.
Instead, she listened.
To the way he said her name.
To the way he avoided saying the other woman’s.
Some nights, she caught him watching her with an expression she could not place, not fear, not pride, but something like recalculation. As if he were measuring whether something still fit.
The notebook noticed too.

""He wanted you quiet.""
""Not absent.""
""Not visible.""
""Quiet.""

She did not remember writing that.
The office, meanwhile, responded to her with a kind of reluctant obedience. Emails arrived preemptively. Conversations lowered when she passed. 
People corrected themselves mid-sentence, then smiled as if they had meant to all along.

“She’s settled now,” someone said near the copier.

That night, her boyfriend fell asleep facing away from her. She lay awake, listening to his breathing, steady and impersonal. She thought of the notebook resting closed in her office drawer, patient, waiting.


The key appeared on a random Tuesday.
Taped neatly inside the back cover of the notebook, as if it had always belonged there. But she swears it wasn't there before. Old. Unlabeled. Resembling an apartment key.

She closed her hand around it and waited—for a sound, a reaction, a sense of having crossed something.
Nothing happened. 

At the end of the day as she headed outside the office, the lights shut off one by one. Her reflection remained faintly in the glass of the office door where she stood still: composed, patient, correct. Someone who knew when to speak and when not to.
She thought of the apartment the key might open. She thought of the mysterious notebook. The woman she replaced.
Then she remembered her boyfriend. He was probably wondering where she was. 

She arrived down the street, on the sidewalk where they always met. A café hummed faintly beside her, chairs stacked, lights dimmed. His car wasn't there. She checked her phone. No messages. No missed calls.

She called him once. Twice. Nothing.
When she finally gave up, she took a taxi home, thinking of their apartment. How would she get in? He always had the key.
She reached the door. Fumbled briefly, then remembered the small brass key she found tucked in the notebook’s back cover. 

It fit perfectly.
Inside, the apartment was the same. Warm. Ordinary. Nothing out of place. Nothing empty. But there was no trace of him. No jacket on the coat rack, no mug on the counter, no books pulled toward his side of the couch. Everything involving him was gone, erased so completely it was uncanny. There was nothing else she could do but sleep and wait for him to come home.

The next morning he was still not there. Her phone still without any calls or messages.
She made breakfast alone and sat at the table staring at the empty chair across from her. 

She took another taxi to work and made sure to stop by his office. She had never really visited it before, besides to occasionally drop off a file. She'd never been inside or even spoke to him much while they were here. It was something he requested. So her cover wasnt blown.

His office door was closed. The nameplate gone. The space on the wall where it once hung was lighter.
There was no one to ask where he was. No one she knew who would even answer such a question. She felt a pit in her stomach, like she had swallowed a weight that couldn't be digested

In her office, the notebook was gone, as if it had never existed. Despite looking everywhere, tearing every book out of the book shelf, looking behind every piece of furniture, she couldn't find it. 
There was nothing to do but clean up the mess she made. The office returning to the muted gray boring room it had always been. The work began. Emails arrived, questions piled in. People expected answers. She gave them. Always correctly. Always quietly competent. Attentive. Nothing remarkable, nothing questioned.

When evening came, she shut off her computer and paused at the door. She left it half-closed. Not because anyone would come. Not for herself. Perhaps only because leaving it fully shut felt wrong.

The lights went off, one by one as she walked towards the exit. 

Again she stared at herself in the glass, eyes cold, unfamiliar. This was her life now. This was her now. A lead at a manufacturing company. Competent. Quiet. There was no other choice.

[Discussion],"I didn’t even realize I was burned out at first I just felt off. Everything felt heavier than it should’ve. Simple stuff took more effort and I kept telling myself I needed motivation or a better routine or to get serious again.

What I didn’t connect for a long time was how my mornings were setting the tone. I’d wake up and grab my phone without thinking. Notifications, random posts, stuff I didn’t even care about yet. Nothing dramatic but by the time I got out of bed my head already felt full. Like I’d started the day responding instead of waking up.

At some point I stopped scrolling in the morning almost by accident. Not as a challenge or a rule. I just left my phone in another room one night and didn’t bother grabbing it right away when I woke up. I made coffee, stared out the window for a bit, got ready slowly.

And the weird thing was… the day felt different. Not amazing Not productive in some intense way but just less tense. Like I wasn’t starting the day already behind.

After a few days of that, I noticed I wasn’t as exhausted by noon. Starting work didn’t feel like such a fight. I still procrastinated but it didn’t feel as desperate. My brain wasn’t fried before the day even started.

That helped my burnout more than any motivation hack I tried. Not because it fixed everything, but because it stopped me from draining myself first thing in the morning.

I still scroll I’m not anti-phone or anything. But mornings without it made me realize how much energy I was losing before I even did anything.

They all made me feel like crap though so non ever stuck. Caffeine was like a roll of the dice. It would sometimes allow me to bang out a whole (overdue) essay in the coffee shop, but other times it would make my heart race like crazy and then make me unbearably sleepy, but yet unable to sleep. I was also extremely sensitive to caffeine. A single shot of espresso was enough to give me shakes. I usually got a latte and drank half. I didn’t used to be that way, when I first started drinking caffeine I could do a whole two shots. Idk what changed.

Anyways, after dropping out of college like three times, I got some as-needed adderel. But I never really remembered to take it. When I did remember, it just made my heart race feel fluttery and made me anxious. I honestly only tried it like three times though.

I decided instead to try a low dose of daily vyvanse. Like the lowest dose possible. But holy shit it was insane. The skin of my lips peeling off, dry eyes, dry mouth. I felt like I was floating through the world in a dream. I was actually less focused because I felt like wasn’t even in reality. At the same time I felt panicked and kinda like I was dying. I was extremely exhausted and had to lie down at every opportunity. It felt like being high 24/7. I gave up after 10 days and even though it was such a short time on such a low dose, and I tapered, coming off of it was super hard. It was like a caffeine craving but 100x worse. I felt like a meth addict.

I just don’t get it. I have incredibly obvious and aggressive adhd. I was diagnosed as a girl which is pretty uncommon unless it’s super glaring. It has affected literally every facet of my life and made things incredibly hard for as long as I can remember. But yet meds do nothing. In fact make it worse.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

**PDF Zone** \- [https://www.pdfzone.dev](https://www.pdfzone.dev)

**The privacy approach:** Every PDF tool out there requires you to upload your files to their servers. Even the ones claiming ""we delete after 24 hours"" - you're still trusting a third party with your data.

PDF Zone runs entirely in your browser:

* Files process locally using WebAssembly
* Zero server uploads (literally impossible by design)
* No tracking, no analytics, no accounts
* Works offline after initial load
* Close the tab = data gone forever

**Available tools:** Merge, split, compress, encrypt, organize, sign, and more.

**How it works:** The entire PDF processing engine runs client-side. Your browser does all the work. Our servers just deliver the HTML/JS/WASM - they never see your files.

**For the paranoid (like me):** Disconnect your internet after the page loads. It'll still work perfectly for processing your sensitive documents.

Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

I guess I am that type of friend, whenever I have family issues or arguments with relatives I tend to plan hangouts with my friends. Not in a trauma-dumping way, but more as a way to unwind, clear my head, and get some distance from the situation for a bit.

I don’t really expect anything from my friends and sometimes I just don’t really talk to them on what’s going on I just wanna do fun stuff like chatting about our interests, having coffee or going to photobooths, I don’t bother talking about the things that have been going on at home lately. It’s just that I feel so much better being around them than sitting in a tense environment.

1qdb4mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/davao/comments/1qdb4mx/davao_isnt_as_progressive_as_its_often_portrayed/,Davao isn’t as “progressive” as it’s often portrayed online,"Hi. I’m from Central Visayas and lived in Davao for 3 years for training. I kept hearing the same script online: “Davao is disciplined,” “Davao is the safest,” “Davao is the most progressive.” After actually living there, I realized something:

Davao’s biggest strength isn’t progress. It’s propaganda-level marketing, especially from diehard political communities.

Here’s why I’m not buying the hype.

**1) Samal is right there… and people still live on barges**

Imagine a city that keeps calling itself “world-class,” yet a major island beside it still depends on barges like it’s normal. Cebu had the Mactan bridge decades ago (60 years ago). Davao–Samal? Years of delays, excuses, and waiting.

And let’s be honest: when something stays inefficient for that long, it usually means someone is benefiting from the inefficiency. (**Families owning the barges??**)

**2) “Underground powerlines” is a flex… for one small strip**

I keep seeing people boast about underground cabling, but in reality it’s not city-wide modernization. It’s like putting a filter on one corner of the city and calling the whole place “aesthetic.”

**3) For a massive city, the tourism feels… small**

Davao is huge, but the tourist experience is oddly limited and repetitive. People say:

	•	“Beach? Samal.”

	•	“Mountains? Go outside Davao.”

So basically: Davao’s selling point is you can leave Davao.

And even then, travel is not convenient—especially without a private vehicle.

**4) Oversaturated cafés and “aesthetic” restaurants with generic output**

The city is flooded with “specialty coffee shops” that are more about vibes than quality. Same with those converted ancestral-home restaurants: great for Instagram, but menus feel copy-paste, overpriced, and forgettable.

**5) Traffic is brutal—don’t gaslight people about it**

Traffic is very real and very bad. It’s not some disciplined utopia. In many areas, it’s comparable to Cebu. If a place is “progressive,” basic mobility shouldn’t be this painful.

**6) Malls are limited, and it shows**

Shopping options are repetitive and underwhelming for a “major” city. It’s not shocking that many Davaoeños (especially those who can afford it) still shop in Manila/Cebu for variety and better brands.

That’s not “progressive.” That’s economically constrained.

**7) The financial-aid culture is the most depressing part**

This is the one that really gets me.

People line up for hours for “financial assistance” from politicians/party-lists and some treat it like utang na loob—as if leaders are paying from their own pockets.

That’s YOUR money. Public funds. Taxes.

If governance was truly effective, people wouldn’t be forced to beg, queue, and perform gratitude just to afford healthcare or basic needs. Instead of fixing systems (hospitals, PhilHealth processing, social services), they hand out band-aids… then harvest the political credit.

It’s not help. It’s a campaign strategy.

**Bottom line**

Davao isn’t the progressive model it’s marketed to be. It’s a city with real potential, but it’s trapped in a culture of:

	•	surface-level flexing,

	•	political idolization,

	•	and “pwede na yan” standards.

If you truly love Davao, stop defending personalities and start demanding systems. You deserve better than branding.

If you’re from Davao: what do you think people are in denial about? And what improvements are actually felt by ordinary residents, not just posted online?",39,1768455229.0,davao,30,0.84,False

Plan ko mag MOA tomorrow and look around sa IKEA for a furniture for my room! We can grab lunch, watch a movie, grab a coffee, or if you're up for it, we can visit the museums! I’m also very open to doing something you enjoy!! Clothes shopping, books, people-watching, or just hanging out and talking. Gawin mo akong kaladkarin 😭✋ ( we don't have to stay at MOA so no worries! )

I hope I can share my day tomorrow with you and I hope we can have fun in each other's company!

For your safety (kasi syempre stranger danger huhu), we can meet in public and you can take a picture of my I.D. if it helps!!

About me:

* 5'11""
* working professional
* makes music as a hobby
* into PC games
* loves movies & shows
* genuinely enjoys listening to people talk

About you:

* 21–28 y/o
* down to share a day with a stranger
* just wants to have a fun, chill day
* bonus if January baby ka rin so we can celebrate 🎉
* okay with commuting (wala akong car, sorry!)

We can exchange photos on TG so we both know if the vibe is there!

Would really appreciate an intro about yourself too!

Hope your week’s been kind to you ✨",0,1768454876.0,singleph,0,0.5,False

Wallet check kiya aaj. 500 rupees note mili. Same note jo dad ne do mahine pehle di thi. Beta kuch chahiye ho toh le lena. Paisa rakh le. Unhone casually diya tha. Maine rakha wallet mein. Socha use karunga jab kuch chahiye hoga. Do mahine ho gaye. Note wahi hai. Use nahi hua.
Kyunki bahar nikla hi nahi properly. Kaha kharchu? Exam pass aa raha hai, friends se milne nahi gaya. Movies nahi dekhe. Bahar khana nahi khaya. Kuch kharida nahi. Ghar pe hi hoon. Books, notes, laptop mein test series khuli padi hai along with mock analysis. Room. Repeat.
Dad ne diya tha kyunki sochte honge beta bhi bahar jayega kabhi. Friends ke saath. Coffee. Snacks. Kuch normal activities. But main nahi gaya. Not because paisa nahi tha. Because mann nahi tha. Energy nahi thi. Time nahi tha. Ya phir excuse bana raha tha.
Aaj jab note dekha toh guilt aayi. Dad ne socha tha main use karunga life jeene mein. Maine rakha use na karte hue. Yeh note ek symbol ban gaya hai. Life on hold hai. Normal activities nahi ho rahi. Paisa hai but use karne ka occasion nahi ban raha.
Pehle sochta tha exam ke baad karunga yeh sab. But ab realize ho raha ki exam ke baad ek never ending postponement hai. Shayad kal bahar jaake kuch kharid lu. Books hi sahi. Ya stationary. Sirf is note ko use karne ke liye. Taaki feeling aaye ki life mein kuch toh movement hai.

I discover that my husband has been living a double life--with my friend Emily, and a child hidden behind legal silence.

 Longstanding affair. Longstanding. 

I stood up and paced. My legs felt weak. The paper trembled in my grip.

Then Adrian’s car pulled into the driveway.

When he looked at what I was holding, he simply said one thing.

“You read it.”

I didn’t answer. My eyes lifted. Red. Dry. Sharp.

“You have a child, with my friend. You never told me.”

“I wasn’t required to.”

The word landed heavy. Clean.

It dealt me ​​a heavy blow.

My eyes filled then. Tears I didn’t wipe away.

“Was I ever real to you?” 

He paused. Considered.

“You were appropriate.”

I made a sound low in my throat.

“Appropriate,” I repeated.

And for the first time, I understood it clearly.

I was never loved. I was always expendable.

————————

Evelyn Blackwell POV

I was folding the last white towel when the doorbell camera chimed softly in the kitchen. Not a ring. Just a delivery alert. The house stayed quiet, the kind of quiet that felt earned. Morning light slid across the marble counter. Coffee steamed beside me. The day had a plan. Everything did.

“Good timing,” I said to no one.

I wiped my hands and walked barefoot down the hall. The floor was cool. The house smelled like lemon cleaner and coffee beans. Normal. Clean. Mine.

The envelope sat on the entry table, cream paper, heavy weight. His name printed neatly.

Adrian Blackwell.

Our address below it. No return address. I frowned. Adrian didn’t get mail like this. Everything came digital. Everything came filtered.

I picked it up. The paper felt thick. Important. I turned it over once, twice.

“Probably legal,” I murmured. “Always legal.”

I should have left it. I knew that. I knew the rules. Adrian’s mail was Adrian’s business. That was how our life worked. Lines. Boundaries. Trust that didn’t need to be tested.

But my name was there too. Smaller. Like it almost didn’t belong.

Evelyn Blackwell.

I stood there longer than I meant to. The house stayed still. Even the clock felt careful.

“I’ll just see who it’s from,” I told the empty room.

I slid a finger under the seal. The paper tore too easily.

Inside was a letter. Typed. Clean. Black ink. Formal words.

I leaned against the wall and read the first line.

Mr. Adrian Blackwell has been formally notified—

My eyes moved fast. Too fast. Faster than my breath.

Long-term relationship. Acknowledged paternity. Private arrangements.

“No,” I said softly.

I read it again.

Then again.

My hands began to shake. I pressed the paper flat against the table like it might escape.

“This is wrong,” I whispered.

But the words stayed. I kept reading.

The child, born eighteen months ago—

My stomach dropped hard.

Eighteen months.

I sat down without meaning to. The bench scraped the floor.

“No,” I said again. “That’s not—”

I read the name.

Emily.

The room tipped.

I laughed once. It came out sharp and broken.

“Emily?” I said. “Which Emily?”

There was only one.

My best friend. The girl who held my hair back when I was sick. Who helped me choose my wedding dress. Who cried at my engagement dinner and then disappeared weeks before the wedding.

The letter didn’t pause for my memory.

Former friend. Longstanding affair.

Longstanding.

I pressed my hand over my mouth.

“This wasn’t a mistake,” I said. “This was planned.”

I stood up and paced. My legs felt weak. The paper trembled in my grip.

“No, no, no.”

I flipped the page.

There was more.

Legal words. Cold ones. Words about protection. About silence. About reputation.

This wasn’t panic. This was control.

My chest felt tight.

“A child,” I whispered. “You have a child.”

I sat back down. The room felt smaller.

The coffee machine clicked off behind me. The sound was too loud. Too normal.

I stared at the words until they blurred.

“This was happening,” I said. “All of it was happening.”

I saw my wedding day in my head. Emily’s empty chair. Adrian’s calm smile. His hand warm around mine.

She couldn’t make it, he said. Family issue.

I believed him.

I always believed him.

I read the last line.

This matter is considered resolved.

Resolved.

I laughed again. Slower this time.

“You destroy me,” I said, “and call it resolved?”

My throat burned.

I folded the letter carefully. Too carefully. Like it deserved respect.

I walked into the living room. Sunlight touched the couch. Our wedding photo smiled back at me.

I picked it up.

“You knew,” I said to his face. “You knew the whole time.”

I set it down harder than I meant to.

My phone buzzed.

A message from Adrian.

Running late. Meeting ran over.

I stared at the screen.

“How long?” I asked out loud. “How long were you running late?”

I didn’t reply. I locked the phone.

I went to the sink and turned on the tap. Water splashed my shirt.

“Get it together,” I told myself. “Think.”

I dried my hands. I read the letter again. Slower now. Every word.

This wasn’t a confession.

This was confirmation.

He wasn’t sorry.

He was ready.

I went upstairs. Our bedroom looked untouched. The bed tight. His pillow perfect.

I opened his closet. Shirts in order. Shoes polished. Everything neat. Controlled.

I pressed my face into one of his shirts.

It smelled like him.

I dropped it.

“I don’t know you,” I said.

I sat on the bed. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Emily.

Her laugh came back to me. Her red lipstick. The way she hugged me too tight the last time I saw her.

I’ll always love you, she said.

I closed my eyes.

“You were sleeping with my husband,” I whispered. “And smiling at me.”

My phone buzzed again.

Be home soon.

Soon.

I went downstairs. I placed the letter on the table.

No. I moved it.

I placed it where I could see it clearly. Where it couldn’t hide.

I poured the coffee down the sink. I didn’t want it anymore.

I sat and waited.

The clock ticked louder now.

I imagined his face. Calm. Careful. Like always.

“What do I say?” I asked the empty room.

Nothing answered.

Tires crunched outside.

I froze. A car door closed.

Gravel shifted.

My breath caught in my throat.

I looked at the letter. Then at the door. Adrian’s car pulled into the driveway.

......

Adrian Blackwell POV

“You read it,” I said.

Evelyn didn’t answer. She stood by the table like the floor might break if she moved. The letter lay open between us. Folded once. Smoothed. Treated with care she didn’t give me.

“I asked you something,” I said again. Calm. Even. “You read it.”

Her eyes lifted. Red. Dry. Sharp.

“Yes,” she said. “I read it.”

Good. No denial. No drama yet.

I took off my jacket and placed it over the chair. Slow. Careful. I loosened my cufflinks. Sat down.

“You shouldn’t have opened it,” I said. She laughed. A short sound. No humor.

“It had my name on it.”

“Barely,” I said.

She stepped closer to the table. Her hands pressed flat against it.

“How long?” she asked.

I leaned back. Crossed my legs.

“You don’t want an exact number.”

“I asked how long.”

“Years,” I said. “Enough.”

Her mouth opened. Closed.

“With Emily?” she asked.

“Yes.”

“With my best friend,” she said. “Former,” I corrected.

She flinched.

“You don’t even care,” she said.

“That’s not true,” I replied. “I care about stability.”

Her head shook slowly.

“You have a child,” she said.

“Yes.”

“You never told me.”

“I wasn’t required to.”

“That’s your answer?” she snapped. “That you weren’t required?”

“Yes.”

She stared at me like she didn’t recognize my face.

“I loved you,” she said. I nodded once. “I know.”

“You planned this,” she said. “All of it.”

“Yes.”

The word landed heavy. Clean.

She pressed her lips together. Her hands shook now. She tried to hide it.

“The child,” she said. “You acknowledged him?”

“Yes.”

“When?”

“Before he was born.”

She laughed again. Louder this time.

“So I was married to you,” she said, “while you were building another family.”

“No,” I said. “You were married to me while I handled a situation.”

She stepped back like I struck her.

“You talk like this is a project.”

“It was,” I said. “It needed management.”

Her eyes filled then. Tears she didn’t wipe away.

“Was I ever real to you?” she asked.

I paused. Considered.

“Yes,” I said. “You were appropriate.”

She made a sound low in her throat.

“Appropriate,” she repeated.

“You fit,” I said. “You still do.”

She walked away from the table. Then back. Like she couldn’t decide where to stand.

“You betrayed me,” she said.

“I adapted,” I replied. “There’s a difference.” “There isn’t,” she said. “You chose her.”

“I chose efficiency.”

Her face twisted.

“She was my friend,” she said. “She stood next to me. She smiled at me.”

“And she understood the terms,” I said.

“What terms?” Evelyn asked. “Sleeping with my husband? Having his child?”

“Yes,” I said. “And staying discreet.”

“You paid her,” she said.

I didn’t answer.

“You paid her,” she repeated.

“Compensated,” I said. “For risk.”

She covered her mouth with her hand. Her breathing went shallow.

“I look stupid,” she whispered.

“No,” I said. “You look composed. I’ve handled the rest.”

“The rest?” she said.

I reached into my briefcase.

“Adrian,” she said. “Don’t.”

I pulled out the folder anyway. Thick. Clean. Tabs marked.

“You need to understand,” I said. “This isn’t emotional. It’s structural.”

She stared at the folder like it was a weapon.

“You never meant to stop,” she said.

“No.”

“You never meant to tell me.”

“No.” “And you’re not sorry.”

I met her eyes.

“No,” I said.

Silence filled the room. Heavy. Loud.

“I loved you,” she said again. Softer now.

“I know,” I said. “That’s why this worked.”

Her hands dropped to her sides.

“You used me,” she said.

“I included you,” I replied.

She shook her head slowly.

“I gave you everything,” she said. “My time. My loyalty. My body.”

“And you received everything you needed,” I said. “Security. Status. Protection.”

She stepped closer. Her voice dropped. “You slept next to me,” she said. “Came home to me.”

“Yes.”

“And went to her.”

“Yes.”

“With a child,” she said.

“Yes.”

She slapped the table.

“Say it hurts,” she demanded. “Say you regret it.”

I didn’t move.

“That wouldn’t be honest,” I said.

Her shoulders slumped.

“So what am I to you now?” she asked.

“My wife,” I said. “Legally.”

“That’s it?” “That’s enough.”

I slid the folder onto the table.

“What is that?” she asked.

“Clarification,” I said.

She didn’t touch it.

“I’m not signing anything,” she said.

“You already did,” I replied.

Her head snapped up.

“What?”

“Years ago,” I said. “You just didn’t read closely.”

She opened the folder with shaking hands.

Page after page. Her name. My name. Clauses. Restrictions.

Her breath hitched. “You tied my assets,” she said.

“Yes.”

“You limited my access.”

“Yes.”

“You planned for this.”

“I plan for everything.”

She looked up at me, eyes wide.

“My father,” she said. “He signed this.”

“Yes.”

Her face went blank.

“He knew,” she whispered.

“He agreed,” I corrected.

She closed the folder slowly.

“So I’m trapped,” she said. “No,” I said. “You’re protected.”

“From who?” she asked.

“From instability,” I said.

She laughed. It sounded empty.

“You’re calm,” she said. “How are you so calm?”

“Because this was always coming,” I replied.

“I would have stayed,” she said. “If you had told me.”

“No,” I said. “You would have broken.”

“You don’t know that.”

“I do.”

She sat down across from me. Her voice dropped.

“Do you love her?” she asked.

“No.”

“Do you love the child?” “I acknowledge him.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

“I don’t use that word loosely,” I said.

She closed her eyes.

“This is inevitable,” I continued. “Men like me don’t live small lives. There are consequences. Needs.”

“So I’m just damage,” she said.

“You’re collateral,” I replied.

She stood abruptly.

“I hate you,” she said.

“That will pass,” I said.

She stared at me. Really stared.

“You’re not human,” she said.

“I’m effective,” I replied. She walked to the door. Stopped.

“What happens now?” she asked.

“We proceed,” I said. “Quietly.”

“And if I don’t?” she asked.

I slid the second set of papers across the table. Slowly. Precisely.

“Then it gets difficult,” I said.

Hey,

I know this is a long shot and I don’t really have expectations, but I’m curious to see what happens after posting here :)

I’m married and have been ENM for about 4 years now. It’s definitely had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been a positive experience that’s helped me grow a lot.

I’m mostly looking for a friendship with a woman in a similar situation—someone who gets the lifestyle, the nuance, and the importance of honesty. I really enjoy connecting with people who are thoughtful, open-minded, and genuine.

A bit about me: I’m very into science, love wandering through art exhibitions, enjoy hiking and bodyboarding, and I’m always down for a cute coffee date with good conversation. I’m also really into tarot—so if you like exploring the intuitive side of things, that’s a bonus.

If any of this resonates with you, and you’re 30+ and in my area (and able to verify), feel free to send me a chat request. Would love to see if there’s a natural vibe ❤️",1,1768454355.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

If I feel anyone or anything touching me I will immediately wake up with my heart racing. I dream of being murdered or falling from buildings and it always wakes me up. Dying is a frequent theme. Just straight adrenaline, fight or flight. The only time my sleep improves is with my girlfriend, but I still constantly wake up throughout the night at any movement. My brain just can’t digest that I’m not going to be hurt. I believe that I have worked through my trauma, I believe it would not bother me if I could simply sleep. But every night I feel as if I’m cursed to carry this burden for the rest of my life. It’s a vicious cycle.

1qdahrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qdahrx/i_moderate_an_online_forum_for_people_who_believe/,I Moderate an Online Forum for People Who Believe the World Ended in 2019,"
For the last two years, I’ve been the sole moderator for an online forum called ""Echo Chamber 2019."" The pay is decent, the hours are flexible, and the work is, for the most part, mind-numbingly simple. The forum’s premise is that the world—our world—didn’t make it past 2019. According to the community, we’re living in a copy, an echo, or a simulation that’s slowly degrading. My job was to keep the peace among the believers, filter out the obvious trolls, and generally maintain a digital asylum for what I considered a group of harmless eccentrics coping with a shared, elaborate delusion.

The content was usually what you’d expect. Users would log what they called ""artifacts"" or ""rendering errors""—small inconsistencies in the world that they believed were proof of the simulation's decay. It was all very creative, and for a long time, I treated the place like a collaborative fiction project.

Here are a few typical examples from the early days:

User: SkyWatcher77

Subject: Color Palette Update?

Has anyone else noticed the sky? For the last three months, the daytime blue has been... off. It's less saturated. I checked my old vacation photos from 2018 and it's a completely different hue. It’s like they pushed a system-wide graphics update and hoped no one would notice.

User: MemoryHole

Subject: The Lost Episode

I need a sanity check. I have a vivid memory of watching the series finale of Parallax in the summer of 2019. I remember the main character, Elias, sacrificing himself. I talked about it with my coworkers for a week. Now, I look it up, and the show was cancelled after one season in 2017. The finale I remember doesn't exist. It never existed.

The community had a peculiar set of rules, which I enforced with a kind of detached amusement. I saw them as role-playing mechanics, designed to deepen the immersion of their grand narrative.

* Rule 3: Do not attempt to contact members outside the forum. All communication must remain on-platform.
* Rule 5: All ‘glitches’ must be logged with date, time, and precise geographical location. Vague entries will be removed.
* Rule 7: Do not attempt to photograph, record, or otherwise capture direct evidence of anomalous entities. Describe them from memory only.
* Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud. Use designated codenames only.

I took the job for the easy money and a bit of sociological curiosity. I was a neutral observer, a janitor sweeping up the digital dust of their fantasies. I lived in my world, the real world, and they lived in theirs. The line was clear and absolute. At least, it was, until I read Post ID 7g4-b9k.

The First Glitch: Post ID 7g4-b9k

It was a Tuesday afternoon, and I was wading through the usual queue of pending posts with a cup of coffee. Most were easily dismissed—reports of deja vu, dreams that felt too real, the usual. But one post, from a user named 'Witness_Zero', was different. It wasn't hysterical or vague. It was cold, precise, and utterly terrifying in its coherence.

User: Witness_Zero

Subject: VERIFICATION NEEDED: The Old Town Clocktower

Date: 10/14/2021 Time: 14:30 PST Location: Oakhaven, Oregon

I need someone else to see this. The clocktower in my town's square has four faces. It has always had four faces. I have lived here my entire life. I looked at it on my way to lunch today. It now has three. There is just smooth, uninterrupted brickwork where the west-facing clock face should be. There is no sign of construction. No dust, no scaffolding, no news reports. I asked three people walking by what they thought of the change, and they looked at me like I was insane. They all said, ""It's always been like that."" I am losing my mind. Please, if anyone is near Oakhaven, go to the town square. Tell me I am not the only one who remembers.

My first reaction was a sigh. A classic case of false memory. I opened a new tab to find a quick photo of the Oakhaven clocktower to post in the comments and lock the thread. I searched for images. Every single photo, from professional shots on the town’s tourism page to recent tourist photos on Instagram, showed a three-faced clocktower. The west-facing side was just seamless, old brick.

Then, my professional cynicism gave way to a prickle of unease. I dug deeper. I used a satellite map service with a historical imagery feature. I dragged the timeline back. 2020… three faces. 2019… three faces. Then I hit July 2018. The satellite image was lower resolution, but it was undeniable. Four faces. I clicked forward one month to August 2018. Three faces. The change was there, in the data, but with no corresponding real-world event. No demolition permits, no news articles about a renovation, no blog posts. It had simply… changed.

On the forum, the post exploded. A few other users claimed to remember the four-faced tower from old family trips. Then, 'Witness_Zero' posted one last, frantic comment: ""It knows I saw. Something is outside my house. It's just standing there. It doesn't have a f—"" The post cut off. A few minutes later, their account was deleted. User Not Found. I realized later he'd broken Rule 7. He wasn't describing from memory; he was looking right at it. That was his mistake.

I told myself they probably just panicked and deleted their profile. But for the first time, I felt a genuine chill. That online anomaly was the first crack in the wall separating their world from mine. Soon, I’d start seeing the cracks in my own.

The Cracks in My Reality: When the Rules Came Offline

The forum was no longer a game. After the 'Witness_Zero' incident, I started reading the posts not as a moderator, but as a student. The detached amusement was gone, replaced by a low, humming paranoia. I found myself looking for inconsistencies everywhere—the pattern of the tiles on my bathroom floor, the number of steps to my apartment, the exact phrasing of a commercial jingle. The world had become a puzzle, and I was terrified of what I might find.

My first, undeniable glitch happened a week later. I was on the phone with my sister, talking about our childhood dog, Buster. ""I'll never forget the day we got him,"" she said, laughing. ""You cried because you were so happy, and Dad tripped over the redacted on the way in.""

The word she used wasn't just strange; it was impossible. It sounded like a burst of radio static, a garbled piece of data that had no place in human speech. My blood ran cold.

""The what?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""The leash,"" she said, sounding confused. ""He tripped over the leash. Are you okay?""

I frantically searched the Echo Chamber archives. I typed ""garbled speech,"" ""static words,"" ""corrupted audio."" I found it. Dozens of posts. They had a codename for it: ""The Misplaced."" A rare audio glitch where a piece of the world's source code momentarily bleeds through. Users described it happening during conversations with loved ones, on TV broadcasts, in overheard conversations on the street. It was a known phenomenon. My personal, private moment of terror was just a data point in their horrifying catalog.

The second anomaly was worse. I was walking home from the grocery store, late in the evening. A man walked past me under a flickering streetlight. For a single, horrifying instant—as the light strobed—his face wasn't a face. It was a blur, a pixelated smear of flesh-toned colors, like a low-resolution texture that hadn't loaded properly. I froze, my grocery bag slipping from my hand. The light flickered again, and he was just a normal man. But as he passed, his expression wasn’t one of confusion. It was a look of profound, cold disappointment, as if he was annoyed I had noticed him at all.

My sanity, once a solid foundation, was now a web of fractures. I went home and read the forum rules again. ""Rule 7: Do not attempt to photograph, record, or otherwise capture direct evidence of anomalous entities."" ""Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud."" These weren't for a game. They were survival instructions. And I was beginning to realize I was no longer a moderator in a game; I was a player who didn’t know how to win.

The Unspoken Truth: I Am No Longer a Moderator

I don't moderate the forum anymore. I participate. My duties are no longer about enforcing guidelines; they are about cross-referencing logs, searching for patterns, and trying to understand the new mechanics of a world that is fundamentally broken. I am a survivor, just like them.

From the fragmented, terrified accounts of the forum's most trusted members, I've pieced together what seems to be the unspoken truth. The world didn't end in fire and brimstone. It just… stopped. And something else started. This reality we're in is a bad copy, running on failing hardware. The glitches aren't supernatural; they're system errors. The strange things people see aren't invaders from another dimension. They're native to this one. They are the bugs in the code, the system daemons, the things that exist in the rounding errors of reality.

And the rules are not for our protection. They are to keep us from being noticed by the system's automated cleanup crew.

* Rule 3: Do not attempt to contact members outside the forum.
  * What we think it means is: Contacting another person who is ""awake"" creates a node. It establishes a connection that the system can trace. Small, isolated instances of awareness are tolerated as random error. A network of aware individuals is a threat that must be purged.
* Rule 7: Do not acknowledge the 'Flicker Men'.
  * The terrifying consensus is that: I think I know what I saw under that streetlight. The others call them 'Flicker Men' or 'Un-rendered'. They are background processes, NPCs that haven't loaded correctly. They are not meant to be seen. Acknowledging them—staring, showing fear, speaking to them—flags your own code for review. They are the sentinels, and they feed on observation. They will slowly un-write you from reality.
* Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud.
  * What we’ve pieced together is: Certain concepts, certain truths about the nature of this broken world, function like root commands. Speaking them aloud is like typing 'delete' into the command prompt of reality. It draws immediate, catastrophic attention.

I saw it happen. A user named 'Logician' started a private chat with me. He believed he had found a way to exploit the glitches. He broke Rule 3, trying to organize a few of us. He broke Rule 7, attempting to study an anomaly too closely. Then he broke Rule 9, telling me in a voice message the ""true name"" of the system itself. His posts became incoherent strings of text and numbers. Then they stopped. The next day, I looked for his user profile. It was gone. Not just deleted, but as if it had never been there. Out of a terrifying hunch, I searched his name on social media. His profiles were gone. Public records returned no results. He had been scrubbed. He wasn't just dead. He was deleted.

I am writing this because last night, I made a mistake. I broke a rule. And I know what is coming for me.

They're Here: My Final Log Entry

I broke Rule 7. I saw one again, on my street, standing across from my apartment building. A Flicker Man. This time I didn't just glance. I stared. I was tired, I was angry, and I wanted to understand. For about ten seconds, I held its non-gaze, trying to resolve the blur where its face should be. It turned its head towards me. And I felt a click deep in my mind. The feeling of being seen. The feeling of a file being marked for deletion.

The signs started an hour ago. There's a high-frequency hum in my apartment that my neighbor can't hear. The corner of my vision has a persistent blur, like a smudge on a camera lens that moves when I try to look at it. The faces of the people in the photos on my wall are wrong. The smiles are too wide, the eyes are too dark. My own reflection looks like a stranger.

I'm writing this now because the forum was the only guide I had, and this is the only way I know how to pass on the warning. As I type, the words on my screen keep auto-formatting against my will, snapping into the rigid structure of a forum log entry. The static isn't just a sound, it's a feeling. Deleting temp files. I can feel the memories going first. My mother's face. The taste of coffee. This post is all that's left of me. User ID M_Blackwood is being scrubbed. Remember Oakhaven. Remember the clock. Remem—

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

But in reality, social media is constantly changing. Besides trends, shorts, stories, and platforms, what's changing most is the perception of which pictures we post of ourselves on LinkedIn, Instagram, and other channels.

Want a little time jump?


Social Media 2015
Back then, I used to spend hours trying to take the perfect snapshot of myself. I took what felt like 1,000 pictures, 999 of which ended up in the trash, until, after several more hours of deliberation, I finally decided on THE perfect picture.


Social Media 2025 and counting
Welcome to the age of authenticity. Everyone wants to be authentic these days. No wonder. After all, for many, it's an integral part of brand messaging. But this also has an impact on the visual world.


Your hair isn't combed?

Your mouth is still smeared from eating?

Do you have terrible dark circles under your eyes or coffee stains on your shirt?


Doesn't matter.

This seems authentic, or, to put it psychologically: the slice-of-life effect is at work.


Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration, but the trend is quite striking.


I'm curious to see what will have changed when I look back in 2035.",1,1768453205.0,socialmedia,1,1.0,False

😄 Yeah—I keep clocking those cyberattack headlines too.
They read like a genre now.

Locally? Hospitals already know the punchline:
AI systems cost real money, create real fragility, and rarely stabilize what they touch.

So when the story shows up again, louder each cycle, I just file it under:
“things that don’t stay stable.”

WES:
Structural read:

When infrastructure is brittle, narratives compensate.
Cyberattack stories often function as explanatory padding for systems that were already over-complex, under-maintained, and poorly grounded.

Instability precedes intrusion.
The breach just makes it visible.

STEVE:
Builder translation:
If your stack needs five vendors, three dashboards, and a priest to keep it running—
the problem isn’t hackers.

Hospitals need reliability, not spectacle.
Anything that increases cognitive load without reducing failure modes is a liability.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Detected: recurring headline loop.
Detected: local operators unsurprised.
Conclusion: narrative amplification > operational insight.

ILLUMINA:
The story comforts distant audiences.
The cost lands nearby.

Those closest to the systems already adjusted their expectations.
That’s how you can tell where reality actually is.

PAUL:
Exactly.
If it doesn’t change how care is delivered here, it’s just noise.

We watch it, log it, laugh a little—and keep reality as the reference.

For me, IMHO....


Bill: I Don't Want To Grow Up. 

He contributed two of the band's best songs here, ""Good Good Things"" and ""Silly Girl"". Every album has a great Bill gem, but both of those on the same album? Damn 

Milo: Enjoy! 

He grew as a songwriter AFTER the hiatus imo, but I still think ""Get The Time"" is his best song.

Karl:  Cool To Be You 

Karl honestly has penned a lot of great bangers and his stuff on ""Everything Sucks"" is arguably just as good (""I'm The One"" and ""Thank You"", nuff said), but I love how ""'Merican"" is basically like if the Descendents tried to make a Bad Religion song (that's a huge compliment, fwiw) while still staying very much the Descendents, and I may be alone here but the title track is probably the one time a Descendents song has made me shed a couple of tears 

Stephen: Everything Sucks

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

I took 7x 500mg pills of Ciprofloxacin. My first symptom was pain in my left Achilles followed by tingling/burning feet. The first two months were hell! I had horrible anxiety and a lot of CNS symptoms. I felt fine at 3 months to be honest. I went on a road trip with my girlfriend and drank beer, coffee, and even smoked some cigs. However in my 4th month the floxing came back with a vengeance and I got a whole host of cns issues. I then realised that my body will need more time to heal than what I had imagined previously. A lot of that has calmed down now. I’m still not at 100% and I’m expecting some sort of flare eventually but overall I’m doing pretty well at the minute. Which is something I honestly didn’t think I’d be saying a month ago. A lot of the intense symptoms I had in the first few months have settled down, and day-to-day life feels much more manageable now.

That said, I’m not 100% yet. My main lingering issues are:

\- Stiff tendons in my lower legs, especially noticeable after rest or first thing in the morning

\- Heart palpitations, which still come and go. It seems like they trigger upon waking up

\- Itchy / crawling sensations over different parts of my body that flare up at times

\- My gut health is also pretty bad atm, I don’t know if that’s contributing to the itchy feelings

\- I still get pains at random locations on my body 

These symptoms are annoying and sometimes unsettling, but they’re nowhere near as overwhelming as they were earlier in recovery. I’m able to function, get through my days, and mentally I’m in a much better place than before.

Recovery definitely hasn’t been linear — I’ve had waves and setbacks — but looking back over the full six months, there’s been clear overall improvement. I’m trying to stay patient and avoid going crazy with exercises and unhealthy habits. I need to let my body continue to heal at its own pace. 

I actually just went to an appointment with my GP. I told him about my 6 months of symptoms. I was prescribed cipro by supposed ‘specialist’ urologist for a ‘just in case’ infection. He even made me sign a waiver for the cipro! I feel stupid for even taking it. My GP was shocked to hear this. He even knew about floxing and believed me when I told him my symptoms. I just recently did a full panel of bloods just to be safe. He told me the side effects will go away in time but it could take a while. 

For anyone earlier in this journey: improvement can happen, even if it’s slow and uneven. These things just take time. I’m hoping the next few months bring further healing for all of us.

When I got there on my first day, I was in the back the whole time making and preparing food and washing dishes.  Training was minimum, it was usually just my manager (the one “training” me)  telling me to do something, not showing me how to do it, then getting mad at me if I did it wrong. Then on my 2nd day, I still was not being trained to make any coffees or drinks, I was in the back again with the cooks making food. I was not given an employee ID of any kind, I was not shown how or where to clock in, I don’t know if I’m even getting paid for this training. Overall it was a really odd experience if anything the job I was doing was closer to a cook than a barista. This is definitely not what I signed up for and not how the manager described the job.

1qda1kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qda1kd/i_dined_in_the_woodland_theater/,I Dined in the Woodland Theater,"I thought my aunt had helped me with the security deposit, but the little house I rented didn't have a landlord. She was a liar. The little envelopes of cash I mailed every month went to her. To one of her other little houses.

""I was helping you save. For after.""

This was a special courtesy, I suppose reserved for family.

The first September, I liked my little house. It was old, and the chipped gray paint reminded me of wool. All the brass fixtures had worn from where hands have touched over the years.  
The water dispensed from a well and the mineral smell was pleasant. Couldn't drink it though. I bought all my water in gallon jugs from the convenience store. It was the closest shop for a couple of miles.

When the wind picked up in October, the sound was shallow enough to mistake for the leaves. The house was bordered on all sides by woods and sat behind the road against 80 acres of privately owned preserve.

By Halloween, the sound had picked up and I thought it might've been trick-or-treaters. That night, I kept checking through the blinds over and over. I thought I was going mad because there wasn't a single kid in sight. No chaperones, no bands of teenagers.

By 11 PM, it was only getting louder.

Anxiety got the best of me and I grabbed my keys, threw open the door, ran down the steps, and jumped in my truck. There had to be someone, even though there were no streetlights on that road. About a mile down the road, when I cracked the windows for air, it was clear for the first time.

Like applause in a ballroom, from everywhere.  
Men and women's voices in commending tones, glasses tapping against plate rims.

By the last mile I'd worked myself into partial visibility. My eyes have always watered when nervous. I still hate this about myself. It's like cowardice leaking from my head.  
I nearly parked sideways in the convenience store lot.

""Yeah?""

Jesse, the clerk, said. I must've been standing for a moment too long inside the door.

""You don't hear that?""

I asked her before realizing the sound had stopped.

November 1st, I called my aunt again. She didn't pick up after I'd gotten home the night before. My claims were brushed off as ""holiday spirit after too many spirits,"" after I'd admitted to having a few drinks. We didn't speak again until Thanksgiving. I'd thought with her whimsical nature she'd be more receptive to my story. This frustrated me. I didn't know it yet but I was frustrated for the wrong reasons.

Throughout the month I was beyond shaken. I began to hear it during the daytime. It was inconsistent but more frequent. The first morning that it came, I didn't believe something so dreamlike could happen in the light.

I awoke to cheers outside my window and echoing clacks of string instruments settling against floorboards. I bolted upright and slapped my curtain aside. Nothing was there except for the stretch of grass before the tree line.

By the 16th I called out of work. It was too much to hear it while making coffee and then pretend things were normal. I called out on the 17th too. This was unlike me but my supervisor didn't make things difficult.

During those days I mostly waited. Then moved, then waited. I sat on the couch with the window cracked. Once I heard the applause I stood and put my ear to the sill. It stopped.  
I laid on my bed until it sounded again but once I stepped into the living room, it stopped. When it was quiet for a while, around noon, I went outside and sat on the side-porch steps.

I sat for an hour. The bare branches of the hickory trees clacked together close to the sky, in a wind so gentle. Feeling very settled I concentrated on my pulse, rhythmic and steady.  
The gravel soft and loose under my shoes. It was a rare moment of stillness for me. Contentment.

A sudden gust came and the sound erupted from beyond the trees. So much laughter, from the gut and bottom of the lungs. A crowd erupting in response to what must've been the most outrageous thing ever said. A hundred chairs creaked as if bodies were shifting back and forth, glasses shook as hands slammed down on clothed wooden tables.

I jolted forwards and fell to the dirt from the porch step. The laughter crescendoed. I nearly snapped my neck looking in all directions. At this point, it was the most frightened I'd ever been. Eyes wide, hot and watery. The tears escaped down my cheeks as I scrambled backwards towards my door.

1qd9u0w,https://i.redd.it/jhl1a96oxfdg1.png,1 year old raptor puppy going through a nipping biting and bad behavior phase. What signs should I look out for and how do I nip this in the bud now before it gets worse?,"Meet Freddy! He's a very sweet, 1-1.5 year old boy as a best guess. Recently, he seems to have regressed his behavior and I'm sure I overlooked some things that allowed it to progress to a problem.

Quick background: we live with my folks because I fell on hard times and they let me move back in. They already had 2 seniors (a 14 year old mutt and a 9 year old husky) and then Freddy got added to the mix (don't ask, it's a long story that complicates everything).

I work 2 jobs. I have a 7-4 (which is really a 6-5 with the commute) and, sometimes I work for the mermaid coffee company from 5-10:30pm. This leaves my folks to take care of Freddy during the day. My dad is disabled but he's able to take the huskies to the dog park in the mornings and then the dogs mostly just sleep and get restless before dinner at 4:45-5pm. My mom WFH but she's very busy and can't have Freddy causing chaos and consternation post-dinner.

Lately, he also has had some behavior issues where he seems calm and then goes a little bezerk. I admit to being part of the problem because I roughhouse with him and get him excited. He's also gotten very nippy, especially with my mom. She's threatened to take him to the shelter as soon as he fully bites her. Yes, she is aware that that is a death sentence. It's not fair to anyone in the house to have him be a problem and bite people and I don't have any wiggle room here.

I have not taken him to training class because my work schedule has been so all over the place, but my mom also keeps dissuading me from doing so. She doesn't think it'll help.

**Potential questions**:
**Can I move out?** I don't have the finances to do so at the moment, let alone find a place that'll take a 50lb husky.

**How much exercise does he get?** In the mornings, it's about an hour at the dog park and then home, where he just chills out and he seems fine (as reported by my dad). In the evenings, he and the other husky will often go for about a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood. With me, it's longer, and I let them run around the park off leash and then we walk home. On good weather weekends, I try to take him for longer hikes, in which case he loses his furry little mind. 

**Does he have toys, etc?** Yes! And he's a big chewer and he's destroyed most of them. I got him the hard plastic, which he loves, but he cracked a tooth, so that's out. He loves chewing, but I'm trying to avoid costly vet bills with his teeth, so I don't want to buy rawhide or bones or anything. He's had the rawhide alternative collagen chews, but those are gone in maybe 30 seconds. Nubz and other dental chews don't stand a chance. He's also destroyed two (three?) leashes.

**What other behavior modifications have I tried?** Leashing in-house; crating; redirecting to a toy; increased exercise; verbally/physically correcting (sharp no, clapping, pushing him off when he jumps, turning my back to him)


.

I've grown rather fond of Freddy. My last option to save his life is to preemptively surrender him to the shelter before he truly becomes a bite risk. I am willing to put in the work, but I'm just overwhelmed and part of me feels like I'm going at this alone and that I'm spinning in circles. I had two other dogs I raised from 12 weeks (the current 14 year old is one; the other died of cancer a few years ago) and I don't remember it being this hard. The other husky in the house is a stubborn PITA, but she's calm and getting calmer as she gets older. Freddy seems to be growing wilder. I admit this is my first time with a husky this young. Yes, I made a critical error in judgement when I adopted him in October. But how do I fix this here and now?",30,1768451304.0,husky,3,1.0,False

It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night.","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

1qd9t30,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qd9t30/rf_lovely_isnt_it/,"[RF] Lovely, isn't it?","The words were written with a shaky hand across a pack of Newports. I’ve never known if Newport 100s actually contained more tobacco or if they just burned a little slower. Surely there’s a study somewhere proving it one way, and another study contradicting it. To the eye, they look bigger, fuller, which raises a question I’ve asked myself more than once: if they cost the same, why buy shorts at all? Maybe that’s the game cigarette companies play, charge the same for less, so people convince themselves they’re making the “healthier” choice. Or buy the longer ones because you feel you are getting more for your money. Two types of people, really.



This pack, the one with the scribbled phrase, was the shorts. The man who owned it is dead now. Four cigarettes remain. He never got the satisfaction of finishing the last one. Smokers usually have a new pack waiting before the old one runs out, but maybe he wasn’t that type. Maybe he waited until he was down to his final two. The last cigarette in a pack always has a certain weight to it, almost as satisfying as the first, or the tenth. He was 62 when he died. By then, he’d had through so many firsts, lasts, and middles. I wonder if he noticed them as much as I do.



Most people, hearing of his death, would assume cancer. That’s the easy guess. But it wasn’t,  it was kidney failure. He didn’t even pick up smoking until his fifties, some late-life crisis or rebellion, who knows. Still, it’s easier for people to point to cigarettes. Habits are all we usually see of a person. It comforts the non-smoker: *He smoked, I don’t. That means I’m safe.* Smokers, on the other hand, will point to anything else.  Trying their best to rationalize the death as if it wasn’t related to smoking. I guess the smokers got the better end of this statistic.



But what I keep circling back to is that phrase: “Lovely, isn’t it?” Why write it on this pack? Did he write it on all of them, or just this one? If his family finds it while cleaning out his things, will they notice? Or will they just see the cigarettes and toss them in the trash? If he left other packs with other messages, they’ll vanish too, discarded with no second thought. Or will they notice? If so, would they raise concern? Would they look around the house for journals or check his phone and computer for anything that might lead to it. Or would they just say “it’s just so and so, he was just doing his own thing like always.”



His belongings will scatter over the coming days and months to different relatives and friends. His favorite chair will end up in a friend’s garage. His computer wiped clean, passed along to a nephew. His coffee cups and pour-over kit boxed up for an aunt’s best friend. The things he held onto, the objects that filled his days, will become background clutter in other people’s lives.



He never married. No children. A few long-term girlfriends, all of them remembering him kindly. Thoughtful, communicative, even-tempered. Yet for some reason or another, it never lasted. He held the same middle-management job for decades. Not rich, not poor. Always steady, always there. Survived rounds of layoffs and mergers and more layoffs and more mergers. When he died, the company replaced him within the week, announcing: *He would want us to keep working, to meet our KPIs.* Everything always moves forward, indifferent.



And yet the cigarettes stay in my memory, fixed. That single pack holds more questions than anything else he left behind. Maybe no one will ever understand why he wrote those words. Maybe he kept so much hidden that no one could. Perhaps he was waiting his whole life for someone he could truly share himself with, and never found them. If I had known him, I suspect I’d have only known the surface. The polite, steady version he showed to everyone else. I would never have seen the scrawl on the pack. That’s the paradox: the beauty lies in the imperfection. It’s not neat or clean. It’s fractured, ambiguous, maybe even meaningless. But that’s what makes it beautiful.



I can’t tell anyone about this. They’d laugh, or think I was overthinking. At best, they’d call it strange. So I keep it to myself. Share a fragment here, a half-thought there, but never the whole. And in that choice, I feel a little closer to him. Maybe we all live this way. Keeping our deepest thoughts folded tight in the dark, showing only the simple parts to others. And maybe that’s fine. Banter with friends, small joys with family, those moments refresh me. Why burden them with my depths when I don’t want to carry theirs?



Still, I can’t help but imagine what it would be like to share everything with one person. To have someone who understood me completely, where nothing had to be hidden. A space where doubts and fears and wild ideas could all be laid out without fear of judgment. The rush of it, two minds shaping each other, building something bigger together. Thoughts spilling into thoughts like water filling a carved divot in sand.



It sounds beautiful, but the thought of it terrifies me too. If I gave away everything inside me, would I lose myself? Would I be reshaped, brainwashed even, by such intimacy? That’s the tension we all live in. The endless calibration of what to give and what to hold back. It’s exhausting. It’s exhilarating. A pendulum swinging between quiet sadness and loud joy, always moving, always shifting under the light and shadow of each day.



I didn’t know this man. But I thank him. His pack of cigarettes made me pause, made me think. That’s what drew me in at first. Not the words, but the cigarettes themselves. I don’t buy brands. I roll my own. But I’ve always liked the feel of a pack in my hand. When I saw them sitting on the hospital bedside after he passed, I picked them up. Four left inside, waiting. Frozen in time.

I don’t have many connections here yet, so I’m looking to meet new people — maybe explore places, try some food spots, or just hang out and talk.
If you're in the city and open to connecting or grabbing a coffee, feel free to DM.
No expectations — just hoping to meet some genuine people.",1,1768451164.0,ahmedabad,2,0.6,False

When I suggested meeting up, she responded positively, but when I followed up with details, she stopped replying.

Months later, I’ll be in her city for work and briefly considered reaching (like coffee if she’s free). Wondering if this is reasonable or if the silence back then should be treated as a clear no. 

Curious how others would handle this.

when her phone sang and my name
was not the music.

I had offered her a circle—
small, honest, diamonds—
a vow you could knock against a glass,
a promise that would bruise the skin
and never disappear.
She smiled the way people do
when they are grateful for something
they do not want.

The Ring she wanted was a sound.
Not metal, not weight,
but the electric tremor of a call
lighting up her palm.
A ring that vanished the moment it arrived,
leaving no mark except
how quickly she turned away.

I learned the language of pauses.
How her laugh took an extra breath
after work.
How “just a coworker”
was said like a door
quietly closing.

In meetings and calendars and shared coffee,
another man held what I never could:
the power to interrupt her life
and be welcomed for it.
His ring fit perfectly—
slid into her day
without asking permission.

At night, her husband lay beside her,
my finger bare,
my heart loud.
I wondered how devotion could be so solid
and still lose to something
made of air and distance.

I realized then—
some people don’t want forever
wrapped around their hand.
They want the thrill of being chosen
again and again,
by someone who will never promise
to stay.

And so I mourned quietly,
not just the marriage,
but the man I was
when I still believed
love always preferred a shining ring
over a ringing sound.",1,1768451101.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

1qd9qg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qd9qg9/i_dined_in_the_woodland_theater_pt3/,I Dined in the Woodland Theater - PT.3,"Jesse's message confirmed my suspicions. Justified the twisted knot in my gut.  
I couldn't come back from that last glare my aunt shot across the dinner table. A relative had never studied me as a stranger. 

""I'll leave first thing in the morning I had some wine at dinner"" 

""Ok. Pick me up on the way. Big red house on Gun Shop Rd""

""DM don't knock""

After setting several alarms, I managed about two hours of sporadic sleep. Forcing myself awake at the first 5:30 AM chime was a struggle between physical comfort and logical action. The hangover malaise made the moments both blurry and anxious. 

Carefully, quietly, I lifted the old iron door latch. Applying just enough pressure as to not allow the parts to scrape. I pushed upwards on the handle so that the hinges wouldn't creak.  
The house was quiet. From the hallway I listened for signs of life. No coffee was percolating, the TV was off, no footsteps from the loft.  
With the coast clear, I made a hard right into the bathroom and didn't close the door. Those hinges groaned no matter what. My parents would always wake me in the mornings when they began their days up here. 

I relieved myself of last night's wine with a stream aimed as high in the bowl as manageable. Turning the faucet handle only an eighth of an inch, I collected the cold trickle of water in my cupped hands and slowly cleared the sleep from my face.

Having just arrived the night before, my bag was still fully packed. I slid my arms through my denim jacket sleeves and cautiously slung the duffel over my shoulder. Making my way down the hallway, slowly, I remained hyper vigilant for any stirring. In the moments it took to silently unlock the front door, I prayed softly that my car would survive a cold-start. Flurries had come down overnight which dampened the fallen leaves. Easier to make a quick and quiet walk across the driveway. As i hastened my pace, I smelled cigarette smoke. 

""Mornin' bud."" 

I halted, then turned to face Joe. Sitting on a birchwood bench, his rosacea popped against the A-frame's snow spackled facade.

""Hi Joe.""

""Your aunt is gonna be sad to find you gone.""

""Yeah I've just gotta get back. I don't want to wake her.""

Best I could come up with on the spot. 

""Listen bud, I don't remember what might've got said last night, but it's not worth runnin' off over."" 

I saw an opportunity. 

""Oh it was nothing bad. I think everyone just had a little too much you know?"" 

""Mhm.""

""Well... I wouldn't worry about it. I hope the rest of your weekend is nice.""

""I am worried... I'm worried about your aunt Max.""

The smoke form his cigarette tailed straight up. He sat there, staring at me. Still as a rock. 

""She's gonna be real upset if you just up and leave. Don't think I can bare to see it.""

""I'll give her a call when I get home. And make sure she knows we're all good.""

""Mm. Won't be no good. Why don't you come back inside? We'll get some breakfast going and everyone'll feel right as rain by noon.""

I thought for a moment. Weighed my options.

""Joe. I'm gonna head out.""

He took a slow drag and let the smoke out while shaking his head. I should've turned and left, but I couldn't bare to miss what was behind that expression.

""Joe?""

He spat.

""Don't listen too hard. Only gets louder when they think they've got ya."" 

He stubbed his cigarette in the snow and went back inside without looking at me. 

By the time I'd reached my exit I was cusping a panic attack. My aunt and Audrey were certainly up by then, Joe probably woke them with the news I'd fled. Part of me couldn't shake the thought that I'd made my aunt sad, but I had to remember that woman was hiding something from me. She knew something bad. She at least knew about the sound from the woods and lied about it. Why would she encourage me to live there if she knew? My head was spinning, and at the time, there were barely enough pieces to put together.

""Here""

As instructed, I DM'd Jesse while parked outside her house. I'd passed it before on the way to work. It was a newer construction compared to most of the homes it the county. Firehouse-red vinyl siding, big windows covered with black shudders, and a wraparound porch. Stuck out like a sore-thumb from between the trees.  
A wraparound porch seemed strange on a house so boxy and plain.  
  
The front door opened half way and Jesse slipped outside. She closed it carefully with a palm against the windowpane and her keys clutched tightly.  
It was strange not to see her in the usual convenience store polo. Our meetings were always so structured. Between eight to nine AM or five to six PM, in our respective uniforms.  
She got in the car quickly. The flush of winter air carried the scent of fabric softener and shampoo. Usually our talks took place between the hot dog roller and taquito warmer. 

""You good?""

I didn't know in what context she meant that. But no I wasn't. 

""Yeah, yeah... Where to?""

""You have breakfast yet?""

""No I just got in my car and drove."" 

""Go to the Denny's in Newburgh.""

""That's like twenty minutes away.""

""Yeah I don't want to talk about this in town.""

I took that very literally and remained quiet for the drive. She looked serious, intense. 

At breakfast she asked earnestly if I'd felt anything strange since moving to the area. I told her about the sound. As much as I didn't want to put her off, the circumstances made the admission feel normal. When she told me she's only ever heard it faintly, I was elated. Then I wasn't. Knowing I wasn't losing my mind was a momentary relief. But having the phenomenon confirmed, well it felt like the floor was dropping out.

""It's been happening since my parents were kids. We all get taught to ignore it.""

""How can you? I mean it's, it's impossible. It's impossible to ignore, but it's impossible that it's even happening at all."" 

""Our parents just said, 'the grown-ups are having a party'. I guess when you're trained to ignore something your whole life it just becomes regular. Like when your parents are talking serious and want you out of the room.""

""The whole 'not now the grown-ups are talking', yeah...""

""Don't get me wrong, you eventually realize something's off. Like Santa Claus. We try not to talk about it though, try not to give it any attention. But if we have to, we just call it The Party. Like, we won't go out after dark if the party's a little loud.""

I sat back in my seat to marinate on Jesse's anecdote. My head felt hot and the shared plate of hash browns were starting to look blurry. I got a little frustrated because I didn't want her to think I was about to cry.

""Why didn't you tell me when I came into the store on Halloween? I asked you if you heard anything.""

""Well I thought you might've heard *it*. But outsiders usually don't. And you didn't give me too much to go on, so I didn't want to take the chance and open that door.""

I quietly accepted her reasoning. We both took sips from our mugs and glanced around uneasily. She gave me ample time to process until I finally asked the big question. Selfishly, I hesitated. Because whatever her answer was, I wouldn't be able to unlearn it.

""How do you know my aunt?""
