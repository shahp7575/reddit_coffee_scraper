1i9lpfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9lpfo/end_of_an_7_years_relationship/,End of an 7 years relationship,"Hey all first time here. 

Just felt the needs to share somewhere not really expecting anything just to put my thoughts out! 

Me and my girlfriend since 2018 just broke up by mutually agreement after about 2 years of not being properly in sync with each other, we have a 2 year old beagle and we haven't made any decisions on what happens next. 

I've come to reliase that I am a toxic person, emotionally ignorant let's say. 

I have past trumas from my childhood regarding my alcoholic father and lots of insecurities because of some health conditions I had. 

I am now in teraphy with a psichiatrist and also in the process of most likely being diagnosed with adhd. 

I do did not know how to show my support for her in some difficult occasions and I didn't even realise that (that's why I say I am emotionally ignorant at the moment ). 

I didn't know how to support her the way she needed when her grandmother died, for example, I know I did help in many things but failed in others like a proper emotional support and check ins. Something I didn't realise probably also because I don't know how to handle death. My dad died when I was 13 and I couldn't speak or be present in any room when they talked about him. 

I'm sad, mostly because I couldn't be the person she needed and I've hurt her because I didn't understand how to properly handle my emotions and support her the way she needed  when she was down. 

Mostly she said she felt she wasn't seen, that I didn't care for her. I though I did, but I can see why she says their and I agree that sometimes it would seem that way. 

This becomes very apparent when I look at my friends which are non existent except some cases.

We moved to a new city 2 years ago and I have no here that I would even ask out for a coffee because I really don't know anyone in those terms. 

I do have a few friends back home and in other countries where I've been, but they are very few and with some the relationship is losing track. 

The good thing is that she is an amazing woman and helped me learn all of this about myself so now I can work through these issues with teraphy while I figure out life on my own. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I really don't even except anyone to read it, we just made the division of ending few hours ago and I just needed to let it out somehow.

1i9lndn,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRPcharts/comments/1i9lndn/3_realistic_assumptions_about_xrps_potential_value/,3 Realistic Assumptions About XRP‚Äôs Potential Value,"If money makes the world go round, XRP might just be the oil that keeps it spinning smoothly‚Äîexcept this oil is measured in drops.

1. Gradual Banking Adoption
XRP won‚Äôt take over the financial system overnight. It‚Äôs more realistic to expect it to start with niche use cases, like cross-border remittances, handling just a slice of the trillions of dollars moved daily.
 
2. Liquidity Drives Value
For XRP to process $1 trillion in daily transactions, its price could rise to $19.60 per token, and for $5 trillion, it might need to hit $98. With a finite supply of 100 billion XRP (51 billion circulating), higher demand would naturally drive its price upward.

3. Divisibility Offers Flexibility
Thanks to its design, XRP can scale‚Äîeach token is divisible into 1,000,000 drops, making it practical for both large-scale and tiny transactions:

‚Ä¢ Small-scale use: $100 billion daily could push XRP to $1.96/token.

‚Ä¢ Moderate use: $1 trillion daily might set XRP at $19.60/token.

‚Ä¢ Widespread adoption: $5 trillion daily could raise its value to $98/token.

This flexibility ensures XRP can handle everything from settling massive bank payments to buying a cup of coffee (well, a drop of coffee).

Insight: XRP‚Äôs future value isn‚Äôt just about moving money; it‚Äôs about whether it can make the global financial system faster, cheaper, and more efficient. If the world‚Äôs banks start trusting it, the sky‚Äôs the limit‚Äîor should we say, the drops keep falling.

============

Many people struggle with weight. **Losing weight** can feel hard. Some people think about weird ways to lose pounds. **Cinnamon** in **coffee** is a new thing. Does it truly help? That is what I will write about. This writing is about the science behind it. **Does cinnamon** in **coffee** really work for weight loss? Many wonder. It is a question I will explore. I will look at if it is beneficial. I will check potential side effects. We can all learn something about this topic today. You can use my writing to help you. Learn how **cinnamon** can be used for **weight loss** with **coffee**. I will try my best to explain the important things.

Does Cinnamon in Coffee Aid Weight Loss?
----------------------------------------

Many wonder: will **cinnamon** in **coffee** actually help **weight loss**? The science is not so clear. **Cinnamon** has some compounds. These compounds may affect your body. One way is through **blood sugar** management. Some research shows **cinnamon** might help control **blood sugar**. Stable **blood sugar** can help with **weight loss**. **Cinnamon** also may have effects on the **metabolism**. This might help your body burn more calories. But, do not think that it will just magically fix all the **weight problems**. Good diet and exercise still matter a lot. This is not magic. It is more like a small help in big things. I will dig deeper for you. I will share the facts about **cinnamon** and **weight loss**. I am trying to see is it effective.

The Potential Benefits of Cinnamon for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------

### The Impact of Cinnamon on Blood Sugar Levels

**Cinnamon** is useful for people having trouble with **blood sugar**. **Cinnamon** can help the body respond to insulin. This response is called insulin sensitivity. When insulin works well, the **blood sugar** stays steady. If **blood sugar** goes up and down a lot, it can lead to problems. These can include weight gain. **Cinnamon** helps keep **blood sugar** level. This can help you with **weight loss**. When the sugar levels are balanced, you feel less hungry. You may also crave fewer snacks. The result is you take in less food. So **cinnamon** helps with sugar which in turn helps with **weight loss**. I will tell more about how much **cinnamon** is safe for you.

### Cinnamon's Role in Metabolism and Fat Burning

Many ask about **cinnamon** and metabolism. People think it could help with fat burning. Some theories suggest **cinnamon** might boost **metabolism**. This can help you burn calories faster. The body may start a process called thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is when the body produces heat and burns calories. **Cinnamon** may help with this process. So, the **metabolism** might work better. But, there is no very clear data, there are only theories. More research is needed to be sure. The benefit of **cinnamon** is not too much. However, it can be a small help with **weight loss**. I will tell how you can use **cinnamon** in a safe way.

How Much Cinnamon Should You Add to Your Coffee for Weight Loss?
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Recommended Cinnamon Dosage in Coffee

Now we come to an important question about quantity. How much **cinnamon** is good to add to **coffee** for **weight loss**? It is good to know this. There is no special correct amount. But, most people take about one teaspoon of **cinnamon** each day. You can begin with a smaller amount. For example, you can start with half a teaspoon. You can mix it in your **coffee**. See how your body reacts. If you feel okay, you can then slowly increase the amount. Be careful not to take too much in one day. Taking too much **cinnamon** can be dangerous. I suggest you start small and go slow.

### Different Cinnamon Forms for Coffee

There are different ways to use **cinnamon** in your **coffee**. You can use **cinnamon powder**. This is easy to mix in your **coffee**. It mixes easily with the drink. It gives a good flavor. **Cinnamon sticks** are another option. You can put them in your **coffee** while it is hot. This will add a nice subtle flavor. Both are good options. Just make sure you buy good-quality **cinnamon**. Check the ingredient label when buying the **cinnamon**. The freshness of the **cinnamon** is also important. Fresh **cinnamon** will give a better flavor to your **coffee**. I suggest you try both options. Use what you like best for your **coffee**.

Potential Side Effects and Precautions of Cinnamon in Coffee
------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to know the potential side effects of **cinnamon**. If you eat too much **cinnamon**, you may have problems. Some people may get stomach problems or irritation. This is not a common thing, but can happen. There is a substance in **cinnamon** called coumarin. Coumarin is very dangerous for the liver. So, people with liver issues must be very careful with **cinnamon**. Pregnant women need to be cautious. It is important to not take too much **cinnamon**. It is best to be cautious. You must listen to your body. If it feels like you are having side effects, stop using **cinnamon**. Moderation is very important.

Practical Ways to Include Cinnamon in Your Coffee for Weight Loss
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Cinnamon Coffee Recipe and Preparation Tips

Making **cinnamon coffee** is not difficult. You can add half or one teaspoon of **cinnamon powder** to your **coffee**. Do this before you add water. Or you can use **cinnamon** sticks in your **coffee** mug. If you want a sweet taste without sugar, try adding a few drops of stevia. It is an alternative to sugar and has very few calories. Mix it well with the **coffee**. Drink it when it is warm. You can also add a little milk if you like. The taste will be different and depends on you. If you like it stronger then add more **cinnamon**. Start with a small amount first. Enjoy your **cinnamon coffee** hot.

### Other Ways to incorporate cinnamon for weight loss

There are more ways you can use **cinnamon** for **weight loss**. You do not need only **coffee**. You can add **cinnamon** to your food. Mix it in your yogurt or oatmeal. You can sprinkle it on top of your fruit. Add **cinnamon** to baked food, like pastries. It will give a nice flavor. You can also take **cinnamon** in capsules. They are available at most health stores. Remember, **cinnamon** alone will not make you lose weight. You must have a balanced diet. You must do some regular exercise. If you do these things you can have **weight loss**. **Cinnamon** is just one part of a weight loss plan. Be creative with using **cinnamon**. You must be consistent too.

Optimizing Your Weight Loss Journey with Cinnamon Coffee
--------------------------------------------------------

**Cinnamon coffee** is not a fast solution for **weight loss**. It is not magic. It can help your body a little bit. But, to see real results you need a good diet. You also have to do some exercise. Do not think that only drinking **cinnamon coffee** will help. It is important to have a balanced approach. Eat healthy food. Do some regular activity like walking. Drink enough water everyday. These are essential to lose weight. **Cinnamon coffee** is just an extra. Do not make very high expectations of **cinnamon**. Be realistic and stay consistent with your healthy routine. It is better to aim for a balanced approach to weight management.

1i9l8zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1i9l8zc/quiet_life_pt_2/,Quiet Life Pt 2,"Marcus stared at the television, his eyes glazed over. The laugh track of a sitcom played in the background, a jarring juxtaposition to the horror he had wrought. The alcohol had been a crutch, a way to silence the taunts of his past and the noise of his present. But now, it was a liability. He couldn't risk the fog of a hangover, not with the police so close.

He went to the kitchen and filled a glass with water, downing it in one gulp. The cold liquid did little to soothe his parched throat, but it was a start. As he set the glass down, he caught his reflection in the window. The man staring back at him was a ghost, a mere shadow of who he once was. His hand trembled, and he clenched it into a fist to steady himself. He had to get a grip. The whiskey bottle was still there, on the floor, a silent sentinel to his descent.

He decided to clean the kitchen, hoping the repetitive motions would help clear his head. As he wiped down the counters, he noticed a smear of blood, a grim souvenir of his nocturnal escapade. Panic surged through him, and he grabbed a clean cloth, scrubbing furiously at the stain. The smell of bleach filled the room, a harsh contrast to the lingering scent of whiskey. He had to be thorough. He had to be careful.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus, feeling the weight of his recent actions, sits in his cleaned kitchen, watching a sitcom to distract from his guilt. His trembling hand and the whiskey bottle on the floor serve as stark reminders of his struggle. A police welfare check looms, prompting him to clean up a bloodstain, symbolizing his attempt to cover his tracks and maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the horror.

Once the kitchen was spotless, Marcus went to the living room and sat on the couch, his eyes darting around the room. The TV played on, the laughter a hollow echo of the joy that had once filled this space. The walls seemed to whisper of his dark secrets, threatening to give him away. He knew he couldn't stay here, not with the bodies of Larry and Tiffany hidden in plain sight.

He needed an alibi, a foolproof way to account for his whereabouts during the time of the murders. His thoughts turned to his old drinking buddies, the ones he had pushed away when his addiction took over. Could he trust them to cover for him? Or would they be the first to suspect? He picked up his phone, his thumb hovering over the contacts. The screen was a blur, his mind racing with possibilities.

He scrolled through the numbers, each name a potential lifeline. Finally, he settled on one: Dave. They hadn't spoken in months, but Marcus knew he owed him a favor. He took a deep breath and dialed, his heart pounding in his chest. The phone rang once, twice, three times before a sleepy voice answered.

""Dave, it's me, Marcus,"" he whispered, the words sticking in his throat. ""Look, I need your help. Something happened last night."" He paused, his mind racing. ""I was at your place, okay? We had a few drinks, and I crashed on your couch. You don't remember because you passed out. That's my story, alright?""

SUMMARY^1: Marcus contemplates the necessity of an alibi, fearful of the police investigation. He decides to use his old drinking buddy, Dave, as a cover. He calls him, creating a false story about being at Dave's place during the murders, hoping the lie will hold and provide the necessary distance from the suspicion that looms.

There was silence on the other end, and for a moment, Marcus feared he had made a mistake. Then, a sigh. ""Alright, man. Whatever you say. But you owe me big time.""

The words were a lifeline, a semblance of safety in a world that was quickly spiraling out of control. Marcus hung up, his hand shaking. He had bought himself some time, but it was only a matter of when, not if, the truth would come out. The silence of the house was a ticking clock, each second bringing him closer to discovery.

He had to act quickly. He needed to move the bodies, to make it look like an accident. His mind raced with the possibilities, the plans forming like shadows in the corners of his thoughts. He knew the neighborhood well, the old factory that had been abandoned for years, the river that flowed through the outskirts, a convenient disposal site for those who knew where to look.

Marcus took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. The sun was rising, casting long shadows across the floor. The house was waking up, the day stretching out before him like a prison sentence. He had to be smart, had to be careful. But as he stood up from the couch, his legs felt like lead. The weight of his actions pressed down on him, threatening to crush him beneath its inescapable gravity.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus calls his old friend Dave, establishing a false alibi for the night of the murders. He knows the truth can't stay buried forever, and the pressure builds as he considers his next move. The house's silence is a ticking clock, and he plans to relocate the bodies, aiming for a convincing accident scenario. The rising sun is a stark reminder of the dawning reality of his situation, weighing heavily on his shoulders.

He took one last look around the room, memorizing every detail, every potential clue. Then, with a resigned sigh, he turned off the TV and made his way to the basement. The water in the tub was still, a crimson pool that reflected the horror of his actions. Larry's body lay in the water, lifeless, a grotesque parody of peace. Marcus knew he had to act, had to keep moving. The whispers of guilt grew louder, but he pushed them down, focusing on the task at hand.

With trembling hands, he reached into the tub and began to untie the knots that held the cushions in place. The water was warm and sticky, the cushions heavy with the weight of death. He pulled them free, the water gurgling around him as Larry's body shifted, sending ripples across the surface. He stepped back, his eyes avoiding the corpse as he grabbed the plastic bag containing Tiffany's dismembered remains.

The trip to the dumpster was a blur, his mind racing with every step. The alley was still, the shadows holding their breath as he moved through them. The dumpster was a maw of darkness, the perfect receptacle for his sins. With a grunt, he heaved the bag inside, the plastic crunching against the metal. The lid slammed shut, a finality that echoed through the alley.

He stepped back, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of his presence. The delivery man's footsteps echoed in his memory, a reminder that the world was waking up to a day that had irrevocably changed for him. The sun had fully risen now, casting the alley in a harsh, unforgiving light. He took a deep breath, the scent of garbage mingling with the coppery tang of blood.

The police would come, of that he had no doubt. But for now, he had bought himself a little more time. He turned and walked back into the house, the silence of his footsteps a stark contrast to the cacophony in his mind. The whiskey bottle called to him from the floor of his room, a seductive whisper promising to dull the pain.

But Marcus knew he couldn't give in, not now. He had to keep moving, had to stay sharp. He grabbed the phone and called in sick to work, his voice a shaky imitation of his usual gruffness. Then, he began to pack a bag, filling it with essentials: a change of clothes, his wallet, and the TV remote. He had to get out, had to put distance between himself and the bodies.

He took one last look around the room, the whiskey bottle glinting in the light, a silent specter of his past. He left it there, a symbol of his old life, and stepped into the hallway. The floorboards creaked, a mournful tune that seemed to follow him. He closed the door to his room, the sound of the lock clicking into place a mournful echo.

The house was still, the silence a cocoon around him. He moved quickly, gathering his things, the fear of discovery a constant companion. As he descended the stairs, the sunlight spilled in through the windows, painting the walls a warm gold. For a moment, he allowed himself to believe that he could leave it all behind, that he could start anew.

But as he stepped outside, the cold reality of his situation hit him like a slap in the face. The world had not stopped turning, the laughter of children playing in the street a mocking contrast to the darkness in his soul. He knew he couldn't outrun the truth, not forever. The bodies would be found, and the whispers would start. He was a killer now, a man with secrets that would never truly die.

He walked to the bus stop, the bag heavy on his shoulder. The TV remote dug into his side, a constant reminder of the lives he had taken. The bus pulled up, its engine purring with the promise of escape. Marcus climbed aboard, the diesel fumes mixing with the scent of his own fear. He took a seat in the back, his eyes on the world outside the window.

The city rolled by in a blur of concrete and steel, a testament to the lives lived and lost. The sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat of the day seeping into his bones. He knew he had to keep moving, had to find a place to hide, to think. But as the bus lurched forward, carrying him away from the scene of his crimes, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

He glanced around the bus, his eyes meeting the gazes of the other passengers. They were just faces in the crowd, but to him, they were judges and jurors, ready to condemn him at a moment's notice. His palms grew slick with sweat, and his breath came in shallow gasps. The whispers of his guilt grew louder, drowning out the murmur of the engine.

Marcus stepped off the bus at the next stop, his legs shaking with the effort of maintaining his composure. He wandered aimlessly, the buildings closing in around him like a maze with no exit. The heat was oppressive, the air thick with the scent of exhaust and despair. He needed a new plan, a way to disappear. The TV was a beacon of hope, a ticket to a new life, if he could just figure out how to use it.

He found a quiet alley, the shadows a comforting embrace. He sat on the ground, the TV remote clutched in his hand like a talisman. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing the panic to subside. The whispers grew fainter, and he could almost feel the beginnings of a plan forming in his mind.

He would sell the TV, get some cash, and leave town. He had a friend in the next state over, a man named Jerry who owed him a favor. He could lie low there, build a new life, away from the prying eyes of the police and the specter of his past. The thought brought a glimmer of hope, a spark in the abyss of his fear.

But first, he had to ditch the evidence, the bloody couch cushions and the plastic bag that held the grisly remains of his former neighbors. He found a dumpster, the stench of rotting food a welcome distraction from his own odor of death. He heaved the cushions in, the sound of them landing with a wet thud echoing in the alley. The bag with Tiffany followed, a final goodbye to the life he had destroyed.

Marcus stood for a moment, his eyes closed, listening to the fading sounds of the city. The sirens in the distance grew louder, a symphony of chaos that seemed to be closing in on him. He had to move quickly, had to vanish before the noose tightened.

With a newfound urgency, he hailed a taxi, the TV remote still clutched in his hand. He gave the driver an address, a random number on a street he had never been to before. The car pulled away from the curb, the engine a soothing lullaby as the city blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors.

In the taxi, the whispers grew faint, the guilt a distant memory. For now, he was free, a man on the run with the wind in his hair and the world at his fingertips. But he knew it wouldn't last. The shadows of his past would always follow him, a relentless pursuer that would never tire.

He had to be smarter, had to stay one step ahead. As the car sped through the streets, he began to formulate a new identity, a new life. He would become someone else, leave Marcus and his demons behind. The TV remote was his key to a fresh start, a gateway to a world of anonymity and escape.

The taxi pulled up to a pawnshop, the neon sign flickering in the early morning light. Marcus stepped out, the bag with the TV remote in his pocket. The bell jingled as he pushed open the door, the smell of stale cigarette smoke and dusty dreams enveloping him. He approached the counter, his heart racing, and laid the remote on the grimy glass.

The pawnbroker looked him over, his eyes shrewd and assessing. ""What's the story with this?"" he asked, his voice gravelly from years of hard living.

Marcus forced a smile, the lie coming easily to his lips. ""It's just a TV remote,"" he said, the words tasting like ash. ""It's not worth much, but I need the cash.""

The pawnbroker studied the remote, then nodded. ""Fifty bucks,"" he said, sliding the money across the counter.

Marcus took the cash, the feel of it in his hand a strange comfort amidst the chaos. He had to be smart now, had to play the part of the desperate man with nothing to hide. He pocketed the money and left the pawnshop, the bell chiming a tune of both liberation and finality. The cash burned a hole in his pocket, a siren song of escape beckoning him westward.

He bought a bus ticket at the station, choosing a route that would take him as far from the city as possible. The line to the counter was long, a serpentine of people with their own stories of despair and hope. He waited, his eyes darting from face to face, searching for any sign of recognition or suspicion. But all he saw were the weary expressions of those trapped in their own struggles, oblivious to the monster in their midst.

The bus ride was a blur of passing scenery and racing thoughts. He had to stay off the grid, find a place where no one would look for him. He had to become someone else, erase every trace of Marcus from existence. The whispers of his past grew fainter with each mile, replaced by the rumble of the engine and the hiss of tires on asphalt.

When the bus finally pulled into a small town, Marcus knew he had found his refuge. The streets were quiet, the buildings old and weathered. It was a place where the world had moved on, leaving behind a quiet dignity that whispered of forgotten secrets and second chances. He stepped off the bus, the warmth of the sun a stark contrast to the cold grip of fear that had held him for so long.

The local diner was a beacon of light, the scent of greasy food and strong coffee a balm to his frayed nerves. He took a seat at the counter, the vinyl stool sticking to his skin. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with a kind smile, brought him a cup of coffee without asking. Her eyes held a knowing look, as if she had seen men like him before, men running from their own shadows.

He took a sip, the liquid scalding his throat, grounding him in the present. For a moment, he allowed himself to feel the warmth of human connection, the comfort of anonymity. But as he glanced at the TV above the counter, the news flashed a story of a gruesome murder, the image of Larry and Tiffany's house plastered on the screen. The whispers grew louder, the noose tightening once more.

Marcus's hand trembled, the cup rattling against the saucer. The waitress's eyes flicked up to meet his, a question in her gaze. He forced a smile, the muscles in his cheeks aching with the effort. ""Just tired,"" he murmured, pushing the coffee away. He couldn't stay here, not now. The whispers had become a roar, a siren's call that would lead the authorities straight to him.

With a heavy heart, he stood up, the TV's chatter a cacophony of accusations. He had to keep moving, had to find a place where the whispers couldn't follow. He stepped out into the sun-drenched street, the TV's remote still in his pocket, a silent testament to the life he had left behind. The world waited for him, vast and unknowable, full of danger and potential.

He walked towards the horizon, the sun a blinding spot in the sky. His steps were unsteady, his breathing ragged. The town grew smaller in the distance, a mirage of a life he could never have. The whispers grew faint, the fear a dull throb in his chest. Marcus knew he couldn't outrun the truth forever, but for now, he had a head start.

The road ahead was long, the future uncertain. But as he disappeared into the horizon, the whispers of his past grew quieter, the promise of a new identity beckoning him onward. The TV remote was a reminder of the life he had stolen, but also a symbol of the power to rewrite his own story.

And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in shadows, Marcus took the first step into his new life, the echoes of his past fading with each stride. The quiet of the evening was a balm to his soul, the silence a promise of a life untainted by the cackling laughter of his demons. He had survived the night of blood and whispers, and now, he had to survive the aftermath.

He found a small, dilapidated motel on the outskirts of the next town. The neon sign flickered, the letters spelling out ""VACANCY"" in a seductive dance of light. Marcus approached the office, his heart hammering in his chest. The clerk, an old man with a world-weary gaze, barely looked up as he handed over the key. The room was a sanctuary, the worn-out bed and peeling wallpaper a stark contrast to the gleaming TV that dominated the space.

He turned it on, the static a comforting white noise that drowned out the whispers. The news played in the background, but he couldn't bring himself to watch it. Instead, he stared at the wall, his mind racing with the what-ifs and hows. How long could he keep this up? Would he ever find peace?

The knock on the door startled him, sending his heart into a frenzy. He approached it, his hand on the knob, his breath shallow. When he peeked through the peephole, he saw a young girl, her eyes wide with fear. She clutched a plastic bag, her knuckles white. ""Please,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I need help.""

The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of doubt and suspicion. He knew he should turn her away, keep moving, stay hidden. But something in her eyes, a flicker of innocence lost, called to him. He opened the door, the chill of the evening air a slap to the face. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice gruff, unused to kindness.

Her story spilled out, a tale of a world crueler than he could ever imagine. Her father had gone missing, leaving her alone with a mother who had turned to drugs and abuse. Marcus felt a twinge of pity, a spark of something he thought he had lost. He offered her a bed for the night, a sandwich, and the quiet refuge of his room.

As they sat on the bed, the TV playing a mindless sitcom, she talked of her dreams, her hopes, her fears. The whispers grew quieter, drowned out by the steady rhythm of her voice. And for a brief moment, Marcus allowed himself to feel something other than the cold grip of guilt. He saw in her a reflection of himself, a soul adrift in a sea of chaos.

When she finally fell asleep, her head on his shoulder, the TV still playing, Marcus sat in the darkness, the weight of his actions pressing down on him. He knew he couldn't save her, couldn't save anyone. But he could give her a night of peace, a small reprieve from the horrors that awaited her outside.

The whispers grew faint, the TV's glow a comforting presence in the gloom. He sat there, the remote in his hand, the power to change the channel a symbol of his dwindling control over his own fate. But as the night stretched on, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. He knew that soon, the past would catch up with him, the bodies would be found, and the hunt would begin anew.

With a heavy sigh, Marcus stood up, the girl's head rolling onto the pillow. He knew he had to go, had to leave before the whispers grew too loud to ignore. He gathered his things, the TV remote a silent witness to the brief connection he had allowed himself. He stepped out into the night, the motel's neon glow a beacon of the life he had left behind.

The stars above twinkled like a thousand accusatory eyes, but he ignored them, focusing on the road ahead. The whispers had become a constant companion, a reminder of the lives he had taken and the price he would pay. But for now, he had to keep moving, had to stay one step ahead of the inevitable.

The night was long, the miles stretching out before him like a black ribbon of uncertainty. The TV remote felt heavier with each step, a burden that weighed on his soul. But it was also a reminder of the power to choose, to rewrite his story. And so, he walked into the darkness, the whispers of his past a fading echo, the promise of a new dawn a beacon in the distance.",1,1737805449.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

On my commute I was thinking about what Suzerain countries would provide new and Interesting mechanics to the game and lead to scenarios we haven‚Äôt seen before. One thing led to another and now I‚Äôve written about 12 pages of notes on a DLC set in the country of Nibiya in Rika. I like this idea as it would be very different from both Sordland and Rizia, allowing us to be in a weak, poor, and unstable nation ‚Äì beset with ethnic and religious tensions while trying to decolonize itself. So please give it a read and let me know your thoughts‚Ä¶ and if anyone from Torpor‚Äôs reading this, please hire me, thank you :D

**A quick note on names: I used a name generator to come up with many of the names, and unfortunately, I‚Äôm pretty sure the African names I‚Äôve used are almost certainly Rowling-esque blends of various cultures that make no sense to anyone from Africa or the Middle East ‚Äì so I apologize greatly for that. Just imagine the names as placeholders.**

# Synopsis

The year is 1948. You are **Colonel Kaithen Faris**, the leader of a five-man military junta that has just seized control of Nibiya‚Äîa nation scarred by religious and ethnic divisions, haunted by a history of brutal colonization and settlement by foreign powers. As northern Rika descends into chaos and civil war, global superpowers circle like vultures, eager to exploit the turmoil. Meanwhile, remnants of the old colonial elite fight to preserve their privileges, nationalist factions strive to break free from the past, and ancient tribal leaders maneuver to restore their lost influence. Can Kaithen navigate the ruthless power struggles within The Junta, defeat domestic uprisings, outsmart foreign conspiracies, and balance the demands of his own family to lead Nibiya into a new era?

# Nibiya

The Union of Nibiya is a country located in northern Rika, with a population of 28 million divided among four major ethnic groups: the **Narebi** (40%) who inhabit the interior, the **Zhanga** (30%) settled along the coastline (also found in neighboring Democratic Zanza and Zaerland), the **Doumon** (15%) in the eastern border region, and the **Valgo-Rikans** (10%), descendants of colonial settlers. Religiously, the population is split between followers of **Nurity** and **Mossamism** (an equivalent to Islam), though indigenous animist traditions remain influential. The capital and largest city is Jamir. Nibiya's economy is centered on **uranium mining**, **rubber cultivation**, **fishing**, and the **textile industry**.

The roots of modern Nibiya trace back to the medieval Kingdom of Nibiya, which existed from the 10th to the 17th century CE, before the Valgish Empire began its colonization. Many Valgs migrated to the region, establishing cotton and rubber plantations. In 1732, the Colony of South Zaerland was formally created as a sister colony to North Zaerland. After the Valgish Revolution in 1920, both colonies declared themselves as independent republics under the rule of its minority Valg population.

Following the 1930s Rikan Emergency (a series of violent anti-colonial uprisings in Rika) and the establishment of the Rika Independence Process by the Alliance of Nations, political power gradually transitioned to a new supposedly democratic government led by the National Movement for Free Nibiya (NMFN), resulting in the creation of the Union of Nibiya. However, by 1948, mounting unrest and widespread dissatisfaction with the NMFN government prompted the military to seize power, installing a military junta.

# The Prologue

Kaithen is born in 1909 in a rural village in Nibiya, then known as South Zaerland, a colony of the Valgish Empire. He belongs to the Narebi ethnic group, the largest ethnic group in Nibiya. His family status within the village varies, depending on the player's choice: he can be the grandson of the village leader, the son of a local animist religious figure, or a simple peasant farmer. As a child, he witnesses how his village spends part of the year working on rubber plantations controlled by the Valgish Colonial Authorities. He attends a school run by the Valgish Nurist Mission in Rika, where he faces a pivotal decision: to adopt Nurism, cling to his village‚Äôs traditional animist beliefs (and face punishment), or embrace atheism.

In 1920, the Valgish Revolution erupts. Valgish settlers in Nibiya declare independence, establishing the Republic of South Zaerland, though power remains firmly in the settlers' hands. As the state grows increasingly authoritarian, tensions rise between the indigenous population and the Valgish rulers. Local disputes also flare, including a conflict over fishing rights between Kaithan's village and the neighboring Zangha village, the second-largest ethnic group. Depending on player choices, Kaithan may find himself involved in clashes with Zangha youths. When his village leader (possibly his grandfather) is killed, a new leader is elected.

By 1926, Kaithan joins the colonial military, where his leadership potential is recognized. He advances as far as a Rikan can within the racially stratified military. During this period, a pro-independence group called the National Movement for Free Nibiya (NMFN) gains popularity, advocating for self-rule.

In 1934, the Rikan Emergency begins with a CSP-backed rebellion in the neighboring Lespian colony of Cabo Zanza. Lespian's failed intervention triggers widespread unrest across the continent. Atrocities committed by both settlers and indigenous forces escalate tensions across Rika's colonies, including South Zaerland. Uprisings break out, and Kaithan must choose whether to follow orders and suppress a local riot.

In response to mounting pressure, the Valgish-dominated government agrees to gradual decolonization. In 1937, power is transferred to the NMFN, which renames the country Nibiya. Under the new government, Kaithan rises to the rank of colonel, commanding a special infantry brigade: the Nibiyan Light Infantry. His growing influence enables his younger brother, Saif, to assume leadership of their village.

During the 1940s, dissatisfaction with the NMFN government intensifies. Economic stagnation, entrenched wealth inequality favoring the Valgish elite, and the political dominance of the Zangha people fuel public resentment. A communist revolutionary movement gains traction, raising fears of a civil war akin to the bloody conflicts engulfing neighboring Zanza and Dorghuk.

Amid this unrest, Kaithan and four fellow military colonels, each driven by their own ambitions and concerns, decide to act. After months of secret planning, they execute a successful coup d'√©tat, toppling the NMFN government. They establish a military junta known as the Committee for National Salvation (CNS), seizing control of Nibiya‚Äôs future.

# Mechanics

**Currencies**

You have three main currencies you can spend in the DLC ‚Äì Political Capital, Budget, Personal Wealth. Of these **Political Capital** is the most important and represents your personal ability to persuade people. It is basically your reputation; leaning too hard on it, trying to ‚Äúpull rank,‚Äù or taking actions viewed as morally reprehensible can obviously damage it, but helping people out or doing things that are popular (or rather look popular, even if they aren‚Äôt necessarily beneficial long-term) can raise it. Managing your Political Capital is essential if you are going down the Charismatic route.

**Budget** represents the treasury of Nibiya. It can be spent or raised at various points of the game. Compared to Sordland and Rizia, Nibiya is a poor country. It also has less capacity to go into debt compared to Sordland as lenders are less willing to let Nibiya borrow money.

**Personal Wealth** represents your own personal funds, which again can be acquired or spent at various points in the game. Due to the high levels of corruption within Nibiya, sometimes personal wealth can serve as a substitute for Political Capital ‚Äì it is therefore of even more importance than in the base game.

**Legitimacy & Unrest**

Legitimacy is a key stat in the game and represents both domestic and international support for the military government. If this gets too low, civil war is more likely to break out. Maintaining a high degree of legitimacy is a must for the new government.

Unrest specifically represents regional dissatisfaction with the government. High unrest can lead to regional uprisings if combined with low legitimacy. Deployment of military forces can quell unrest although it might have consequences down the line.

**Military Deployment and Equipment**

The main new mechanic introduced in the DLC is the ability to deploy soldiers to different regions of the country, similar to the war mechanic in Rizia. Deploying soldiers helps quell unrest but also fight enemies in that region, be they foreign mercenaries, mutinying soldiers, or local rebellions.

Different units have different specializations and quality, and you can also control how they are equipped, drawing from a finite pool of equipment. Deploying soldiers costs political capital, the central currency of this DLC. Deploying your own soldiers costs the least political capital (but could leave you personally vulnerable), while trying to deploy units under the command of the other members of The Junta costs more, depending on their relationship to you.

Should violence break out between the members of The Junta, the position, equipment, and quality of the units will prove decisive in choosing a victor.

Kaithen can grow his own powerbase of soldiers, particularly by drawing on manpower from his home region, provided his relationship with them remains positive.

# Factions and Characters

The following are the primary factions that must be appeased or dealt with for The Junta to survive.

**The Old Colony**

This is the population of Valgish settlers responsible for colonizing Nibiya during the days of the Valgish Empire. Eager to avoid the bloodshed that claimed neighboring Zanza, they agreed to a process of gradually ceding political power to the indigenous population; they were able to find amenable partners in the National Movement for Free Nibiya. They are among the richest citizens in Nibiya and control much of the land and in particular the key Rubber and Textile industries, much to the chagrin of many indigenous Nibiyans. Far from being sympathetic to the socialist revolution of their homeland, the Valgish have a vested interest in getting Arcasia and other ATO states invested in Nibiya, hoping to make the superpower a guarantor of their protection within the country, despite their apparent opposition to the liberal ideals of the Arcasian republic. They are increasingly interested in the possibility of deploying Arcasian private military contractors to protect their property within Nibiya.

The Old Colony is represented by the character of **Hans-G√ºnther Von Caprivi**, the largest landowner in Nibiya and son of the last Valgish Governor of South Zaerland.

**The Liberators**

The Liberators is the name for the coalition of activists, intellectuals, journalists, and politicians who believe the decolonization of Nibiya is not yet complete. Many were members of the National Movement for Free Nibiya but later left after becoming disillusioned with the slowness of the decolonization process and by the retained influence of the Old Colony. They wish to see a Nibiya that is self-sufficient, controlled by its indigenous population, and capable of resisting foreign influence. They also wish to diversify and modernize the Nibiya economy to be less reliant on primary extractive industries. Many have socialist ideals but while there are some ties with United Cortana and the CSP, many do not trust the superpower to be a totally benevolent patron of their new nation. Increasingly radicalized, many are increasingly believing that violence might be the only way to remove the influence of the Old Colony and seize the destiny of their country.

The Liberators are represented by **Walyd Beringer**, party leader for the Liberation Vanguard, a radical communist party within the Nibiyan Congress.

**The Tribal Elite**

The Tribal Elite refers to a caste of chiefs, elders, religious figures, and family patrons who wield an incredible amount of ceremonial and informal power within Nibiyan society. Although Nibiya has a long history of its own rulers and legal systems, the so-called Tribal Elite system emerged alongside Valgish colonization, as the colonial power created tribal elites with which to rule through the indigenous population. Regardless, many Nibiyans do view the Tribal Elite as holding a great deal of authority and legitimacy and therefore their influence cannot be disregarded.

The Tribal Elite view the Liberators‚Äô vision of the modernized Nibiyan state with suspicion, seeing it as a threat to their traditional power and also a path to societal and moral decay. They wish to see a return to old ways of Nibiyan society, an agricultural society built around trust in one‚Äôs community, elders, and neighbors. The Tribal Elite is represented by **Zaher Nima Naaji**, the Zhanga Prince of Sunsa. However, two other characters: **Saif Faris** (Kaithen‚Äôs brother) and **General Salah** (Kaithen‚Äôs colleague in The Junta) also play a role in representing the opinions of the Narebi and Doumon respectively.

**Additionally, there are two other factions that have specific importance to the position of Kaithen Faris.**

**The Nibiyan Light Infantry**

A brigade-sized special infantry unit of the Nibiyan Army under the command of Colonel Kaithen Faris. They form the core of Faris‚Äô powerbase within the country. Although loyal to Kaithen, he can lose their support, which would be a catastrophic scenario. They are represented in-game by the character of **Lieutenant Jabel Musafa**, Kaithen‚Äôs second-in-command and close friend.

**The Serenica Narebi**

This is Kaithen‚Äôs ‚ÄòTribe.‚Äô Serenica is the home region of Kaithen Faris, and the Narebi community in Serenica forms a core part of Kaithen‚Äôs support beyond the military and the government and is therefore very useful to Kaithen. They are very loyal to Kaithen and his brother, Saif, although they have their own political needs and wants. They are represented by the character of **Saif Faris**, Kaithen‚Äôs brother.

# The Junta

The Committee for National Salvation, more commonly referred to as **The Junta**, is the ruling body directing Nibiya while it remains under military rule. They are roughly equivalent to the Presidential Cabinet in Sordland and the Royal Council in Rizia, although power is distributed far more evenly. While **Colonel Kaithan Faris** officially holds the position of President, his ability to act depends on the consent of at least 50% of the council (preferably 100%). At various points in the game, members of The Junta can either be convinced to step down or removed by force. The five members of The Junta are:

**Colonel Kaithen Faris ‚Äì President**

The player character. Kaithen‚Äôs role in organizing the coup and recruiting the others has led to his appointment as President. Despite holding the title, it is understood that the committee strives to make unanimous decisions whenever possible.

**General Zainan Salah ‚Äì Secretary for the Interior**

**General Salah** is the only woman in The Junta and the sole member of the Doumon Mossamist ethnic-religious community. The Mossamist faith has a tradition of allowing women to serve in leadership roles, but this doesn‚Äôt mean women in the Nibiyan military are free from resentment by combat troops. She comes from the eastern border region and previously commanded the Military Police Units of the Nibiyan army, which made her a natural choice for overseeing the Ministry for the Interior.

General Salah is the most ideological member of the Committee, firmly believing in the possibility of a multi-ethnic, functional Nibiyan democracy. The failure of the previous NMFN government to achieve this motivated her to join the coup. She is also highly concerned with the security of the neighboring unstable nation of **West Doughuk** and is committed to protecting the Doumon people living there. While not an open communist, she views **United Cortana** more favorably than others.  
During the Rikan Emergency, she executed an order to kill dozens of arrested military personnel suspected of disloyalty, a secret she is desperate to keep hidden.

**Lieutenant-Colonel Mansour Faiz Vogel ‚Äì Secretary for the Exterior**

**Colonel Vogel** is arrogant, egotistical, and often displays narcissistic tendencies. However, he is also highly charismatic and dangerously charming. Kaithen likely recruited Vogel into the coup out of necessity, relying on his tank battalion to secure the capital, Jamir. Vogel demanded the position of Secretary for the Exterior or Interior in exchange for his support.

Born in Jamir to a Narebi family with Valgish ancestry, Vogel leveraged his heritage to rise higher in the colonial military than most Nibiyans. He dreams of establishing a strong, militaristic state (with himself in charge) that asserts itself as a regional power. Vogel has no ideological loyalty to either the **CSP** or **ATO**, except where their support advances his aims. He is openly angling to take over The Junta and establish himself as a strongman dictator.

Vogel is maintaining affairs with the wives of **Ikraam Abdel** and **Tajiri Mwanga**, creating significant tension. He and General Salah openly despise one another. Vogel is an antagonistic force in the story and one of the most challenging members to remove.

**General Ikraam Abdel ‚Äì Secretary for Finance**

**General Ikraam Abdel** is both the oldest member of the committee and by-far the most well-respected, having a long and well-regarded history of service that begins in the Valgish colonial troops, then the South Zaer Republic Army and later the Nibiyan army. He is respected by all communities, even the Valgish community, after, during the Rikan Emergency, he defused a situation that would have otherwise turned into a bloodbath between indigenous workers and Valgish settlers. He was previously made head of the Armed Forces by the NMFN government but was later removed from this position. He joined the coup after learning about planned budget cuts to the military and Kaithen can suggest in dialogue that he wanted Abdel to be president instead of him but only took on the role due to Vogel‚Äôs objections. Due to the belief that Abdel was extremely trustworthy and non-corruptible, he was put in charge of the country‚Äôs treasury following the coup. Abdel is a devoutly Nurist Narebi from the north of Nibiya. He previously led the 1^(st) Nibiyan Army, which was responsible for security in the country‚Äôs interior.

Abdel broadly agrees with General Salah‚Äôs vision for a democratic Nibiya although he disagrees on how soon the population will be ‚Äúready for democracy‚Äù. Having spent his early careers having to argue for the needs of Nibiyan troops to his Valgish superiors, he also cares strongly about the wellbeing of the military and will often put the needs of the military before the needs of the country at large.

Despite his respect and military expertise, it becomes apparent over the course of the game that Abdel is actual extremely incompetent at statecraft and struggles to manage the national treasury.

**Colonel Tajiri Mwanga ‚Äì Secretary for Development**

**Colonel Mwanga** is a Zhanga from Yolal and a former classmate of Kaithen during their officer training in the South Zaer military. Depending on the player‚Äôs choices in the prologue, Mwanga and Kaithen may be close friends. Mwanga commands the Nibiyan Airborne Brigade and joined the coup after feeling overlooked for promotions under the NMFM government.

Mwanga lacks strong ideological convictions, often siding with Vogel. Secretly, he is highly corrupt and uses his position to enrich himself and his family.

# Paths and Endings

As in Sordland and Rizia, there are three main storylines the player can pursue, each representing a different theory of authority: **Rational-Legal Authority**, **Traditional Authority**, and **Charismatic Authority**, along with several possible failed endings. At the end of Act 2, Kaithen attempts to transform Nibiya‚Äôs government. Success depends on his actions and legitimacy, with failure often leading to civil war. The game ends shortly before 1953.

**The Rational-Legal Route**

This route see‚Äôs Kaithen work to establish a modern nation-state that will last beyond the rule of the military junta. Although nominally a parliamentary democracy, Kaithen can choose just how democratic he wants Nibiya to be. Kaithen must identify and work with various actors to establish modern courts and a functioning bureaucracy as well as set-up trusted political parties that will respect democratic outcomes. He must also work to convince or coerce the other members of the military Junta into stepping down, in favour of the new government. Kaithen can choose whether to align with either the ATO, CSP or remain neutral.

At the end of the 2^(nd) Act, a parliamentary election will be held (Kaithen will still President at this time however). If Kaithen has been successful, the results of the parliamentary election will be accepted by the country and Kaithen can then continue to work with the victors to pass further reforms in the final act. At the very end of the game, he can choose to run as an elected president or step down. However If Kaithen fails to build trust and legitimacy into his new system, the resulting of the parliamentary elections will not be respected and the factions and characters that feel they are losing out will rebel against the new government, triggering a civil war. Even if Kaithen wins the civil war, he must remain as an unelected president overseeing the new government.

**The Traditionalist Route**

This storyline see‚Äôs Kaithen essentially synthesize a new political ideology which puts Nibiyan traditions front and centre. In this story Kaithen seeks to empower the Tribal Elite as much as possible while trying to return to the country‚Äôs agrarian past as a way of reversing the trauma of colonialism. He can choose whether to make the country a ‚Äúequable and plurinational‚Äù where each indigenous ethnic group has similar powers or he can try and make it dominated by the Narebi (his ethnic group) and their traditions. A successful Traditionalist run would see him work to peacefully overcome the various feuds and disputes between various tribal and religious communities. If he‚Äôs unsuccessful, the various ethnic/religious groups will go to war with one another and if Kaithen wins the civil war, its suggested the scars of ethnic division will never heal. This run can end with the country under the control of a ‚ÄúHigh Council of Elders‚Äù or with Kaithen appointing himself as the new King of Nibiya.

This route brings Kaithen into conflict with both the other members of The Junta and the Old Colony, although the Liberators can eventually be brought round. This run prevents Kaithen from being able to align with either of the superpowers (although he can choose market his new ideology as ‚ÄúRikan Socialism‚Äù) but there is a suggestion in the epilogue that he can choose closer relations with the emerging Intermerkopan, depending on choices made in the Rizia DLC.

**The Charismatic Route**

This run see‚Äôs Kaithan aim to remove the other members of The Junta, overcome the various factions, and become a strongman dictator. There are many options as to how and to what extent Kaithan achieves this. Towards the end of the second act, Kaithan will attempt some kind of second coup or purge of The Junta and other factions. If he‚Äôs successful, he will bring the country under his sole authority but if unsuccessful the surviving factions and junta members will rise up against him, triggering a civil war. During this run he can align himself with either superpower or remain neutral.

# Foreign Relations

The three non-superpower foreign nations that will play a prominent role in the story are Democratic Zanza, West Dorghuk, and Zaerland.

**Democratic Zanza**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Zhangha (majority), Narebi (Minority)  
**Religion:** Rikan Nurity, Animism, Presidential Cult of Personality  
**Industries:** Cocoa, Subsistence Farming, Gas  
**Alignment:** CSP  
**Military Power:** Equal to Nibiya  
**Economy:** Poorer than Nibiya

Democratic Zanza was previously a Lespian colony called Cabo Zanza. However, the indigenous population rose, leading to a bloody rebellion roughly analogous to the Portuguese colonial wars ‚Äì this started the Rikan Emergency. The rebels were backed by the CSP and embraced a communist ideology. After securing their independence, the country gradually became a dictatorship with a cult of personality around its dictator, **Musa Nyundo**. Nyundo is charismatic but unstable and implied to be growing increasingly mentally ill. There are a number of rebellions against his rule, and over the course of the game, it becomes apparent he is conducting a Pol Pot-style purge of anyone he deems to be a threat.

Democratic Zanza‚Äôs foreign policy is erratic and unpredictable. The country‚Äôs main concern is the ATO-aligned Marabone to its east. Nyundo will start off as friendly towards Nibya but will quickly feel threatened if Kaithen is too successful pushing for reforms or consolidating his own power. Should relations turn unfriendly, Nyundo may start to threaten the Narebi ethnic minority in Democratic Zanza or start claiming that the Zhanga minority in Nibya need liberating. Initially aligned with the CSP, Maina might suddenly switch to being neutral if Nibiya starts to align with the CSP. In general, Maina wants Nibiya to act as a bulwark against the ATO.

Towards the middle of the game, Nyundo (if he remains on good terms with Kaithen) may request military support against the growing insurgency in Democratic Zanza. Doing this makes Nibiya complicit in Maina‚Äôs war crimes but provides options later in the game to support regime change in Democratic Zanza, turning the country into a puppet of Nibiya. Otherwise, Democratic Zanza‚Äôs fate is dependent on how Nibiya is aligned at the end of the game. If Nibiya is aligned with the ATO, the CSP step up their support for Nyundo‚Äôs regime, allowing him to cling to power. If Nibiya is aligned with the CSP, the CSP indicate they would support a Nibiyan invasion into Democratic Zanza. If Nibiya is neutral, mercenaries from Marabone invade and, in the epilogue, Nibiya has the option to intervene against them, turning the war into a proxy war.

**Zaerland**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Zhangha (majority), Valgish-Rikans (ruling minority)  
**Religion:** Nurity  
**Exports:** Ivory, gold, coffee, tobacco  
**Alignment:** ATO  
**Military Power:** Greater than Nibiya  
**Economy:** Richer than Nibiya

Zaerland is very much the Apartheid South Africa of Rika. Established in the early 18th century, the territory of Valgish Rika was split between the colonies of North Zaerland and South Zaerland in 1732. The Northern Colony received a much greater portion of Valgish settlers than the South, and thus was favored for investment and development by the Valgish empire. Both colonies declared independence following the Valgish revolution; however, their paths diverged during the Rikan Emergency when the North Zaer Armed Forces (which were predominantly Valgish, compared to the SZAF) effectively suppressed the uprising. After South Zaerland became Nibiya, North Zaerland became referred to as just Zaerland. Zaerland subsequently agreed in principle to the Rika Independence Process, although has made considerably slow progress on actually transitioning the country to majority rule.

Officially the country is a parliamentary democracy; however, in practice, its complex tricameral legislature serves to retain the power of the Valgish-Rikan elite. A common refrain from Zaer politicians is that ‚ÄúReform is Coming,‚Äù yet Valgish-Rikans remain politically and economically dominant over the indigenous Rikans. The Zaer police are known for their brutality. Presently Zaerland is led by **Rudolph Von Heertz** of the Zaer National Party. The country is the richest in Rika, although there is a huge wealth divide, and also has the most powerful military on the continent.

Zaerland desires closer relations with the ATO, who see them as a potential partner in such a CSP-dominated region; however, Arcasia is concerned over the public backlash from being too closely aligned with the internationally unpopular state. Zaerland‚Äôs chief foreign policy concern is the welfare of the Valgish-Rikans in Nibiya. If they feel the Valgish-Rikans are being mistreated, they will step up military support for a mercenary intervention in Nibiya. Most other Rikan nations (along with Valgsland and Galmland) are hostile to Zaerland, so the Zaer government is willing to work with Nibiya on trade and security. Being too close with Zaerland may result in a backlash from a large segment of the Nibiyan population, however.

Depending on Kaithen‚Äôs actions in the game, he may be able to put enough pressure on the Von Heertz government to finally take reform seriously, especially if Nibiya becomes aligned with the ATO. (If Nibiya becomes aligned with the CSP, it‚Äôs hinted in the epilogue that Zaerland is pursuing its own nuclear weapons program.) Nibiya can also attempt to arm rebels in Zaerland, although this will only result in Zaerland becoming more hostile and authoritarian. If relations with Zaerland are good and Nibiya enters a civil war, Zaerland will offer military support (although this will trigger a backlash from the Liberators faction). If relations with Zaerland are poor, however, they will send armed units into Nibiya to secure their border.

**West Dorghuk**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Doumon, numerous other ethnic groups  
**Religion:** Mossamism, others  
**Exports:** Oil, uranium, gas, rare minerals  
**Alignment:** none  
**Military Power:** Numerous rebel groups  
**Economy:** very low

West Dorghuk is a collapsed failed state on the border of Nibiya. Formerly part of the Arcasian client state of the Kingdom of the Dorghuk, following the king‚Äôs overthrow during the Rikan Emergency, the country split into East and West Dorghuk. West Dorghuk fell into civil war immediately between various factions and ethnic groups. Predominantly desert, the country is rich in resources, especially energy resources, and the recent discovery of uranium has attracted the attention of the superpowers. Nearly every neighboring nation is also interfering in some way in the civil war in West Dorghuk while refugees flee the country. The conflict is beginning to take on sectarian dimensions due to a growing rebel force of Fundamentalist Mossamists who are allegedly targeting Nurists in the country.

Kaithen can push for Nibiya to involve itself in the West Dorghuk Civil War, both sending financial aid and military units into the country. The latter presents opportunities to seize resources within the nation, although will likely result in international outcry. To successfully intervene, alliances will need to be forged with the various factions of the civil war and with other nations intervening. Nibiya can also send or facilitate humanitarian aid flowing into the country. Another major problem will be dealing with the mass of refugees coming out of the country.

**United Cortana**  
With many allies in the region (Galmsland, Democratic Zanza), the lingering cultural influence of Valgsland, and the general appeal of socialism in the region, United Cortana is the more influential superpower on the Rikan continent. Despite this, their presence isn‚Äôt entirely welcome by all, as many see them as little more than would-be colonizers trying to ‚Äúcivilize‚Äù Rika through socialism rather than imperialism. The UC are represented in the game by their boorish ambassador, **Yolotzin Eluney Ubirajara**, who frequently implies Nibiya and the rest of Rika owe the Cortanas a debt due to ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù their revolutions and assumes the country is already in the CSP‚Äôs sphere of influence. Early in the game, he will offer a deal demanding Nibiyan uranium and rubber in exchange for money and an offer to send Cortana doctors and administrators to teach skills to the Nibiyans. Should relations with the Nibiyan Junta fail, the UC would rather see a socialist government under the ‚ÄòLiberators‚Äô Faction. They can potentially send funds and arms to help start a socialist rebellion against the Junta government.

**Arcasia**  
Arcasia, a former colonizer of Rika, is slowly starting to gain a foothold in the region, although it treads cautiously, despite the desires from colonial settler populations to ‚Äúliberate them from the indigenous Nurless Communists.‚Äù While openly pretending to remain distant on most Rikan affairs, the Arcasian Centre for Intelligence (ACI) has established a prominent network of agents and informers throughout the continent, hoping to sow chaos in United Cortana‚Äôs backyard. Arcasia‚Äôs only real ally at this point is Marabone, which is effectively a colony in all but name. If there is a Civil War in Nibiya, mercenaries from Marabone may aid or attack Kaithen‚Äôs forces, depending on his relationship with the superpower. If Kaithen becomes too close to the CSP, it‚Äôs suggested that Arcasia are plotting to allow the Old Colony to retake power in Nibiya.

In the game, Arcasia is represented by **Aur√©lia Bouvier**, a journalist of Geopolitico stationed in Jamir and secretly an ACI agent. Under the guise of an interview, she will approach Kaithen and offer to act as a backchannel between him and the Arcasians. During the game, Arcasia will offer to help develop Nibiya‚Äôs industries (especially its uranium industry) in exchange for partial ownership. They may sweeten the deal with personal bribes to Kaithen and offer useful intelligence to him.

**Other Nations**  
**Imaland** is a strongman dictatorship with theocratic elements, as the country is ruled under Mossamist law. They are heavily involved in backing Mossamist insurgents in West Dorghuk. Zaerland may want to cooperate with Nibiya in fighting their insurgent forces there.

**East Dorghuk** is the communist nation that emerged from the collapse of the Kingdom of Dorghuk. It claims rightful ownership of West Dorghuk, but its attempts to occupy the country have faced opposition from the West Dorghuk radical Mossamists.

**Zhao** is an unusual nation, being the only Zaranist nation of Rika, whose people descend from Qinal. A small Zhao minority resides in West Dorghuk, who desire to secede and join Zhao. Zhao, inevitably, is backing this militant group. Zhao is an authoritarian republic with a planned economy.

**Marabone** is essentially a neo-colony of Arcasia. Although in principle a parliamentary republic, it is in reality controlled by a small number of Arcasian businesses. Arcasian PMCs operate in Marabone and frequently cross the border into West Dorghuk.

# Economy

Nibiya‚Äôs current economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture with strong contributions from rubber, fishing, and the textiles industry. Large uranium deposits have been found in the east near the border with West Dorghuk.

The majority of Nibiyans work in subsistence agriculture. This generates little income for the country; however, attempting to shift too much of the population away from subsistence agriculture may lead to famine. Rural agricultural villages also form the bedrock of Nibiya, and especially Narebi, society and culture, and upsetting this dynamic may have severe consequences.

The Gulf of Rika is home to vast schools of fish, which are primarily farmed by small artisan fishing crews. Recently, they have been forced to compete against large fishing companies from Lespia and Arcasia. Closer relations with a superpower could help reduce the pressure on Nibiyan farmers. Continued competition may result in Nibiyan farmers resorting to‚Ä¶ other means‚Ä¶ to make money.

Despite rubber being the country‚Äôs ‚Äúcash crop,‚Äù it remains a point of shame due to the harsh exploitative conditions workers in the industry face, which were established during colonial rule. The rubber industry is still largely owned by a few Valgish-Rikan companies. While many Nibiyans want reform of both working conditions and management, the loss of the expertise of the companies could severely harm the industry‚Äôs profitability.

The growing number of textile factories around Nibiya‚Äôs major cities presents an interesting opportunity for the nation as more developed countries seek to outsource production to countries with cheap labour. But can Nibiya balance the need for development with preventing the further exploitation of its labourers?

Huge deposits of uranium have been found near the border with West Dorghuk. This untapped resource could both provide Nibiya with a newfound source of income and be the key to its energy independence. But choosing to exploit such a sought-after commodity will inevitably attract the attention of the world‚Äôs superpowers‚Ä¶

# Social/Cultural Issues

Nibiya faces three main societal challenges that Kaithen must face: rural forms of justice vs. establishing a proper policing and judicial system, balancing development and political power among Nibiya‚Äôs various ethnic and religious groups, and reconciliation with the atrocities of colonialism.

# Personal Life

Unlike Anton Rayne and Romus Toras, Kaithen Faris does not have a wife or children of his own (it could even be hinted that Kaithen is asexual). He faces familial pressure from his siblings and extended family, chiefly represented by his older brother, **Saif Faris**, who is effectively the ‚Äúchief‚Äù of their ‚Äútribe,‚Äù the Serenica Narebi. Saif wants to use his brother‚Äôs power to advance the position of their people, while often failing to appreciate the more nuanced view his brother has to consider.

Kaithen Faris also has to consider the needs of his own personal brigade of soldiers, the Nibiyan Light Infantry, who are represented by Kaithen‚Äôs second-in-command, **Lieutenant Jabel Musafa**. Although loyal to him, they too may not fully appreciate the complexities of politics and prefer more straightforward solutions to the country‚Äôs problems.

Come sit for a warm cup and a chat,"Good morning everybody, up early for some unknown reason on this Saturday. On days like this, that first cup of coffee is extra important. I'm enjoying it looking out at the snow, trying to will it to melt. I'm pretty much done with winter at this point and wouldn't mind spring showing up early, come on groundhog, do your job, LOL.

What's got you up early today, or what's keeping you up late? We can chat about all sorts of stuff, I don't mind just a 'Hi', it's a good starting point. Small talk, and deeper conversation is also welcome. love to talk about local lore and legends from all over, I think it's a pretty fun topic to discuss and gives a little insight into the people who live in that area.

# Personal Experience with Critical T

Tom, one of the friendliest guys in our office complex, is the type of person who‚Äôs always up for a chat at the coffee machine. Recently, he‚Äôd been feeling drained and less energetic, so when I [mentioned Critical T](https://theworldhealth.org/critical-t-official) during one of our conversations, he decided to give it a shot.

After about two weeks, Tom couldn‚Äôt stop raving about how much better he felt.

He said he was waking up refreshed, his usual midday energy crashes were a thing of the past, and even his focus during work had improved. ‚ÄúI feel sharper, like my old self,‚Äù he told me with a grin.

However, he did mention one small gripe‚Äîhe‚Äôs not a fan of taking capsules, and the faint herbal taste wasn‚Äôt exactly his favorite.

Still, he joked, ‚ÄúIf this is the price for having my energy back, I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù Tom‚Äôs verdict? Worth every penny for how much it‚Äôs helped him feel more alive and motivated.

Hearing his experience made it clear that Critical T isn‚Äôt just another supplement; it‚Äôs genuinely helping people regain control over their day-to-day energy and confidence. Thanks, Tom, for sharing your honest take!

I've been looking through the sub and found that it looks like my grind is too fine. It's bought pre ground from a local roaster but I then realised the problems started when I started this new coffee. So basically any recommendations for a non pressurised baskets that fits? I don't want to waste the coffee which is really nice. Especially since I have a few more bags in the same grind.

1i9l6xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1i9l6xr/dont_forget_your_bedroll/,Don't forget your bedroll!,"So here's my latest tragedy! I think I'll be ok....



Have been struggling through starvation and hurts on my gunloper run. I discovered that the wolves on Mystery Lake were trying to singlehandedly depopulate the local ptarmigans, having found them chewing on four birds within about three hours of one another - more for me! Despite this and some good handfuls of ptarmigan down, I was hungry and determined to build back my strength so I could head to TWM and AC for the backpack. I loaded up my travois, strapped on my pistol and bow with last of two arrows and headed off. 



Man, I forget just how big these maps are to get anywhere! If there's a straightforward way to get from Quonset to the PV transition mine, or from the mine to PV crash/bunker, I don't know it! I just took the main roads and tried to avoid wolves and bears (and managed to do so!)



I arrive at TWM and spend a day or two setting up fishing, making teas and storing gear I wasn't going to use (like woodworking tools I'd brought with to fix up the cabin). using the travois to avoid smells is my latest trick and I swear you do move faster using the travois than when you're walking encumbered. I thought to myself, there's still sun out - I'll check the Wing lockers and be back in time for bed. Wrong! I'm halfway there and I hear the cougar, which to date I'd only heard but not seen and this despite a) thinking I'd had cougars turned off on accident and b) only being in TWM for a day or two! I had a pack of timbies guarding the locker, a bear off somewhere to the left, and the cougar on my right up the hill, near where the deer carcass sometimes spawns.



Stupidly, I forged ahead. I aught to have just gone back to the cabin, but no. I managed to spot the cougar and he was a good way off, and I thought I was moving away. The wolves were temporarily spooked so I ran in to start a fire by the crates. I managed to hit one wolf and kill another before the pack could rally, but then the cougar charged! I had my pistol out and hit him at the last moment, he slashed me but only knocked the pistol from my grasp. I got the fire lit and tended my wounds. 



Unfortunately, night was setting fast. I took herbal tea, coffee and peaches from the lockers, putting on some wolf and water to cook. So distracted by the cougar sounds and my rush to dissect the carcass when night fell and it was a black one! I had my travois loaded with gear, meat, hide and guts, and the cougar blocking my way back to the cabin. I dared not go to the bear cave lest it be occupied, but Forest cave sounded good. I abandoned my travois so I could carry a torch and headed off into the darkness with swirling snow and cougar snarls.



So I find my way fine, it wasn't far and I didn't get charged - how grateful that I checked my status to see the infection risk I could cure with some lichen - I'd have surely died if I had laid down to rest, and intended to do just that... when I realised I'd left my bedroll in my travois.



Le sigh. I guess I'll grab a torch from the 6 hour fire I just built and follow my footsteps back to the lockers for my bedroll and anything else important I thought I could do without overnight. Wish me luck!

I need some help. I‚Äôm a UK citizen and just moved to Slough from Reading with my husband. 

We moved to our new place on 23/01/25, even though the tenancy started at 21/01/25 (we didn‚Äôt get the keys until the 22nd). When we went for a viewing the agent said everything would be cleaned up in time for us to move in. The previous tenants were here for 4 years so they said there would be wear and tear and they‚Äôll fix it (and we bluddy believed them!) before our move. 

Now come the day of the move. The property had literally furniture in it (bed, sofa, dining table and chairs, coffee table, tv stand unit, bedside tables) even though we were told this was unfurnished. Unfortunately on the day of the viewing the property hadn‚Äôt even been advertised so we just went to see this on a whim because our contract at our place in Reading was going to finish on 25th. They definitely told us it was going to be completely empty. 

Here are the following issues: 
1. We move in and the walls haven‚Äôt been painted. I‚Äôm pretty sure new tenants usually get painted walls? The walls have all these flies and bugs on them and we can literally see eggs, even though they told us that the place was cleaned professionally 
2. The carpet is disgusting and they said they‚Äôre going to replace the carpet but that isn‚Äôt until Monday so we haven‚Äôt had a chance to unpack or sort anything because everything will need to be moved room to room. 
3. The oven isn‚Äôt working. 
4. The cooker vent needs to be replaced, it‚Äôs all fallen apart. 
5. The dishwasher isn‚Äôt working due to water damage. 
6. Mold on the kitchen tiles on the silicon seals 
7. There‚Äôs literally shelves missing in the fridge 
8. Washing machine is working, but the door is broken 
9. Bathroom tiles are broken so they told us to avoid stepping on these until someone gets it fixed 
10. Previous tenants told us the gas would be included in the rent (but we were told something different) 

Due to point 1 & 2 there is an odour in the house and we don‚Äôt know what to do about it at the moment.

My question is what can be done, how can we request a rent adjustment, would that be possible? Is it too early to speak to the property ombudsman? The agent is shit and has crap reviews but we didn‚Äôt realise the place was going to be that bad when we moved in.

I consider getting myself a home/sample roaster (like Nano 7e). I‚Äôm just a coffee enthusiast from Norway mainly interested in filter roasts. I‚Äôm the only coffee consumer in the household and 1kg of beans per month is more than enough for me. So with that in mind, I would like to understand the consequences and practicality of getting a roaster for my needs before any commitment and would appreciate this respected community to evaluate my considerations and questions.

My thoughts are:
  - no matter what, I will, most probably, not have access to the really good beans like established roasters for reasonable price (I will still be able to buy 250g bags of green beans for nearly the same price as already roasted ones). Hence my roasts won‚Äôt match those I get from the established roasters
  - getting so small batches of green beans in Norway will be a challenge on its own, I assume
  - to be able to get anything decent, I will have to buy around 5-10kg a time.
  - considering so much beans I would have to consume, the variety of coffee I will be able to brew seems quite limited (yes, I can brew with different profiles, but the raw beans are still going to be the same for several months).

In this regard I have a couple of questions to this respected community:

  * How do you store the green beans at home?
  * How do you deal with lack of variety in your brews? Do different profiles adequately cover that or do you buy more different raw beans?
  * Considering my low consumption if the beans, do you think it‚Äôs still practical to get a roaster or I should accept that it‚Äôs just a very expensive and fun toy?",1,1737804635.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Then I changed my school, and the first day was traumatic. A girl asked me to smell whitener, and I didn‚Äôt know it was like a drug. Then she accidentally spilled it all over my pants. Somehow, I adjusted to this stupid school, and things were normal till grade 7.

Then lockdown came, and I stopped studying and got addicted to gaming. I got so bad at studies that I couldn‚Äôt solve basic linear equations in grade 9. I scored about 65% in grade 9, and during a PTM, my class teacher shouted at me and my parents, saying I was wasting their hard-earned money. That day, for the first time, I saw my mom cry.

In grade 10, I was placed in the best section because of the integrated coaching system, full of toppers with whom it felt hard to cope up with. My so-called best friend, who was super smart, blackmailed me, saying he‚Äôd tell others about my bad marks. I thought he wouldn‚Äôt, but he did, and they all laughed at me. That whole year, I was bullied by both teachers and students. My chemistry teacher always targeted me, and during a history exam, I was caught with chits and given a new answer sheet. But later, the examiner put those chits in my answer copy, which was shown to my strict class teacher.

These two years were hell, but grade 10 ended with a 97% score, a huge academic comeback for me. It was the first time I felt happy in years.

I had a dog who helped me survive those tough times. Then comes grade 11th, I made new friends like really good friends. Days passed I became social, I was no more an introvert.

By the end of grade 11, I started liking a girl in my class‚Äîthe topper with the prettiest face and sweetest voice. We became good friends, and I even asked her out for coffee, to which she said yes but exams got in the way. She sent me pictures, asking, ‚ÄúKaisi lag rahi hoon?‚Äù and that made me blush all day. But as exams neared, we stopped talking.

I thought I‚Äôd confess after JEE, but understanding a girl‚Äôs feelings can be so confusing. It started to feel like she wasn‚Äôt interested in talking to me anymore. Slowly, I‚Äôve started losing interest in her. On top of that, I lost my dog two months ago, he ran away and was nowhere to be found. That broke me completely.

I gave JEE Main two days ago, and it went well. This is my life story. I needed to rant here, because I have no one to share all this with.",5,1737804176.0,IndianTeenagers,3,1.0,False

anxiety (psyche hoped that my anxiety was a result of undiagnosed adhd and that meds would help a lot)

restlessness (always pacing around and fidgeting)

focus and attention issues (like forgetting what i'd just read or heard. Putting coffee in a cup when i'm supposed to be makig myself a tea!)

methylp made my anxiety worse. Also seems to take away my charisma personality. Hard for me to laugh as felt very serious. Robotic. Distracted by the meds? felt a bit edgy and jittery

they say they typically don't let you try more than one med unless the sides are basically dangerous and that they only have a 12 week window but I managed to convince them to let me try elvanse

Elvanse was /is basically the same as methylp for me. The added anxiety doesn't seem quite as bad (but certainly no better than baseline). Restlessness isn't improved.

And with focus and attention, I just find it so hard to 'measure'. I'm not sure if either drug has helped with that or not

As far as I know there's only staterra and dex left?

I imagine dex will be the same as the other 2 since maybe that's how my body reacts to stimulants? (and that's assuming they're open to let me try yet another med)

I'm curious what the course of action will be. I'm not sure they're gonna let me try another med tbh (as I say, it wasn't easy to let me try a 2nd one!). And we are also running out of time. 

Do I get 'released' with no meds if nothing seems to help?
Do they 'extend' the titration period?
Do they just say 'well, elvanse is at least helping your binge eating so we'll stick with that. Good bye', kind of thing??

1i9kjkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1i9kjkz/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts ‚Äì just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let‚Äôs clear up a misconception: introversion doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren‚Äôt overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished ‚Äì unable to pass on their genes.) That‚Äôs one of the factors why we‚Äôre here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you‚Äôre definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don‚Äôt have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It‚Äôs a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You‚Äôre an Introvert with Anxiety‚Äîwhich ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control‚Äîbut it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‚Äò‚Äôbest case scenario‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì luck isn‚Äôt a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn‚Äôt stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active‚Äîsometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won‚Äôt be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‚ÄòFrom Limitations to Liberation‚Äô ‚Äì it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it‚Äôs a high energy ‚Äòstate‚Äô ‚Äì one of the reasons it can be so tiring)‚Äîconstantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‚Äòwhat is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?‚Äô


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets ‚Äì sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new caf√©. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‚Äòprogrammed‚Äô by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‚Äòprogramming‚Äô new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You‚Äôve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it‚Äôs just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options ‚Äì see my article ‚ÄòLive the life you choose ‚Äì expand your Thought-Action Repertoire‚Äô), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you‚Äôre anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event‚Äîlike having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like ‚ÄúI need everyone to like me to be valuable‚Äù create intense anxiety around how you‚Äôre perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‚Äòthem‚Äô?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you‚Äôre not responsible for everyone else‚Äôs happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it‚Äôs not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it‚Äôs time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‚Äòlights out‚Äô time ‚Äì read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it‚Äôs also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You‚Äôre not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself‚Äîthere‚Äôs strength in softness.

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it‚Äôs 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you‚Äîit‚Äôs a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn‚Äôt mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don‚Äôt even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed‚Äîthis could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen‚Äîthis not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

Chapter 10 : The Phantom Puppeteer's identity revealed 

In Andy Moneroes' office, Bobby Winters and Megan Jensen start rummaging. 

Megan pulls the white mask of the Phantom Puppeteer out of a dresser. 

- Look, Bobby, that's the mask the Phantom Puppeteer wore in that locked warehouse... there should be no doubt now, Andy Moneroes is the Phantom Puppeteer said  Megan . 

Bobby shows Megan a picture of Abigail Jensen and Andy Moneroes, next to each other. Abigail's hair color has changed in this picture, she is  redhead in it. 

- And look at this picture I found of Abigail Jensen and Andy Moneroes in the other dresser, after she faked her death, Jason Willis aka Jason Woosborrow who she knew well probably introduced her to Andy Moneroes said  Bobby 

- That could be it, her involvement in this case, Abigail could have become Andy Moneroes' accomplice said Megan Jensen. 

Meanwhile at the morgue, Lieutenant Hank O'Reilly speaks with the medical examiner, the corpse of what appears to be Jane Rand is on an operating table.

- If I came, it's to find out exactly what Jane Rand died of, she was the girlfriend of one of my colleagues and I would like to help her said Hank O'Reilly.

- I'm still not sure exactly what she died of said  the medical examiner . 

Meanwhile, at Jane Rand's house, James Leblanc returns to find clues to solve the case, he talks with Jane Rand's butler, Christopher:

- The house of my employer, the late Jane Rand, once belonged to her great grandmother Abigail Rand, which makes this house over 60 years old. Be careful not to break anything when doing your investigation here, many things are a bit dated and fragile here, said Christopher.

- Abigail Rand, you said  says James having listened carefully to what he said.

- Yes, that's why my employer is Jane Abigail Rand, her middle name comes from her said  Christopher .

- That's funny because she told me her middle name Abigail comes from her aunt Abigail Jensen, you must be mistaken said James. 

James Leblanc, drinking his cup of coffee, suddenly sees a photo of film director Edgar Williams and Jane Rand, next to each other on some grass on a shelf and he starts to say: 

- I recognize the guy in this picture, it's the director Edgard Williams, he became the new director of the movie ""The Massacres of the city of sins"" before it was canceled. He was killed by the actor Elliott Wilkinson. Later Elliott Wilkinson was even shot by Robert Walker who was paid by the Phantom Puppeteer to kill him.

-Interesting detail, isn't it, the director Edgar Williams was Jane Rand's boyfriend for a few years before her death says Christopher.

After Christopher said that, James Leblanc understood something and dropped the coffee cup which crashed to the ground.

Later, outside, James Leblanc runs away from the house of his girlfriend whom he thought was dead, multiple flashbacks coming back to him: 

Him explaining the motivations Jane Rand might have had for ordering the murders of Alex Jensen and Anton Rivera which are obvious since one of them killed his father and the other killed his mother but he wasn't sure at the time.

Not only that, he remembers in his head what the butler Christopher just told him, Edgar Williams was Jane Rand's boyfriend, so she had a motivation to order Elliott Wilkinson's murder too since that was this guy,  the murderer of Edgar Williams . 

More flashbacks continue in his head...himself giving his phone number to Jane Rand after revealing to her that he was investigating to discover the identity of the Phantom Puppeteer. 

The Phantom Puppeteer first called him on his phone and told him that he sent this guy to kill him to stop the investigation he's conducting to discover his identity. 

Not only had the Phantom Puppeteer gained access to his phone number, this individual knew he was investigating to discover his identity.

All the clues are there, put together, he managed to deduce the identity of the Phantom Puppeteer but he doesn't want to believe it, he loved Jane Rand and her being the Phantom Puppeteer seems impossible unless....

James Leblanc hears his phone ring, takes his phone from one of his pockets and answers it and has a conversation on the phone with Lieutenant Hank O'Reilly:

- Hi James, I'm at the morgue, I spoke with the medical examiner to find out what Jane Rand died of said Hank O'Reilly. 

- Hank, I just understood something, I really don't think that's Jane Rand's corpse, you could check if an ultra realistic mask wasn't put on it, I told you about what happened with that corpse in Lake City, do you remember? James asks.

Lieutenant Hank O'Reilly places one of his hands on what appears to be the face of Jane Rand's corpse and removes the latex mask of Jane Rand that was placed on the corpse, revealing it to be the corpse of Lindsay Moneroes, Jane Rand's servant. 

- You're right, James, someone put a Jane Rand mask on that corpse, what does that mean? said Hank O'Reilly.

- That means what I didn't want to believe is true said  James , starting to hang up. 

Meanwhile, in an airport, in the toilets, after removing a Lindsay Moneroes mask, Jane Rand puts on an ultra realistic latex woman mask as well as a blonde wig, she leaves the toilets and walks into the airport.

Later, in his apartment, James Leblanc, Megan Jensen and Bobby Winters are talking together on the couch: 

- Jane Rand! So Andy Moneroes would be innocent ask  Megan. 

- He could still be her accomplice or share the nickname and disguise of the Phantom Puppeteer with Jane Rand but I'm not sure but all the clues put together lead me to deduce that it's her and I'm even more sure after what Lieutenant O'Reilly discovered said  James .

- But what would be Abigail Jensen's involvement in all this? Bobby said. 

- I don't know, I really don't know said James 

Later that night, on a plane, sitting on one of the seats, Jane Rand is still wearing the latex mask and blonde wig she put on.

An hour later, James Leblanc is interviewed by journalists while being filmed by a camera held by someone, his interview is broadcast on television: 

- I'm Inspector James Leblanc, the person we're looking for is Jane Rand, we have good reason to believe that she not only faked her death but that she is a criminal mastermind behind several murders calling herself the Phantom Puppeteer, We later analyzed the white mask that was worn by this mysterious criminal mastermind and Jane Rand's DNA was found on it. This young woman may have fled to another country at this time, so if you see a woman resembling the one in this photo, report it to the LAPD said James holding up a photo of Jane Rand. 

The next morning in his apartment, James Leblanc takes the letter given by a postman and closes the door. 

James Leblanc opens the letter and takes out the blank sheet of paper inside and begins to read what is written inside.

Here are the confessions written on this white sheet: 

Hello to you, my love, it's Jane Rand again writing to you what you're going to read in this letter, I watched television yesterday, I know what you said when you were interviewed on television. I can't deny it anymore, I'm the Phantom Puppeteer, I might as well confess everything to you since you understood so well. 

When I was 10 years old, after my father, the famous clown Jack Rand died without me knowing it at the time, I called my mother Katherine Rand, who became Katherine Jensen again, with the phone I could find to tell her that my father had disappeared for too many hours. 

She came to our house to check on me and days went by and my father still hadn't come home. I told my mother what my father had said about producer Jeffrey Lyphenstein and she confronted him about it in his studio because she suspected him of being involved in this disappearance. Jeffrey Lyphenstein suddenly threatened to harm me. My mother decided to protect me from him, she decided to have me adopted by my grandparents Bob Jensen and Margareth Jensen and to change my first and last name, they didn't even know I existed. My mother brought me to their house in Lake City, lying to them that I was an orphan and that my name was Abigail Sandfield inspired by my middle name, so Bob and Margareth Jensen adopted me without even knowing that they were my grandparents and they changed my first and last name believing that Abigail was my real name and I became Abigail Jensen.

Yes, I was Abigail, it was me, she was never my aunt contrary to what I claimed, what a surprise, isn't it. I lived with the Jensens for years with my hair dyed blonde, with my aunts thinking they were just my sisters. A few years later, after faking my death thanks to Jason Willis aka Jason Woosborrow, I became Jane Rand again and had a plastic surgery operation changing my face so I wouldn't be recognized. 

Later I asked my boyfriend director Edgar Williams to direct the movie ""The  Massacres of the city of sins"" so he could sabotage it because it was going to portray my late father horribly. I ordered Jason Willis aka Jason Woosborrow to get hired as a producer at Horrors Studios so he could get Edgar Williams hired as the new director of this movie to help accomplish this sabotage plan. After I saw Edgar Williams get killed by this Elliott Wilkinson on a security camera video in Horrors Studios, I cracked, I admit it,

I was still an imperfect person, my dear love, but I paid Robert Walker to kill Elliott Wilkinson, but I had a good reason for wanting him dead, a pretty acceptable reason.

Then deciding to  get nicknamed  the  Phantom Puppeteer referring to how I faked my death as Abigail Jensen, I later got my revenge on Alex Jensen and Anton Rivera by paying Robert Walker to make him  kill them. One had killed my father and one had killed my mother, I admit I really wanted you killed at first but I later fell in love with you, it was still easy to make it look like I was kidnapped by Jason in St. John's High School so you would come save me, don't you think. Order Jack Morrows to kill Bobby Winters in order to stop this attempted murder as Jane Rand, this was all part of a plan so Jack Morrows could reveal that he was hired by the Phantom Puppeteer so I could bring suspicion to my grandfather and adoptive father, Police Chief Bob Jensen because I knew what his motivation would have been for doing this. After you suspected me because I had obvious motives to order the murders of Alex Jensen and Anton Rivera, I had to remove suspicion from myself. It was also to make people believe that I was innocent that I faked my death and that I made people believe that the Phantom Puppeteer ordered that I be killed, I paid the hitman George Wilkinson to kill my servant Lindsay and to chase me while being filmed by the surveillance cameras in order to make my fake death more convincing, I put the clothes I was wearing that day on Lindsay Moneroes and I put a latex mask of my face accompanied by a red wig stuck on it on her face to make believe that it was my corpse then I killed George Wilkinson so that he would not reveal my identity. Then, I planted my white mask in Andy Moneroes' office at the marquee to have him accused. I miss you, my dear love, I assure you of that, what motivated me even more to convince you as well as Megan and Bobby to abandon this investigation and to fake my death a second time, is that I fell madly in love with you and that motivated me to not have you killed anymore, so that led me to find other solutions.

I am currently in another country with a new face of course thanks to another plastic surgery operation. I had my first and last name changed, if you see me again, you won't even know it's me. Imagine if I start faking my death a third time, so I will come back after my apparent death again... like a Phantom, goodbye, my love. 

Jane Rand aka Abigail Jensen aka the Phantom Puppeteer.

I didn‚Äôt really take any notice because she needs to take it up with area team but she won‚Äôt because she sucks up to them, I then do a night shift and close alone but I did have someone here from a different shop for a few hours but the sweets were left open on the counter so I‚Äôm not sure if they had some but once again not my issue she should have took them home, my manager asks me the next day what happened with the sweets, I said seriously?

With Dumping water out several times, I could with some effort get it to 92-93 degrees. **This kind of shocked me, because I did not expect this big drop in temperature.**

The usual knowledge for espresso would be that 93 degrees is optimal. But when using very dark supermarket roasts (judge me if you want, but  I cant afford specialty roasted coffee all the time, my consumption is to high for that) I actually really like the 85 -87 degree shots.  They are not sour at all, and very smooth, I actually go lower in temperature than that sometimes. When using medium roasts, I try to go a bit hotter but It is still nowhere near  93-96 degrees, but they still taste better then some espresso from a specialty shop where I paid 6 ‚Ç¨.

So maybe because of the longer brew time 35-45 sec, the temperature does not need to be that high? Has anyone maybe at Flair looked into this and what temperature is optimal?",2,1737801763.0,FlairEspresso,3,1.0,False

1i9k6sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9k6sp/library_of_demons/,Library of demons.,"They called it the Atramentum Library, though no maps marked its location. It existed as a whispered rumor among scholars and occultists‚Äîa place older than recorded history, where forbidden knowledge rested, waiting to be claimed.¬†¬†

For most of my life, it had been nothing more than a myth, a tantalizing story passed from one eager seeker to the next. But then the letter arrived.¬†¬†

It was written on brittle parchment, the ink dark and glossy, as though it had never dried. There were no pleasantries, no signature‚Äîonly a single line, written in precise, angular script:¬†¬†

‚ÄúCome to the Atramentum Library. You have been chosen.‚Äù

The letter contained no address, but I knew where to go. I couldn‚Äôt explain how. The knowledge was simply there in my mind, like a memory I hadn‚Äôt known I‚Äôd forgotten.¬†¬†

I left that same night, abandoning the warmth of my study for the cold, fog-drenched streets.¬†¬†

The library stood at the edge of a forest, its silhouette towering against the moonless sky. It wasn‚Äôt like any building I‚Äôd ever seen‚Äîits architecture was jagged, unnatural, as though it had been carved from a single block of black stone by a hand that did not care for symmetry or reason.¬†¬†

Its doors were enormous, carved with symbols I couldn‚Äôt read but felt deep in my gut‚Äîlike sharp claws raking across my mind.¬†¬†

As I stepped inside, the air grew cold and heavy, pressing against my skin like a damp shroud.¬†¬†

The library was vast. Endless.¬†¬†

The shelves stretched up into the darkness, higher than any cathedral‚Äôs ceiling. Books crammed every inch of space‚Äîsome ancient, their pages crumbling with age; others sleek and pristine, their spines glowing faintly as though they were alive. The smell of paper and ink mingled with something fouler: the metallic tang of blood, the acrid scent of burnt hair.¬†¬†

But it wasn‚Äôt silent.¬†¬†

Whispers drifted through the air, faint but constant, like a thousand voices murmuring in languages I couldn‚Äôt understand. I stopped in my tracks, my breath catching.¬†¬†

The whispers weren‚Äôt coming from the shadows. They were coming from the books.¬†¬†

The first book I touched burned me.¬†¬†

It was small, bound in what looked like cracked leather, its title unreadable. The moment my fingers brushed the cover, heat shot through me, searing my skin and sending a wave of nausea rolling through my stomach. I jerked my hand back, stumbling.¬†¬†

The book opened itself, its pages fluttering as though caught in an invisible wind. Words began to write themselves across the parchment, black ink spreading like blood through water:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou are not ready.‚Äù

The book slammed shut, the force of it knocking me backward.¬†¬†

I gasped, cradling my hand. The skin was unmarked, but it still throbbed as though burned.¬†¬†

That was when I noticed the shadows.¬†¬†

They moved between the shelves, not like people but like things crawling on too many limbs. They were slow, deliberate, and watching me.¬†¬†

I pressed forward, deeper into the library, drawn by something I couldn‚Äôt name.¬†¬†

The deeper I went, the stranger the books became.¬†¬†

One was bound in something that looked alarmingly like human skin, its surface tattooed with symbols that seemed to shift when I wasn‚Äôt looking. when I touch it again same thing happened I burn my fingure.

Some books didn‚Äôt even have covers. They writhed on the shelves like living things, their pages curling and uncurling, whispering secrets to one another in voices too quiet to hear.¬†¬†

But one book called to me.¬†¬†

It sat alone on a pedestal in the center of a circular room, its cover blacker than the shadows around it. As I approached, the whispers grew louder, forming words I could almost understand.¬†¬†

The title burned itself into my mind before I even opened it: The secret book of Atramentum.

I reached out, my hand trembling. The moment I touched the cover, the library changed.¬†¬†

The shelves groaned, their wood twisting and splintering. The whispers turned to screams, shrill and panicked, echoing through the endless halls. The shadows surged forward, slamming into me, and I realized too late that they weren‚Äôt shadows at all.¬†¬†

They were demons.¬†¬†

I don‚Äôt know how I survived.¬†¬†

One moment, the shadows were clawing at me, their hands tearing at my flesh, and the next, I was standing in a new room‚Äîvast, circular, and empty except for a single figure.¬†¬†

It sat on a throne of bone and books, its body cloaked in tattered robes that seemed to shift and ripple like smoke. Its face was hidden, but I could feel its eyes on me, burning holes into my soul.¬†¬†

It spoke without moving, its voice deep and echoing:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou seek knowledge, mortal. But knowledge has a price.‚Äù

I tried to speak, but my throat was dry, my voice stolen by fear.¬†¬†

The figure rose, towering over me, its form impossibly large. It gestured to the secret book in my hands.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou have chosen the book. Now the book chooses you.‚Äù¬†





The pages of the secret book began to turn, faster and faster, the air around me filling with the sound of tearing flesh and breaking bones. Words I couldn‚Äôt understand burned themselves into my skin, their heat searing me to the core.¬†¬†

I screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the library.¬†¬†


When I woke, the library was silent.¬†¬†

The book lay open beside me, its pages blank and still. My body ached, my hands trembling as I tried to push myself up. Every nerve in me screamed, as if I‚Äôd been hollowed out and left raw.¬†¬†

But something was wrong.¬†¬†

The whispers hadn‚Äôt stopped. They were louder now, clearer, and they weren‚Äôt coming from the books anymore.¬†¬†

They were coming from inside me.¬†¬†

I froze, my chest tightening as I realized the truth. The Keeper‚Äôs voice echoed in my mind, calm and cold:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou are the book now. A vessel for knowledge. A doorway to the abyss.‚Äù

I stumbled to my feet, the whispers pressing against my soul, desperate and endless. I could feel the weight of the library itself shifting around me, its walls groaning as the shadows closed in.¬†¬†

But I wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore.¬†¬†

Because something else had taken root inside me‚Äîsomething dark, something hungry.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt walk toward the door. I was pulled.¬†¬†

The entrance to the library was different now. Where before there had been massive, carved doors, there was now only an archway of jagged stone, framing an endless void.¬†¬†

And through that void, I could see the world outside.¬†¬†

I stepped forward, the air crackling around me, and the whispers inside my head rose to a deafening roar. My hands burned, and when I looked down, I saw words scrawling themselves across my skin‚Äîendless, twisting lines of ink that moved and shifted like living things.¬†¬†

The Keeper‚Äôs voice spoke again, soft and patient:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou will return to the world, but you will not leave this library. You carry it now. You are its herald, its seed. Wherever you go, the library will follow.‚Äù

I tried to resist, tried to fight it, but it was too late. The void pulled me in, and when I opened my eyes again, I was standing in my study room.

At first, I thought I had escaped.¬†¬†

The familiar comfort of my bookshelves and desk greeted me, the moonlight streaming through the window. Everything looked the same as I had left it.¬†¬†

But then I saw the shadows.¬†¬†

They writhed along the edges of the room, moving in and out of the bookshelves, stretching toward me like hungry fingers. The air smelled of old blood and burnt hair. And when I turned to the mirror on the wall, I didn‚Äôt see my own reflection.¬†¬†

I saw shelves.¬†¬†

Endless shelves, stretching into darkness, their books alive and breathing. I saw myself walking those aisles, bound in shadows, and I realized the truth.¬†¬†

The library wasn‚Äôt just following me.¬†¬†

It was inside me.¬†

I didn‚Äôt leave the house for weeks. The whispers never stopped, and every night, I found myself writing‚Äîpages and pages of words I didn‚Äôt understand, scrawled in ink that bled from my fingertips.¬†¬†

And then the letter came.¬†¬†

It was on the same brittle parchment, the ink dark and glossy, and it was written in that same angular script:¬†¬†

‚ÄúCome to the Atramentum Library. You have been chosen.‚Äù¬†¬†

But this time, the letter wasn‚Äôt addressed to me.¬†¬†

It was addressed to my neighbor.¬†¬†

I stood at my window, watching as she read it‚Äîa young woman in her twenties, her face lighting up with curiosity. She tucked the letter into her coat and glanced toward my house, her eyes meeting mine.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt wave. I couldn‚Äôt.¬†¬†

Because I knew what would happen next.¬†¬†

She would go. She would enter the library. And I would feel it growing stronger.¬†¬†

And when she came back, she would carry the same curse. The library wasn‚Äôt just a place‚Äîit was a hunger, spreading like a disease. And I was part of it now.¬†¬†

I am the first step. The invitation. The bait.¬†¬†

The library would always need new readers.¬†¬†

And I would always be there to welcome them.¬†¬†¬†

Days turned into weeks, and the library‚Äôs grip on me only grew stronger.¬†¬†

At first, the changes were small. Shadows lingered in the corners of my vision, even in broad daylight. I could hear the books whispering to me, their voices weaving through my thoughts like threads in a loom. Sleep became a distant memory. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw its aisles‚Äîendless, twisting, alive.¬†¬†

Then, the physical changes began.¬†¬†

The ink didn‚Äôt stay on my skin. It spread. Dark lines snaked up my arms and over my chest, forming symbols I couldn‚Äôt read but somehow understood. They burned when I touched them, a reminder of the knowledge now trapped inside me.¬†¬†

I couldn‚Äôt leave the house anymore. Not really. Every time I stepped outside, the world felt... thinner. Like the ground beneath me wasn‚Äôt real. Like I was walking on the surface of a dream, and the library was the reality waiting to swallow me whole.¬†¬†

I wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. I was a doorway.

The young woman returned three days later.¬†¬†

I heard her footsteps first, slow and hesitant, echoing through the empty street. She looked different now‚Äîher face pale, her eyes wide and glassy.¬†¬†

And the whispers. I could hear them coming from her too.¬†¬†

She knocked on my door, her hand trembling. I didn‚Äôt want to answer. I didn‚Äôt want to face what I had done. But my body wasn‚Äôt mine anymore.¬†¬†

I opened the door.¬†¬†

Her gaze snapped to mine, and for a moment, she didn‚Äôt speak. Then she stepped inside, her voice barely a whisper:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou knew, didn‚Äôt you? You knew what it would do to me.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúI...‚Äù My voice faltered. There were no words I could say to make her understand.¬†¬†

She raised her hands, and I saw the ink spreading across her skin, just like mine. ‚ÄúWhat happens to us now?‚Äù¬†¬†

I wanted to tell her the truth. That the library wasn‚Äôt finished with us. That we were its heralds, its servants. But before I could speak, she crumpled to the floor, her body writhing as the ink consumed her.¬†¬†

The library was claiming her.¬†

The next letter came a week later. Then another.¬†¬†

I watched from my window as they were delivered to homes across the city. I recognized the hunger in their eyes as they opened them, that same curiosity that had led me to my own ruin.¬†¬†

One by one, they disappeared. And one by one, they came back, changed.¬†¬†

The city itself began to feel different. Shadows stretched longer than they should, twisting across the ground like living things. The air grew heavier, colder, as though the library‚Äôs presence was leaking into the world.¬†¬†

And then there were the books.¬†¬†

They started appearing in places they didn‚Äôt belong‚Äîon park benches, in coffee shops, on subway seats. Each one carried the same whispers, the same promises of forbidden knowledge. And every time someone touched one, I felt the library‚Äôs power surge inside me, growing stronger.¬†¬†¬†

It wasn‚Äôt just the books or the people. The city itself was changing.¬†¬†

One night, I wandered the streets, trying to understand what was happening. I turned a corner and found myself standing in a place that shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîa street lined with shelves, stretching into the darkness. The books on those shelves glowed faintly, their titles written in a language I couldn‚Äôt read.¬†¬†

I stepped closer, my heart pounding, and a voice whispered from behind me:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre spreading it.‚Äù¬†¬†

I turned to see the young woman, her face now hollow and her eyes sunken. She smiled, though it was a joyless thing, her teeth sharp and stained with ink.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis is how it begins,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe library isn‚Äôt just a place anymore. It‚Äôs becoming... everything.‚Äù¬†¬†

The realization hit me like a blow.¬†¬†

The library wasn‚Äôt satisfied with taking people one by one. It was growing, consuming, expanding its reach. Soon, the whole city would become part of it and rule by the whispers of the books and the will of the Keeper.¬†¬†

And I was its key.¬†¬†

Every person I touched, every book I wrote, every letter I sent‚Äîall of it was spreading the library‚Äôs influence.¬†¬†

I wanted to stop. I wanted to scream, to fight, to burn every book I could find. But the library wouldn‚Äôt let me.¬†¬†

Because deep down, a part of me didn‚Äôt want to stop.¬†¬†

The last time I saw my reflection, I didn‚Äôt recognize myself.¬†¬†

My face was gone, replaced by swirling ink and shifting words. My body wasn‚Äôt flesh anymore; it was paper and shadow, hollow and endless.¬†¬†

And yet, I felt... complete.¬†¬†

The library had taken everything from me, but it had given me something too: purpose.¬†¬†

Last night, I wrote a new letter. My hand moved on its own, scrawling the words with ink that seemed to bleed from my fingers. When it was done, I sealed it and left it on the doorstep of a man down the street.¬†¬†

I don‚Äôt know his name. I don‚Äôt need to.¬†¬†

He‚Äôll find his way. They always do.¬†¬†

And soon, he‚Äôll join us.¬†¬†

The library is coming.¬†¬†

And nothing can stop it.¬†¬†",5,1737800881.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1i9k4zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1i9k4zu/success_story_positive_read/,Success Story (Positive Read),"Hello, I tried not read this reddit while I was actively going through my challenges related to taking Moxifloxacin. I was too fragile and any negative story would make me break down. I had my boyfriend go through this reddit and read to me only the positive stories. I cried when some guy said he was hiking again 40k steps in a day. This gave me a more positive outlook and I think that helped with recovery. 

I took 3 of the 7 pills I was prescribed before my legs started being extremely affected. I was unable to walk or even stand up in the kitchen without leaning on something to cook. I am 34 male. 33 male at the time of injury. After two weeks I was able to walk flat distances but had a muscle twisting feeling behind my right knee and I thought it was tendonitis. I had a multitude of symptoms ranging from toes, legs, arms, fingers. Twitching, tingling, pain, twisting feeling, too tired to hold phone up, Neuropathy. 

I had recently started seeing a trainer and was in the best shape of my life right before this happened. Not being able to workout was a tremendous hit to my life coping skills that I had developed after stopping drinking alcohol. I had very bad days but after 8 months I am confident enough to come on here and say that I am 99% back to what I was before. 

Since being injured I have walked 14 miles in one day. Consistently back to lifting weights, working out, hiking, riding bikes, playing pickleball, workout classes, yoga. I started taking all the supplements that everyone recommended. R-ALA, NAD+, D3, Magnesium, Vitamin C. Not drinking alcohol probably helped. Although I did drink twice during this just to have a release and not be so serious. I think one time it helped my mental capacity- the other it didn't.  I also eat pretty clean. (Meats, Fruit, Veggies, Cottage Cheese, Greek Yogurt, Maple Syrup, Nuts, Black Coffee, Sourdough) But I would have probably healed just the same if I didn't do anything honestly and time is the biggest healer. 

  
I saw a neurologist and they didn't really tell me anything, she was like if you're getting better than you're probably good. They wanted to do a spinal MRI and some leg tap thing - I didn't do them because I was gonna see if I got better on my own which I did.

I haven't had any twitching in about a month and a half maybe 2 months and no real pain either. I hope this post gives someone hope that this does heal!!! I don't really want any DMs because I do want to move on from this experience.",4,1737800658.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

1i9k2sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i9k2sy/more_than_a_year_into_the_future/,More than a year into the future,"Good evening,

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve posted. The sorrow, guilt, heartbreak, and stress of life has eased itself. Ive learned and evolved from all my experiences, still hanging onto the playlist I made for you.

I‚Äôve met a beautiful girl who accepts me and loves me for who I am. I feel the same for her, converging beliefs, opinions, and fascinating discussions and personalities between the two of us encourage and warm my soul. She ignites the best parts of me, I have 0 insecurities with her and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to be help within her warm arms at the end of the day. We are going on our 5th month dating, isn‚Äôt that crazy to think it‚Äôs almost been 2 years that we haven‚Äôt chatted.

I‚Äôm not going to deny that I am curious how life is treating you, and I‚Äôm unsure if you even keep up with my posts this far into the future.

How much would it hurt, for us to share one more coffee exchange at the place we first planned to meet. For such a gifted, amazing, and talented person I could only see you climbing the waves and curbs of everyday life. You know where to reach me.

Allow this to by me toast to our new lives, I hope everything and everyone is treating you well.

With my sincere wishes,
