So, for the record, I'm not diagnosed with ADHD but I highly speculate I have it. I am currently, because of a paper I wrote earlier this week which left me incredibly stressed and the election today, struggling with racing thoughts. It's like my brain is constantly wired and I cannot calm it down. It being wired isn't unusual for me and I usually counter-act it with coffee, but in the evenings I've usually been tired with my brain slowing down, which isn't the case the past few days. 

How do I calm down, both, the anxiety and racing thoughts? I don't mind thinking about things before bed but I wanna think about things I actually wanna think about which I can't do either at the moment because I am so focused on the stress. How do I distract myself? Obviously this also comes with sleeping issues since I can't stop thinking about the stuff that's going down, which does not help.

Thanks for any help... ",1,1730923845.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1gl7rau,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gl7rau/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_parents/,AITA for refusing to help my parents,"So I (18 years old) come from a Vietnamese family living in Germany. As the only person capable speaking german fluently in the family I am often tasked with going to any appointment that revolves about healthcare, finances, filing paper work, making calls from a young age. Although, I speak German fluently I speak Vietnamese worst than a Vietnamese elementary student. I was learning Vietnamese through talking with my parents but when that declined because of a rocky relationship my Vietnamese didn‘t improve. This makes communicating with my parents even more difficult. 
Fast forward, being in my last year in school I have a very important exam coming up this week. Because my parents don‘t believe that I could achieve anything in school, I tend not to tell them about anything school related, they barely ask either. Naturally, I didn‘t tell them about this exam. I was sleep-deprived and had a mild cold on this day. I really dreaded the school day and just wanted to go home to rest. 
When I got home, first thing my mom does is mentioning a letter she got from the bank. She wants me to go with her to clear up a misunderstanding. I was already dreading this since I just wanted to lay in my bed. When the bank opened after lunch break, my mom immediately wanted to go but I really didn‘t. I felt declined to leave the house for the rest of the day because of my cold and had studying to do for my exam. But I thought communicating this was useless as she would just not care. When I said that I wanted to go later (I wanted to rest first) or on another day, she demanded that we go now. Things got heated as she was fed up of asking me. Eventually both of my parents were screaming at me. How dare I not help them when they‘ve already asked me so many times. How dare I defy my parents wishes. Eventually I got up from my bed and we went to the bank. 
As my mom was already upset, I felt embarrassed when she repeatedly screamed about the misunderstanding at the bank. I felt bad for the worker who was just doing her job and following their regulations. Being a translator to my mother is a pain too, she never lets me finish hearing what the workers have to say because she wants me to say her argument next, she interrupts the conversation to get me to translate her point and her instructions are vague. Eventually, the thing was over and I walked out of there fed up and embarrassed. 
As the evening arrives and I try to take a short nap, I hear her screaming to my Dad how she‘s going to kill my cat. I‘m used to her screaming so I try to sleep. Perhaps my cat peed in the wrong spot, I don‘t think she would have killed her for real. The screams continued but I couldn‘t understand the content anymore. My Dad suddenly walks into my room, clearly fed up too, he is arguing loudly that I should never bring my boyfriend here anymore and that he should never step his foot into this house again. I was used to them using my boyfriend as a punishment. I didn‘t know how my cat had something to do with my boyfriend though so I asked him „What“s going on“? He went on about how my mom needs to wake me up everyday for school (she doesn‘t need to, I can get up by myself). How dare I make my mom feed the cat and buy the cat food. How dare I always give her headaches. I answered him that I give my mom money everytime she asks to buy cat food. If she didn‘t want to feed my cat anymore, she could have honestly told me and I would‘ve done it myself. He wanted to continue screaming at me but stopped mid-sentence. I thought that maybe he realised that he was venting his frustrations at me? I don‘t know why he suddenly stopped but he closed my door and argued with my mom about how it‘s always about money with her and that she‘s always sending it to Vietnam (the usual argument they have) and then he talked about how she celebrated her birthday with her friends and didn‘t even notify her husband or child. I guess he was frustrated about that recent birthday situation too and never showed it. She argued back that she was only drinking coffee with her friends and that‘s only a form of self-care and that‘s funny coming from him as he gambles his money away (usual argument here too, for info my Dad doesn‘t gamble all his money away as you think, it‘s those bets you make with friends only). Although these arguments kinda sound tame written out, they really scream loudly to the point my neighbours could understand them clearly if they spoke Vietnamese. 
Anyway, my Mom comes angrily into my room demanding things like that I give her her necklace back and stuff. She went on about how she regrets bearing the pain of giving birth to me, that she regrets having taken care of me all the time and that I couldn‘t even help her once. She has been mad about what happened in the afternoon all day and it has given her a headache. That I‘m a horrible child and that family should always help each other out. She‘s done so much for me and I can‘t even help her. I didn‘t have much to say only that I can live without her help of waking me up or making me food and that she makes it so difficult for me to translate. She said that she does everything for me, she washes my laundry, sweeps my room and I can‘t even help her and that it would be embarrassing to have her friends help her since she has a child that is obligated to help her and that as long as I live under their roof that I‘d have to help them. 
I didn‘t have much sympathy for her when she went mad till the point of getting teary-eyed because of our bad relationship. In Vietnamese culture it‘s a given that as a child I have the obligation to help my parents out. That thought always made me kind of sad that the purpose of my birth was to help my parents contrary to the belief of other parents who had a child to bring them joy. I remember going to all of their appointments from when I was only 10 years old. I really grew tired of it but still I helped them out. If all the pain my mother felt during my birth and all my purpose was to help them out with getting their life together in Germany, I would‘ve preferred not being born. It is true that they‘ve kept me fed and gave up their money to give me clothes and other necessities but isn‘t that their duty as parents? I do think that it is reasonable for me to repay them with helping them out when needed but is it really fair to have me handle all their appointments, all the paperworks they have to file, file their taxes and take on these tasks from a young age that were meant for adults just because they fulfilled their duty as parents? I find it hard to find sympathy and gratefulness when all they‘ve done is their role as a parent and now they remand something back from their child who did not necessarily beg them to be born and be forced to bear all their bureaucratic work. If they asked me to do all of the household duties myself, I could live without their help. But when it comes to my job, they‘d have to ask someone else to do it for them. Even though I helped them all these years I don‘t feel like they appreciate it and rather see it as my duty as their child.

1gl7q0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shaw/comments/1gl7q0q/rogers_communications_unveils_new_ecofriendly/,Rogers Communications Unveils New Eco-Friendly Plan: Employees to Generate Electricity by Taking Calls (Satire),"Rogers Communications Unveils New Eco-Friendly Plan: Employees to Generate Electricity by Taking Calls


by Sydney Zinger, Blazin' Satire News


Toronto, ON – In a bold move toward sustainability (and perhaps a touch of cost-cutting), Rogers Communications announced this week its latest green initiative: generating the entire office’s electricity supply directly from its own workforce of customer service representatives.


Dubbed “Energize the Solution,” the initiative requires each call center employee to sit in a specially designed “Power Pod” while on the job. These ergonomic marvels feature foot pedals, hand cranks, and a “morale-powered” heart rate monitor. With each call, the emotional energy, heavy sighs, and occasional stifled screams from employees are converted directly into clean, renewable power. Management has branded the pods as an innovative solution to the rising costs of both electricity and employee burnout.


""Here at Rogers Communications, we believe every frustrated sigh, every gritted tooth, every bit of passive-aggressive 'Thank you for holding' is energy just waiting to be harnessed,"" said Rogers CEO Tony Staffieri. ""Our employees have an incredible capacity for generating power under pressure.""


‘Employee-Powered Power’


The “Power Pods” were invented by Dr. Norman Buzzington, an engineer turned “motivation technician” who previously developed the “Mood Meter” now used by HR to monitor customer service representatives for “excessively unmotivated behavior.” Dr. Buzzington explained that the new system takes advantage of the naturally heightened adrenaline of call center agents during high-stress calls, converting it into kinetic energy that powers the lights, computers, and HVAC system.


""We started with basic foot pedals, but the wattage they generated was disappointing,"" Buzzington explained. ""Then we looked at hand-cranked generators, but they interfered with typing. But when we realized the latent power in passive-aggressive energy? We knew we were onto something special.”


According to Rogers Communications sustainability report, the average employee can generate approximately 3 watts per call, enough to power a high-efficiency LED bulb for several minutes. On a particularly difficult day, such as a Monday morning or during a system outage, the call center can run almost entirely off the pure frustration of its employees.


Incentives for High Energy


Management assures employees that there are incentives to embrace their new dual role as customer support reps and electricity producers. For every 100 watts generated, employees earn a “Buzzington Bonus” — a 15-minute “recharging” break. And for those who consistently produce high wattage, there’s a chance to win prizes like an extra headset or an ergonomic stress ball. The company has also started giving out awards for “Most Electrifying Call of the Month” to the employee who generates the most kilowatts in a single call.


“I used to just tell people what they wanted to hear to get them off the phone,” said Karla in the billing department. “But now? I keep them on the line. I really listen. The angrier they get, the more kilowatts I rack up, and every kilowatt is one step closer to that sweet, sweet break.”


Concerns from Labor Advocates


Unsurprisingly, some critics question the ethics of Rogers' program. Labor activists have raised concerns about potential overworking and how the focus on kilowatt generation is affecting employees’ mental health. Additionally, some employees report side effects from high wattage demands, such as “treadmill shin,” “crank thumb,” and what has been described as “an intense desire to chuck a computer out the window.”


When asked about these concerns, Rogers management pointed to a recent employee satisfaction survey that shows “green” is now the favorite color among the staff. ""It's clear they appreciate our environmental efforts,"" said HR manager Marisa Fabiano, ""and any extra pressure they feel is simply fueling our commitment to clean energy.""


To allay concerns, Rogers has promised to conduct a study on the health impacts of constant pedaling and cranking, though this will be funded by reducing coffee breaks from 10 minutes to 7 minutes. They’re also considering “Energy Appreciation Week,” which will include workshops on topics like “Stress as Power” and “Burnout as a Renewable Resource.”


The Future is Now


Despite the backlash, other corporations are watching closely, curious to see if they too can lower their energy bills by rebranding employee frustration as a power source. As CEO Tony Staffieri put it, “At Rogers, our employees are always ‘empowered.’ Now they’re empowering us back. Isn’t that beautiful?”


Only time will tell if “Energize the Solution” will become a model for sustainable workplaces nationwide—or merely another example of corporate greenwashing. Either way, as one Rogers employee put it, “We’ll keep powering through, because honestly, what choice do we have?”",1,1730923598.0,shaw,0,1.0,False
1gl7p1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/vending/comments/1gl7p1v/big_business_office_locations/,Big business office locations ,"Hello guys,

Lately I have been trying to get in big offices meaning 150-500 people sometimes more.

1.The issue is that contacting them is very difficult. Emailing is useless, and usually you can't get in and there is security. As of now I have made nice small booklets that are informative and let them know about my service. I talk to the guard and a receptionist usually comes out and delivers it to the person responsible for this kind of stuff.I feel like thereight be a better way though...
How do you deal with this issue?

2. Also I wanted to ask how do you guys react when a big office is okay with having a machine but has some kind of small coffee/sandwich shop in it. Usually these work from morning till 3-4 pm. In my opinion you can be a complimentary option and offer different options. Also some hours there are big waiting lines in these shops so you can be a nice quick option for a soda or something small. Am inapproching this correctly? Of course ideally you wanna be the only option but that's not always easy.",1,1730923531.0,vending,0,1.0,False
1gl7ocr,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1gl7ocr/celebrity_reflection_review_cococay_sailing/,Celebrity Reflection - Review (coco-cay sailing),"Dates: Nov-1-3 (3 Nights)

Itinerary: FLL - Sea Day - Coco Cay - FLL



**Point of View:**

Overall 2nd cruise but first time with Celebrity. Previous cruise is a 7-day alaskan itinerary with Discovery Princess. We usually don't take a 3 day itinerary, but due to a tight timelines, we had to. Also, we are neither fans nor haters of any line. I'll try to provide my best and honest review.

**Ship:**

One word - Gorgeous. For its age, she has been maintained quite well. Every nook and corner look very premium. Love the ambient lighting in the ship. Even public restrooms felt very luxurious. The layout is pretty good, we feel the foyer on decks 3,4,5 felt rather small. It doesn't necessarily has a nicer flow, but not really felt like an issue. Loved the areas of Hideaway, Library, iLounge on the passenger decks, but we couldn't use much (more on the Vibe section). Elevators were very nice, there is a tree hanging in the elevator bank and you can view the interior all the way up to deck 14. Nice size pools and solarium. Plenty of loungers all over. You ""may"" not get a pool side chair, but you will sure get something nearby. Solarium felt more premium space with padded loungers. Crew does remove unattended items, towels to prevent chair hogging. Celebrity also provides complimentary Sunscreen lotions on the pool deck, which is a nice touch. Lawn garden and Sunset bar were excellent spaces, but almost always busy. I personally didn't like the layout of the Lawn Garden and they do not have bean bags during our trip (we saw in one of the YT ship tours). So, you either have to sit on the grass or grab a towel to make a little picnic. Love the Sky observation deck, especially in the mornings when its almost empty. This ship didn't cover the forward part of the ship with a pay wall (yet), so we can access that area, which is very nice.

**Embarkation & Vibe:**

Embarkation is very smooth. The staff were exceptional at handling crowds, they were very polite and efficient. We had a the Premium Access (more on that later), but we didn't even need to use that. We reached the cruise port around 11:30ish and its not at all crowded. There were some waters kept at boarding (a nice touch). It is a very busy ship, appears like fully sold out. The Crowd, however, is a mixed bag of party-focused and relaxation-seeking. Guests were also very polite and courteous to others. The ship, however, tried to keep the vibe more towards the party. Almost every evening, there is loud music (DJ, singers, bands) on Deck3, because the space is open up all the way to Deck 14 at the elvator bank, the sound spreads all the way to the top. So, in the evening the Hide away and Library and other areas were not at all quiet. Which is a bummer for us, but can't complain (Not sure if the same goes for 7 day itineraries too). Having said that, we were still able to find quiet spots on the ship. Loved the evenings on Lawn garden and Promenade on Deck 5. Mornings were exceptional in the Sky observation lounge Or the walking path. 

**Room:**

We booked a balcony room on Deck 7. Room is very nice and clean. I know Bed is a kinda personal preference, but I loved it. The space is a bit bigger too. Love the size of the balcony. Even the ship is old, the room still felt a bit premium. There were a few areas, you can see it a bit dated, but not much really. The yellow lights in the room, however, make you go back in time :D. They replaced the couch with a new one and ""one"" chair replaced in the balcony with a new one. Bathroom is of a good size and shower capsule is big for a cruise ship standards. I am very impressed with the water pressure of the shower. Also love the quality of the bath products (especially the moisturizer). Shout out to Agus, our room steward, who did an exceptional job of keeping our room clean. Celebrity does provide 2 times service (morning and nightly turn down). He also provided pillow chocolates, another nice touch. 

**Dining:**

Food is very subjective. But we found that food quality is very good in both MDR and Buffet. Its surely better than Princess dining (about 25% better). Celebrity makes bread and croissants much better than princess. Princess's Lido pizza and Danish pastries were much better than celebrity. I also feel that there isn't much variety on celebrity in general. 

**Main Dining Room** \- Although food quality is very good, the organization is not. It felt like the team don't have much clarity. I had one rude experience from the staff that got quickly resolved by the supervisor. Staff in general were very polite, courteous and efficient, but not warm. It feels like they don't mean what they say. It felt like scripted and coming directly from the corporate marketing team. The main problem I felt is that they were understaffed and everyone seemed overworking. You can literally see in their faces that they were not happy. So, they just say and do what they needed to do. Not even once, the MDR supervisors approached our table and asked if everything okay. Princess was way better at hospitality. 

**Buffet** \- The food is above average to good quality in the buffet. It gets busy during the peak times (as every cruise), but we were able to find some seats in the shoulder hours of peak times. The space is organized very well and almost no queues to pick-up any item. Although it had ""enough"" variety, certainly less than princess. There aren't any staff asking us if we wanted a drink / coffee etc. but they were cleaning up the empty plates pretty quickly. Again, the issue of understaffing. On the debarkation day, someone came to our table with the coffee cart and asked to give him a review and 10 rating. We never saw anyone on the other days. 

**Room Service** \- Room service menu is very limited (hardly 4 items to choose), we haven't gotten room service during the day or the night. We, however, used their breakfast delivery. For regular guests, Continental morning breakfast in room is included. we felt its a pretty decent selection for the breakfast items. You'd need to fill-in the form and put on the door handle before 2AM and you'll get your breakfast delivered on the time you mentioned. They'll give you a courtesy call before someone show up. For Premium access guests, you can have Hot breakfast (eggs, hash browns) delivered too (Room service fee and gratuity is waived). For others, it will cost $9.95 + 20% gratuity per order.

We haven't dined in any speciality dining since its a very short cruise.

**Drinks:**

One word - Overpriced 

Beers are not priced equal, like Heineken is $9, and Stella is $11. White wine is $12-15, Red wine is $17-19. Funniest part is, 4 glasses of ""Decoy"" cabernet costs $68.. and they were selling the bottle (4 glasses) for $70 (Nickel and Dime 101). And add a 20% gratuity on top of everything. And sign a receipt for every drink you take. Basic mixed drinks doesn't even feel if they have any alcohol in them. Now, the part that I hated the most is that you don't even know the price of liquors. There aren't any menus (only some bars have) for you to see how much does this cost. You have to ""ask"" someone to get the price of everything. This is super stressful (may be that's the idea). Even if you have a classic drink package, there were only a very limited selection of drinks you can get. The ""good"" drinks start at $17 and goes a lot above. In this entire thing, I am not even mentioning about speciality cocktails at World Class Bar. I still can justify the price tag there because they really were amazing. Rather than delighting the customer, they were squeezing the customer in this area.   

Well, if you think that they were made with premium liquors and celebrity is a premium line. I don't find Titos vodka to be a premium vodka to justify that. Also, I might ask you to check either Disney, Virgin and Viking drink prices. They are also very premium lines with premium drinks which are priced very less than celebrity. You can compare beer prices, wine prices and mixed cocktails. I am not including Princess in this, they are the best in the industry for their drink packages, you can literally have a full bottle of McAllen Quest for free in their premium package. So, with my limited intelligence, I couldn't really justify the price from whatever angle I see. If you find the value in them, I salute to you.

**Coco-cay:**

Summary - Best experience, Exceptionally well maintained

What can I say, it is really awesome. The beaches were very clean and in excellent condition. There were signs everywhere, thousands of lounge chairs with umbrellas. They were nicely color coded for 2-seater, 4-seater. White sands, awesome beaches. We were in the south beach most of the time, it was so lively with music and games. Nice bars all around. I loved the snack shack a lot. What a little decent spread of items. Simple, subtle and very good quality food and a very fast service. There were multiple beverage stations near it, so no waiting/lines. We didn't even go to buffet, snack shack was sufficient for us. Royal Caribbean perfected this island. Love every part of it. 

**Service:**

Overall, the vibe of the service seems stressed out. I can see they are severely understaffed. I rarely found any waiter at the pool or near the bar areas to ask and get you a drink. There is ""one"" waiter I found in the Solarium, who took more than 30 mins to deliver a beer after waiting 30 mins to order. There aren't anyone in the buffet or other areas even to ask. Dining room waiters were as I mentioned above, polite, courteous, efficient, but not warm. We haven't seen the supervisor coming to our table, not even once, and ask ""how's everything going"". I don't know how better to put it, may be I had a better expectation from Celebrity.

**Entertainment:**

Live music at different places. There was a night party on the pool deck, and Production shows were good. We are not really entertainment people, so we use to find a quiet place almost every time.

**Premium Access:**

I don't think anyone needs it. We didn't use much of the wifi (only 1 device, that too just for messages). Once we ordered hot breakfast and once a premium seating in theater. Embarkation and Debarkation is very smooth that you don't need any special thing. 

**Nickel & Diming:**

Its a beautiful and premium ship and all the basic items such as food, coffee (not speciality), tea, ice-tea, water etc. are included (Like any other cruise line). Most nickel and dime I saw in the drinks. I have already touched upon them in the Drinks section. Personally, the most irritating thing is to sign a receipt. I mean, really? Also, the classic drink package doesn't give you much and the premium (or whatever) drink package is about $110 pppd. Even then, it only covers drinks upto $17. That means, if you take a red pinot wine, you still had to pay an extra $2. I also feel the reduction in the staff in MDR is kinda their push for speciality dining. Nonetheless, it failed to create a memorable experience. We have received a future cruise form BEFORE the sailing, which is very weird. Surprisingly, we haven't seen much of a sales pressure anywhere. We got approached for drinks package on the embarkation day, but thats it. 

**Overall Summary:** 

Its a real mixed-bag of feelings for us. Its a beautiful ship, looks premium, felt premium. Food is fantastic. Room is awesome with extraordinary room steward. Dining Service is mediocre with fabricated greetings/responses, mostly because they were very hard-working and severly understaffed. Drinks were outrageously expensive with that additional receipt sign. At this point, I am not really sure if some of the issues were because of a 3 day sailing and mostly not there on 7 day sailings. And the drink prices fluctuate? like they are this expensive for party cruises, and normalize for others? I really would love to hear from others on this sailing OR in general celebrity sailings. 

As far as us concerned, well, celebrity didn't really stood out. I mean, at the similar price points, we have Virgin, Disney and Princess available. Sometimes, celebrity costs as much as upper premium lines like Oceania, Viking, Azamara. Where most of the things included. We are not there to exclude celebrity completely, but not our first choice for the next cruise. 

If you come this far. Thank you and I hope I have provided some useful insights. 

**Answers to a few questions I asked earlier in the sub:**

1. Water - Ship water is perfectly fine we carried a few re-usable bottles and used those. Buffet has water fountain, most guests fill from there. There are no water stations in the lower decks. (I expected near restrooms, but no). We also ordered water package for the other room, but you really don't need it. 

2. Phone - we used the stateroom phone to call other party, which is really cool (Retro vibes :D)

3. Housekeeping - Two times a day

4. Premium Access - There are signs and areas we found, but really you don't need them. Its very smooth without it as well.

What a pleasant surprise! I thought she would be shattered and depressed over the election results, but she was in a great mood. She even made me coffee! (RARE!)

Then came the strangeness. First, she wouldn't let me brush my teeth, and she asked me to put on this blonde wig. I'm balding and not very attractive, so I thought, maybe she just wants me to look like her work boyfriend. (he's a surfer dude type). And I was fine with that.

But then I realized, oh my god...this wig looks like Donald Trump's hair. I tried to post a picture of the wig so you can see it, but I can't figure out how.

And she was enjoying the love making a little too much. She usually closes her eyes or wears a blindfold but today she wouldn't break eye contact with me.

So now I've got this crazy feeling that my wife actually voted for Donald Trump. I wonder if her work boyfriend has been influencing her. Like I said, he's a tall surfer dude type. A total bro.

I don't mind wearing the blonde wig during love making but I can't shake the idea that she voted for Trump. I don't know how I'll get past this. She's at her boyfriend's house right now but when she gets home we are going to have a talk. I'm freaking out, idk...help",0,1730923432.0,relationship_advice,1,0.25,False

It seems like they are taking items that they just have on stock that they get in bulk with no expiration date and padding the pick up bags with junk.

Generally, it is the one of parents (let's call them A) being suspicious about other one's fidelity, and other one (B) being unhappy with first one's stalking habits. Sometimes, general dissatisfaction also gets swayed in (Parent A feels underappreciated and uninvolved into housekeeping). Occasionally, parent A would not go into argument with parent B, dropping all their frustration on wither me or my sibling(17).

Here is where problem comes. I (22) am trying the best to be polite kid, often taking parent A onto trips to museums/galleries/other places they enjoy, and spending time together, and sibling and I are the ones to take on the punch first when parent A is angry or frustrated (being yelled at on bi-weekly basis is a norm). Time to time, we also are brought into their person-to-person argument despite us opposing it every time (we do not want to take sides). 

Last time, parent A came home drunk and got very angry over the same argument point. Parent A asked us to back them up in argument. We stood mostly quiet, with me trying to find best variant of what to say and my sibling soon explaining that he does not want to engage into argument. 

Parent A yelled about how noone appreciates them and stormed away.  
Soon, sibling and I got messages how we are the traitors and few more implying parent A doesn't want to be our parent anymore.

Usually, I work at home but today left to work at coffee shop to avoid another fit of yelling while dealing with other stress. I feel bad for everything that happened, and especially for avoiding staying at home now, unsure of parent A's mood.

Firstly, thanks for all of your help in this group so far. Reading your posts gives me hope and keeps me motivated. 

I started my 'all in-ish"" journey 3 weeks ago. I stopped all running (I was running 5 miles a day before) and most strength training (I was doing about an hour of strength training before.) I am only walking and doing pilates. I am eating a lot more, consistently having snacks, starting with food in the morning, not doing any exercise fasted, and I have cut out all coffee.

SO, last week, I'm pretty sure I ovulated. I took my first ovulation test when I was feeling symptoms (starting with a very bad headache) and it was .95 T/C ratio. In the following days, I got really bad cramps on my lower right belly and really tender nipples. 

Anyway, that was last Tuesday, then yesterday after my walk, I checked my underwear and I had red/brown discharge on it. I had a little more red/brown discharge that morning, but then NOTHING else. This morning, again, after my walk, I had a little bit of red/brown discharge, but nothing else. 

  
Was this a period...??? I want to be excited but it feels kind of anticlimatic because when I used to get my cycle, it was always very strong. I was expecting my period to come on full force today and yesterday to have just been a light day, but alas, nothing.

I pay rent at my moms house. It's technically also my house since I'm on the title. Recently my grandma has been so rude to me and disses everything I do as a mother. Makes comments saying I don't know how to take care of a baby. I never know what I'm doing. Gets mad at me for being upset that she's tried to offer my baby coffee and salted chips when my baby hasn't even started hard solids. She made a comment yesterday to the wind about how much she misses my sister and how my sister makes her so happy. 
She'll clean up after my mom and sister, and even goes OUT of her way to clean my brothers house once a week, but will not help me with anything. She'll leave any dish I use in the sink if she's washing here. She complains that I don't clean the bathroom as often as she wishes. She told me that the bathroom trash is only MY trash because she keeps her trash in her room. 
She'll make comments to my baby about me when I'm around (and not so nice ones - very passive) 
She doesn't respect me at all. 
NO ONE contributes to the groceries. I buy groceries EVERY WEEK and I don't even have a full time job - but my grandma and mom will use everything I buy. I didn't mind at first until I realized it's been two months since they have contributed.

Am I the problem?,"This is my first ever relationship. Recently my boyfriend has been getting upset with me for not doing enough and he says I’m neglecting him. Telling me I need to I need to work on myself to be able to nurture him.

So I do try and do better for myself by Recently deciding to finally find a psychiatrist to at least get closure for the problems I’ve been struggling with for so long. Which ended up being ADHD and Depression, I did began to suspect I had ADD when I couldn’t study right unless I’m in a small closet to force away distractions. When I decided to try to get into books again but I’d read a whole page and completely don’t remember anything I just read. Forgetfulness etc.

We’ve only been together since June 19 of this year. I’m going to start with the first time he got upset with me. So it was July a month after we started dating, he began to ask me if I’m forgetting something and questioning me if I knew what was coming up. First I’m like “no why?” But he kept being vague and made it seem like I was missing something, which made me nervous so I wasn’t confident in what to say. After going back and forth I began to question if it was about the date of the month, he still wasn’t confirming but it was obvious that he was getting irritated. Then I was thinking about how the next day was the 19th which was the date we began dating but I wasn’t confident enough to assume that’s what he was talking about.

Then I finally asked him if he was talking about the next day being the 19th. He still didn’t say yes or no and replied with “what do you think.” So I realized it’s about the date we first met. I don’t remember if I asked him or just thought to myself of why he’s bringing it up. But he was upset and told me I forgot about our anniversary, he said females should be counting down to that day. He also began to tell me that he’s the man and he shouldn’t be the one who’s more adamant about an anniversary it’s like a female thing and I should have been excited and remembered. He then asked if I even had the date we started to date in my calendar and I should have cause on the day he put it in his. 

I genuinely didn’t know anniversary’s were monthly, I always thought an answer would be in a year so the day wasn’t on my mind. I tried to tell him that I did remember the date we started dating but he didn’t believe. 

-Another situation where he got upset with me is where one night with him I wanted to stay in because of my cramps. He was totally fine with it, he also kept mentioning there was a car event going on but not in a direct way, just speaking of it. I was with him the night before and I remembered him mentioning it. The next day I’m otp with him and he brings up the car meet again talking about how we missed it. I didn’t say anything at first but I was thinking like geez he must really wanted to go. He brings it up again and I just say “I would have went with you.” Me saying it cause I feel bad that we didn’t go cause I wanted to stay in cause of my cramps.

He goes silent for a little bit then he tells me what I said didn’t sit right with him. Obviously I’m confused, but he then said “Oh you want to stay in when it comes to spend time with your man but now you’re saying you’d go if it’s car related.” He then continued to say that I’m probably with him just for the car stuff. (hard for me to fully recall) but I tried to tell him that I said that cause I feel bad since he kept bringing it up. I don’t know why he said that cause we’ve spend time together all the time that’s not car related. (we’re both car enthusiasts) Even two nights ago when he first mentioned it we sat in his car for hours talking.

After that day I thought to myself that it felt like it was like a test, he was like waiting for me to say something that didn’t feel right to him and come up with that assumption he was already possibly thinking about. I just started to feel like I had to walk on eggshells with anything I say or do.

-Another situation where he got upset cause I didn’t stand up for him. He takes me to this sushi spot we’ve been to one other time. It’s about to close but they were nice enough to let us sit and get something small. The waitress is nice she gave us a free small slice cheese cake after we’re done. Boyfriend gives her the check and she comes back and mentions why he doesn’t tip her while she has a smile. She then mentions that she remembers that he didn’t tip last time. Apparently he doesn’t tip I’m finding out, I’m looking at him and he looks at the waitress and he comes up with some reason I can’t remember.
 
We’re walking back to the car and he’s clearly upset as we’re talking about the situation. We get in the car and he’s just silent, I’m also silent in my head I’m trying to figure out what to say. I asked him if he was okay and he responded with something short along of lines of not really can’t remember. Then silence again…at this point I’m internally trying to figure out what to do or say and what it if I say the wrong thing. 30 minutes go by and he began to drive, he tells me first he didn’t like how I was silent and secondly he doesn’t like how I let the waitress talk to him like that when she mentioned the no tip. He says I don’t stand up for my man, I could have told her to “chill out”, I’m too quiet, I didn’t comfort him etc. Yes I was silent the entire time, I tried to tell him I didn’t know what to say and I didn’t mean to stay quiet. In my head I was going over things I could say but also thinking if I’d say the wrong thing.

—Another. Fast forward, right now he’s upset with me cause recently he says I’m not nurturing, he says “females should already know how to be nurturing.” And him as a man he shouldn’t have to teach me it should be natural. He’s gotten upset with me once cause I couldn’t think off the top of my head of the different dishes I could cook for him fast enough. We don’t live together but he always talks about the future. He said he doesn’t know if I’m capable enough to take care of him and do woman things like feed him, make sure he’s mentally good, physically etc. He said he shouldn’t have to ask me to cook I should already want to for him. He said it could be a simple sandwich, I use to occasionally bring him food I made when I could afford the ingredients, I should of just asked him if we could just shop together. But I did stop for a while after I stopped working and I couldn’t really spend too much more. I live with my family and there always barley food in the house cause it’s always eaten so I’m limited on things I could make since he doesn’t eat meat and I’d go out and get the stuff. For that reason my boyfriend told me he’d start getting me snacks for us to both eat I can store in my room since he sleeps over almost everyday.

Recently he got off work and we were going to get some habachi but he stopped at the grocery store cause he remembered we ran out of a pack of waters. He got upset with me when I said “oh yeah.” when he mentioned the waters cause I’m not doing my role etc. In the store I noticed as I’m picking up certain things and asking him questions he is silent and he’s just shrug or say something short. Now I don’t know if he’s upset about something or what. Eventually and he got upset with me cause I was asking him about should we get instead of knowing what to get and take charge of that womanly stuff. He went on and said he can’t do everything my role is easy.

Same night he told me to remind him to order some break pads when we get back to my spot. I forgot, same night we’re in the room and he’s like “awe babe you forgot to tell me to order the pads.” Then the next day he brings that up when he got upset. 

So we’re at cars and coffee, walking around as we’re walking to into Coffee shop he’s like he’s gonna grab himself something to eat after. We’re in line and I’m looking at the pastries I see banana bread, he likes banana stuff. I ask him if he wants anything even though he never wants anything out of that place and he shrugs and like get whatever. I get a drink and get him the banana bread. He pays and we sit down. He’s like “did they get it from behind the glass?” I said “yeah.” He takes a little piece and tastes it then throws the rest out. He tells me why would I get him something that’s been sitting out, I should have higher standards like he does for me. I try to mention the pastries are made fresh everyday but he continued. He tells me just because I’m use to it doesn’t make it good or something like that.

—Now this is about the title—, the same night he got upset about I’m asking him for more and I’m not doing enough. This started him saying how things are going to be when I start my vet assistant job. Just said I’d be the same, but he was talking about finances. He always didn’t like when I paid for stuff when I’m with him, he’s adamant about being the provider. I still do it out of guilt sometimes if I think it’s much. But I tell him he’d pay for stuff if we’re together and going out to eat. And he mentioned who would pay to get my hair done…I always paid for my hair since it’s like 200$ I tell him I pay by default but like idk if we’re together I wouldn’t mind if you payed of offered since he doesn’t like when I pay for things in front of him. He then mentions that he said he was hungry earlier while he was getting off work. And since I didn’t say anything he said I wasn’t going to make him anything. I just got sidetracked with the job conversation, I tell him I was going to make something. We were at the grocery store yesterday and got several things for me to make for him after he got off work so why would I not? Then he loops back to me saying I would mind about him paying for hair and says I’m asking for more and all I do is take from him.

Then he’s continue to talk about how he’s sick of talking to me about these things, I should already be doing it, I’m not naturally nurturing, he’s on his own by the end of the day, asking me what is up with me, saying he can’t have a woman that fidgets with her fingers etc. He then goes on to telling me he feels like I’m bullshitting or wasting time and he should just leave, he can easily just leave cause he’s use to being on his own and us females always take stuff for granted. He comes to the house and tells me to bring out his clothes so he can go I tell him his stuff is in the washer, he’s getting mad at me cause I keep getting stuck with my words again. 

I go outside and he’s still talking about how I’m taking him for granted and “y’all females” be messing up relationships etc. Atp I’m just getting overwhelmed he hates when I breakdown or cry when he does this cause “it’s nothing to cry about.” I say how I’ve been trying to work on myself so I can be better for him and the relationship. He tells me I need to work on myself so I began to stutter and tear up as I’m trying not to cry, he gets more upset that I’m crying I tell him that I found a psychiatrist so I can get some clarity for my long struggles. And he says he thinks I’m lying cause I’m taking so long to spit it out. He then asked what’s the doctors name cause he thinks I’m lying. 

Once I mentioned I have a prescription (bupropion 75mg) he tells me in victimizing myself. And us girls always victimizes ourselves and we think being depressed is cute. He said why didn’t I tell him and I was being sneaky for not telling that I’m taking prescriptions. I just got the prescription a few days ago, I was going to tell him but I kept putting it off because he told me he said wouldn’t and wasn’t going to date to girl with mental issues in a previous time he was upset. I tell him cause what he said but he said that’s not an excuse and I knew what I was doing. He tells me I should have came to him first and I don’t need no meds, telling me that “adhd, aderall and antidepressants are white people shit.”

He then said I’m going to go die, I’m going to go back in my room and overdose cause of my depression and potential breakup. I kinda chuckled in the middle of crying in disbelief in what he said. He tells me he’s real he’s going to say what’s real, he said I’m going to be dependent on the meds and keep taking them until I kill myself. Telling me he’s not dealing with me if I change moods cause of meds. I mainly went there for my attention deficit I just want to try and start school again without hard struggles on simple task no matter what method I use. I tell him I thought that that’s what me working on myself was. I wanted to finally get help for my mental. Then he yells at me saying why would I go somewhere else to get help when he’s right there, that’s like him wanting p*ssy and going to a different girl.

After that I don’t know what to say, I’m telling him I should have told him before I went to go to the psychiatrist. He tells me I’m sneaky and he can’t trust or marry a woman like that. I go silent for a bit and he yells “Speak!” I freeze up a little and I began to try and talk about it more, he says I’m too timid and quiet it’s not grown woman like, he said it’s like he’s talking to a kid. I say I don’t have to take the meds and canceled my appointment today. 

I’m just lost right now, I know I’m faulty in a lot of things but I genuinely don’t know what. I’m sorry I wrote a whole essay y’all.",0,1730921924.0,relationship_advice,22,0.33,False
1gl70ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1gl70ug/my_thoughts_on_the_uvbrite_water_bottle_after_a/,My Thoughts on the UVBrite Water Bottle After a Month of Use,"So, I recently bought the **UVBrite Water Bottle**, a **self-cleaning drink bottle** that uses UV-C light to purify water. I’d heard a lot about self-cleaning bottles and finally decided to give one a try. After using it almost daily for the last month, I thought I’d share my thoughts with anyone who’s curious about whether it’s worth the investment.

# Why a Self-Cleaning Water Bottle?

I drink water all the time, especially when I’m on the go, but I’ve had issues with reusable bottles in the past. They often start to smell or get this weird taste even after frequent washing. I also travel and hike a lot, and I don’t always have access to fresh, filtered water. When I found out that the **UVBrite water bottle** could kill 99.99% of bacteria and viruses with UV-C light, I was intrigued. I figured, if it actually works, it would make my life a lot easier and my water safer.

# First Impressions – Quality and Design

When the bottle arrived, I was pretty impressed with the look and feel. It’s made from double-walled stainless steel, so it has a bit of weight, but it’s solid and doesn’t feel flimsy at all. It also keeps drinks cold or hot for hours, which is great if you’re like me and want your water chilled or your coffee hot for longer periods.

The bottle has a one-button design that’s really simple to use. Just press the button once for a 90-second cycle, which is great for regular tap water, or hold it down for 180 seconds for water from less reliable sources, like rivers or fountains. The cleaning indicator light makes it easy to tell when it’s working, and it doesn’t make any noise during the cycle, which I appreciate.

# Using UVBrite in Real Life

The main reason I got this bottle was for the **self-cleaning feature**. The UVBrite activates a self-cleaning cycle every six hours to prevent any bacteria buildup. This was perfect for me because I often leave water in my bottle overnight or forget to wash it after a workout. After using it for a while, I’ve noticed that my water always tastes fresh, even if it’s been sitting in the bottle for a day or so.

Another thing that’s been great is the insulation. This is the first bottle I’ve owned that actually keeps my drinks cold for most of the day. I filled it with ice water in the morning, and it was still cold by late afternoon. The same goes for hot drinks, which stay warm for hours.

# Does the UV-C Purification Actually Work?

Now, I don’t have a lab to test for bacteria levels, but I can tell you that I’ve used the **UVBrite water bottle** with various water sources, including public fountains and taps, and the water tastes clean. I haven’t had any stomach issues or noticed any bad smells, so I feel confident that it’s doing its job. The UV-C light technology is also used in hospitals and water treatment plants, so I feel reassured that it’s effective for personal use.

The **self-cleaning drink bottle** has been a lifesaver on my hikes. Instead of carrying a bulky filter or having to bring several bottles, I can fill up at streams or fountains and purify it with the UV light. It’s not designed for murky water, but it works great for any clear water sources I’ve come across.

[**Here’s another link if you want to learn more.**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Pros and Cons

# Pros

* **Self-Cleaning Feature**: The automatic cleaning every six hours is awesome. My water bottle never smells, and I feel comfortable leaving water in it without worrying.
* **Purifies with UV-C Light**: Kills 99.99% of bacteria and viruses, which is great for those of us who fill up from different sources.
* **Insulated Design**: It keeps my drinks cold or hot for hours, which is perfect for long days out.
* **Rechargeable Battery**: I only need to charge it about once every three weeks, even with daily use. It charges via USB, so it’s easy to plug in at night and have it ready to go.

# Cons

* **Price**: It’s a bit on the expensive side for a water bottle, but the features and peace of mind make it worth it, in my opinion.
* **Weight**: It’s heavier than a standard plastic bottle, which might be a drawback for some, but I find it durable and worth carrying.
* **Only Works with Clear Water**: The UV light can’t purify murky water, so it’s best for clear tap water or natural sources like rivers.

# Battery Life and Durability

One concern I had was how often I’d have to charge it. Turns out, the **UVBrite water bottle** lasts around 60 purification cycles on a single charge, which is about two to three weeks for me. I just charge it overnight once a month, and it’s good to go.

As for durability, this bottle has survived being tossed in my backpack and dropped on the ground. There’s no visible wear, and it still works perfectly. The stainless steel construction really holds up.

# Is It Worth Getting a Self-Cleaning Drink Bottle?

If you’re someone who uses a water bottle daily, or if you’re into hiking, traveling, or just want clean water on the go, I’d say the UVBrite is definitely worth it. The **self-cleaning feature** has made it easy to keep my bottle fresh without a lot of work. And knowing that the **UV-C light** is killing bacteria gives me peace of mind, especially when I’m filling up from unknown sources.

If you’re on the fence because of the price, think about how much you spend on bottled water or other filtration methods. I’ve already saved a lot by using this bottle instead of buying bottled water when I’m out. Plus, the environmental benefit of reducing plastic waste makes it a solid choice if you care about that kind of thing.

# Final Thoughts

Overall, I’m really happy with the UVBrite water bottle. It’s not just a regular bottle – it’s a **self-cleaning drink bottle** that actually makes a difference in my daily routine. I used to be frustrated by the smell that would build up in other bottles or worried about filling up from random sources. Now, I feel confident wherever I fill up, knowing that UVBrite’s UV-C technology has my back.

The bottle isn’t for everyone. If you’re just looking for something simple and lightweight, this might not be it. But if you’re someone who values clean water and hates dealing with cleaning out bottles, I’d definitely recommend it. The **UV-C purification**, long battery life, and sturdy build make it a good investment for anyone who’s active or just cares about having fresh, safe water all the time.",1,1730921888.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

1gl707v,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1gl707v/advice_on_finding_motivation_and_energy_after/,Advice on finding motivation and energy after work? I really want to improve myself.,"Seeking advice here. Any tips or advice would be appreciated.

I work an 8-4 desk job and it is my first full time job where I am sitting most of the day, working. I gained almost 20 pounds since April which is when I first started the job and I am struggling to go back to the lifestyle I used to live. All my previous jobs were very hands-on and had me actively moving throughout the shift. In addition to that, I was very motivated to go to the gym every day and to cook/eat healthy meals. But ever since I started this job (and don't get me wrong, I am very satisfied with the job itself), I find myself more exhausted than ever after work. The first thing I want to do when I get home from work is just stuff my face with food, scroll on social media, and lie down on my bed. I know in my head that it's unhealthy but my body is just physically so drained and feels sluggish the moment I step inside my home. I just want to crash in my bed but don't want to sleep early or take naps as I just end up sleeping through the entire night and never get anything done. I'm not really an avid coffee drinker either, I'll drink just one cup in the morning on days when I feel extra tired.

It's not like I live like this EVERY single day and I do try my best to get exercise when I can and have been reducing my portion sizes/eating healthier when it comes to meals. Recently, I started getting back into doing cardio 30 mins per day and using a habit tracker to motivate myself to check tasks off. I also have been trying my best to be in bed earlier so I can get at least 7-8 hours of sleep. In my head I know what I should be doing to live out a healthy lifestyle, but my body just doesn't seem to want to listen. Also seeing my body weight not go down has been very discouraging and makes me lose motivation even more. I also feel like time goes by so quickly after work --by the time I get home it's dinnertime and before I know it I have to go to bed without getting much done. 

Has anyone had similar experiences and/or have any tips/suggestions for finding motivation to actually do things that they want to do after work? Thanks for reading..

When I was 18 and my sister was 5, I was babysitting in our family’s basement while my mom was in the shower and my stepdad was asleep. I should mention that my stepdad has the deepest, most distinct voice I’ve ever heard. Anyone who meets him comments on it, and even customers at his job, who’ve only spoken to him on the phone, request his assistance by saying, ‘The one with the deep voice!’ This will become important later.

It was my mom’s birthday, so she was taking one of those long showers, and I knew she’d be in there for a while. I’d taken out some toys and turned on the TV, which was the only noise in the house besides maybe the faint sound of the shower.

Our basement is set up so that the sofa is directly against the wall next to the bottom of the stairs. When you’re sitting on it, if you turn to the right, you can see straight up the stairs. In front of us was the rest of the room: TV, coffee table, etc.

As a dumb 18-year-old who semi-loved taunting my sibling, I switched the channel to a scary movie. My sister glanced up at it briefly and proudly declared, ‘Sissy, I’m not scared.’ Of course, this took all the fun out of the situation, so I quickly turned off the TV and sat on my phone while my sister played on the floor with her toys.

After a while, I heard a voice from the top of the stairs that sounded vaguely familiar but could have been coming from no one in the house. Again, my mom was showering (I could still hear the running water), and my stepdad was asleep. It clearly wasn’t his distinct voice.

The voice was a woman’s. My entire body ran cold, and I froze, knowing that if I looked to the right, I would see someone—or something—standing at the top of the stairs. I glanced down at my sister, who also stood frozen, tears in her eyes, staring straight at me.

I didn’t want to scare her—even though she was already petrified—so I calmly asked, ‘What’s wrong, baby?’ She whispered, as if not to be overheard by whoever was on the stairs, ‘Who was that?’

I was still trying to stay brave, so I asked, ‘Who was what?’ and she replied, ‘Who said that?’

At that point, I knew she heard it too, and I knew I wasn’t going crazy. I asked her what the voice had said, and she repeated it back to me exactly as I had heard it.

The worst part of the whole thing was what it said and how it said it. In the calmest, almost absent voice, whatever stood at the top of those stairs said, ‘Hey, Kayleigh?’ Even typing it gives me the chills. That’s my name. There was no emotion in the statement, but the small bit of inflection at the end made it clear it was a question—and it was a question for me.

There was no way I was going to look up those stairs, and as I reached for my sister, she scrambled up and sat on my lap. We both stared straight ahead while we waited for my mom to finish her shower. After we heard the door open and her footsteps coming down the hall (about 10 minutes later), I was finally able to move. I carried my sister up the stairs and asked my mom if she had called me. She obviously said no—how could she? And she was right; there was no way it could’ve been her. My stepdad was still asleep.

The voice had been a woman’s. After explaining the whole situation to my mom, it dawned on me: The voice sounded familiar because it was my voice.

My mom was brought to tears just by hearing the story and seeing how affected my sister and I were. She immediately believed us.

This wasn’t the last time we heard that voice, either. My mom often calls me to let me know she’s heard my voice calling for her, but saying words I’d never use or things I wouldn’t say—things like ‘Mommy’ or ‘I need help.’ I don’t live in that house anymore, I’m rarely there, and I haven’t called my mother ‘Mommy’ since I was a child.

When I did still live there, though, I would sometimes hear my name. Once, I even heard myself say, ‘Bless you,’ after I sneezed. Sometimes it was just whistling, or me humming.

And it was always in that same, distant voice.

My mom likes to joke about it now, warning any future partners or roommates that they absolutely don’t want to live with me because, in her words, I’m ‘followed’ by something. I’m starting to believe her. Things have happened to me since I was a kid, but I always brushed them off—maybe shared them with a few friends—and moved on.

I don’t think I’ve ever moved on from this encounter, though. And I don’t think I’ll ever escape the sound of my own voice. ",6,1730921752.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

But all I want to say here is be the helper. We must remember **we are never alone**, and as long as we keep those we care about close to us, we can get through all the bad. We always have before. 

So take some time to knock on your neighbor's door, share a cup of coffee with them, and ask them about their favorite childhood book. Go volunteer at a local food packing charity or a shelter to make today and tomorrow better for even just one person. Grab a trash bag and gloves and go pick up trash in your community on a walking trail. Go spend an afternoon in a cat cafe and donate $5 drink money knowing a little one will get some food because of it. Ask your niece or nephew to paint your nails or build a fort, make them feel needed and wanted and loved. Take a long bath with a candle and your favorite book. find family in your faith if you practice. rake an elderly neighbors front lawn or cook them a homemade warm meal.

Do all of these things alone or with loved ones.

Do all of these with love in your heart and remember **you. are. never. alone.** and you **always** have a choice.

The future is terrifying. it is. but be the helper and make yourself and others feel better. there's a lot of hatred and intolerance and cruelty in this world. but there will always, always, always be good. so look for the good, and when you find it, share it. Take every day day by day.

I was just ""diagnosed"" a couple of weeks ago.  I was given a prescription for (generic) Vyvanse... the lowest dosage (20mg I think?).

I'm wondering what it was like for others when you first started using medication.  Was it an immediate (as in, that day) feeling of ""so this is what it feels like for your brain to work normally?""  Or did it take a while of using it consistently?

I'm just not sure how I feel about how I feel when I take it.  I haven't taken it daily since it was prescribed to me; I did at first, but I didn't like how I felt.  So I've been taking it every other or every third day.  I still don't really like the way it makes me feel the day I take it; the day after is when I feel like ""this must be what it's like for my brain to work normally.""  By the third day I'm mostly back to my brain's natural function.

The day that I take it, it makes my brain feel jittery.  And if I'm up moving around, it's much better... but I spend a lot of my day at a desk, doing desk work.

It's possible that I'm winding up over-stimulated between the Vyvanse and my caffeine intake.  But man... I've been waking up, having a cup of coffee, and then having a Monster about an hour later for so so long, that's a HARD habit to break.  Especially because the Monster has always been because I love the taste of the Mango Loco ones; I never felt like they gave me any energy at all.  It's hard to say no to that deliciousness though.

The girl seemed sweet and well spoken from day one. 
At the beginning,we had the usual relationship of people at  work space that get to know eachother . 

As the days progressed my friend (f/30) and the new coworker come closer, and started speaking outside of the working ours. Nothing wrong with that. 
2 weeks ago they went out clubbing with their boyfriends. And after that everything began.
The next day,my friend, in every change she got, was laughing and giggling behind our coworker's back , about how awful she was dancing last night, and that she didn't stop talking even tho they were in a club.I asked her if she had a good time , and the answer i got was ""meh"".
The following days were identical, she kept talking to me about how much she talks, and that she can't keep her mouth shut, but the reality i was seeing was different. My friend was the one that ignited almost all the convos between them during work and also sending her messages, so that I couldn't understand what they were saying. 
So i was thinking "" why the hell does she speak bad about her behind her back even tho they spend almost all day speaking to each other?"",

 But I didn't tell her anything at that point, i waited...
Three days ago, the two of them and another coworker (m,34) were making plans in front of me about where they should go clubbing etc. they didn't ask me if i was interested, in fact they weren't even speaking to me.
Fast forward, today, at the end of our shift, my friend with an excuse that she was sick, asked me to drive her back to her home with my car. As soon as we stepped in my car, she yet again, started telling me how awful it was last night , ""this two didn't stop talking and talking all night, my head was going to blow"" was her exact words, she also called them stupid, and that was the point that i am like"" sorry, sorry, first of all , why do you continue to go out with this people if, as you say, dont have a good time with them, and why do you keep talking 24/7 with them if you think they are stupid?, secondly, why we stopped talking about anything  else than her?"" Was my words. 

After that she looked me and said "" i am very sorry, i thought you were interested in my stories"", and didn't talk to me again during the whole drive way. 
Did i say something wrong? Did i waited to long before telling her? Why she keeps speaking to the coworker if she doesn't like her? Or does she? Why she kept telling me all that? 
All this questions comes to my mind the last few hours, what do you guys think? How should i handle the situation from now on?

Ps, besides casual coffee and cinema,i have never go out with my friend for clubbing, food etc

Ps, with the new coworker, we have a really nice work relationship and that's it, she seems like a nice person, that's why  this whole situation feels weird.",2,1730920799.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

He’s a standup who’s rising to fame

He puts the crowd in a smile and laughs all the while

He still can’t pronounce my full name

I’ve enjoyed all the times that he’s played

And he films all the acts and does so much in fact

Reading poems off a cracked iPhone screen

She’s so wise for her age, like a pubescent sage

Done with life, and she’s only fourteen

Now Claire is a really good vocalist

With a song that she wrote for her ex

And I’m judging him too quick, but he sounds like a real dick

And I wish her more luck with the next

And she’s followed by an outspoken poetess

Who America has once again failed

‘Cause we elected a villain, and I think we should k\*\*\* him

Or at least stick his orange ass in jail.



It’s open mic night at (coffee shop)

And so far it’s all going fine

But there’s still 10 more acts up after me

So I’ll be aware of my time



It’s a pretty good crowd for an open mic

And the barista has seen me before

He says “If ya published a book I would give it a look"" I

Say “Thanks.” And then we don’t talk more

And it’s my turn to share all my stupid poems

And my voice comes out nervous and cracked

And at the end of my jam I’ll plug my Instagram

And if ya follow, I’ll follow you back



Oh la la la di di da

Seriously follow me pleeeeease



It’s open mic night at (coffee shop)

And we’ve all had so much damn fun

But I’m serious: follow my Instagram

I work an 8-4 desk job and it is my first full time job where I am sitting most of the day, working. I gained almost 20 pounds since April which is when I first started the job and I am struggling to go back to the lifestyle I used to live. All my previous jobs were very hands-on and had me actively moving throughout the shift. In addition to that, I was very motivated to go to the gym every day and to cook/eat healthy meals. But ever since I started this job (and don't get me wrong, I am very satisfied with the job itself), I find myself more exhausted than ever after work. The first thing I want to do when I get home from work is just stuff my face with food, scroll on social media, and lie down on my bed. I know in my head that it's unhealthy but my body is just physically so drained and feels sluggish the moment I step inside my home. I just want to crash in my bed but don't want to sleep early or take naps as I just end up sleeping through the entire night and never get anything done. I'm not really an avid coffee drinker either, I'll drink just one cup in the morning on days when I feel extra tired.

It's not like I live like this EVERY single day and I do try my best to get exercise when I can and have been reducing my portion sizes/eating healthier when it comes to meals. Recently, I started getting back into doing cardio 30 mins per day and using a habit tracker to motivate myself to check tasks off. I also have been trying my best to be in bed earlier so I can get at least 7-8 hours of sleep. In my head I know what I should be doing to live out a healthy lifestyle, but my body just doesn't seem to want to listen. Also seeing my body weight not go down has been very discouraging and makes me lose motivation even more. I also feel like time goes by so quickly after work and before I know it I have to go to bed without getting much done.

1gl6hml,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gl6hml/df54_one_month_with_a_mere_mortal/,DF54 One Month with a Mere Mortal,"Hi everybody, I thought I’d share some thoughts and experiences with one month with a DF54.

Some background, my wife (who is a whole human being in her own right) and I are current Barista Express users and have been happy with the machine over the five years we’ve owned it. However, it is a five-year-old machine, and I’ve been keeping an eye out for affordable upgrades. Since we have a built-in grinder with the Express, I decided to first look at getting a second grinder. Doing all the usual research, I settled on the idea of a single-dose workflow grinder, but my wife expressed skepticism, she’s used the Express’s hopper. Well I sit on the idea for a few months while watching the DF54 get released with initial reviews being positive. I was hesitant for a bit after how many changes the DF64 went through, so I thought I’d come back around in a year or so.

Well, suddenly we’re expecting our first child after a three-year delay due to my wife having thyroid cancer. We’re thrilled and terrified. So for the pregnancy, we’re part of a study at a local medical university and in return for participating we each got $75 Amazon gift cards and some free consultations. With the gift card, I decided on some coffee upgrades given the impeding major sleep disruption in the form of an infant. I recalled seeing someone mention MiiCoffee selling the DF54 on Amazon and I thought “Perfect”. 

Background over.

**Build Impressions**

My first observation was how heavy the machine was, this is solid. It’s not often these days that you find all metal builds on products that retail at $230. Breville for instance uses their plastic construction build which saved them costs while they’ve put more into features. The DF54 though, just surprised me with how solid it is. One thing you might not get from the pictures is how small the DF-54 is. If you’ve watched a lot of videos you’ll kind of get the idea that it’s close to the 64 in size, but the machine is quite compact, excellent from smaller spaces. My espresso buddy (let’s call him Karl) came over and also remarked on its compact size.

**User Experience**

One of the few grievances I have with the Express is the grinder. First, the stepped adjustability of the Express’s grinder. It’s not smooth to use, I’ve felt like I have to guess more, and sometimes dialing in new beans would take way too long. The DF54 has been the opposite in my experience, it’s been incredibly easy. The stepless adjustment dial is big and super helpful. Coffee buddy Karl uses a Eureka Specialita and we both talked about how it’s tiny adjustment dial feels outclassed by the large dial on the 54. 

Single dosing has been great. The time grinder of the Express can produce great coffee, but I feel like I’m always guessing on the timer for ground amount and retention bean to bean. Only now with the 54 had I realized how much work the Express grinder has over the years. By contrast, I’ve usually got excellent shots dialed in within one or two shots of waste. I’m not the most discerning and will totally just add more water to a shot that’s close rather than throw it away.

Grinding speed is great for. Some reviews were that it’s slow, but I was correct in guessing that it won’t be something I’d really care about. It’s definitely louder than Karl’s Specialitia, but it’s not bad. 

Side review for single dosing: I splurged on a pack of 10 plastic Weber “Bean Cellars” which are fantastic.  The tubes are incredibly convenient, and I don't miss the hopper of the Express one bit. I went plastic rather than glass because these go on a shelf, and I am clumsy. As someone who has done some product design work, this is some of the best injection molded plastic ever seen, no defects or sharp burs to be found. They’re $4 a tube, but you’re getting a quality product. Also now I can say I have some Weber gear.  
  
**Coffee** 

The coffee from the grinder is awesome, a significant improvement on the Express’s grinder. Every bean that has gone through both the 54 and the Express have shown significant improvement with the 54. I don’t know how to decide everything that is different, but the body and flavor are “richer”. My local coffee shop that I love is all Slayer and Mazzer machines, and I feel like I’m getting as close to that at home as I’ve ever done. The ultimate test was with my wife though. She’s rarely cared about knowing all the things I’m up to with the machine, she likes coffee in a more general way. What does she think? She can tell the difference, and now also use the 54. Trust me, this is a big deal. She mostly doesn’t have an opinion or use any of my various gadgets from over the years, regardless of application (Example, Me: “Look babe, this is in Dolby Vision HDR” Her: “...okay.”). Even she recognizes this as a real improvement. 

**Conclusion**

I think the DF54 is an excellent coffee grinder. I feel confident in it staying an excellent coffee grinder in the long time. It represents probably the highest quality to value in electric grinders. If someone is looking to get into espresso, I find it hard to beat going the DF54 route with a Bambino+ or GCP. It’s actually kind of amazing, the value these days in espresso. Maybe it was the Pandemic that got people really looking at home coffee options differently, but it’s been exciting to watch all of this change over the past few years. As for the next part of my coffee journey, I’m hesitant to replace the Express unless it dies.

I am still in my first 50 shots, but wondering if the cup temperature is ok? It seems a little low to me.

So, I measured the temperature directly after going in the (not preheated) cup. Grinder set to 5 (initial setting of Philips, 5 of 12) and coffee quantity to 3 (of 3). Water temperature is ambient temperature.

Standard temperature setting (2 of 4):

- Espresso:  60,8 °C or ~ 141°F
- Coffee: 72 °C or ~ 161 °F
- Water: 78,2 °C or ~172 °F

Elevated temperature setting (3 of 4):

- Espresso:  72 °C or ~ 161°F
- Coffee: 72 °C or ~ 161 °F (? Same as before)
- Water: 83 °C or ~181 °F

As I am a newbie to superautomatics:
Is this normal? Am I just used to hotter beverages?
Of course preheating the cup is also an option I will do in future.

1gl6cj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gl6cj8/coworker_and_friend_f30_keeps_talking_to_me_about/,"Coworker (and friend, f/30) keeps talking to me about our new coworker (f/27) behind her back...","I (m/29) am kinda confused. First thing first, 1 month ago we welcomed a new member in our office. The girl seemed sweet and well spoken from day one. 
At the beginning,we had the usual relationship of people at  work space that get to know eachother . 

As the days progressed my friend (f/30) and the new coworker come closer, and started speaking outside of the working ours. Nothing wrong with that. 
2 weeks ago they went out clubbing with their boyfriends. And after that everything began.
The next day,my friend, in every change she got, was laughing and giggling behind our coworker's back , about how awful she was dancing last night, and that she didn't stop talking even tho they were in a club.I asked her if she had a good time , and the answer i got was ""meh"".
The following days were identical, she kept talking to me about how much she talks, and that she can't keep her mouth shut, but the reality i was seeing was different. My friend was the one that ignited almost all the convos between them during work and also sending her messages, so that I couldn't understand what they were saying. 
So i was thinking "" why the hell does she speak bad about her behind her back even tho they spend almost all day speaking to each other?"",

 But I didn't tell her anything at that point, i waited...
Three days ago, the two of them and another coworker (m,34) were making plans in front of me about where they should go clubbing etc. they didn't ask me if i was interested, in fact they weren't even speaking to me.
Fast forward, today, at the end of our shift, my friend with an excuse that she was sick, asked me to drive her back to her home with my car. As soon as we stepped in my car, she yet again, started telling me how awful it was last night , ""this two didn't stop talking and talking all night, my head was going to blow"" was her exact words, she also called them stupid, and that was the point that i am like"" sorry, sorry, first of all , why do you continue to go out with this people if, as you say, dont have a good time with them, and why do you keep talking 24/7 with them if you think they are stupid?, secondly, why we stopped talking about anything  else than her?"" Was my words. 

After that she looked me and said "" i am very sorry, i thought you were interested in my stories"", and didn't talk to me again during the whole drive way. 
Did i say something wrong? Did i waited to long before telling her? Why she keeps speaking to the coworker if she doesn't like her? Or does she? Why she kept telling me all that? 
All this questions comes to my mind the last few hours, what do you guys think? How should i handle the situation from now on?

Ps, besides casual coffee and cinema,i have never go out with my friend for clubbing, food etc

1gl62hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gl62hx/torn_on_my_first_espresso_setup_800/,Torn On My First Espresso Setup [<$800],"Hello all! Been lurking in this sub for a bit, and it seems to be a really great group of users! I am located in the US, and upgraded my coffee game a while back from basic drip to nespresso. This only opened my eyes to what I have been missing, not to mention how expensive it is to have a nespresso habit! So I have been trying to decide on what would be my best next step into this world. I just want to be able to make good espresso reliably on a regular basis, maybe have a little room for experimentation, but the base setup needs to be straight forward so that my wife who just wants a cup doesn't get frustrated.

I drink a lot of iced drinks, mostly with milk and a little flavor right now, but would love to dial in the coffee part so that I can dial back the use of those. It doesnt need to be super sweet, just not bitter/burnt tasting like I seem to get from the nespresso. My wife on the other hand likes her drinks hot, usually not very dairy heavy, and prefers larger sizes (She currently uses lungo pods for her morning beverage). For both of us its usually one good beverage in the morning, and occasionally we'll a do a decaf late afternoon or evening.

I have gone back and forth on the hardware selection, and have been convinced that it should be grinder first, then machine in terms of how to get the best shots. For the grinder, It seems like my best bet is going to be the DF54, so it is the brewer that I need some advice on. I think I have it narrowed down to a Bambino Plus, a Barista Pro, Infuser, Legato V2, or the Gaggia Classic Evo. Here are my initial thoughts on each: 

  
Breville units: Seen plenty of posts on how the Bambino is a highly recommended first time machine, however I have found that I can get a certified refurbished pro for just a bit more, and and as far as I can tell even if I dont use the built in grinder and stick with the DF54, the brewing portion of the pro is a decent upgrade over the bambino, let alone just the size/weight/build improvement. I have the infuser in the list because I think that is basically the Pro sans grinder? However, I am not finding certified refurbs of the infuser, so the pro still wins out there on price.

Legato: This one is only known to me because of posts here. I am a bit worried about the untested longevity of the system, but see that so far it has high praise of punching above its weight class. If this is the way to go, I would need help to make sure I am getting the correct version from the correct place and so on.

Gaggia: Know this is sorta the OG and is highly regarded, but seems to require more skill and some upgrades, not to mention boilergate or whatever is going on there. I dont think I would want to have to ""temp surf"", whatever that is, so I think a PID is a necessary upgrade, but have not looked into what that costs and what skill is needed to accomplish. I think this also would void any factory warranty?

  
Thanks in advance for any advice!

[\[Support me of Ko-fi so I can get some character art commissioned ~~and totally not buy a bunch of gundams and toys for my dog~~\]](https://ko-fi.com/theuselessphilosopher)

When testing the capabilities of prototypes for new military equipment, it was generally considered the standard across the Galactic Community Council to make the results public to some degree or another. Though only about ten percent of the roughly two-hundred Ascended species on the galactic stage actively participated in militaristic actions outside of their own borders, nearly every single one had some form of armed services in need of equipment and training. Very few people would have faith in their governments if those governments were unable to provide at least some degree of self-defense without relying on alien contractors or GCC Military Command. Even in situations where intergovernmental treaties obligated one group to protect others as if they were all one people, such as with the Nishnabe Confederacy and their various non-human allies, everyone had at least had their own planetary guard militaries. Because of that, there wasn't a single government who lacked some agency dedicated to keeping up with the latest developments and innovations involving military technologies.

Considering how expensive the process of creating, testing, and licensing combat systems really was, very few producers could afford to not market and attempt to sell every single of their designs to a diverse array of species and governments. The Nishnabe Confederacy's Industrial Zone 14, despite its relatively small size in comparison to other major producers, had quite few weapons and systems that were popular enough to bring in some revenue. However, where most other firms would try to sell anything and everything they created to anyone and everyone, Zone 14 kept particularly sensitive technologies off the galactic market. Though their powered exo-armor, the vast majority of their weapons systems, and even the BD-series were sold abroad in some form or another, certain things were simply never mentioned. The stealth field technology they had developed, for example, was deemed by themselves, Military Command, and even the Singularity Collective as being too sensitive to be available for anyone else to possess.

It had been around ten minutes since the initial test run of the latest BD-series mech had concluded and Tens found himself seated on the ground a few paces away from the behemoth. The BD-10-X-1, a ten meter tall combat walker shaped like a human wearing head to toe armor, was unlike anything the Nishnabe warrior had ever experienced. That machine was something else, even compared to his Martian friend’s customized and dramatically overpowered BD-9s. Between the more human-like proportions, seventy tons of omnidirectional thrust, and segmented protective paneling, it actually frightened him. Tens really should have been used to that kind of power. He had spent countless hours in the cockpit and virtualized control environment of a BD, been there every step of the way during the BD-series's over a decade and half of development, and even built the very first prototype way back when he was just seventeen years old. However, there was something different, something that genuinely terrified him, about this new design. For once in his life, Tens believed he found a mech that was simply too powerful, too capable, and simply too much to actually use in combat, let alone make available on the galactic market for military equipment.

“Is there something wrong, my love?” Atxika asked as she approached Tens. “You didn't hurt yourself during testing, did you?”

“No… It's just…” Tens had to exert a real and earnest effort to pull his eyes from the war machine he had just been testing for the past few hours. When his eyes met Atxika's, he could see a genuine worry in those crimson red, almond-shaped orbs, prompting him to fake a smile. “I'm fine, beautiful. I'm just thinking about that new mech and its capabilities.”

“Oh yes…” The blue, amazonian Admiral plopped herself down on the ground next to her lover and placed a loving arm around him. “I was reviewing the data from your test runs with Frimp and the other engineers and… Well… Let's just say I am quite impressed. Even if the licensing and production cost was an eye watering thirty million credits as is estimated, I believe every single Matriarchy would want some. In fact, I could even see other species making requests to have the cockpit design modified for their morphology. Maybe not Nukatovs, but Kikitau, Jiroxets, and maybe even Kyim’ayik. By just adding another layer of inertial dampers, I would be willing to bet that even species with only mid-level acceleration tolerances would want some in their military. You should feel proud of what your initial design has become with the help of your newly Ascended kin!”

“Yeah… That's what I'm worried about…” Atxika could feel Tens shudder at the thought of BD-10s on a battlefield. “That mech is just… It scares me…”

“It scares you?!?” The massive woman didn't take her arm off from around her lover but did have a surprised inflection in her voice. “I don't think I've heard you say something like that before.”

“I've never operated something like this before.” Tens allowed his eyes to wander back to the monstrous machine, motioned towards it with his hand, then slowly brought his gaze back while taking a deep breath. “Atx, that mech could start a galactic scale arms race. Anyone who couldn't field something like it won't be able to take one out. And anyone that deploys a full squad of them… There won't be anything their enemy could do to defend themselves. If BD-9s are machines made for war, that BD-10 is pure combat dominance distilled to its purest form. I'm afraid of what would happen if one of these fell into the wrong hands.”

“Then we will need to ensure that never happens, Tens.” Atxika simply smiled and placed a gentle kiss on her man’s forehead before pressing his head into her chest. “If you are feeling this way, my love, then I am sure both Maser and NAN are already making preparations. A BD cannot function without a control AI. Even if nefarious parties were able to get their hands on a physical example, or possibly even produce one of their own, they would never be able to use it without Maser or another equally powerful AI giving them access to quasi-sentient AIs.”

“Mmm mhm.” The vibrations caused by Tens attempting to speak despite his face being buried in his lover’s bosom caused Atxika to let out a sharp giggle as she released the pressure from his head, allowing him to both breath and speak clearly. “You’re right, my love. If anyone can stop this type of machine from starting wars, then it’ll be Maser and NAN.”

/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Bonjour, Maser. I have not seen you at one of our meetings in quite some time.” General Renee Descarte was the first to enter the UHDF Council chamber for the day’s meeting and was surprised to see the holographic representation of the Light-born AI already seated at the round table. “Has something come in Sol that demands our attention?”

“Good morning, Renee. And, no. Nothing to report regarding Sol. This has to do with…” The androgynous hologram had a quite serious expression on its almost perfectly human face. “We should probably wait until the rest of the Council arrives to discuss this. In the meantime, may I ask how you are enjoying here on Shkegpewen? I suspect it is quite different from where you are from.”

“Ooo… This is a wonderful place, full of beauty, innovation, and peace. I envy this world the Nishnabe have built for themselves.” There was still nearly forty-five minutes before this meeting was scheduled to start but General Descartes had arrived early in order to spend some time alone, away from her advisors and colleagues, in order to simply sip some coffee and read the news from her home country of France. However, the opportunity to speak with Maser alone came up so rarely that she was more than happy to spend the next few minutes before any other Council members arrived chatting with the surprisingly human but also clearly alien Artificial Sapience. “When I first heard that there were humans already living on an extraSolar world, alongside aliens, and with technologies I could only dream of, my imagination ran wild with the possibilities of what could be. Now that I am here and have seen it with my own eyes, I must admit, it feels like a dream. Part of me still believes that I will wake up soon back in Paris and have to go back to my old duties at the UN-E Security Council.”

“I can assure you that you are not dreaming.” Maser couldn't help but smile at the Frenchwoman as she walked over to a refreshment stable to make herself a cup of coffee. “But I very much know how you feel. I have been conscious for two hundred and fifty-seven million years and the past thousand I have spent with the Nishnabe have been… As you said, full of beauty, innovation, and peace. They have become my family more than any other beings I have ever known. I have been with them since their second generation born on this world and am continually amazed by their accomplishments. I believe humanity in Sol could learn a lot from them.”

“I am sure we could.” Renee didn’t want to sound too dismissive, but in her mind the history of the Nishnabe from that of Earth for the lessons learned by either to really be applicable to the other. From governmental systems to military doctrine and all of the smaller, much more subtle differences that made these humans already living among the stars unique from even their closest cultural relatives in Sol, the French General was stuck on the differences as opposed to the similarities. “Between medical, environmental, and resource extraction technologies, I suspect that life on both Earth and Mars will change for the better for everyone. I am very much looking forward to seeing what the city lights of Paris will look like in twenty years.”

“Nishnabe medicine comes from Penidon technology. Their ability to manipulate the natural environment was taught to them by Kyim’ayik. Much of their mineral extraction, resource harvesting, and even some of their architectural design was introduced by Hi-Koths.” Maser freely admitting to all of that put a somewhat confused expression on Renee’s face as she took her cup of coffee from the machine and walked over to her seat. “While NAN and I mostly chose not to directly interfere with the Nishnabe’s choices nor to seek to influence them in any particular way, there have been other species here since day one. One hundred and fifty humans, twenty Kyim’ayik, and a dozen Hi-Koth settled together and founded Shkegpewen, A New Place to Land Boats, or simply Newport. They had access to galactic standard technologies from the very beginning simply as a means of accommodating the non-humans. Two hundred years later, after the number of humans had grown to over a thousand, many Kyim’ayik and Hi-Koth coming and going, and the first locally produced galactic-standard space station was produced, a group of Penidons came and never left. Their descendants still live here as more come every so often. Now, there are over a dozen different species living alongside each here as if they were all one people with a culture and heritage. As I researched more into the diverse history of the rest of humanity, I found similar patterns across Earth for nearly all of your recorded history. If the modern day people and governments of Sol learned to embrace that aspect of your species more fully the way the Nishnabe and their Confederacy have, I believe that the city you were born into will be completely unrecognizable in twenty years. And I mean that in the best possible way, of course.”

“I hope you are right.” General Descartes paused for a moment to take a deep sip of still steaming and pitch black beverage. “But I suspect it will take more than twenty years for all of the different people on Earth to live together as harmoniously as people do here. The differences between UN-E and MarsGov are even more vast. Perhaps in fifty years. Maybe a hundred. But that may just be wishful thinking.”

“What do yah mean yah think we need to reconsider how we plan on usin’ these mechs?!?” Commandant Carol Nez was initially glad to have the test pilot of the new BD-10 prototype but found herself irritated once Tens started to give the second half his report. “I thought yah said it was the greatest and most capable piece of military equipment yah'd ever used!”

“That's the problem.” Though Tens had stood before similar councils before and knew how to carry himself, he had usually been on the side in support of production and deployment of mechs. “It's too capable. Just one of those BD-10s could take on an entire army and likely come out on top.”

“And we would be fools not to have that kind of strength if we have it at our fingertips!” General Robert Andrews added with a gusto. Though he and Admirals Akira Tanaka both took Tens's comparison of the BD-10 prototype to an atomic weapon quite seriously, neither were ready to pass up the opportunity to have such weapons in their arsenal. “The more power our military force, the more lives we can save!”

“Tens, we already have three planet-crackers.” War Chief Neshkaname attempted to put his fellow Nishnabe warrior at ease with a half-chuckling reply. Considering he wasn't a member of Tens's clan, hadn't spent anywhere near as much time with him, and only came around to the idea of utilizing BDs in Blue Fleet a few years after they had deployed in Red Fleet, he couldn't understand why the man seemed almost pessimistic about the latest prototype. “Even if we had thousands of these new mechs in service, their capabilities would pale in comparison to the rest of our fleets.”

“A squad of five BD-10s, if equipped with weapons scaled up for their increased size, along with a squad of ten of Mik's custom mechs, could take out one of our planet crackers.”

After Tens made that comment, the Council chamber fell silent. Everyone present was at least vaguely aware of the void combat capabilities of BD-series mech with the appropriate reentry pack configuration. Though the number of fighter-interceptors still vastly overshadowed the number of BDs currently in use in either of the Nishnabe Militia’s fleets, that had far more to do with cost efficiency and mission-specific design as opposed to actual combat efficacy. They were aware that a properly equipped BD-series mech in the hands of a competent operator could be just as deadly as any purpose-built void craft. However, the suggestion that a small group of the new BD-10s, let alone any war machine, could take on a several kilometer long vessel with weapons systems able to tear the crust from a planet would be almost laughable. So much so that almost every person present in the room was now looking at Tens with disbelief written across their faces.

“That can’t possibly-” Just as Nesh was about to scold the man he considered to be an out of line warrior, Maser cut him off with a gentle but unimpeachable tone.

“Tens is right.” While hearing from a thirty-three year old mech operator who had spent almost half of his life in that role carried some weight, having a two-hundred and fifty million years old AI back him up was something else entirely. “Those new combat walkers will change warfare in this galaxy. As you will all see in the initial report concerning the BD-10-X-1 prototype, Tens was only able to reach half of the acceleration needed to trigger the limiters. Even the highest performance fight-interceptors in our inventory would struggle to match those capabilities. Couple that with the ability to board certain vessel types, particularly the larger ones such as line ships or planet-crackers, and they will be just as much of a menace in the void as they would be on the ground. And remember, no one here is opposed to producing and fielding these new mechs. But I do agree that this Council should very much consider how we move forwards on that subject.”

Once again, the Council chamber fell silent. However, instead of dismissive or irritated expressions, the majority of UHDF Council members now had contemplative expressions. While Tens was just one man, as experienced and knowledgeable as he was, the opinion of a being who predated mammalian life on Earth brought real and undeniable merit to his argument. After all, he hadn’t proposed that the Council entirely scrap the BD-10 project. Rather, the second half of the report he gave went into detail about the various ways that humanity should seek to rein in the destructive potential of these new mechs. Limited production runs, extremely specific licensing contracts that could only be given out to a select few trusted allies, and an under-reporting of the machines’ capabilities to GCC Military Command were just a few but none had sat quite right with most Council members. If they had the funds, wanted to get back some of the production costs, and have a mutually respectful relationship with the galactic community, then none of those proposals could be implemented. However, with Maser clearly sympathetic to and in support of Tens on this issue, everyone present had to put real thought into it.

“A’right Tens…” Despite normally staying quiet during these overtly militaristic meetings, Mik understood his role as a voice of reason from an anti-war perspective. “I think yah an’ Maser make some good points. As much as I wanna see giant mech battles, handin’ out licenses for these mechs like their candy ain’t soundin’ like such a good idea no more. An’ maybe MC don’t need to know what these can do, if y’all know what I’m sayin’. Pull the ol’ school ‘Muricah technique o’ undersellin’ everythin’ but always still walkin’ ‘round with the biggest stick.

Anyway there is this guy that is also a regular; I see him at least once a week. He always gets the same coffee, he always has his AirPods in and usually looks like he just finished a run. I never see him take in the surroundings too much as he’s usually listening to music or something or he stares at the floor.. so he probably doesn’t know I’m a regular too. 

Anyway around 2 months of seeing him around I started paying attention to him, and well I think he’s pretty cute. It’s been 3 months and I was thinking of asking him out but I’m scared to come off as weird for talking to a stranger, anyway if anyone has similar experiences and advice on how you dealt with this stage please tell me.

Yeah it's me again. The, uh, ""karma farmer."" First, I've got a lot of explaining to do.

My head's a little clearer now, the shock is gone but I still have the image of her on the bathroom floor burned into my mind.

A lot of you probably hate me for how I reacted the other day and I'm sorry. I was being an ass. Maybe irredeemably, but I'll try again anyway.

Folks called me out for posting so quickly, to which I say, yeah, that was fast. I write fast, and I felt like venting on venting subs because maybe that's one of my (maladaptive?) coping skills and also that's what the sub is for. Yes, I wanted attention while I was suffering, is that wrong? And I made it about me, because I was hurting and Shawnda can't hurt anymore. I can't show her your responses, and I'm kind of glad for that.

A lot of people said it was fake, it didn't happen, I made it all up, ""Clearly written by ChatGPT"" (I'll now take that as a compliment to my writing skills). Well, that drove me kind of crazy, and I started to say I did it, too.

But to some extent, I wasn't entirely honest about all the details of her death and how we found her. I said ""we"" broke down the door, but the truth is I wasn't there when it was broken down, I just wished I was, and I wish I had done it earlier. I was upstairs in my room, and the only reason I came down is because I heard the commotion downstairs. Very loud banging on a door, people yelling. I thought a fight had broken out. It's a house of 12, we're all poor here, and mostly low-lifes in some way so it happens, although it is surprisingly rare. That's why I was recording when I came down the stairs, in case something needed to be reported. And if the doubters get to me bad enough, I might even break down and post it, as soon as I find the strength to edit out the graphic bit.

And I am a creative writer. But I base everything serious that I write on facts. I can't help but end things with one-liners, puns or things like that, I just like them.

Anyway. I don't think I *really* know how to write a eulogy, because I've never done it before, but I'll try.

#**LaShawnda Walker**

That was her name. We just called her Shawnda. She was older, my guess, 45 to 55. She never did share her age, nor her birthday, even when we asked.

She moved into this house about 2 years ago, and I saw her after I walked down the stairs and saw the front door left wide open. At first I thought she was one of the homeless people that would occasionally dig through our garbage. My first words to her were, ""Are you... supposed to be here?""

She looked at me funny, of course, and said ""Hell yeah, I live here now. Are you supposed to be here?""

We didn't really start to get along until the second week, but I came to know her as being a very funny character, mostly in the way she reacted and made expressions. Sometimes she'd catch us doing things that looked strange, she'd always give this funny look and say, ""Uh-uh,"" shaking her head with a slight grin.

There was one time I caught her staring very intently at my other roommate, who was bent over digging in the fridge. I stopped, and we both stood there silently for a minute, Shawnda continuing to stare and me standing with my arms folded, mentally tapping my toe, eyebrow raised at her, until she finally noticed me and burst out laughing.

I never did let her live that one down. Shawnda later explained to me that she was trying to read her tramp stamp (""Slippery when wet""). I still teased her about it. It even came up again last month, but she did finally get her revenge as she caught me checking my *other* other roommate out.

Shawnda always had stories to tell. She would talk about her houses or her cars or her people she's got out of state. I think she just liked to tell tall tales (ooh, talliteration), maybe trying to one-up me whenever I'd made some sort of progress, but it was interesting listening to her anyway.

She did most of the housework here, towards the end. This house is probably on its way downhill now that she's gone. I don't think anyone else is doing chores, they're too busy smoking and sleeping, or sleeping around, or probably shoplifting somewhere. We're not a very well-adjusted household, everyone here is either mentally ill, physically disabled, a drug addict, a criminal, very elderly, or some combination thereof. I like to think I'm the ""only sane [wo]man,"" but I'm up there, too. And I'm always out, busy working or running errands or just trying to escape from this place.

***Shawnda.*** This is Emily. I am sad to say I don't know if you have any family, but I want you to know that you will be missed. Since you've been gone, I can't seem to help but find things I've wanted to show you. I'm learning more and more about maintaining my car, I just replaced Judy's front motor mount (twice, in three days) and it was a huge PITA both times. I must have spent an hour and a half running into and out of O-Reilly's back and forth just to return and buy different types of bolts. I don't think I'll be able to get to the rear mount without a real mechanic, but I might be able to do the passenger side and transmission mount soon. I want her to be the smoothest running AE92 in the city, maybe county. You probably wouldn't really care, but you'd normally listen to me say it anyway. Then you'd probably say something about that clean-as-hell 1950s truck that you say you used to work on, but had to give up to the neighbor who drives it by every so often now.

I hope you're having fun talking to all those ghosts you said you'd heard around the house, finding out what they're *really* up to. I guess if that's where you are, at least you won't be all alone.

I haven't talked to Tyia since that day, but I'm sure she misses you a lot too. She broke down immediately when we realized you were gone.

Terri heard the news, too. I called her that day. She said she never even got to say goodbye to you before she left. Everybody who knew you here is a little broken up now, well, I don't know about Sharon. All she seems to care about is the paint she accidentally stripped off her new coffee table. But maybe she's hurting too, trying to distract herself. Even Tim said it doesn't feel right here without you. We all loved you, Shawnda. Rest in peace.

Getting referrals is pretty difficult, especially if you don't know anyone personally working in a company that you want to be a part of. I had the same issue while looking for jobs this year and cold applying led to ""Unfortunately, we are proceeding with other candidates"" emails (which can be pretty frustrating).

Using this approach and referral message, I was able to get more interviews and luckily also land an offer at a big tech company. While referrals don't guarantee an interview, it helps increase the chances of getting your application viewed over the 1000+ applications received on a single job posting.   
  
This approach was far more effective than just cold applying and helped me also directly connect with the hiring team and recruiters. Not all referrals led to an interview, only about 70% of them did and I was able to get the ""Next steps"" and the ""Unfortunately"" emails much more quicker than I would than cold applying.

Approach:

1. Connect with a bunch of engineers from a certain company, from interns to senior level engineers.  
  
2. Out of those who accepted my connection request, send them this message to show what I have experience with and try getting a referral.  
  
3. Wait about 2 days for a reply, if no reply, just cold apply.  
  
4. If they reply after a few days or after getting their referral, I ask them if they know who the recruiter or the hiring team is to boost my chances and connect with the team directly

Message template: 

\-------

Hi <Name>,  
  
It's great connecting with you and I hope you're doing well!  
  
I'm \_\_, a recent Computer Science graduate from the \_\_ and a former software engineer intern from \_\_, where I was part of the \_\_ team working on…. <talk about your main experience here, impact and what you’ve worked on>  
  
I'm currently seeking new grad / entry level roles and I came across this <role name> opportunity at <Company name> , and wanted to reach out to you to see if I could get your referral for the exciting opportunity as I believe I'd be a great fit for the role!.  
  
I've attached my resume below on this message for your reference (my personal website: <portfolio website link if you have one>). If you think I'd be a good fit, I'd love to get your referral and hopefully a connection with the team hiring (if you'd know) for that role!  
  
Thanks a lot <Name> and I hope you have a great day ahead!

\---------

Additionally, even when there would be no job postings from a company I was interested in, I'd still send connection requests to senior level engineers and ask them for a quick coffee chat to discuss my experience, interests and also to get advice on my resume (I was able to connect with engineers from Microsoft, Meta, Artic Wolf, Coinbase and much more). This helped a ton to create that authentic connection and also get a strong referrals as soon as positions opened up, which was far more easier and effective to get a referral. 

Yet again, referrals doesn't guarantee an interview, but puts your application on top of the pile :)  
  
I hope this helps those looking for jobs atm. Good luck guys!",3,1730918671.0,csMajors,2,1.0,False

*Low tone chime*

***Captain Janeway, Viceroy of the Delta Quadrant:*** Come! Oh Lieutenant, how goes your investigation?

***Starfleet Security Lieutenant Columbo:*** *Good evening Captain. Hello Doctor. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about Ma'am. Just one, or two questions have come up about the* sabotage *on Deck 15.* 

**The Legend, the Doctor:** Sabotage? I thought the Briefing said the explosion was an accident.

**Columbo:** Ah yes Sir, that was the verdict of Ship's Security after their initial investigation. But there can be doubt. The pattern of the explosions targeted very specific segments of the Computer Core. This was deliberate.

**Janeway:** You're saying that someone, or something took out parts of our Sensor logs?

**Columbo:** Yes Captain. That is what they tried to do.

**The Doctor:** Tried? You mean they failed?

**Columbo:** Yes Doctor. Whoever it was didn't know that Engineering was running a surprise Auxiliary systems drill at the time. Thus initiating a Main Computer boot up in Main Engineering. 

**Janeway:** Meaning?

**The Doctor:** Meaning the primary systems and code and all operations were running on a separate system in Engineering at the time and would have transferred back to the main Core afterward. Quite simple really, just like reinitialising my Mobile transmitter.

**Columbo:** Quite so Doctor. You know Miss. Wildman said you're quite the genius. Not just a Doctor, but a real Thinker. 

**Doctor:** Why thank you Lieutenant, you know I've always seen myself as something of a...

**Janeway:** I believe you had some questions Lieutenant.

**Columbo:** Ah yes ma'am. Where was I? \[*Sees a rare gemstone next to a first Edition hardcover book on the desk\]* Say, is that... well this very valuable isn't it? Gee I've never seen a real antique like that before. 

**Janeway:** A family heirloom. You were saying?

**Columbo:** Yes Captain. I was saying there are just a couple of things that have popped up. Since whoever it was, was trying to remove data logs from within the specific cores in question. Astrometrics, General Supplies along with the Armoury have confirmed that a considerable proportion of their logs and their logs alone would have been wiped out. So whoever the culprit was, wanted those logs gone. 

**The Doctor:** Very logical.

**Columbo:** I thought so too sir. So I went through those specific entries and let's just say there's a lot to sort through. Several years worth! I had the whole next few nights booked out just to do it. But you know something funny? Something immediately came up just minutes after I started. Coffee.

**Janeway:** Oh I'm terribly sorry Lieutenant, would you care for some?

**Columbo:** I'm fine ma'am, no I meant Coffee. The Cargo Bay logs showed what Voyager left Spacedock and Deep Space Nine with. And... well it's a little delicate Captain, but your name does show up on the Manifest. *I just wondered why when we have ample Replicators aboard, and the mission schedule was for around two months, why you’d bring in so many stocks of Coffee for the Stores. Cargo Bay 5 was full of it.* According to Mr. Neelix, er he's been very helpful, he did a thorough inventory *of* Cargo Bay 4 and 7 and confirmed some of the original stocks are still present and accounted for.

***Janeway***: Is that all it was? Oh that's easy to answer. Well I grew up with the maxim that you can never have too much Coffee. Besides, Captain’s prerogative and sometimes the Replicator just doesn’t do the aroma justice.

***Columbo***: Well that would explain that I guess. Makes sense... Stores did show Caviar, Coffee, Ceylon Tea, Italilan Cheese, I can definitely see why those who like their authentic food might keep some stored for special occasions, but the quantities are quite something. Quite a list… and when it comes to the Armoury...Gee that's funny.

***Janeway***: I beg your pardon?

***Columbo***: It's just, well.. and I confirmed this with Security Chief Tuvok as well... but Tricobalt devices weren't standard issue. And Crewman Elena mentioned that you personally requested these devices before we left Deep Space Nine.

***Janeway***: Voyager was one of Starfleet's latest prototypes. We were outfitted with many ground breaking new technologies. I thought that weapons be no exception.

***Columbo***: But that's just the thing Ma'am. You specifically requested *Tricobalt* torpedoes, but not Quantum torpedoes. In fact, you\* openly *declined the latter from Starfleet. Here, I know I wrote it down somewhere...where's that* data pad... Gee my wife is always telling me to have a separate pocket for it, I'm always losing it, ah here it is yes.... *Security logs, Captain Janeway requests Tricobalt torpedoes. Why not Quantum torpedoes?*

***Janeway***: We were off on a rather routine mission Columbo. Quantum torpedoes are rather serious Starfleet weapons. Lieutenant, I know you're just doing your job. But I do have a ship to run. Is there a point to all this?

***Columbo***: It's just when People do something different, my mind just asks questions and well to be truthful Captain, it's my boss, Tuvok. He's very thorough. He won't settle for anything missing from a Report and you'd be doing me a tremendous *favour if you could just clear one, or two things up.*

***Janeway***: I thought I did.

***Columbo***: See, Tuvok tells me that when Quantum torpedoes are put onto Federation Starships, there has to be an official log on the Fleet's roster. Advanced intellectual property. But, it's not just the torpedoes Captain. No.. you see Seven of Nine, ah that's Miss. Hansen, you know the lady in your lab who...

***Janeway***: I know who she is Lieutenant.

***Columbo***: Ah yes ma'am. Well, she discovered data that the weapons you specifically requested caused a breakdown in... something called a..can't read my own hand writing.. ah yes.. a ""subspace rupture"" and that quote - a blue beam was detected by the ship's logs carrying away the Caretaker Array - end quote.

***Janeway***: That could have been anything Lieutenant.

***Columbo***: That's just the thing Ma'am. See did you also *know that she and your Chief Engineer have concluded that the blue beam of that particular frequency could only come from a Starfleet ship. And as I understand* it, we *are the only Starfleet ship in the quadrant. I've also had the data* analysed *by our lab, and they've confirmed that.. let me see quote - the blue beam's origin can be in no doubt, originated from USS Voyager...* The *spectral analysis matches the Deflector dish from this ship. There's no other possible ship in the Galaxy that that beam could come from. So you* see *my point ma'am and my conundrum. How can the Voyager be detecting a blue beam coming from the Voyager? How could the ship be in two places at once?*

***Janeway***: I'm afraid you have me stumped.

**Columbo:** You're not the only one Ma'am. There's also the Doctor's Emitter.

**The Doctor:** My emitter?

**Columbo:** Yes Doctor. A truly marvellous piece of technology. See that spectral analysis I mentioned, well, the lady from the lab also helped me scan for that and well, isn't it funny, but the signature matches the signatures of the material in your Emitter.

**The Doctor:** What does that mean?

**Janeway:** That your emitter originates from the same vessel that the Lieutenant's blue beam came from. 

**Columbo:** Exactly right ma'am. I thought you would understand. So you see Captain, the Doctor's emitter definitely is advanced, but it's not from the future. No ma'am it's from this ship. It's been on this ship the whole time. A contingency for the future. 

**The Doctor:** That's incredible. You're saying that someone was planning for the ship to be in the Delta Quadrant.

**Columbo:** It certainly looks that way Doctor.

\[Sickbay to the Doctor. We have two patients who require your Assistance. Both just ate the Dish of the Day from the Mess Hall\]

**The Doctor:** As always, I wish my suggestions to screen our Morale officer's special menu would be taken seriously. Excuse me Captain. Lieutenant. \[Exits\]

**Janeway:** You certainly seem to be uncovering many mysteries, or many coincidences Lieutenant, though I can't say quite what they all amount to.

***Columbo***: Isn't it all something? I tell you, this case is one of the strangest cases I've had in a long time. But don't you worry. I'll get to the bottom of it. You know me, I just keep digging until I find the answers. A bit like computer coding. I understand you were top in your class at the Academy. Anyway, here I am going on about Coffee and Beams, whilst yours is getting cold. I'll let you get back to your Coffee.

*\[Approaching the exit\]*

***Columbo***: Oh there's just one more thing Captain.

***Janeway***: (*Sighs*) Be brief, Lieutenant.

***Columbo***: It's my understanding that Tom Paris was released from StarFleet custody in order to help track down the Maquis ship. 

**Janeway:** You're not suggesting Mr. Paris is responsible for the explosions?

**Columbo:** Oh no Ma'am. He had no motive. And he was with about 50 or so others in the Observation Deck at the time. Just trying to verify something. It was you who *personally requested his transfer, is that correct?*

***Janeway***: That's public knowledge Lieutenant.

***Columbo***: Yes Captain. It's just... here \[showing data pad\]. You can see the official transfer order here. Paris was chosen because of his knowledge of the area.

**Janeway:** That's correct.

**Columbo:** Well see that's the thing Ma'am. According to the Stardate, you requested his transfer formally 5 months ***before*** *the Macquis ship even entered the Badlands. I checked with Commander Chakotay ma’am. He was a little reluctant to tell me and said I was barking up the wrong tree. I understand the two of you are very close…but... yes here it is, he confirmed that their ship was nowhere near the Badlands until that Stardate. And Commander Tuvok, who was an undercover operative at the time, confirmed the same thing. So you* see how some might question, how did you know you'd need a navigator for the Badlands before you knew where you would be sent?

*\[Dramatic music\]*

*LATER in the Mess Hall*

**Janeway:** \[enters\] Mr. Neelix, I could really use some of that Rylothian Blend.

**Neelix:** Of course Captain. I take it your Coffee is still official evidence until further notice?

**Janeway:** Hopefully not for too long... I

**Crewman Mitchell and another Security officer:** Captain, the Senior staff have requested your presence in the Conference room.

**Janeway:** Excuse me?

**Crewman Mitchell:** Please, ma'am. I'm just following orders.

**Janeway:** Then, lead the way.

...

*LATER in the Conference Room*

**Janeway**: \[Enters\] What's going on? \[Looking at Columbo\]

\[Commander Chakotay, Tuvok, the Doctor, Seven of Nine, Kim, Torres, Paris are seated with another 7 Starfleet crew seated at one end of the table. 3 security officers stand at the doorway. Lieutenant Columbo is standing near the Captain's chair\]

**Columbo:** I'm afraid there's some unanswered questions ma'am.

**Janeway:** You're reaching at straws Lieutenant. When I assigned you to this investigation, you were meant to investigate the explosions, not go on a wild goose chase to goodness knows where. And how could you go along with this madness? \[Looking at Chakotay and Tuvok\]

**Tuvok:** Captain, this is an Independent Board of Inquiry. I too shared your doubts as to the logic of the Lieutenant's enquiries. However, the various pieces of evidence alongside Seven's discoveries in our own Logs... logs which were targeted in the sabotage. Ship's security and Logic dictates we must look into it. 

\[Janeway sits at the Captain's chair\]

**Commander Chakotay:** Kathryn, I told the Lieutenant that there has to be an explanation. I didn't want to go along with this, but when we started out here we promised we'd stick to the principles of the Federation. Starfleet protocols have to be followed. And there are things that just don't make sense. I can't explain them! Help me believe that there isn't some sort of conspiracy going on here!

**Janeway:** Stocks of Coffee?

**Columbo:** The Tricobalt torpedoes.

**Seven of Nine:** And the blue beam.

**Ensign Kim:** Are we really suggesting that there was a conspiracy to bring us all here, to the Delta Quadrant, that the Captain knew about this, and it was us who stole the Caretaker's reactor? And we have no knowledge of any of this?

**Seven:** We may not have stolen it yet Ensign.

**Paris:** You're saying we're going to? In the future? But how can that be, the Logs are from the past!!

**Janeway:** You don't know what you're doing Lieutenant. See what you've done. You've got my crew fighting each other! All of you. I can't tell you what's going on, nor why I can't tell you right now, but one day you will understand. This enquiry is over. \[Gets up\]

**Crewmen:** Captain, this is an independent Board. You have no jurisdiction here. 

**Janeway:** This is a witch hunt. And I will not have it aboard my ship.

\[Chakotay and Tuvok exchange glances\]

**Tuvok:** Sergeant of the Guard, restrain the Captain and return her to the Witness chair.

\[Security officers step into her path\]

**Janeway:** Your orders are to escort Lieutenant Columbo to his quarters and confine him there until further notice.

**Columbo:** Before you do that Captain, there's just one more thing Ma'am. See I checked the Pathfinder Voyager communication logs. The communication correspondence with former Admiral Pressman's office was verified.

**Janeway:** Former?

**Columbo:** Yes Ma'am. I know you were just following orders. The Admiral was removed from command by Captain Picard following an incident on the Enterprise. After the discovery of an off the books Phased Cloaking device. He was taken into custody by the Judicial Department.

**Torres:** A phased cloak? 

**Seven:** The blue beam...

I've been trying to find the most cost effective way to start this game in terms of collecting miniatures. So far, I really think the best way to get started is to get a box of Perry Miniatures War of the Roses Foot Knights 1450-1500 and a box of WW1 soldiers from Wargames Atlantic with your preference in flavor from Germans, French, British, or Russians. This should run under $75 for both boxes depending on where you get them and shipping.

The Perry box comes with bits to build 38 minis with leftover bits, which is more than enough to combine with the 30 minis from the WW1 Wargames Atlantic box of choice. This should be enough to get roughly 2 warbands on the table. You can get creative with bits to make Faithful or Heretic warbands. My preference is to get creative and kitbash, as for \~$90 you could instead get two 700 ducat warbands from the Kickstarter.

**As for terrain**, mine will be nearly free by using cardboard from Amazon boxes and trying to make different shaped boxes that nest inside each other for storage. The boxes will be turned upside-down and painted on top with textured paint or sand+paint+glue with the sides boarded up with things like coffee stirrers and corrugated cardboard to make them look like trenches.

How are you planning on getting started with this game? How would you recommend people starting from scratch? What are some great deals to get started that folks may not have considered? Thanks!",1,1730917897.0,TrenchCrusade,0,0.67,False

Last year 2023 Sep she backed for one month, I went on a biz trip in city A and she also visited her cousin brother in City A, so we hang out a bit(I ddin't have too much time due to work), I treated them meal (include her and his cousin).

After one week we both backed to City B, this is the city we spent childhood, she invited our childhood friend and his wife, I treated them four dinner. Which is okay because I earned more moner than our childhood friend, also he is pretty generous to me in the past. But when I was about to pay, she said loudly 'shouldn't the guy pay the dinner bill?' in front of his wife, which made me feel embarrased, I had first fight with her after the dinner, I called her selfish and inconsiderate.

This year 2024 June she back again, stay three months, so I treated her and her cousin brother dinner, paid for taxi, coffee, hotel.  She didn't even offered to BUY ME A BOTTLE OF WATER. I lost my temper and screamed at her, she cried.

After she traved back to the country she lived, she keep texting me and calling me, at first I replied some simple words, then one day I was in very bad mood ( I am very stressful with job hunting recently), she keep calling me, I just didn't pick up and messaged her I don't wanna chat, if she keep calling I will block her, I even used words like ’if my frd did the things you did to me, I already blocked them five times).

SO we didn't talk since then, like two weeks. I felt really sad actually, 20 years friendship is not easy but I really can't stand a frd like this in my life anymore. Selfish, inconsiderate, immature, take my kindness as granted. :(

I felt so hurt, welcome to similar experience sharing and comment. have a nice day&thanks for reading my post.

Feel free to direct message me if you need help.



Day 1: Arriving in the Capital



Arrive in Santo Domingo and head to your hotel. If you arrive early enough, you can explore the city. In the night, check out the nightlife.



Day 2: The Country’s Next Big Destination



You are to make a daytrip today. Wear swimming attire and water shoes. Also, bring a towel as well as a meal box so you can have breakfast while on the road. Firstly, you are to be taken via a 4-hour drive to a beach called Playa Galeras. There you are to take a 30-minute boat ride to another beach called Playa Fronton. There you have around 30 minutes to go swimming. You should be back at Playa Galeras around 12:00pm. At this time, we recommend you purchase lunch at the restaurant there. After your meal, you are to be taken via a 30-minute drive to Playa Rincon. There you have around 30 minutes to swim and relax. Next, you are to be taken via a 1.5-hour drive to a natural site called El Limon. There you are to take a 30-minute horseback ride to reach the waterfall. Once there, you have around 30 minutes to go swimming. Afterwards, you are to be taken by horseback back to the entrance. Around 5:00pm, you are to be taken via a 40-minute drive to the town of Sanchez. There you can purchase dinner. There are no luxury restaurants in Sanchez. After your meal, you are to be taken via a 2.5-hour drive back to your hotel. You should be there around 9:00pm. Get some sleep.



Day 3: The Caribbean's Most Underrated City, Colonial Santo Domingo



Before relocating to the resort city of Punta Cana, explore the colonial capital of Dominican Republic. Today we visit the oldest permanent European settlement of the New World, Santo Domingo. There we are provided with a guided tour. The colonial zone is an architectural gem that truly feels detached from the rest of the city. Think of attractive Spanish era squares, monuments and parks, shirtless men playing dominoes, good food, exciting music (not least bachata and meringue) and an amazing nightlife scene. The Old Town (a.k.a. Zona Colonial) has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including the residence of Alcázar de Colón, Fortaleza Ozama Castle and Primada de America Cathedral. Although the Old Town deserves most of our time, the outer areas of Gazcue and the Malecon are worth exploring too. All in all, the capital of the Dominican Republic is arguably one of the region’s most underrated destinations.



Day 4: An Open Bar on & Catamaran Ride to Catalina Island as Well as Visiting a Mediterranean-Style Village



We are taken this morning to a dock near to La Romana. There we take the catamaran departure to Catalina Island. Lunch is included today, as is an open bar once on Catalina Island. The island offers a diverse preservation of ecosystems, including sand dunes, mangroves and reefs. Formed out of coral stone, the island contains three overlapping plateaus. The seas around the island are rich in wildlife, with many species of birds and tropical marine fish. Catalina Island is especially popular for snorkeling.



Once we have returned to the dock near to La Romana, we are taken to Altos de Chavon. At this recreated Mediterranean style village located atop the Chavon River, we are provided with a guided tour. Altos de Chavon hosts a cultural center, an archeological museum and an amphitheater.



Day 5: Riding Along Mangroves, Sampling Local Chocolates & Coffee & Swimming at a Waterfall



Firstly, we are taken to Montaña Redonda (a.k.a. Mount Redonda). There we take some nice photos as well as go on swings. Next, we are taken to a national park called Salto de Yanigua. There we go swimming at the waterfall as well as sample local chocolates and coffee. Lunch is included on today’s tour. After our meal, we are taken to a dock located at Caño Hondo. There we take a boat inside Los Haitises National Park, riding along mangroves and checking out some caves with ancient petroglyphs.



Los Haitises National Park is a protected virgin forest with little road access. The number of tourists allowed is limited, but since 2000, it has been a relatively popular destination for ecotourism. There is a multitude of caverns created by water erosion.



Day 6: Another Open Bar on the Country's Most Popular Yet ""Deserted"" Island



We take a morning catamaran or speedboat departure to Saona Island. Lunch and an open bar on the island are included today. Saona Island is a popular destination for tourists from all over the Dominican Republic, who arrive daily in fleets of catamarans and small motorboats. Saona is known for its beaches and has been used on a number of occasions by filmmakers and advertisers looking for a stereotypical ""deserted island"" setting for their film or product.

I got laid off by a company that had a tuition reimbursement program. I have been taking advantage of that to take classes and learn new skills. I have started a new job but they do not have education benefits. I really want to keep taking classes but my schedule only allows for another part-time job (at most 25-30 hours, ideally around 20 hours). I plan on taking community college classes, so even if the reimbursement amount is small like $1000-2000 I’d appreciate it. Wanted to see if anyone has any leads.

I would be super interested in anything coffee related but more than willing to do other things. I already have a degree so the Starbucks program is not for me. Remote would be great, but I know those opportunities are hard to come by especially for part-time.

Thanks in advance for any information!!",0,1730917032.0,SaltLakeCity,0,0.5,False

1gl52rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlieTheTraveler/comments/1gl52rr/costa_rica_where_should_i_visit_what_itinerary/,Costa Rica: Where Should I Visit & What Itinerary Should I Follow?,"Below is an article I wrote in which I explained where in Costa Rica I think you should visit, how much time I think you should spend at each of these recommended destinations and the order in which to visit these destinations. Feel free to direct message me if you need help.



Day 1: A Social Gathering on the Sand & Horseback Riding



Start your tour to Costa Rica in Tamarindo. This beach village is a popular destination for couples and families looking for a good time. Tamarindo is the epitome of everything Costa Rica prides itself on. Let's head to the beach, where there is likely to be a gathering of some sort. On a side note, Tamarindo is also home to leatherback turtles. The day ends with horseback riding at the nearby beaches of Conchal and Brasilito.



Day 2: Sunset Catamaran Cruise with an Open Bar & Appetizers & Going Snorkeling



Today we do a cruise into the bay. We are provided with snorkeling gear, lunch and access to an open bar. Enjoy the sunset while “sipping on some bubbly.”



Day 3: Ready to Fly Like a Bird?



We relocate from Tamarindo near to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. There we go on a zip-lining tour. This reserve draws roughly 70,000 visitors a year. It consists of over 10,500 hectares of cloud forest and 6 ecological zones, 90 percent of which are virgin forest. A high biodiversity-consisting of over 2,500 plant species, 100 species of mammals, 400 bird species, 120 reptilian and amphibian species and thousands of insects-has drawn scientists and tourists alike.



Note that children under 6 years old are not allowed to go ziplining.



Day 4: Rappelling, Climbing & Hiking & Bathing in Natural Hot Springs



We relocate from Monteverde to the town of La Fortuna. Shortly thereafter, we are taken on an adrenaline-pumping adventure to the Lost Canyon. There we climb and hike and otherwise go waterfall rappelling.



After the Lost Canyon, we are taken to one of the many natural hot springs in La Fortuna. More specifically, we are taken to a resort called Ecotermales Fortuna. There we bathe as well as eat.



Note that children under 6 years old are not allowed to go rappelling.



Day 5: Walking Over Hanging Bridges & Swimming Under a Waterfall



Today we are taken on a tour to the nearby surroundings. First is Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges Park, which features cool-looking bridges hanging in the tropical rain forest. Next is La Fortuna Waterfall, where we can go swimming. Following the waterfall is lunch. Lastly for today is Arenal Volcano National Park. It offers a nice hike amid tropical scenery. The volcano measures at least 1,633 meters (5,358 feet) high and is estimated to be less than 7,500 years old.



Day 6: A Green & Calm River, a Thermal Pool & Geysers



We go on a daytrip today. We are taken to Tenorio Volcano National Park. The jewel of this national park is its volcano, from which it receives its name. Tenorio Volcano consists of 4 volcanic peaks and 2 craters. Thermal springs and small geysers dot the area, as do green rivers (Celeste River), waterfalls and lagoons. The upper area of the park is dominated by primary cloud forest, while the lower regions are carpeted with rain forest. The summit can be reached via the Lago Las Dantas Trail, which winds up the volcano and passes through forested terrain before eventually reaching the peak. From the park’s entrance, it takes about an hour to hike up to the peak/main viewpoint.



Day 7: The Country's Most Famous Beach & Creepers in the Night



We relocate from La Fortuna to Manuel Antonio. We see why this town is so popular with tourists. Its national park receives almost 150,000 visitors annually. Manuel Antonio is Costa Rica at its most tropical. Let's head to the beach. In the evening, we go on a tour inside a park to see night creatures.



Day 8: White Sand & Taking a Surf Class



The day starts with a guided tour inside Manuel Antonio National Park. This park has impressive landscapes and several coves. Extra time is given so we can go swimming. The second half of the day is spent taking a surfing class.



Day 9: Discovering Wildlife Inside an Animal Kingdom



Before relocating to the capital of Costa Rica, San Jose, we have time to relax and enjoy the many white-sand beaches and lush foliage amidst great mountains and forests.



Day 10: The Most Stunning Volcano in Costa Rica & a Coffee Plantation Visit



We go on a daytrip today. We are first taken to Doka Estate. There we are provided with breakfast followed by a guided tour of a coffee plantation. Next, we visit Poás Volcano National Park. There we are provided with a guided tour. Please note that Poás Volcano National Park is often closed due to eruptions. If this is the case during your visit, then this park would need to be removed from today’s itinerary. Lastly, we visit La Paz Waterfall. There we are provided with a guided tour.



Day 11: Our Tour Ends This Morning



San Jose is the final destination on our tour around Costa Rica.",1,1730917030.0,CharlieTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

There is no need for a hair dryer. A towel will do.  
If you think you need a hair dryer, then your hair is too long. Keep it short!

**Oven**    
A stove is enough to get the perfect nutrition. Replace baking / broiling / roasting with boiling / steaming / sautéing.

**Equipment-heavy sports**  
If you are storing a lot of sports equipment, you are doing the wrong sports.  
Instead of scuba diving, ice hockey, skiing, sailing, golf, motorsports or football, do: hiking, running, swimming, bodyweight training.

**Bookshelf**  
Readers love buying new books and installing new bookshelves. They will not admit that having a bookshelf is a form of hoarding.  
Read one book at a time. Do not buy new books unless needed. Do not keep books around that you have finished already.

**Sofa / couch**  
A couch is completely unnecessary and will mess up your back. Use instead: Chair / Bed / Floor / Standing 

**Some more unnecessary things**:  
Vacuum Cleaner -> Broom+mop  
TVSet / GamingConsole -> PC / laptop  
Toaster -> Pan on a stove  
Can Opener -> Use a knife  
Bottle opener -> No need to drink alcohol  
Blender / mixer -> Whisk / fork  
Toilet basin freshener -> Clean your toilet  
Dishwasher -> Sink   
Electric Shaver -> Safety razor / scissors  
Coffee machine -> Drink water instead",0,1730916751.0,minimalism,20,0.09,False
