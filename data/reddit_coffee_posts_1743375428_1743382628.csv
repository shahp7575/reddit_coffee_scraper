No significant medical history prior to this

For the past four years I have been getting episodes of debilitating fatigue and brain fog at around the same time every day (usually 11 am-12). Usually last 2-3 hours. Got so bad I had to take time off from a very loved career. During these episodes I can barely stand up or function, I am bowled over with otherworldly fatigue. Not just ‚Äútired‚Äù but complete trance like mental shut down. Before and after them I am generally okay though I have some pervasive fatigue in general, at other times of the day I can power through. They are very episodic and follow the same daily circadian rhythm.

Doctors I‚Äôve seen:
Neurology
Endocrinology
Infectious Diseases
Psychiatry 
Sleep medicine/sleep study

Things we‚Äôve tried altering: sleep times and patterns, eating or not eating (fasting), continuous blood sugar monitoring, ultra hydration and electrolytes, coffee or no coffee, antidepressants (Wellbutrin and then Zoloft) 

Things I know they‚Äôve checked for: narcolepsy, celiac, diabetes, anemia, vitamin deficiency, thyroid, all the CBC and metabolic panels, brain and spine MRI. Not depression (per psychiatrist and therapist consult), full of motivation and passion for life but physically can‚Äôt function when this happens. Stuck lying in a bed but desperate to be up doing the things I love. 

If it wasn‚Äôt for the sleep test coming back mostly normal I would think it‚Äôs narcolpesy. I don‚Äôt necessarily fall asleep but it‚Äôs like a ‚Äúfatigue attack.‚Äù It came on one day suddenly in 2021 when I was working‚Äîjust overcome with fatigue and had to lie down.

I sleep 9 hours a night. Will sometimes take a Benadryl to sleep but not a nightly thing. Neither sleep doctor nor psychiatrist could pin this to sleep or sleep hygiene. Prior to this happening I was an avid runner and very healthy. I no longer have the energy to run. 

So far the closest I‚Äôve gotten to a diagnosis is ME/CFS chronic fatigue syndrome but the specialists agree that CFS is not usually so episodic. I am high functioning outside these episodes (professor and a mother) but it became so disabling I had to take medical leave from work. Every day I‚Äôll start out OK but within a few hours I experience profound exhaustion and brain fog. Then I rest for several hours and I recover‚Äîit‚Äôs like a heavy fog that lifts. It‚Äôs the daily circadian pattern that baffles the doctors. I feel like somebody is missing something. I‚Äôm open minded to any cause and have been seeing a therapist but she can‚Äôt find any psychological cause for it. Can you think of anything that would cause such disabling fatigue attacks?

Edited to add: the only other major medical symptom I have going on is frequent severe constipation. I‚Äôve always assumed this is benign/normal and just use Miralax or Mag Citrate but adding just in case there could be any connection to the fatigue. But the fatigue is not like being tired, it‚Äôs like a complete body and mental shut-down. ",1,1743382514.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jnrcv8,https://i.redd.it/27cli7i1bxre1.jpeg,My Life Under ARFID,"
Hello everyone, my name is Adam. I'm 36 years old and from South Carolina.

I've suffered from ARFID all my life, rejecting most foods since I was able to eat solids.

Like most people, my family thought I was just a picky toddler and that it would eventually sort itself out.

I remember my mom having to get special meals for me, like frozen pizza. I was absolutely terrified of dinner time.

My dad‚Äîand especially his family‚Äîweren't as understanding. I remember his sister taking a group of kids out for dinner and demonizing me as a three-year-old in a restaurant, without either of my parents there to see.

My dad died of lung cancer when I was seven, and my food struggles never really got better. My mom sent me to mini summer camps, and I‚Äôd practically starve all week unless it was breakfast time. Breakfast had so many safe foods. It wasn‚Äôt so bad once I learned how to turn off the hunger switch in my brain.

Then came dating, which absolutely terrified me. I had no confidence, and while I kept ARFID mostly secret, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt cool, suave, or handsome‚Äîthat I was ugly, unwanted, and a despicable freak.

I asked out two girls, and both experiences went south. In retrospect, they weren‚Äôt anything special‚ÄîI just wanted someone I thought matched me.

I saw a thing about ARFID back when it was called Selective Eating Disorder. I loved knowing I wasn't alone but the show had a guy going on a date and the woman practically ran away silently screaming. That didn't help... 

My first girlfriend came when I was twenty-one. I remember being so happy and excited to have someone, but... I settled.

She wasn‚Äôt pretty, wasn‚Äôt very bright, couldn‚Äôt hold a job, and I had to teach her to drive. She was extremely selfish and incapable of being there for me emotionally.

Still, I got engaged and married to her‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt think I could do better. I spent ten years being mostly miserable, loathing my entire existence. Then one day, I realized I was someone who could be properly loved by a real woman.

So I divorced her. My mom admitted she had always wondered why I got with her in the first place.

Dating again was scary. I still kept ARFID a secret because it wasn‚Äôt something you admit on the first date. I often chose coffee shops with milkshakes as a way to avoid the issue until the right time.

Then I met Jessica, who completely triggered my anxiety by inviting me to a Mexican restaurant for our first date. I was so nervous, but I ordered nachos with cheese and did my best. It went... okay with my plate.

And she wanted a second date. And soon, we were a couple. She was everything I had ever wanted, and I knew I had to tell her eventually. With tears streaming down my face, I admitted it to her‚Äîand she accepted me, despite being a foodie herself.

I had never felt so validated. We got engaged less than a year later and married before the next Christmas. Our son was born the following summer.

I went from feeling alone, depressed, and worthless to having a true partner, being a real husband, and having a family‚Äîin less than two years.

My safe foods are decently numerous. At restaurants, pizza, pretzels, and French fries are my staples.

Thanks to Jessica, I've accepted that I have a disability. But I am not a freak. And I am loved. ",1,1743382428.0,ARFID,0,1.0,False

## Why Invest in Quality Outdoor Cocktail Tables?

Before diving into our top picks, let's consider the importance of investing in quality outdoor cocktail tables. These tables are not just functional; they contribute significantly to the overall aesthetic and customer experience.

*   **Enhanced Ambiance:** Stylish outdoor pub tables and bistro outdoor tables instantly elevate the look and feel of any outdoor space. A well-chosen table design can complement your brand and create a more inviting atmosphere for customers.
*   **Increased Functionality:** Outdoor cocktail tables provide a convenient spot for customers to place drinks and appetizers, enhancing their comfort and enjoyment. This leads to longer stays and potentially higher spending.
*   **Durability and Longevity:** Investing in durable outdoor tables made from weather-resistant materials ensures long-lasting performance, even in harsh weather conditions. This reduces the need for frequent replacements and saves money in the long run. Especially important for commercial outdoor tables intended for heavy use.
*   **Customer Appeal:** Attractive and well-maintained outdoor furniture creates a positive first impression. Welcoming patio cocktail tables subconsciously tells you the establishment cares about their appearance and thus probably the customer's experience.
*   **Accommodating Various Needs:** Adjustable height outdoor tables and outdoor cocktail table sets can cater to diverse customer preferences and group sizes. Folding outdoor cocktail tables offer flexibility for event spaces that require easy setup and storage.

*   **Intended Use:** Will the tables be used for casual drinks, dining, or a combination of both? This will influence the size and height of the table you need.
*   **Space Availability:** Measure your outdoor space to determine the number of tables you can comfortably accommodate without overcrowding.Small outdoor tables are ideal for maximizing space in compact areas.

*   **Maintenance:** Consider the ease of cleaning and maintenance. Some materials require more upkeep then others.
*   **Storage:** If you need to store the tables when not in use, folding or stackable outdoor tables are the best options.
*   **Budget:** determine your budget and find tables that offer the best value for your money.*   **Additional Features:** Do you need tables with umbrella holes for shade? Integrated drink holders? These features can enhance the customer experience.

Throw away account because my husband knows my regular account. 

Preface to this story is that my husband has a history of porn addiction, has a cross dressing fetish that he went to great lengths to hide from me (and lied about on many occasions) and was caught with a photo on his phone of my good friend in a bikini zoomed in on her chest. Of course he denied any wrong doing but given his past, I can only assume what he was doing with that photo. I have also tried to leave him on several occasions but have always gone back due to what I think is a trauma bond.  He makes it very hard on me by guilt tripping me into staying. He is also known as a really nice guy to friends and family, regularly volunteers with our son‚Äôs sports and at his school. He is known as a good guy. He is an active father and a good one. 

I have known for the last few years that I have been in an emotionally abusive relationship. I used to think he was not capable of physically harming me but something recently happened that has completely upended my belief.

Over the last year, he has started this routine where he wants to make it all about me and pleasure me only with his hand. He says he wants nothing in return. He wants to do this for me because ‚ÄúI deserve it and am deserving of pleasure.‚Äù He does this in the morning while we are laying in bed awake about to get up. I was on vacation in a foreign country with my husband and our son. It was a work trip for me which meant that this trip was largely subsidized and it was truly the trip of a lifetime. The entire trip my husband was exhibiting ingratiating behaviour. Bringing me coffee in bed, making me breakfast, telling my colleagues how much I loved my job and how happy it makes me (which was awkward because I was right there and could speak for myself). Almost every morning of the trip he tries to pleasure me with his hand. Some mornings I am too tired to resist and deal with his insecurity afterward. One morning I got the courage to say no, definitively. He continued touching me. I said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt take no for an answer, do you‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt respond. Just continued until my body orgasmed (which I HATED myself for). 

I didn‚Äôt realize right away the gravity of what happened. It took me a few months. Then, last week, it almost happened again. I told him no as he put his hands on my vagina. He then said to me, ‚Äúif I keep going, will you be upset?‚Äù To which I responded very clearly, yes. He stopped. But it dawned on me he was about to do it again. 

I am desperate for someone to validate what happened to me. That this ‚Äògood guy‚Äô husband sexually assaulted me. That he was willing to do it again. That he masks this behaviour by labelling it as loving and doting. That he thinks I am ‚Äòdeserving‚Äô even though I clearly said I didn‚Äôt want it.

I am going back to therapy next week after a two year hiatus. I plan on bringing this up. But I needed to get this off my chest today, as it‚Äôs all consuming and I‚Äôve told no one. I feel so used and alone. 

Desperate for someone to validate that I was sexually abused by my husband. Any and all insights welcome üôè

Can we move off reddit? With time I‚Äôm open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I‚Äôm not having a Snapstreak with you. Snapchat isn‚Äôt for me anymore, other apps are fine. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don‚Äôt want to put too many perimeters as to what I‚Äôm looking for because I‚Äôm flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

32M, My recent blood test results came out and doctor told me I am pre-diabetic, high cholesterol levels and low in vitamin D3 and Folate etc. I know this all happened due to my negligence over the time. I have been looking for a job in IT since more than a year now. I was active and very much positive in the first 2 or 3 months of my job search time but after few interview failures, I felt demotivated, stressed and lazy. I got a retail minimum wage job just for surviving. Since then, 

* when i get leisure time in the weekends or weekdays, I tend to buy booze and order food outside. and I eat more than required watching some movie or series while drinking. 
* I also tend to have coffee with so much sugar(I like sweet foods or drinks) in the morning for bowel movement and sometime even if my stomach is cleaned out, I feel something is incomplete and drink it.
* I am planning to learn a new tech skill for better job opportunities. I think of spending 3 or more hours per day to study but I end up spending only an hour to the max and then I scroll social media. I can't afford wasting this much time per day. 

I have been doing this since almost an year now. I want to stop these habits. I sometimes think about stopping all these but tend to do it again saying to myself I will stop from the next week but it's hard to resist totally.

1jnr7q1,https://i.redd.it/l81199fp9xre1.jpeg,"Payers of reddit, need help again.","Hello pawyers and kittos of reddit. It is me, Phantom, once again, coming to ask for the helps.

As many of you may remember, 2 big colds ago, the Mother went away for 3 forevers, and when she returned, she and the Father came back with the loud potatoe. As you can see, a big hot and a big cold has passed, I have done many supervizises, and the loud potatoe has grown into a proper human kitten. He sings the song of the people well, knows how to drop the yummy foods to the floor, and is walking on all fours properly, although the Mother and the Father and Nana are trying to mess that up with only using 2 feets, which is silly.

Sadly, the doge has taught my loud potatoe how to do the awoo, which he likes to sing almost as much as the song of the people, and Sister Machiko has taught him to play chase, which I do not like, but my potatoe is smart, and it only took 3 hisses and 2 scratches for him to learn to not bapbapbap me when I hide from him. The Mother and the Father try to keep him from chasing me, but they are not perfect like us kittos, so I forgive them.

However, there is problem, and I am needing help.

The Mother and the Father are smelling sad.

They say that some forevers ago, that I had a stroke, and that is why I can not jump as good and am so dizzy all the time. They have been giving me lots of treatos and cuddles, but for the past few forevers, I have not been hungry, not even for the mushy baby food chimken or the Father's steak. Not even for the tuna. I am sleepy, but I have bad dreams. 

The Mother and Father make sure I have comfy places to rest, and they did give me the chair when the loud potatoe got too big for it. It is in a nice sunny spot. They give me soft pets and good scritches. But they are sad. And I don't want them to be sad. Can I soos for them to be happy?  I know they are taking me to the pokey place tomorrow to see what the pokey person can do to help. I'm not scared, because the Mother and the Father will be there with me like they always are.  I just don't want them to be sad. Even if soos don't help, please help supervize Mother and Father, and supervize the potatoe. Sister Machiko is good kitto, but she can't do it by herself with only the dumb doge to help.


(Phantom had a pretty bad stroke 2 months ago, bad enough we weren't sure she would recover, but she's stubborn, lol, like most calicos. Her depth perception and balance went to crap, but other than not being able to jump, and needing help finding the toys to play, she went back to basically normal after 3 days. Then this week she's taken a pretty severe turn, hardly eating, throwing up when she does eat or drink, and refusing her favorite human food treats.

This is the cat who will climb up a counter, knock over a coffee machine, kick over dishes, and rip open an unopened package of beef jerky if she sees you putting it away in front of her and turn your back for 5 minutes, turning away when you offer her a piece. Normally you'd lose your hand and a piece of your soul if you try to hang onto it for too long in her presence. Nothing we've offered has tempted her.

So, with her decline, and with her being 17 years old, we are going to the vets tomorrow to get an evaluation. Keep Phantom in your hearts please. Us too.)",5,1743381980.0,legalcatadvice,1,1.0,False

* **Mamey Popeye crab** (crab tartlet with an umami topping) 
* **Scallops sanki jalapeno** (wow‚Ä¶ cold scallops in a soup with clams and veggies on top)
* **Lobster and huacatay** (great two-part lobster dish.  The baby corn tricked us into thinking it was octopus at first) 
* **Paiche, Yuca and tucupi** (bbq fish like you would see in a sweet bbq quail dish) 
* **Andean curry** (incredible‚Äîfull stop, perfectly cooked fish, incredible curry, great contrasts with coconut foam and lime) 
* **lamb parsnip mango** (lamb raviolis, the potato was so thin and crispy and held things well.  Best lamb dish I‚Äôve eaten, a close second being at Hermanos Torres in BCN)
* **Cocona honey and lemon verbena** (icy sour, balanced cleanser) 
* **Coconut lache and tumbo** (wonderful sorbet, so savory, sweet and umami) 
* **Corn coffee and sacha papa** (cloud of air that dissolved on the tongue)

I had more than one interesting conversation today. 

One day. 24 hours - 23 if you count daylight savings. Fewer hours than most days - but far more worth the time spent living it.

Reassurance might as well be the word of the day.

Reassurance - surely - cannot come from the self.  
  
Who reassured me?   
  
In chronological order: My mum, my mates, a local comedian, some random geezer.  
  
In fact - we might as well start today as it began: Mightnight.  
  
 Tuned into Twitch on Saturday night - as I often do - but I couldn't muster the strength to keep my eyeballs open. Shame.

So I switched the battle station off. Lights out, meatball.

Except I didn't sleep. I tossed and turned for a couple of hours.

Suddenly I remembered - ""You're going to be on stage in June"". 

""Oh, fuck!"" I thought.

I don't suffer from writers block - I feel like that is self-evident. But I do suffer from an inner critic. 

I had, all of a sudden, took stock of what I intended to say on stage in June. 

All of a sudden, I wasn't so tired.

Quite the opposite. I was fired up.

I had swiftly kicked myself up the arse. 

I was not about to boot my PC back up - but I was deep in thought. 

How many angles could you approach this from? Which angles are worthy of your time? What the fuck are you doing, dickhead? 

Point taken - time is of the essence. 

I jotted down a few notes. I mentally scrunched up a couple of pieces of paper - they weren't ""good enough"".   
  
They were not fit for human consumption.

For context - Friday night spawned an absolute write-off a Saturday. I was phucked. Minced. A bit delicate.

Anyway, anyway, anyway...

It was Mother's day this Sunday. Time to honour thy mother. 

I woke up late. Midday had came and gone. I had every intention of meeting my self-imposed quota of work.

There was simply not enough time in the day.

Ages ago, fucking yonks ago, I had agreed to see a comedian tonight. I paid for the ticket, I had etched it into my mental diary.

The shape that this Sunday would take was somewhat pre-defined. Here's one I made earlier...

It was Mother's day - I had plans in the evening. There was scarcely enough time to loaf about and let circumstance take hold.

So - I did what I ought to do. I phoned my mum. 

She felt like getting out the house anyway, so we decided to meet for coffee - maybe even lunch.

We did just that! Unfortunately, I had some car trouble. One of my tyres seemed to be a bit flat.   
  
As it happened, YouTube was pushing this [particular song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y71iDvCYXA) my way. Funny shit, right? 

I mean, sure, I've listen to it before - it has it's place in my algorithm - but it's never been pushed to my homepage. 

Totally makes sense that YouTube has an intimate knowledge of my tyre pressure - rather than some absurd alternative explanation that only a certified lunatic would conceive of...

But yeah, I felt a sense of ""Fuck off, if you don't fancy buying into my worldview - you've got your own worldview to buy into. I'm sure it pays meaty dividends."" 

Anyway, lunacy aside, I met my mum for a coffee.

Lovely wee lunch. We got sidewinded into talking about ""politics"". 

I put that in quotes, because we were really talking about attitude. 

The kind of attitude that seems to be something fundamental across borders, across religions, across political beliefs. 

To sum it up ""What a fucking clown show"". 

The irony of it all. The absurdity of it all. The simple fact that clowns, evidently, run the show. 

A minor synchronicity took place - and I'll mention it for the sake of trying to compel you.

I learned that someone had passed away. A young guy - all things considered. 

Don't even get me started on what is considered a ""young adult"" in this day and age. 

Sure, we live longer - but that label only serves to normalise the economic chokehold we're in.

Totally normal that rent has quadrupled over the past few decades, while wages haven't even doubled. 

Cost of living crisis? It costs fuck all to exists - need I even remind you? 

Anyway. A young man passed away. Someone who I can't claim to know very well. 

My brother knew him, and I'm sure many people knew him. 

The synchronicity in question was this: after our lunch, I dropped my mum off at a local supermarket. 

She sent me a text message not long after - letting me know that, for the first time in years, she saw this young man's parents.

Funny that. Well, not laugh out loud funny - of course not - but odd? Maybe even meaningful? Maybe even a mix of odd and meaningful? 

Sure, they live locally, it's hardly out of the norm - but she said it herself. It was the first time she had seen them in years. 

Anyway, I couldn't really give a fuck what you think about my YouTube recommendations or who my mother bumped into. 

I'd love to draw you into my lunacy, but maybe this town ain't big enough for the both of us?

Time marches on. 

After dropping my mum off - I went home to log some hours at work. 

It all went according to plan - I got it out of the way. I awarded myself the medal of ""Not-entirely-useless"".

Around 7pm - it was time to rendezvous with my friends. We were meeting in town, and heading to the ""toon"".

We call the city the ""toon"" - but who cares? Vatican city is a county - anything goes, apparently?

I'll avoid namedropping, on this occasion, but we went to see a homegrown comedian who me and my friends had never seen before.

Despite never having seen in him person - we all had the same impression based on his social media presence. He would surely be ""up to scratch"". 

Before we fucked off the train, I started to talk to my friends about how I was ""getting my arse into gear"" with regards to my own set.

They were wonderfully reassuring. Any angle you like. ""Nothing to lose"", ""I like listening to you"", ""You've came this far"" - blah, blah blah.

I think I ""needed to hear it"" - as much as I don't like admitting that I doubt myself.

We went to the gig. We went to a venue I'd heard of - but never been to before.

Lovely wee space. ""Intimate"" in the sense that we were packed in like sardines. Oh, the joys...

¬£7.50 for a pint of wanky IPA. Fuck that for a laugh.

I think I learned a lot from being there tonight. I probably smiled more than I laughed but - I swear to fuck - I really *heard* what this guy had to say.

A valuable bit of reconnaissance. Seeing someone who has treaded the boards far more than me doing just that. It was an education. It was funny shit. 

They touched on a few topics that weren't a million miles away from my own (shite) patter. Ideal.

The show ended, we headed for the train. The plan was to go for a pint after the train, but my mate's girlfriend was tired. 

We decided to call it a night. 

My other mate - who works in a bar - was on shift tonight.

I decided to pop in for a pint, flying solo. 

It's slightly less tragic chatting to a barmaid when you actually know them - at least.

I had a pint, I ordered another. 

By the time I started to consume the other pint - an older gentleman planted himself beside me at the bar.

He was moaning - jokingly - that they didn't serve ""Canadian whiskey"". 

I couldn't resist asking him ""What's wrong with Scottish Whisky?"". 

He proudly declared ""I'm just trying to piss off Donald Trump!"". 

Fuck yes, now we're talking!

I enthusiastically agreed with him. I brought up Trump's Scottish heritage.  We shit-talked the general lay of the land. 

We talked about how Scottish A-list celebrities seem to lose their accents. We talked about local celebrities, and how they put Paisley on the map. 

It was a nice mix of love and hate.

We veered right into politics. 

This man - who was about my dad's age, as he explicitly made me aware of - mentioned that he studied economics at university. 

I told him I love maths - but that economics makes my mind boggle. He insisted on telling me all about how much debt the labour party left the Tories, just before I was born. ?

He balanced this complaint out with a general ""Fuck the Tories"" attitude. This, at least, painted a picture that this man was a universal complainer - just like me!

I asked him - ""Has there ever been a prime minister that you felt was competent?"" 

He responded, emphatically, that the answer was no. He mentioned to me that if I wanted to know what the government was up to - I should buy the white paper.

He mentioned, complaining-ly, that the fuckers make you pay 20 quid for it. 

I replied, like a true contrarian, that such papers - and the whole political process - was totally inaccessible to the average person. 

Frankly, it's undemocratic. 

How could someone well informed about the economy, versus someone who loves maths but can't make sense of economics, versus someone who doesn't even know what the fuck we're talking about - make an equally informed decision?

We talked about all this debt. We talked about how as the year's pass, the ""owner"" or ""instigator"" of this debt or that debt might vary - but the people who foot the bill never change. 

The people who cannot reasonably make an equally informed decision are being charged for the whole damn lot. 

I mentioned that I was planning to a bit of comedy.

He remarked, accurately, that I hadn't been particularly funny for the duration of our conversation. 

And he was right - I was fucking pissed off.

But he did say this: if I get on stage and give a voice to this kind of thing, then people like him would be happy to hear it. 

He went a bit further - laying it on a bit thick. This was reassuring - I wont lie to you.

""Please take me seriously - I'm a comedian"" - a laughably backwards statement. 

But that's just it. At least whatever I say on stage is honest. 

The average person is honest. The average person knows that politics is a fucking clown show.

The average person knows that the state of the world is beyond a fucking joke.

What can be said of democracy when the majority of people know we're fucked - but we can only watch the world devolve? Helplessly, from a distance.

It's the blind leading the fucked.

So yeah, as much as I don't think think it's particularly funny - I think I need to rework my set.

Got to get a bit more political.

Embarking on a ketogenic diet can be both exciting and challenging, especially when it comes to navigating your favorite food and drink choices. Milk, a staple in many people's diets, often raises questions for those following a keto lifestyle. If you're wondering whether you can enjoy milk while maintaining ketosis, you're not alone. The relationship between milk and the keto diet is more nuanced than a simple yes or no answer. Different types of milk have varying carbohydrate contents that can significantly impact your ketogenic goals. Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

## Understanding Milk and Keto: The Basics

The ketogenic diet is fundamentally about minimizing carbohydrate intake while increasing fat consumption. Milk, naturally, contains carbohydrates in the form of lactose, which can potentially disrupt ketosis if consumed in large quantities. Not all milk is created equal, and some varieties are more keto-friendly than others.

### Types of Milk and Their Carbohydrate Content

Here's a breakdown of different milk types and their carbohydrate profiles:

- **Whole Milk**: Approximately 12 grams of carbs per cup
- **Skim Milk**: Around 12-13 grams of carbs per cup
- **Almond Milk (Unsweetened)**: 1-2 grams of carbs per cup
- **Coconut Milk (Unsweetened)**: 1 gram of carbs per cup
- **Heavy Cream**: 0.4 grams of carbs per tablespoon

## Keto-Friendly Milk Alternatives

### Low-Carb Milk Options

**Almond Milk**: An excellent choice for keto dieters, unsweetened almond milk provides minimal carbohydrates while offering a creamy texture. Most brands contain only 1-2 grams of carbs per cup, making it a safe option for those tracking their carbohydrate intake.

### Full-Fat Dairy Options

**Heavy Cream** and **Half-and-Half**: These high-fat dairy products are much more keto-friendly. Heavy cream contains minimal carbs and can be an excellent addition to coffee, smoothies, or cooking.

## Potential Risks of Drinking Regular Milk on Keto

Consuming traditional cow's milk can potentially kick you out of ketosis due to its higher carbohydrate content. A single cup of whole milk contains approximately 12 grams of carbs, which could consume a significant portion of your daily carbohydrate allowance on a strict ketogenic diet.

### Lactose Intolerance Considerations

Many individuals following a keto diet also experience lactose intolerance. Plant-based or lactose-free alternatives might be more suitable for these individuals.

## Practical Tips for Milk Consumption on Keto

### Smart Milk Choices

1. Always choose **unsweetened** varieties
2. Opt for full-fat options
3. Measure your portions carefully
4. Consider alternative milk sources

**Pro Tip**: Use a food tracking app to monitor your exact carbohydrate intake when consuming milk products.

## Scientific Perspective on Milk and Ketosis

Research suggests that moderate consumption of low-carb milk alternatives can be incorporated into a ketogenic diet without disrupting metabolic ketosis. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Nutrition highlighted that carefully selected dairy products can support nutritional needs while maintaining low-carbohydrate intake.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Keto Journey

Ultimately, the key to incorporating milk into a keto diet is **moderation** and **informed selection**. By choosing low-carb alternatives and monitoring your overall carbohydrate intake, you can enjoy dairy-like beverages without compromising your ketogenic goals.

## Conclusion

Navigating milk choices on a keto diet requires careful consideration and knowledge. While traditional milk might be challenging, numerous alternatives exist that can satisfy your dairy",1,1743381492.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

1jnr0ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1jnr0ma/tips_from_my_recent_solo_trip/,Tips from my recent solo trip,"Hey all! I recently went to Paris for my first solo trip, here are some tips for anyone who might find it useful!

- **Learn basic phrases in French**, like *bonjour*, *bonsoir*, *merci*, and *au revoir*. Obviously locals will know you‚Äôre not French, but this effort goes a long way. I found Parisians were friendly and welcoming!
- **Dining alone is not weird.** I usually brought a book with me and it was great just to sit and enjoy my meal and read my book. Nobody looked at me twice.
- **If there‚Äôs anything on your must-do list, book it as far in advance as possible.** Entry lines for the main attractions are no joke. Instead of wasting time standing in line for tickets, I booked everything I could, usually for the first time slot available. For anything without dedicated time slots, I showed up when the place opened or 1-2 hours before it closed.
- **Buy the Paris Museum Pass if you plan to visit at least one of the included attractions per day.** Personally I love museums and knew I wanted to visit a lot of them. I bought the PMP for 6 days and used it at least 2x per day. Since the PMP activates upon entry to the first site, I tried to visit places that were close together on the same day (Sainte Chapelle, Conciergerie, Notre Dame).
- **Take breaks from crowds in Paris‚Äôs many parks.** I spent a lot of time relaxing in parks and gardens. Jardin des Tuileries and Jardin du Luxembourg are popular for a reason, they are beautiful. But so is Jardin des Plantes and all the other smaller parks dotted around the city!
- **Check out free stuff!** Musee de Carnavalet, Rodin Museum and Petit Palais were gems and completely free to enter. Free entry made me feel less bad about spending only limited time in each.
- **Buy metro tickets on Apple Wallet.** I didn‚Äôt bother buying a physical transit/metro card. I simply loaded the Navigo card on my Apple Wallet and bought individual tickets as I needed them. I didn‚Äôt buy any weekly passes since I mostly walked everywhere.
- **Stay aware and vigilant but don‚Äôt fear pickpockets.** I didn‚Äôt run into any pickpockets but you can often spot people looking for cash/to scam. People loitering (often on their own) at major sites like the Louvre or Sacre Coeur and staring at tourists. Sometimes I was directly approached by people asking for money with a story for why they need cash. I even had someone approach me inside CDG. Usually I just said no, sorry I can‚Äôt help and they moved along. Having a RBF helps.
- **Buy an eSIM**. I used Airalo eSIM which was very reliable. I didn‚Äôt want to rely on wifi since I was alone in case I needed directions or emergency services and wifi isn‚Äôt guaranteed everywhere.
- **Consider staying in the Latin Quarter.** I stayed in the 5th/Latin Quarter because I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be smack dab in tourist central. I was so happy with my decision! I didn‚Äôt feel at all isolated, I was within 5 min walk of 2 metro lines and could walk 15 mins to Le Marais, Jardin du Luxembourg and Jardin des Plantes, and the Pantheon. It was a quieter neighbourhood and I ate at excellent restaurants/boulangeries. I never felt unsafe and loved going for walks at night.
- **My favourite visits** were to the Louvre, Musee d‚ÄôOrsay and Versailles. For Versailles, I downloaded the free app for the chateau which came with free audio guides for every room, the Trianons and the gardens. Yes these places were crowded but it was worth it!
- **Reminder about being respectful in religious spaces.** Please see my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/s/CsPWz3p2Rz
- Last but not least, **make sure to rest**. I walked anywhere from 17k to 21k steps a day. But I made sure to rest in parks, have a coffee at a cafe or even go back to my hotel to take a nap when I felt like it. It‚Äôs vacation, make sure you enjoy it and don‚Äôt let the FOMO push you to the point where you‚Äôre miserable!

1jnr0at,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1jnr0at/whats_the_point/,What‚Äôs the Point?,"This is one of the recurring sentiments  I see in this forum. I don‚Äôt really have an answer. But I am putting my thoughts out there . Just my opinion about my own life. Every one of us here will have a different story 

My wife‚Äôs illness journey was two years. Prior to that, I thought my point in life was 

1. Survive , be healthy, earn enough money to live comfortably 
2. Evolve with my wife. Know as much as I can about why she is the way she is. Adapt to how she is. Nudge her for personal growth. Protect her and equip her to live safely in the corporate world. Enjoy her company. Take care of her. Plan to grow old together 

After she died, I lost a lot. The reason for going to work. The reason for living . The point of living . The purpose of existing . The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is lost

The pain comes from the void. Where the driving force for working hard was. Where safety in existence was. Where fulfillment of life was. Where happiness was. Where home was. It was simply a big empty space . The void was so big, when I say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, it echoes for minutes 

At one point , my brain is finally in sync with reality . She is dead . She will not return. (Definitely not as a zombie as she was cremated) Time continues to go on. Fairness does not matter . It is a man-made concept . My happiness has expired. The components that made it possible is no longer there. Time has left her behind . I am still alive 

The ‚Äúpoint‚Äù of living , as I have built it, is gone . I am now at ground zero. This is a full reset . This will continue to be a fact no matter what I do. I can try to kill myself, when I am dead , this fact remains the same . I can try to continue to live , if i do , it will be so much work. It will still be the same

I was never that guy to shy away from work . Do I still want to live? Yes. Yes, for now . Let‚Äôs see what happens tomorrow . I will put myself to work

I have to rebuild ‚Äúthe point‚Äù contingent on the reasonable time I have in this life given my age. The point is going to be different for everyone

Some of us will want to die asap. 

Some of us will want to live for the children . 

Some of us will want to find a new cause . 

Some of us will want to find new love  

Some of us will want to be by themselves and figure it out

One is not better than the other. For me, allowing life to happen to me is not an option. So ‚Äúthe point‚Äù will always evolve . Let‚Äôs see what happens tomorrow 

For everyone in this forum. I can relate to the pain . I wish peace and a good night sleep for all . Thanks for reading my thinking exercise. Hugs with a good coffee

I remember that day like it was yesterday. The sunlight slanted through the blinds, casting long, tired shadows across the floor. I was sitting by the window, looking out at the quiet street.

The sound of a car passing by broke the silence, but my mind was elsewhere. I had a lot on my mind that morning. Too much, in fact, and none of it made sense. The whole thing started like any other regular day.

I had just come back from the gym, feeling like I'd done something good for myself for the first time in a while. I still remember how the air felt that morning, crisp and cool.

Like it wanted to wash away the exhaustion from my life. For a moment I felt hopeful. Maybe things were turning around. But then my phone buzzed on the table.

It was Sasha. Sasha was the one person I could always count on.

We'd known each other for years. Longer than I could even remember. He was the guy who'd been there when things were good and, more importantly, when things were bad.

I always trusted his judgment, even when he said things I didn't want to hear. I swiped to answer, trying to shake off that uneasy feeling in my chest. Hey man, got a minute?

Sasha's voice was tight, like something was wrong. I sat up straighter, something in his tone made me stop. What's up? I asked, trying to sound normal, but I felt a knot forming in my stomach.

There was a pause on the other end, and then Sasha spoke, slower this time. Look, There's something you need to know, and I don't know how to say it, but you're going to hate me for it."" I frowned, a sudden wave of unease washing over me.

What's going on? I asked trying to stay calm. I didn't want to admit it, but I could feel my heart racing in my chest. There was another pause. This one felt like it lasted forever.

Alex he he sold us out. He betrayed you. I felt like the air had been knocked out of my lungs. I froze for a moment, staring at the phone in disbelief. I didn't know how to respond.

My mind was a whirlwind of thoughts. Alex, my best friend. The guy I'd known since childhood. The one I'd laughed with, fought with, and shared everything with.

The one I trusted with my life. How could he have done that? I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, a mix of confusion and betrayal flooding me. This couldn't be true.

It had to be a mistake. What? What do you mean? I finally managed to say, my voice trembling. I don't know all the details yet, but I've heard enough. He turned us in, man. To the cops.

To the feds. Whoever is in charge of that mess. I don't know how he got involved, but he's the one who sold us out. And I swear to God, he knew exactly what he was doing.

The room felt smaller all of a sudden. like the walls were closing in on me. The sound of my own breathing seemed so loud in my ears, and I could hear my heart beating harder with every word Sasha spoke.

You need to hear this from me, because I don't want you to find out in some way that's worse. I know what it means for us.

Man, you're gonna want answers and you're gonna want them from him. You're gonna have to face him. I didn't say anything for a moment. What was there to say? Sasha was right. I had to see Alex.

I had to hear it from him. I wasn't sure I even wanted to believe it. But the more I thought about it, the more I could feel the ugly truth sinking in.

I didn't know how to process it, how to confront him, but I knew I had to do it. I ran my hand through my hair, feeling the weight of the situation settling in.

Sasha wasn't the type to make things up or exaggerate. If he said Alex had done something like that, it was true. I could already feel the tension in my chest.

The idea of facing Alex after all this, of hearing the truth from him, it felt like I was walking toward a cliff I wasn't sure I could climb back from.

But I had to know. I'll go to him, I said, my voice sounding smaller than I intended. I have to, Sasha sighed heavily. Be careful, man.

I don't know what's gonna happen, but you're gonna want to hear it from him. And don't do anything stupid. I hung up the phone, still holding it in my hand as I sat there, not knowing what to do next.

The room felt suffocating, and the coldness of it seemed to seep into my bones. I couldn't stop replaying Sasha's words in my head.

Alex, how could he? I spent the next few hours just sitting there, going over every memory of him, every conversation we'd had, trying to remember the times when things felt real.

But nothing made sense anymore. If he really had betrayed me, if he had sold us out, what did that mean for everything we'd built together? Eventually, I got up, grabbed my jacket, and headed out. I had no plan, no script for what I was about to do.

But there was only one thing I knew for sure. I needed to see Alex. I needed answers, no matter the cost. The streets outside felt like a different world.

The noise of passing cars, the distant chatter of people going about their lives. It all seemed so distant, so insignificant in comparison to what I was about to do.

My hands were clammy as I gripped the wheel. The engine's hum under my fingers almost drowned out by the pounding in my chest.

I couldn't stop thinking about Sasha's words. You're going to want to hear it from him. What was he going to say? Was he going to deny it?

Was he going to lie to my face? Or worse, was he going to admit it without remorse? I drove to Alex's place, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I couldn't focus on anything else. I barely remembered the route. It was like the whole world had narrowed down to one destination, his apartment.

When I parked outside, I sat there for a moment, my fingers still gripping the steering wheel as I stared at the building. Part of me wanted to just drive away, forget it all, but I knew I couldn't.

I had to confront him, no matter how hard it was, I needed to hear the truth from him. I took a deep breath, wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans, and got out of the car.

The elevator ride up to his floor felt like the longest few seconds of my life. Each floor passed, each moment felt like a countdown to something I couldn't control. My heart was thumping louder than ever. And with every chime of the elevator, I felt my nerves tighten further.

When the doors opened, I stepped out and walked down the hallway. His apartment was at the end, and I could already hear sounds coming from inside. I paused in front of the door. My throat was dry. I knocked, twice. It didn't take long for him to open it.

Alex said, his voice too casual, too normal. His eyes flickered to mine for a split second. Then he looked away, rubbing his hands on his jeans.

I couldn't tell if he was nervous, but I didn't trust him. Not anymore. Can we talk? I asked, the words almost sticking in my throat. My stomach was twisted in knots. He looked me over, hesitated. then stepped aside and let me in without saying a word.

His apartment looked the same as it always had, a little cluttered, not much. The smell of coffee hung in the air, and there was a faint trace of something that reminded me of old books. Nothing had changed, except everything had. I walked in and stopped just inside the door.

Alex stood behind the couch, his arms crossed, staring at me like he was trying to read me, like he was trying to figure out what was coming. I had a thousand questions, but the first one slipped out of my mouth without thinking. Did you do it?

My voice was tight, strained. He blinked like the question caught him off guard. Then he smirked, that old familiar smirk that always made me think he had some kind of joke up his sleeve.

Did I do what? His voice was so damn calm. Sell us out. I took a step forward, my eyes not leaving his. You turned us in, didn't you? To the cops?

To the feds? You did it, Alex. Don't lie to me. He leaned back against the couch, his gaze never leaving mine. There was no guilt in his eyes, no remorse.

Just cold, calculating indifference. Why would you think that? He said it like it was an absurd question, like he couldn't believe I'd even ask.

Because I know, man, I know what you did."" The words tasted bitter, as if I were choking on them. Sasha told me, I don't know all the details, but I know you sold us out. I watched his face carefully, hoping to see some crack, some sign of guilt.

But there was nothing, just that same smile, the one that always made me feel like I was the punchline of some joke I couldn't quite understand. Come on!"" he said with a sigh, pushing off from the couch and walking over to the kitchen. Sasha's paranoid. He's always been.

He's making a big deal out of nothing. I shook my head, feeling my heart drop. Stop lying. I heard the recording. Don't try to cover this up. You know what you did. He froze, just for a second. His back was turned to me, but I could see his shoulders stiffen.

Then, slowly, he turned around with that same nonchalant expression. He chuckled, though it didn't sound genuine. You think I'd do something that stupid? You really think I'd leave a trail for you to follow? You don't know me at all, man. I stepped closer.

You're not fooling anyone. You betrayed us, Alex, and now you're sitting here acting like everything's fine. You're lying to my face. For a moment there was silence, a long stretch of it. I felt the tension thickening in the room, like a storm waiting to break. Then Alex spoke again.

But this time, his tone was different. It was colder, more deliberate. You think I betrayed you, huh? He stepped toward me slowly, his eyes darkening with every word. Let me ask you something. How many times did we get away with things we shouldn't have?

How many times did we play the game, thinking we were untouchable? Did you think it would last forever? I stood frozen, his words slicing through the air like a blade. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what he was saying. I did what I had to do,"" he continued, his voice low now almost like a whisper. I played my part.

You can hate me all you want, but the fact is you were too naive to see it. This isn't a game anymore. It never was. And you, he pointed a finger at me. You didn't see the writing on the wall. You thought we were some kind of team, some kind of family.

Well, wake up, man. That's not how this world works. I stared at him, my thoughts crashing into one another. This wasn't the Alex I knew. The Alex I knew would have never said something like that, would never betray anyone in cold blood.

But here he was, standing in front of me, a stranger with the same face and the same words I couldn't believe. The words hung in the air, thick with something darker than just betrayal.

Alex was standing there, in front of me, like a complete stranger. There was no trace of the guy I grew up with, the guy who'd been my friend for as long as I could remember.

Now, it was like I was looking at a mirror reflecting a version of him that I couldn't recognize. His words, sharp, deliberate, had cut through everything I thought I knew. The room seemed to get smaller, the air heavier with every syllable. I had to blink a few times to process it all.

He was still staring at me, that cold look in his eyes, like he was daring me to believe him. But I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried to twist the situation in my mind, it wasn't adding up.

The Alex I knew would never, could never, sell out the people who were closest to him. You really think I'm the bad guy here? Alex's voice broke through my thoughts, low and steady.

I did what I had to do to survive. And you, you were too caught up in this fantasy of loyalty and trust. The world's not like that anymore, man. You should know that.

I took a step back, a jolt of disbelief shooting through me. The words stung more than I expected. I hadn't anticipated that he'd be so indifferent, so cold. I thought if I confronted him, if I stood my ground, maybe he'd admit it.

Maybe he'd break down and apologize, maybe he'd even try to justify it. But this... This wasn't what I expected. I can't believe you, I whispered, my voice thick with the bitter taste of hurt and anger. All these years, Alex, I trusted you.

We went through everything together. And now you're telling me it was all just a game to you. He shook his head. His lips curling into a small, almost amused smile.

You really don't get it, do you? He said, stepping closer. You're so wrapped up in your sense of brotherhood that you can't see the bigger picture.

You think I betrayed you? You think I'm the one who ruined this? No. You were the one who couldn't see it coming. I wanted to shout. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him. But my body was frozen in place, like my mind couldn't catch up with the speed of my emotions.

Anger. Hurt. Confusion. They all tangled together in a knot in my chest. For a second, the room felt suffocating. I wanted to say something. Anything that could change the direction of this conversation. I wanted to fight for the friendship we'd had. The trust we'd built over the years. But the words were stuck.

They felt useless. Why Alex? I finally managed. My voice horse. Why would you do this? After everything. He sighed, his gaze softening just for a second, almost as if he were genuinely contemplating my question. You're still not getting it. This whole thing, it was never about you. It was never about us.

It was about survival. And you know what? I'm done pretending. I felt a shiver crawl up my spine. The way he said it, it wasn't just a betrayal of me. It was a betrayal of everything we had ever built together.

It wasn't just about business or loyalty. It was about something deeper, something he'd been hiding for so long. I could feel the walls closing in again. Every word Alex spoke chipped away at everything I thought I knew. I wasn't just angry anymore. I was scared. Scared of what he'd become.

Scared of how easily he had turned on me. But mostly, I was scared of the person I was becoming by standing here, letting him speak this way. What happened to you, man? I muttered, mostly to myself. How did we end up here? Alex's expression shifted again, just slightly. But I saw it.

A flash of something. Maybe regret, maybe bitterness. Maybe a mix of both. But it was fleeting. Just a brief crack in his mask. You really think I had a choice? He asked, almost softly. His voice wasn't as confident now. You think I wanted this? I didn't. But when you're stuck in the middle of it all, you do what you have to do to get out.

And now I'm free. You, on the other hand, He trailed off, looking at me with something that almost seemed like pity. You're still stuck, still playing the game. I shook my head, trying to steady myself, but I was shaking now. Deep down, I could feel my hands trembling. I felt like I was suffocating.

This wasn't the Alex I knew. This wasn't the guy I thought I understood. He wasn't just a friend anymore, he was a stranger. A stranger I couldn't trust. A stranger who had taken everything from me. I turned and walked toward the door.

My mind spinning with thoughts I couldn't piece together. I was done. I needed to get out. I needed air. I needed space. Don't think you can just walk out of here like that. Alex called after me.

His voice low and almost amused, but I didn't stop. Couldn't. I didn't even turn around.

The door slammed shut behind me, and for a split second, I thought I might collapse right there in the hallway. My legs felt like they were made of stone.

My heart was a hammer in my chest, and my mind was still reeling from the conversation. I didn't know what to think anymore. I didn't know how to process any of this.

I didn't know how to live in a world where my best friend, someone I thought I could count on above all others, had just completely shattered everything I believed in. As I stepped into the elevator and the doors closed, I felt the weight of the situation settle into the pit of my stomach.

This wasn't over. Not yet. But I didn't know how I could ever look at him the same way again. The drive home was a blur. I couldn't focus on the road, couldn't hear the hum of the tires against the asphalt.

My hands gripped the wheels so tightly that my knuckles turned white. But even that wasn't enough to distract me from the chaos in my mind.

What just happened? I kept replaying the conversation in my head. over and over again. The things Alex said, the way he acted like everything we'd shared meant nothing. How he looked at me with those cold eyes, as if he'd never once cared about the years we'd spent side by side.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, I was exhausted. Not physically, but mentally. It felt like my brain was running a marathon and had no way of slowing down. I left the car door open as I stepped out",1,1743380946.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing.

A few days ago my best friend got in a car crash but they are okay, nothing broken and they didn‚Äôt even have to go to the hospital. Just some bruises and friction burn they told me. I got their text in class (checked my phone on lunch break) and it really scared me, how I got so close to maybe losing my best friend and they are also my oldest friend. Fuck cars. I am also now extra worried because they have extreme anxiety keeping them from making a lot of progress in learning how to drive and I hope this crash does not push them further into that hole of anxiety. Literally the morning before that happened I was joking about the next time I drive us somewhere just finding somewhere empty and making them practice driving . But we‚Äôll see.

Also I watched a couple of really entertaining movies recently (Abigail 2024- silly but fun, Smile 2 2024-scary but epic, and Host 2020- creative and engaging) so that has been nice. I am trying to catch up on a lot of recent horror movies. I am super open to any movie recommendations by the way, literally any (any language too). I love watching all sorts of movies & docs.

1jnqkw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1jnqkw1/when_did_you_start_to_feel_better_mentally/,When did you start to feel better mentally?,"Hey all, I'm new here and just got floxxed last Tuesday, so I know my body is going to take quite a while to heal, but I'm just curious about other people's experiences. I have the tendinopathy and neuropathy pains, but I honestly can't help stop feeling like I could deal with those if my mental state could just return to normal. 

Firstly, let me give a brief background of what happened. Went in last Sunday with a kidney infection and UTI, was given an IV antibiotic cephtriaxone while there and sent home with CIPRO 2x/day for 7 days. I got through 3 pills before I consulted a secondary urgent care because I was having uncontrollable anxiety, fear/paranoia, rash, among the tendon pain. 

That doctor took me off cipro and prescribed me Augmentin (which already my PCP said is not ever used for kidney infection typically because it isn't usually strong enough to kill kidney infection). But then I found out the next morning that my urinalysis from the second urgent care showed normal (the second urgent care visit was on tuesday), I took the first dose of augmentin that night with no noticeable reactions. But then by the second pill (same with cipro) I started to have uncontrollable anxiety and extreme brain fog/disorientation, that scared me so bad that I eventually became so anxious I lost all sensation in my body and couldn't keep my HR below 120bpm. I went to the ER that night (wed) and they ran every test, bloodwork, urinalysis, xrays etc and had to prescribed me an anxiety med as well. At this point i asked what they thought was going on then if everything is normal, even my WBC was normal indicating that I no longer had an infection. They chalked it up to anxiety from multiple days of being sick, multiple doctor visits, and multiple meds that weren't working and then a bad reaction to cipro. 

So Wednesday 3/26 was the last I had any type of antibiotic. Thursday morning I began taking the azo urinary tract health with probiotic (2x pills per day) and I've been eating clean, I haven't smoked weed or drank coffee since Tuesday and yet I'm still having this awful feeling of being detached from my body and almost feeling high like someone drugged me. I don't feel like myself. I stay home with my son and this is really starting to affect me. Because of the pain from the cipro I can't enjoy walks outside with him like I was nearly daily, I am not drinking coffee for fear it's going to exacerbate my symptoms or God forbid the infection comes back because I didn't finish a full course of antibiotics technically. 

Everything I enjoyed doing I can't do right now. All I've been doing is laying around because even if I do something I just feel so not myself it's depressing me. For those of you that have dealt with this on the extrmee ends, how long did it take before you started to feel like yourself and more mentally clear again? Will this get better? What things did you do to help your specific situation get better? 

I feel like I've been micromanaging every symptom and emotion I'm having to not cause a flare in anxiety which I know can exacerbate the neurological stuff which was so scary for me I don't want to experience it again. 

Also just to ask, do you think I'm at risk for the kidney infection returning soon since I didn't finish the full course and since I'm still feeling this weird mental stuff? I have been peeing clear with no direct uti discomfort since like Tuesday even before the augmentin. No fever or chills have returned to to this point, only things I'm still feeling is the body pains and the mental stuff. I have a follow up with my PCP this Tuesday also which I will ask him too.

 In total though I had: on sunday one antibiotic IV of cephtriaxone, and 1x500mg cipro in the evening. Monday I had 2 cipro 500 mg. Tuesday 1 augmentin. Wednesday 1 augmentin.

I‚Äôll be mostly commuting to work and around my small town. My day will typically look like this: Leave from my house and head to coffee shop (1 mile from my house). Leave coffee shop and head to work (1 mile from coffee shop). Head to lunch and back (2 miles), then home for the day (1 mile from work). 

As you can see, not much distance.  I work at a boat dealership and my attired for work will be sneakers or boat shoes, shorts and a polo. 

I want to ride as safely as possibly but I‚Äôm hoping to not have 3-4 clothes and shoes changes throughout the day.  If that‚Äôs the only way, I‚Äôm hoping there is some easy on/off riding shoes, maybe riding pants I can wear over my shorts, etc.

1jnq82p,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1jnq82p/ive_had_migraines_for_years_and_didnt_even_know_it/,I've had migraines for years and didn't even know it,"Hi, just thought I would share my story on how after years of suffering I finally found out I've been having migraines. I had my first ever migraine in September of 2019 at 18 years old. I was suffering bad from existential anxiety at the time and I had went almost all day that particular day without eating because of how nervous I was. For those wondering, my anxiety is still there but way more manageable. Anyway, I was on the toilet and realized I couldn't read the text on my phone easily, and eventually it got to the point where it looked like objects in my environment were just disappearing! It freaked me out. I thought maybe I just needed some fresh air, so I walked outside and then I started seeing what I now know are called auras. They were jagged and were rainbow colors. I thought I was dying! My mom drove me to urgent care and when I told the medical professional my symptoms, she said it might be a stroke, so my health anxiety set in and I asked for a sick bag and puked in it. The doctor told me to go to the ER where the ER doctor said I was probably just dehydrated.

  
After recovering from that, we fast forward to March of the following year where I drink coffee pretty much for the first time ever. I then start getting the exact same symptoms as I did prior, the auras, aphasia, headache (although I don't always get headaches), postdrome, etc. Except I had no words to describe any of these things! I didn't know what an aura was or postdrome or ANYTHING. I figured this was just something that happened to me occasionally and that's that.

  
Eventually I go almost 2 years without having what at the time I was thinking was maybe low blood sugar (I say maybe because doctors didn't really know what any of it could be due to me just not knowing how to describe any of it) and all of the sudden in September of last year it happens again, but the auras were intense. So, since this was primarily affecting my vision, I called up a local optometrist and scheduled an appointment for the following day. As I was describing all of my symptoms he said, ""Those sound like migraine headaches!"" and I was like ""Oh no, that can't be. You see my head doesn't always hurt and migraines are just headaches"". He then proceeded to educate me on what migraines ACTUALLY are and he made me realize that migraines are not just headaches. Saying that a migraine is ""just a headache"" is like saying ""OCD is being neat and orderly"" It's a misconception.

  
Anyway just wanted to share my story of ignorance in regards to migraines and frustration with most of the doctors I dealt with (which to be fair I wouldn't be surprised if me not getting diagnosed sooner was just me being terrible at explaining my symptoms properly)

  
Now I'm dedicated to telling others in my life that migraines aren't just headaches but can have other symptoms associated with them, especially the aphasia that I suffer with when I have them. I have especially made sure to let my coworkers know so they don't call 911 thinking I'm having a stroke if I have a migraine.",2,1743378875.0,migraine,0,0.75,False
1jnq810,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jnq810/ive_had_the_best_and_the_absolute_worst_in/,I‚Äôve had the best and the absolute worst in polyamory,"I (f44) have been in a polyamorous relationship for the past 7 years with my partners Jeff (m52) and Tee (f45). They had already been together 7 years when I came along. 
Tee and I had known one another for years and had run in the same circle of friends and for the longest and we would always find ourselves connecting at whatever event we were attending. The day I met her partner Jeff we were immediately cool. I am a chef and he was really intrigued by it and wanted to talk more about culinary school etc. We all three started to hang out and needless to say we hit it off and the idea of polyamory was introduced by the both of them. Because of my previous dealings in relationships with men and women I was like why the hell not! I can wholeheartedly say that the time we spent together (both ups and downs) were always new, exciting and really learning experiences. At any given time those experiences could call for self reflection, an apology and sometimes an argument‚Ä¶but it always ended with a conversation and a plan to move forward. 

Jealousy never ever held space in our relationship. Tee is one of THE most loving, caring, understanding and supportive people I have ever known in my entire life. You know the corny saying that someone lights up a room blah blah blah? Well she doesn‚Äôt do that, she lights up people in a room. She makes each individual person in a room feel loved, special and acknowledged‚Ä¶thus lighting up the entire room by lighting up each individual person in said room. Jeff is a typical alpha male (in a good way) by always making us feel safe, protected, loved, cherished and considered. Even his gift giving is top tier as it‚Äôs thoughtful and kind. I have told them both on many occasions how this relationship is the best relationship I have ever been in and I have never felt so loved and considered in ANY relationship I have ever had! 

December 23, 2024 was any other typical day for us. Christmas shopping was done, we were discussing the Christmas lunch/ dinner we would have in a few short days at a coffee shop just enjoying the beautiful day. 
Tee starts to talk funny at the table, Jeff immediately knew something was wrong and I was instantly on the phone with 911. She was rushed to the hospital suffering from a stroke and an immediate craniotomy was performed and she was in ICU for about a week. Once she started to talk and physical therapy began she was downgraded to a regular room as her status wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúintensive‚Äù anymore as she began to feed herself etc. Jeff and I were at that hospital faithfully EVERY day. We were happily waiting on her hand and foot and there was NEVER a moment where she was without at least 1 of us. 
Sadly on January 1 she passed away. 
To try and put into words what I feel and what Jeff has felt over these last few months is just not possible. From that day till now both Tee and my birthday‚Äôs have passed and it has NOT felt like a celebration at any point. Jeff and I are two broken people roaming this earth aimlessly and halfway in a daze. She was LITERALLY our everything. I have lost people that I have dearly loved in this life, but never a person that I CHOSE to love and that CHOSE to love me back‚Ä¶.this loss just hits different. I am scarred for life with this and all I do is replay all the conversations of plans we had, or recalling the silly intimate moments we had together laughing till we cry about the most frivolous of things. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why I am even posting this‚Ä¶.I know in part it‚Äôs because this is how I cope (journaling) but maybe also to add a nugget of hope to all the posters I‚Äôve seen here in the past. 

The ‚Äúperfect‚Äù relationship doesn‚Äôt exist, but maybe the perfect people for YOU do. I‚Äôm thankful I didn‚Äôt realize that fact after losing Tee, but rather while she was here on this plane and I showed her. For knowing her, loving her and being loved by her I am TRULY grateful to the universe, the cruel joke is that I lost her in this physical realm. I do feel her presence so deeply in me that I sometimes speak out loud as if she were sitting right next to me. Because I feel her so close and near to me, that is why I speak of her (when I can) in the present tense because I know she is with me.

I wish you all the very best in whatever type of poly you may prefer‚Ä¶be yourself, express yourself, and most of all give love the way you want to receive it‚Ä¶for there is someone(s) out there waiting on it ‚ù§Ô∏è",25,1743378872.0,polyamory,9,1.0,False

I like talking about almost everything so I doubt we'll run out of conversation topics, but I especially love talking about nerdy stuff like science, video games, and nerdy shows. I frequently read about random stuff on Wikipedia so I might start conversations about some weird octopus species or something.

My main interests are gaming, photography, cooking, baking, astronomy, coffee and basketball. Would love to play games together if you're into it, I'm willing to play pretty much anything but can't guarantee any sort of competency whatsoever. My biggest guilty pleasure is watching weird cringey videos on YouTube and making fun of the people in them, and would love someone to do that with.

So if you wanna talk about stupid random topics, or really deep ones, and flirt in a corny way, hit me up. Also the title isn't clickbait, my parents have a lot of cats and I'll send you pictures. Hope to hear from you.",1,1743378654.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1jnq5dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas_Cowboys/comments/1jnq5dz/hold_the_mayo/,Hold The Mayo,"The Titans will be drafting QB Cameron Ward with the first overall pick.

They have seen enough of Will Levis and will be wanting to dump him in short order much like the Commanders unloaded Sam Howell before bringing in Jayden Daniels.

Does Jerry take a flyer on another young quarterback with potential?

Known for putting mayonnaise in his coffee, Will Levis has many attributes that suggest success in the NFL.

https://preview.redd.it/1agrmoekzwre1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c929795b12c2b68767178ce24a98ab424137381

He comes from a football family as his father played and his great grandfather was an All American and coach.  At 6'4"" 229 with big hands (10 5/8"") and solid athleticism he looks the part.  Recruited to Penn State he eventually made his mash at Kentucky as a transfer.

He was selected in 2023 with the 33rd pick.  His draft grade at the time was 6.34 (Will eventually be plus starter) which is higher than Shedeur Sanders 6.30.

Let's compare some stats for Will (2nd year) and Dak (9th year) in 2024

Passer Rating: Will (81.4) Dak (86.0)

Yards Per Attempt: Will (6.9) Dak (6.9)

INTs: Will (12 in 12 games) Dak (8 in 8 games)

Technically he has more yards (3,899) and TD's in the NFL than Will Grier (228).

Is it not modus operandi for this front office to acquire a player like this?

I have a few questions/observations.,"Saw this/noticed it for the first time while enjoying yesterday's weather.  Looks like it's been there for a while.  This was on the sidewalk and not in any ""private curb/building stoop"" area.  EDIT meant 31st Ave my bad 

  
My questions:

  
\-- I can see why the City wouldn't want people dumping regular trash into it, but making an app to unlock it also feels like a disincentivizer.

\--Serious question:  **Why isn't dog poop listed as an allowed item for the compost bin?**  If you're going to have PUBLIC compost bin, that would seem like an **absolute** no-brainer use scenario.  People who pick up after their dogs either use those little biodegradable bags or newspaper which would I guess come pretty close to ""soiled food packaging"" or similar, and generally have their cell phones on them at all times.  Poop has been used as fertilizer forever and wet newspaper has been used to make planting cups for seedlings and similar forever -- I remember making these as part of a science project way back in elementary school and to this day home gardeners can buy little pressing tools to make seedling cups for starting seeds indoors and planting them, newspaper and all, outside.  My Mom loved to garden and had one of these.

\--Another question:  Are more of these going to pop up as an option as opposed to giving every single business and building a dedicated brown bin, or as a supplemental part of it?  Surprised that there ISN'T one in Athena Park (for example) as people bring food truck stuff and stuff from the bakery all the time.  Those wrappers seem to qualify for composting.

\--Yet another idea:  My building has a garbage chute on each floor.  IF there was a bin ON EACH FLOOR right there in the little chute room (at least in my building there's definitely enough room in the chute room for the bin without obstructing the chute) it would make compliance 10X easier.  THAT'S the kind of setup where people who prep meals every day could just easily gather the scraps on their cutting board/chuck em into their prep bowl after they're done, take a few steps out, and chuck it in the bin rather than having to have a closed container and get to the basement on the regular.  Yes, it would be a hassle for the super to bring up and down--we have 6 floors.  BUT if the building had biodegradable liners for said brown bins, the super can chuck them down the chute and then put THOSE in the ""compost pickup area"" on pickup days (or even leave extra liners on the handle of the brown bin -- our building is pretty tight-knit and people WOULD swap out the bag and drop the full one down for him).  It would all have to be schlepped to the curb by him or one of his guys anyway, and having one dinky little brown bin for a big building ain't gonna work if people actually use it at the rules intended.  Almost EVERYONE in my building cooks -- you can smell something nice going on in the hallways from dusk until late at night depending on people's schedules.  The cost of the liners could be rolled in to the building maintenance fees if need be.  

  
Thoughts?  I have actually read through others' responses to the issue and while I still feel that it's a regressive law, if the City is serious about it they should at least make the effort to make it work.

1jnpqzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jnpqzy/love_help/,Love help!,"I once talked to a girl, and nothing came of it. A while later, we picked things up again and started dating. After about seven dates (dating for around 2 months), things went quiet. 

It went quiet because I kind of pulled away after she did something that I didn‚Äôt like, and because of that, I kind of ghosted her.

What I think it was for her is that she didn‚Äôt want to tell her parents that she was dating. We went to out for coffee, shopping etc. about five times, we went glow golfing once, and we also studied together for a test once. I really enjoyed doing these things.

But what made it difficult was that when I suggested coming over to my place to watch a movie or to do something fun, she always reacted vaguely. What made me pull away was when I walked with her to her house because she had forgotten something and wanted to pick it up.
When we arrived at her house, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go inside; I had to wait behind the fence. I ended up standing there for 15 minutes.

I know this sounds like hell but I really liked here and I think she liked me too. And before I ghosted her she asked me to hang out again but I was to two minded about if I liked her or if I was just a activity for her.
How should I try to restart contact with her? Should I follow her on Instagram, add her on Snapchat, just talk to her in person or if I should even make contact again with her. It has been like 5 months since the last time we spoke.

Early last week when I got to my car to drive to work my tire was surprise flat because I‚Äôd apparently driven over a nail, spent a bunch on Lyfts and a new tire. Then I got sick for the second time in a few weeks somehow. Friday I spilled coffee all over my desk/work laptop first thing in the morning, spilled soda in a way that just perfectly looked like I peed my pants later in the afternoon. Woke up in a weird mood today and drove to the corner store to get some snacks to cheer myself up and somehow popped ANOTHER tire by bumping into a curb in the <5 minute drive home. Will need to fix it tomorrow because I drive around a lot for work. Tried to open my curtains just now because I‚Äôd made the house all dark to sulk and was feeling better; curtain immediately ripped.

I had a full course load, a part-time job, and personal stuff going on. I told myself I‚Äôd manage, but then I had three papers due in the same week, plus a midterm I barely studied for.

I pulled two all-nighters, chugged way too much coffee, and somehow finished my papers‚Äîbut the quality was terrible, and I barely passed. Meanwhile, my midterm? Complete disaster. That‚Äôs when I realized something: *I wasn‚Äôt learning‚ÄîI was just surviving.*

A friend told me about EssayShark, where you can connect with expert writers for help. At first, I thought using a service like that felt like ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù but after trying it, I saw it differently. I used it to get help structuring my papers, refining my ideas, and making my arguments stronger. The difference? Instead of just turning in rushed, low-quality work, I actually understood the material better.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîhow do you handle overwhelming workloads?

* Have you ever hit a point where you felt like no matter what you did, it wasn‚Äôt enough?
* Do you think tools like this actually help students, or do they make them too dependent?
* What‚Äôs your go-to strategy when schoolwork piles up?

1jnpo71,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnpo71,The Fall of Citron,"As many of you know there has been much drama in the Citron scene over the past few days, much more so over the past 24 hours. This will be a complete guide to raise awareness of the situation for people who still have questions. 

As many of you know about 5 days ago Citrons discord went private, unless you used an external verification app in the Switch homebrew of your modded switch.14,000 users less than 48 hours ago were purged and blacklisted from the Citron discord with no warning or reason given. Many of whom had already completed the verification steps with their modded switch. During the purge many moderators were purged aswell, and some moderators, specifically Greemdev, were very trigger happy to ban anyone who they wanted, just for fun. If you said anything they didn't like, or ""annoyed"" them, instant permaban. This was seen as immature and toxic, and helped escalate the ruin of Citron as a whole. 

Many were skeptical of using this app because of the security concerns of handing over their Switches drm files to an unknown source for ""verification"" that you have broken Nintendos rules and modded your switch. Aswell as the power that someone would have with thousands of these people's specific switch identifiers. If gotten into the wrong hands (you know who) your switch could be bricked without warning. These fears would turn out to be justified in many regards apparently, In recent leaks from the Citron Mod channel Zephyron was planning in implementing a DRM locking feature that would make it so you could not use Citron unless you had externally verified that you had broken Nintendos terms of service, aswell as keeping a DATABASE of your Switch specific tokens and keys, making it so that even if you Uninstalled Citron you would be blacklisted from the app. This gives Zephyron too much power to pick and choose who gets to use the app aswell as creates large security concerns. 

I am not involved in this drama whatsoever. None of these are firsthand accounts and there will be MANY missing things here, i am just an onlooker who thinks you guys need to know. But I will give to the best of my ability the many complains that have been raised. 

Zephyron (the ""lead developer"" for Citron) have been found to be the same person from the Uzuy incident that used to be called Phoenix, many issues relating to them include a serious allegation of being a pedo, code stealing, harassing Jarrod (Sudachi emulator dev) and overall lying to the people backing up Uzuy. This led to the Sudachi dev leaving the scene in October of 2024 from harassment by Zephyron specifically or other people repeating the things Zephyron was saying(who was Phoenix at this point in time). So Zephyron abandoned Uzuy after it crashed and burned and relabeled himself as Zephyon, and Uzuy as Citron. Is will mention that the only reason these specific details are know is because Zephyron was not the lead developer for Uzuy either. Camille was. Again. So he was there the entire time doing all of the work with Zephyron/Phoenix taking the credit aswell. Camille also helped with the rebranding into Citron. Camille never had a problem with not being given credit for all of their work, they just wanted to help the community. Everything was fine until February of this year when Camille started engaging more with the community on their role with Citron and being more involved with the users actively around the time their Turnip Driver Biosensor was released, and recieved widely praised reviews on at the time. This cause Zepyron to act more hostile towards Camille feeling that the credit/attention was being taken from them. 

Around this time Zephyron started making calls between the moderators when Camille was not online or behind his back in general, remember this was started between Zeph and Camille only as partners and now Zeph is making changes and communications specifically trying to hide them from Camille. Zeph started become more hostile towards Camille and lashed out or insulted Camille unwarranted on multiple occasions to make Camille look bad to other users or the moderators. This was directly after the release of 0.4 Citron which many consider to be the last truly stable build of Citron. 

Zephyron release 0.5 without properly testing all of the new implimentations from Camille (and it shows, it broke allot of amd users experience aswell as didn't not show much progression vs 0.4 in general, usually regression) At this time Camille opened an account to receive donations for new hardware for testing. This is the straw that broke the camels back. Without communication Zephyron had hired a lawyer and sent a Cease and Desist to Camille, revoking all moderator privileges on Github and Discord until Camille took down their ""Buy Me A Coffee"" link for donations, aswell as unfriending them. (From my opinion Zeph was trying to kick out Camille anyways was just looking for an excuse) Camille hired a lawyer who communicated that the Cease and Desist had no grounds and that he had done nothing wrong. Zephyron apologized realizing they had no power, and instead sent 100$ to Camilles buy me a coffee as an apology and offering to lend/gift(not sure) them a ROG Ally Z1 Extreme to further testing of Citron. But there was a catch, they would only get the ROG Ally if they signed an NDA to become an Administrator in the channel again. Camille took this NDA to their lawyer who strongly reccomended against it. As it meant Camille could never speak about what is going on in Citron to anyone. Such as all of this. When Camille did not sign the NDA Zephyron reported Camilles buy me a coffee and got it shut down, aswell as their 100$ were refunded back them, and all previous donations. In this time Zeph released 0.6 and 0.61 without much help from Camille(the reason why they were broken and didn't help anyone except for the multiplayer that wasn't even developed by Zeph, just implemented copy and paste from someone else's code. Again.) Kleidis wrote the code for multiplayer and was not given the proper credit. 

Citrons Github has been reset and all contributions from Camille have been removed. Do not expect a proper update anytime soon as all of the progress you guys have appreciated has been removed and I doubt the app even works anymore in its current github state. Zeph has unofficially said Citron is dead I beleive? But that is from word of mouth, I have not seen it. 

All other stuff in this post has been verified by me and over 100 other people in many screenshot. This is not word of mouth. There is proof for every single thing mentioned so far. 


This will be the second emulator to crash and burn under Zeph/Phoenix's command. 

Basically Camille and Zephyron started Citron together, and it was supposed to be a sort of partnership. But how it really worked was Camille did all of the work, and Zephron was the one to copy and paste the new code into Github. But Zephron took credit for all of the work, and would get upset if Camille was given credit by users for his work. There are many screenshot of Camille sending their work to Zeph and having them implement it, yet Camille was never given credit for it until Camille fought and fought for their credit on the Github. 

Moving forward Camille will be releasing their own Switch fork soon with multiple other competent devs including the Uzuy and Yuzu Mod dev who had made tremendous strides in the Switch space, NONE of the new devs were involved in the Uzuy crash except who Camille who was the only reason Uzuy existed in the first place but had no control on how it was managed. I know it looks rough, at this exact moment but Switch emulation is not dead, far from it. And we have now cut all the wheat from the chaff and should be excited for the future ahead. The new fork will be called Eden and the discord will be up soon hopefully. I hope to all see you there.

I've lurked the subreddit and will continue to do so but wanted to post our specific iternary and am looking for info. We are arriving Haneda from NYC, 32F and 37M. We've travelled internationally to Europe but first time to Asia. We love to eat/drink, hike, be in nature, and would be interested in some mueseus/history/art. For food, we are mostly planning to plot things on Google Maps but otherwise be spontaneous based on where we are or what we are feeling like, but we'd happy take recommendations to add to the map. We also want to visit many coffee shops and want to shop some but are thinking that clothes won't fit us much (we are 5'10"" and 6'1"" respectively). We want to go to Pokemon/Ghibili/Nintendo shops. We aren't really into anime as much and nothing with animals. 

  
May 17 - Arrive Haneda at 1:00 PM and transit to airport in Ueno. Might try to walk in Asujasa/Senso-ji that night to stave off the jet lag. Maybe Ueno Park depending on how we are feeling, we are staying very close to Ueno Park. 

May 18 - Thinking about Shibuya/Shinjuku during the day, Tokyo Municipal Building. Possible Tokyo Giants Game at 2:00 and then back to hotel for a rest before going back to Shibuya/Shinjuku for the evening.

May 19 - May need to do some luggage forwarding this day. Ueno Park in the AM, Kappabashi Street, maybe Akihabara in the morning. We are thinking of attending the Sumo Tournament in the afternoon and stopping by the Hakusai Museum right down the street.

May 20 - Checkout of hotel, maybe Ginza, take shinkansen / train to Nakatsugawa. Any recs for dinner in Nagoya?

May 21 - Train to Nagiso to hike down to Magome via the Nakasendo Trail. We will do laundry this evening.

May 22 - Transit to Nagoya with eventual goal to be in Otsu for our ryokan stay by 3:00. We are feeling its not worth it to be in Kyoto for just a few hours. Looking for recs here - do we spend a couple hours in Nagoya, go straight to Otsu and be around Lake Biwa, or go to Kyoto and get lunch??

May 23 - Leave the Ryokan in the AM and go to Kyoto for the day. I've mapped a few things in Gion. Planning to stay until after dinner and head to our hotel on Osaka

May 24 - Osaka - haven't fleshed this out much. We would also like to be open to go back to Kyoto at least one evening. 

May 25 - Osaka

May 26 - Check out of Osaka and transit back to Haneda, arriving at the airport by 2:00.

Charlotte, your videos are a gift to this chaotic world‚Äîthey never fail to bring joy. Please, you and Mike, never lose that magic!

Anyways, buckle up because my best friend, Sun and I have one hell of a story for you‚Äîan intuition we both had that turned out to be dead on (and then some). It‚Äôs a wild ride, so get comfy.

For privacy reasons, all names have been changed, and I‚Äôm posting this from a throwaway. Also, in case its impoetant we are all in our early to mid 20s. Let‚Äôs get into it!

So, let me tell you about Briony. She‚Äôs a mutual friend within our group, but much closer to our other three friends amd had known them at least a year longer‚ÄîKatherine, Agatha , and Daisy. I didn‚Äôt meet her until about eight months ago when she joined a coffee study session with Katherine and me. And from the very first moment, something was just off about her.

I have a pretty solid track record when it comes to reading people, and Briony set off all my internal alarms. She wasted no time launching into a very detailed and dramatic sob story about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her ex, Robbie. Now, I don‚Äôt want to sound heartless, but unloading something that heavy onto a total stranger within the first five minutes of meeting? It felt weird. Uncomfortable. Almost calculated.

But the real kicker? She claimed she had been offered a fully funded PhD but rejected it. That struck me as total nonsense for several reasons:

1. She was applying for a PhD in English, and at our university, no fully funded projects had been offered for that subject the year she applied or this year.

2. She had a 2:2 in her undergraduate degree and no Master‚Äôs‚Äîwhich is a huge barrier to both getting an offer (most places require a 2:1 or experience in place) and funding.

3. She chose to do a teaching postgrad instead because they told her she ‚Äúneeded teaching experience‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt how academia works, tesching experience isnt required, though any teaching experience within the university such as helping teach tutorials will make big changes to funding).

At the time, I was in the process of applying for PhDs myself, so I knew she was talking nonsense. I relayed the whole interaction to Sun, and she agreed it was strange, but we decided to let it go.

Until Katherine‚Äôs birthday in February.

Katherine planned a fun night‚Äîcocktails followed by mini golf. She invited the usual group, including Briony. From the moment we sat down, Briony was glued to her phone, ranting about how university accommodation security was supposedly making false reports against her for watching an inappropriate movie and were threatening to revoke her contact. The whole thing sounded sketchy. But the real moment that sealed it for Sun and me?

Halfway through drinks, Briony dramatically declared that she couldn‚Äôt join us for mini golf because security had just called her and demanded she return immediately to deal with the report‚Äîat 7 PM on a Friday.

Sun and I exchanged a look. Something about the whole situation just didn‚Äôt add up. But, again, we let it go and chalked it up to her being rude and maybe a bit of a drama queen.

That was, until last week.

Sun, while visiting her cousin who had recently moved for work, met one of her housemates‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Honey‚Äîwho happened to know Robbie back when he and Briony were dating. And oh boy, did she have some tea to spill.

Turns out, Briony is not just a liar‚Äîshe‚Äôs an actual narcissist. Almost everything she had told us was completely fabricated to gain sympathy.

Robbie had never abused her. In fact, she had been the abuser. And not just emotional‚Äîthings had escalated to the point where it was serious (I won‚Äôt go into detail because that‚Äôs his private life, but trust me, it was bad).

Her current boyfriend, Ivan, had been harassing Robbie over the false accusations, including trying to get him fried at work by staging a scene in his work place.

The whole ‚Äúsecurity is out to get me‚Äù situation? Highly likely to be fake. While she does have some issues with the kitchen (mainly mould which nearly every student cam relate to) there aren't likley any reports against her. In fact, the whole ""my living situation is ruining my life"" is a card she has played before around three years ago when she apparently had lost a rental she had been offered and paid for, only regained after she kicked up a storm and threaten to sue the landlord (she never paid the deposit and lost the contract as a result.)

The ‚ÄúPhD offer‚Äù? Never happened. She never even applied for one. Her actual goal is to be a lecturer, but she doesn‚Äôt have the qualifications yet. She was offered a Master‚Äôs, but she chose the PGCE instead to gain teaching experience. 

And oh yeah‚Äîshe‚Äôs been cheating on every single boyfriend she‚Äôs had. And not just with single guys‚Äîshe actively goes after married men and men in relationships.

Sun and I were floored. Our intuition had been 100% on point, but even we hadn‚Äôt expected it to be this bad.

Now, obviously, we want to tell the rest of the girls in our friend group. They deserve to know who they‚Äôre really dealing with and make their own choices. But we also know that exposing Briony comes with consequences‚ÄîSun and I could lose friends if we don‚Äôt play this carefully.

Luckily, I am a very petty yet very strategic person. I also have firsthand experience dealing with narcissists and pathological liars, so I know exactly how to play this game.

The plan?

1. Slowly gather concrete evidence. I already have most of what we need regarding the PhD and her past relationships. We‚Äôre just waiting to compile it all into an airtight case.

2. Let Briony trap herself. Narcissists hate when people poke holes in their lies, so every time she brings up these topics, I‚Äôll ask small, leading questions. I‚Äôll subtly correct her mistakes, watching as she builds up her own contradictions until she gets caught in the web.

3. Wait for the perfect moment. When she inevitably self-destructs, we‚Äôll be ready to drop the truth in one swift, undeniable blow.

4. Let karma do its work.

If any of you petty potatoes have suggestions for how else I can move in the shadows, please let me know. I open to anything as long as it's legal. 

Otherwise, I will do my best to keep you updated.",16,1743376630.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.91,False

I'm wide awake at past midnight as always, and looking to meet someone I can build a long lasting romantic connection with. 

I'm shy and introverted, so meeting people is difficult, but I talk a lot once I open up to you and I make a lot of stupid jokes, like really a lot of stupid jokes. I like talking about almost everything so I doubt we'll run out of conversation topics, but I especially love talking about nerdy stuff like science, video games, and nerdy shows. I frequently read about random stuff on Wikipedia so I might start conversations about some weird octopus species or something. 

My main interests are gaming, photography, cooking, baking, astronomy, coffee and basketball. Would love to play games together if you're into it, I'm willing to play pretty much anything but can't guarantee any sort of competency whatsoever. My biggest guilty pleasure is watching weird cringey videos on YouTube and making fun of the people in them, and would love someone to do that with. 

So if you wanna talk about stupid random topics, or really deep ones, and flirt in a corny way, hit me up. Also the title isn't clickbait, my parents have a lot of cats and I'll send you pictures. Hope to hear from you.",0,1743376466.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I've watched James Hoffman's comparison video from 2020 (which wasn't particularly conclusive) and have seen/read a bunch of other opinions, but interested in the real users that exist here.

* Non-pressurised 58mm basket ideal but not a deal breaker (Looking at you, Lelit Anna)
* Happy to go full manual but some convenience/automation would be nice but again not a deal breaker
* Mostly used for espresso/long black but will occasionally make lattes
* I'm usually making two coffees at a time; twice a day.
* Current workflow is 2x Aeropress; will probably still use them occasionally but looking to up my game and improve the experience
* I live around the corner from a coffee roaster so fresh beans isn't an issue!
* I have an un-modified SJ
* I was considering a Ninja Cafe Luxe but I really don't want to get an all-in-one product which will fail in 2 years and be a pain to service.

I think that's all the detail you need. About the SJ:

* I want to make it doserless/single dose. However, I cannot source the bellows/chute in the UK. Any UK users got a good source for these mods?
* Are there any other upgrades worth bothering with? I was initially thinking of flipping it for a DF64 but searches on here indicate its not worth it - especially as my SJ was a gift and hasn't cost me a penny.
* Changing the grind size is really difficult -  the dial on the top is hard to move. Is something wrong with it?

1jnpdsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jnpdsi/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/,AITA for not wanting to go to my brothers wedding,"This might be long and a little all over the place but bear with me. For context, I am in my early 20's, and my family/siblings are early 30's.

Keep all this in mind before reading ahead; my family is controlling and wants everything their way or no way, things get ran through my brother and if it doesn‚Äôt make them happy it‚Äôs not right. Also everyone is always pleasing the decisions of my mom to satisfy her and plays victim by saying we don‚Äôt understand her feelings Not that it should matter but my family is Hispanic so if you know how they are then you can see where I come from.

To start this all happened at the start of 2023, so it's been a bit. In the beginning of 2023, I started talking to this guy I went to high school with but then we were never really close but knew of each other. At the start of this, he was 23 (now 25M) and I was 20 (now 22F turning 23 in october). We had started talking and getting to know each other which was nice at the start until family got involved...

We got to talking started to know each other and all then we eventually started dating. Keep in mind I am in college at this time so of course I am going to doing college stuff lol. To start I had been seeing him for around 2 months just being friends and seeing where things go until i started to get questioned by my brother. Lets call him George, at the time he was 27 (29 now) got involved by asking me why i was going to this certain place a lot. He had my location for a while as any sibling would but I never would have thought it would be used to see where I was going being the age I was. I ended up lying as to where because I didnt want him in my business right away and I didn't want to share that I was with someone just yet because it was too soon and I know how my family is when meeting someone. They are very judgmental right off the bat without knowing them.

So eventually it had gotten out of control when one day my bf and I went on a night walk in our hometown street where there was a bunch of small coffee shops, bars, etc, then we ended up passing by the gym that my brother was in at the time and he randomly texted me saying ""you did not just walk by me and not say hi""... excuse me, I am not going to go into the gym to interrupt your workout. So we then continued walking to mind our own business then this happened‚Ä¶ tell me why he instantly got in his car and DROVE UP ON US!!! Literally not even 5 minutes of seeing him he was already right there. Mind you this was the first time he‚Äôs ever seen my bf so obviously I was a bit nervous and so was he. George ended up starting conversation by literally saying ‚Äúwho the f*** are you‚Äù right off the bat!!! I was not expecting that at all but being nice and very caught off guard my bf introduced himself then my brother started questioning him about where he worked, how long he‚Äôs worked there and more. After that happened we just continued our walk and i instantly apologized because like what was that?! It then continues, I ended up going to my brothers and didn‚Äôt think anything of it right? Well I was wrong he found just the right moment to ask me these questions about who I was seeing and everything but me I‚Äôm such a big people please I told him just someone because I felt like I needed to give an answer but that was the worst mistake. He took that as a lead to start ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù him because a few months later he knew where he lived, what apartment number and what apartment building he was in but I will come back to that, crazy I know!!

After that encounter of seeing him on the walk everything was ok until George started to do some digging into my bfs past and everything which I still question myself how he knew everything but never got a clear answer. Anyway, he started telling me he was a bad person, he burned bridges with many people and the list goes on even to call him a narcissist which I don‚Äôt see. After he told me all that I started to second guess myself who this person was and everything but I just let time tell but I should‚Äôve stopped having him get involved right there and then and I unfortunately didn‚Äôt. It got to the point where we ended up actually breaking up because my brother told me to and I listened. We ended up ending things and it hurt so much that when we did we couldn‚Äôt believe it happened because I decided to listen to my brother. I ended it and then a month later or so after we got back together because it wasn‚Äôt right to end things because someone told me to. Getting back together was what fueled the situation even more!! It got to be where my mom got involved and my brother‚Äôs fianc√© let‚Äôs call her Marie (22 at the time 25 now). Don‚Äôt get me started on her lol. Shes been around for a while since her and my brother have been together for 8 years getting married this summer.

Both my mom and his fianc√© got involved because they were getting told what was happening from my brother. Keep this in mind, this has all been happening while being a full time college student at a new school and first semester since I transferred. As it went on I was struggling with school because I was getting calls and texts left and right from absolutely everyone saying how I wrong in the situation, that I was with the wrong person and all that. Remember when I said I didn‚Äôt want my around because it was too soon? Well they decided to take it into their own hands to deal with by saying I couldn‚Äôt see him until he came around my family but I say I wasn‚Äôt comfortable enough yet because we were still getting to know each other and that was within the first 2 months of us seeing each other. I told them I wasn‚Äôt ready and they said it wasn‚Äôt my choice. So here comes more. I stayed the night at my bfs for the weekend because we just wanted to have a night together right, tell me why I got to my house and my brother was there and approached us AGAIN!! He told my bf he wanted to talked he asked about what and all he was it‚Äôs personal, and then he told ME to go inside as if I did something wrong. They were talking for about 3 hours and I know nothing about what they talked about because I never got told other than my bf saying to give us at least 3 months and he would but then it took a turn because my brother decided to do more‚Ä¶..

He got my mom involved by telling her what I was doing where I was going absolutely everything!! Then I started getting calls and texts from my mom saying all sorts of stuff to where it drained me so bad it affected my schooling that I had to take a gap year. Throughout it all my bf eventually met my sister who I‚Äôm living with (mom and dad I don‚Äôt live with) dad lives out of the country, mom moved down there and visits here. I‚Äôve been living with my sister for a few years so when it comes to me leaving the house to go anywhere I tell her but for them it‚Äôs not good enough, I get told ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not your mom, I am‚Äù and it‚Äôs been like that sense. Back to how they got involved. So my brother goes and tells me mom about the concerns he has, she then comes to tell me about stuff and I try explaining my part but no she takes his side and blames me and my bf for everything going on. They said he had to meet a sibling of mine and he met my sister and her fianc√© right? Tell me why when they get asked about him they say absolutely nothing to my mom of how he is as a person, then he ended up coming over for dinner just to get to know them a little more and even then they didn‚Äôt make conversation with him. He was the one asking questions and after dinner they proceeded to go to their room and not interact with him so that‚Äôs twice now that he‚Äôs tried to get to know some family, but guess what‚Ä¶.. that wasn‚Äôt enough!!ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I had numerous conversations with my family about how they were treating me and him but they didn‚Äôt care. He went as far as talking to my brothers fianc√© Marie about how my family was to get to know them even more since at that time she would‚Äôve been with my brother for 6 years so she‚Äôs been around. THIS is where everything took a turn and went even more downhill from here. We went to a coffee shop, her, me and my bf talked about my family he asked questions and she agreed with almost everything he had said but then when she went back home she told my brother the complete opposite saying that my bf brainwashed her with what he said and we were talking for about 2 hours. How in the world can you do that in 2 hours?!!!! Also how I didn‚Äôt stick up for my mom because my bf said that my mom‚Äôs parenting shouldn‚Äôt come from what had happened to her when she was younger. But I had nothing to say because I didn‚Äôt even know what had happened until I got told a few months ago. At this point my bf and I were very much to the point where we were going to end things completely and not talk to each other anymore because it was driving us apart more and more but we stuck it through and kept talking. While in the mix of everything I had met his mom and went over a few times but it wasn‚Äôt until that also became an issue because they thought he didn‚Äôt want to come around my family and I was choosing him over them but I wasn‚Äôt. Every conversation I had with my family was all negative it got to the point where I got told I was failing them as a daughter and that I was like a little dog listening to its owner. They said that because whenever he came to pick me up he wouldn‚Äôt come to the door, i would just go outside. They called me names, saying I was just going there to do the ‚Äúthing‚Äù which was not the case. I would go with him because I wasn‚Äôt around them and felt at peace which they had a problem with

This next part is when my mom came home to see us and to meet my bf because she didn‚Äôt want to do it over FaceTime but said she wanted to meet him. She asked about going to dinner I said it was fine but my bf was hesitant because of what‚Äôs been happening but he went anyway. I asked her if it could just be us and her but guess who showed up‚Ä¶ my brother. As soon as he walked through the door I knew it was over. My mom asked us what was going on so we were explaining it to her but George was budding in every chance he got and the conversation went nowhere because they made me cry and at the very end my brother called my bf a pos and we left. I felt so bad that the car ride back was complete silence and when I hugged my bf he started crying saying ‚ÄúI tried everything‚Äù every since then he has not see my family besides this one last time. The final time he had seen them was when George and my mom followed us to his mom‚Äôs house!! Now let me explain. Him and I had ended up going to his moms for dinner since invited us, while I was there my mom texted me saying ‚Äúwow I come all the way here just for you to go there‚Äù at the time it hurt that she said that looking at it now it was to make me feel bad. But back to what happened. We had left his moms after dinner and we started driving, tell me why we ended up at the same intersection as my brother and mom. My bf kept driving and we didn‚Äôt think anything of it until the car kept getting closer and closer, then we instantly knew we were being followed so we decided to go back to his moms. During that the cops got called because of the previous events so we eventually got back and they told us they were just getting gas!! Like no and they said they just wanted to talk but it was 9 at night which I then said was late and it could be another day. Now that was the very last time he had seen my mom and brother and same with the rest of my family. My other siblings weren‚Äôt involved so they aren‚Äôt mentioned

Last part. Ever since then my family hasn‚Äôt approved of him and he wants nothing to do with my family ever again even it leads to him and I being together in the future with a family of our own. Now I‚Äôm stuck to where I cut them off or keep them a distance. I‚Äôm a very family oriented person but true colors showed within the last few years of if it‚Äôs not about them they don‚Äôt care and will do anything they can to make it harder.

I'm sure some of you, if not many of you, remember a little website called GameHippo. It was a site dedicated to Freeware games. It was the era of dial-up, and I would scour the site for games that were ""playable"" and by that I mean - a game with a less than 3Mb file size (so should be successfully downloaded without issue most of the time), was ""simple"" (translation: it would run on my potato Pentium 133Mhz PC), and of course, looks fun. I recall games such as Chain Reaction, N, and Porrasturvat (a game where you push a ragdoll down some steps to cause as much damage to it as possible).

I remember stumbling across a point-and-click puzzle adventure game that was no doubt inspired by, if not directly based on, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This is where the memory gets vague - our hero is a feckless, scruffy, sarcastic, irreverent layabout who is (I think) awakened by something alien, perhaps an abduction or a crashed ship near his home, or something hitting his home, a meteor? It's an opening similar, in some way, to the first sequence of Earthbound, in terms of tone. At least, I THINK this is how it opened.

Once awakened, our character's first goal is to find breakfast, or possibly sugar for his coffee, or maybe something to go with the coffee? Cream? Milk? Donut? Maybe he was looking for the remote for his TV? It was something simple, something that was needed so he could go on with his layabout activities.

Despite this simple goal, the seeking of this leads our character to an adventure that goes from one extreme to the next. One minute our boy is looking for a simple item and then ends up embroiled in some insane adventure that involves aliens, or possibly the destruction of Earth?

Our hero wore a green bathrobe and slippers, and never changed out of it, and if I'm not misremembering, had his coffee cup in his hand permanently. It was your classic use X item on Y thing to get Z item/thing or to move on to the next chapter, scene, or just simply the next area or room kinda deal.

You navigated by clicking on an area with a white aiming reticle, and our hero would meander here and there. The game began in our hero's home, or possibly town and would eventually move to the final chapter, which took place on a spaceship, where we would communicate with a cycloptic alien being that was very critical of our hero, and overall, of humans. I never finished it, so I assume this was the final chapter.

Welp, I hope this is enough information to help track this game down. Quite the white whale of a game, I never finished it, and I would love to see if adult me can.",3,1743376010.0,tipofmyjoystick,8,1.0,False

1jnp8aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaresworthpaying/comments/1jnp8aq/microsoft_365_review_is_it_worth_the_subscription/,Microsoft 365 Review: Is It Worth the Subscription?,"Let me start by saying this: I‚Äôve been using Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) for¬†*years*, both for work and personal stuff, and honestly? It‚Äôs become as essential as my morning coffee. But is it worth paying for? Let‚Äôs break it down.

**First, the Basics:**  
For around¬†100$ /year (or around 10$ /month), you get the full Office suite‚ÄîWord, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, plus newer apps like Teams and OneNote. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs not just about the apps. You also get 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage¬†*per person*¬†(hello, photo backups and endless cat videos), 60 minutes of Skype calls monthly, and advanced security features like ransomware detection. If you‚Äôre sharing a Family plan ($10/month for up to 6 people), that‚Äôs a¬†*lot*¬†of value packed in.

**Why I Keep Paying:**

* **Always Updated:**¬†No more waiting years for the next Office version. Features like real-time collaboration in Word or Excel‚Äôs¬†*mind-blowing*¬†new formulas (XLOOKUP, anyone?) roll out automatically.
* **Work From Anywhere:**¬†I can edit a document on my laptop, tweak it on my phone during a commute, and present it via PowerPoint Online‚Äîall synced effortlessly.
* **OneDrive Saves Lives:**¬†Seriously, I‚Äôve recovered ‚Äúdeleted‚Äù files more times than I‚Äôd like to admit. The peace of mind alone is worth part of the subscription.
* **Teams & Family Sharing:**¬†My household uses the Family plan to share calendars, storage, and even a shared Excel budget sheet (adulting, am I right?). Teams keeps my remote workgroup sane with chat, video calls, and file sharing.

**The Annoyances (Because Nothing‚Äôs Perfect):**

* **Subscription Fatigue:**¬†I miss the days of buying software once. If you‚Äôre tight on cash, the annual fee might sting, especially if you only need Word occasionally.
* **Overkill for Some:**¬†If you just need basic docs or spreadsheets, free tools like Google Workspace or LibreOffice could work. But you‚Äôll miss out on premium templates, advanced editing, and that sweet, sweet OneDrive storage.
* **Occasional Update Glitches:**¬†Every few months, an update might temporarily break a feature I rely on. Nothing catastrophic, but mildly irritating.

**Final Take:**  
If you‚Äôre a student, a remote worker, a freelancer, or just someone juggling multiple devices and collaborators, Microsoft 365 is a no-brainer. The convenience, cloud integration, and constant upgrades make the subscription feel justified. But if you‚Äôre a casual user who fires up Word twice a year? Maybe stick with the free alternatives (Google Docs FTW).

For me, though, the ability to work seamlessly across devices, share effortlessly with my team, and never worry about losing files has made Microsoft 365 a tool I‚Äôm happy to pay for. It‚Äôs like having a digital Swiss Army knife‚Äîpricey, but worth it when you need it¬†*every. single. day.*

        1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Carlin Stewart has a new home away from home-her bathroom and the mirror hanging there.¬† She has logged several hours in front of it over the last few weeks, hard at work slinging links for any and everything she can find.¬† She has zero brand loyalty and will sell you anything while wearing her $150 robe from Macy‚Äôs.¬† Layla, clad in her ever present tutu, joins mom in the sales center bathroom to apply a full face of makeup while making kissy faces and walking out to show dad swinging her hips like she‚Äôs an early 90s fly girl.¬† After teasing their I Love You Day vlog for several days, it finally drops on YouTube and we see Carlin walking around a boot store with Zade on her hip while she tells us that they are here to buy Warden a gift for the party.¬† Trace comes along to help out bc Evan is decked out in LuLuLemon and lost as a coot.¬† They want to buy Warden 2 pairs of $200 boots, but Trace talks them into a hat and just one pair, plus Carlin has been to the Buckle and picked him up some new skinny jeans.¬† Carlin and Evan dress in the same exact outfit‚Ä¶ a sweat suit from a Christian basketball player that is sponsoring this vlog.¬† As a side note Candace Owens is constantly in this same gear, so it‚Äôs obviously trash. The second vlog sponsor is the local dude who wrapped their Tesla and Evan attempts to wash the car while promoting the wrap job. Evan is allergic to manual labor, so he ends up throwing some water on it, and pretending to vacuum.¬† Layla and Zade are forced to dress up as Lucy and Ricky for the 50s themed ILY day party and while Layla‚Äôs costume is perfection, Zade has to wear an Elvis wig that Carlin cuts the sideburns off of.¬† The Stew Crew keep saying the party is ‚Äúlaid back and chill‚Äù this year which is code for ‚Äúa bunch of my siblings didn‚Äôt want to come‚Äù.¬† Warden wins the biggest heart award and Evan wins the most annoying in law award for the 9th year running.¬† Dude cannot shut up while Kelly Jo announces things and his running commentary is beyond obnoxious.¬† Carlin drew Josie‚Äôs name and gifted her headphones, Zach had Evan‚Äôs name and Addee drew Carlin‚Äôs name and gifted her a head replacement‚Ä¶.no, I mean head massage.¬† Layla won first place in the costume contest and Michael screams into her sewing machine.¬† Layla had no days off this past week and has to film a Target shopping trip.¬† She mumbles her way through picking out a gift for her brother‚Äôs birthday and Carlin makes a big deal over her spending her ‚Äúown‚Äù money to buy it. Layla should have been the one handing a few dollars over to Carlin and filming her making her choice bc it‚Äôs ALL Layla‚Äôs money.¬† Kelly Jo comes over to the studio to make chili with the kids.¬† Carlin says she is craving the chili from her childhood, and to keep it real, KJ buys everything store brand generic and makes enough for 63 firemen.¬† Zade turns 3 and to celebrate, Carlin shares his bedroom and him in bed with an AI caption calling him ‚Äúmy love‚Äù.¬† Evan and Zade have the same haircut these days, and to celebrate even more, they line him up against the wall and throw questions at him.¬† Carlin uses subtitles to tell us what his answers are, and Layla is getting the subtitle treatment these days too.¬† Zade calls himself ‚Äúday‚Äù, the dog Izzy ‚ÄúI-I‚Äù and labels everything ‚Äúme‚Äù, which Carlin thinks is just the most precious thing ever.¬† The comments are filled with people saying to get his hearing checked and asking about his speech therapy‚Ä¶. But there are also SO many comments from people saying they wish he was theirs, he‚Äôs so cute, adorable, chunky, he has their heart‚Ä¶ all of that and his reel still doesn‚Äôt perform to the level of Layla in a princess costume.¬† Carlin and Evan stay up late decorating for Zade‚Äôs birthday morning, and she links everything while using AI to tell us that the price of helium ‚Äúcan be quite high‚Äù‚Ä¶this hillbilly fundie queen suddenly writes as though she is Kate Middleton.¬† Carlin promotes another local business‚Ä¶ this time an ice cream shop and if you add that to the pool guy, the Christmas lights guy, the pilates place, and the car wrap guy you really have to wonder how the Stewarts are performing nationally.¬† Pretty soon they will be the Grand Marshalls in the Rocky Top July 4th parade. The Stewarts have to drop a second vlog to get back on track and lately they have shifted to Carlin opening them up.¬† It‚Äôs a tad less jarring than Evan the cartoon character screaming at you.¬† It‚Äôs mostly a repeat of all of the content she shared all week, but it‚Äôs sponsored by a company that has given them a ton of new stuff‚Ä¶ a rocker for the new baby, a lift chair for Evan‚Äôs parents whom he calls ‚Äúelderly‚Äù now that they are 70‚Ä¶ and a portable sauna.¬† Warden and Trace come over to put it together bc‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Evan. Trace strips down to his skivvies to show it off and Evan the pud sits next to him fully clothed.¬† Eventually Evan leaves the sauna and Trace puts on an only fans show that features him stretched out, kicking his legs around and posing like the model he thinks he is.¬† NIKE! I can just picture Gil in there, reading Revelations and telling his kids this isn‚Äôt half as hot as hell is going to be. Anyway, Evan takes Zade golfing with Gil, Trace and JebJud and sticks a portable microphone on his hat so they can catch every unintelligible word.¬† This vlog has ten minutes of golf, and another ten minutes of the Stew Crew at Dollywood where they use vouchers to play games and Evan accidentally wins a giant stuffed animal for Zade, the birthday boy.¬† Princess Layla demands her dad win her one equally as large from the seat of her stroller throne.¬† Evan snaps at Carlin when she insists he keep trying to win for Layla, but he pushes onward while Layla is instructed to pray for him to win.¬† He eventually wins or the guy just gives them the toy and the stroller is loaded down with more crap they will never touch again.¬† There‚Äôs a lot to analyze in that little clip of this family interaction.¬† Namely, why would they choose to show us that at all?

¬†
        2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The poor Clark kids have no routine and have learned to fall asleep wherever their parents drag them.¬† This time, Hailey gets to be carried around a store at 7:30 on a Monday nightwhile her parents try to find Katie a cowboy chic outfit to wear to her Talent Manager‚Äôs Nashville event.¬† Katie has a long night ahead bc after shopping, she still has to sell frozen meat.¬† Aunt Michael comes to keep the kids so Katie and Travis can go bowling with the other Christian child exploiters.¬† Most of the couples they have all become fast friends with like Devin Cordle are also at this event.¬† Katie seems shy and unsure of herself.¬† Most of these people have books, TV appearances, podcasts‚Ä¶several streams of income, so we know what to expect from the Clarks moving forward.¬† Back at home, they take Hailey to a park so they can film her blowing dandelions, and Warden comes over to hang lights and mirrors in their bathroom.¬† In the vlog they explain that they missed ILY day bc Katie had food poisoning.¬† Why couldn‚Äôt someone at least come take their kids to the party?¬† I thought these folks were so close, but any sickness or temporary hiccup and they gone like yesterday.¬† They are supposed to be clearing up assumptions.¬† The last time they did this they ended up having to edit the video bc Travis said he had thought of divorcing Katie, so we know this one is sure to be a yawner.¬† Travis tells us he makes no money on his music unless he is out touring and he isn‚Äôt going to do that bc‚Ä¶ Katie won‚Äôt let him.¬† Katie says she may pursue her dream to be a nurse in ten years when her kids are in school and that entire sentence is a lie.¬† They are heading out on a Disney cruise in 2 weeks, but unlike the Stewarts, say they will not film the entire trip bc it‚Äôs a vacation. Does anybody here believe it? (Ben voice w/headphones).¬† Travis wants Katie to have less anxiety over posting to social media.¬† She overanalyzes everything and deletes many things that she posts.¬† Funny enough, she obviously has no issue exploiting her children, but does worry about how she, personally, looks. We also learn that Katie still wears dresses around the Clark family bc that‚Äôs their conviction.¬† They tiptoe around the religion conversation and Travis tells us that they have ONE podcast episode ready to go but have no idea when they plan to release it.¬† Travis says he has had to learn not to be so selfish and immature and directly after that he says that in five years he hopes to be able to focus more on HIS music.¬† The entire time they talk, Hailey crawls all over them, doing splits upside down with a skirt on‚Ä¶they decide to keep it all in.¬† Katie escapes to the hair salon where she dyes her hair a darker blonde and leaves the extensions out.¬† She meet up with Travis at their favorite spot‚Ä¶ the mall where once again, Hailey is asleey while they meander about.¬† Travis says his dad is doing so well that his parents are coming in to town to visit.¬† I wonder if Momma and Daddy Clark will have to sleep in the detached garage?

        3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Josie Balka is all about working smarter, not harder.¬† She reruns an old ad for a grocery delivery service while the hired help clean her house‚Ä¶ and her coffee machine. We see Kelton acting as super dad, cooking supper while holding a baby, and Josie asks for questions from her followers.¬† She uses those questions to drop the same old links for the same old products and then apologizes for not answering more.¬† She films baby Miles playing with cousin Ryker and shows the girls in their bedroom, being tucked in by Kelton.¬† One of the questions she answers is ‚ÄúWhat kind of hair rollers do you use‚Äù‚Ä¶and I mean‚Ä¶ be so for real.¬† She shares her favorite self-tanner so your knuckles can be permanently orange just like hers and explains how she does her Bible study (whenever she can fit it in).¬† Josie is proud to say the house is clean and all of her laundry is done.¬† Her sisters should take note‚Ä¶ this is how wealthy folks spend their money.¬† This gives her loads of time to sell cereal, rush the girls to homeschool co-op, and film a close up of her iced coffee brewing.¬† Josie sounds like a purring cat when she talks these days, and she gravel-whispers that they are heading to Hawaii with the entire Balka clan in May and to celebrate Kelton‚Äôs grandparents are hosting a luau at their home.¬† Josie tells us this while wearing her new crazy 8 Red Baron glasses.¬† About a month ago she went in heavy on the new frames content and then picked the exact opposite of what everyone told her to do and so here she sits, looking like a beetle.¬† We see snaps from the whitest luau ever, and the girls dance around for the camera in fake grass skirts.¬† Josie has a new sneaker endorsement and she sells them by changing in to various short dresses for a trip to the park.¬† Everything she puts on looks less than ideal for the park, and more like Sunday brunchattire, but our fearless heroine presses on and actually does go to the park dressed in a miniskirt.

¬†
        4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The queen of not so passive aggression, Alyssa Webster, this week rocked IG‚Äôs world by sharing the most fire content EVER.¬† That‚Äôs right.¬† While others may be cruising, visiting theme parks and hanging out together‚Ä¶ the OG Bates Influencer was tearing up the world featuring‚Ä¶. Mop content.¬† Mmmhmmm you read that right.¬† Alyssa is excited about a mop that everyone else discovered about 5 years ago and she spends the better portion of a day filming herself using it.¬† She is also excited about her knock off cheap Dyson replacement that husband of the year Lurch got for her, and her Hoover upright vacuum found in Dollar Generals nationwide.¬† Please shop her links for these mid products.¬† She begs you.¬† Alyssa admits that some of the products she is sharing links to she doesn‚Äôt even own‚Ä¶ that hers are ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù.¬† When Thursday rolls around we get the weekly hostage lineup pictures of the kids, complete with crazy filter and the normal picture of her iced coffee.¬† The tee-niny tiny link to Dutch Brothers tells us she is still silently begging this brand to sponsor her. Little Zoey Webster turned 7 this week, and Alyssa was able to beat Kelly Jo out and post about it first this time.¬† They put the scholarship pass to Sea World to good use and head there for the birthday celebration.¬† Alyssa forces the kids to all dress in the same color and plaster on a fake smile so she can take their pictures.¬† Rhett is pitching an absolute kicking fit or unhappy in almost every picture, and Allie is relegated to trying to keep him under control on the kiddie train ride.¬† Later, Alyssa dresses Zoey up like a 46 year old Sunday School teacher for her yearly date with dad. John is in a suit and the whole thing feels so uncomfortable.¬† Why is it such a big deal to get one on one time with your dad? Meanwhile, Kelly Jo calmed her azz down on Zoey‚Äôs birthday post and didn‚Äôt sound so neurotic.¬† She does say she WILL see Zoey in April, so Alyssa better back her ears.¬† Kelly is coming.

¬†

¬†
        5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Whitney Bates must be on sabbatical.¬† She hasn‚Äôt posted about easy plants, whitening strips, grocery delivery, mix tiles, 37 different vitamin supplements OR colostrum in a hot minute.¬† Zach seems to have taken over the job of family influencer.¬† He reposts old reels of steak on toast and shows off a hot sauce promotional box.¬† Meanwhile over at the BSB they are hard at work selling an $80 cotton dress that is $14 from Shein and $26 on Amazon.¬† Whitney does show off the family spending the day at the soccer fields, and Zach films them all in the car heading to take family pictures. ‚ÄúFamily pictures‚Äù from the Bates can mean so many different things.¬† In the Bates Kitchen this week‚Ä¶ Jackson Bates is the guest star.¬† Jackson says he learned to cook when he ran away from home and went to Duggarville at a young age.¬† He‚Äôs preparing rack of lamb that his brother in law Nick taught him how to make.¬† Zach‚Äôs dog is incessantly barking in the background, but they press on.¬† Jackson gives us exactly zero information about his current life and he and Zach chomp into what appears to be nearly raw lamb.¬† I know some people like it this way, but I could still hear the faint baa baa baa‚Äôing coming from this thing.¬† The comments are all from people so happy to see Jackson.¬† They ask lots of questions that Zach does not answer.¬† A ton of comments are begging Zach to cook with Gil so we can look forward to that train wreck coming soon.
¬†
¬†


        6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lydia Bates and the second longest pregnancy on record soldiered on this week and milked every ounce of content possible out of her glucose test.¬† Ryker and Trace go with her and they all chant ‚Äúchug chug chug‚Äù while she sucks down the sugary drink.¬† Trace continues to film her while Lydia tries not to toss her cookies.¬† The rest of the week is just Lydia showing Ryker looking out of the window, playing or filming her white cat laying on her white bed in her white bedroom.¬† They also show us Ryker and Trace twinning in the same outfit‚Ä¶ when did these grown men start wanting to look like preschoolers?¬† Their weekly vlog is all about ILY day.¬† Trace tells us they haven‚Äôt given each other gifts in years now, but this year there is a $100 limit.¬† That‚Äôs richer than the past when Gil handed out $20 bills.¬† Trace drew Judson‚Äôs name and gifts him an RC car and some shoes that do not fit.¬† Trace was told Jud is a size 9.5 and may well be the tallest Bates yet, but he doesn‚Äôt believe it, and so Jud will have to take his Nikes back to the store.¬† Lydia has Kelton‚Äôs name and this has thrown her into a full on panic.¬† She doesn‚Äôt like people watching her open gifts, nor does she want to see the other person open what she has gifted.¬† Trace poo-poos away her feelings and tells her that maybe she will get clothes for the new baby and wouldn‚Äôt that be great.¬† Lydia side eyes the camera and screams internally.¬† Tori had Lydia‚Äôs name and gifts her a pair of $80 Adidas Sambas.¬† Katie had Trace‚Äôs name and he gets a brand new Apple Watch. Evan is in the background the entire time absolutely hoovering an ice cream sundae.¬† They give an extended look at everyone at the party, the games, and the presents.¬† The whole gift giving thing seems to be another way for these people to compete.¬† Could that have been what stopped some siblings from attending this year?
¬†
¬†
        7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After returning to YouTube last week to promote all of her upcoming content, this week, Erin Paine did absolutely nothing.¬† At the time of writing there is no new vlog sharing her amazing, portable homeschool room, or showing off their family pictures.¬† All Erin gave us this week was a link to go purchase her old piano CDs from 2010, and a few shots of her kids playing non-religious games.¬† I‚Äôm sure that was just for the ‚Äògram and they went right back to reciting the beatitudes after. She also made chocolate chip cookies and shared the recipe.¬† They seem to have real sugar and real chocolate in them.¬† No clue if the kids actually got to eat the cookies‚Ä¶ those could have been for their cult lead‚Ä¶ Pastor.
¬†
¬†

¬†
        8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Michael Keilen was a busy bee on both Instagram and YouTube this week.¬† She congratulated Jackson and Erin on their pregnancy and shared a carousel of pictures from I Love You Day, and also thanked Katie for allowing her to babysit Hailey and Harvey.¬† Her party recap on IG shows the Balka girls and the Smith girls in their hand sewn costumes created by Michael, along with the dress she made herself.¬† The Smith boys and Brandon are all in soda jerk aprons.¬† We see Gil dressed like a 50s greaser and Kelly Jo dressed as‚Ä¶ an IBLP cult mom with a 1950s mentality.¬† Maybe Michael should employ a little chatgpt for her captions because she says that March brought lots of activity where they were busy with‚Ä¶ activities.¬† Whew.¬† The Keilens have a new vlog that recaps Jackson‚Äôs baby shower and the ILYD party.¬† We see a time lapse of Michael setting up the baby shower with seating for 80 people.¬† Kelly Joe does not appear in any of the video but Michael praises her endlessly anyway.¬† She says Kelly has such amazing ideas.¬† What she doesn‚Äôt say is that she and Brandon do all of the work.¬† Brandon gives us a clue to where his new job may be when he says he got a huge box from work.¬† The box is marked as ‚Äúglass‚Äù and could have held shower doors.¬† In anycase, he works tirelessly, for days, to turn it into an ice cream shop.¬† They made all of the decorations, did all of the decorating and sewed almost all of the costumes for BOTH events‚Ä¶ but somehow, all praise still goes to Kelly.¬† They get a warm thank you for all of their hard work when Gil smashes in to the side of their car while trying to park.¬† He says he will get it fixed‚Ä¶ but, do we believe him?¬† We see JebJud dressed up as an old man holding a rifle on the couch.¬† So apropos for this crowd.¬† We learn that Callie earned the ‚Äújunior biggest heart award‚Äù.¬† Hope that came with a fat check. 
¬†
¬†

¬†
        9.  Lawson and Tiffany continue to run about 2 months behind time on their YouTube vlog.¬† In the newest vlog, we see Callie and JebJud getting dropped off in Nashville while Kelly, Gil and Warden head to a wedding in Hawaii.¬† Before Warden can go, he has to repair Lawson‚Äôs dishwasher.¬† They take his 2 siblings and the baby and set off on yet another cross country trip.¬† This time, they are headed to Nate‚Äôs in Arkansas.¬† When they arrive at Nathan‚Äôs camper, Tiffy is surprised with a new to her Duggarmobile.¬† Lawson bought her a 4runner and she is less than enthused.¬† In fact, she is so not excited, that she has to apologize for it later in the vlog.¬† We see you Tiffy.¬† We wouldn‚Äôt be hyped for a Duggar dirt lot ride either.¬† Baby Will is in constant motion.¬† Lawson is forever bouncing, swaying, rolling this baby around.¬† He never seems to be put down and is always in a container of some kind.¬† Nathan shows off the 7 acres of land he has purchased in the middle of the Duggar compound.¬† They plan to build a house, but for now, they are still living in the RV.¬† Apparently in exchange for posting and exploiting Esther giving birth, Lawson has to give his brother‚Äôs aviation business a 25 minute live advertisement because this is what the rest of the vlog is.¬† Nathan walks the viewer through helicopters and airplanes and the different arms of his business.¬† Dude is super knowledgeable about aircraft and he takes JebJud up for a ride in a helicopter.¬† Nate has to fly a race car driver client to a race in Tennessee, so Esther and her 2 kids ride home with Lawson and Tiffany so she can go and visit her family..¬† Callie and JebJud must have ridden in the trunk or stayed behind with the Duggars.¬† However they did it, Lawson winds up at the ILY day party and Callie is there along with 3 Duggar daughters.¬† Throughout the vlog Lawson makes comment after comment about Tiffy having another baby.¬† She does a lot of nervous giggling, but is happy to play along with the pregnancy baiting.¬† Baby Will is 8 months old.¬† Tiffy is on Instagram pushing her same old story of how she can‚Äôt believe this is her life and how during Covid she was living alone in San Diego, but just look at her now.¬† Lawson films himself at the grocery store with Will.¬† He lets the baby pick up random snacks and gnaw and drool all over them.¬† Anything for content.¬† The family goes for a walk in the park, and they give Will a new toy that they shake right in his face non stop.¬† The kid never gets a minute‚Äôs peace.¬† Baby Will and Tiffy are not at the big Bates party.¬† Lawson says he is dressed like James Dean, but is really just in a jacket with a popped collar.¬† Later he is watching Tennessee basketball with the baby and has closed captioning on.¬† Maybe he‚Äôs trying to learn.¬† No sighting and no mention of Duke the dog.¬† Hashtag find Duke.¬† Hashtag where is Duke.
¬†


¬†
        10.¬†¬† ¬†Kelly Joe posts for Kolters 5th birthday.¬† She says Kolter is too old to be picked up any longer.¬† You hear that Carlin?¬† Kelly also points out that Kolter is much smarter than all of the other kids based on the way he played a game at the party.¬† We see Tori‚Äôs boys wearing the Tennessee Plumbing hat AND the infamous sad hat‚Ä¶. Kelly Joe thanks the Keilens for helping her make the 2 events a huge success.¬† Again I ask, what would these events have been without Michael and Brandon?¬† Kelly is back at the farm with Momma Jane.¬† She asks for people to pray for Janie as she is undergoing a 6 week round of radiation.¬† Momma Jane says Kelly is taking care of her and Michael is coming to help as well.¬† In the comments, Kelly explains that Jane has beaten cancer before, but has been diagnosed with vaginal cancer.¬† Great reminder to keep having checkups even if you‚Äôve had a hysterectomy.

Please add if I missed any!

Jasmine, the married mother who cheats on her husband with rich old married dudes

Monica, the unmedicated bipolar mother of the Gallaghers who habitually abandoned her family

Karen...just, Karen

Sammi, the estranged eldest Gallagher, who had a few sweet genuine moments in the beginning (like when she made the alibi bar in Sheila's kitchen for a dying Frank) but of course went batshit (shooting Frank in the arm to test if he cares about her, instructing her young child how to blow prison guards for protection, etc)

Queenie, Sammi's hippie dippie mother who made Lip cum his pants by rubbing his foot. ""cum for grandma!"" 

Bonnie , Carl's girlfriend who slips acid in a teachers coffee, robs a liquor store at gunpoint, and crashes a car through a storefront to steal snacks & chocolate milk 

Cassidy, the girl who romanticized the Gallagher's poor lifestyle and had an unhealthy obsession with Carl.  Also the most lazily written off character in Shameless history.

Blake, pedophile woman who moves into the neighborhood & naired off Lip's pubes while she was sucking his dick with peanut butter 

Bianca, the doctor with a terminal cancer diagnosis who wanted to live the last days she had as wild as possible, including fucking Frank on the train tracks while a train was approaching.

Helene, the college professor in an open marriage who fucked Lip within hours of meeting him 

Lori, the manager of the Captain Bob's Shrimp who habitually tries to fuck teenage Carl 

And of course,, there's Tami.  the blonde bombshell from a well-to-do family who makes a lot of assumptions about Lip due to being poor, and resents him for it more and more as time goes on.  the first time I watched shameless, I didn't like her, but this time i saw her more as sheltered and naive than being a jerk.

The Stewarts have to drop a second vlog to get back on track and lately they have shifted to Carlin opening them up.¬† It‚Äôs a tad less jarring than Evan the cartoon character screaming at you.¬† It‚Äôs mostly a repeat of all of the content she shared all week, but it‚Äôs sponsored by a company that has given them a ton of new stuff‚Ä¶ a rocker for the new baby, a lift chair for Evan‚Äôs parents whom he calls ‚Äúelderly‚Äù now that they are 70‚Ä¶ and a portable sauna.¬† Warden and Trace come over to put it together bc‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Evan. Trace strips down to his skivvies to show it off and Evan the pud sits next to him fully clothed.¬† Eventually Evan leaves the sauna and Trace puts on an only fans show that features him stretched out, kicking his legs around and posing like the model he thinks he is.¬† NIKE! I can just picture Gil in there, reading Revelations and telling his kids this isn‚Äôt half as hot as hell is going to be. Anyway, Evan takes Zade golfing with Gil, Trace and JebJud and sticks a portable microphone on his hat so they can catch every unintelligible word.¬† This vlog has ten minutes of golf, and another ten minutes of the Stew Crew at Dollywood where they use vouchers to play games and Evan accidentally wins a giant stuffed animal for Zade, the birthday boy.¬† Princess Layla demands her dad win her one equally as large from the seat of her stroller throne.¬† Evan snaps at Carlin when she insists he keep trying to win for Layla, but he pushes onward while Layla is instructed to pray for him to win.¬† He eventually wins or the guy just gives them the toy and the stroller is loaded down with more crap they will never touch again.¬† There‚Äôs a lot to analyze in that little clip of this family interaction.¬† Namely, why would they choose to show us that at all?

¬†
        2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The poor Clark kids have no routine and have learned to fall asleep wherever their parents drag them.¬† This time, Hailey gets to be carried around a store at 7:30 on a Monday nightwhile her parents try to find Katie a cowboy chic outfit to wear to her Talent Manager‚Äôs Nashville event.¬† Katie has a long night ahead bc after shopping, she still has to sell frozen meat.¬† Aunt Michael comes to keep the kids so Katie and Travis can go bowling with the other Christian child exploiters.¬† Most of the couples they have all become fast friends with like Devin Cordle are also at this event.¬† Katie seems shy and unsure of herself.¬† Most of these people have books, TV appearances, podcasts‚Ä¶several streams of income, so we know what to expect from the Clarks moving forward.¬† Back at home, they take Hailey to a park so they can film her blowing dandelions, and Warden comes over to hang lights and mirrors in their bathroom.¬† In the vlog they explain that they missed ILY day bc Katie had food poisoning.¬† Why couldn‚Äôt someone at least come take their kids to the party?¬† I thought these folks were so close, but any sickness or temporary hiccup and they gone like yesterday.¬† They are supposed to be clearing up assumptions.¬† The last time they did this they ended up having to edit the video bc Travis said he had thought of divorcing Katie, so we know this one is sure to be a yawner.¬† Travis tells us he makes no money on his music unless he is out touring and he isn‚Äôt going to do that bc‚Ä¶ Katie won‚Äôt let him.¬† Katie says she may pursue her dream to be a nurse in ten years when her kids are in school and that entire sentence is a lie.¬† They are heading out on a Disney cruise in 2 weeks, but unlike the Stewarts, say they will not film the entire trip bc it‚Äôs a vacation. Does anybody here believe it? (Ben voice w/headphones).¬† Travis wants Katie to have less anxiety over posting to social media.¬† She overanalyzes everything and deletes many things that she posts.¬† Funny enough, she obviously has no issue exploiting her children, but does worry about how she, personally, looks. We also learn that Katie still wears dresses around the Clark family bc that‚Äôs their conviction.¬† They tiptoe around the religion conversation and Travis tells us that they have ONE podcast episode ready to go but have no idea when they plan to release it.¬† Travis says he has had to learn not to be so selfish and immature and directly after that he says that in five years he hopes to be able to focus more on HIS music.¬† The entire time they talk, Hailey crawls all over them, doing splits upside down with a skirt on‚Ä¶they decide to keep it all in.¬† Katie escapes to the hair salon where she dyes her hair a darker blonde and leaves the extensions out.¬† She meets up with Travis at their favorite spot‚Ä¶ the mall -where once again, Hailey is asleep while they meander about.¬† Travis says his dad is doing so well that his parents are coming in to town to visit.¬† I wonder if Momma and Daddy Clark will have to sleep in the detached garage?
¬†
¬†

¬†
        3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Josie Balka is all about working smarter, not harder.¬† She reruns an old ad for a grocery delivery service while the hired help clean her house‚Ä¶ and her coffee machine. We see Kelton acting as super dad, cooking supper while holding a baby, and Josie asks for questions from her followers.¬† She uses those questions to drop the same old links for the same old products and then apologizes for not answering more.¬† She films baby Miles playing with cousin Ryker and shows the girls in their bedroom, being tucked in by Kelton.¬† One of the questions she answers is ‚ÄúWhat kind of hair rollers do you use‚Äù‚Ä¶and I mean‚Ä¶ be so for real.¬† She shares her favorite self-tanner so your knuckles can be permanently orange just like hers and explains how she does her Bible study (whenever she can fit it in).¬† Josie is proud to say the house is clean and all of her laundry is done.¬† Her sisters should take note‚Ä¶ this is how wealthy folks spend their money.¬† This gives her loads of time to sell cereal, rush the girls to homeschool co-op, and film a close up of her iced coffee brewing.¬† Josie sounds like a purring cat when she talks these days, and she gravel-whispers that they are heading to Hawaii with the entire Balka clan in May and to celebrate Kelton‚Äôs grandparents are hosting a luau at their home.¬† Josie tells us this while wearing her new crazy 8 Red Baron glasses.¬† About a month ago she went in heavy on the new frames content and then picked the exact opposite of what everyone told her to do and so here she sits, looking like a beetle.¬† We see snaps from the whitest luau ever, and the girls dance around for the camera in fake grass skirts.¬† Josie has a new sneaker endorsement and she sells them by changing in to various short dresses for a trip to the park.¬† Everything she puts on looks less than ideal for the park, and more like Sunday brunchattire, but our fearless heroine presses on and actually does go to the park dressed in a miniskirt.
¬†
¬†

¬†
        4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The queen of not so passive aggression, Alyssa Webster, this week rocked IG‚Äôs world by sharing the most fire content EVER.¬† That‚Äôs right.¬† While others may be cruising, visiting theme parks and hanging out together‚Ä¶ the OG Bates Influencer was tearing up the world featuring‚Ä¶. Mop content.¬† Mmmhmmm you read that right.¬† Alyssa is excited about a mop that everyone else discovered about 5 years ago and she spends the better portion of a day filming herself using it.¬† She is also excited about her knock off cheap Dyson replacement that husband of the year Lurch got for her, and her Hoover upright vacuum found in Dollar Generals nationwide.¬† Please shop her links for these mid products.¬† She begs you.¬† Alyssa admits that some of the products she is sharing links to she doesn‚Äôt even own‚Ä¶ that hers are ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù.¬† When Thursday rolls around we get the weekly hostage lineup pictures of the kids, complete with crazy filter and the normal picture of her iced coffee.¬† The tee-niny tiny link to Dutch Brothers tells us she is still silently begging this brand to sponsor her. Little Zoey Webster turned 7 this week, and Alyssa was able to beat Kelly Jo out and post about it first this time.¬† They put the scholarship pass to Sea World to good use and head there for the birthday celebration.¬† Alyssa forces the kids to all dress in the same color and plaster on a fake smile so she can take their pictures.¬† Rhett is pitching an absolute kicking fit or unhappy in almost every picture, and Allie is relegated to trying to keep him under control on the kiddie train ride.¬† Later, Alyssa dresses Zoey up like a 46 year old Sunday School teacher for her yearly date with dad. John is in a suit and the whole thing feels so uncomfortable.¬† Why is it such a big deal to get one on one time with your dad? Meanwhile, Kelly Jo calmed her azz down on Zoey‚Äôs birthday post and didn‚Äôt sound so neurotic.¬† She does say she WILL see Zoey in April, so Alyssa better back her ears.¬† Kelly is coming. 
¬†
¬†

¬†
        5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Whitney Bates must be on sabbatical.¬† She hasn‚Äôt posted about easy plants, whitening strips, grocery delivery, mix tiles, 37 different vitamin supplements OR colostrum in a hot minute.¬† Zach seems to have taken over the job of family influencer.¬† He reposts old reels of steak on toast and shows off a hot sauce promotional box.¬† Meanwhile over at the BSB they are hard at work selling an $80 cotton dress that is $14 from Shein and $26 on Amazon.¬† Whitney does show off the family spending the day at the soccer fields, and Zach films them all in the car heading to take family pictures. ‚ÄúFamily pictures‚Äù from the Bates can mean so many different things.¬† In the Bates Kitchen this week‚Ä¶ Jackson Bates is the guest star.¬† Jackson says he learned to cook when he ran away from home and went to Duggarville at a young age.¬† He‚Äôs preparing rack of lamb that his brother in law Nick taught him how to make.¬† Zach‚Äôs dog is incessantly barking in the background, but they press on.¬† Jackson gives us exactly zero information about his current life and he and Zach chomp into what appears to be nearly raw lamb.¬† I know some people like it this way, but I could still hear the faint baa baa baa‚Äôing coming from this thing.¬† The comments are all from people so happy to see Jackson.¬† They ask lots of questions that Zach does not answer.¬† A ton of comments are begging Zach to cook with Gil so we can look forward to that train wreck coming soon.
¬†
¬†


        6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lydia Bates and the second longest pregnancy on record soldiered on this week and milked every ounce of content possible out of her glucose test.¬† Ryker and Trace go with her and they all chant ‚Äúchug chug chug‚Äù while she sucks down the sugary drink.¬† Trace continues to film her while Lydia tries not to toss her cookies.¬† The rest of the week is just Lydia showing Ryker looking out of the window, playing or filming her white cat laying on her white bed in her white bedroom.¬† They also show us Ryker and Trace twinning in the same outfit‚Ä¶ when did these grown men start wanting to look like preschoolers?¬† Their weekly vlog is all about ILY day.¬† Trace tells us they haven‚Äôt given each other gifts in years now, but this year there is a $100 limit.¬† That‚Äôs richer than the past when Gil handed out $20 bills.¬† Trace drew Judson‚Äôs name and gifts him an RC car and some shoes that do not fit.¬† Trace was told Jud is a size 9.5 and may well be the tallest Bates yet, but he doesn‚Äôt believe it, and so Jud will have to take his Nikes back to the store.¬† Lydia has Kelton‚Äôs name and this has thrown her into a full on panic.¬† She doesn‚Äôt like people watching her open gifts, nor does she want to see the other person open what she has gifted.¬† Trace poo-poos away her feelings and tells her that maybe she will get clothes for the new baby and wouldn‚Äôt that be great.¬† Lydia side eyes the camera and screams internally.¬† Tori had Lydia‚Äôs name and gifts her a pair of $80 Adidas Sambas.¬† Katie had Trace‚Äôs name and he gets a brand new Apple Watch. Evan is in the background the entire time absolutely hoovering an ice cream sundae.¬† They give an extended look at everyone at the party, the games, and the presents.¬† The whole gift giving thing seems to be another way for these people to compete.¬† Could that have been what stopped some siblings from attending this year?
¬†
¬†
        7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After returning to YouTube last week to promote all of her upcoming content, this week, Erin Paine did absolutely nothing.¬† At the time of writing there is no new vlog sharing her amazing, portable homeschool room, or showing off their family pictures.¬† All Erin gave us this week was a link to go purchase her old piano CDs from 2010, and a few shots of her kids playing non-religious games.¬† I‚Äôm sure that was just for the ‚Äògram and they went right back to reciting the beatitudes after. She also made chocolate chip cookies and shared the recipe.¬† They seem to have real sugar and real chocolate in them.¬† No clue if the kids actually got to eat the cookies‚Ä¶ those could have been for their cult lead‚Ä¶ Pastor.
¬†
¬†

¬†
        8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Michael Keilen was a busy bee on both Instagram and YouTube this week.¬† She congratulated Jackson and Emerson on their pregnancy and shared a carousel of pictures from I Love You Day, and also thanked Katie for allowing her to babysit Hailey and Harvey.¬† Her party recap on IG shows the Balka girls and the Smith girls in their hand sewn costumes created by Michael, along with the dress she made herself.¬† The Smith boys and Brandon are all in soda jerk aprons.¬† We see Gil dressed like a 50s greaser and Kelly Jo dressed as‚Ä¶ an IBLP cult mom with a 1950s mentality.¬† Maybe Michael should employ a little chatgpt for her captions because she says that March brought lots of activity where they were busy with‚Ä¶ activities.¬† Whew.¬† The Keilens have a new vlog that recaps Jackson‚Äôs baby shower and the ILYD party.¬† We see a time lapse of Michael setting up the baby shower with seating for 80 people.¬† Kelly Joe does not appear in any of the video but Michael praises her endlessly anyway.¬† She says Kelly has such amazing ideas.¬† What she doesn‚Äôt say is that she and Brandon do all of the work.¬† Brandon gives us a clue to where his new job may be when he says he got a huge box from work.¬† The box is marked as ‚Äúglass‚Äù and could have held shower doors.¬† In anycase, he works tirelessly, for days, to turn it into an ice cream shop.¬† They made all of the decorations, did all of the decorating and sewed almost all of the costumes for BOTH events‚Ä¶ but somehow, all praise still goes to Kelly.¬† They get a warm thank you for all of their hard work when Gil smashes in to the side of their car while trying to park.¬† He says he will get it fixed‚Ä¶ but, do we believe him?¬† We see JebJud dressed up as an old man holding a rifle on the couch.¬† So apropos for this crowd.¬† We learn that Callie earned the ‚Äújunior biggest heart award‚Äù.¬† Hope that came with a fat check. 
¬†
¬†

¬†
        9.  Lawson and Tiffany continue to run about 2 months behind time on their YouTube vlog.¬† In the newest vlog, we see Callie and JebJud getting dropped off in Nashville while Kelly, Gil and Warden head to a wedding in Hawaii.¬† Before Warden can go, he has to repair Lawson‚Äôs dishwasher.¬† They take his 2 siblings and the baby and set off on yet another cross country trip.¬† This time, they are headed to Nate‚Äôs in Arkansas.¬† When they arrive at Nathan‚Äôs camper, Tiffy is surprised with a new to her Duggarmobile.¬† Lawson bought her a 4runner and she is less than enthused.¬† In fact, she is so not excited, that she has to apologize for it later in the vlog.¬† We see you Tiffy.¬† We wouldn‚Äôt be hyped for a Duggar dirt lot ride either.¬† Baby Will is in constant motion.¬† Lawson is forever bouncing, swaying, rolling this baby around.¬† He never seems to be put down and is always in a container of some kind.¬† Nathan shows off the 7 acres of land he has purchased in the middle of the Duggar compound.¬† They plan to build a house, but for now, they are still living in the RV.¬† Apparently in exchange for posting and exploiting Esther giving birth, Lawson has to give his brother‚Äôs aviation business a 25 minute live advertisement because this is what the rest of the vlog is.¬† Nathan walks the viewer through helicopters and airplanes and the different arms of his business.¬† Dude is super knowledgeable about aircraft and he takes JebJud up for a ride in a helicopter.¬† Nate has to fly a race car driver client to a race in Tennessee, so Esther and her 2 kids ride home with Lawson and Tiffany so she can go and visit her family..¬† Callie and JebJud must have ridden in the trunk or stayed behind with the Duggars.¬† However they did it, Lawson winds up at the ILY day party and Callie is there along with 3 Duggar daughters.¬† Throughout the vlog Lawson makes comment after comment about Tiffy having another baby.¬† She does a lot of nervous giggling, but is happy to play along with the pregnancy baiting.¬† Baby Will is 8 months old.¬† Tiffy is on Instagram pushing her same old story of how she can‚Äôt believe this is her life and how during Covid she was living alone in San Diego, but just look at her now.¬† Lawson films himself at the grocery store with Will.¬† He lets the baby pick up random snacks and gnaw and drool all over them.¬† Anything for content.¬† The family goes for a walk in the park, and they give Will a new toy that they shake right in his face non stop.¬† The kid never gets a minute‚Äôs peace.¬† Baby Will and Tiffy are not at the big Bates party.¬† Lawson says he is dressed like James Dean, but is really just in a jacket with a popped collar.¬† Later he is watching Tennessee basketball with the baby and has closed captioning on.¬† Maybe he‚Äôs trying to learn.¬† No sighting and no mention of Duke the dog.¬† Hashtag find Duke.¬† Hashtag where is Duke.
¬†


¬†
        10.¬†¬† ¬†Kelly Joe posts for Kolters 5th birthday.¬† She says Kolter is too old to be picked up any longer.¬† You hear that Carlin?¬† Kelly also points out that Kolter is much smarter than all of the other kids based on the way he played a game at the party.¬† We see Tori‚Äôs boys wearing the Tennessee Plumbing hat AND the infamous sad hat‚Ä¶. Kelly Joe thanks the Keilens for helping her make the 2 events a huge success.¬† Again I ask, what would these events have been without Michael and Brandon?¬† Kelly is back at the farm with Momma Jane.¬† She asks for people to pray for Janie as she is undergoing a 6 week round of radiation.¬† Momma Jane says Kelly is taking care of her and Michael is coming to help as well.¬† In the comments, Kelly explains that Jane has beaten cancer before, but has been diagnosed with vaginal cancer.¬† Great reminder to keep having checkups even if you‚Äôve had a hysterectomy.
