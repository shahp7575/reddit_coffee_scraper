For years, I was always tired. Not sleepy-tired, just mentally foggy and emotionally flat. I could force myself to do the minimum, but I never really wanted to do anything. School? Barely passed. Jobs? Did okay but never cared. I tried all the productivity systems, GTD, Notion, habit trackers, but nothing stuck. It felt like I was fundamentally broken.

The engine behind wanting, motivation, and sustained effort. That hit hard. I realized I wasn‚Äôt lazy. I was running a dopamine system that was completely out of balance, burnt out from overstimulation and always chasing quick hits.
And yeah, like most people, I was addicted to my phone. I used to wake up and scroll Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter before I even got out of bed. That was my first dose of dopamine, and it set the tone for the day: chase stimulation, crash, repeat. No wonder I couldn't follow through on anything hard.
The first thing I changed? I stopped using my phone in the morning. Just one hour. That one change gave me back control. I also moved all social media off my phone and started using it only on desktop. Suddenly, my cravings started to weaken. I was shocked by how much mental clarity I got back, fast.

That explained why everything felt dull unless I was being overstimulated. So I started cutting down the noise. No more stacking phone + coffee + snacks. Just one thing at a time.

According to studies Huberman cited, aerobic exercise literally reshapes dopamine receptor dynamics. That blew my mind. I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhacking‚Äù motivation, I was rebuilding it.
I also started playing around with strategic cold showers. I hated them at first. Still kinda do. But I can't lie, they made me feel super alert and clearheaded, and they totally reset my emotional state after doomscrolling or feeling anxious.

It sounds dumb, but it trains your brain to stop needing so much stimulation just to feel okay. That shift alone helped me feel more content doing ""boring"" things like reading or cleaning.
Now I wake up, get sunlight in my eyes, make coffee, and either read or move before I ever touch my phone. That sequence rewired my mornings. I used to dread the day. Now I actually look forward to getting into deep work. Like, real focus. That felt impossible just a year ago.

It's hands-down the best book I‚Äôve read on modern addiction, overstimulation, and the recovery of meaning through effort. It helped me realize just how flooded my dopamine system had become, and how to reset. Also a friend put me onto BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team.

Another underrated gem is The Molecule of More by Daniel Lieberman and Michael Long. This book explains why dopamine makes us chase novelty and big ideas but also why it sabotages our ability to enjoy what we already have. It‚Äôs an insanely good read if you‚Äôve ever wondered why you burn out on hobbies, relationships, or goals fast. This book felt like it read me.
If you want to track and reduce screen time, I liked the Opal app. It‚Äôs not just a blocker, it gamifies focus with streaks and progress bars. I synced it with a few friends and it turned self-discipline into something social, not just self-imposed punishment.
And for quiet moments, I got into Yoga Nidra guided meditations on YouTube. I found one through a neuroscience podcast that mentioned how Yoga Nidra boosts dopamine without stimulation. I now use it like a reset button when my brain feels fried.
Reading saved my brain. No exaggeration. Before all this, I didn‚Äôt even finish one book a year. Now I read 2‚Äì3 per month, and it‚Äôs not just for knowledge. It‚Äôs to remember who I am when I‚Äôm not being pulled in a hundred directions.",2,1759046627.0,GetMotivated,0,1.0,False

In everyday retail, it's gaining ground through processors like¬†**BitPay**¬†and¬†**CoinGate**, enabling payments at merchants like¬†**Chipotle, Baskin-Robbins, Microsoft, and Overstock**. While it may lag behind BTC and ETH in direct small-shop adoption, its presence is undeniable. More significantly, XRP's native strengths are shining in high-value and cross-border contexts. Travel platforms like¬†[**Travala.com**](http://Travala.com)¬†and¬†**Alternative Airlines**¬†(supporting over 600 carriers) accept it, and its use in¬†**remittances by companies like Mercury FX and Cuallix**¬†underscores its core value proposition.

* The key to broader adoption lies with¬†**payment processors**¬†like¬†**BitPay, NOWPayments, and PayPal**, which handle the crypto-to-fiat conversion, eliminating volatility risk for merchants and making XRP acceptance seamless.
* For¬†**luxury and high-value transactions**‚Äîfrom supercars on BitCars to first-class flights‚ÄîXRP's fast settlement and lower fees present a compelling case over traditional payment rails.
* **XRP's primary strength remains in back-end or cross-border payments**, suggesting that its everyday retail growth, while real, is a secondary benefit to its core institutional utility.

This gradual creep into the spending economy feels organic, not forced. It‚Äôs a utility-driven expansion that builds a more resilient case for XRP‚Äôs long-term value beyond pure speculation.

This book explains why dopamine makes us chase novelty and big ideas but also why it sabotages our ability to enjoy what we already have. It‚Äôs an insanely good read if you‚Äôve ever wondered why you burn out on hobbies, relationships, or goals fast. This book felt like it read me.

If you want to track and reduce screen time, I liked the Opal app. It‚Äôs not just a blocker, it gamifies focus with streaks and progress bars. I synced it with a few friends and it turned self-discipline into something social, not just self-imposed punishment.

And for quiet moments, I got into Yoga Nidra guided meditations on YouTube. I found one through a neuroscience podcast that mentioned how Yoga Nidra boosts dopamine without stimulation. I now use it like a reset button when my brain feels fried.

Reading saved my brain. No exaggeration. Before all this, I didn‚Äôt even finish one book a year. Now I read 2‚Äì3 per month, and it‚Äôs not just for knowledge. It‚Äôs to remember who I am when I‚Äôm not being pulled in a hundred directions.

1nsibig,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nsibig/which_coffee_grinder_brand_offers_the_best_value/,Which coffee grinder brand offers the best value?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been brewing coffee at home for over 8 years now, and I've gone through my fair share of coffee grinders. After countless hours of research and hands-on experience, I want to share what I've learned about finding the best value coffee grinder.

First things first - a good coffee grinder is absolutely crucial for a great cup of coffee. You can have the fanciest coffee maker, but if your grinder isn't up to par, you're not going to get the best results.

Recently, I discovered an amazing coffee grinder that really stands out in terms of value for money. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

What makes a coffee grinder worth the investment? Here's what I look for:

1. Consistent Grind Size
The most important feature is how evenly it grinds your beans. Uniform particle size means better extraction and tastier coffee.

2. Durability
The motor and burrs need to handle daily grinding without wearing down quickly. Cheap grinders often burn out within months.

3. Noise Level
Nobody wants to wake up the whole house while grinding beans at 6 AM!

4. Versatility
A good grinder should handle everything from fine espresso to coarse French press grinds.

After testing dozens of models, I found that ceramic burr grinders tend to offer the best balance of performance and value. They're more durable than steel burrs and don't heat up as much during grinding, which helps preserve the coffee's flavor.

For those interested in seeing the specific model I recommend, here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

Some pro tips for maintaining your grinder:
- Clean it regularly (at least monthly)
- Only grind what you need for each brew
- Keep your beans in an airtight container
- Run some cheap rice through it occasionally to remove oils

Remember, investing in a quality grinder now will save you money in the long run. You won't have to replace it as often, and you'll get better-tasting coffee every single day.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments! I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers find their perfect brew setup.",1,1759045075.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nsib8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1nsib8z/best_cloudbet_vpns_for_safe_crypto_betting/,Best Cloudbet VPNs for Safe Crypto Betting,"The cryptocurrency betting market has exploded in 2025, with analysts estimating the sector now surpasses **$5 billion annually**. However, this rapid growth has attracted sophisticated cybercriminals who specifically target crypto bettors. Recent research reveals that users of unregulated gambling platforms face a **65x higher risk of malware infection** compared to traditional websites.

Cloudbet, operating since 2013 as a licensed cryptocurrency betting platform, has built a strong reputation with multi-signature cold storage and industry-standard security measures. However, even when using legitimate platforms like Cloudbet, crypto bettors face unique security challenges that require additional protection layers.

**This guide examines why crypto bettors need enhanced privacy protection and identifies the most secure VPN solutions for safe Cloudbet access.**

# The Growing Security Threat Landscape in Crypto Betting

Cryptocurrency betting presents a perfect storm for cybercriminals: irreversible transactions, high-value targets, and users who often prioritize anonymity. Understanding these threats is crucial for protecting your digital assets.

# DDoS Attacks During Major Events

Cybercriminals increasingly launch **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks** against individual bettors during major sporting events. These attacks overwhelm your internet connection, preventing you from placing bets or withdrawing winnings at crucial moments. Professional attackers can acquire your IP address through various means and target you specifically when high-stakes betting opportunities arise.

# Phishing Campaigns Targeting Crypto Gamblers

Security researchers have identified sophisticated phishing operations specifically designed for crypto betting users. These campaigns often involve:

* **Fake Cloudbet login pages** that steal credentials and wallet information
* **Malicious browser extensions** that modify betting slips and wallet addresses
* **Social engineering attacks** through Discord, Telegram, and Reddit gambling communities

# Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Public Networks

When accessing Cloudbet from hotels, airports, or coffee shops, your connection becomes vulnerable to interception. Attackers on the same network can potentially:

* **Capture login credentials** and two-factor authentication codes
* **Redirect crypto transactions** to attacker-controlled wallets
* **Inject malicious JavaScript** that modifies betting interfaces

# Crypto Wallet-Targeting Malware

Specialized malware variants now target crypto bettors by:

* **Monitoring clipboard activity** to replace wallet addresses during transactions
* **Keylogging crypto wallet passwords** and seed phrases
* **Screenshots of wallet interfaces** to steal private keys
* **Browser session hijacking** to maintain persistent access to betting accounts

# Why Cloudbet Users Need Enhanced Privacy Protection

While Cloudbet implements robust security measures including multi-signature cold storage and SSL encryption, several factors make additional privacy protection essential for users.

# ISP Monitoring and Data Collection

Internet Service Providers can monitor and log your Cloudbet activity, creating detailed profiles of your betting patterns. This data may be:

* **Sold to third parties** for marketing purposes
* **Provided to government agencies** under various legal frameworks
* **Used for bandwidth throttling** during high-traffic betting periods
* **Targeted by hackers** who breach ISP databases

# Geographic Access Restrictions

Cloudbet blocks access from certain jurisdictions due to licensing requirements. Using public proxies or unsecured methods to access the platform can expose you to additional security risks.

# Transaction Privacy Concerns

Blockchain transactions are inherently public, but your IP address can be correlated with your crypto wallet addresses, potentially compromising your financial privacy. Advanced blockchain analysis techniques can trace transaction patterns back to individual users.

# Essential VPN Security Features for Crypto Betting

Not all VPNs provide adequate protection for crypto betting activities. The following features are non-negotiable for maintaining security while using platforms like Cloudbet.

# Military-Grade AES-256 Encryption

Your VPN must use **AES-256 encryption** to protect data transmission. This encryption standard, used by government agencies and financial institutions, ensures that even if your traffic is intercepted, it remains unreadable to attackers.

# Verified No-Logs Policy

Choose VPNs with **independently audited no-logs policies**. This ensures that even if authorities request your data or the VPN company is breached, no records of your Cloudbet activity exist. Look for providers that have undergone third-party audits by firms like PwC or Deloitte.

# Automatic Kill Switch Protection

A **kill switch** immediately cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops unexpectedly. This prevents your real IP address from being exposed during connection interruptions, which commonly occur during live betting sessions.

# DNS Leak Protection

Even with VPN encryption, **DNS leaks** can reveal your browsing activity to your ISP. Advanced DNS leak protection ensures all DNS queries are routed through the VPN's secure servers.

# Obfuscation Technology

Some networks employ **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** to detect and block VPN traffic. Obfuscation technology disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, ensuring reliable access to Cloudbet from restrictive networks.

# Advanced Threat Protection

Modern VPNs should include **built-in malware and phishing protection** to block malicious websites and downloads that specifically target crypto users.

I first met LO when I moved to a new country to do my grad studies on my move-in day. I was staying at a complex where the majority of the grad/post-grad students were staying at and LO offered to help me with my stuff. We hit it off right away, he has this intense but equally reserved and detach vibe to him which I find very intriguing. I, by nature, am very extroverted and chatty so I wanted to break his walls and get to know him. Our friendship was very organic, and we grew this bond right away. The issue is, I identified as ace and due to that I am careful when I navigate new relationships. And during that time he was also talking to this one person, and they slowly started getting serious. So by the time, I figured out that the pull towards him might also be romantic and sexual (so in a way he was the person that made me realize I may not be ace), he was serious with the girl. And that's when things start getting more intense, and that was when I started to realize that this may not just be some crush or even attraction but limerence, because for the first time in my life, I find myself spiraling over someone. What's worse is, romantically speaking he is not even my usual type so that attraction and the pull was not making any sense. 

Realizing that this was not going to be healthy, I decided to slowly create distance. I managed to find a new place and moved out but we still see each other since we work on research projects together and also share the same friend‚Äôs group, have dinners at our advisor‚Äôs place....But even without that it was so hard to do LC because I felt miserable when I was keeping my distance from him and I ruminate more so I just decided to let it be. However, after a few more months he started acting weird with me. From the get-go our connection was full of banter and teasing but he also used to be vulnerable with me and share with me stuff that he doesn‚Äôt discuss with anyone in our friend group. But then suddenly he started being aloof and reserved the way he is with most, he started being distant and pulling away, he started snapping at me when I tease him too much, he stopped sharing much or asking much about me and I find myself oversharing to keep him in my orbit, asking him questions only for him to hum or give noncommittal response or deflect, he started canceling on our plans constantly with last minute excuses‚Ä¶. but when we are in a group he reverts to his old self, he still teases me, we talk like normal, and I also start catching him looking at me intensely, in a very unreadable way, which was new. My limerent addled brain also reads this as him figuring out how I feel about him and trying to set boundaries by making sure our 1:1 time is limited, and our relationship is cordial at most. 

So, I decided to use his ""rejection"" as a fuel to move on. There were days when we were in the lab together, alone, for a full day, but apart from the initial hi and how are you‚Äô s, we won't speak to each other at all because I stopped initiating conversations. And whenever we don‚Äôt have anything together, I stop reaching out or seeking him out to see what he is up to or invite him for a coffee break or late-night snacks when he is so busy to take a break. And when I stopped initiating, I realized that most of our moments in the recent few months happen solely because of me and it actually feels devastating but it also made me feel more secure about my decision. And because I decided to stop chasing, we started having long stretches of days where we won‚Äôt see each other at all or if we do, we will only have generic and soulless small talks. 

This continued for about two month but then about 3 weeks ago, he slowly started initiating things. If he sees me in one of the campus coffee shop he will walk in to have conversation for few minutes, he started teasing me again in our group chats and trying to rile me up but when he realized I am not taking the bait he started texting me directly again (I stopped texting him after he started ignoring my texts and then responding and then ignoring them). The first few texts I ignore or just reacted to but he was persistent, he will send me things that he knows I find funny, he will send me the music that he is listening to (which weirdly were mostly songs about adoration and pining), he started texting me profound lines from the book he just read or screen recording of a show that he was just watching, so I started slowly responding too. Not as enthusiastically as I used to and I don‚Äôt initiate anything, even in my replies I try to give closed answers so I wont feel tethered, waiting for his response, but even then he will still respond with added details. And then he started popping up where I will be in the morning to say good morning and chat a bit. He started seeking me out during day times for a short chat. And then our advisor asked him if he can help me with this one program and he was very enthusiastic about it. Afterwards, he asked me if I want to grab something to eat, I say sure and we chatted, it felt slightly awkward and I was still very guarded. So this guy who normally doesn‚Äôt say much was chatty because he was seeing I wasn't saying much. And since then, he started coming by my lab to go get some food. He also makes it a point to text me daily and we will end up chatting about everything. What also stands out to me is he has been busy with multiple projects so he has been keeping distance from everyone to focus and yet he will still manage to find time to spend a couple of hours with me. I brought that up after I saw him stay longer at night to finish a paper and he told me that when he needs a break he wants to either be by himself or with someone who revitalizes him and left it at that. He also is back to being so sweet with me, like continuously encourages me to take on more projects, helps me when I need contacts to interview, take over menial work when he sees me overwhelmed with stuff, insist on giving me rides on the nights I stay late in campus even though there are shuttle buses that goes by my place.

And now I find myself slipping back and after almost a month of him constantly initiating stuff I am feeling like my walls are crumbling down and I am letting him in again and my limerence that was fading is coming back in full force, I have been thinking about him non-stop over the weekend. But at the same time, I know this shouldn‚Äôt change anything because he still has a partner and I also still fear that he will decide randomly tomorrow that he will go back to that hot and cold behavior that he was dishing out for 5 months.

TL:DR; My LO decided to continuously be around me, treat me very sweetly, be attentive and is generally making it hard for me to not get attached after weeks of cold behavior and after I decided to go LC and now I am slowly finding myself going back to square one.",1,1759044854.0,limerence,1,1.0,False
1nsi9e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1nsi9e0/atomoxetine/,Atomoxetine!!!,"Hi everyone, hope you‚Äôre all doing well! üíõ

Just wanted to drop in and share a recent win: I started atomoxetine (Strattera) not long ago, and honestly - I love it. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs played out so far: 

* Gives me a real *perk me up* in the mornings, almost like my brain‚Äôs had coffee before I even touch a mug
* Hasn‚Äôt affected my sleep at all (a miracle, considering how meds and sleep usually don‚Äôt get along)
* It‚Äôs often (but not always) prescribed as an AM and PM dose, but because it feels pretty energising for me, I just stick with one in the morning. Works like a charm üëåüèª
* So much less hassle than trying to remember Ritalin or dex every 4‚Äì6 hours. Now it‚Äôs just: wake up, breakfast, atomoxetine, and *boom*‚Ä¶ brain online ‚úÖ 
* Supposedly, you can pair it with a stimulant, but that‚Äôs obviously something for your doctor
* Fun fact: research says it‚Äôs about as effective as Ritalin/methylphenidate
* The best bit for me: a lot less anxiety. I have GAD and experience panic attacks on occasion, but this actually seems to dial things down instead of cranking them up
* Side effects? Not much to speak of so far, and compared to the classic stimulants, it feels much gentler
* Not super pricey - about $20‚Äì30 per month depending on dose (maybe a little more or less, but, hey, investing in mental health is always solid value)
* Almost zero risk of abuse (so it‚Äôs not about to turn up at your house in the middle of the night asking you to ‚Äúgo out for one more adventure‚Äù)

If anyone else has had a similar (or totally different) experience, I‚Äôd love to hear it! Honestly, after years of playing medicines Tetris, it‚Äôs nice to actually feel like something fits ‚ò∫Ô∏è

when we get into a fight she says ‚Äúyes you have to do all that because you love me the person that loves should do that ‚Äú she says things like ‚Äú I never asked u to do anything I don‚Äôt want anything from u ‚Äú  she always says that when we fight 

She has high standards I respect that and I was able to meet them but she never appreciated it she js thought it was the bare minimum 

I have never felt appreciation I always felt like I‚Äôm not enough I never told her anything about the way she dresses she a guy bestfriend here and another one in another country which she visits often coz she‚Äôs got family here and even tho it pissed me off I tried to control myself for her , I used to go crazy but I never even raised my voice on her because the thought of her being sad or mad at me was not worth anything I always tried to be calm. I even got a job js so I can spoil her and be able to take her on more dates i used to wake up 7 in the morning js to drive her to her exams wait for her I used to handle all her uni applications I helped her in everything I sacrificed sleep during exam days to stay up when she was mad at me because I loved her so much the thought of her being mad at me wouldn‚Äôt let me sleep 

I did everything because I loved her , there are so many things she will never know that I did for her but at the end ‚Ä¶ I get treated like I was nothing , at the end she chose the easy way out after everything she said that we‚Äôll never leave each other , she herself chose the convenient easy way 
Maybe she found someone else or maybe she doesn‚Äôt need me anymore I wish the best for her 
But I know I did my part I loved with good intentions I gave her my all genuine love . At the end she said maybe we should js be friends because I don‚Äôt have energy to be in a relationship 

If you truly love someone you‚Äôll do anything to stay with them even when it‚Äôs inconvenient.
She didn‚Äôt love me she said she did but she does not.",1,1759044599.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1nsi619,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nsi619/life_is_not_worth_it_anymore/,Life is not worth it anymore,"28f here. My life has been hell since the day I entered the world. 

My father was an abusive alcoholic who attempted to murder my mom. My mom lived a hard life so for god knows what reason she stayed in the marriage and had me in hopes he would get his act together. He did for a bit then started cheating. 

My mom would hit her stomach with me in it among other stuff. Apparently that didn't do the job. My family was convinced I was meant to be here bc I survived all she did in pregnancy. 

She left my dad as soon as I was born and he went off and had a second family and disappeared so at least I didn't know his abusiveness. 

My mom was obviously poor as my family were migrants from a 3rd world country. I was smart but had a learning disability so naturally I was bullied. 

We moved around a lot as a kid so I never had the chance the build solid friendships or groups or have that all American childhood. I would watch movies and draw as an escape. 

I am conventionally attractive but I wasn't a looker when I was a kid. So I went from being bullied and made fun of to being sexualized at the age of 14 by classmates. 

Then I got more attractive in high school when I took up track, but my life in high school turned upside down when my mom had her psychotic break and I had to move to another state with my uncle who is my only father figure until my unstable mom that I've always had to parent got her shit together. 

She ended marrying a very wealthy guy and forced us to have a father daughter relationship. Everyone praised him for taking on another man's child and financing my life from ages 16-24. But he also suffered from alcoholism and he didn't like being a parent so we budded heads a lot. Mom took his side bc if it weren't for him we'd be on the street. Our lives went from renting apartments to living in a multi million dollar coastal home. Drastic jump.

Senior year of high school I was r*ped. I was a virgin. I always held onto fairytale romance as something to believe in, and thought my first time would be given to not a knight in shining armor but at least someone special. After that instance I felt like a used tainted napkin, only good for one thing. 

Got into an emotionally abusive relationship after that bc I needed someone after my rape. Destroyed my confidence entirely. Dropped out of college bc of my mental state. 

Worked at a bookstore, then got offered to model in Europe by an agency. Took the offer because I wanted out of my parents house. 

Ended up with good memories and anorexia. 

Decided to head back home afterwards. Ended up liking a guy and having hope in love again; only to find out I was a backup choice and he was seeing someone else he wanted to get serious with. They are now married.

Devastated; but moved on and put myself out there to find someone new. 

Same thing. Also married the girl right after me. 

Then I got assaulted again; but idk if I could call it r*pe bc I didn't shout or say no, but I didn't say yes the whole time either. I remember silently crying on his chest while he slept bc I couldn't make out what just happened. All I know is I didn't like it. 

Then Covid happened and I decided to get serious about my life and cut off men for a bit. I found my talent in art, I decided I want to go to law and even picked out a university I saw myself thriving in. 

But with Covid things were limited in progress. I met someone who wanted something serious, had his own house, and seemed to have a stable career. 

He treated me like a princess only to find out he was more like Bluebeard. I moved into his home after three months because my stepdad thought it would be a good idea to move out at 25 and get my life going (tail end of Covid.) so my stepdad convinced my mom to let me go move in with new boyfriend and he gave me the van to move my stuff in. 

My life was miserable. He did not have his life together at all. It was all a facade, he wasn't actually enrolled in school, or a career, it was just a goal he never took a step towards but spoke about it like he was already in it. That's how he got me to move in. He needed a cleaner and chef while He played games all day, smoked weed, but because he owned a house he thought he was ready to have a family. He pressured me into giving up my university choice so we can move far away together in a small town. Which I would do if I knew it was worth it, but it wasn't. He didn't have his shit together, he was emotionally immature and was ultimately a boy trying to be a man. The house was always a mess, he would always door dash instead of keep the kitchen clean to help me make food, he didn't exercise or do any physically active stuff which is dangerous and he was extremely controlling. If we couldn't go out together which was often bc he wanted to stay inside; I couldn't go out alone. If I did he would say I'm the worst girl he's ever had. It got to the point where my friends told me I was irrecognizble and i look like the light has been drained from me. That was when I saw death as a sweet alternative. 

I finally up and left him tho. 

After I left him, I had a new found love for life again. I was grateful to be able to move back into my parents house, get coffee in the morning and watch the sunrise. Drive though a scenic route to a small job, I was excited to be exhausted by school again because at least I was working towards something. My entire outlook on life changed. I also became more confident and had a unique insight on love and marriage and was ready to bring in all the fun without the emotional anchor. 

Then boom. I met someone who didn't demand anything, didn't love bomb, didn't do anything crazy. Just a cute, funny happy go lucky goofball and the first date was magical. He was handsome, sweet, didn't come from a crazy wealthy family but my god did he grow up with so much love and had a rich heart, which is what I wanted. He made me want to simpler things in life like a nice morning or football Sunday with him. He went above and beyond to show effort into impressing me and gave me memories I hold onto to this day for comfort. Then, because I am fucking cursed, he had to move away for work. We were only 3 months in, so he didn't think long distance was worth it, and I accepted that. 

Naturally, the girl that he met right after me, he ended up marrying last month. This was 3 years ago. I try to keep the memories I had with him because he was genuinely a good guy, but now it's all tainted and I have nothing to believe in. 

I then move on with grace, wish him the best and love him in silence. I held onto the memories for comfort as I pursued my goals and get back out there because that's what everyone always fucking says right? ""There's a chance; you just gotta put yourself out there."" 

So I do, and I met some great men but no real spark like the last guy. But they all love bomb or adore me for fun so i play the game and treat it the way men treat dating. 

Then I meet another guy who loves bombs the shit out of me. Comes from a wealthy family, went to my dream school, and has zero personality outside of being a jockey business school major. I felt like I shouldn't give him the benefit of the doubt bc all he has are superficial qualities but why not just go for it. He messages me about visiting him back and forth, bringing me to his family, and asks me to meet him on his family vacation and was okay with me meeting his parents. I didn't buy it, so I told him he can fly out to where I'm vacationing if he wants and we will go from there. I was a 14 hour flight away. 

2 months of talking about a future with me, (our vacation was an entire summer) The dude shows up. I shit you not. Took a 14 hour flight to prove his point. 

Then after two days he says he decided he wants to focus on himself but still keep me around while he starts business school (I.e back up girl) I say yeah uh huh sure and just block his number immediately. Probably my fault. 

At this point I'm done with men and am about half way through undergrad getting into law. Then news breaks out about my ancestral country. Like devastating news. I take on some asylum cases and start seeing and hearing things that make me realize how cruel and awful the world truly is. I was scared and heart broken. It made my cyclical about our legal system as well. I realized law may not be what I want and I am back to square one. 

Then, my university choice decided to change their transfer standards and I realized I had to restart my entire semester all over again with other courses if I want to get in. Which made me want to give up on that goal. 

I decided to stick through it and tell myself if this is what I want I am being called to action to chase my dream. It's all about ""how bad you want it"" as everyone fucking says. 

Then in the midst of all this I meet someone in my cynical era. Did not take it seriously, did not let it distract me. But he played the long game. He got me flowers on the first date. He introduced me to his friends, we shared a connection. He told me that he knows I'm guarded and he will wait until I let down my walls. 

Then he disappears because military work. Of course. At this point I'm dead inside so I don't care. 

A year later he shows up in my life again and tells me what happened. And boy is it my fault for being understanding. We talk again, and this time I'm his lifeline during a shitty deployment. He is away from his loved ones, and I should've realized it was his mental state of mind talking. We share intimate stories, memories, and our favorite prices of literature. He tells me that he does have feelings for me, but he is unsure because of my legal career and his constant moving around. 

I tell him I'll give him time to think. He thinks for about a week. Decided I'm what he wants. And like a fucking moron I feel safe and hopeful again. After 4 months of talking. 

Then, he gets news he will not be back in my city for much longer after he arrives from deployment. We would only get two weeks before he's off somewhere else for a year. In my head I knew i would make it work...but if he was already thinking about calling it off...then I guess I have my answer. We see each other briefly when he gets back and then he leaves and I let go again. I say to myself at least I have that memory and I can now move forward with school and focus on my goal. 

Then as I'm about to graduate and transfer, my parents pull a rug from under me. They say they don't want me in their house anymore and I will have to find a full time job instead of going to school because they don't see me doing well in school nor do they think I can become a lawyer. I show them my acceptance letter and their minds did not change. 

So I had to give up my university choice and move to another state with my uncle to find a high paying job and figure out what to do bc rent in my home state is crazy expensive. 

I get a great job, but I hate the god damn state I lived in. I loved my home state, I could be grateful for the small things. I tried to give the new state a chance and even made friends, but I felt empty inside like no goal or dream will make it better. 

Then I start seeing another guy, who spoiled me to death with thousand dollar wine, elaborate dates, and constant texting and trip planning. I try to slow it down bc I've been down this road before, but nope. He tried to break down my walls. Hope restored, then disappointed again as he decides he needs to focus on him. 

Then I hear back from military guy after a while. He found out he will be staying out for a while in a city 3 hours by car away from me. I feel hopeful and we start talking as friends again. He was the only one outside of the goofball I saw myself really loving. I would make the 3 hours work, I would even trade careers for it because he was someone I saw as worth it. 

Then we start talking as more then friends. Then, he drops a bomb on me. He met someone in that city 3 hours away, and he realizes 3 hours is too much with our schedules. Keep in mind, he has not been in a relationship in years, so I knew this girl must be serious. And probably will end up marrying her bc my luck works like that. He still says he wants me in his life as a friend and that in another life if he was in my city he would. I get heartbroken and stop buying the bullshit bc if he cared I wouldn't have been treated like a side chick. But instead of saying that to him, I end up telling him I loved him and I understand. I was suppose to make some posters for his house and he still wants them. Currently he's with this new girl that magically decided he wants to do better by while I'm working on this poster contemplating suicide because I have nothing or no one to believe in. 
All my friends are married with their own lives, and my family isn't close. Death looks so sweet and honestly I don't fucking know why I was put on to the earth. I want out. I need out. I am going to stop dating but I think I am so fucked in my head that even being grateful for a life alone is not worth it to me anymore. 

I used to find comfort in the fact that even if I end up alone I will have some memories to hold onto. But after the hurt the two men I cared about caused me, I can't look back on them the same even if I wanted to. 

I did everything right. I did the putting myself out there, I did the letting go, i did the being a good friend, I did the therapy, I did the persistence. Life just doesn't seem worth it. I am no one's first choice as a best friend, as a daughter, as woman. All I'm good for is chasing and misery in law career because I don't know what to do with my life outside of law nor am I in a financial position to leave, I am not even in my home state anymore. 

Life is just not worth the pain it causes. I am one of those cases. ",2,1759044470.0,depression,0,1.0,False

1nshtfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1nshtfy/dopamine_attention_deficit_disorder_is_real_and/,Dopamine attention deficit disorder is real and most people don‚Äôt know they have it,"I used to wake up, grab my phone, and scroll until my brain felt fried before I even touched work. My motivation tanked, my attention span shrank, and I thought maybe I had ‚Äúdopamine 
deficiency.‚Äù But after digging into the science, books, podcasts, and papers for over 100 hours while also juggling my own job and grad studies, I realized it‚Äôs not that simple. It‚Äôs closer to what 
I‚Äôd call dopamine attention deficit, our generation‚Äôs quiet crisis. 

Dopamine isn‚Äôt about pleasure, it‚Äôs about motivation and learning. Schultz‚Äôs research showed dopamine spikes when life gives us a surprise win and dips when things disappoint. In simple 
words, it teaches the brain what to chase. The problem is the way apps are built: likes, notifications, auto-scroll, they‚Äôre basically mini-slot machines. JAMA followed thousands of teens 
and found constant media use predicted later ADHD-type symptoms. That hit me hard because it explained why my own attention span was tanking even though I never had ADHD. 

Anna Lembke‚Äôs Dopamine Nation gave me the ‚Äúpleasure-pain seesaw‚Äù metaphor. Every scroll spike tips you toward restlessness afterward, so you crave the next scroll faster. That explained why I‚Äôd feel flat right after bingeing content. Huberman‚Äôs podcast taught me that every dopamine 
peak has a cost on your baseline. Stack caffeine, sugar, social, and gaming and suddenly life feels boring in comparison. What worked for me was pulling back peaks in the morning: no 
feeds for the first 90 minutes, just water, sunlight, and one focus sprint. That tiny shift reset my motivation. 

I also found that effortful rewards last longer. Exercise is the most underrated dopamine regulator. Even a 20-minute brisk walk lifts my focus better than coffee. I tried cold showers after 
hearing Huberman talk about the dopamine surge from cold exposure, and surprisingly it gave me steady energy without the crash. Pairing habits with immediate rewards like James Clear suggests, checking off a box or sharing a draft, made the hard stuff feel more rewarding than distractions. 

What really changed me though was building a daily reading habit. Reading rewired how I think. One book that shook me was Stolen Focus by Johann Hari. It‚Äôs a New York Times bestseller 
that digs into how our environment steals concentration. Hari combines deep research with real stories and it made me question every assumption I had about why I couldn‚Äôt focus. Honestly 
the best book I‚Äôve read on attention in the modern world. Another must-read is Dopamine Nation by Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist whose work hit bestseller lists worldwide. This book made me emotional because it didn‚Äôt just explain addiction cycles, it gave me hope that simple resets like exercise and abstinence can restore balance. Insanely good read if you want to 
reclaim your brain. 

On the podcast side, Andrew Huberman‚Äôs Huberman Lab has become my weekly lecture. His dopamine series breaks down complex neuroscience into actionable tools like light exposure, 
effort pairing, and recovery. It feels like a crash course in brain science every time I listen. 

YouTube also surprised me. Ali Abdaal‚Äôs videos on productivity and dopamine regulation were my entry point. He mixes medical training with relatable personal hacks, and his dopamine 
fasting video literally got me to delete Instagram for a month. That one month taught me more about my brain than years of random hacks. Also a friend then put me onto BeFreed, an 
personalized learning app made by a team from Columbia University. It felt like the product I had always wanted but never existed. It builds a personal AI learning model of you and turns books, 
research, and expert talks into custom podcasts that evolve with your struggles. You can pick 
podcast length, from 10 to 40 minutes, and even the host‚Äôs voice. I picked a smoky voice that felt like Samantha. It learns from what I listen to and creates a hyper-personalized roadmap with 
an adaptive study plan that adjusts over time. One episode blended Dopamine Nation, Huberman‚Äôs lessons, and a TED talk on digital addiction to help me rebuild my morning routine. 
I‚Äôm grateful because it brought back my daily reading habit and honestly changed my life.

Lastly, I need to shout out Atomic Habits by James Clear. It‚Äôs the bestselling self-improvement book of the decade for a reason. Clear explains how to make tiny cues and rewards drive huge 
change. Reading it felt like unlocking a cheat code for behavior design. It‚Äôs the best habit book I‚Äôve ever read. 

I‚Äôve seen too many people beat themselves up for being lazy when the real problem is the way our dopamine systems are hijacked. Knowledge and daily reading literally gave me my brain back. If you feel stuck in endless scrolling, please know there‚Äôs a way to rewire your attention. Books, podcasts, and the right tools can reset the system. It changed me, and I believe it can

I got a Ninja Luxe Cafe in Feb & although it makes ok coffee I feel like its cleverness limits the quality of coffee you can get out of it, for example I‚Äôve started weighing the bean output & it varies each time between 16-19g & 6/10 times I am either manually grinding more or taking some out.

I tried only adding 18g to the hopper & grinding until it‚Äôs gone through but beans got stuck in the hopper & it‚Äôs awkward as the machine needs to be pulled out to manually fill. 

Even though I have it on the 2:1 setting I nearly always get 45-50ml of espresso with any bean which pours between 25-35s (pump on to off). If I grind finer it chokes up or takes longer 45s+ with comparable output. It pours well initially but just seems to pull too long by like 5s. 

The image is typical of the drink I am able to make, current beans are Union with a roast date of 26/08/25. 

I was looking at 2nd hand Barista Express or Bambino & getting a separate grinder but the Bambino seems to be just as expensive 2nd hand as the Barista, well locally to me anyway (¬£200-250). 

Anything I can try with the luxe or would I get better results with another machine? Would a puck screen help in anyway or a better tamp? At this point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a faulty machine, but seems to be a common theme that if you really want to get the best results then this machine doesn‚Äôt seem to perform above ok. 

If machine would be better, what would be my best bet? I don‚Äôt want to pay more than I can get for the Ninja. 

The other consideration is my wife likes the Ninja because it‚Äôs easy, & it‚Äôs part of the reason I got it because she likes a cold coffee but never actually uses those features.

I've been wearing hoodies for as long as I can remember, and recently I decided to dig deep into the great debate of fleece vs cotton hoodies. After trying both extensively, I thought I'd share my experience to help others make an informed decision.

Let me start with cotton hoodies. They're like that reliable friend who's always there for you. Cotton is breathable, feels natural against your skin, and gets softer with each wash. I love how they look casual yet put-together, perfect for running errands or meeting friends for coffee. However, they can get pretty heavy when wet and take forever to dry. Plus, they tend to lose their shape over time.

Now, fleece hoodies are a different story altogether. I recently picked up this amazing fleece hoodie (https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) and I'm honestly impressed. The material is incredibly light yet keeps me super warm. It's like being wrapped in a cloud! The moisture-wicking properties are fantastic - perfect for those morning jogs or when you're caught in unexpected rain.

The biggest advantage of fleece? It's incredibly low maintenance. Just toss it in the washer, and it comes out looking brand new. Cotton usually needs more careful washing and can shrink if you're not careful. Though, I should mention that fleece can sometimes create static electricity, and some cheaper versions can pill after a few washes.

One thing I've noticed is that fleece hoodies are generally better for outdoor activities. Whether I'm hiking, camping, or just walking my dog on a chilly morning, my fleece hoodie (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) keeps me at the perfect temperature without feeling bulky.

Price-wise, quality cotton hoodies can be cheaper initially, but fleece often lasts longer and maintains its shape better. If you're looking for something that'll last multiple seasons without losing its warmth or comfort, fleece might be the way to go.

Here's my practical advice: if you live in a place with varying temperatures or do a lot of outdoor activities, go for fleece. If you're more about that casual, everyday wear and don't mind some extra maintenance, cotton is still a solid choice.

Remember though, not all fleece or cotton hoodies are created equal. Quality matters a lot, so don't just go for the cheapest option you find. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!

Hope this helps you make a better decision! Let me know if you have any questions about either type - I'm always happy to share more from my experience.",1,1759042991.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

* We‚Äôve heard private cabs charge around ‚Çπ6,000‚Äì8,000 per day for this kind of itinerary (depending on vehicle type, distance, fuel).
* Are there other convenient or cost-effective ways to travel for a group this size?

I know it was from him because I had been celibate for three years before meeting him, whereas he never got tested and had a much higher body count prior to dating me. When this first happened he broke down crying, apologized, and promised he‚Äôd take care of me for life. But the same week I was recovering from the sores and still reeling from the shock of realizing my life was permanently changed, he went off on a bachelor‚Äôs trip, got drunk, and barely checked in on me. 

We tried going to couples therapy, but after three sessions we almost broke up because he wanted to start a family and I wasn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôd be a reliable father. Shortly after we talked about how our futures plans might not align, I got pregnant. Instead of supporting me, he told me it was ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù to move in together, even though I was living alone, dealing with morning sickness and joint pain. We took a week apart to decide whether to keep the baby. When I asked him what fatherhood meant to him, he said it was about ‚Äúplaying with the kid‚Äù and relying on his family to help raise it. It became clear he wanted kids and marriage mostly because he was afraid of dying alone and wanted a ‚Äúlegacy.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt feel like a healthy environment for a child, so I chose abortion.

After the surgery, he stayed over at my place but the next day asked me to go get lunch for us because he was ‚Äútoo busy with work.‚Äù Then he left for a family trip to Croatia, didn‚Äôt tell his parents what happened, and left me to go through the aftermath alone. While he was away, I got severe food poisoning and at my follow-up with the gynae, I found out the abortion hadn‚Äôt been fully successful. I had to take stronger pills to try to ‚Äúclear it‚Äù, and because it was unsafe to do it alone, I finally had to tell my family so they could support me. Even then, the pills didn‚Äôt work and I had to go through another surgery. This time he showed up, but that same week I got laid off from my job. Three days later, he insisted we go out to this night festival even though I wasn‚Äôt feeling up for it, got annoyed that I wasn‚Äôt dressed up, and snapped at me saying ‚Äúwhy are you still sad?‚Äù

Despite everything, I stayed because I was terrified no one would love me again with herpes because I live in a more traditional Asian society and there‚Äôs a lot of stigma around it. Over time, the relationship just deteriorated. He refused to go back to couples therapy and told me I needed therapy alone because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt over it.‚Äù Anytime I tried to bring up the betrayal, he dismissed me with, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so long already, why aren‚Äôt you over it?‚Äù But the truth is, there was never accountability or real healing from him so I stopped feeling safe with him and withdrew from physical intimacy and stopped being so present in the relationship. I must admit that I was not in the best mental or emotional state in the last year of our relationship because of everything that happened and it became quite toxic, so I take shared responsibility in the relationship slowly breaking down and I wonder if I had been asking too much or my needs too heavy.

Eventually, I broke up with him because he kept pressuring me into sex, even during painful flare-ups, claiming it was about ‚Äúhis needs.‚Äù On top of that, he constantly pressured me into hangouts with his friends and family because he was obsessed with his image. But at the same time, he told me I couldn‚Äôt get too close to his friends (since one was still in touch with his ex), which made me feel like nothing more than an accessory for appearances. When I resisted going because these interactions would feel shallow and I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to establish any real friendship, he flipped it and said I wasn‚Äôt supportive enough as a partner.

Now that I‚Äôm finally out of the relationship, I feel like he was never truly accountable for what happened or the pain he caused me. Part of me wants to make a video exposing him, or even write a letter to his parents so they know the truth. Another part of me wonders if I should just let it go and focus on healing, but it‚Äôs been 5 months since the breakup and I just keep cycling through these intense bouts of anger where it feels so unfair that he‚Äôs moving on and might do this to someone else down the line while maintaining his ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù image. 

Even when we broke up, he said he still loved me, that I was his best friend, and that he‚Äôd be there for me if I needed to go see the doctor for more medication for the herpes. I tried asking him 2 months into the break up if we could try again properly (because he‚Äôd asked to meet up for coffee and cried when he saw me, made references to our ‚Äúinside jokes‚Äù and was reminding me of the good parts of our relationship, so it made me feel like he reflected - stupid of me I know, please don‚Äôt judge me) but he said he couldn‚Äôt give me what I wanted, that he was starting a new job and needed to prioritize that, and he didn‚Äôt want me to wait for him but yet he said ‚Äúmaybe we could reconnect and have a conversation in the future‚Äù (which I know was just his selfish, avoidant way of fulling saying ‚Äúno‚Äù). Then after 3 months of no contact, I reached out during a flare-up and he was polite but didn‚Äôt really offer any help besides sending me a link to a clinic that might be cheaper then proceeded to tell me about how stressed he is at his new job. I know it‚Äôs not exactly like he has to be as close as he was before but it sure sucks to feel like I‚Äôm left with this burden all on my own and I don‚Äôt know how to move through it.

With users often reusing passwords across services, a single data breach can compromise multiple accounts. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video accounts are particularly valuable targets due to their payment information and personal viewing data.

**Malware-Infected Streaming Apps:** Fake streaming applications and browser extensions promise free access to premium content but actually install malware that steals personal information, cryptocurrency wallets, and banking credentials. These malicious apps often mimic legitimate streaming services with convincing interfaces.

**Public WiFi Exploitation:** Streaming on unsecured public networks exposes your login credentials and personal data to cybercriminals using packet sniffing tools. Hotel, coffee shop, and airport WiFi networks are particularly vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks targeting streaming traffic.

**ISP Traffic Analysis:** Internet service providers can monitor and analyze your streaming habits, building detailed profiles of your viewing preferences. This data is often sold to advertisers or used for targeted marketing, raising significant privacy concerns.

# Real-World Streaming Security Incidents

Recent cybersecurity incidents highlight the real risks facing streaming users:

* **Supply Chain Attacks:** In May 2025, the Everest Group launched cyberattacks against multiple organizations through a compromised SAP SuccessFactors service provider, affecting companies that manage streaming services and content delivery networks.
* **Biometric Data Breaches:** A genetic-testing company breach in late 2023 exposed data from nearly 7 million users, demonstrating how interconnected digital services can compromise multiple aspects of your digital life, including streaming account security.
* **AI-Powered Phishing:** Cybercriminals now use artificial intelligence to create convincing phishing emails that appear to come from legitimate streaming services, tricking users into revealing account credentials and payment information.

# Essential Security Practices for Safe Streaming

# Protecting Your Streaming Accounts

**Implement Strong, Unique Passwords:** Use a different, complex password for each streaming service. Your Netflix password should never be the same as your Disney+ or Amazon Prime credentials. Consider using a reputable password manager to generate and store secure passwords.

**Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Most major streaming platforms now offer 2FA options. This adds a crucial second layer of security that prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

**Regular Account Monitoring:** Check your streaming accounts monthly for:

* Unrecognized devices in your account settings
* Viewing history you don't recognize
* Changes to payment methods or personal information
* New profiles or users added without your knowledge

**Secure Payment Methods:** Use credit cards rather than debit cards for streaming subscriptions, as they offer better fraud protection. Consider virtual credit card numbers for additional security.

# Network Security for Streaming

**Home Network Protection:** Secure your home WiFi with WPA3 encryption and a strong password. Regularly update your router firmware and change default login credentials. Create a separate guest network for visitors to prevent access to devices connected to your main network.

**Public WiFi Precautions:** Never access streaming accounts on unsecured public networks. If you must stream while traveling, use a reputable VPN to encrypt your traffic and protect your credentials from interception.

**DNS Security:** Consider using secure DNS services like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Quad9 (9.9.9.9) to prevent DNS hijacking attacks that could redirect you to malicious streaming sites.

# Device Security Best Practices

**Regular Software Updates:** Keep your streaming devices, apps, and operating systems updated with the latest security patches. Enable automatic updates when possible to ensure you're protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.

**Official App Sources:** Only download streaming apps from official sources like the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Amazon Appstore. Avoid sideloading apps from unknown sources, as these may contain malware.

**Secure Streaming Device Configuration:**

* Disable unnecessary features like microphone access for streaming apps
* Review and limit app permissions regularly
* Use strong PINs or passwords for device access
* Enable screen locks on mobile devices used for streaming

# How VPNs Enhance Streaming Security and Privacy

# Legitimate Privacy Benefits for Streamers

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) serves as a crucial cybersecurity tool for streaming enthusiasts, providing several legitimate security and privacy benefits:

**Traffic Encryption:** VPNs encrypt all your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. This is particularly important when streaming on public WiFi networks, where cybercriminals often lurk.

**IP Address Masking:** By hiding your real IP address, VPNs prevent streaming platforms, advertisers, and malicious actors from tracking your location and building detailed profiles of your viewing habits.

**DNS Leak Protection:** Quality VPNs prevent DNS leaks that could expose which streaming sites you visit, even when using encrypted connections.

# Protection Against ISP Throttling

Internet service providers often engage in **bandwidth throttling**‚Äîdeliberately slowing down your internet connection when they detect high-bandwidth activities like streaming. This practice can result in:

* Reduced video quality
* Increased buffering times
* Interrupted viewing experiences
* Longer load times for content

A VPN encrypts your traffic, preventing your ISP from identifying streaming activity and implementing throttling measures. This can significantly improve your streaming experience, especially during peak usage hours.

# Security on Public Networks

Public WiFi networks pose significant risks for streaming users:

**Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Cybercriminals can position themselves between your device and the WiFi router, intercepting all data transmitted, including streaming account credentials.

**Fake WiFi Hotspots:** Attackers create fake WiFi networks with names similar to legitimate ones (like ""Starbucks\_WiFi\_Free"") to trick users into connecting.

**Packet Sniffing:** Unencrypted public networks allow anyone with basic technical knowledge to capture and analyze network traffic, potentially revealing your streaming account information.

A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for all your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone monitoring the network.

# Finding and Accessing Content Safely and Legally

# Official Streaming Platform Security

When looking for specific content like the acclaimed German series ""Generation War,"" always prioritize official streaming platforms that implement robust security measures:

**Legitimate Streaming Options for Generation War:**

* **Amazon Prime Video (US):** Features the complete series with professional subtitles and HD quality
* **Apple TV:** Offers rental and purchase options with secure payment processing
* **Netflix UK:** Currently streams the series (availability may vary by region)
* **Hoopla and Plex:** Provide free, legal access with library card authentication

These platforms implement:

* **Advanced encryption** for payment processing and personal data protection
* **Content delivery networks (CDNs)** that ensure secure, high-quality streaming
* **Regular security audits** and compliance with industry standards
* **Customer support** for account security issues

# Discovering International Content Through Legitimate Channels

Rather than resorting to potentially unsafe methods to access international content, consider these legitimate approaches:

**Official Platform Expansion:** Many streaming services are expanding their international content libraries. Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ regularly add international series and films to their catalogs.

**Specialized Streaming Services:** Platforms like:

* **Walter Presents (All 4):** Focuses on international drama series
* **MHz Choice:** Specializes in European content
* **Acorn TV:** Features British and international programming
* **Topic:** Offers curated international films and series

**Digital Purchase and Rental:** Services like Apple TV, Google Play Movies, and Vudu often provide international content for purchase or rental when it's not available on subscription platforms.

# The Security Risks of Illegal Streaming

While it might be tempting to use unauthorized streaming sites, they pose serious cybersecurity risks:

**Malware Distribution:** Illegal streaming sites often bundle malware with video players or require suspicious browser plugins that can compromise your device.

**Data Harvesting:** These sites may collect personal information, browsing habits, and device details for sale to third parties or use in future attacks.

**Legal Consequences:** Beyond security risks, accessing copyrighted content through unauthorized means can result in legal penalties, including fines and lawsuits.

**Poor Security Practices:** Illegal streaming sites rarely implement proper security measures, making users vulnerable to data breaches and identity theft.

# Choosing the Right Security Tools for Streaming

# Essential VPN Features for Streaming Security

When selecting a VPN for streaming security, prioritize these critical features:

**Strong Encryption Standards:** Look for VPNs using AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by governments and financial institutions.

**No-Logs Policy:** Choose providers with independently audited no-logs policies to ensure your streaming activity isn't recorded or stored.

1nshfa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1nshfa4/mils_health_starts_to_deteriorate_and_she_blames/,MIL‚Äôs health starts to deteriorate - and she blames DH,"MIL‚Äôs health has started to deteriorate. MIL (66) has always triumphantly come back from doctor‚Äôs visits declaring there‚Äôs nothing wrong with her - her blood work is all fine and she‚Äôs healthy. Now this is despite her steady increase in weight over the past 5 years in particular, her non-existent history of exercise and her diet - which is relatively healthy when you look at the main meals but is heavily substituted with coffee and sweets. 

Which brings us to her recent issues - high blood pressure, something going on with a hiatus hernia and oesophagus - suddenly it‚Äôs like a switch has been flipped. 

After years of DH and I pushing and pushing - why don‚Äôt you walk to the bus stop? (It‚Äôs 500m and she DRIVES) - why don‚Äôt you get an indoor bike if the weather‚Äôs preventing you from walking/you don‚Äôt want to walk alone? Why don‚Äôt you see the exercise physiologist to help you get started? The list of suggestions and attempts goes on. 

Anyway- now the doctor is worried, suddenly it‚Äôs - ‚ÄúI told you I wanted the bike! so just buy it, why didn‚Äôt you buy it‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why he has to buy it? She‚Äôs even paying for it but he has to buy it? He‚Äôs sent her what to buy, but he has to buy it?) this is also mixed in with - ‚Äúbut it can‚Äôt be anything too hard or I won‚Äôt want to do it‚Äù  - woman - this is sitting on your a** and moving your legs - it will be less demanding than walking if you want it to be. I can‚Äôt see this actually helping you now in this circumstance you‚Äôve got yourself in. 

I simply don‚Äôt see why DH has to get things sorted for her. And neither does he. But now that she‚Äôs actually in poor health- how CAN you say no? Even when it‚Äôs illogical. She‚Äôs completely capable - just lazy. 

Has anyone else been in a similar circumstance? All attempts at trying to prevent illness get brushed aside and suddenly when things go south, you‚Äôre blamed for not trying harder (or doing it for them?). ",5,1759041676.0,motherinlawsfromhell,4,1.0,False

1nsh9ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/elliottsmith/comments/1nsh9ay/stickman_and_roman_candle_hit_home_for_me_long/,"Stickman and Roman Candle hit home for me. (Long, long read)","I love Stickman, it‚Äôs catchy, layered, has cool/experimental ornamentation, and a satisfying climax that has a ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù that sheds light on the source of his pain in a heartbreaking yet triumphant way.

Roman Candle is really good too ‚Äî the chord progression and overblown guitar line played on top of it is mystical and unique. The contrast of ‚Äúwant[ing] to give him pain‚Äù with Elliott‚Äôs tender voice is all too relatable for me.

I am a gentle and sensitive person, like Elliott portrays himself to be through his music, and I make similar music as well at times. I love peace, which is why I get upset when others don‚Äôt. I feel very deeply when others are suffering, and everyday I don‚Äôt understand why someone‚Äôs tears aren‚Äôt enough for some people to stop hurting others.

All this to say sometimes I feel like a fraud. I claim to be so gentle and loving, but sometimes I remember what my dad did to me, my sister, and my stepmother, and the lyrics to Roman Candle just resonate so much. Elliott showed me that gentle people can have ungentle thoughts, and it‚Äôs a natural reaction to the pain.

Some people think if you were never physically or sexually abused, whatever happened to you didn‚Äôt really matter. The truth is, when someone you‚Äôre financially dependent on, constantly screams at you to where spit is flying out and they can‚Äôt form words, or threatens to take away your car or money, or is constantly threatening to call the police on you, just because you ‚Äúdisobeyed him,‚Äù or because you smoked weed, it takes a psychological toll.

I had a psychotic break in part due to my father‚Äôs verbal abuse and psychological terrorism. I was also suicidal on and off for like 15 years. I am now on antidepressants and mood stabilizers, and I‚Äôm doing much better. But I still remember how my dad attacked my stepmom, how (a few drops) of her blood was on the floor, and how my 3 year old sister, so innocent, tried to clean it up to be helpful.

I remember when I tried to protect my mom and she pushed me out of the way because she wanted to continue to fight him. 

I remember how my dad verbally abused my sister and tried to control how she dressed, to the point she attempted suicide, and they had to pump her stomach. She is now fiercely loyal to him, because since my doctor dad gives us infinite money (I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs nice), nothing else matters.

My sister felt so unloved, she tried to bash her head in with a coffee mug, thinking it would get my dad to stop screaming at her.

His reaction? 

He told her to keep doing it. She did, until she realized the only one that cared about her was her.

Even if she forgives him, I never will. I‚Äôm a Roman Candle. My head is full of flames.

And I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Go see a therapist?

I did. My 78 year old Republican therapist thinks I deserved the abuse because I ‚Äúacted up‚Äù by smoking weed, and that because my dad cries ‚Äúin fear of my future,‚Äù he truly loves me. If he loved me so much, every time I told him I hated him and what he did to me, he‚Äôd feel remorse instead of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just saying that because you‚Äôre on drugs!‚Äù (Another lie, I just hate people who abuse me, and he‚Äôs in denial that his son could hate his guts).

When he doesn‚Äôt care about my tears. When he doesn‚Äôt understand the weed use in part was to help deal with the misery he inflicted ‚Äî to this day I‚Äôm not even allowed to have friends over at my house (because men are inherently predators according to my parents, and they have ‚Äúyoung daughters in the house‚Äù). 

When he doesn‚Äôt care about my sister attempting suicide. When he gets angry and tries to punish me by taking everything away, just because I said ‚Äúyou abused me.‚Äù I mean, I get it. No one wants to be called an abuser, even if it‚Äôs true. But he could try having some God damn shame.

I‚Äôm a Stickman, I live with one dimension dead. The angry dimension, which I have to keep repressed, until I can make enough money and leave Texas, just like Elliott did.

Yeah, I was raised in Texas all my life too. But the 2020s twist on this alternate version of Elliott (I wish) is I‚Äôm non-binary, too, so this state is fucked for me on several levels.

I quit weed, and Twilight helps me stay off it (wanna have a girlfriend someday, not already be ‚Äúsomebody‚Äôs (weed‚Äôs) baby.‚Äù

You know what else is cool? I‚Äôm 32. I think about these next 2 years, I wanna make at least one album as good as X/O. I‚Äôve made an album I‚Äôm proud of, but I can do better. I keep a fake version of Elliott in my head, to talk to and make me feel appreciated. I wanna live and survive for my own happiness, and because someone like me (and much better than me, of course) didn‚Äôt get to.

I just have to be ‚Äúa good soldier, and swallow my sword.‚Äù In three years, I can be gone from here if I play my cards right. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not a perfect son. But no one deserves this. 

But I should just shut up, because of the infinite money, right? Well, maybe I should. Tell my dad he abused me and he comes back with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ungrateful.‚Äù

Well, maybe I am. I love my room. It‚Äôs peaceful and safe and enables my creative expression. He bought me my guitar. So I should just. Shut. Up.

But sometimes I‚Äôm sitting here, just doing nothing, trying to study, and it all comes back to me. Random agitation. Aggressively arguing with ghosts in my room over things that ended months or years ago, where, this time, I ‚Äúwin‚Äù the convo with perfect zingers.

All this to say I was ashamed of myself. Because I feel all this anger, but I claim to be gentle and peace-loving. But Elliott let me see that part of me actually makes perfect sense.

Anyway, I‚Äôm done now. Sorry if this was too much, or poorly organized. It‚Äôs just that, as I got older, I realized there were a few similarities between me and Elliott, and I thought since we all love him, maybe I could get a ‚Äúdamn, that sucks,‚Äù too.

Well, you don‚Äôt have to. I‚Äôm all cleaned out now. Just had to say something, because my therapist thinks I deserved it for smoking weed, and can‚Äôt say it to my conservative patriarchal family. I hate how people worship suits and manhood. Yes, I‚Äôll find a new therapist.

Anyway, here‚Äôs Wonderwall. If I got you curious about my music, you can listen to it here, but to be clear self-promo wasn‚Äôt the point of this, just sharing if you want. 

The one that sounds like the most like Elliott is Track 14. Fans of Elliott may also enjoy Tracks 12, 11, and 3. 

Track 13 is pretty bad, but interesting.

Be well everyone. I love you all.

this place is pretty much the same one i came from. bits and pieces of it look like home, just obscured in some unnatural way i can't put my finger on. things go on as normal, people live their lives with others, nothing special. that's exactly what terrifies me about it.

there's something itching at the back of my skull that tells me that something's off. i don't belong here. everyone knows it, but no one will say anything. i feel eyes from all over the place, like i'm a human alien. i thought i knew the way back, but it took me even deeper. i have no idea what i'm doing anymore. my brain feels like mush, like there's a heavy fog inside my skull that i just can't get past.

i'm not safe here, and i can never leave.

certain details in this world are impossible for me to make out. there are signs with written words that everyone else can understand, but somehow i can't even wrap my mind around it all. streets are flipped backwards, maps are impossible to decipher. my phone doesn't even work here, i can't even get a signal. i feel so lost.

i've had to sleep in abandoned buildings and steal from grocery stores just to survive. not like i have much of an appetite anymore, or an ability to sleep for that matter. there's always this everpresent sense of danger here that i can't escape from. i close my eyes and i hear voices taunting me, reminding me of my worst fears, threatening to do horrible things to me or convincing me to do those things to myself. i don't have the drive to sleep anymore. i just keep trying to piece together what led me here, just to keep myself somewhat sane.

the last moment i remember from my previous life was coming home after a long day at work. i felt like shit that day. the manual labor job i did to barely make rent was killing me. i remember my whole body aching by the time i got home. i remember taking a shower, standing under the hot water and replaying all the events from that day in my head. as the warm water ran over the back of my head, onto the sore bones and pulled muscles around my body, all the stupid mistakes i made were flashing before my eyes when i closed them. all of which seem inconsequential now. i can't even remember what i was so upset about back then. i don't think it even matters. maybe it never did. whatever...

i remember getting out of the shower, drying off with a towel, and putting my clothes on. i remember going to the mirror and wiping all the fog from it. i went to put deodorant on, brush my teeth, do all the normal nighttime things. i took some pain meds to help with all the soreness my body had collected from the day. i felt a sickness coming on, unsure if i caught a bug or just felt the collapse of all this long work and lack of sleep catching up to me, so i took some allergy meds to try and nip it in the bud.

i vaguely remember thinking of something this girl i worked with said about me. i had heard it through another coworker of mine, and it really upset me. i can't remember what it was anymore, but i know it left a really deep impact. she was someone i had real loving feelings for, but couldn't express myself properly at the time. i think i came across way worse than i had meant to, and i felt awful about it. she got the worst impression of me ever. i felt like such a coward for how i dealt with the whole situation. i remember wishing i could see her again, just to set the record straight between us. even still, i felt like i could never face her anymore. her image kept entering my mind, and i could no longer tell if it was a reminder or a punishment.

every day that i'm stuck here, my mind feels like it unravels more and more. it feels like the fog in my skull is starting to extend out onto the world, or at least into my vision. everything looks and feels hazy and disjointed. i'll close my eyes and suddenly transport to another place, without the memory of how i even got there. sometimes i'll look down at my hands moving and see light trails emanating from them. the way time and space operate here is insane.

i started to feel more of a sinister presence in the crowds of people i aimlessly trudge my way around. everyone seems like they have this faint dark aura around them, like something just outside of their form is stealing all the light around them. sometimes i'll hear those voices reappear all around me in a subdued way, like everyone is talking behind my back, whispering jokes and insults at my expense, telling me i'm a waste of life. i'll feel those stark, evil stares all around my person more and more until everyone eventually disappears into their comfortable homes. i'll eventually find another place to sit down, try to get some sort of rest. and every night, the voices get louder, more menacing, more dangerous. i'll open my eyes and no one is there. just a thick malaise over everything.

my mind is starting to fail me. i need to get out of here. how did i get here? shake off the voices. think...

i had spit out my toothpaste and washed my hands in the sink, before looking back up at the mirror. the fog was clearing up a bit from the fan being on, but it still clung to the edges like a vignette. the only thing i could see clearly was my ugly, awful likeness reflected back at me. i remember gazing at the small details in my reflection's face, pointing out all the hideous details back to myself. the recession pattern in my hair that made me look like i was sporting a combover in a futile attempt to hide the obvious. all the wrinkles in my face deeper than they should be for my age, highlighting all the stress and exhaustion i've been under. all the yellow pigment collecting on my teeth from coffee and cigarettes. the uneven nature of my eyes and facial details, looking more and more awkward and distorted as i studied it all. my gaze fell deeper and deeper into all the details, everything around me just fading in the background. i remember...

i woke up again. but this time i didn't really feel like i was awake. my eyes still felt shut. matter of fact, my whole body wouldn't move. it was like i was in a straight jacket, struggling to get any of my limbs moving. as i looked forward with my mind's eye, where my reflection was a moment ago loomed a dark, shadowy figure hovering right above my face. all i could make out were his piercing red eyes, like lights shining from the pitch black void of his shape. all around him was darkness and flashing, like someone turned on a strobe light in the middle of the room i was in. the light reflected from all the shattered glass on the floor flashed right back in my face.

i tried to scream but my mouth and lungs failed me. i struggled to move my arms, legs, shoulders, anything just to get out of this nightmare. i couldn't tell for sure, but it felt like this figure was pinning me down to the ground as he spoke to me, sounding like he was whispering and shouting at the same time:

""you're gonna die here if you keep going""

before i had the chance to respond, or even understand what he meant, my limbs finally listened to my brain and i shook myself out of it. my body lunged forward from off the dirty mattress i was laying on, and my lungs breathed in a great big gasp of air. my eyes opened wide and saw the morning sun peer through the dilapidated windows in this empty church. i sat there to catch my breath for a second, let my heartbeat settle for a bit, wondering what the hell just happened.

""keep going""? going where? deeper into this world? i'm trying to find my way out, but i keep finding myself digging deeper into it. this isn't right, none of this is right. everything is backwards. how the hell do i...

that's it. the mirror. i remember now.

i lunged forward with what little energy i collected from that faint bit of sleep i somehow managed to catch, and rushed straight to the bathroom next to me. it was all in complete disrepair; faucets didn't work, dirt and grime everywhere, flies buzzing around the toilet clearly used from whoever squatted here last, with no water to flush it down. it was heinous, but i had to face it all to know. i closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and turned to the mirror next to me. shattered, broken, but still reflecting the room around me. everything but my own body.

what? this isn't right, why can't i see myself? what the fuck am i supposed to do now? wasn't staring into my reflection the whole reason why i found myself here in the first place? i can't find it anymore. what am i, a vampire? what the hell is going on???

i left the church, breaking through the great big wooden board that i had slipped through stealthily the night before, pieces of snapped wood flying everywhere. i had to find another mirror. i had to keep trying.

i ran. i ran so far that my legs were burning and my chest ached. i felt a stitch coming on in my left side and i pushed past it. i bumrushed every bathroom i could find, in every building i came across. nothing. no reflection to find. absolutely useless.

i kept running, scrambling to find mirrors anywhere i could. i noticed all the stares around me, all the piercing eyes and nasty comments, growing more loud and intense. i noticed that dark aura around everyone growing deeper and thicker around them.

over and over again.
i'd blink and find a mirror without my reflection.
i'd blink and find myself running.
blink and see people staring.
blink, the auras grew.
blink, there's another mirror, no reflection.

running.
so much running.

i felt so exasperated, with nothing but my sheer panic to keep me going. the sky got darker again. the fog came back, even thicker this time. everything seemed so jumbled up and led to nowhere. lights started strobing around me again. i felt like how i did in that waking nightmare, completely dizzy and trapped with no way out. no control over my body anymore. it kept running without me even telling it to.

in the midst of all this panic, i noticed those auras had seemingly combined and formed their own autonomy. big dark shadows shaped like people, with nothing but red eyes piercing from their heads. they were now the ones chasing after me. i could hear their voices and threats ring louder and louder in my ears until they all surrounded me. i wasn't running towards anything anymore; i was running from them.

their stares burned into my flesh. their words brought up all my deepseated fears. they told me to give up, to break one of those mirrors i've been so desperate to find myself in and slice my own throat with one of the shards. i couldn't escape them. i couldn't even fathom where i was heading.

i turned a corner on the street, opened a door in the building next to me, and found myself walking out of another door into another street corner. none of the geography here made any sense at all. i was completely losing my mind and all sense of direction. i felt so hopeless and worthless then. why can't i do anything right?

i never confessed to being religious, but i felt like my god had completely abandoned me. there is no god in this world. i'm just lost in this complete state of limbo, with nowhere else to go.

just then, i turned and saw an old church with a great big wooden plank in place of the door. i looked around to see if anyone was there, and i slipped in as quietly as i could. i didn't want anyone to know i was here. i closed the plank door behind me and made sure my tracks were completely covered.

when i walked in, i found an old, empty room with nothing in it but dead bugs, broken shards of stained glass, and a gross, beat-up mattress. there weren't even any pews on the floor. aren't those supposed to be nailed nailed into the floor? 

before i could think too hard about it, my legs started buckling under my body. i went over to the mattress and collapsed on top of it. it smelled awful. everything in this room smelled awful. i looked up at the what was left of the ceiling, big naked wooden planks half-chewed from termites, covered in spiderwebs and mold from rainwater seeping through the cracks. the whole thing looked like it was gonna collapse on top of me eventually. maybe that'd be for the best. at least i wouldn't have to live in a world like this anymore.

somehow i passed out. exhaustion took hold amongst those awful voices that bounce around in my head like a ring echo, until it all turned to noise and feedback loops.

i woke up in the middle of the night, feeling a presence in my room, i looked down and saw a lit cigar held in front of my face. i looked up, and there he was.

i jumped back in the mattress, startled and worried he might hold me down again. he seemed completely unfazed by this. he just stared at me with those searing red eyes, but for some reason i felt no malice in his presence. i took a breath, keeping my gaze pointed to him, trying hard to be ready for anything while doubtful of my ability to be. i took the cigar and, with seemingly no other choice of action, took a great big hit from it.

the sensation burned my throat and i coughed a good amount, but i felt a buzz in my head that helped me breathe easy for a while. i looked up at him inquisitively, critically, never quite letting my guard down fully. was this a gesture made in good faith? why did he look and feel so evil? what did he mean by what he said before? did he know something about this place that i didn't?

before i could say anything, he spoke to me again in that same voice that somehow whispered and shouted all at once.

""i told you not to keep going""

my head shot back in disbelief. ""are you kidding? where was i supposed to go? how do i get out of here?""

he took the cigar from my hand and ashed it on the floor. ""there is no way out anymore.""

my jaw dropped. i struggled to find the meaning in those words, much less trust them. he could tell.

""you should've listened to me"" he said as he passed the cigar back in my direction.

i took it in my hand but didn't do anything with it, just let it hang there like a limp noodle. i was in complete shock. i couldn't understand. i wouldn't. with the last bit of courage and strength i could muster, i stood up and yelled everything i had been thinking up to that point.

""are you kidding me? what was i supposed to do? what do i do now? how am i even supposed to trust you? you're just like everyone else here, just following me around and calling me out, telling me to just give up. how can i give up? how can i leave behind all the people i knew and loved back where i came from? what the FUCK do i do now???""

in all my frantic energy, hot tears started streaming down my face. my mouth filled with spit as i shouted all those words to this entity, this shadowperson in front of me, someone i could barely even tell was real besides his obvious interactions with me. i didn't even know what was real anymore.

the man took a great big sigh and stood up next to me, then turned and walked towards the broken windows of the room. ""come here, take a look outside.""

in all my astonishment, i saw his deep breath and raised him one of my own. i took a second to calm down and regain my sanity, then followed his lead and looked outside, through all the smashed-in stained glass portraits that barely resembled anything anymore. i could barely tell what i was seeing amongst all the blurry, distorted, impossible streets. everyone had left. it felt like we were the only two beings in the whole world. i was sure that would change by the morning, but in all the confusion and messiness of the world, i somehow felt a sense of peace. i took another drag of the cigar and passed it back to him as he continued on.

""this world reflects what you bring to it. it is not a world of hostility, but of indifference. it is simply a mirror. it reflects your confusion, your aimlessness, your self-hatred. you came with all of those things and nothing else, so you will get nothing else from here.""

i took a second to think back at what i could've brought with me. all that pain, sorrow, anxiety that i had felt in my old world had increased tenfold since i came here. all those feelings i was so used to, now i felt i could never escape from. if this being was telling the truth, that notion was right.

""i'm sorry to break it to you this way. i have no power over this place. i don't do anything but observe. i've seen you in your darkest moments, your endless running. in a way, this world is a microcosm of what you felt before. you couldn't leave that feeling behind. you still can't, and that's why you will never return. you'll spend your last waking moments running from your own fears and self-torment, and that'll be the mark you leave behind.""

with every last shred of hope fading away, i turned to him and asked desperately ""there's really no way out? are you sure?""

he turned back to me to meet my gaze. ""what's the one thing you want in the whole world, more than anything? more than getting out of this place and back to your world?""

i thought for a moment, but it didn't take me long. ""there's someone i wanna see again, but i don't think i ever will. i don't expect anything from her anyway. i just want her to know that i'm sorry, and i hope she's okay.""

the shadowman laughed to himself and shook his head a bit. ""i'm sure she knows that more than you realize. don't worry about it. just think of the good, and keep that with you in your final moments here.""

he put out what was left of the cigar on the windowsill, embers still burning out, a smoke trail leading to the broken curling above us. as he walked away, he mentioned one last thing to me out the side of his mouth.

""find your god. not the one you pray to, the one you carry""

i blinked, and he was gone. it was morning again. all the somber peace i had felt in that moment left with him.

i stood there, wondering why i had even felt that peace with him in the first place. he was one of *them*, wasn't he? was he on my side or was he against me? or, true to his word, was he just as indifferent as he said this world really is? i didn't know what to think anymore. i no longer had time to.

the voices grew louder again. the figures reappeared on the street. i could feel them all staring at me through the window, locked onto me even from the small view they had through what was left of this destroyed place. the strobing started again, filling the whole room with this blinding, staticky, uncomfortable sensation. i couldn't take it anymore.

i ran to the bathroom, past the clogged toilet and all the flies surrounding it. i looked up at the broken mirror and still couldn't see myself in it. something snapped in my brain and i started laughing maniacally, barely able to stop myself to even breathe. then i let out a great big bloodcurdling scream and punched the mirror, shattering it even more. i kept hitting it with both of my fists, blood seeping out of my fingers, glass shards sticking out. i didn't care. i kept going. i started smashing my face against it, laughing and screaming as i went on. the mirror had completely fallen apart. i found one large blade of glass that fell into the sink, and i stopped myself.

memories started flashing by my eyes. not the bad ones i had been used to before, but the good ones i had forgotten about. the first time i had ever seen that girl at work. the time i had approached her, when we started talking and flirting together. the budding of true love coming into fruition. before all the complications of life had ruined it all. before all the mistakes and hurt feelings and things left unsaid. i saw her face, plain as day, right in front of me, as if she was really there.

i opened my eyes through all the blood pouring from my forehead. i picked up the blade and looked into the glass. i finally saw myself. i looked deep into my crazed expression, all the torn flesh and broken, mangled features. i started to wish i hadn't, but i couldn't look away. i gripped the blade in my fist, tearing into the skin behind my knuckles. i stared deep into myself and realized what i had become. i lost all hope.

Im a fool. For the first time in my life, I have zero plan. No savings, no roadmap, no hope just me, my brain, and a mountain of ideas.

A year ago I was different.
I biked 560‚ÄØkm from Oshawa to Montreal 5 days, pink single‚Äëspeed, sleeping rough, heat, rain, gravel, tent. One day I forgot to refill my water and two strangers came out of nowhere and saved me all the while scaring the shit out of me, giving me just enough water to make it through the day (about a bottles worth). That ride was supposed to be my redemption arc. It wasn‚Äôt.

Before that I self‚Äëadmitted to the hospital after spiralling on Zoloft. I‚Äôd been prescribed it for depression after a year of microdosing mushrooms (which sent me on a rollercoaster aswell), mixed with occasional edibles, felt like a destined success story, stacked cash, extended my reach with BNPL. Even signed up for online courses to potentially branch into mechanical engineering. Quit. Chased art instead pastels, charcoal, murals, TikToks. Everything ‚Äústarted‚Äù, nothing stuck.

Then came the storm.
Edibles every day.
Caffeine like a drug.
Two hours of sleep between warehouse shifts and midnight bike rides.
Garbage bags over the windows.
Discord & Social Media bans.
The internet telling me to admit myself.
Ten days in the open unit. Med switches. Nice people I literally cant remember the names of. Came out sober. Trained harder. Rode to Montreal. Planned to cross Canada next fuelled with change. Didn‚Äôt.

Now weed sparks my creativity but keeps me on a leash, coffee fuels it, then the crash kills me. Delusions. Dread. Meds off and on. Quality of life gone. Finances gone. Thousands in debt. Gear without a plan. 3D Printer, decent PC, Parts, Ideas without a future‚Ä¶ Im currently on medical leave from my part time job and cant see myself returning to work if im being honest. My job is over an hour bus ride away and returning will push me to my end if I don‚Äôt reach the point before I return.

Zero money. Zero way out.
But the delusional side of me still believes I could make it out, that‚Äôs what hurts the most.

So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to try to do if I don‚Äôt go missing in the process. I‚Äôm going to start documenting. The real stuff. The ideas, the failures, the weed, the debt, the little wins, build vlogs, tech or whatever. I‚Äôm going to post here on Reddit, YouTube when I work up the confidence, starting from literally zero dollars. If I can turn this into anything, a business, a job offer, a community, a reason to keep going then at least my mess wasn‚Äôt for nothing.

If you‚Äôve been here and made it out, tell me how.
If you‚Äôve got advice, a job lead, a mentorship, a way to collaborate, DM me.
If you just want to watch a 21‚Äëyear‚Äëold try to claw his way out of his own hole, follow along.

I don‚Äôt want pity. I want to build. I want to climb. I want to show that someone can go from zero to something, even with bipolar and a trail of self‚Äëinflicted chaos.

This is either the beginning of my final downfall or the start of my climb.",4,1759040386.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,3,1.0,False
1nsh23h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nsh23h/what_size_portable_generator_do_i_need_for_my_rv/,What size portable generator do I need for my RV?,"Hey fellow RV enthusiasts! I've been living the RV life for about 5 years now, and one of the most common questions I see from newcomers is about portable generators. After lots of trial and error (and a few mistakes along the way), I thought I'd share what I've learned about choosing the right generator size for your RV.

First things first - there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It really depends on what appliances you're planning to run. I learned this the hard way when I first started out with a generator that was too small for my needs.

Here's a quick breakdown of what you typically need:
- Small RV (under 32 feet): 2000-3000 watts
- Medium RV (32-38 feet): 3000-4000 watts
- Large RV (38+ feet): 4000+ watts

But wait! Before you rush to buy one, you need to calculate your actual power needs. Here's what I do:

1. List all your essential appliances
2. Add up their running watts
3. Factor in starting watts (especially for AC units)

For reference, here are some common RV appliance power needs:
- AC unit: 1500-3500 watts
- Microwave: 1000-1500 watts
- Coffee maker: 600-1200 watts
- Refrigerator: 400-1000 watts
- LED lights: 10-30 watts

I recently found some great deals on reliable portable generators here: https://athometouch.com/portable-generator

One crucial tip I learned: Always go slightly bigger than your calculated needs. You'll thank yourself later when you want to run multiple appliances simultaneously.

Here's my personal setup: I have a 3500-watt generator for my 34-foot RV. It comfortably runs my AC, fridge, and a few small appliances. I actually bought it from this seller: https://athometouch.com/portable-generator - they have competitive prices and great customer service.

Some other factors to consider:
- Noise level (especially important in campgrounds)
- Fuel efficiency
- Weight and portability
- Parallel capability
- Runtime per tank

Remember to check your RV's manual for specific power requirements. Also, don't forget to factor in altitude - generators lose about 3.5% power for every 1000 feet above sea level.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments - I'm always happy to share more details about my experiences with RV generators.

Stay safe and happy camping! üèïÔ∏è",1,1759040315.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False
1nsh0d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1nsh0d2/friends_arent_around_much_after_giving_birth/,Friends aren‚Äôt around much after giving birth?,"FTM with a 3 month old. 
When my friends found out I was pregnant majority where excited and always checking in and after I gave birth were coming to visit and such but initially gave me space after the first few weeks of me being home, which is understandable because I needed to settle in being at home with a little one of course! 

Now as time has gone on, I‚Äôve come to realize they sort of just have dropped off significantly. I understand everyone is busy, life is life and I thought it wouldn‚Äôt bother me, as I‚Äôve seen my friends and even family go through the period where no one calls or comes around after having children.

I‚Äôm more so a person now I don‚Äôt mind staying at home with my little family but I always make time for friends and did before pregnancy and even during but I‚Äôve really had to step back and see it does bother me / upset me that my friends aren‚Äôt there as much anymore, they generally don‚Äôt ask how things are going or how I‚Äôm travelling and I‚Äôm often the one reaching out nowadays. I do unfortunately, have PPA and PPD and am trying my best not to project this onto anyone and deal with it myself, by keeping what I‚Äôm feeling to myself as I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to anyone. 

Instead I try reach out often to say hey let‚Äôs catch up, me and Bub can travel out to you or even let‚Äôs meet up for a walk or some lunch, but nothing really is solid or it‚Äôs often postponed. 
I guess I just feel a bit alone in the sense sometimes you just need a friend (for me it‚Äôs not to talk about the negative things or be down in the dumps it‚Äôs more to be able to have a laugh and socialise) 
I feel on one hand I could just be reading into it to much, and that people are just genuinely busy with life as like I said life happens, but on the other hand I feel like I‚Äôm not interesting enough now that I have my baby. (I wouldn‚Äôt trade him for the world!) 

I don‚Äôt necessarily miss my life before pregnancy because it often felt like I was trying to fill a void, always out, couldn‚Äôt stay in one place for too long and always had to be doing something. 

This weekend particularly but I‚Äôm feeling a bit down as having social media I‚Äôve seen posts from my friends that they are all out overnight having a great time by the looks of it. While I don‚Äôt particularly miss going out and drinking, I miss the aspect of being able to catch up with friends and have a laugh, I miss being invited or thought of to hang out with. 

While I have supportive families both sides who we visit often, it would be nice to see a friend even if it was just for a coffee.. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for advice or if I‚Äôm just letting out some feelings so I don‚Äôt spiral and sit here telling myself negative things which would feed further into my PPD.. ",1,1759040137.0,Mommit,2,1.0,False

‚ÄúWar? Are you crazy?‚Äù Ginny said, staring at him.

‚ÄúDid you see the whole meeting?‚Äù Adam replied as he looked at a report. The damn Pirate fleet had been a thorn in his butt for so long now, and he was not interested in an argument.

‚ÄúNo. I just saw the news. We are at war with Earth.‚Äù She replied, and Adam sighed.¬†

‚ÄúLet me guess it‚Äôs on GNC? Right,‚Äù Adam replied as he glanced at the hologram, and she looked guilty.

‚ÄúMother-in-law sent me a link. They are all talking about it on the groups.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, see the whole meeting, they declared war on us because I didn‚Äôt want to give them full control of the new region. Come on Ginny. The Freedom Union has been infiltrating GNC for a long time. Kun Nar‚Äôs are behind that political faction. You might as well listen to his podcasts, what's the name again? The anti-Burimo talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but it's still war! They are afraid the fleets have to fight you.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell your mother-in-law to talk to her husband. I closed the gates to Earth. The nearest fleet under their control is four months away.¬† Let me work on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me you have a plan!‚Äù Ginny said, clearly frustrated

‚ÄúWhen do I not?‚Äù He replied. ‚ÄúNow go watch the whole thing.‚Äù

Ginny nodded, said goodbye, and he went back to his work when a cup of coffee almost magically appeared on his desk.

‚ÄúMom‚Äôs just as worried, Dad is calmer,‚Äù Evelyn said as she leaned on the desk, looking at him.

‚ÄúWell, I wish it wouldn‚Äôt go that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should send Roks through that gate on a raid, just to show force.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to be escalated. Besides, he has a job to do. He has to deal with Xanadu and it‚Äôs ilk.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not send the Marines?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I want to show Earth that our military can easily take over a colony if we want. He has five to take over on the same day.¬† Having the human fleet stand by and watch is a test of loyalty for both sides.‚Äù

Are you expecting any of them to break rank?‚Äù She asked, and Adam shook his head.

‚ÄúNo, but Earth does. We have about four months to prevent this from becoming a blood bath.¬† Sig-san and his team have already left. Sarah has been rounding up human spies and saboteurs. Sly-San has been of immense help with that.‚Äù

‚Äúgood where is the Chris? He didn‚Äôt come home from school.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn his office.‚Äù Adam winked. ‚ÄúKnock before you enter.‚Äù

She looked at him, then smirked a little. ‚ÄúWell, at least he is more discreet than Wei. I‚Äôll call him up and get him home before dinner.‚Äù

‚ÄúArchie suggested a higher security detail on them. He has already sent out extra angels.‚Äù Adam replied, and she looked at him, then at Archie sitting in the corner, logged into security feeds or what else he might be watching, and back to Adam.

‚ÄúHe is still a droid.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but the logic is sound. He even suggested biological bodyguards to avoid them being hacked.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat makes sense.‚Äù She turned to Archie. ‚ÄúGood job, I agree.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, my lady.‚Äù¬† He replied, and she smiled.

‚ÄúGod damnit, I like that. My lady. Yeah, you can call me that. Okay, don‚Äôt work too long, dinner is ready in two hours.‚Äù Then she left, and Adam looked after her, his eyes lingering on her beautiful behind. She still was the most beautiful woman he had met, and she knew it.

Then he went back to work. He had been working for an hour when a secure message came through.

\- Saw your vacation video of your new vacation home, loved it, and sent it to friends. They loved it too. ¬†A few people asked if there were still free spots, including Dad and Mum.-

He looked at the message and replied.

\- Many new homes are available there; tell your parents they are more than welcome. ¬†I will instruct the salesman to contact you regarding the various homes. ‚Äì

¬†He sent the message and looked at it. Then he contacted Arus.

‚ÄúHi there. Am I disturbing?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope, she is still going over the files Hyd-Drin provided as well as the survey teams. I‚Äôm free for at least two more weeks.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, I need you to head to the southern union and give a speech at their federation. Bring the evidence, and there is one more thing we are working on.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Southern Federation? Didn‚Äôt you close the gate?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that's why you have to take the long route, to the Nalos kingdom. You have to convince them to let you speak in the federation.¬† You can use Admiral Toberius Gi Iven ship. He will be an asset there. ¬†I need this speech delivered. If they stand down and do not get involved, then I will offer them a direct gate between their senate Hub and Dirt as well as a Gate program between their nations.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can do that. I only need to get them to stand down? What about joining you?‚Äù

Adam laughed. ‚ÄúYou do that, and¬† well, what do you want in return?‚Äù

‚ÄúChris. I want Chris to become my student. I want him to spend two years traveling the galaxy with me and some mentors and learn, and Sam to go on an apprenticeship with Monori.‚Äù

Adam looked at him. ‚ÄúI can support it, but I need Evelyn's approval. As for Sam, I think that can be arranged.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, I will contact the admiral and leave tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake care now and tell Monori to take a break, or I will personally come and drag her out of the library.‚Äù When Arus logged off, there was a knock on the door, and he looked up to see Vorts there.

‚ÄúHey! Come in, what dragged you all the way here?‚Äù

‚ÄúVorts looked a little distressed as he sat down. ‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething stronger, please.‚Äù

Adam looked at him and got up, then poured two glasses of whiskey. Then, he offered him as Vorts took out a memory crystal and plugged it in. Adam leaned on the desk.

‚ÄúSo what is this about? Why are you so spooked?‚Äù

He took the glass, sipped it, and looked at Adam seriously. ‚ÄúRemember the old Dunshin transport?‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam nodded, Yes, the one with the nasty nano-virus,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúThe Hisgian virus, or as you humans would call it, the zombie virus,‚Äù Vorts said, and Adam put down his glass, looking at him and then at the report that appeared. Something was highlighted, and he read it.

‚ÄúAre you sure about this?‚Äù ¬†He said as he sat down. ‚ÄúHave Jork seen this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes and Yes, as you can see, the shutdown code is the DNA sequence of the original host, and Kun-Nar sent out somebody with samples of the virus. There are more carens out there. ¬†We only know she was going to an area outside known federations.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way to hack it?‚Äù Adam asked as he felt shivers running down his spine.

‚ÄúOh, we can hack it, but it will take time, and you have to inject them with our own nano-vaccine. It will be able to shut down the infected, but if they are already dead, then you end up with a corpse.‚Äù

Then he changed the files, and Adam saw a group of large animals with Exoskeletons. ¬†And the pirates have been working on this. Turns out the Carens love using biological weapons. They released hordes of these on a pre-space civilization under the Hunkor region. I request a team to deal with the pest. They don‚Äôt even know they are under attack from aliens.

‚ÄúWhat technological level are we talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúEarly industry, gunpowder, early cartridge, and they have zeppelins and might discover oil and phones within the next decades. That is, if they survive.‚Äù Vorts said.

‚ÄúHow did you find out about that, and how will they react to us?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúA captured pirate vessel with one dead caren researcher onboard. As for us. Muskin would be able to hide us. They are humanoids. I think you humans would call them walking lemurs. Yeah, that‚Äôs what they told me to use‚Äîeven got a big tail, about two meters tall as well. The Hunkor named them Dynip. They have been monitoring them. They were the ones who informed us about the pirate activities. I was nearby since I‚Äôm working on their botany problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, We need to deal with that first. I will inform the federation and offer aid.‚Äù

I have already spoken with the Hunork as this falls under their jurisdiction. The king and queen were more than willing to let you intervene in the matter. They were quite welcoming once I mentioned you. Said something about you giving them the best days of their life. What did you do?‚Äù

Adam chuckled. ‚ÄúI gave them both jobs on the same trash hauler when they ran away from their arranged marriage. They met and fell in love, unaware of who the other truly was. It was quite fun to arrange. Anyway. I still have to inform the federation, but I will send some teams to deal with the problem. Anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNaw,¬† well yes.. Rohan, I know he is young, but he is quite intelligent. ‚Äú

‚ÄúHe is Four Vorts!‚Äù Adam interrupts.

‚ÄúYes, a 4-year-old who has played the biological trait games at the primary five levels. I have never seen it before.

‚ÄúSo, what are you suggesting?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúJust some simple biology lessons. Just in case he is truly blessed in the field. If so, then I would like to take him as an apprentice when he grows up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, nothing wrong with some extra education.‚Äù He replied.

‚ÄúGood, anyway, I will deal with this problem with the Dynip. ¬†And have Saig-San keep an eye out for that virus. I have had Jork add a patch to all medical scanners looking for the Hisgian virus.‚Äù Then he finished his drink, as five girls tumbled into the room giggling.

‚ÄúSarah got a boyfriend!‚Äù May said, and her little sister lunged at her.

‚ÄúTake that back.‚Äù

Vorts' oldest daughter got in the way, giggling, and faced the angry girl, and May ran out. Adam and Vorts looked at the girls as they ran out, only Sarah was left.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not true, Daddy. I only said Jonry looked cute with his blue mohawk.‚Äù She said, holding back tears

They both looked at her and smiled. ‚ÄúI agree he looks cute in it, but don‚Äôt say cute, say cool. Boys like that better.‚Äù Vorts said, and she nodded.

‚ÄúCool, I got it. Dad? Where did you hide my gun?‚Äù

Adam looked at her, then at Vorts, who grinned, and Adam opened his drawer, took out the toy shock gun, and tossed it to her.

‚ÄúFour against one, it's only fair you can defend yourself. Just be careful and don‚Äôt shoot your mum or the triplets.‚Äù¬†

She nodded, cocked the gun, and called out with the sweetest voice she could muster. ‚ÄúOh May.. guess what I got back!‚Äù

¬†Then she ran out.

¬†The two men laughed, and about ten seconds later, they heard two women shouting ‚ÄúADAM!‚Äù

\-three days later over Xanadu ‚Äì

Roks looked down on the planet; it was a heavily industrialized world. With only a few green spots left, above it hung a medium-sized space station.

He opened a channel and waited patiently for the reply. Instead of a reply, they launched an attack. He chuckled and waited for the missiles and rail guns to empty their magazines. This ship could take the impact from the rail gun, and they fired the missiles too early, so all missiles were hacked and detonated at a safe distance.

‚ÄúHave you hacked the security feed?‚Äù He looked at his security officer, who needed, and put the administrator's office up on the screen. He saw Adams' donors and a few others standing around a holographic display of the battlefield. He had all of them in his file except one.

‚ÄúThat Advisor, the Murgot. Who is he? He looks military.‚Äù

‚Äúscanning and searching now.¬† Hmm, he is logged in as Lars Kung. Military advisor and leader of the Junibu Mercenaries. And they are a front for the lost fleet. Yeah, he is on the list; we just didn‚Äôt have a facial of him. He has a stealth dreadnaught at his disposal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, scan for it, he is planning an ambush,‚Äù Jork replied, and then he smiled. ‚ÄúGunner, I want one laser shot at the center of that holographic war table. Can you do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. Let me do the calculations.‚Äù As the gunner replied, the ship rocked as something hit it.

‚ÄúWe are getting boarded, sir. ¬†By some sort of giant spiders and lizards?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh fuck, for crying out loud. Just flood the sections with cryo gas and tell the crew to get away.‚Äù Roks said and turned his head back to the gunner. ‚ÄúWhen you're ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúFiring now, sir!‚Äù He replied, and a focused, intense beam was visible for ten seconds. Roks looked at the screen as the holographic war table had a nice hole in the middle of it, and it short-circuited.

‚ÄúBoarding animals contained, Sir.‚Äù Came from behind, then another alarm went off. ‚ÄúSaboteurs on board, looks like the animals were a distraction. Enemy located and taken out. Do we counter board?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, they might have intel, send in angles and mechs, they might try to self-destruct.‚Äù

Then he turned towards the screen, ‚ÄúContact them again.‚Äù

The communication officers sent a request. He watched as they looked at the incoming call, listening to the CCTV feeds.

‚ÄúWho the hell does that dog think he is! Where are the Marines?‚Äù Maria Lee shouted.

‚ÄúThey are ignoring our calls. Admiral Hicks simply told us he doesn‚Äôt protect criminals.‚Äù And aid said.

‚Äúfuck him, I want that skinned alive, where are the men you promised us?‚Äù She continued as she turned to the Murgot captain, who seemed calm.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy men are setting the ambush as we speak, he won't know what hit him.‚Äù He replied, and Maria's husband, David, looked at the destroyed table.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like you are on top of everything. And can somebody block that damn line?¬† It's not like we are going to speak to that dog. Launch another missile attack and all our fighters, and prep the self-destruction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat will take five minutes, sir!‚Äù An aid replied.

‚ÄúGood start then, and set it for thirty minutes. It will give us time to escape this rock.‚Äù Maria replied, and her husband grinned.

‚ÄúGreat minds think alike.‚Äù

.

.

‚Äú Hack their communication lines, I‚Äôm want to speak with them.‚Äù Roks said.

‚ÄúHacking‚Ä¶.. give me a second‚Ä¶. And there. You're one!‚Äù

‚ÄúHello again, Adam is sending his regards. Now Adam is in a good mood and is willing to let you pack your stuff and leave.‚Äù

He watched as they looked around, first confused, then panicked, and finally they calmed down as if they had won.

‚ÄúYour problem is that I‚Äôm not Adam, I‚Äôm the freaking god of war.‚Äù¬† He turned to the gunner. ‚ÄúRemove that building!‚Äù

It took the gunner ten seconds to fulfill Rok's request in a satisfactory manner. Roks smirked slightly. Then turned to his CO, You have the list of people Adam wants removed. Make the arrangements.

Then he went to his communication room and called up his fleet officers to obtain their reports. The same story repeated itself; they were attacked when entering the system. A few mercenary groups were all the defense they mustered. He reviewed the report and sent it to Adam, then called him.

‚ÄúYou absolutely had to kill them?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúThey opened fire first, refused to talk, and had my ship boarded. It's war Adam. I cut the head of the snake. In matters of war, I have full command, remember. You can yell at me later over a few beers.‚Äù

Adam looked at him and smiled slightly. ‚ÄúWell, they declared war on me, and you did try to contact them first, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I started the battle as a true gentleman and let them fire first. Even tried to contact them again. They left me no choice once they were taken off the planet, it surrendered very quickly. Oh, and they had a advisor who is connected to the Lost Fleet as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, I will send some diplomats and administrators to take over the planets. Now hurry back, we've got BBQ tonight.‚Äù
