I recently moved here for a new job. I have been exploring a mix of history, economics, and machine learning. I'm excited to get to know the city, meet new people, and discover all things local—whether it's a cozy café, great food spots, or fun outdoor activities. 

I primarily enjoy reading books, interested to engage on entrepreneurship, network with local business owners.  

Would love any tips on places to check out or if anyone’s up for a coffee meet-up!

1gg64ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1gg64ax/help_please_positioning_my_hisense_c2_ultra/,Help please positioning my Hisense C2 Ultra,"I just got my C2 Ultra and I'm trying to get the best native position without using keystone.

I am new to understanding all the technical features of projectors firstly lens shift!

I know the C2 Ultra doesn't have lens shift but in the settings there is a setting where I can move the image vertically and it does it even when it's in its native throw so how does it do this if it doesn't have lens shift?

also I'm struggling to understand the fact you can pivot the projector up and down isn't that kind of the same thing as lens shift? Although I realise by doing this it will require keystone adjustment to make the image square which I want to avoid

I just found out all projectors are different in where their lens centre is. My old cheap projector off Amazon I just positioned it where the lens was centre to the screen and it cast a perfect square image without needing keystone adjustment 

But I put the Hisense in the same position and the native image casts up to the ceiling. So it seems the native position of the lens is pointing up a bit so it's designed to place the projector nearer to the ground

Looks like that's what I have to do then? My wife would actually prefer the projector be mounted on the ceiling but I thought with this projector if I do that I will need keystone but got told if I invert the projector and have it close the ceiling that should be similar to if the projector was on a stand at coffee table height because it points up having it close to the ceiling should cast a native image right about where I want it without needing keystone?

it's all very confusing to me at the moment I know it's a lifestyle projector so it's designed to be portable but it does say it can be mounted from the ceiling and even has an option in the settings to tell it that's the mount point.

At the end of the day the priority for me is to cast a native image without needing keystone so trying to work out how that will be done?

and is the point of having the projector pivot on its y axis is in case you can't get it the exact height to throw a square image so you can point the lens to get the image where you want it but then that needs keystone adjustment?

It'll be our first time. We have an airbnb in Brooklyn (Bed stuy) for 4 nights and a hotel on park avenue for the remainder.

Things we like: interesting neighborhoods, autumn, music, walking around/lounging, coffee, parks, bars, cafes, thrift/vintage shops, trendier shops.

For food, my partner is vegetarian, not picky as long as there's protein. So restaurants don't need to be fully veg as long as they have a bomb veggie dish.

I am going to throw away the rest.

There were three bunches of filter in a box. I used two bunches, and I started to consume the last bunch yesterday.

I had not rinsed the filter and it had been good. But the coffee I brewed yesterday was smell really bad, like a soap without fragrance. I never experienced that kind of smell from any coffee so I thought maybe my coffee bean was stale, because it was two month old. Also, I smelled the dry filter and it was okay. 

But it turned out that the filter was bad. I tried my v60 with hario filter today, and the coffee had no problem at all.

So I rinsed the timemore filter and smelled the water, and it was disgusting, exactly same strong soapy smell I tasted from the coffee yesterday.

I believe the LOT of the third bunch has serious issue. I hope they realized it by now. But I am not going to by their filter never again, though. 

I think I have to throw the rest and buy kalita wave filter for my B75.

How do I have a conversation with her about this? ,"We’ve been together for 2.5 years and for the past 2 years she’s financially supported me. I quit my job because I wasn’t being treated right and was being taken advantage of by my employers (I was working for my own family business, so I felt like my parents were taking advantage of me). I quit because of it. They had cushioned my bank account and I never had to worry about money but now that’s gone. I also know, when they pass, I’ll have a large inheritance as I’m one of two children. 

Over the two years, she’s mentioned how she doesn’t like our financial situation and how she’s not happy. She’s broken up with me over it twice but came back because we love each other. The last two months, she’s been so unbearable to be around because she’s so unpredictable and moody. We talked about it the other day and I thought things would turn up but she’s still so unpleasant to be around. She explained how she felt so overwhelmed with supporting me, she feels like she’s taking care of a child, and she feels like I’m not doing my part as a partner. She complained that she makes all the money, she cleans, does laundry, does the errands, does all the house and car maintenance. I told her everything is in her name so that’s her responsibility. She told me that I’m living with her for free so I could pick up the slack and try harder to get a job. I do all the cooking for her and pack all her lunches. I even get up at 5 when she works so she can have her coffee and smoothie ready to go. She complains that when she comes home from her shifts, the place is a mess and that I’m home all day long and I do nothing. I promised her I’d try harder to get a job but the household things are her job because she’s the woman. (We believe in the values where the woman takes care of the home and the man provides)…she came back at me saying I don’t provide, she does, so while he’s not providing he needs to contribute in other ways. I agreed even though I wasn’t happy about it and I reminded her I loved her and will try harder to get a job. Even since that talk, she’s irritable, quiet, silently aggressively cleans, cries, always wants to be alone. She’ll have moments where she feels back to normal where she’s friendly and loving but otherwise it just seems like she hates me. She told me she’s lost all her savings and is in debt now because of my spending habits. I keep reminding her that she will be filthy rich if she stays with me because of my inheritance. She said there is no guarantee that I will get it. 

As a background, when this started, I had no money to get me by, no savings. I started to explain to my gf my situation and told her my ex offered me money (I ran into her at the gym and spoke to her about this all) and that I’d take it but it meant I’d have to keep a friendly relationship with her. My gf didn’t like that and I basically told her, it’s your money or hers so which is it? She gave me a couple hundred dollars and then that lead to her giving me her spare credit card for emergencies and her letting me use her car. We moved in together shortly after, me promising her I’d get a job. And I was trying to. We moved to the city so I’d have better access to public transport and jobs. 2 years later, I haven’t been able to get a job. She pays all the bills, she pays for all my nights out with the guys. 

I thank her profusely every once in a while but she seems so done with me and i don’t want her to leave me. I’m well aware she could do better than me…I’ve even told her that. She told me she doesn’t want someone else, she just wants me but she needs me to do more because I’m “not providing bare minimum in this relationship” 

How do I fix this?




TLDR; my gf has been supporting me for 2 years and she’s so annoyed and moody all the time. I’m worried she’ll leave me but I’m also annoyed at her attitude. What can I do to fix this?

My former stepfather was all these things and more. When I was a child, he used to lock me in my bedroom and force me to eat a bar of soap when I “misbehaved”. I’ve never been hit so hard in my entire life by someone 5 times my size. A few times he dragged me across my bedroom floor by my hair.

[I don’t like being a mum?](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/Parenting/comments/y23r0y/comment/isp4az5/?context=3): **October 12, 2022**

I don’t even know where to start… my baby boy is exactly 1 month old and my feelings are all over the place. I feel like I love him (especially when he’s sleeping and not demanding) but also like I dont? 

What kind of a monster am I when I don’t feel so attached to my baby? I was waiting for that magical feeling everyone keeps telling me about but I still enjoy time away from him more than hanging out with him. Dont get me wrong, I DO take care of him, he’s always fed, I change his diapers, I cuddle him, rock him, talk to him, sing to him, kiss him… but I HATE doing it. 

I dont think it can be PPD/PPA since Im on antidepressants for 2 years now so PPD/PPA is prevented. I know I will get a lot of hate and honestly I feel like I would deserve it. This baby was planned and wished for so I have no right to feel so disconnected from him. I have no right to enjoy being away from him. 

People keep telling me it will get better when he will sleep longer but he lets me sleep for 3 - 5 hours at night (sure he wakes up for paci or so) so sleep is not an issue. I feel like a horrible mom and a person generally. 

Im writing this while crying hysterically while cuddling his little innocent cute head feeling enormous guilt that he deserves better…

**Commenter 1:** Oh honey, that's completely normal. I didn't particularly enjoy the first year with my kid! She's four now, and even though days can be rough, things are way better now.

But until then, it seems to me that you are a bit burnt out? Do you get breaks from caring for your baby? And I don't mean ""hop under the shower for 5 mins"", I mean ""went to Starbucks for an hour and had my favourite beverage"". Is the father in the picture? Or do you have someone to take over for a bit? You cannot pour from an empty cup, and your cup seems to be quite empty. You can and should enjoy being away from him. That shit us hard, and you need a break!

I am not made to be a fulltime Mom, I need my time away to fill my self care tank and to be able to take care of her. This is important for me.

Again, completely normal feelings. Try to get a regular breather. And as dumb as it sounds: it will get better.

> **OOP:** Thank you! Yes father is in the picture and helps a little but usually when the baby is asleep lol. Like he watches over him while i take a shower but doesnt change his diapers or feed him. But to be honest I feel a lot better now, maybe it was my hormones or heavy bleeding that was making me so nervous. Also my little sis (12yo) came a took some of the feedings (I didnt force her to, she wanted to take care and cuddle her nephew) so I got to take a rest from the mummy duties even though I was right next to her when she fed him. I also did some gardening while baby was asleep in his stroller, took a walk alone for 30 min.

According to my mom group, I’m terrible mom to my 11 month old because…

I’m taking him to play in children designated areas (IDK how to say it in english) - where I can drink a cup of coffee - because there are germs … said to me by mom who doesnt let her baby be on the grass because then she would have to wash his clothes.

I’m giving my baby fruit yoghurts instead of plain white ones (which we both hate) … said to my by mom who said she is spanking her 9MO and want to continue to do so bc he needs to know his manners.

I’m gonna do 2 days of nursery and go to work half-time when he turns 1 YO … said to me by mom who screams at her baby “shut up you stupid bi*ch”.

Im not perfect. A lot of the time Im not sure if Im making good decisions for my baby. A lot of time I worry if Im not hurting him by the choices I make. Hes my world and I would die if anything happened to him, but I also want a sense of “normalcy” so that maybe makes me a bad mom?… 

Today I was thinking that maybe, just maybe, Im not the problem in my mom group? Maybe my PPA is a lot worse thanks to people I hang out with? At this point i seriously dont know. One of them said to my that I shouldnt have a baby when I know I struggle with anxiety and that it was selfish of me to have him..

> **OOP:** Cultural component is also at play. We have 3 years of maternity leave (but with horrible money) so when you decide to go to work earlier you are horrible. Im glad we have this opoortunity, I really do and I know some moms would be overely happy to have this much time provided by government with your baby… its just not for me. Thats why I am taking part time. And with the hitting… well, we and other 2 countries are the only ones in EU who doesnt have in their law that hitting a child is against law so take what you want from that. But it seems like we will have it soon and that means that 1/3 of citizens will go to jail bc they are systematically hitting ther kids (young and older ones)

**Commenter 1:** Why would you voluntarily engage with these people? They sound horrible. I know the pain of potentially cutting people off when you have trouble making friends, but this behavior going to transfer to their children and then to yours if you continue. At this point you and your child are better off just being alone than interacting with them. Find some new friends

> **OOP:** Idk they are the only other moms I got and it felt good at first not being completely alone. But yeah now Im starting to see things from different perspective. I just wanted to make sure Im not the one with a problematic attitude and needs to change you know, I wouldnt want to cut people off when I would be the problem. As my ego is now crashed its hard for me to believe in myself

[Hating being a mom 1 year update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/s/nVDa8UFjvH): **September 12, 2023 (one month later)**

My baby is turning 1 year today. Ive got a lot of thinking about the last year. I suffer PPD/PPA/POCD so that may be affecting my thinking but when my boy was born I didnt want to be his mom. He was prayed for, planned and loved from the positive pregnancy test. 

Pregnancy and labor went ok, just some minor inconvenience. But when he was born I didnt love him. I made sure to hold him even in the hospital as much as possible but it all felt like a chore. I couldnt find any joy in what i was doing. I was happy he is in this world but i would pray somebody was there to collect him and I would just visit as a funny aunt from time to time. Pospartum was hell. I was bleeding heavily for 3 months on top of my c scar healing.

I expected some shift in my personality and becoming “mom figure” but I was still the same (tbh I still dont feel like Im an archetypical mom). Im still the same. I still have my dreams, wishes, opinions. I still cling to my freedom when I am able to have some.

But 1 year has passed. And I love him so much it hurts. I have separation anxiety when not with him. I laugh everyday bc of something hes done. I love being his mom (but still dread motherhood duties lol).

1 year ago I had anxiety 24/7. And i dont mean just typical worry, I mean the real anxiety, derealization and all the funny stuff. Violent intrusive unwanted thoughts. Just looking at my baby sent me down the spiral od panic attacks.

Now Im mostly okay and if the anxiety creeps in, its not as often nor not as severe. Just the typical “worry”.

I came to the conclusion I just hate the baby stage. And its ok. Im still on high dose of antidepressants but finally I can see the light. And I cant wait for the next stage bc maybe I will enjoy toddlerhood even more. Im full of hope (1 year ago I was full of darkness).

So maybe this post will give somebody the hope the need. Its ok to hate baby stage. You are not weird or evil. It doesnt mean you shouldnt become a mother. It gets better. I know it sounds silly but at the time i was clinging on those words.

Oh and also happy birthday my beautiful sweet angel boy. Mama loves you

**Deleted Commenter:** My mom had severe PPD after I was born. It was so bad, I understand , that she tried to kill herself by taking pills. My sister, who was only four, found her barely breathing and screamed so hard the neighbors came into our house and saved my mom. That memory has stayed with my sister to this day and has had a profound effect on her.

I don't blame my mom. PPD is brutal but doctors then didn't recognize it and didn't treat it. My mom tried to get help. It wasn't available then. It is now. If anyone reading this has PPD, get help -- today. Not doing so can harm not just your baby but also you.

> **OOP:** Postpartum mental health issues are real and yes, seek help dont wait untill it goes away on its own. I just wanted to put some peace of mind for other moms suffering. Its deffinetely amazing with my son right now. Its so fun to see his wheeles in his head start to function lol. I love taking him places and showing him the world. I think my PPD was mostly bc I felt like I HAVE TO love it. And I didnt. So its ok not to love it. Your time will come

**OOP on dreading some of the parenthood stages**

> **OOP:** Yes. Everone dread some stage of parenthood. Someone hates toddler stage, someone hates teens… for me it was baby stage. But in our society you HAVE to love the baby stage though its totally acceptable to hate teens. This was always wild to me. You are allowed to hate just what society hates. And if you hate any other stage, you are weird bad mom. I just wanted to make sure some mommy out there may be wondering if its ok to not love this and I am shouting YES IT IS. Does toddlers have their own challenges? Yes. But for me its mostly annoying, not “I hate this with all my guts” anymore. And I can totally see why someone hates toddlers/preschool/school/preteen/teen…

[Hate being a mom 2 years update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/s/dCfiQPOU26): **October 23, 2024 (13 months later)**

I wrote similar post 1 year ago. I am writing it mainly for the moms desperately searching google as I did 2 years ago.

Its honestly… amazing now. The screaming potato now talks. He picks up new word every day. He is incredibly funny (he would do some mischief and look me in the eyes and say “bye bye mamma” as he thinks im gonna leave and not notice it lol). We get a full night of sleep. And as we wake up, I put on a cartoon, make breakfast and we watch Maya The Bee while I drink my coffee in peace. We can walk short distances without a stroller (i hate this contraption lol). 

When we go shopping I give him things to put in the cart and seeing lis little body wiggle and his little hands trying to reach the cart is the cutest. He cuddles the hell out of everything and everyone (our dogs are the main victims lol but they dont seem to mind). He amazes me how smart he is. He can count to 10 (im certain its just remembered from me counting steps but it doesnt hurt to brag) and know his colours. He is curious and playful and angry and happy and joyful and annoying and I love evrything about him.

Life is good.

Dont ever lose hope, because your time will come.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on the child’s current toddler phases**

> **OOP:** Im trying to get as much cuddles as one can have. We cosleep now and sometimes he will wake in the middle of the night, announce “mama cuddle” and lay his head on my shoulder and be a little spoon and fall asleep immedietely and I will wake up with my back sore and I dont mind it at all. I know this wont last forever.

**Commenter:** That sounds awesome. When they start to develop their own quirky personality it gets so much fun. Especially when they want to help you

1gg5rml,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelyouwithTravelC/comments/1gg5rml/apartment_decorating_ideas_make_your_first_rental/,Apartment Decorating Ideas - Make Your First Rental Look and Feel Like Home,"

Moving into your first rental apartment is an exciting milestone, but it can also feel a bit daunting. The blank walls and unfamiliar spaces can seem impersonal at first. However, with the right decorating ideas, you can transform your apartment into a cosy, stylish haven that truly feels like home. Here’s how to do it.

**1. Start with a Color Palette**

https://preview.redd.it/zh39q2w9k0yd1.jpg?width=1060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e38b8f4524b1df10df219283154056c2ddef5afe

img via[ freepik](https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/3d-rendering-loft-scandinavian-living-room-with-working-table-bookshelf_105762-2141.jpg?t=st=1724636156~exp=1724639756~hmac=a29f204ad65958fa24e43c1e10fa41d4261331c7c2f4b556370c1e480af3dc0a&w=1060)  


Choosing a cohesive colour palette is the first step to making your space feel intentional and put together. Stick to a few complementary colours for a harmonious look. If you can’t paint the walls, focus on textiles and accessories—think rugs, curtains, and throw pillows—in your chosen colours. Neutrals with pops of colour are always a safe bet for creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.

**2. Incorporate Personal Touches**  
Nothing makes an apartment feel more like home than adding personal touches. Display photos of family and friends, showcase souvenirs from your travels or hang art that resonates with you. These personal elements will not only make your space more inviting but also help you feel connected to your environment.

**3. Invest in Multi-Functional Furniture**

https://preview.redd.it/1ewldsmhk0yd1.jpg?width=1060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95f0b5cbdc81a19bc41a0566ffe97ae827928187

In a rental, especially if it’s a smaller space, every piece of furniture should serve multiple purposes. Consider a sofa bed for guests, a coffee table with storage, or an ottoman that can double as extra seating. These pieces not only maximize your space but also contribute to a more organized and clutter-free environment. Most modern[ apartment projects in Sri Lanka](https://bit.ly/3Sn4pho) offer sleek, timeless furniture to improve the overall quality and experience.

**4. Layer with Textures**  
Textures play a crucial role in making a space feel cosy and lived-in. Layer your space with different fabrics and materials, such as a soft throw blanket over a leather couch, a jute rug under a wooden coffee table, or velvet pillows on a bed. Mixing textures adds depth and warmth to your apartment, making it feel more inviting.

**5. Lighting is Key**  
Good lighting can completely transform the ambience of your apartment. Instead of relying solely on overhead lights, incorporate various light sources like floor lamps, table lamps, and string lights. Opt for warm, soft lighting to create a cosy atmosphere, and use mirrors strategically to reflect light and make your space feel larger and brighter.",1,1730346566.0,TravelyouwithTravelC,0,1.0,False

1gg5ra8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gg5ra8/aio_my_friends_constantly_leave_me_out_of_plans/,AIO My friends constantly leave me out of plans and don't invite me to things,We have a group chat of just us three and I'm never invited out to anything. They'll make plans right in front of me in the group chat and not invite me. For this post we'll call them beth and kayla. Yet every single time I want to make plans everyone's busy or just CAN'T. Here's a few examples. I said something about wanting to see Beth. And she says well my car's tire isn't airing up properly or I'd come by. I accept this no problem. I find out later that week they are together texting the groupchat every step of their routine getting ready to go out. She makes such an effort to see Kayla that her tire goes completely flat she managed to pull over and put a donut on to keep the festivities with them going. All the while they are sending me pictures and videos. Beth will go pick up Kayla so Kayla never has to use her own car. Beth has come to get me twice when it came to going out once with Kayla and once without. But I feel like the only reason we hung out that time was BECAUSE Kayla wasn't available. There was another time where Beth comes to the group chat to ask me if she can come over my house because she's so overstimulated she can't take it she just needs to be OUT. I invite her over but soon realize that was the ONLY time she had ever asked me to hang out bc she was in dire need to get out of the house and Kayla wasn't available. Another day this week exactly. I say I want some good iced coffee I was going to try to convince my husband to go get me one but I didn't know yet. Kayla exclaims YEAH I want that so bad that sounds so good! And they literally make plans to go out and get the same thing I wanted and had the idea in the first place for without me. And no less than 1 hour or two they link up and are out and about. They also JUST planned to go to another event without me where Beth is bringing her child. And says he'll really enjoy this this is gonna be so fun for him! Knowing I also have a child who could possibly enjoy the event while Kayla has none. It just makes me feel very bad when they do things like prioritize each other and they never make time for me. I've gotten the advice of just ASK to join. But they never HAVE to ask each other to be included. They make plans with each other in mind actively. Plans happen in the spur of the moment and if one can they'll drop everything to make sure the other is included. Also why make plans IN the group chat knowing I'm not invited or a part of those in the first place. I have other friends so that's not why it bothers me it's just the lack of consideration or effort to see me on their end makes it feel like we aren't really friends. And when I ask to do something it seems like they are Way less enthusiastic to be there or be talking about it. Or Beth complains about some aspect of leaving the house or going out that makes it not exciting anymore for ME. Or she'll take 2 hours to finally show up to get me so we can begin our plans.

I am a chronically ill person who is now going through and potentially getting diagnosed with cfs. 

I have POTS, scleroderma, pbc, and my autoimmune specialists are saying my fatigue is too severe for those diagnosis I have and it could be cfs as well, so I am getting referred out. 

My gastroenterologist today said to me… you’re 36, you shouldn’t be walking with a walker. Very depressing, but I digress.  He wants me to do “intensive physio therapy” because I have been falling recently and am really unstable on my legs. He is also the one who said it’s probably cfs. 

Looking at the diagnosing criteria, it’s all one giant check mark including pem. If I over do it I can’t leave bed except to pee for a week minimum. In bad moments, I’ve been known to not touch my phone for over 48hours. I’ve been off work since March, and I feel like I am rapidly declining. Right now, I am only leaving bed to pee, and make my morning coffee. My wife sets me up with bottles of water and snacks before she goes to work. 

I guess, I don’t know what I’m looking for here. I suppose maybe some advice? What I’ve read about cfs is that maybe physio isn’t such a good idea? Is living in bed going to make my muscles atrophy?

I’m coming here in search of some advices 

So my girlfriend gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. In the beginning everything was just fine and we were really happy. Then I started to notice some changes in her behaviour and attitude. 
She had to go back to work 2 months after giving birth cause she only got 2 months maternity leave. 
She hate that place and the people where she works at. She would always complain and be miserable about going there when she comes back home. I advised her to maybe ask her doctor for some medication to help with the stress and anxiety because it’s well known that women experience hormones changes after a pregnancy and it affects them a lot. So I was already aware of that.
She did that and got a two months supply antidepressants. When she was taking them everything was fine. Then that one day she was really bad she didn’t talk a whole 2 day despite all my efforts to make her laugh or talk. She kept saying I’m just tired then at dinner timer I was like okey that’s it what is the matter and she went on about everything I’m doing wrong when all I do is trying to make life easier for her and being supportive . It was really bad and she was being very rude. Then the next day I find out she stopped taking her medicine, and I thought to myself okay that’s it the prescription is done. But no, it happens that she decided to stop by herself because ""she hate medicine and don’t want to feel like she need to be on medicine to be normal"" my girlfriend has a history of psychiatric hospital and she went in rehab. But when building her case at the beginning of the pregnancy the doctor asked about any history regarding that she said all was good she had no history. So this whole situation got me wondering if she had would the doctor had advised or prescribed something else. 

So it’s been 3 weeks since she stopped taking her medicine almost a month. And she has only gotten worse. I can see she tries but deep down I know she just can’t. Here are some of the things she does. 
(For the record she had a son before me he’s 4 now). 
So she yells at him so bad when he don’t listen or is being too much. 
If I don’t engage we’ll spend whole day without talking to each other.
She slams doors most of the time, slam the door of the bedroom when she knows it’ll irritate me because I’m right there. 
Our newborn got into a routine of sleeping through the night now she’s disrupting that pattern in which the baby got by herself because (she feels she ain’t eating enough). Normally when she’d fuss a bit at night and im talking small fuss not even a big deal we’d just shake her a bit and or try giving her the dummy our baby was a really good sleeper. Until now. When she hears the slightest noise for the baby she wake up annoyed to go and get a bottle ready. Then come in the bedroom pick her up all annoyed and feed her then throw the bottle in a rude way on the bed. Right next to me. 
Last time I was watching late in the lounge because during the day I barely get time for myself and that’s actually one of the first times in months I decided to watch late. We always go to bed together. 
Baby woke up she came out of the room really rough in all her actions, slammed the fridge, slammed the babybottle in the bottle warmer. Water splashed everywhere. The next morning act like nothing happened at night. She yells at the baby most days and most nights. I get that it’s a lot. But I spend whole day 7/24 with the kids because I work from home but I never ever shout at our newborn or even the 4 years old. 
Every time something happens she acts like nothing happened.
Other thing is I cant have a bad day. When I show signs of being tired of just annoyed because the baby was a bit too much (which I do by just sitting and having my coffee quietly trying to regain my energy and thoughts) then she starts being annoyed because I’m (sitting there looking miserable she wishes she could wake up from a baby crying but she has to wake up because she goes to work and deal with strangers) 
First of all in the state she is at the moment if she had to be home alone with the kids every day like I do she’d have lost her shit long time ago. 
But despite going through a lot by myself I’m still supporting her emotionally and caring for her and always check on her and giving her attention. 
She hasn’t been the same since she stopped taking her medicine and she walks in the house as if I’m not here .If I don’t engage or talk to her she won’t do it. 
She loses her shit every single day. And night (after she disrupted the baby’s sleep) because now the baby is wide awake mid night because she got her used to feeding her like in the beginning although the had outgrown it. (Something she now loses her shit about although she is the one that made that happen)
She never says sorry unless we have an argument and I show signs of being supportive and understanding. So basically everything has to come from me first, she never makes the first step. Whether she right or not. She’s very prideful and has the biggest ego ever. It’s been three weeks of me trying to stay calm and ignore all this and being supportive but she act like she’s the only one going through a lot when I’m the one that spends whole day with the kids. She forget that she actually get to go out and talk with people that have common sense and can actually understand you where me I. The other hands everyday I’m dealing with a 4 year old kid. And a newborn. 
Then she comes home and act all miserable. I cook better than her so food is ready or I’m making dinner toddler is bathed. 

Only thing she has to do after work is shower, bath and feed the baby. (She always complains about there’s a million things to do when she gets home) that, that is the million things she’s talking about. At the same time she does those 3 things. I am: bathing the toddler, cooking dinner, feeding the dogs, washing the dishes, feeding the toddler, setting the table and dishing up for us, cleaning the mess I made in the kitchen, putting the toddler to bed. Yet she complains all she do she can do it sitting down. I’m all around the house working yet she never acknowledges anything everything is always about her. 

So I’m thinking of talking to her dad, even though I know she’s big on denying things and making herself sound like a victim. Or I’m thinking of leaving the house for a while because I feel like it’s when you lose something that you realise their value. And I do not feel appreciated enough or respected despite all my efforts and everything she does that I’m letting slide. She will never come and tell me how she’s sorry about yesterday or her behaviour and is appreciative. On the contrary is I tell her what’s wrong why you acting like that she goes quiet and make herself seem like a victim. (She keeps pouring from an empty cup is her favourite saying nowadays) which is rude because what about me being there for you everyday even when you’re rude and being extreme.

I’m Abedin Sayef, the guy behind [Band-Logos.Com](http://Band-Logos.Com), where we make logos for rock and metal bands. But the story of how it all started? Well, it’s a wild one. Buckle up, folks.

So, picture this: it’s 2 AM, I’m deep into my 5th cup of coffee, blasting Metallica’s *Master of Puppets* on repeat, and I’m frantically scrolling through “logo makers” online. Why? Because my own metal band desperately needed a logo, and every design I’d seen so far looked… well, like something you’d slap on a cleaning product, not a heavy metal band. I’m talking clean, rounded fonts, pastel colors – logos that screamed, “We mean business!” rather than “We’ll melt your face off with our guitar riffs.”

At one point, I tried a logo generator that promised “edgy” designs for “musicians.” Five minutes in, it gave me a logo that looked suspiciously like a shampoo bottle brand. 😐 Not exactly what I had in mind for a logo that was supposed to capture our band’s *brutal intensity.*

So, being the sleep-deprived, overly-caffeinated, slightly desperate guy that I was, I thought, *Screw it. I’ll just make my own logo.*

One thing led to another, and I ended up sketching a logo that actually looked decent – y'know, something a metalhead would actually want on a t-shirt. My band loved it, and before I knew it, word got out. I started getting messages from other bands like, “Hey, dude, can you make us a logo too?”

And that’s when it hit me. Why were bands settling for logos that looked like they belonged to a law firm? Rock and metal bands deserve logos that *actually look like rock and metal logos!* And in that caffeine-fueled haze, the concept for [Band-Logos.Com](http://Band-Logos.Com) was born.

Now, we help bands of all genres – from punk to black metal – brand themselves with logos that scream, “We’re here to melt your faces off,” not “Our corporate synergy is unmatched.” 🤘

It’s been a wild ride, but here we are, turning the most badass ideas into logos that bands and fans love. And if you’re in a band that’s tired of looking like an accounting firm, you know where to find me.

Cheers to logos that make your ears ring just by looking at them! 🤘",0,1730345569.0,drummers,2,0.5,False

I am traveling to Colorado this Saturday (11/2) and appreciate any feedback you may have about the itinerary I've drafted so far. I will be in Estes Park 11/3 afternoon to 11/7 morning, but I welcome suggestions on other parts of my trip as well. 

I recognize things may need to be shifted around due to weather. I am also trying to schedule around a few work calls that my friends have (or consider doing solo hikes without them). 

I greatly appreciate any feedback/suggestions. Thank you!

1gg5e9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SanderSo47/comments/1gg5e9g/weir/,Weir,"Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Peter Weir's turn.

Weir attended The Scots College and Vaucluse Boys High School before studying arts and law at the University of Sydney. His interest in film was sparked by him meeting fellow students, including Phillip Noyce and the future members of the Sydney filmmaking collective Ubu Films. After leaving university in the mid-1960s, he joined Sydney television station ATN-7, where he worked as a production assistant on the groundbreaking satirical comedy program *The Mavis Bramston Show*. During this period, using station facilities, Weir made his first two experimental short films. He would then get a job at Commonwealth Film Unit, directing short documentaries. He would leave the CFU to finally direct films.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**The Cars That Ate Paris (1974)**

*""148 people live in the township of Paris and every one of them is a murderer.""*

His directorial debut. It stars John Meillon, Terry Camilleri, and Kevin Miles. The film is set in the fictional town of Paris in which most of the inhabitants appear to be directly, or indirectly, involved in profiting from the results of car accidents.

There are no box office numbers available. The movie struggled to find an audience in Australia, changing distributors and using ad campaigns that pitched it alternately as a horror film and an art film. However it has become a cult film. By 1980, $112,500 had been returned to the producers. It also received positive reviews, with one of its fans being Stanley Kubrick. Weir was just getting started.

#**Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)**

*""On St. Valentine's Day in 1900, a party of schoolgirls set out to picnic at Hanging Rock... some were never to return.""*

His second film. Based on the novel by Joan Lindsay, the film stars Rachel Roberts, Dominic Guard, Helen Morse, Vivean Gray and Jacki Weaver. The plot involves the disappearance of several schoolgirls and their teacher during a picnic at Hanging Rock, Victoria on Valentine's Day in 1900, and the subsequent effect on the local community.

The novel was published in 1967. Reading it four years later, Patricia Lovell thought it would make a great film. She did not originally think of producing it herself until Phillip Adams suggested she try it; she optioned the film rights in 1973, paying $100 for three months. She hired Weir to direct on the basis of his short film *Homesdale*, and Weir brought in Hal and Jim McElroy to help produce. Screenwriter David Williamson originally was chosen to adapt the film, but was unavailable and recommended noted TV writer Cliff Green. Joan Lindsay had approval over who did the adaptation and she gave it to Green, whose first draft Lovell says was ""excellent"".

Weir recalled that when the film was first screened in the United States, American audiences were disturbed by the fact that the mystery remained unsolved. According to Weir, ""One distributor threw his coffee cup at the screen at the end of it, because he'd wasted two hours of his life — a mystery without a goddamn solution!""

The film was a box office hit, earning $5.12 million in Australia (or $3.36 million in US dollars). It received critical acclaim, and it has been named as one of the greatest Australian films ever made.

- **Budget:** $443,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $49,582. ($95,909 adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $3,414,057.

#**FILMS (FROM HIGHEST GROSSING TO LEAST GROSSING)**

No. | Movie | Year | Studio | Domestic Total | Overseas Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|:--------:|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
x | *Picnic at Hanging Rock* | 1975 | B.E.F. Film | $49,582 | $3,364,449 | $3,414,057 | $443K

#**The Verdict**

Hope you liked this edition. You can find this and more in the [wiki for this section.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/directors-at-the-box-office)

The next director will be **Michael Cimino**. There's making a flop, and then there's making a flop so huge you destroy a whole damn studio and era.

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... >!Taika Waititi.!< Is it truly Joever? 

This is the schedule for the following four:

Week | Director | Reasoning
:-------:|:--------:|----------
November 4-10 | Michael Cimino | It's time for *Heaven's Gate*, the worst blank check ever.
November 11-17 | Sam Mendes | How cool is it to win an Oscar on your first film?
November 18-24 | Guy Ritchie | Justice for *King Arthur*.
November 25-December 1 | Taika Waititi | Can he bounce back?

Who should be next after Waititi? That's up to you. And there's a theme.

We already covered this with the Coens, but I'm bringing it back. And that theme is... **directing duos.** A team of two or more who directed films. You know, the Wachowskis, the Farrellys, the Safdies, etc. They can direct films separately, but they still have to be known for being a duo. So who is it gonna be?",1,1730345338.0,u_SanderSo47,0,1.0,False

1gg5ba9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1gg5ba9/other_drugs_for_vtm/,Other Drugs for VTM,"    Hi, i was recently watching NY by Night and saw one of the characters (the gangrel) was playing the ""High Functioning Addict"" merit with cigarettes. This made me wander, what kind of substance do stay in the blood, and as blood is flavored by emotions i extended ""alcohol and drugs"" as psychoactives in general. Meaning cigarettes, anxiolytics, energy drinks, coffee and maeby tea's as well.
   What would it be the effects this broader drugs give a vampire. Inspired by corebook i though this as an example.
   Energy Drinks: +1 to physical rolls -1 to rolls that avoid frenzy (both fury and terror)
  •The vampire feels stressed after the effects ends for 1 scene
   Anxiolytics: +2 to rolls that avoid frenzy -2 to resist day sleep

My arms look like I had a battle with barbed wire. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I’ll try to detail what we’ve been doing.  I’m at a loss right now.

- pup is 16 weeks old, we got him from breeder at 8 weeks
- I (52/f) bonded with him first, have had multiple dogs (4) in my life.  He’s been the hardest.  My husband (never had a pet) was happy to get a puppy, and was initially reserved.  He’s since been an amazing dog dad, playing, cuddling, walking, feeding, and intervening when the pup starts his witching hour biting that is only directed at me.

Each morning pup lets us know that he wants out of his crate. He sleeps thru the night in the crate, is potty trained.  After morning pee and poop, he gets breakfast in a puzzle dish with compartments with hidden levers, to stimulate him. 

Hubby and I let him have free reign of the apt most of the time. We have baby gates in areas like kitchen to prevent him going in.  

As soon as I’m done with my shower, is when the chaos starts. I can’t walk from the bathroom to the bedroom without ankle and shower robe nipping. Once I’m dressed I can’t sit and have coffee because he’s nipping on my clothes, shoes, skin (arms).  He does not do any of this to my husband. 

He knows sit, down, off, we reward him with treats when he does the right thing, gets enforced naps, has walks outside during the week, goes everywhere with us on the weekends. 

What am I doing wrong and how can I stop the razor blade teeth biting. ",2,1730344883.0,puppy101,2,1.0,False
1gg591w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gg591w/how_do_you_know_if_you_should_actually_try_being/,How do you know if you should actually try being friends with people or not? ,"I'm (18F) having a problem making friends and I don't know if I'm the problem or I need to try to make friends with different people. 
I'm currently still in high school and I want to try to grow my friend group before I leave for college. The problem is I've never been very good at making friends and keeping them. I think mostly it's because I'm neurodivergent and struggle talking to groups of people. I've had one friend since sophomore year Sherry (names changed of course). We became good friends because we're in the same program, and end up taking a lot of the same classes as each other. 

Before I got my license when I would get dropped off in the morning I would often hang out with Sherry and their friends. We also shared the same lunch period so I would eat lunch with Sherry and her friends. Because of this I thought I was slowly joining the friend group. The problem is I never got invited when all the rest of the friend group would hang out. At first I chalked it up to that they just didn't know me well enough, and I thought of them as closer friends than they thought of me. 

Eventually I got invited to one of the person's in the friend group birthday party. I met some new people and even thought I didn't do bad in the group setting. I thought because of this party I got closer to some of the people in the group. Still even after this I wasn't getting invited to events. 

Eventually during second semester of sophomore year, I stopped sitting in the school in the mornings. I like to sit in my car in the parking lot to relax and get mentally prepared for school. Since talking to people that early in the morning was pretty draining. I thought still seeing the people in the friend group during lunch and sometimes during class was enough and we would still build closer friendships. I sadly was mistaken. 

Me and Sherry are very close now but I'm not nearly as close to everyone else in the friend group. I try to start to go inside during the mornings more so I can talk to them more but I just started feeling pushed aside during group conversations because no one was as close to me as they were everyone else. Eventually I stopped going in again. 

I had an art class with one of Sherry's other close friend because of this we started talking more and I think we became better friends. One day they asked if I was going to Sherry's surprise birthday get together at this popular coffee shop in my town. I was confused because I hadn't heard anything about it. Then I realized I wasn't invited. Everyone in the friend group knew I was one of Sherry's very close friends yet no one thought to invite me. The craziest thing was I worked at the coffee shop as a barista. If I had been told in advance about it I would've asked for the day off to join everyone else. But since I wasn't I ended up working the day everyone got together for Sherry's birthday. So I had to work as I listened to everyone else enjoy themselves and have fun all without me, because they didn't invite me when they all knew I worked there. This really hurt me. I was a bit insecure about not being invited to things before but this hurt the most. It made me really start to notice everyone's Instagram posts about their get togethers and how I was never included. And it's not like they invited me to things and I kept saying no so they stopped inviting me. Whenever I was invited to something I would always ask off of work so I could attend. 

Eventually I started doubting if anyone in the friend group other than Sherry saw me as a friend. Sure they were all friendly when I did
see them but still they never actually seemed to want me there. So now I'm in my senior year and I'm conflicted. I really just want to know if I should maybe put more effort into going inside in the mornings to talk or if it's a lost cause. I don't want to say they don't put in any effort to be friend me if I didn't put in any effort back. So did I put in enough effort before or should I try again and see if maybe I get invited to things now. I'm just really worried about the same thing happening again because I'm so bad at talking in groups. I'm already worried no one likes me so it makes it harder to feel welcomed and talk to everyone. Should I keep trying or is it a lost cause and just accept I'll only have made one close friend in all four years of high school. ",1,1730344844.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

She and I hit it off immediately. She goes to my school. Im a double (english + education) major with a minor in theater, and shes a theater tech major. So we have a lot of mutuals from being in the theater department and have even been in the same tech room at the same time for projects before.

I have a ton of midterms rn bc of my workload, and shes been super busy backstage for the school musical. So we've been texting for around 3 weeks, but haven't had a chance to meet in person. We're planning on a coffee date next week, but it hasn't been possible just yet. Which means our first time meeting in person will be at the musical this weekend. I have to go for class, and shell be backstage.

Its typical to get flowers for the person you're seeing in a show. And while I'm not going JUST for her, its something I'm really looking forward to. Rn we're just a talking stage, nothing official. But we've both made it clear that we're looking for something serious (with each other or not). So I'm trying to find a balance between doing too little and too much for our first time meeting, and I've been thinking about getting her flowers.

1gg53l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gg53l4/gym_situation/,Gym situation,"A woman at the gym that I am attracted to had been giving subtle signals to me. There had been small signs for a year but recently things picked up.She was always near me and I had seen her smiling at me, I played it cool and didn't approach her. Tension had been building and one day we both locked eyes and held it for around 20 seconds from across the room. Time stood still and it was an unbelievable experience where everything disappeared and all I could see was the pupils of her eyes.   

However after this moment I was unsure how she had taken the situation as it was so intense and I was worried that I had creeped her out as we both continued our workout after it.

I didnt see her for 3 weeks until she arrived and  went straight next to me to work out.  So I approached her and we had a great chat. I asked if we where going to go for a coffee, she said yes and asked for my number. I however asked her to put her number in my phone.

I said I would message her once home . When I got back I couldnt find her number in my phone. In fact I had picked her name up wrongly and was searching for the wrong one and never did find it to text her.

I never seen her in the gym for 3 weeks . When she returned she walked in seen me and walked back out to the changing rooms.

While leaving 15 minutes later I bumped into her at the exit. I explained the situation and asked for her number again . She was very cold with me but she put it in my phone and while doing so seen it was already saved there. I told her I must have picked her name up incorrectly. We left it at that and said our goodbyes. 

I text that evening saying that I would like to take her out and that if she wanted to go then let me know when she would be free. No reply back from her. That was friday.

On Tuesday she was back to the gym which was shockingly busy. She was looking up and down for a space  somewhat near to where I was working (squat racks) . We both made brief but discreet eye contact from a distance.

However she could not locate a space and she then turned around and left the gym.

I have heard that she did have a boyfriend  but not sure if so now. I dont know if she felt hurt I didnt text her weeks ago, I dont know if she has lost interest or is just taking a step back. she is not in the gym to often. How should I play things when I see her next? Im worried that time may pass and with that she losses interest.

What are your thoughts on the situation and my best course of action?

When she was last in the gym Iam sure that she was in to see me and possibly get me to approach her but the space was to busy. I think this because she had new clothes on, her hair done and was acting in a way that would obviously get my attention, added to that she then went out of her way to give me a noticeable but subtle look.

1gg530a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Revelstoke/comments/1gg530a/creepy_encounters_travelling_the_rogers_pass/,Creepy Encounters travelling the Roger’s pass,"OK… This is not specific to Revelstoke. However, I want to post it here to see if anybody has experienced anything remotely similar to this in the Rogers Pass between Revelstoke and Golden. 

My partner and I were driving back to Kelowna from Edmonton late last night, and both of us had this overwhelming feeling that things were very, very wrong. We had both noticed that things just seemed “off” and incredibly eerie. It felt like we weren’t supposed to be where we were. 
As we were driving along the highway quite some time before we hit Golden we encountered a rather odd situation where we were driving along the highway, and all of a sudden found ourselves doing highway speeds into a truck scale off the left hand side of the road. We were both well rested and in good mental condition, and cannot figure out for the life of us how the highway that we were driving straight on, let us directly into the unmarked scales.  After that experience, things seemed mostly normal for the most part but we were feeling like we needed to be on high alert. He and I had talked about how weird that was, and established that we were both sharing this weird overwhelming, feeling of impending doom.

Shortly afterwards we started noticing that it seemed almost every semi truck that we encountered in the oncoming lane was flashing highbeams at us, for no reason and seemed to be veering dangerously close towards us. We both found this a little bit odd however we chucked it up to tired truck drivers and kept going. Not long after this started we noticed a truck that we had passed a while back was caught up behind us and was furiously flashing highbeams at us, almost as if to alert us that something was wrong with our vehicle. It was at that point that we decided to pull over and double check that the load we had in our truck was strapped down securely, and nothing had flown out. Everything was completely fine. 
Fast forward through about a dozen more unnecessary high beams from trucks…. 

We came throughout the first set of tunnels right around 2:30 am. We were driving behind a large semi truck who allowed us to pass safely and respectfully before we hit the second set of tunnels.  He maintained a safe distance behind us and eventually disappeared as we continued on.. 

As we were driving, we noticed at least another two dozen semi trucks, flashing their highbeams at us for no apparent reason and driving dangerously close to the centre of the road, if not actually in our lane coming towards us . We started to get really really freaked out at this point thinking maybe there was something wrong on the highway ahead… Or that they had collectively decided just to fuck with us for whatever reason. 
About 20 minutes outside of Revelstoke we are going down what should have been a big hill, but felt like we were going up a steep hill. Confused the crap out of us, but we just kind of added it to the pile of weirdness and carried on. 
All of a sudden, my partner notices that there is a semi truck coming up behind us in a 70s zone doing at least 125 km an hour. We were driving in the right hand lane with the passing lane to our left. My partner Gently tapped the brakes a couple of times and even threw on the hazards for a couple seconds to alert them that they were travelling much faster than us and should prepare to pass. Instead of doing so it appeared that the truck sped up even more and came within a single car length of our rear end before darting over to the left to pass. In that moment, both of us genuinely felt like we were about to be run off the road ( which is an extraordinarily terrifying feeling in itself, let alone when you have an 18 month old babe sleeping in the back seat.) 
It felt extremely aggressive and intentional. After we recovered from the terrifying ordeal, we realized that that was the exact truck that had allowed us to pass them between the first and second set of snow shelters. 
After we arrived back home in Kelowna, I realized that our trip took us nearly 13 hours instead of 9.5. We were driving at or a little over the speed limit the entire time with about an hour and half to two hours worth of stops for gas, coffee, leg stretching, baby changing and feeding…etc. And we followed google maps instructions the entire way. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for by posting this other than maybe looking for some validation that others have had weird experiences on that drive too. 
Please help 😅 I feel crazy.

1gg51op,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gg51op,Backpack stolen in Columbus Café,"Hi all! Since my arrival in Montreal this August I've been thoroughly enjoying the city and its kind inhabitants. However, today I was confronted with some far less kind (read: horrible) people: these two men on the picture stole my green backpack when I was having a coffee at Columbus Café at Mont Royal Avenue. In it was among other things my laptop and wallet. I did everything I could think of: blocked my cards/laptop, filed a police report and contacted insurance. I feel devastated and stressed since my laptop is crucial for the research I've been working on. So while the chances are very slim, I'm hoping that with this post I might reach someone that has seen it, knows where to look or will recognize it in the future. The backpack is an elliker dayle roll top, the laptop is an ASUS vivobook 16x. Any help is much appreciated!! Thanks in advance :) ",41,1730344157.0,montreal,7,0.94,False

I saw him again about 5 days later for a drink and he was a lot more flirty, touchy and it went on for about 2 hours. We didn’t kiss but I felt amazing after. He was laying the compliments on pretty thick, but not in an off putting way. Smooth. He then went on a trip to Europe for 10 days but texted me almost every day he was there saying how he wanted to bring me back gifts. During one of the days we were texting, he offered to buy me a lululemon sweater and sent me a screenshot of it and said I would have it in a week. We went for another coffee date when he came back and we were both fully I crush mode I think. We still didn’t kiss at the end of the date but our texts after were much more sexual and confessional. Then I said “oh I’ve been meaning to ask, when can I grab the sweater?” And his tone changed and he said it was in his car and that he would give it to me next time we meet. I said ok great when are you free and he stopped responding all together. I haven’t heard from him in over a week.

1gg4xk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1gg4xk4/i_did_social_freedom_challenges_every_day_for_10/,I Did Social Freedom Challenges Every Day For 10 Years - Here's What Happened,"I am walking up Oxford Street in London. 

One of the busiest shopping streets in the world.

It’s a typically cold, drizzly Saturday morning in March. 

I’ve taken the three-hour coach ride into town to meet up with a friend and do some ‘social freedom challenges’.

Having missed out on so much of life, because of social anxiety, I’ve decided to start trying to face my fears.

This is the first time I’ve tried such a thing and to say I’m nervous is an understatement.

But I’m sick and tired sitting on the sidelines and watching life pass me by, so I’ve come into the Big Smoke to face the dragon head on.

The plan is fairly simple: to make eye contact with and greet as many strangers as possible. 

This sounds like a trivial task for most people. 

But when you’ve spent decades in the grip of social anxiety, it most certainly isn’t.

I’m terrified. 

Coming into the centre of London has taken just about every ounce of my courage.

But I had such high hopes on the coach coming down here.

Images of high-fiving strangers and sparking up conversations with random people danced through my mind.

However, now I’m actually here, the positive expectation of an hour ago has evaporated.

I feel small, scared and nauseous. My skin starts to prickle with sweat.

I feel like a rodent trapped in open ground. Exposed. Vulnerable. Nowhere to run to.

“Let’s get a drink first and chill out for a bit. It’s too hot out here.” I tell my friend, stalling for time.

Inside the coffee shop, I nervously nurse a bottle of sparkling water. Absentmindedly tracing the condensation drops with my fingers while I think.

My stomach is in knots. If I head back to the coach station now, I can be home in time for the Saturday afternoon football match on TV.

At least I tried. This just isn’t for me. Best to head back to the comfort of home.

I can always try again another time. I’m just not ready yet.

“So, shall we get out there then?” Dan suddenly asks, derailing my train of thought.

He also suffered with terrible social anxiety when he was younger. 

But, whereas I avoided my problems, he deliberately moved to London to overcome his fears. 

In the three years that he’d been living here, he’d done thousands of these kinds of challenges. 

To add to the humiliation of defeat I’m starting to feel, I remember that Dan is almost ten years younger than me.

I open my mouth to apologise for wasting his time and give him a litany of empty promises about how I’ll “come down another day” when I’m “feeling more up for it”.

But something stops me before the words have a chance to form.

Macho pride. Male bravado. Masochistic tendencies. Whatever you want to call it. My reply shocks me,

“Yeah, come on. Let’s get after it.”

We step back out into the gloomy bustle of Oxford Street.

People from all corners of the globe throng everywhere.

I restate my intention to start greeting people who come my way. 

I add a bit of authoritative emphasis to try and convince both Dan and myself that I’m going to actually pull it off.

We set off and my eyes scour the hordes of oncoming people for a receptive target.

Eyes are glued to phone screens or deliberately avoid my gaze.

My eyes ricochet quickly from face to face. Everyone's the same.

A legion of iPhone zombies.

This is going to be harder than I thought.

A young guy with dreadlocks about my age walks towards me, eyes roaming free from his phone for a moment.

I nod and say “Hi”.

No recognition. Not even a rude snub, just total blankness.

As he passes, I see why.

His ears are stuffed with white airpods.

How the hell am I going to complete my challenge if everyone is in their own little world?

We press on further past the entrance to the Underground station.

People crisscross from all directions.

I’m feeling self-conscious and shaky. I can feel my face turning red.

The crowd is a blur of colourful shopping bags and grey, deadpan faces.

A busker plays the guitar loudly to my left. His jangling chords are like shattered glass in my ear..

It’s all getting too much.

I can feel an anxiety attack trying to spiral up from the pit of my stomach.

“Hi”, I try again weakly as a woman with jet black straight hair walks by.

This time a quick flick of her eyes shows that she’s registered me, but she’s otherwise unmoved.

It’s no good. 

I’m like a fly bouncing off car windshields.

Too feeble and ineffectual to have any impact.

I begin to question my life choices. I begin to question myself.

“Why the hell am I even down here in London trying to say “Hello” to strangers?! 

Why do I even need to practice something so simple?”

Why was I born like this?”

My mind begins to spiral into bitter thoughts of my childhood and who I can blame for my problems.

But, I’m brought back to reality by a shove from behind as a group of teenagers in Canada Goose jackets push past me.

I need to get out of this crowd.

We decide to cross the road to Regent Street where it’s quieter.

We walk north past the Nike Town store and I stop against a wall to try and compose myself.

“I don’t think I can do this mate”, I tell Dan

The hostility on people’s faces. My own insecurities. It’s all too much.

It wasn’t that long ago that I was totally housebound by my anxiety. 

So, even coming into London has been a success I say, trying to console myself for my failure.

We turn and head back to the Underground station. I will get the tube back to Victoria and take the coach back to the countryside.

There I will sit on my couch and beat myself up incessantly for being so pathetic and failing yet again.

As I envision this and the evening of rumination ahead a surge of courage fills me.

I see a woman, probably in her early sixties, coming towards me.

Before I know what I’m doing, I lock eyes with her and blurt out,

“Hi, how are you?”

The woman’s face is long and drawn, with an almost angry expression.

“Excuse me?”

She stops next to me.

This was a mistake. I should never have done this.

“I..I..was just asking how you are” 

Her face transforms.

The defensive mask cracking into a huge smile. Her previously pinball eyes suddenly light up.

“Oh! I’m fine, thank you.”

She carries on walking. The exchange must only have lasted a matter of seconds, but my whole world has changed.

I am dumbfounded.

The woman was so warm and friendly. But had I not spoken to her, I would only have seen her harsh, dour expression.

In that moment, I realised I had been hoodwinked. Duped. Swindled.

I had been taking people at face value my whole life.

Where I had seen crowds of standoffish, intimidating people, I now saw countless bright souls all cowering behind the defensive armour of scowls, screens and airpods.

It wasn’t just me that was scared to engage. It was everyone.

I had previously thought about how we are all colluding in the depression that is spread by social media. 

We compare and despair over the curated images of other people’s ‘perfect’ lives believing they are OK and we are not.

And yet every person is feeling the same and perpetuating this lie - this insanity by consensus.

But this was the first time I realised we are all also colluding in the mass loneliness and anxiety of the world.

We keep others at bay with our self-defence mechanisms, while all the time dying inside our protective shell for want of the nourishment of human connection.

On that day, I made a promise that I would do my part to break this absurd cycle. I began greeting people wherever I could. Every single day. Without fail.

In elevators. In grocery stores. Waiting in line to top up my phone credit.

In the years since that promise, I have spoken with thousands of strangers from dozens of countries.

And I am always amazed by how interesting and warm most people are. Regardless of how unapproachable they may initially appear to be.

So please don’t buy into the lie. 

Do your part to reverse the insanity we are heading towards as a species. We all have a part to play in the loneliness epidemic.

And it can begin with a simple smile and a “hello”.",5,1730343777.0,selfimprovement,0,0.86,False

While reaching for the coffee I hear a lady ""excuse me"" since I was the only one in the aisle with het I took out my earphone and asked if I could help her.

Every once in a while, I would message her, just asking how she was, what she’s been up to, etc. She, for some reason, did NOT like when I did this. So 2 months ago she called for no contact, blocking me on almost everything. I think this is unfair. I felt like me checking up on her, was not wrong for me to do. I don’t understand why she got upset with me for it.

Since I had no way of contacting her, I decided to use my best friend’s phone. He is very protective of his phone, so I know he wouldn’t allow me to use it. One night I managed to go into his room and take it. Now I know, this was not good of me to do, but I really needed to text my ex.

I managed to get into his phone. I knew his password was his birthday cuz he mentioned it a while back. When I started to put in my girlfriend’s phone number, I noticed that it was already in his phone. I thought that was strange, so I clicked on her contact and saw flirty messages between the both of them.

I felt distraught. How could my “friend” do this to me. 

I texted her saying it was me, and then I asked “how could you get with my best friend behind my back?” I said how it was unreasonable and just not fair to me. After I sent the message, my roommate caught me and started yelling at me, asking why I was on his phone in the middle of the night.

I yelled back, stating it was unfair for him to get with my ex and he should end it with her. He said no and snatched his phone back, telling me to get out. I just left, not wanting to start a fight. 

I went to the nearest IHOP to grab a cup of coffee and text my mom. I didn’t give her all of the details, just asking if I could stay for the night, she said yes.

The next morning I woke up to messages from my roommate. He was saying how he’s kicking me out of the apartment and to never attempt to contact him, nor my ex ever again. I feel like this isn’t fair. I’ve known both of them for years, how can they just do this to me?

We've all heard the saying, ""A small act of kindness can change the world."" But how often do we really believe it? I used to think these were just empty words until one unexpected moment transformed my perspective. Here’s my story.

It was a typical Tuesday morning, and I was running late for work, feeling the weight of deadlines and responsibilities. My morning coffee run turned chaotic when I discovered I’d forgotten my wallet. Stressed and embarrassed, I turned to leave the café when a stranger tapped me on the shoulder.

This man, probably in his late 30s, offered to pay for my coffee. I was taken aback; I hesitated, but he insisted with a warm smile. It was just a few dollars, yet in that moment, it felt like so much more. I thanked him profusely, and we struck up a brief conversation about life and stress.

After that encounter, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude. Inspired, I decided to pay it forward. Later that week, I bought lunch for a coworker who was going through a tough time. This small act sparked a chain reaction. My coworker started bringing in treats for the office, and soon others joined in, creating a wave of positivity.

What I learned from that simple coffee gesture was profound. Kindness can be contagious. It doesn’t take much to make someone’s day, and these small moments can lead to greater connections and community. 

I challenge everyone reading this to perform one small act of kindness this week. Whether it’s buying coffee for the person behind you, leaving a note of encouragement for a friend, or simply smiling at a stranger, you have the power to create a ripple effect. Let’s make kindness the norm and see how it transforms our lives and those around us.

Hello guys I really need your help/experiences…

So I quit caffeine 8 weeks ago. The reason I quit was that I got sick mid August. When I am sick I usually don‘t drink coffee. I used to drink up to 4 cups of coffee a day. Also I started drinking energy drinks frequently this year. Not the forget other sodas and chocolate. 

After a few days of being sick I started to feel a weird feeling in my head. It is really hard to explain for I never had this feeling before: It kinda feels like I‘m dizzy but it‘s not really dizziness. Also head feels somehow heavy and a bit tingling or something… During the span of 2 weeks I felt very fatigued. I also went to the ER, the Doctor told me she thinks it‘s the infection that causes these symptoms and that I should just recover a bit more. (I had no idea about caffeine withdrawals at this point and I unintentionally tapered down my intake in thosw 2 weeks)

My symptoms got better and for 1,5 weeks I felt pretty normal again. I also think that I just had one coffee a day these days because I suffered from Insomnia during my 2 weeks of hell. Then one day I ended up having like 4 cups of coffees and a small coke again. I already felt a bit nauseas in the evening. Then I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night with a panic attack. I also felt this weird feeling in my head again as I described before. The next morning I looked up if u can feel like that bc if too much coffee. After my research I decided to quit caffeine for good. I also quit nicotine the same day!

The first 4 weeks were awful. Here are all the symptoms I had:

- Most importantly this weird feeling in my head
- brain fog
- headaches
- flu like symptoms coming and going in those 4 weeks
- anxiety and panic attacks
- pain in my body, especially back pain a few days
- 3 days I had shortness of breath
- sometimes a tightness in my thorat
- nausea
- insomnia
- tiredness
- fatigue

… maybe I forgot some

After those 4 weeks my symptoms got better and after week 5 I almost felt completly normal again besides some moments, but the smyptoms didn‘t last long, maybe like an hour. 

Now, one week ago this stupid feeling in my head started again and wouldn‘t go away since… And whats new now since yesterday is a tingling in my hands. At this point I am just scared.

Has anybody experienced similiar things when quitting caffeine? Or am I just going crazy at this point and my symptoms are bc of anxiety? Or even maybe Post-Covid? I really don‘t know what to do anymore…

I also went to the neurologist this week, they measured my blood flow, all normal. I didn‘t really get an answer tbh, she said she thinks it‘s bc of different factors like both qutting caffeine and nicotine but also the infection and stress. She told me I should do a MRI but it‘s really hard to get an early appointment, what I found so far would be in Februrary…

Does anyone of you has an Idea what my situation is…? Is it just my body healing from my addiction or something else? I need some encouragement in those darkest times of my life.",2,1730343122.0,CaffeineFreeLife,1,1.0,False

I'm planning a remote work + surf trip from November 8th to December 8th and would love some advice on a spot. Here’s a bit about me and what I’m looking for:

* **Internet for Remote Work**: I’ll be working remotely with core hours from 10:30 am to 3 pm ET (so I'm somewhat limited to South and Central America, and Western Europe to work reasonable hours)
* **Air Canada Access**: I fly standby with Air Canada from Toronto, so I’d like somewhere they service.
* **Surf Background**: I’m a pretty beginner surfer but can pop up and ride green waves (goofy) on typically a 7'4"" hardtop. I would rent. I’ve done surf trips to Tamarindo in November and Ericeira in September. I’m a strong swimmer and have a lot of experience wakesurfing (I know it doesn’t count for much, but just for context on ability). Tamarindo was busy but I didn't mind since no one was aggressive. Ericerica I surfed Praia de Ribeira d'Ilhas and Foz do Lizandro which wasn't as easy as Tamarindo.
* **Ideal Conditions**: I’m looking for a consistent, beginner-friendly wave that's conducive to improving as a beginner surfer. I plan to surf daily before or after work.
* **Walkability**: I’ll be without a car, so I’d prefer a walkable town where I can find accommodation close to the beach, ideally walking distance to surf spots, food, and coffee spots.
* **Budget Considerations**: I’d love to keep costs reasonable, so I’m weighing the options between Costa Rica (Santa Teresa or Playa Hermosa) and Mexico (Sayulita or Puerto Escondido). Costa Rica seems a bit pricier than Mexico. I'm fine with spending more for a better location. 

Here are some spots I’m considering:

* **Puerto Escondido (La Punta)**: I love the idea of La Punta’s wave, but I’ve heard it can get very busy, even aggressive at times. Do you think it would be packed in November?
* **Santa Teresa or Playa Hermosa, Costa Rica**: These look beautiful and beginner-friendly but seem more expensive than Mexico.
* **Peniche, Portugal**: Seems like a good cooler-water option and no need to deal with humidity, but I’m wondering about wave consistency for beginners in November. 

I also considered Taghazout, Morocco and Juan Del Sur, Nicaragua but I don't think waves are as walkable a distance. 

Any insights on these spots or recommendations are greatly appreciated!!! I know it's not really possible to hit all these criteria I just wanted to give a complete picture. Truly any help is appreciated :) ",4,1730342855.0,BeginnerSurfers,3,1.0,False

One of the busiest shopping streets in the world.

It’s a typically cold, drizzly Saturday morning in March. 

I’ve taken the three-hour coach ride into town to meet up with a friend and do some ‘social freedom challenges’.

Having missed out on so much of life, because of social anxiety, I’ve decided to start trying to face my fears.

This is the first time I’ve tried such a thing and to say I’m nervous is an understatement.

But I’m sick and tired sitting on the sidelines and watching life pass me by, so I’ve come into the Big Smoke to face the dragon head on.

The plan is fairly simple: to make eye contact with and greet as many strangers as possible. 

This sounds like a trivial task for most people. 

But when you’ve spent decades in the grip of social anxiety, it most certainly isn’t.

I’m terrified. 

Coming into the centre of London has taken just about every ounce of my courage.

But my high hopes overrode my fears.

On the coach down here images of high-fiving strangers and sparking up conversations with random people danced through my mind.

However, now I’m actually here, the positive expectation of an hour ago has evaporated.

I feel small, scared and nauseous. My skin starts to prickle with sweat.

I feel like a rodent trapped in open ground. Exposed. Vulnerable. Nowhere to run to.

“Let’s get a drink first and chill out for a bit.” I tell my friend, stalling for time.

Inside the coffee shop, I nervously nurse a bottle of sparkling water. Absentmindedly tracing the condensation drops with my fingers while I think.

My stomach is in knots. If I head back to the coach station now, I can be home in time for the Saturday afternoon football match on TV.

At least I tried. This just isn’t for me. Best to head back to the comfort of home.

I can always try again another time. I’m just not ready yet.

“So, shall we get out there then?” Dan suddenly asks, derailing my train of thought.

He also suffered with terrible social anxiety when he was younger. 

But, whereas I avoided my problems, he deliberately moved to London to overcome his fears. 

In the three years that he’d been living here, he’d done thousands of these kinds of challenges. 

To add to the humiliation of defeat I’m starting to feel, I remember that Dan is almost ten years younger than me.

I open my mouth to apologise for wasting his time and give him a litany of empty promises about how I’ll “come down another day” when I’m “feeling more up for it”.

But something stops me before the words have a chance to form.

Macho pride. Male bravado. Masochistic tendencies. Whatever you want to call it. My reply shocks me,

“Yeah, come on. Let’s get after it.”

We step back out into the gloomy bustle of Oxford Street.

People from all corners of the globe throng everywhere.

I restate my intention to start greeting people who come my way. 

I add a bit of authoritative emphasis to try and convince both Dan and myself that I’m going to actually pull it off.

We set off and my eyes scour the hordes of oncoming people for a receptive target.

Eyes are glued to phone screens or deliberately avoid my gaze.

My eyes ricochet quickly from face to face. Everyone's the same.

A legion of iPhone zombies.

This is going to be harder than I thought.

A young guy with dreadlocks about my age walks towards me, eyes untethered from his phone for a moment.

I nod and say “Hi”.

No recognition. Not even a rude snub, just total blankness.

As he passes, I see why.

His ears are stuffed with white airpods.

How the hell am I going to complete my challenge if everyone is in their own little world?

We press on further past the entrance to the Underground station.

People crisscross from all directions.

I’m feeling self-conscious and shaky. I can feel my face turning red.

The crowd is a blur of colourful shopping bags and grey, deadpan faces.

A busker plays the guitar loudly to my left. His jangling chords are like shattered glass in my ear.

It’s all getting too much.

I can feel an anxiety attack trying to spiral up from the pit of my stomach.

“Hi”, I try again weakly as a woman with jet black straight hair walks by.

This time a quick flick of her eyes shows that she’s registered me, but she’s otherwise unmoved.

It’s no good. 

I’m like a fly bouncing off car windshields.

Too feeble and ineffectual to have any impact.

I begin to question my life choices. I begin to question myself.

“Why the hell am I even down here in London trying to say “Hello” to strangers?!"" 

""Why do I even need to practice something so simple?”

""Why was I born like this?”

My mind begins to spiral into bitter thoughts of my childhood and who I can blame for my problems.

But, I’m brought back to reality by a shove from behind as a group of teenagers in Canada Goose jackets push past me.

I need to get out of this crowd.

We decide to cross the road to Regent Street where it’s quieter.

We walk north past the Nike Town store and I stop against a wall to try and compose myself.

“I don’t think I can do this mate”, I tell Dan

The hostility on people’s faces. My own insecurities. It’s all too much.

It wasn’t that long ago that I was totally housebound by my anxiety. 

So, even coming into London has been a success I say, trying to console myself for my failure.

We turn and head back to the Underground station. I will get the tube back to Victoria and take the coach back to the countryside.

There I will sit on my couch and beat myself up incessantly for being so pathetic and failing yet again.

As I envision this and the evening of rumination ahead a surge of courage fills me.

I see a woman, probably in her early sixties, coming towards me.

Before I know what I’m doing, I lock eyes with her and blurt out,

“Hi, how are you?”

The woman’s face is long and drawn, with an almost angry expression.

“Excuse me?”

She stops next to me.

This was a mistake. I should never have done this.

“I..I..was just asking how you are” 

Her face transforms.

The defensive mask cracking into a huge smile. Her previously pinball eyes suddenly light up.

“Oh! I’m fine, thank you.”

She carries on walking. The exchange must only have lasted a matter of seconds, but my whole world has changed.

I am dumbfounded.

The woman was so warm and friendly. But had I not spoken to her, I would only have seen her harsh, dour expression.

In that moment, I realised I had been hoodwinked. Duped. Swindled.

I had been taking people at face value my whole life.

Where I had seen crowds of standoffish, intimidating people, I now saw countless bright souls all cowering behind the defensive armour of scowls, screens and airpods.

It wasn’t just me that was scared to engage. It was everyone.

I had previously thought about how we are all colluding in the depression that is spread by social media. 

We compare and despair over the curated images of other people’s ‘perfect’ lives believing they are OK and we are not.

And yet every person is feeling the same and perpetuating this lie - this insanity by consensus.

But this was the first time I realised we are all also colluding in the mass loneliness and anxiety of the world.

We keep others at bay with our self-defence mechanisms, while all the time dying inside our protective shell for want of the nourishment of human connection.

On that day, I made a promise that I would do my part to break this absurd cycle. I began greeting people wherever I could. Every single day. Without fail.

In elevators. In grocery stores. Waiting in line to top up my phone credit.

In the years since that promise, I have spoken with thousands of strangers from dozens of countries.

And I am always amazed by how interesting and warm most people are. Regardless of how unapproachable they may initially appear to be.

So please don’t buy into the lie. 

Do your part to reverse the insanity we are heading towards as a species. We all have a part to play in the loneliness epidemic.

And it can begin with a simple smile and a “hello”.",3,1730342245.0,socialanxiety,1,0.81,False

1gg4fp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gg4fp6/am_i_loosing_my_mind_help/,Am I loosing my mind? HELP!!!,"Hello guys I really need your help/experiences…

So I quit caffeine 8 weeks ago. The reason I quit was that I got sick mid August. When I am sick I usually don‘t drink coffee. I used to drink up to 4 cups of coffee a day. Also I started drinking energy drinks frequently this year. Not the forget other sodas and chocolate. 

After a few days of being sick I started to feel a weird feeling in my head. It is really hard to explain for I never had this feeling before: It kinda feels like I‘m dizzy but it‘s not really dizziness. Also head feels somehow heavy and a bit tingling or something… During the span of 2 weeks I felt very fatigued. I also went to the ER, the Doctor told me she thinks it‘s the infection that causes these symptoms and that I should just recover a bit more. (I had no idea about caffeine withdrawals at this point and I unintentionally tapered down my intake in thosw 2 weeks)

My symptoms got better and for 1,5 weeks I felt pretty normal again. I also think that I just had one coffee a day these days because I suffered from Insomnia during my 2 weeks of hell. Then one day I ended up having like 4 cups of coffees and a small coke again. I already felt a bit nauseas in the evening. Then I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night with a panic attack. I also felt this weird feeling in my head again as I described before. The next morning I looked up if u can feel like that bc if too much coffee. After my research I decided to quit caffeine for good. I also quit nicotine the same day!

The first 4 weeks were awful. Here are all the symptoms I had:

- Most importantly this weird feeling in my head
- brain fog
- headaches
- flu like symptoms coming and going in those 4 weeks
- anxiety and panic attacks
- pain in my body, especially back pain a few days
- 3 days I had shortness of breath
- sometimes a tightness in my thorat
- nausea
- insomnia
- tiredness
- fatigue

… maybe I forgot some

After those 4 weeks my symptoms got better and after week 5 I almost felt completly normal again besides some moments, but the smyptoms didn‘t last long, maybe like an hour. 

Now, one week ago this stupid feeling in my head started again and wouldn‘t go away since… And whats new now since yesterday is a tingling in my hands. At this point I am just scared.

Has anybody experienced similiar things when quitting caffeine? Or am I just going crazy at this point and my symptoms are bc of anxiety? Or even maybe Post-Covid? I really don‘t know what to do anymore…

I also went to the neurologist this week, they measured my blood flow, all normal. I didn‘t really get an answer tbh, she said she thinks it‘s bc of different factors like both qutting caffeine and nicotine but also the infection and stress. She told me I should do a MRI but it‘s really hard to get an early appointment, what I found so far would be in Februrary…

There are different versions of these lyrics, but I grew up with the cast album of the 1957 Broadway version. The song is a sort of conversation between a group of Puerto Rican girls who miss Puerto Rico and a group who prefer Manhattan. The introduction is sung by Rosalia and Anita:

**ROSALIA**  
Puerto Rico,  
You lovely island . . .  
Island of tropical breezes.  
Always the pineapples growing,  
Always the coffee blossoms blowing

**ANITA**  
Puerto Rico . . .  
You ugly island . . .  
Island of tropic diseases.  
Always the hurricanes blowing,  
Always the population growing . . .  
And the money owing,  
And the babies crying,  
And the bullets flying.  
I like the island Manhattan.  
Smoke on your pipe and put that in!

The song then continues in that vein, often going back and forth line by line.

Now, to be fair, the lyrics were written by Stephen Sondheim, not a Puerto Rican, but I can't help but think that Anita might have agreed with that comic.",0,1730342089.0,TheGist,1,0.5,False

[One of the darkest on-set events to happen in Hollywood history is the helicopter accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie. It was the last day of shooting, and star Vic Morrow, along with child actors Renee Shin-Yi Chen and Myca Dinh Le (ages six and seven), were shooting a Vietnam War battle scene. While running from the helicopter, it lost control and crashed into the three actors, killing them. The scene was deleted from the final film, but the overall segment starring Vic Morrow was still included when the film was released in 1983.](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/actor-and-two-children-killed-on-twilight-zone-set)
2. The shoot had flouted safety restrictions before. According to crew members, Landis also decided earlier in the shoot that real shotguns and live ammunition would be used in a scene. After seeing the shotguns, Morrow initially refused to film but was coaxed back into the shot by Landis. According to crew members, Morrow then had to run to avoid the gunfire.
3. [Real ammunition was also used in the 1985 film Come and See, and the actors were shot at with live rounds, with bullets apparently passing inches from their heads. There's also a scene where a cow is shot with a machine gun — this really happened. And Aleksey Kravchenko, who was 14 when he began filming, was reportedly forced to adhere to a ""starvation diet"" during parts of filming in order to appear emaciated.](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/ww2-film-come-and-see-used-live-ammunition/)
4. [Speaking of animal cruelty on set, the tiger in Life of Pi almost died during filming. An on-set monitor wrote in a leaked email, ""Last week we almost fucking killed King [the Bengal used in the film when the CGI version was not realistic enough] in the water tank. This one take with him went really bad and he got lost trying to swim to the side. Damn near drowned. I think this goes without saying but don't mention it to anyone, especially the office! I have downplayed the fuck out of it.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/amatullahshaw/book-emoji-quiz)
5. [Using wild animals in movies — especially big cats — has an extremely sordid history. Perhaps most famously, a bunch of the actors involved in Roar (which featured ""132 big cats, one elephant, three aoudad sheep, and a collection of ostriches, flamingos, marabou, storks, and black swans,"" according to star Tippi Hedren) were injured by the animals. Writer/director/producer/Tippi's then-husband Noel Marshall literally had to star because no other male star wanted to work with that many dangerous animals. The other stars were Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, and two of Marshall's sons.](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/noel-marshalls-roar-humans-were-harmed-in-the-making-of-this-film)
6. [The same cannot be said for the monkey star of the Every Which Way But Loose sequel Any Which Way You Can, who allegedly died after being beaten by his trainer. Author Dale Peterson and chimp expert Jane Goodall claimed the chimp had suffered abuse for years, originally having been trained using mace and a pipe wrapped in newspaper. Before filming began, a book by Peterson and Goodall claimed he'd been beaten to make him more docile. When his work was almost done on the film, he was reportedly caught stealing donuts on set. He was then allegedly beaten for 20 minutes with an axe handle and died of a cerebral hemorrhage.](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-aug-27-et-brief27-story.html#:~:text=Near%20the%20end%20of%20filming,after%20of%20a%20cerebral%20hemorrhage.)
7. [And do you remember the Disney movie Snow Buddies? The filmmakers brought in 30 golden retriever puppies to use in the direct-to-DVD movie, but they used only 15 in the initial filming. Why? The other 15 puppies were sick with giardia and coccidia. It turns out the puppies were only six weeks old, two weeks shy of the age requirements for using puppies in film (which are in place because younger dogs shouldn't be separated from their mothers and are at increased risk of illness). Parvovirus had also been rampant in the area for six months and infected many of the puppies. Five of the puppies ended up dying.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristenharris1/disney-animated-movie-ranking)
8. [This isn't Disney's first instance of animal cruelty. A number of lemmings were allegedly purposely killed in the 1958 Disney documentary White Wilderness, popularizing the myth that the rodents engage in mass suicide. As it turns out, the filmmakers reportedly pushed the lemmings off the cliff to fake the shot. In fact, kids were allegedly paid to capture and bring lemmings to Canada (where lemmings are not native) in order for them to be killed for the film.](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=56)
9. [But we can't speak about animal cruelty without discussing Cannibal Holocaust. The film was so horrifically violent and offensive that in Italy, director Ruggero Deodato was charged with obscenity and later murder after it was suspected that some of the actors had actually died in the film. The actors literally had to come to court to prove they were alive. Deodato was also charged with animal cruelty (though it was later overturned) because multiple animals had been killed onscreen.](https://www.cbr.com/cannibal-holocaust-director-was-charged-with-murder/)
10. [The notorious flop The Conqueror wasn't just famous for being genuinely terrible — it also may have killed dozens who worked on it. The film was shot near a nuclear testing site, where a high amount of fallout accumulated right near the movie location. Star John Wayne was reportedly aware of this fact — he apparently took his sons to look at the massive radiation spikes registered on a Geiger counter. The film was shot for thirteen weeks, then subjected the cast and crew to additional exposure when director Howard Hughes shipped in 60 tons of the radioactive dirt for reshoots.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/movie-toxic-killed-john-wayne-tragedy-conqueror/)
11. [Something similar may have happened with Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film was shot in an abandoned hydroelectric power station in Estonia, downstream from a chemical power plant. Tarkovsky, his wife Larissa, and star Anatoly Solonitsyn all later died of cancer, which sound recordist Vladimir Sharun believes was caused by the radiation exposure on the set.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/06/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-russia-gulags-chernobyl)
12. [Jeepers Creepers was ruined for me when I learned that its director, Victor Salva, had previously been convicted of the sexual assault of the 12-year-old star of his film Clownhouse (which was funded by Francis Ford Coppola), as well as of filming the encounter and possessing child sexual abuse images.

[Léon: the Professional (originally released as The Professional in America) is made all the more creepy when you know that it was likely inspired by a real relationship the director, Luc Besson, had with a teenager. Luc Besson was 31 when he began dating a 15-year-old named Maïwenn, who he had known since she was 12. The two had a child when Maïwenn was 16 and married. She later said, ""When Luc Besson did Léon, the story of a 13-year-old girl in love with an older man, it was very inspired by us since it was written while our story started. But no media made the link.""](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/luc-besson-leon-the-professional-truth/)
14. [One of the most disturbing behind-the-scenes facts about Candyman is that real bees were used in the scene where bees emerge from Candyman's mouth. Star Tony Todd wore only a dental dam to protect himself so the bees would not fly directly down his throat, but he was still stung many times. ""I negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for every sting during the bee scene. And I got stung 23 times. Everything that's worth making has to involve some sort of pain,"" Todd revealed.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/25/how-we-made-candyman-virginia-madsen-tony-todd-bee-sting)
15. [A lesser-known creepy fact about the film is that Virginia Madsen, who played Helen, was hypnotized before scenes with Todd to put her into a trance. It was effective — Madsen said that after being hypnotized, she ""really couldn't see the crew,"" and ""all the lights became very, very blurry."" In fact, it worked so well that it freaked Madsen out — after she couldn't even remember a full day of shooting, she refused to be hypnotized again.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/25/how-we-made-candyman-virginia-madsen-tony-todd-bee-sting)

18. [Multiple films have used real skeletons rather than fake ones, including Frankenstein, Poltergeist, and Dawn of the Dead.

To make her look younger in the film, star Judy Garland was reportedly put on a diet of black coffee, chicken soup, diet pills, cigarettes (80 a day), and amphetamines. Her ex-husband Sid Luft also claimed that the 40-something munchkin actors would grope her on set by putting their hands under her dress.

She and I are not very sexually active, but we decided to try something out of pure curiosity and the heat of the moment. She decided to sit on the head of my penis, but it didn't go much further than that. She only stayed there for a short time (about 1 minute) and nothing went further other than the head.
I didn't ejaculate inside her, but we're afraid she got pregnant from the pre-cum.

I was already doubting this fact because the penis didn't go all the way in, not even half, making the fertilization process much more difficult. And my research has shown that there are far fewer sperm in the pre-cum for proper fertilization to occur, and the ones that do come are usually defective.

This happened a week ago, and so far the only signs given are that it could be confused with periods.
For the first two days, she had a brownish discharge on her genitals when she put her finger in to check. The first time it looked like coffee and the second time it was lighter and never appeared again. We were scared because if it was a period it'd be normal for this to only get worse (more brownish) over time, but it was the opposite.
In the last few days, from yesterday to today, she put her finger in again to check and it came out whitish and odorless.

She hasn't had her period since the beginning of the month, and we thought it was strange, since her period was around the end of the month.
As far as she remembers, she wasn't in her fertile period when it all happened, but she doesn't remember the last few days she had her period, so I don't know if it would be very appropriate to take that into consideration.

We're afraid to use pills or something like that for fear of our parents' reaction, so if everything indicates pregnancy we don't know what to do. Can anyone help us?


Before i forget about it, i've told basically everything to ChatGPT, which he said the odds were really low, due to only the head being inside and some other factors, and the delay in her period could be from this stress we're both facing. I've read about it on the internet and i've learn this type of emotions can affect periods, so i don't really doubt it.

1gg49td,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1gg49td/guardianship/,Guardianship,"My sister and I decided to co-apply for guardianship of our parent. When the attorney sent the application to be notarized I got it done the same day and my sister said she’d be unable to for several more days. Our parent was in a situation of urgent need of a guardian to get her into a proper care situation so frustrated that she was causing unnecessary delay I politely suggested that I’d be able to do the full guardianship if she was too busy to handle it. She took extreme offense to that statement and completely severed communication. The next time we met with the attorney he advised that we can proceed as co-guardians (separately applying for person and estate) but in case the judge wanted just one of us to be full guardian we needed to be prepared to give an answer and we can’t be in disagreement. We talked privately and went back and forth in circles for hours and got nowhere, she was being completely irrational. I asked the attorney if med-arb was an (both of us paying our share, attending voluntarily and the outcome is legally binding and not appealable). He said yes and can locate the mediator for us. I asked my sister to reimburse me half of the attorney’s retainer I had paid and a few weeks later she transferred me the full amount instead of half. I assumed she thought somehow by giving me the full amount I’d just let her take over and do what she wanted, I planned to sent half back afterwards. We held our med-arb session and it was determined that I should be the guardian. She then revealed that the money she “reimbursed” me was from our Mom’s account! Shortly following the call I received the docusign and signed. Two days later my sister still had not signed. She was attempting to have modifications added to the document and refusing to sign until her unreasonable demands are met and her behavior became extremely erratic. She shipped a best brother coffee mug to my house from Amazon with a really nasty gift note, changed my name in her contacts to backstabber, blocked my number, etc. Worried about my sister’s behavior and that she took money from her, I began helping my Mom in preparation for becoming her legal guardian and got my sister off her bank accounts and me added and my Mom had a locksmith rekey her house so she could get some of her belongings because my sister had her only house keys. The attorney said he’d proceed with filing the application for me to be guardian then he suddenly received notice from the attorney ad litem appointed by the judge to represent our Mom that she had filed an emergency show cause hearing over lies my sister told her and for conducting mediation without notifying the attorney ad litem. It turns out my sister doesn’t have any money except what she gets from her husband and what she takes from our Mom and over the last 2 years is over $45,000 so she got the attorney ad litem to basically represent and fight for her at the expense of the ward’s estate. At the show cause hearing I felt that the attorney ad litem was attacking me and making me out to be a controlling manipulator trying to keep my sister from our Mom which is completely opposite of the truth because it’s based on the lies my sister fed her. I also felt that our attorney did not defend me or correct her statements with facts and did not call out my sister who is now under investigation by Adult Protective Services for financial abuse because she is still his client too and if he called her out he’d have to contest out and we’d both need new attorneys, but if he has to protect her then how can he adequately represent me? I feel that I’d rather have a new attorney to represent me independently before our next status hearing. The Judge sounds like he wants to appoint a private guardian.

Hi guys, just wanted to ask a quick question and see what you all think, ive taken a break the last maybe 7/8 weeks from working out, not for any medical reasons or anything It was my birthday month and I turned 30 so had a few things planned for it as well as other events I had going on too so I thought it was the right time for a break, usually I’m fairly good whenever I’m on my break but this time round there was a lot of drinking and binge eating involved and I ended up gaining substantial weight and my belly has gotten back to an outtie daddy belly and my muscles have all gotten flat, whenever I am training I do fastened cardio 4-5 days a week and do full body workouts for every session with a 20 minute cardio session at the end first thing in the morning. Before  taking a break I was 81kg and now I’m 84kg, I’m 5’6 (168cm) my training diet is very clean, for breakfast id have quick oats with banana, lunch I have 3/4 eggs a day with smoked salmon or prawns or ham/chicken and a cup of coffee and for dinner I would have some salad, rice and whatever source of protein I would have that day, I know a lot of it will probably be water weight but I’m curious to see how long you think it would take me to get back to my 81kg mark.

1gg4797,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gg4797/my_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_but_i_feel_he_may/,"My Boyfriend broke up with me, but I feel he may not be sure","I'd like to start off with I don't need advice like, never speak to him again, or anything like that, I've already had one friend say something similar. The advice I need is ""understanding"" some of what he said and what others think of if it sounds like he isn't sure. Sorry if this is a little long and not straight to the point I also want to just write out some of the things I liked in our romantic relationship.

With that out of the way he and I were dating for about 2 and a half months, but have been very close friends for more than a decade. Our friendship has always been different, very close, closer than others, but we have never been good at staying in contact. Whenever we have reconnected we have picked right up as if no time had passed. He reached out to reconnect about a month before we started dating, from about a week after reconnecting I new something was different, he was texting more often then in the past.

When we started dating I would wonder when I would feel love for him, what it would feel like, when I would know, etc. I dwelled on that for about a week but at some point just stopped and started enjoying our relationship. Now that he broke up with me I realize that I had serious feelings for him, probably not the level of love, but close. It was great for the first month. He was very romantic, we went to Karaoke his singing was amazing, never new he had a voice like that, that was also the first time we danced. He asked when someone was singing a slow song, I liked that so much. I invited him over one night so we could watch a show he brought a soda over for me, we watched about 3 hours of that show and cuddled on the couch throughout. One of the biggest things that hurt that first month was within about a week of us starting dating he confided in me a major event that happened in his life that changed him. I wrote about it here from another throw away account. But it broke my heart, and made me realize how valuable, meaningful and important friends are, how you can't take them for granted, and can't let them slip away for you may never be able to see them again. That hurt so much because he is the kind of friend that you are lucky to find one friend as good as him once in your life. I'm tearing up writing this.

But then after all the great times the first month, he lost his job at the beginning of the second. He was fired, he had found a new job real quick, started working but went from working 3 days a week to 5 days a week. He started pulling away, it was harder to spend time with him. Then about 2 weeks before he broke up he rarely texted me. He stood me up one day, he had slept in, I understand that, but it hurt when even after he woke up he didn't let me know that he wasn't feeling up to it. He then went on a trip to a festival and was MIA for most of that time. The day after he got back is when he broke up with me. About 5 days later we had coffee so I could ask more questions now that I had my wits about me.

My initial thought was that something had happened at the festival, but he told me at coffee that nothing happened. His reasoning for the break up is that he's been waiting for feelings of love to develop in a romantic sense, but that that just didn't develop. He said that any love that he has for me is more toward our decades long friendship, and how I am his oldest, closest and most cherished friend. I asked him what prompted him to think about this, and he said that his trip to the festival got him outside his comfort zone and allowed him to take a look back at his life here. I asked him if there was ""something"" / a ""connection"" something more there than ""lust/sex"" and he said yes we did / do have something deeper than that but that it doesn't extend to the level of love toward me.

I told him thank you for the break up, even though it feels like shit, I wasn't happy the last couple weeks, with how distant he was, not communicating much, not spending much time together. I also expressed how I regret not asking for us to ""take a break"", return to being friends for a time and let him get his life back on track, get back to a better place for him to put in what's needed for a relationship, back to where we were before he was fired. How I feel we may be in a different spot not necessarily now but in a few months if I had had the guts to ask. The past is the past, hind sight is 20/20, but the kind of friends we are I feel a break would have worked, remove the expectations of a relationship, allow him to get back to a good spot and then restart things.

I had asked him why he decided to reconnect 4 months ago. He said he didn't know, that I had come into his mind, that he had started at his now former job was stressed and wanted to be around someone (me) that he knew he could just be himself around. That he felt he had to filter himself at work and that he's never had to filter himself around me. I had asked him why he asked to start dating, I didn't note down his exact response but he said that it felt right, and still feels those same ways about me, just not to the level of love. I then asked some questions that may not be necessarily my business, but knew he would answer I asked him how many of 2 women he dated did he tell about what happened to him, he said he told one of them about it some time after they broke up, and the other was some time during their relationship. I asked about some of the guys he's been in relationships with, he's been in 2, he said that he never felt like he was able to be himself with them, that he felt most comfortable with me (gave similar reasons as above).

I had also told him how what happened to him made me feel, how the night that he told me I could immediately clear as day vivid detail see it right in front of me, and how that will always be with me, when ever it comes into my mind that same vivid image pops into my mind as well. I was tearing up a little as I was telling him about that and he got up, came over to me and pulled my head into his chest/stomach area for a hug.

Probably about 30 minutes into talking to him he had said that he would still be into and ok with us cuddling, maybe around the time that he gave me that hug. Later on he made a comment about me sounding spiteful and I joked that I won't Lorena Bobbitt him (chop his dick off). He made me laugh because he didn't know what I was referring to, who hasn't heard of Lorena Bobbitt, but I digress. He said ""I thought you liked my dick"", told him I do, we talked about a few other things on that subject and he said ""I will leave this for you to initiate and I don't want you to feel taken advantage of (or something like that), but I wouldn't be opposed to us having sex on occasion (again or something similar, it was better put, nicer way, I'm summarizing of course)"".

Some quick clarifiers I am gay, he is Bi. He came out to me a couple weeks after we reconnected, and I came out to him a week after he came out to me. So when he reconnected with me he didn't know I was gay. Another thing is that we both went into our romantic relationship with the understanding that if it didn't work out that we COULD NOT let anything get in the way of our friendship, simply too important, long running, and meaningful. Another thing is the day before he told me how he felt about me and we started dating he had made a statement similar to ""I'd like to retire on a boat, and it would be nice to pour a drink and have drinks with you"".

Now with all that said, what I want some ""advice"" on. To me some of what he said seems counter to other things he's said. He said that he doesn't feel love for me, but that he felt most comfortable with me, that he could be himself, not filter himself, etc. Some of how he described his feelings toward me as a friend, that he has love toward me, but not in the romantic sense. How he's open to us still cuddling, and sex if I want to. He always focussed so much on me during sex, he new how I get stuck in my head, and would always do things in an effort to make sure I was in the present he would jokingly harass me to be in the present, and ""get the fuck out of your head"". I don't know, I just need some thoughts on this, because the way he said some of the things, that are making me wonder, were said in a genuine caring way if that makes sense.

Thank you for any thoughts, or advice on what he means. Even if people feel that he may not be sure or know what he wants, that he may ask to start things back up. I need my friend back and am moving forward either way under the assumption the romantic relationship is over, that there is no ""getting back together"", and we are going back to the kind of friends we were before. I guess the biggest thing is if people feel that he may not know or be sure of himself that I may simply say to him ""If you develop more serious feelings for me later on, please be sure of yourself before telling me, but I'm moving forward as if that won't happen"".

EDIT: I had also asked him what gender he sees himself settling down with, he didn't really have much of an answer but did say that he would like to have a child of his own someday.",0,1730341463.0,askgaybros,0,0.5,False

In the meantime, while I save up a bit to get a grinder, I would like to use the bambino plus with the pressurized dial with already ground coffee beans. Can I ask my local coffee shop to grind some coffee beans or are is there and pre-ground coffee beans I can use and store it in an airtight container or what would be the best way to still use my espresso machine right now for the time being while I save up a bit to get a proper grinder!

Im a 31 yr male who lives at home with about 3k in savings, and drowning in CC debt.  Both my parents own a small business in North Vancouver, Canada but however they are still working their tails off.  I do have a career in paramedicine that ive been in for 3 years, work alot of hours and the cash is coming in.  

 However my money management isnt great.  This has been a problem for me since I got out of high school. I spend my money on alot of things whether its online subscriptions, amazon purchases, gym memberships, etc.  Whenever im at work i tend to buy lunch/dinner, coffees and snacks.  I do pay my parents 1k in rent every month however they thought i was saving lots of money.  Ive been lying to them that i have a alot of savings and that I should be able to put a down payment on a place sometime in the next 2 years.  

I finally confessed to them that i dont have alot in my savings and they were furious.  Rightfully so, when they have paid for my schooling, they pay for groceries and also paid off my car because they wanted me to save to buy a house for my future.  They want to sell the business soon however they think retirement isnt really an option until i have settled into my own home.  

I feel like ive let them down big time and most importantly I've let myself down by lying and also not seeking out help when i should be.  I have a solid career and making a good money every paycheck.  I also have no TFSA or RRSPs started.

For reference, I owe about 12k in my mastercard and 3k on my visa.  The accumulation of debt has been building up throughout my 20s and havent been able to get out of it since.  I spend more than i save and need to get of this hole that I've dug.  

Anyone here that has recovered from this mess or is in a similar situation like me.  Any advice would be appreciated.

For most of 2023, I was living in Peru (I'm a gringo) where I contracted 2 or 3 parasites/bacterial infections which I took antibiotics for and got rid of, and another 3 or 4 parasites/infections that I healed with plant medicines at an ayahuasca center or that went away on their own. My last 4 months in Peru were spent at the ayahuasca center, eating simply and frequently drinking plant medicines, and my gut was in excellent condition.

However, I returned to the States very underweight, because I ate only 1.5 meals a day while doing lots of physical labor. So for the past year I've been lifting weights and eating in a caloric surplus and successfully built substantial strength and muscle mass.

The hard part: for reasons I've yet to determine, I've been having multiple bowel movements a day, most of them loose and watery, for most of this past year. Minimum 3, sometimes 7 a day. Usually 2 or 3 BMs in the morning and often 1 or 2 more in the afternoon. My butt often bleeds from wiping so much. First I thought I was lactose intolerant and cut out dairy; some posts here indicated the problem might be insufficient fiber so I started taking psyllium husk. In the last month, I have quit coffee, cut down on oils, and gone vegan, expecting some combination of those to solve the problem; that's doing *something*, because I feel *generally great*, but my gut seems to be in about the same place it was before.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Should I give up on trying to solve this dietarily and see a GI doctor? Maybe I've had a bacterial infection this whole time that they can fix overnight with a pill. I just don't want to waste time and money and am looking for some guidance.

  
**Have tried**: cutting diary, increasing fiber, lots of weights and cardio, fermented foods like kimchi, vegan diet (although maybe my gut just hasn't adjusted to all the beans/legumes yet--it's been a month), quitting coffee/caffeine, less oil, more fruits and vegetables

**Haven't tried**: seeing a doctor, pharmaceutical solutions (except for Imodium a couple times), intermittent fasting / not eating after \~7pm, eating less, doing a long fast",2,1730341094.0,Biohackers,12,1.0,False

One of those times he had smiled and waved. When we matched, we had a moment where we both recognized each other. He truly seemed genuine. We went on a coffee date. Afterwards, the convo seemed to take a turn to the “dirty” side… we had sex the next time we saw each other. Afterwards, I asked him if he wanted to hang out on the weekend. He said he was always visiting family on weekends, most likely could do a Tuesday since he’s free that entire day. He texts me “Hi :)” on Friday afternoon…. I texted him back. No response from Friday and it is now Wednesday. I have never been ghosted my entire 27 years of living. Completely baffled as this guy lives right across from me. And he’s 33 years old. Seriously couldn’t just communicate? I was going back and forth between sending him a long text message. I ended up doing it to get myself closure. I sent him this: I don’t know if you’re going to see this and at this point, I really don’t care to hold my silence. I’m not sure why you just went MIA all of a sudden, but you could have had the common decency and easily communicated whatever the reason was for it. We’re both adults here. I’ll be honest — you did not strike me as the type of person who would be like this. Not expecting a response either because well, your silence speaks volumes already. Good luck in life. :)

Sorry for this big venting… I just am so angry. The sex wasn’t even good but I really wanted to get to know him as a person….",1,1730340980.0,ghosting,2,0.99,False

Hey there! Happy almost Halloween! How has your week been so far??

I am here to find a new friend! Someone to chat with throughout the day and share thoughts, travel plans, stories, or just the random things that come up in life! Always open to listen or give objective opinions if they're welcome! Or even a gym account-a-bil-a-buddy!

I am an active guy from Colorado and as my username says, have too many hobbies lol. I start every day with coffee then a workout, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, I read more than one book at a time, and have a wonderful but very stubborn doggo. I love skiing and am excited about resorts opening up here (Colorado). That usually takes priority for my activities in the winter and in the summer I enjoy hiking, kayaking, softball, recently tried out pickleball, golf, dirt biking, working on my house, going to concerts/sporting events/any kind of show really, and probably more things that I'm forgetting about.

I've also started traveling more over the last couple of years and am trying to plan my first non-US trip. I have some ideas of where I'd like to go but am always looking for advice and would love to hear your stories!",1,1730340892.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False
