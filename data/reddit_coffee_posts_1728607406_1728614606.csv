1g0zvsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1g0zvsy/bit_of_an_informative_vent_about_swerve_and_its/,Bit of an informative vent about Swerve and its Ingredients.,"^(No. This is not a post about ""that study"" from a while back.)

\_\_\_\_

This is about the:

* **Granulated Swerve:** ""Natural Flavors""
* **Brown Swerve:** Vegetable Glycerin
* **Confectioners/Powdered Swerve:** Tapioca Starch

...among the actual sweetener ingredients.

Before yesterday, it didn't cross my mind that the packages had these ingredients listed... but a day of doing a sweetener-free ""elimination diet"" (but still Keto) led to me realizing that I might actually have an issue with tapioca - after I made some hot cocoa with it, and noticed later that my face started itching. 

Lo and behold, tapioca comes from a root vegetable, which I have allergies to - thankfully not as severe as the vegetables themselves, but still an allergy. One rampant google search of cross-reaction allergies later... I looked up ""natural flavors"" and found out they can possibly be derived from coconut, while ""vegetable glycerin"" can also be made from palm or coconut.

So this entire time, me feeling ""off"" may have been because of the sweeteners I've been using - not because of the sweeteners themselves, but because of the sneaky extra ingredients. 

I'm posting this here as a bit of a warning, just in case somebody else might be having issues. 

Obligatory ""this is my personal ancedote; I am not a doctor, remember to speak to your doctor about any possible allergies"".

1g0zv95,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g0zv95/how_can_i_stop_myself_23f_from_thinking_about_my/,How can I stop myself (23F) from thinking about my boyfriend’s (27M) abusive ex girlfriend?,"This has been an issue I’ve been dealing with for a while now, and I guess I thought airing it would be a good way to cope. Obligatory apologies for formatting and rambling. 

For starters, my boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) have been together for over a year now. The context in which this happened is really quite long, and I am truly sorry for that. This is a stinker. 

Back in my last semester of college, I met a girl my age in one of my classes, who I’ll call Jane (not her real name). She was pretty quiet, but seemingly very kind, and we began hanging out after class regularly. Eventually, we began spending time at one another’s apartments for girls’ nights, etc.. This is when I met her then-boyfriend of about 2.5 years, John (also not his real name). He and I got along very well (scarily so). It was like we were cut from the same cloth, and we both understood one another. We became a trio of friends after this, and would spend time together near daily, and text multiple times a day. I’m not ashamed to say that Jane and John became two of my best friends after just a few months following our meeting. 

Anyways. I had gotten a job for after graduation pretty far from where we were living at the time. Jane was not far from completing her degree, and she and John were both looking for jobs after school ended as well. Jane ended up getting a job offer at the same place that hired me (for the exact same position, too), and John got one and the same city as well. It all seemed perfect. The city had a pretty high cost of living, and we planned to move in together (not sure if this is important, but it was them who came up with the idea. I had been living alone for two years at this point, and was happy to keep doing so). I agreed with this to save money on rent, and I had been enjoying spending time with them, so what’s the harm?

Fast forward, and I fly there to tour apartments solo. I find one that’s pretty perfect for our needs, and we sign for a June move-in. I moved up first to get the keys from the landlord and start the process of making things feel like home (like buying food and supplies, turning the utilities on, that kind of thing). Jane and John arrive two weeks after I do. We begin to plan out what furniture we need to buy, and make a plan to drive to IKEA the next weekend. 

IKEA goes well. We got home late and tired, and ate some leftovers before bed. I’m into makeup/ beauty, and was telling both John and Jane how I’d shape their eyebrows, which involved touching the space around (you guessed it) their eyebrows. This seems stupid, but I promise it’s relevant information. I went to bed pretty soon thereafter (around 12 or 1AM) and was woken up by Jane at around 4AM. She was crying and saying how she and John had a fight, and that she doesn’t want to get kicked out of the apartment (context: the lease only had spots for two names, and John offered his name alongside mine when signing). I was pretty out of it, but comforted her and said that I wouldn’t do that. She kept on talking, and I realized that she had done something to hurt John, to the point where he had locked himself in the bathroom. I comforted her more and said that she was more than her mistakes (which I recognize probably wasn’t the best thing to say at the time), and she fell asleep in my bed. I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night, and kept on thinking over and over about how Jane had hurt my friend. I texted John to see if he was okay, and he said that he was and that we’ll talk in the morning. 

Morning comes, and I’m still tired and confused. I tried my best to play mediator, and offered to take them both out for coffee or lunch to hear them out. Jane went with me first. She laid out the fight that led to John locking himself in the bathroom, which was over the fact that he didn’t bat my hand away when I touched his face out of respect to her. She called this “emotional cheating” on his part, and said that he had been engaging in this with me for months. I asked more about this, and wanted some sort of definition. She said it was a close, intimate connection with someone of the sex you’re attracted to, while also being involved romantically with someone else. Context here: Jane is queer and admitted to having a crush on me in the past when we first met. I asked her if she was also emotionally cheating with me given her previous attraction, and she said that it was different, and that this was based on “the principle” of it all. She also painted a pretty bad picture of their relationship, with him grabbing her hands or waist too tight for comfort. This whole thing lasted about two hours. 

We went back to the apartment, and John and I went out next. He was remorseful, and was steadfast in wanting to move back in with his parents. He hadn’t broken up with Jane yet, but it was obvious by the way he was speaking that that’s where it was headed. I talked him down from the “moving home” thing, and told him that I needed him. That he’s one of my best friends, and I had only just gotten to know him. He opened up more about their relationship, and painted a very different picture than Jane. He had described textbook emotional abuse. She had made him cut off all his friends and most of his family, among other things. And the fight that broke this all out? She had put her hands on him, which is why he locked himself in the bathroom. I could hardly believe it; the Jane I had known was gentle and sweet, but the one I was learning about was a monster. I initially didn’t want to take sides, but I stood with him (in secret, to help protect myself and him, of course). 

After the one-on-ones, we discussed more at home, as a group. I didn’t do much talking, but I also didn’t feel right leaving them alone (and neither asked me to go). Things went on for hours, and Jane accused John of some really heinous things. I hadn’t ever seen such desperation on either of their faces before this. 

What followed this was two weeks of hell. Jane and John were broken up, John made up his mind about staying, and Jane was digging her heels in. I was ready to call the cops and drag her out as soon as I had learned that she put her hands on him, but John told me not to, and I respected this. He told me to be patient and wait until she could stand on her own two feet. She made these two weeks the worst of my life. For example, there’s a balcony off the side of the apartment, and I would call my parents from there to update them on the situation. Jane would purposefully stand out of sight, listening to these private conversations, and then text me after the fact about how “hurt” she was that I was talking badly about her. She would create problems and things for me to apologize for without me ever realizing they were problems. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her and slowly losing my mind, and my mental health was declining rapidly. Over the course of these two weeks, I had lost about ten pounds due to stress. 

The inciting incident that made her book a ticket back home was seeing John and I gaming together in the couch. She was making dinner (which both of us offered to help her with several times), and came to the living room to hang out while waiting for something. She left the room pretty soon thereafter, and texted John: “why the fuck are you cuddling OP??”. She came into the room after this and began berating him, saying how disrespectful it was to do this to “your partner” (mind you, they had been broken up by now). This went on for ages, and I eventually stood up and told her whatever her problem was, she can take it up with me. She deflected. And after more of this screaming match with John, she grabbed her laptop and booked a plane ticket home for the next day. John had asked her to reconsider, to not be so hasty, but Jane seemed sure of it. I left the room at this point to shower and decompress. 

I had a drink (or four) afterwards, and when I saw Jane packing up, I told her I was sorry and began crying. I told her I was so sorry about the way things ended, but she and John said it wasn’t my fault. I cried in their arms for about an hour. The next morning when I woke up, she was gone and the house was empty. 

John and I had the apartment to ourselves now. There was no Jane (although she did regularly text him explicit or biting things to get his attention for a few months after this whole fiasco, but he blocked her after a mutual agreement that constant contact wasn’t good for either of them). John and I lived like normal for the next week, and went out on a Friday night to celebrate his emancipation. We both had a lot to drink, and when we got home, there were some definite… moves made. 

Fast forward to now, we’re a couple, and have been since that night. Jane is out of sight, and hasn’t been in our lives for over a year now. We love and understand each other, and I’ve been encouraging him to reach out to the people he had lost contact with during his years with Jane. He’s an incredible partner, and I love being with him. He makes me feel like a goddess, and we communicate very well. We haven’t ever had any real issues, even after dating and living together for over a year. 

This is the one problem I’ve had in my mind since getting together. I still don’t feel safe in my home, and I keep thinking about what I did back then, and how I could’ve been better. I love what John and I have, but I’m not happy with how we got it. I feel like I screwed over my best friend. They were already broken up and she was out of the house when John and I got together, but I feel so badly. What can I do to fix this feeling? Has anyone had a similar problem to this before? 

Before anyone asks: I’ve been in therapy for a few months, and it has been helping my anxiety, but that’s not enough, which is why I’m airing this now. 

TLDR: I moved in with my best friend and her boyfriend. She abused him and he broke up with her. She moved out, and he’s now dating me. I still feel guilty about it, even over a year later.

1g0zq7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g0zq7c/breakups_dont_make_logical_sense_to_me/,Breakups don’t make logical sense to me ,"Breakups do make sense to me in the way that you decide that you’d rather not stay in a romantic relationship with someone. 

However, they don’t make sense to me in the way that for most breakups, the couple goes from seeing each other so often, sometimes daily, to never really seeing each other intentionally again. 

Like if you liked someone enough to be their partner, I don’t understand how you’d go from wanting to see them so often to never wanting to see them again.

Of course, I understand if the relationship ended on bad terms. That makes sense why people wouldn’t want to see each other after that. 

But I’d imagine a lot of relationships don’t end on terrible terms. I’d think many just had different values, priorities, or had a couple of incompatibilities that were causing issues.

The way I see it, a romantic relationship is just a more intimate friendship. I understand why people would choose to not have as intimate a relationship with people they’re incompatible with. But wouldn’t they still like a lot about the person they dated (provided it wasn’t a toxic relationship and it didn’t end on bad terms)???

Like if they liked them so much they wanted to spend all that time with them, kiss them, have sex with them, etc. why not just dial back on the sex and physical intimacy, but still have a friendship with them?

I see so many of my friends upset over breakups, and part of what they have to cope with is the fact that someone they used to interact with daily is suddenly completely absent from their lives. 

It seems silly to me that people just cut each other out of their lives completely after a romantic relationship ends. It seems like they do that just because that’s what everyone does and doesn’t even take into consideration what they actually want. 

Like if it’s so painful to be apart from this person post break up, what’s the harm in still meeting up for coffee every once in a while?

The best I can figure is that people are so damn jealous and monogamous that they cannot stand to see their partner dating other people post breakup. And also that the tension from whatever issue broke them up would still be high. And also that it would be hard not to be TOO close if you kept meeting up with the person post breakup because of the romantic connection you once shared. 

A lot of divorced people who share kids still see each other and have a friendly connection still. The only difference between them and other broken up people is that they have a reason to still see each other, the kids. So it’s not unusual for them to still see each other occasionally. 

So to me, it seems like when people break up and choose to never really see each other again, they’re just doing it because that’s what everyone else does. And also it seems like nobody values friendship enough. Because if you’re friends enough to be in a relationship, why don’t you stay friends but to a lesser degree after the breakup? 

Note that I am likely autistic and have never been in a relationship. That being said, I stand behind this logic. If I enjoy being around you enough to be your partner, I’m still gonna want to be around you to an extent after we break up, as long as I didn’t actively dislike you by the time we broke up.

As I walk out to the sidewalk in front of the library, I can’t stop thinking about it all. I mean, memory manipulation? The thought of it. I know what I could do with that. I’d make a shit ton of money with that technology. Forget stealing memories, I’d charge a hell of a lot more to just change them! 

I don’t even notice the van speeding down the street at first. Too deep in my own head. I look up when I hear the screeeccchhh from the brakes, the van rocking back and forth from the jolt of the stop less than five feet in front of me on the sidewalk. My first instinct isn’t run. Nope. It’s stand there and stare at them like an idiot. I don’t really start to connect the dots until three rather large men jump out the side door, barreling right towards me with military precision. 

Oh, fuck! I’m gonna die! I start to turn around, and the big guy to my left grabs me, and next thing I know I’m on the ground face first. Something slips over my head, and now all I can see is faint light through the pores of the fabric. I can feel a sharp pain in my lower back, one of them must have their knee on me. 

“Help! Someon-” Oooff. Even though I can’t see anything, a bright flash appears. The last thing I feel before I black out is warm and wet on the back of my head, and a zip tie digging tightly into my wrists. 

The fish swim lazily in the water, gliding back and forth in that slow, hypnotic rhythm that always puts me at ease. Their colors blur together, bright scales shimmering under the blue glow of the aquarium light. I feel calm, almost peaceful, watching them drift through the water like nothing else in the world matters. I’m a kid again, nose pressed against the glass, lost in the quiet, endless dance of these creatures. 

But then, something changes. 

One of the fish, a fat orange one with bulging eyes, swims closer to the glass, closer than it should. Its mouth opens and closes, almost like it’s speaking. The sound doesn’t match up at first, like a bad dub, but then I hear it, faint at first, then louder. 

“Wake up.” 

The words echo, strange and wrong, sending a chill through me. The fish’s mouth keeps moving, and the voice grows harsher, more insistent. 

“Wake up!” 

I jerk back, startled, and the whole scene shatters like glass. The water, the fish, the warm glow of the tank—it all fractures into a blinding white light that cuts through my skull like a razor. The peaceful calm is gone, replaced by cold, harsh reality. 

My eyes snap open, and I’m staring at a tiled ceiling, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The cold, hard feeling of the chair beneath me snaps me back to the present. I’m sitting at a table in a small, sterile room, the kind that screams interrogation. My hands are zip-tied in front of me, wrists aching from the tight plastic digging into my skin. The room smells faintly of bleach, with a chill in the air that seeps right into my bones. 

I try to move, but it’s like my body’s weighed down, heavy and sluggish. I blink, trying to clear my head. There’s a guy standing over me, one of the big ones from the van. He grabs me by the collar and yanks me upright. His grip is rough, fingers digging into the back of my neck. 

“Wake up,” the guy growls, then lets go, shoving me back into the chair. The force sends a jolt of pain through my spine. 

I barely have time to catch my breath before I hear the click of heels on the cold tile. A voice, calm and composed, cuts through the fog in my head. 

“Leave us,” the voice says. 

The big guy steps back without a word, the door closing behind him with a heavy metallic thud. 

I blink, trying to focus, and see her. A woman in a sharp pantsuit, the kind that looks expensive but understated. Mid-fifties, maybe. Dark hair pulled back, lines of age etched around her eyes. She moves with the kind of confidence that comes from being the smartest person in the room—and knowing it. 

She takes a seat across from me, crossing her legs casually, like we’re about to have a polite conversation over coffee instead of whatever the hell this is. Her eyes are sharp, assessing, like she’s already made up her mind about me before I’ve said a word. 

“I have to say, you’ve made quite the mess,” she says, her voice smooth, almost pleasant. She sets a small tablet on the table, tapping it once. The screen lights up with something familiar—my memories. Flashes of my life, snippets of things I thought were mine and mine alone. They scroll by like a slideshow, each flicker sending a shock of recognition through me. 

“You’ve got some interesting memories in here,” she continues, eyes fixed on the screen. “I’ve seen most of them. Browsed through them like a photo album. We will be studying them more closely to find your motive.” She pauses, giving me a thin smile. 

I don’t say anything. My mind’s still trying to catch up, still reeling from the thought of this stranger rummaging through my head like it’s nothing. Kind of ironic, normally it’s me intruding into someone else’s mind. She leans forward, resting her elbows on the table, her expression growing serious. 

“But there’s a problem,” she says, her tone shifting. “There are gaps. Gaps you’ve tried very hard to hide. Memories that should be there but aren’t. Do you know how frustrating it is to scroll through someone’s life and find little black holes where the important parts should be?” 

I swallow, trying to mask the panic clawing up my throat. She taps the screen again, bringing up a series of blank spaces, timestamps with nothing attached to them. It’s like looking at missing pieces of a puzzle, and I know exactly what they are. 

“I want to know why,” she says, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. “What are you hiding? What did you do in those missing moments? And more importantly, what do you plan on doing with what’s in those gaps?” 

She sits back, waiting, her eyes never leaving mine. 

My head hurts bad. I cannot look directly towards the light, so I’m guessing I have a concussion. 

“Maybe if you didn’t hit me in the damn head so hard earlier, there wouldn’t be any gaps.” 

I try to shift in the chair, but the zip ties dig in deeper, cutting into my skin. My head is throbbing, and every time I blink, it feels like someone’s jabbing a needle into my brain. She’s staring at me, still as a statue, eyes locked onto mine like she’s waiting for me to crack. 

“Let’s try this again,” she says, her voice smooth as glass. “You’re not just stumbling through life, making random choices. These gaps aren’t accidents. They’re deliberate. So, why don’t you cut the crap and tell me what you’re hiding?” 

I bite back a groan, forcing a smirk. “Sure, lady, I’m hiding my grand plan to rule the world. Step one: steal memories. Step two: profit. Step three… I don’t know, maybe buy a yacht?” My head’s pounding, and my heart’s racing, but I’m not about to give her the satisfaction of seeing me squirm. 

She doesn’t rise to the bait. Her expression doesn’t even twitch. She’s good. Instead, she calmly swipes on the tablet again, and a new image pops up on the screen. I feel my stomach drop when I see it: Charlie. He’s behind the bar, wiping down glasses like he always does, looking like he couldn’t give less of a shit about the world around him. 

My mouth goes dry, and I can’t keep the flicker of panic from showing on my face. She catches it, of course, and that thin smile creeps back. “You recognize him, don’t you? Charlie… runs that sad little dive bar you like so much.” She says it like he’s a nobody, like he’s just another face in my messed-up life. But to me, he’s more than that. He’s a link to my old life, back when things made more sense. 

“What about him?” I ask, trying to sound indifferent, but my voice wavers, and she knows she’s hit a nerve. 

She takes her time, enjoying the power shift. “He’s interesting. No criminal record, keeps his head down. A man who knows how to mind his own business.” She looks up at me, her eyes narrowing. “But sometimes, the quiet ones have the most to hide. Just like you.” 

Before I can respond, she snaps her fingers, and the door swings open. The big guy from before steps back in, his heavy footsteps echoing off the cold tile. He’s got this dead-eyed look like he’d rather be anywhere else but here. Without a word, he strides over, grabs me by the back of the neck, and slams me back into the chair. 

“What the hell? Get off—” My protest dies in my throat as he jams a gag into my mouth, yanking it tight around my head. I thrash against him, but he’s got a grip like a vice, his hand digging into my shoulder, forcing me down. I’m struggling to breathe, every inhale tasting like sweat and old fabric. 

She doesn’t even blink at the commotion. “I think you’ve been playing games for too long,” she says, her tone as calm as ever. She reaches into her pocket and pulls something out. It takes me a second to recognize it, but when I do, my heart nearly stops. It’s my phone. I don’t know how they got it, but they have it, and whatever’s on it is fair game now. 

She hands it to the big guy, who grips my hair, yanking my head back so I’m forced to look up at the ceiling. He holds the phone up in front of my face, and before I can even think to close my eyes, the screen lights up, scanning my face, and unlocks. 

“Thank you,” she says, taking the phone from him like it’s nothing. I’m still struggling, still gagged, and still pinned in place. She taps on the screen, her eyes flicking up at me with that same cold, calculating look. 

I don’t know what’s worse—the feeling of complete helplessness or knowing that whatever happens next is completely out of my control. She must’ve seen Charlie when she was in my head, noticed the connection I had to him. The closest thing to a father I remember, in a messed-up way that is my life. 

The woman taps away on my phone, her expression never changing, calm and methodical like she’s going through a routine. I can’t scream through the gag, can’t do anything but watch as she pulls up Charlie’s contact. My heart’s slamming against my chest, every nerve screaming at me to do something, but the guy holding me down doesn’t give an inch. I’m stuck, forced to witness whatever fresh hell she’s about to unleash. 

She presses the call button. The ringing fills the room, each chime ratcheting up the tension. I hear a click, and then his voice, thick with that familiar Irish lilt, gruff but always warm, like he’s talking to an old friend instead of whatever nightmare this is. 

“Aye, who’s this?” Charlie says, probably wiping down the bar like he always does, end of another long day. 

The woman leans back in her chair, tapping on some small device she’s pulled out—a sleek, sinister piece of tech with a faint glow. She doesn’t waste any time. 

“Charlie,” she says, her voice switching to a sickly sweet tone that makes my skin crawl. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” 

There’s a pause. I can almost hear the confusion on the other end. “Who the feck is this?” 

She doesn’t bother answering. Instead, she messes with the device, and this high-pitched whine starts filling the room, just on the edge of hearing. It’s like feedback from a broken radio, irritating, unsettling. I can feel it buzzing in my teeth, making my whole body tense. 

“Charlie,” she says, her voice taking on this strange, almost hypnotic rhythm. “You’ve been feeling off lately, haven’t you? Angry. Sad. Like no one really understands, do they?” 

I hear Charlie’s breathing change. Slower, unsteady, like he’s struggling to focus. “What… what are you on about?” His voice is distant, foggy, like he’s not really there. 

She keeps going, her words soft but relentless, digging into him. “You’ve been carrying it all, haven’t you? That weight, that bitterness. They don’t see it, Charlie. They don’t see you. And why would they? You’re just the man behind the bar, pouring drinks, smiling when you don’t feel like it.” 

I can hear Charlie’s weak sigh, like he’s barely hanging on. “Aye... maybe...” 

“You’ve thought about it, haven’t you? Ending it all,” she says, pushing the words like they’re facts he’s known all along. “Tomorrow at 9 PM, you’re going to find a tall building, one with a nice view. You’re going to step to the edge, and you’re going to be free of it all. No one will miss you, Charlie. No one will even remember.” 

My chest tightens, rage and fear mingling as I try to fight against the guy’s grip. But I’m locked in place, forced to listen as she poisons Charlie’s mind. 

“Nine o’clock… I’ll... I’ll do it,” Charlie mumbles, his voice hollow, far away. He sounds so lost, like he’s sleepwalking through the worst moment of his life. 

The woman taps her device again, and just like that, the eerie whine cuts off. Charlie’s voice shifts back to normal, groggy and confused, like he’s waking up from a bad dream. “Who... who the hell is this? What’s goin’ on?” 

She doesn’t hesitate. “Sorry, wrong number.” And with that, she hangs up, ending the call like she didn’t just turn my friend’s mind inside out. 

I’m panting, rage burning hotter than the fear now, but all I can do is glare at her, helpless. She calmly sets my phone back on the table, almost like this was just a casual demonstration of what they can do. 

She looks at me, her smile sharp and cold. “Now, do you get it? This isn’t some game. We can put anything we want in his head. We can make him believe anything. Make him do anything.” 

The guy releases me, but it doesn’t matter. I’m too stunned, too furious to even move. They didn’t just mess with Charlie’s head—they rewrote his reality with a flick of her device. And now all I’m left with is the sickening truth that these people can do whatever they want, to anyone I care about, anytime they feel like it. 

She flicks her hand at the guy holding my shoulders down, gesturing for him to leave again. 

“What was that?” 

She looks at me like I’m nothing. Like I’m an ant compared to her. “I implanted a memory, that is all. Poor Charlie believes that he has been planning on jumping off a building at 9 PM tomorrow.” 

“Why? Why don't you just look in my head again? Why--”  

She cuts me off. “Why didn’t I use this on you?” She asks, gesturing towards me with the small device in her hand. “That’s what you really want to know, right? Because I’ve already seen your memories that you have. I need to find out about what you removed, and what your plans are next. As great as this is,” She swings the device towards me again, “it doesn't access what I’m after with you. Thoughts and ideas, sadly, I cannot read. I can implant them. I can read memories. I could implant a thought into you that you want to tell me everything. But that involves risks that I cannot afford right now. We need to know who you are working with. Who sent you to our facility, and who did you share what you took with. And implanting something in you risks the chance of wiping you completely.” 

“How the fuck do I tell you something I don’t remember? You said it was wiped from me!” 

“Yes, the memory of it was. But not the thought. You know what you would do still, even if you don’t remember it. And you have until 9 PM tomorrow to remember. Don’t wait too long, now, if you want to save poor Charlie.” 

 

Chapter 13 

I sit there, staring at the blank walls, trying to push down the rising tide of panic. The chair beneath me feels colder now, the room oppressive, and the silence is deafening. My wrists ache from the zip ties, but that’s the least of my worries. My mind keeps drifting back to Charlie. 

The way his voice changed—like it wasn’t even him anymore. That hollow tone, that lifeless ""aye,"" as if he’d already made his choice. It was her doing. I know it. She twisted him, planted the thought so deep that he believes it’s real. And now, thanks to me, he’s going to climb a building at 9 PM tomorrow and step right off the edge, thinking no one will miss him. 

This is my fault. 

I shake my head, trying to fight off the guilt, but it’s there, gnawing at me like a persistent headache. I can’t do anything—at least, not from here. I’m just sitting in this goddamn chair, waiting for whatever comes next. For all I know, they’re already doing worse to Charlie or someone else I care about. 

I want to scream, to fight back, but I’m locked down tight. My thoughts are spinning, cycling through all the ways I could’ve avoided this mess. Should’ve seen it coming. I’ve always been smart enough to dodge the worst of things. But this? This is bigger than me. I got greedy, and now Charlie’s about to pay for it. 

The door creaks open, and I stiffen. A tall, lean man steps in—different from the meathead who slammed me into the chair earlier. This guy’s more… precise. He’s got that no-nonsense look about him, dressed in a crisp suit that somehow manages to look even more out of place in this clinical setting. He doesn't speak at first, just walks over to me with the kind of calm confidence that screams ""I’m in charge here."" 

He looks down at me, his gaze cold and unfeeling, before pulling out a knife—simple, practical. Without a word, he cuts through the zip ties on my wrists, and I feel a momentary rush of relief as the plastic snaps loose. 

“Time to go,” he says, his voice flat, emotionless, as if this is just another routine transfer. He grabs my arm, yanking me out of the chair with far more force than necessary. My legs are weak, but I manage to stand. Barely. 

“Where are we going?” I ask, but he doesn’t bother answering. He just shoves me forward, guiding me toward the door. 

I stumble as he pushes me toward the door, my body still sluggish and sore from the beating, but something in me snaps. Maybe it’s the panic, the guilt about Charlie, or maybe I’m just tired of feeling powerless, but I make a split-second decision. 

I run. 

I don’t think, I just bolt. My feet hit the cold floor hard as I aim for the narrow gap between him and the door. The surprise buys me a few seconds, just enough to break free of his grip. My heart’s racing, adrenaline surging. I’m not thinking about where I’m going, just that I need to get the hell out of here. 

But I don’t make it far. 

He moves faster than I expect—much faster. Before I can even reach the door, his arm catches me around the chest, and I’m slammed down onto the cold floor, the impact knocking the breath out of me. His knee digs into my back, pinning me in place like I’m some unruly animal. I thrash, trying to get him off, but he’s stronger, and I’m running on fumes. 

“Don’t,” he growls, but then, his voice softens, just for a moment. “I’m with DM.” 

I freeze, the words hitting me like a bucket of cold water. “What?” I gasp, still struggling to breathe, the weight of him pressing down on my ribs. 

“I’m with DM,” he whispers again, his voice barely audible. “Stop fighting, or they’ll figure it out.” 

I stop squirming, my mind reeling. He loosens his grip slightly, but I can feel the tension in his body—he’s still keeping up the act. For all anyone else watching might see, this looks like just another takedown. But now, there’s a flicker of hope. If he’s telling the truth, if DM somehow got to him… 

The man eases off, lifting me to my feet, his hand gripping my arm in a way that still feels forceful enough to keep up appearances, but different now—controlled. “Play along,” he murmurs under his breath, guiding me back toward the door. 

I don’t know if I can trust him, but right now, I don’t have much of a choice. 

The agent grabs my arm hard, yanking me forward with enough force to make the act convincing. Every step feels rough, like he’s pushing me into place, all while muttering things like, “Keep moving,” and “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.” It’s a good performance—almost too good. 

I’m not sure if I can trust him. I mean, he says he’s with DM, but what if this is all just part of some bigger game Archon’s playing? She said she wanted info from me she couldn’t get. What if this is how she plans on it? See where I go or who I contact. Bitch probably put a tracker or something on me while I was out. I keep my eyes forward, but every instinct is screaming at me to run. Still, I don’t have any other choice. If I try anything now, I’ll be dead before I even reach the door. 

We pass through a few secure checkpoints. Guards nod at the agent, not even giving me a second look. I can’t tell if that’s a good sign or a bad one. Either way, I keep my mouth shut and move with the rough nudges, keeping up the act. 

I have no clue what I’m supposed to do here. I look back at the man prodding me down the hall, and he just mouths Move at me before giving me another shove in the back. 

“Where are you taking him?” The voice booms with authority from behind us. I turn around and see the gorilla from earlier when I was being interrogated. This guy is jacked, his hair is cut in a short and neat crewcut, his ears sticking out far off the sides. Former military for sure, like a tennis ball with ears. 

“Taking prisoner into safe room four under direct orders from Dr. Scarbot, sir.” My current captor voice is still steady, like it's just another day in the office. 

“He was perfectly secure right where he was. Let me radio and see about that. Don’t fucking move.” He pulls a small handheld from his back pocket, and right as he presses in the transmit button and starts moving his hand towards his mouth, all hell breaks loose. 

Weee OOO Weee OOO. The alarms blare deafeningly in my ears, as the surrounding lights all go out in the corridor and turn to flashing red and yellow. 

“What the fuck is going on, over!?” Gorilla man shouts into the radio. 

“Sir, there has been a breach of security in the data room.” a voice on the other end responds. 

“Shit. You,” pointing at the DM’s inside guy, “get that prisoner secure. NOW!” 

“Yes, sir!” 

“Let’s go!” He grabs me, pulling me faster down the hallway as Gorilla disappears in the opposite direction. As we turn another corner, he looks around to be sure nobody is watching. 

He pulls me to a door with a flashing red bulb above it. “Listen to me, we don’t have long before they catch us. When I open this door, do not stop. If we get separated or I become compromised, just keep going. Put these on.” He tosses me a uniform similar to what he’s wearing. 

I watch him as I throw the uniform over my clothes as he pulls out a few small tools from his pocket. After almost a minute fumbling with trying to unscrew the metal push bar on the door, he starts mumbling to himself. “Fuck this” I hear, and “Stupid fucking lock.” My best guess is the doors lock with the alarm, that’s what he is trying to do. Unlock the exit. All of a sudden, he stands up, walks over to a nearby fire extinguisher, and comes running back over with it above his head like a crazy man. Right fucking towards me! 

I drop out of the way, throwing my hands up to protect my face from any more damage this week. But, instead of my face, he goes for the panic bar on the door. It breaks, hanging off by one last remaining bolt. Inside is four wires, and he grabs all of them and cuts them with one of the tools he brought. He starts rubbing the exposed ends together until they short out the lock, with much less sparks than I would have imagined. Them, he just pushes the door open. 

As we walk towards the road, I keep glancing around, expecting to be surrounded by security or something. But it’s all clear. Either this place has horrible security protocols, I am just lucky (which I know it isn’t that), or this is a set-up. Way too easy. When we get to the sidewalk, he starts to turn left. As soon as he does, I take off sprinting to the right. 

“Shit, STOP!” I can hear him yell behind me. Then I hear tires screeching, and a second later a blue minivan is driving to my side. Right as I’m about to change direction, the sliding door opens and I see DM kneeling in the van, gesturing for me. 

“Come on, idiot, let's go.” He says frantically to me. So, like a kid being offered a Reese's from a stranger, I get in the van. 

 

Chapter 14 

 

“What the HELL!”  

“What happened in there?” DM ignores my shout, looking to the guy who helped me escape. 

“Connor was about to make us, so I set off the device early. It worked, man. I think it really worked!” He replied. 

“Who the FUCK is this?” I yell at DM, gesturing my hands toward the stranger. 

DM still ignores me for a minute, continuing talking to him. “I’d say it worked. You should have seen everyone freaking out and running inside.” Finally, looking at me, “Dude, this is Menah, he’s a Dragonborn Paladin. And we have to get somewhere safe and discus what just happened. You all good?” 

“Yeah, man. I’m g--” suddenly, I remember about Charlie. “Shit man. My friend, he’s gonna kill himself tomorrow at nine. We have to get him!” 

“It’s not safe right now. We have time.” Denah answers. 

“How do you know he’s going to kill himself? Did they implant it or something?” DM asks. 

Looking at Menah, I start to question. “DM, who the fuck is this guy and why did one of them help us?” 

“I told you, he’s cool. We game together. He was my guy from the home you broke into. When we found out he was getting transferred, we planned this. You helped plan this. Trust me. Or don’t, just look for yourself.” DM tosses back a bag onto my lap. I open it, and inside is a device I recognize from DM’s basement that is a sleeker version of the memory snatcher he made for me. “Don’t view them, implant them. It will be a lot faster.” 

I hate implanting memories in myself. If I view them, I at least have the memory of viewing them, which is usually good enough. But an actual implant, it’s like a surge of feelings and shit, and it’s exhausting. Kinda like learning a language in five seconds. But I put on the device anyways. This is not gonna be fun. 

The moment it hit, it was like a dam bursting inside my mind. A surge of images, sounds, and emotions rushed in all at once, crowding out the present. One second I was myself—aware of what was around me, the steady thrum of my own heartbeat—and the next, I was drowning in memories that didn’t belong to me, yet felt as real as my own skin. 

Scenes flashed in rapid succession, too fast to catch and yet somehow crystal clear, like flickers of light behind closed eyes.  

It left a throbbing ache behind my eyes, like my brain was swelling to accommodate the new weight. I struggled to sort through the tangle of what I remembered and what was implanted, tying to blend them to understand what was happening. 

Holy shit. This is kinda like that movie from when I was young. The one where in the end, he finds out he is actually a ghost the whole time. I didn’t expect it, but once you know all the pieces fall together and you’re left like “Yeah, I knew it all along.”. That’s what this feels like. Well, except the pounding headache from having all that just dumped into my head. 

DM glances back at me, and must have noticed how uncomfortable I was. “Here man, take these.” He hands me back a bottle of off brand aspirin and a Red Bull. 

“Thanks,” as I grab them, I look over to Menah. Who was a stranger I really didn’t know a moment ago, now I recognize. We met in DM’s basement. He was the guy DM knew in the so-called nursing home, his inside man. 

I’m still trying to grasp these new memories, trying to make sense of them. “So, we planned all this bullshit?” 

“Yup. Sure did.” Menah responded. He turns the van sharply into an alley and parks behind a dumpster. 

“Let’s split up. Menah, don’t forget where to meet me.” DM says, then turns back to me. “You, drive me home. I borrowed Mom’s car.”  

As we were heading back to DM’s house, we didn’t speak much. I sat there just processing. Before the implant, I remember meeting DM at the library, then walking out and getting snatched by the meatheads. But in reality, it wasn’t even the same day. When they snatched me, I was just sitting in there by myself. Before the implant, I had forgotten about even telling DM about any of this. Not so much forgotten, as removed. 

Now I remember. Breaking into the nursing home place. Macing the patient. Macing the...oh shit. The other person I pepper sprayed. It was Menah. Well, that explains why he was so rough with me getting me out of the facility. And the papers I took. I didn’t know until a day ago, but he was on his way to make copies to share with DM. Had I known at the time, that would have saved me a lot of trouble.

We've got David Goffin, the Belgian underdog who just pulled a rabbit out of the hat by defeating Alexander Zverev, going up against the American powerhouse Taylor Fritz, who seems to be on a mission to collect wins like they're Pokémon cards.

Let's talk odds. Goffin is priced at a juicy 5.5, while Fritz is the heavy favorite at 1.15. Now, if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for underdog stories, Goffin's odds are tempting enough to make even the most cautious bettor consider a small wager. After all, he's riding high on confidence, having just toppled a top-10 player for the first time in two years.

However, let's not forget that Fritz has been as consistent as your morning coffee, boasting a 48-19 record this season and a 17-8 record on hard courts. His serve is more reliable than a Swiss watch, winning 87.3% of service games. Meanwhile, Goffin's return game is his secret weapon, with a 31.4% success rate. So, if Goffin can channel his inner Houdini and pull off another upset, it could be a match for the ages.

For the best bet, consider the over 21.5 games at 1.96. Given Goffin's recent form and Fritz's consistency, this match could easily stretch to three sets, giving you more bang for your buck. So, sit back, relax, and may the best racquet win!",1,1728613699.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

“*Make a wish, birthday boy!”* 

*“Come on, blow ‘em out.”* 

*Warm and fuzzy feelings bubble up inside me. My mom, dad, and brother, all wearing goofy party hats, urge me to blow out the candles. Grandma flashes a half-toothless smile, while Grandpa sits with his arms crossed, waiting to get back to his football game. A lot of smiling faces, all aimed directly at me.* 

Man, that was nice. Too bad it wasn’t mine. I took this memory from some hairy fuck who owed me some money. It was either this, or show everyone some pictures he didn’t know were taken of him. Frankly, I doubt it was his memory either. If it was, something must’ve gone horribly wrong in his life for him to end up the way he did. People like him tend to sell off all their original memories. 

I did. I don’t even remember why. Maybe I hated my parents. Maybe I had a happy childhood. Hell, I don’t even know if I had parents. The funny thing is, you don’t miss what you don’t remember. We live in a society built on this. Back when I was a kid—12, maybe 13—some genius figured out how to upload memories. Kind of like a cloud, except instead of storing useless photos of your lunch, you could save your first kiss, the birth of your kid, or even your wedding day. 

It started out innocent enough. Dying grandmothers shared memories of holding their children for the first time. People with early Alzheimer’s could save their memories so they wouldn’t lose them forever. You could even dig up forgotten moments, like your first taste of spaghetti. Nostalgic gold. 

But then it went south. Authorities began using it to bypass unreliable witness statements. Suspects had their memories ripped out to ""see what really happened."" Say you told the cops you were at your grandma’s at 6 PM on the 14th—why, then, does the recording show you punching a hooker in the face? 

That was just the beginning. Hackers had a field day. Politicians were their favorite targets. I still remember when the Governor of Alabama’s private memory got leaked—the one where he was screwing the pool boy. Guess he didn’t trust himself to keep it in his head, or maybe he just liked to rewatch it for kicks. That was the first big scandal, and once that memory hit the net, the whole system popped like an overfilled balloon. 

Of course, the whole thing became a moral battleground. Some people abused it—because, of course, they did. Instead of being a tool to help, it became another weapon. Eventually, the government cracked down and banned it altogether. 

But I’m not complaining. When something goes underground, it just becomes more profitable. That’s where I come in. The tech isn’t easy to get. But I know a guy. It’s basically like one of those virtual reality goggles from the ‘90s, with chunky graphics and a single bad game preloaded. My guy made my set in his mom’s basement. Undetectable. Untraceable. No cloud or internet, just a little flash drive. 

I like to think of myself as a sort of Robin Hood of memories. Well, maybe not. I don’t exactly give to the poor—I sell them. There’s a thriving market for good memories, and even for bad ones in some twisted circles. I have a whole operation where I take what I want from people who deserve it—or at least people I don’t like—and flip those memories for a damn good profit. 

I don’t just target anyone, though. I mean, I have no moral compass that says don’t hurt good people—it's just easier to go after the scummier folks. Drug addicts used to be easy, but most of them have already sold off anything worth taking. What’s left in their heads isn’t exactly premium material—think jerking off behind a grocery store. So lately, I’ve been using Georgette. She’s a hooker I met at a party. Not the prettiest, but she passes for 14, which says a lot about the guys who hire her. I figure if they’re into that, they deserve what’s coming. 

When I need fresh memories, I give her a call. She slips them a roofie, I take what I want, and they wake up none the wiser. They just assume they partied too hard and blacked out. Georgette keeps whatever they paid her, plus an extra $50 from me. 

It’s a solid setup. You could say it’s just business, but it’s more than that. In a world where memories are currency, you learn fast that the line between what’s yours and what isn’t is as blurry as a half-forgotten dream. 

 

Chapter 2 

“GIVE ME BACK WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU TOOK, YOU FUCK!” 

OOOFFFFF. I can feel the air suck right out of me. This guy hits hard. Real hard. I try to wrestle away and get another shot right to the gut for my trouble. 

“Listen, you little bitch. I know you and that other cunt were in my head! I got home this morning, took one look at my wedding photo, and realized—shit, I don’t remember that day at all! My daughters’ births? Their first words? Gone! Yesterday was my anniversary, man. Now I don’t even remember getting married! And I know I remembered all that before I met your little slut.” 

Desperation mixed with pure rage flickers in his eyes as he shouts. I can feel his breath—hot, sticky, and rancid—burning my face. I don’t have time for this. So, I do what any self-respecting scumbag would do: I headbutt him. A perfect shot, right in the bridge of his nose. 

I regret it immediately. My legs buckle under me as pain explodes in my skull. When my vision clears, I see him grinning through a bloody mess. They were right—nobody wins with a headbutt. At least I didn’t this time. 

“You fuck. Now you’re gonna get it!” 

He goes for a stomp to my face, but I roll out of the way, scrambling under the barstools like a rat. The place is packed tonight, and I’m ducking and dodging through legs as he keeps swinging. As I crawl, my palms slide on something slick and revolting. 

“Damn it, Charlie! Mop the fucking floor once in a while!” I shout, mostly to distract from the fact that I’m in serious trouble. 

I barely roll out of the way as his boot comes crashing down. The smell of stale beer and sweat mixes with something far worse clinging to the floor. I dodge another kick, more concerned about avoiding the suspicious wet spot than the crazy bastard trying to rearrange my face. 

Where the hell is—there! I spot Charlie by the end of the bar, polishing a glass, looking about as interested as a man watching paint dry. The old Irish grump isn't big, but built like a sack of bricks, five-foot-eight, two hundred pounds of lumpiness that’s equal parts stubborn muscle and bad attitude. He doesn’t take shit from anyone, and I’ve seen guys twice his size rethink their life choices when they cross him. 

I make a break for it, crashing into a table as I do. Charlie finally looks up, eyes narrowing. “Jesus Christ,” he mutters under his breath. The crazy bastard is still after me, but when he sees Charlie, he hesitates. That’s all the opening Charlie needs. 

“Oi, enough of that shite!” Charlie’s voice booms across the bar like a cannon. He steps between us, glass still in hand. “You touch him again, and I’ll shove that boot so far up yer arse you’ll be tasting leather for a week.” 

The guy freezes. He’s not scared of me, but Charlie’s another story. No one messes with Charlie in his own bar. The guy stands there, chest heaving, nostrils flaring, torn between fighting and backing down. Finally, he spits on the floor—narrowly missing Charlie’s boot—and storms out, muttering curses under his breath. 

Once he’s gone, the tension in the room deflates. Charlie turns his glare on me. I’ve seen that look before. He’s definitely not happy with me right now. 

“Get up, ya gobshite,” Charlie growls, grabbing me by the collar and hauling me to my feet. “You’re lucky he didn’t cave your skull in. What the hell are you playin’ at, causin’ trouble in my place?” 

I rub the back of my neck, still wincing from the headbutt. “It wasn’t me, Charlie. He—” 

Charlie cuts me off with a snort. “I don’t give a rat’s arse who started it. You think I don’t know what you get up to? You’re bringing your dirty work into my bar, and I won’t have it!” 

He lets go of my collar and jabs a finger in my face. “Keep your mess outta my place, or next time I’ll let them break whatever’s left of that thick skull o’ yours.” 

I nod, swallowing my pride. Charlie’s grumpy, but he’s also fair. If he didn’t step in, that guy would’ve pounded me into the floor. 

“Yeah, yeah, I hear you,” I mumble. “I’ll keep clean here.” 

Charlie just shakes his head and goes back to polishing his glass. “See that you do, or you’ll find yourself on the wrong end of my patience.” 

I straighten up and glance toward the door. The guy’s gone, but I know it’s not over. He’ll be back, and next time he won’t be alone. But that’s a problem for later. For now, I’m just grateful to still have all my teeth. 

As I slip out of the bar, I can still feel Charlie’s eyes on me. I’ll have to lay low for a bit—let things cool off. But deep down, I know I’ll be back. I always come back. 

 

Chapter 3 

The streets are slick with rain, reflecting the neon glow from busted streetlights. It’s the kind of night where most people walk with their heads down, lost in thought, sifting through their memories like a stack of old photos. But not me. Can’t sift through what you don’t have. All my childhood memories are long gone, traded or taken. 

Except for one. 

I don’t know why I kept it. Hell, I don’t even know what it really is. All I know is, it’s the only memory that doesn’t feel like it’s wrapped in barbed wire. It’s simple—a kid staring at fish in one of those giant aquariums with the glass walls. I think it’s me, but who the fuck knows anymore. The memory’s like looking through a foggy window: hazy, warm, peaceful. The fish glide by, back and forth, not a care in the world. They’re just there, floating in silence, like nothing else matters. I’m zoning out, lost in it. 

SMACK! 

Something slams into my back, and my heart damn near jumps out of my chest. I whirl around, fists clenched, ready to swing— 

—and there’s Denny, laughing his ass off. 

“You should see your face, man! Looked like you saw a ghost!” He’s grinning like the idiot he is, scruffy beard and wild eyes like he just crawled out of a dumpster. And, knowing Denny, he probably did. 

“Jesus, Denny! What the fuck’s wrong with you?” I snap, rubbing my chest where he hit me. “You trying to get your teeth knocked out?” 

He’s still grinning, not a care in the world. “Aw, come on. You were practically drooling. You looked like you were miles away. I just brought you back to Earth.” 

I let out a breath and shake my head, trying to settle my nerves. “Yeah, well, Earth sucks. I was better off where I was.” 

Denny shrugs. “Must’ve been some damn good daydream, then. I don’t usually see you all starry-eyed. What’s going on in that thick skull of yours?” 

I think about telling him about the aquarium memory, but what’s the point? Denny wouldn’t get it. In fact, he’d probably laugh at me. He’s the type who lives minute-to-minute, always scheming, always chasing his next hustle. So, I just brush him off. “Nothing. Just thinking about stuff.” 

“‘Stuff’? Real specific there, buddy,” Denny says with a chuckle. He’s always pushing, always needling, but he knows when to back off. “Well, whatever it is, forget it. I know a spot where we can get a drink and maybe find some trouble to get into.” 

I shoot him a sideways glance. “Not in the mood, Denny. I just crawled off a bar floor, and I’m not in the mood for another round of ‘who wants to kill me tonight.’” 

Denny nods like he’s taking it seriously, but I can see the gears turning in his head. He lives for the dives, for the mess, for the chaos. “Alright, alright. I’ll keep it classy. Promise.” He crosses his heart, like that means a damn thing. 

As we walk, he starts rambling about his latest scam—something involving fake IDs and rigged gambling machines. I let him talk, half-listening. My mind keeps drifting back to that aquarium memory. I’ve seen it a hundred times, but I still don’t know why it sticks with me. There’s nothing special about it—no faces, no voices, just fish gliding in and out of view. But it’s mine, one of the last scraps of my real life that I haven’t sold off or buried. 

“Yo! You listening?” Denny snaps his fingers in front of my face, breaking me out of my thoughts. “I said we’re here.” 

We stop in front of a place that’s not quite a dive but not quite respectable either. Neon lights buzz over the door, flickering like they can’t decide whether to give up or keep going. The sign reads “The Glass Tank.” Fitting, I guess. The irony isn’t lost on me, but I don’t mention it. 

“After you, daydreamer,” Denny says with a smirk, pushing open the door. 

The inside is dim, smoky, with that mix of cheap booze and stale air that every bar in this part of town seems to have. It’s not packed, but there are enough people around to blend in without standing out. That’s the kind of place I like. 

We slide into a booth, and Denny orders us a couple of drinks. He’s already scanning the room, eyes darting from person to person, like he’s measuring them up for his next scam. I try to let the noise and the warmth of the bar drown out the thoughts gnawing at the back of my mind. But that memory—those damn fish—won’t let go. It’s like they’re still floating somewhere in the back of my head, calm and silent while the rest of me spirals. 

“Hey, Earth to loser,” Denny says, snapping me out of it again. “I swear, man, you’re losing it.” 

“Maybe,” I mutter, downing my drink. “But at least I got something left to lose.” 

Denny raises his glass with a grin. “To losing what little we’ve got left!” 

I clink my glass against his, trying to push that aquarium memory back down where it belongs. But it lingers, soft and blurry, like the last bit of light before the darkness swallows everything whole. 

 

Chapter 4 

I wake up in a room that smells like sweat and stale cigarettes. My head feels like it’s been smashed with a brick, and I have no clue how I got here. Last thing I remember is grabbing drinks with Denny—after that, nothing. Just a black hole where the night should be. 

I sit up, rubbing my temples, trying to force something out of my foggy brain, but it’s like hitting a brick wall. Nothing. Not even flashes. That’s not normal. I’ve been blacked out before, but this? This is different. It’s like someone reached in and scooped out part of my memory. 

I grab my phone and call Denny. He always answers. Always. But it just rings and rings until voicemail picks up. “Hey, this is Denny! Leave a—” I hang up before he can finish. Something’s off. 

I throw on my jacket and head out. First stop is the usual spots—places where Denny practically lives. But he’s not hustling drunks at the pool hall. Not chatting up the waitresses at that greasy diner. Not even posted up outside the corner store selling fake IDs to teenagers. 

As the sun starts dipping, I’m getting that gnawing feeling in my gut that I don’t like. I’m used to hunting people down for memory jobs, not chasing after my own friend. This is too close to home. 

It’s getting dark by the time I find him. He’s sitting on a bench near the park, just staring off into space. Relief hits me for half a second, but it’s quickly drowned by something else. Something cold. Denny doesn’t look right. He’s too still, too calm. Not twitchy, not checking his surroundings like he’s always doing. Something’s wrong. 

I walk up slow, hands in my pockets. “Denny. Hey.” 

He barely turns his head, eyes glazed over. “Yeah?” 

My chest tightens. That single word hits me like a punch. Flat. Empty. Not Denny. I know what this is. I’ve seen that look too many times. Hell, I’ve put that look on people myself. He’s been wiped. 

But this wasn’t some quick grab like I usually do. This is deep. Like someone wanted him scrubbed clean. 

“Denny, it’s me,” I say, trying to keep my voice steady. “You don’t remember last night?” 

He just stares, blinking slow like it’s taking all his effort to process what I’m saying. “Sorry, man. I don’t know you.” 

And there it is. Whoever did this really did a number on him. I’m not shocked, not really. More pissed. Not just because Denny’s gone, but because whoever did this went deep enough to erase me from his head entirely. 

“Who did this to you?” I mutter under my breath, knowing he doesn’t have the answer. But still, I can’t help it. I’m running through my mental list of suspects, thinking about who’d want to do this to him, or worse, who’d want to send me a message. 

Denny gets up, dusts off his pants like he’s ready to move on. “Look, I gotta get going. If you need something, I can’t help you.” 

I watch him walk away like I’m nothing more than a stranger asking for change. It’s a knife twist, but I push it down. I’ve been around too long to get sentimental. Still, as he disappears into the dark, I know this isn’t over. Whoever wiped Denny and took whatever they took from me wants to play, and I’ve got no choice but to play along. But I’m not some tough guy. I’ll pick my fights when they make sense and back off when they don’t. 

Right now, though? I don’t know which one this is. 

I light a cigarette and stand there for a while, letting the smoke curl up into the night sky. I’m not about to go charging in guns blazing. That’s a quick way to end up in a ditch. First, I need information. And I need it fast, before Denny’s trail goes cold. 

I take one last drag, flick the butt to the ground, and head off into the night. Someone has to have a memory of us last night. If they don’t talk—well, I have my ways. 

 

Chapter 5 

I. Need. Fucking. Coffee. 

I feel like shit. Between getting my ass handed to me, partying too hard, losing chunks of my memory, and spending a whole day chasing after Denny, I’m running on fumes. And fuck—I almost forgot about that prick who tried to stomp my head in at Charlie’s. If he’s the one behind all this, he’s a goddamn idiot. Should’ve wiped the memory of him too if he had any brains. 

I drag myself out of bed, every muscle aching. I should track down Georgette, see if that psycho went after her too. I can’t afford to sit on this. I need to stay hot on the trail, get back whatever the hell he took from me and Denny. 

But first—coffee. A cup of the blackest, strongest sludge I can find. 

I yawn, glancing at the clock. Eleven in the morning. On my schedule, that’s like waking up at 4 AM for a normal human being. Too damn early for this shit. 

I throw on some clothes and head out, the city’s noise hitting me like a wall as soon as I step outside. The air’s thick with exhaust and the smell of burnt food from a street vendor nearby. Normally, I wouldn’t even notice, but today, something feels off. It’s like the city’s got eyes—hundreds of them—all on me. 

As I walk, I can’t shake the feeling. It’s crawling up my spine, making my skin itch. I glance over my shoulder, but there’s no one there. Still, I can’t get rid of this gnawing sense that I’m being watched. It’s like everyone on the street is staring at me, even though they’re not. Paranoia’s a bitch, but I’ve learned not to ignore it. 

Lost in my thoughts, I don’t notice the bum until I’m practically on top of him. We collide, and he stumbles, cursing as he goes down. 

“Watch where you’re fucking going, you idiot!” he slurs, waving a half-empty bottle in my direction. 

“Sorry, man,” I mumble, but I’m already backing away, the anxiety turning into full-blown panic. I need to move. Now. 

I take off down the street, half-jogging, half-running, trying to shake the feeling that something’s closing in on me. My heart’s pounding, and it’s not just from the run. I can’t remember the last time I felt this rattled. 

When I finally slow down, I’m standing in front of Georgette’s building. My breath catches in my throat. As I walk into the brick building, I head down the hallway towards her place. There’s yellow police tape crisscrossed over her apartment door, the kind that screams “Keep Out.” My stomach drops. 

A neighbor walks by, sweating like a pig even with the AC running in this place, and I catch her arm. “What happened here?” 

She glances at my hand on her arm, then at my face. “You didn’t hear? Georgette…she killed herself two nights ago. Left a note and everything.” She spit out as she wrenched her arm from my grip. 

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. I stand there, numb, trying to process it. Two nights ago? That’s when everything went to shit. 

I just stand there, staring at the tape, shock and disbelief twisting into a cold, hard knot in my gut. This wasn’t an accident. I know it wasn’t. But if someone wiped Denny and Georgette’s gone, then what the hell am I dealing with? 

 

Chapter 6 

I have to find that fucking guy from the other night. Georgette usually keeps “souvenirs” of the guys we hustle. A watch, a wallet, maybe a credit card. I mean, it’s not like they even remember they ever owned it. And if they do, what are they gonna do, call the cops? 

I peek down the hallway. It’s empty, nobody in sight. Good. I move quickly to Georgette’s door, the yellow police tape crisscrossed over it like a sick joke. The tape’s meant to keep people out, but let’s be real—this isn’t exactly a high-security setup. 

I peel back the tape, just enough to slip inside without drawing attention, and push the door open. The apartment’s nice, surprisingly so. Clean, everything in order. Business must’ve been good for her. Figures. While I’m out here getting my face smashed in, Georgette’s been living it up. 

The place feels almost too normal, which makes it worse somehow. I start searching, checking the usual spots: drawers, under the mattress. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just the regular clutter of someone who’s careful but not paranoid. I move into the bathroom, and that’s where the reality hits. 

There’s blood spatter by the tub with those little yellow evidence things next to it, and a trail of it going up the side of the bath. Inside the bath is a pinkish stain about three quarters up the bath, right to where the water level must’ve been. They must not have sent their cleaning crew yet. Shit. Must’ve been slit wrists in the bath. I didn’t need to see this. The air feels thicker in here, heavy with the stench of something final. Did Georgette actually do this to herself, or did someone else decide to close the book on her? 

My mind’s racing, trying to piece together what the fuck actually happened. But before I get too lost in the grim scene, something catches my eye—one of those old-school vents near the floor, the kind where the cover pulls out. Exactly the type of spot someone might stash something they don’t want found. 

I pull off the cover, and sure enough, there’s a stash inside. A couple of small baggies of what looks like coke, a few thousand bucks in small bills—fives, tens, twenties—plus a stack of IDs and credit cards. No shit. Georgette was better at this than I thought. She even took the licenses, probably to use the billing addresses for online shopping sprees. Smart girl. 

I pocket the drugs and the cash—might need that later—and start sifting through the cards. Most of them are forgettable, just random schmucks who crossed paths with us and we took some memories they probably won’t even realize they’re missing. But then I find it. The ID of the big guy from the other night. The one who tried to turn my face into a pancake. 

Bingo. Now we’re getting somewhere. 

I stand there for a moment, card in hand, staring at his face. The guy looks like a meathead even in his photo, all grimace and no brains. But this isn’t just about revenge. If he’s tied up in this, if he’s the one who wiped Denny and maybe even had something to do with Georgette’s death, then I need to find him. And fast. 

But for now, I slip the ID into my pocket, my mind already running through the next steps. Whatever happened, whatever the hell this is turning into, it’s not gonna be pretty. But at least I’ve got a lead. 

Now it’s time to see where it takes me. 

 

Chapter 7 

I rush to the small storage unit where I keep my stash, half in a daze but forcing myself to stay sharp. I can’t afford to be sloppy—not with everything that’s been going on. So I go through the motions, like muscle memory, using the misdirection tactics I’ve relied on for years. I stop to check if anyone’s following me, take a few wrong turns, double back. Finally, I reach my destination—a shitty indoor storage facility that’s as rundown as it is anonymous. 

I slam through the door and race down the dimly lit corridor to my unit. The metal door creaks as I roll it up, revealing my barebones setup inside. A cheap fold-up table, a battered chair, the memory glasses, and a few flash drives—the ones I haven’t sold yet. David’s memories from the other night are still on the glasses, waiting for me to sift through them and find buyers. 

I set up quickly, my fingers twitching with a mix of frustration and urgency. I need answers, and I need them now. Maybe there’s something in David’s memories that’ll point me in the right direction, something that’ll explain why everything’s gone to shit. 

I slide on the glasses and start diving into the memories. It’s the usual sentimental crap—family dinners, date nights, and playing catch with one of his daughters in the backyard. The kind of memories that sell well on the black market because they make shitty people feel better about themselves, like they were the ones with the good life. But there’s nothing here that gives me any real answers, nothing that connects him to what’s been happening to me, Denny, or Georgette. Just more of the same boring, suburban shit. 

Fuck. Wasted time. I could’ve been out there, tracking down the real threat, but instead, I got sidetracked by this guy. I can’t stop, I have to keep moving. This prick took it too far. 

I pocket the glasses and the flash drives, then head out of the storage unit, locking it up behind me. My next stop is David’s house, and I’m not leaving until I get some answers. 

This asshole’s house is exactly what I imagined from a guy like him. Big, nice, and flashy.  There’s a shiny SUV parked in the driveway. A family car, no doubt. The whole setup screams suburban bliss, but I know better. Beneath all this polish is a guy who gets his kicks by doing things that would make his neighbors' skin crawl. 

I feel myself getting more and more pissed as I soak it all in, and I can hardly contain it as I walk up to this asshole’s door.  I reach out to ring the doorbell, but before I can, the door swings open. 

David’s there, stepping out with a smile on his face, muttering a casual goodbye to someone inside. But when he turns and sees me standing there, his expression changes in an instant. The smile drops, replaced by a look of surprise that quickly turns into anger. 

“David,” I say, voice low and cold, as I cock my fist back to hit him. 

But he’s faster. His fist connects with my jaw before I even see it coming. Pop! The world spins, and pain explodes through my head as I crumple to the ground. Damn, he’s fast. And hits harder than I probably do too. Everything goes black, but not before I feel him grabbing me, dragging me across the rough pavement towards his car. 

I come to in the passenger seat, my head pounding like a drum. The seatbelt is wrapped around me a few times and buckled in, not tight enough to trap me but snug enough that David’s got the upper hand if I try something. My vision’s still blurry, but I can hear him muttering angrily as he drives. 

“This is bullshit,” he growls, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. “Now they’re showing up at my fucking home? My home?” He notices me stirring and glances over, his eyes narrowing. 

Screeeeech! He slams on the brakes, and my body jumps forward, the seatbelt snapping tight across my chest. My head whips forward, then back, the belt locking up as it digs into my shoulder. Fuck man, I can’t catch a break. 

Lurch reaches for me. I try to throw my hand up, but I can only move from my elbows down. “Whoa whoa whoa! Wait a fucking second!” Man, I sound like a bitch. But I need to get my wits back, so whatever works I guess. 

He hesitates, his breath coming in harsh, angry bursts, but he doesn’t hit me again. Instead, he glares at me, his eyes full of paranoia and rage. “You think you can just show up at my house? Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea what I could do to you?” 

“Yeah, I get it,” I say, trying to stay calm despite the pain in my head. “Big guy, nice house, little dick. You’ve got it all, right? I just need to know what the hell happened the other night.” 

His expression darkens further, and his grip tightens on the wheel. “The other night? You mean when you and that bitch got in my head?” His voice is low and dangerous. “You think I’m stupid? You think I don’t know what you did?” 

I raise an eyebrow, playing along. “What do you think is happening now?” 

He leans in closer, his face inches from mine, his eyes wild with suspicion. “You and that Irish prick? You’re in on it together, trying to take me out. Make me disappear. I know how this works.” 

I blink, genuinely confused. “What the hell are you talking about?” 

“Don’t bullshit me!” he snaps, veins bulging in his neck. “You think I don’t know what’s going on? You’re here to finish the job, but you fucked up. You showed up at my house!” 

“Look, man,” I say, trying to defuse the situation. “I’m not here to finish anything. I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on. Denny’s been wiped, Georgette’s dead, and now you’re acting like I’m part of some hit squad.” 

“Denny?  Who’s dead??” David’s confusion is genuine, and I start to see the cracks in his tough-guy facade. He doesn’t know who Denny is. I’m starting to believe he’s not involved in this. He’s just another paranoid asshole caught up in something bigger than he understands. 

“Did you kill her?” 

His grip on the wheel loosens slightly, and he leans back, the fight draining out of him. “You’re not here to take me out? I didn’t kill anyone. I just want my shit back. I DIDN’T KILL ANYONE!!” He almost sounds like a wild animal at the end, half yell, half wail. 

For a moment, the car is silent, just the sound of our breathing filling the space. David’s still on edge, but the realization is starting to sink in—he’s not the target, just another dumbass. 

“So… what now?” he finally asks, his voice low and uncertain. 

“Now?” I consider my next move. “Get me the fuck out of this car and you’ll never see me again.” 

David hesitates, but then he nods slowly, shifting the car back into park finally. He unclicks my seatbelt, and I awkwardly unravel myself. Before I open the door, I reach into my pocket and pull out the flash drive and the stack of cards. “Here,” I say, handing the copy I made over. “Your shit. Consider it a peace offering.” 

He looks at the items in his hand, then back at me, suspicion creeping back into his eyes. “Why?” 

I lean back in the seat, still nursing the pain in my head. “Because I don’t want you coming after me again. And because you’re not my problem anymore.” 

David’s still skeptical, but he doesn’t argue. He pockets the items, his grip on the wheel relaxing just a little. I get out of the car and just start running. Screw this shit, I’m not giving him a chance to hit me again. 

 

Chapter 8 

I’m beat. My head’s pounding, my ribs feel like they’ve been through a meat grinder, and I’m not even sure which direction I’m walking anymore. Everything around me’s a blur—neon lights, the hum of traffic, people moving like shadows. I’ve been running on fumes for days, and it’s catching up to me. But I can’t stop now. Stopping means thinking, and thinking means facing all the shit that’s gone down. Denny’s gone, Georgetta’s dead, and David... well, I’m lucky I’m not a smear on his driveway right now. 

I know I need a plan, something better than stumbling around hoping for a miracle. But the truth is, I’m out of my depth. I’ve always been good at surviving—scraping by, bullshitting my way through tight spots. But this? This is different. This is big. Too big for me to handle alone. 

And that’s when it hits me. 

There’s one guy I know who might have a clue about what the hell’s going on—DM. Yeah, Dungeon Master. Don’t ask, it’s his thing. Weird, but the dude’s a genius when it comes to tech. He built my memory glasses, and if anyone knows what’s up with this whole mess, it’s him. 

DM’s place isn’t far. I can use some of the cash I got from Georgetta’s place and catch an Uber there. He’s got a decent setup—a nice house in a quiet neighborhood, the kind that screams “suburban bliss.” He made bank on the black market, enough to buy the house when his mom lost hers. He lets her live there, but he stays in the basement, because of course he does. It’s what he knows. 

I pull out my phone and put in for a ride. I need to know what the hell’s going on, and DM’s the best shot I’ve got. Even if he is a nerd with more action figures than friends. 

I have the driver drop me off a few blocks away and trek the rest of the way there. When the house finally comes into view, I begin to feel a little better. It’s quiet, streetlights illuminating every dark corner of the street. The type of neighborhood where if you mow your lawn too late in the evening someone will call the cops. No need to worry about too much craziness happening here, hopefully. I cut across the lawn and head for the side door that leads down to the basement. No need to bother his mom—she’s sweet, but I’m not in the mood for small talk. 

I knock twice—our usual signal—then push the door open and head down. The smell hits me first: a mix of Red Bull, chips, and that musty basement air. The walls are plastered with posters—video games, anime girls, and some plastic armor and other cosplay shit. Shelves are lined with tech parts, but it’s all pretty tidy, considering. DM’s in the middle of the room, VR headset on, swinging around like he’s in some epic battle. 

“Yo, DM!” I shout over the sounds of the game. “Stop playing with your virtual girl for a sec, we gotta talk.” 

He doesn’t hear me, too deep in whatever virtual hell he’s fighting. I walk over and give him a shove. “Hey!” 

He stumbles, pulls off the headset, and glares at me. “What the hell, man? I’m in the middle of a friggen battle.” 

“Yeah? Well, I’m in the middle of a real-life shitstorm, so put your toys away. We need to talk. Georgetta’s dead and Denny is half-wiped.” 

I watch DM’s expression change from annoyed to curious. He has no clue who Georgetta and Denny are, but I know mentioning this will get his interest. He’s always warning me about Big Brother watching and all that bullshit, saying if I wasn’t careful, they’d be after me. Mostly a load of crap, but DM is smart. He knows people who know things, even if he gets carried away sometimes. 

“I’m sorry, man. Were you followed here?” DM always asks this whenever I visit, usually because me coming over means we’re doing some illegal shit. 

“No, I don’t think so. I got dropped off a few blocks away, walked to the mini-mart, and got some pizza before I came here.” 

Even before I finish talking, DM presses some buttons on his keyboard, replacing the half-naked cartoon girl on his monitor with six different camera angles around the house. You can see all the entrances and any incoming traffic. I watch him wince as headlights come into view and let out a sigh of relief as they don’t even slow down and pass his house. Paranoid. 

“DM, I need some help.” I fill him in on the last few nights, starting from stealing some memories from the big guy up until showing up at his basement lair. He’s sitting there, eyes wide open. Occasionally peeking at his camera, then right back to me. 

“Fuck, man. I warned you to be careful with this tech. The glasses I gave you aren’t traceable, but people talk. A lot.” He swivels back to his keyboard and presses some other buttons that send the cameras to the flat-screen TV on the wall, then opens up some pictures of a building. “If they find out you have been doing memory alterations, they’ll come at you. Hard. And I’m not going down with you.” 

“Who’s they?” I ask as I walk up to the monitor, looking at the picture for any clue of whatever the hell is going on. 

“Archon.” 

“What the fuck is Archon?” 

“I’ve been talking to this guy that works for Archon. They’re technically a pharmaceutical company funded by the government. They have this place right here, which is a rehab center for the mentally handicapped. It’s a front. My guy tells me most of the people here are actually test dummies who have been wiped so hard, they can’t even wipe their own asses anymore. They’re basically babies who have forgotten even how to talk and have to relearn everything.” 

I really hope this is more of his bull because this is getting way too deep for someone like me. I’m no Jason Bourne. “Shit. Do you think they have anything to do with me?” 

DM kinda rolls his eyes at me. “Archon has everything to do with anything memory tech related. They are trying to rehab the image of memory manipulation, pushing new tech to make it safer and legal again. But it’s not safer. The old stuff, like what you have, all you can really do is look at things like a recording. You can download and import memories, but that’s it. And not core memories, like things you are taught. Just things like the first slice of pizza you ever had.” 

“To do what they are doing, you need some serious money and tech. Wiping someone down to where they forget how to chew food? That’s hardcore shit there. If they can do that, they can probably also alter memories.” DM continued. 

“Great,” I mutter. “So, what am I supposed to do about it? This isn’t exactly my usual hustle.” 

DM turns to face me, his expression serious. “Look, you want answers? You need to find out who’s involved and why. My guy inside mentioned that they’re ramping up operations at the facility. New tech, new experiments. If you really want to know what’s going on, you’re gonna have to get inside. Maybe you’ll find something that links back to what happened to you—or at least point you in the right direction.” 

I look at him like he’s lost his damn mind. “You’re telling me to break into a government-run facility? You think I’m some kind of superhero?” 

“No, I think you’re a guy who doesn’t have a lot of options left,” DM says, deadpan. “But it’s your call. You can keep running, or you can find out what the hell’s really going on.” 

I sigh, knowing he’s right. I’m in this deep already, might as well go all the way. “Fine. How do I get in?” 

DM grins, the gleam of excitement in his eyes. “Leave that to me. But first... Hey, Ma! More Red Bulls! I’m about to blow this guy’s mind!” ",1,1728613637.0,CreativeQuill,0,1.0,False

Mythology / Criptozoology:
The Peryton is a fictional animal that combines the characteristics of a deer and a bird. It is believed to have its origin in a book by José Luis Borges about imaginary beings, although he also based his descriptions on a lost medieval manuscript. It was often depicted as a creature that was deer-like from the waist forward and bird-like from the waist back, including legs, tail and wings. Borges wrote that the Perytons' shadow when flying was similar to that of a man, and that they were highly involved in the fall of the Roman Empire. Another similar myth that is strongly linked to this one is that of Eikþyrnir - whose name means ""He who has oak horns"" - a deer from Norse mythology that, together with the goat Heiðrún, feeds on the leaves of the Læraðr tree in Valhalla. At first we believed that these myths and the titan itself were highly linked to Furfur, so there was not much research into it.  But as of a few days ago we have changed our minds, as Furfur could not have even remotely inspired the myths that portray this being as a benevolent and peaceful entity, and with seismic readings from Austria a week ago we have determined that this being is definitely a totally different and separate being from Titanus Furfur.
The royal titan woke up a few days ago in Austria and caused panic due to its sudden awakening, but luckily it did absolutely nothing to hurt people and just went to the Bavarian Forest in Germany, where it remains quiet for now.

Fact:
The royal titan is itself a totally strange and abnormal life form, to start with it is not even a deer but rather a distant relative of the Stygimoloch, which evolved to be a mammal and headed towards a more aerial lifestyle.
Starting off, its front arms have evolved to be even longer in order to give the creature the ability to walk on all fours;  But that's not all, the arms have developed to such an extent that they have become wings similar to those of a Pteranodon that are fully capable of propelling it through the air without any problem despite its size. These front arms have three claws similar to those of a feline and despite walking almost like a Pteranodon, its way of walking is not affected at all. Being able to walk like a normal quadruped mammal despite this. 
The titan is covered with pastel yellow fur on top and coffee-brown fur below, which is dense and thick enough to protect it from both the cold and other types of attacks from external aggressors. 
As for its hind legs, these have evolved to more closely resemble those of a cervid, even fusing its claws into hooves similar to those of a deer or a horse. The same legs are equipped with strong and rigid muscles that have enough strength to give an amazing kick that can end a life in a single instant. 
 It has a short, very furry tail that has no apparent function, but the titan can move it in a dog-like manner to indicate that it is happy or content, or raise it and leave it completely rigid to indicate that it is seeing something that may mean a serious and severe threat. 
Like its extinct relative, Peryton has the same bony dome as the Stygimoloch, which is heavily armored and reinforced and helps it to deliver powerful headbutts to its opponents. Likewise, its horns can also develop in a similar way to those of a deer. Being lacking them during its infancy, appearing in it for the first time during its youth, developing them further during its adulthood and completing their development by splintering when it reaches the position of a leader of the species in the adult stage. These horns that it has are splintered in different parts, which gives it the appearance of deer antlers. 
 As a final note, the titan is capable of absorbing the energy coming from blows and impacts towards its person, and is capable of accumulating them in one part as well as dispersing them to other parts to finally release them in the form of a terrible kick or a powerful headbutt that ends up killing or seriously stunning its opponent. 
Fortunately, the titan seems to be peaceful with humans as well as with the environment, but it will undoubtedly attack if it sees something that makes it feel threatened, such as another titan or some carnivorous or predatory specimen in the area. For now it lies wandering through the Bavarian Forest in Germany and I would say that everything is fine, but the truth is that I doubt it very much since since yesterday the titan has been staring intently at the sky pointing towards the Northwest, a fact that makes us worry and wonder what it is that can draw its attention so much or leave it so pensive.

Me: 28M

  
Her: 24F

  
2-months

 

I (28m) just started a graduate program in another state. I don’t have any friends or family in the area, and it has been difficult. I met another student (24f) in my program back in August, and we seemed to really click. However, midway in September, she got weird. She hurt my feelings a few times, but I can’t tell if I may be overly sensitive or if maybe I’m the reason why it happened.

 

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder last year from a psychologist and two separate psychiatrists. It’s been a lifelong struggle of mine since at least 10 years old when I began having recurring suicidal thoughts that I’ve dealt with my entire life, but I think even earlier than that based on my parents’ observations of me. The anxiety and depression made it extremely difficult for me to fit into social situations, and my parents eventually took me out of traditional school and placed me in a distance learning program, so I had even less social interactions with other people after that. I think I may have PTSD as well, but I am not sure. My biggest comfort was binge eating, so I became morbidly obese, and I’ve had extremely low self-esteem for my entire life because of my appearance; I lost weight after figuring out a low-glycemic diet that worked for me, but I am still not happy with how I look. I am 6’3” 220, but I seem to still have a very high body-fat percentage, and I also suffer from gynecomastia, which has made me hate my body since I was about 6 and people made fun of me at swimming pools. I also have many stretch marks.

 

I didn’t spend time around people until I started my undergraduate, but I found that being around people in college was too difficult and stressful. I couldn’t form social relationships with other people because of my anxious thinking; my previous psychologist said that I was hyperaware from having untreated anxiety for such a long time in my life. She told me that it was my attempt to protect myself, but every social interaction that I’ve ever had followed a similar pattern: I would meet someone, try really hard to get them to like me, eventually see signs that were not overtly positive that made me think that they disliked me, and then I would pull back so that I wouldn’t annoy them. Then they would never try to follow up with me and the connection would die out. This happened continuously, both in undergraduate, when I studied abroad, when I worked, and when I went into the Peace Corps.

 

I’ve had some friendships and people I’ve connected with, but eventually I always end up feeling like I’m a burden and that they’d be happier without me in their lives. The longest friendship I had was for about 5-years with a guy I met in my last year of college. The difference seemed to be that he was really good about continuously reaching out to me and following up, so that I didn’t need to feel like I was pestering him. Eventually, though, I got into a really bad depressive episode and ended up blocking him because I was embarrassed about my life and didn’t want him to know that I had lost my job. I wanted to disconnect so that I didn’t feel so vulnerable.

 

I’ve been really scared about taking medicine, but a few months ago, I started Lexapro under a psychiatrist’s care. I found that it helped an extreme amount with my depression and anxious thinking. I’ve never in my life not had at least a day out of my week where I felt extremely depressed and had at least a general thought of ‘why am I alive? I should kill myself.’ After starting the medication, I started feeling incredibly better, and so many things seemed easier. I started the medication because after a year of CBT, I still wasn’t feeling great and I was going to start this graduate program, so I wanted to try something more to get me over the hump.

 

When I moved in August for my graduate program, I attended an orientation event with a group of students in my program. Whereas before everything was a focus on ‘what do I say now? Did I say the right thing? Did they think it was funny? What else should I be doing? What do I do now? Where do I sit? Should I say I had a great time or just leave? Do they think I’m weird? Did I do the right thing? Did I say too much?’ the anxious thoughts weren’t at the forefront of my mind and I was able to just be. I thought that I was a completely changed person and it seemed incredibly different than what I was used to experiencing. I hung out with most of the people at least once or twice after that, attended a party, and also did a few other things, but I also really connected with this girl that I met in the orientation event too.

 

My previous psychologist told me not to connect overly much with anyone in my graduate program because it is a professional program and those individuals may one day be your coworkers or bosses, so treat them like colleagues and not friends. I’m a first-generation college graduate, so I have no experience with anything in academia, but I tried to follow this advice. However, the girl was insistent and kept trying to talk to me, and then she mentioned she was a huge fan of this guitarist that I liked too. We started talking and we started sharing music with each other, and it turned out that she had a lot of similar music tastes as me. Over the next few weeks in August, we texted almost every single day for hours at a time, she had a similar sense of humor as me and we shared a bunch of jokes, and I formed a crush on her. I felt that a lot of times that we were flirting with the way that she would look at me and the general demeanor of the jokes as being something that felt more than just friendly but more intimate and playful. It’s hard to say, though, because I don’t have a lot of experience, but it really did feel like more than just friendly. I also took her out for coffee to celebrate her getting a promotion at work.

 

Eventually we went out a couple of times together, we never called each other friend or anything like that or had a definitive term for each other, but I found myself really enjoying being around her. Then our program started and the first day I saw her and waved and said ‘hello’ and she ignored me. Then a few days later I saw her again, waved at her and said hi when she was right next to me, and she didn’t acknowledge me at all. I also didn’t hear from her at all during those first week days.

 

It really threw me off and deeply hurt my feelings because some of the other people I had met did that too. It was like everyone flipped a switch from before school started where everyone was open and friendly and then when it started everyone became really closed off, cliquey and rude. I felt really whiplashed, but especially from her reaction.

 

Then that Saturday she sent me about twelve texts talking about wanting to do all of these things together with me and I got confused. I told her that she had hurt my feelings, and she apologized and said she didn’t mean to do that, but that she still wanted to spend time with me. We ended up hanging out the next weekend because she had to cancel for those Sunday plans we had. She said she got an ear infection because she was a college swimmer, so I got her some swimmer ear plugs to protect her ears in the future. She met me at a café for coffee on Sunday, and we went to a record store where I purchased her a handful of records since she had lost most of hers in her move. It wasn’t much money, but I thought it would be nice; I also got her this goofy Sesame Street album as a joke too.

 

She took me back to her apartment where we ended up sitting listening to records together for a few hours. The first one we played was the Sesame Street album and it apparently wasn’t lined up correctly or something and let out this horrible shriek. I thought it was hilarious and we joked about it; I told her she had to keep the cursed album now and that she was going to become haunted from it. She also told me about this guy she was kind of seeing from before but that she had fallen out of contact with, and then she told me ‘I want to know you’ and she wanted to hear about me and what was going on with me. She also kept talking about how guys were constantly trying to date her and stuff like that too and how these European guys at the local bar kept hitting on her and all of these guys she met internationally kept saying it was impossible not to fall in love with her. Eventually she ended up cooking me dinner, which I helped to make, and then we watched some television and part of a movie together before she had to do these swim tryouts. I went with her so that she had someone there to root for her, and afterwards she said she wanted to take me out for icecream. We spent the entire day together and it felt completely easy and fun; there was no awkwardness or hangups, and she told me again that she wanted to do a bunch of things together with me, including taking dancing classes together. I walked her home and then told her bye, and she asked if I wanted my albums I bought, and I told her I got them for her. She seemed to get a tiny bit weird, but I just told her I wanted her to have them.

 

That night I sent her some texts that may have been a bit odd talking about how it was weird that I had basically made her make me dinner and that I was sorry about that, and that I shouldn’t have made her take the albums because I got weird in my head after I left and I was thinking about her reaction. I thought maybe I had overstepped and didn’t know what to do, so I sent her those texts, which I think may have been off-putting or weird. The next day, though, she seemed to change, and her texts seemed to be less open and easy. She also said that she wouldn’t do the dance class and that ‘she had to turn down a lot of people for things to keep her schedule’ and the like. It was really weird and I wasn’t sure what had happened or what was up, but I didn’t press the issue. I eventually asked her if she wanted to see this new movie she mentioned together, and she agreed to go together that next Sunday.

 

During that week, though, she seemed different and less interested in texting me. I may have easily been over reading things because I also noticed I started to feel extremely anxious and depressed again after this, so I’m not sure I can trust how I saw everything. But it felt weird – there were delays in responses whereas before she would text almost immediately back and we would have text conversations, and it just seemed a lot colder. I didn’t really understand why. Then Sunday came and I felt really odd, and when I picked her up she seemed super stiff. Again, it could have just been me, but it felt really uncomfortable and odd, like I shouldn’t speak. I read a short story before that said an interaction was ‘like glass between cotton balls,’ and that’s what it felt like – really precarious for some reason. She also seemed to really pointedly call me her ‘friend’ too, which she never really did. The weirdest part, though, was that we got seats together for the movie, and then she purposefully moved down one so she wasn’t sitting directly next to me. It just seemed kind of odd and extremely deliberate, and I didn’t know why she did that. It just made the awkwardness even more awkward for me, like she didn’t want to be there or be around me.

 

She had had an interview earlier before the movie that same day and I had bought her favorite drink that we had been joking about together, and she said thank you and hugged me when I gave it to her when I dropped her off. That was the only point when she seemed to become warm and open again and felt like before. I felt extremely upset, however, and super confused as to what happened. I ended up texting her later asking if anything was up, and she said she thought there was something going on with me. I felt weird and I had been dealing with stress from how she had been acting the week prior, but I just told her that I really appreciated her because I hadn’t connected with anyone like her and that I was really struggling socially to find anyone I liked. She said she really appreciated having our friendship again and that ‘we were friends’ and stuff like that. It seemed like she kept pointedly mentioning that.

 

Eventually she invited me out to this concert that Thursday, but I didn’t see the invitation until it was about to begin. I went there to meet her and texted her, and then she told me she had also invited this other guy. Initially she said she was going to the concert directly after class, but she got there late and when she got there, she was wearing high heels, a low cut dress, and perfume and makeup on, and all of this other stuff. I had gotten us seats at the front, and she came to sit with me. When the other person arrived, though, she immediately told me that ‘he wanted to sit in the back so she was going to move.’ She didn’t invite me to go with her or anything, and I didn’t know what to do, so I followed her. The guy didn’t introduce himself to me, and when we were going to sit down, she deliberately moved to sit directly next to him and left a gap between myself and her again. It really threw me off because I didn’t know why she would have invited me to this if she was on a date or didn’t want me there. She also mentioned that her and this guy had been doing a lot of stuff together and while I was sitting there, they were making plans together in front of me without inviting me to them.

 

Her and the guy spent the entire time talking to each other and no one said a word to me for the rest of the concert. After it ended, we left and it seemed pretty clear that she and him were going to continue hanging out. I left and sent her a text saying sorry and that I didn’t realize, but not anything about her ‘being on a date.’ The concert ended at 8pm and at about 11pm she texted me saying some stuff but most importantly ‘there’s nothing there!!!’ like that, and it seemed extremely defensive or embarrassed to me, like she had been caught or something weird. It just really completely hurt my feelings to have someone I thought that I had gotten close with to suddenly switch like that and treat me like she did – I’d never treat anyone like that unless they had done something really horrible to me. I became completely depressed and suicidal despite my Lexapro. She had also suggested getting together on Sunday before the concert, but after the concert, I texted her that I had to cancel.

 

The next week I ended up texting her after thinking maybe I was too sensitive and she never responded. I then texted her two days in a row and she still never responded until two days after on Friday. She just sent a generic text saying she had been busy, but I had asked her a bunch of questions on how she was and what she was doing like before with some jokes, and she didn’t respond at all to any of that. I just told her to enjoy her weekend.

 

A week later she randomly texted me saying that ‘she knew I had been going through some things but that she was there if I wanted to talk,’ and it just really made me angry. It was like she didn’t care at all about what she did at the concert or that she hadn’t been communicating or responding to me, and then she just sent me this random text about being busy and everything but how she’s ‘there for me’ and stuff, and it just really upset me. It felt like I was an obligation and she had to say that so she wasn’t the bad guy. I told her not to worry about me and that she didn’t need to feel like she had to keep in touch with me.

 

It’s been over a week and I haven’t heard from her at all. I accidentally saw her a couple of times and she was with all of these people laughing and seeming incredibly happy. It just really, really, really hurts because I haven’t really met people that I’ve connected to, especially a girl. I’m a virgin because of my non-existent self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and deep seated self-loathing. It’s like my brain is in two-halves and one side realizes that it wasn’t really anything, but then the other part has this hugely deep hole of grief. I keep getting waves of feeling overwhelmed and then I sob uncontrollably. I became attached too hard or read too deeply into things because of my mental disorders, but I really thought that she seemed to like me romantically. It just seemed like suddenly there was a switch and I don’t know why; I’m not sure if I was the one who was wrong.

 

I just feel suicidally depressed because I really was hoping my life was going to be different this time, especially with the Lexapro and CBT I had been doing. I just got in to see a new psychologist because my old one was out of state, but I just feel horrid, like I have this deep, deep grief even though objectively it doesn’t seem like this deserves it. I think it may be partly PTSD because of the number of similar situations that have happened in the past, so I think maybe those similar feelings that I never adequately dealt with are coming up with this one too.

 

It just feels like no one ever notices my absence, or that they prefer it. I keep seeing all of these people with all of their friends, and I just don’t know why that is never me. I thought I was going to be able to be different this time because of the help I had gotten for my anxiety and depression, but it’s all the same and now I’m back to being alone again in my room with no one to talk to or spend time with. I just don’t get why she treated me like that, and then I blame myself and then I wonder if maybe I’m being too sensitive and that she didn’t actually do anything wrong and that I was the weird one? I don’t really know because of my disorders making it feel hard to trust myself, but my psychologist told me that my feelings aren’t wrong and I can trust myself to understand social situations. It’s just confusing because I don’t know why all of this happened, and since it always seems to happen, I wonder if it’s my fault, or if maybe she was the one who knew what she was doing and that she really didn’t want me to be around?

 

The only thing I can think of is that she felt desperate, connected with me early on before the program started and she was still alone, and then when classes started she began hanging out with more people, and then she found people, like this guy, that she preferred, and then suddenly I wasn’t worth the time or effort anymore because she ‘traded up’ to someone better. I had similar things happen in the past, and it seems to make the most sense to me, but I’m not sure if that sounds crazy or not. It seems like her suddenly calling me friend, deliberate efforts to do things like sit apart from me and keep me physically distant, the longer and longer times between texts, and stuff like that means she wasn’t interested in me and wanted to disconnect.

  
Just after that Sunday ‘date’ we had, she seemed to change and got distant. Texts were longer and longer to receive, my jokes no longer seemed to make her amused, she seemed less interested in expending effort towards me, then the concert thing was really hurtful and completely rude in my opinion. Am I the one in the wrong here? Am I crazy? Or was she just a shallow person that I shouldn’t have gotten this wrapped up in? I guess I wish I could have that relationship from before back, but I think that was never real and just a front for her to feel connected. I don’t know why she would do that to me.

 

It feels horrible. Is it my fault?

  
TL;DR I have mental disorders. I met a girl that I thought was romantically interested in me. We seemed to connect in a really deep way. I thought we had a couple of dates together. Then she got distant and I didn't understand why. A really embarrassing experience happened when she invited me to a concert and it was clear she was on a date with another guy who came later. I ended up telling her she didn't need to feel obligated to stay in contact with me. She never texted me and she seemed to be really happy with friends when I see her. I'm all alone again and I'm depressed.",1,1728613594.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

The GCP will not necessarily make things shorter. Moreover, she doubts I can mod it to PID, since I am struggling with much more basic tasks (already bought the kit). 

Essentially what she is saying is an upgrade is about making life easier, so a Breville Briata Pro or Bambino Plus is where I needed to go. I am spitting everything I read online. But do I believe it? Not sure. ",2,1728613511.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

I use senshistock a lot for body refs, but they tend to focus on dynamic/action poses, especially with large people, and I just want to draw a shirtless fat guy drinking a cup of coffee to try to balance out all of the “fit buff guy” anatomy I’ve been practicing with lately.

1g0zkzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1g0zkzk/entitled_woman_who_thought_she_owned_the_park/,Entitled Woman Who Thought She Owned the Park – Justice Served,"So this happened a few months ago, and I still think about it. It was one of those rare moments when the universe actually balances out a situation perfectly.

I live near a park where a lot of people from the neighborhood go to relax, walk their dogs, or just hang out. There’s also this homeless guy, I’ll call him Tim, who’s been living near the park for a while. Tim’s actually a pretty nice guy. He doesn’t bother anyone, always picks up after himself, and even helps clean the park sometimes. He’s got a little spot with a bench and some blankets, and that’s where he stays. People in the community sometimes bring him food or coffee, and he never asks for anything.

Well, one day I was out walking my dog, and I saw this woman—classic Karen vibes—marching over to where Tim was sitting, minding his own business. She had one of those expensive yoga mats under her arm and a tiny dog on a leash. You could just tell she was looking for a reason to cause trouble.

She stops in front of Tim and starts berating him about how he shouldn’t be in “her” park, that he was ruining the view, and how he needed to “get a job” and “stop being lazy.” She was loud, rude, and drawing attention, but Tim just sat there, calmly explaining that he wasn’t hurting anyone and had every right to be in the park like anyone else. She, of course, wasn’t having it. She threatened to call the cops and have him removed for trespassing, even though it’s a public park.

A small crowd started forming because she was causing such a scene. A couple of us tried to step in, but she wasn’t listening to anyone. She eventually pulled out her phone and called the cops, making it sound like Tim was some kind of dangerous vagrant harassing her, which was a total lie.

Here’s where it gets good.

The cops arrive, and this woman puts on her best victim performance, saying how she feels “threatened” and “unsafe” with Tim around. Tim stays totally calm and tells the cops exactly what happened, but it’s clear the woman expects them to side with her.

But the cops… don’t. Turns out, one of the officers knew Tim. The cop says, “Oh, hey Tim! How’s it going?” They talk for a minute, and it’s clear this officer knows Tim isn’t some dangerous guy, just a homeless man down on his luck who’s never caused trouble.

The cop then turns to the woman and says, “Ma’am, this is a public park. Tim has every right to be here, just like you do.”

Her face completely changes. She starts sputtering, saying how it’s unacceptable that “people like him” are allowed in places like this. She keeps pushing, asking if the officer can “do something” to remove him. The cop’s response?

“Ma’am, if you keep causing a disturbance, you will be the one removed from the park.”

Boom. You could hear a pin drop. The crowd was loving it at this point. The woman huffed and puffed, grabbed her dog, and stomped away, clearly embarrassed that her entitled attitude had backfired.

After she left, some people in the park came over and gave Tim some food and drinks, just to show support. The cop hung out for a bit to make sure everything was okay and chatted with Tim like they were old friends.

It was such a satisfying moment, seeing this entitled woman get shut down and realizing that just because you’re loud and obnoxious doesn’t mean you’re in the right. Tim’s still there at the park, and now it seems like people look out for him even more.

I'd posted [a very brief actual-play report](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaGreenRPG/comments/17ff80d/comment/k6aorb5/?context=3) covering the very first part of this scenario a long, long time ago; now, I'll presenting not only the eventual Google Doc writeup section-by-section, but also some brief play notes about what worked and didn’t work, and questions of plot and structure I am still trying to resolve. Obviously, spoilers for it below.

=====================================================================

# Preface

*The Color of His Eyes* is an old 5^(th) Edition *Call of Cthulhu* scenario from the *Secrets of San Francisco* location book. Like a lot of the scenarios in that book, I thought it had a very novel premise and somewhat screwy execution, which is exactly the kind of material that I *really* like reworking. This one in particular seemed like its introductory events would attract a *lot* of attention from pretty high-level government authorities *very* quickly, so I decided to go ahead and make it specifically a *Delta Green* game.

I decided to set it in and around Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland (instead of San Francisco) because I’m reasonably familiar with the area and it happens to include *just about every institution and location of significance to the scenario* within about three city blocks.

I’ve Handled two abortive play-by-post runs of the scenario; one cut off very early due to plain old IRL scheduling issues; but I got the sense that actual flaws in the scenario itself were dragging the second downhill before it too ended (in an oddly symmetrical way, with one player losing his job and another getting hired, leaving neither with the time to devote to a game). Due to the longer-form narration that PBP naturally tends to, I’ve included some of the larger descriptive sections that I put together in `quotes`. Additionally, I’ve included what I think might be useful information on what both groups *did* in the first parts of the scenario, and questions or possible issues I am looking for help with, in **bold**. Hopefully as I continue to workshop this thing, the bold text will be replaced with more and more possible writeup that once could use to actually *run* the scenario, which will end up going on Google Docs somewhere.

Shorter section this time, covering four additional areas the Agents can explore. One was a disaster in actual play. Two others went pretty well, and I think their writeups are solid. The fourth, I think I am just not going to use:

# Area: Cuyahoga County Coroner’s Office

This building is located on the triangular junction of Cedar and Carnegie Avenues; Garrick’s past trail (and, consequently, the Primary Color’s radiation trail) goes right past it. Two Case security vehicles, a van panel van and a patrol car, are visible in the parking lot outside.

**TODO: This is where things went pear-shaped** ***very*** **quickly in the one play run that actually made it here- and not in a fun way, just an anticlimactic, silly, and weird way that I as Handler didn’t know quite how to recover from and which basically put the scenario into a death spiral.**

**So, the** ***idea*** **here was that Sleight and two of the Case security guards had taken Ted Baker’s body here, and were currently shut up in an autopsy room with the coroner, Martin Cleggman, trying to pressure him into signing off on a death certificate with the cause listed as lightning strike. The receptionist would initially be distrustful of other armed people in uniforms flashing badges just like the security guards did, but then break down:**

>**""I don't know."" She leans forward, rubbing her temples. ""They came running in here around seven-thirty, two security guys and a man in a suit. They brought that mail van up to the back, but wouldn't let the guy who handles deliveries back there. Cleggman told him to go home, then he's been shut up in the back with them ever since. I went back there to... well, I asked if they wanted coffee or something but I was really just curious and then one of them pointed a gun at me, and... I don't know. I don't know, something's going on, there's all those cops over at the Cleveland Clinic and the university and now** ***you're*** **here, and...""**

**The goal was to create a situation where the Agents would want to gain access to the autopsy room ASAP, ideally charging in with weapons drawn, and Sleight would then deny any wrongdoing on Case’s part, his word and the guards’ against Coroner Cleggmann.**

**What** ***actually*** **happened was one Agent asked the receptionist to pull up the security cameras he expected to be located** ***inside*** **the autopsy room and accessible from her desk computer alongside, like, the cameras showing the front and rear** ***doors*****. Not only did it seem odd to me that the coroner’s office would bother, but I’d think this would outright not be** ***allowed*** **by rules relating to medical confidentiality and the treatment of dead bodies. After that, the same Agent phoned the supervisor of the security guards at the Glennan Building lockdown, where they had just been turned away, and asked “if there's any reason why two of his guys would commandeer the coroner's office across the street, and point a gun at the receptionist”;he took the supervisor entirely at his word when the supervisor said ‘no’.**

**They dawdled long enough in the lobby looking at security footage and calling Cleggman’s cell phone (they got voicemail) that I decided to make some loud noises in the ambulance bay to push them along- the two security guards trying to find the keys to the coroner’s van parked there, so that they could dispose of the incriminating body (I was thinking it might’ve ended up in the Cuyahoga, with the van being left at a chop shop in East Cleveland) while Sleight stayed behind with Cleggman to try to disavow everything.**

**The same Agent who’d asked about the camera in the autopsy room actually snuck back through a storage area and witnessed the guards loading the very clearly Color-attacked body in a Case security uniform into the van, then turned around and went** ***back*** **to the reception area leaving the guards to it.**

**Eventually I had Cleggman, in the absence of the two guards, physically push his way past Sleight and exit the autopsy room for the lobby, with Sleight following along behind him. The Agents saw this on camera and held both at gunpoint, demanding answers:**

>**""I was** ***attempting*** **to deescalate the situation here at the coroner's office. Some of our security men seemed to take issue with Dr. Cleggman's handling of the case, and, after learning that they'd been let go in an unrelated matter, seem to have decided to take the situation into their own hands.""**

**Surprisingly, either the Agents took him at his word or made no mention of any suspicions in chat, and instead asked about how the body got there. Sleight repeated the lighting-strike story, and, again, they didn’t openly question it. At about that time, the security guards managed to get the van started and flee; only to be immediately intercepted by another Agent heading over to the coroner’s office in a Cleveland PD squad car with Detective DeLoitte. My plan was for the security guards to lawyer up once detained (an added bonus of DeLoitte being involved was that she’d insist on doing everything by-the-book and not just keeping the guards tied up in a basement somewhere), and for Case to then make a stink about jurisdiction or otherwise work to get them released.That Agent’s player was the first to need to leave, so I never got to actually run that happening.**

**The other Agents managed to** ***not*** **get Sleight acting obstructive and assholish by immediately agreeing to the paper thin cover he produced; he insisted on following them to the next area they wanted to visit, Preston’s office, because I didn’t know how else to keep him in the game.**

**I feel like I badly mismanaged this encounter, but cannot for the life of me figure out what else I could have** ***done*** **to react to these circumstances and try to keep the operation on the track I wanted.**

**Also, the map I’d made originally,** ***suuuuucked*****:**

If the Agents *had* gotten a good look at Baker’s body, they would have discovered his (demagnetized) Case photo ID, two rounds missing from his handgun, and an electrically-driven mechanical watch stopped at 10:30:44.

# Area: Preston’s Office

Garrick’s old office is still listed on the Case Astronomy Department’s website, although it is now simultaneously listed as belonging to Dr. John Preston. It is located in Sears Hall, which is essentially a grimier and less well-lit version of the Glennan Engineering Building. The same card-lock systems are present, although during business hours the front doors and Preston’s office door are kept unlocked for public access. Although many buildings on this part of campus have been fused into larger structures, there is no way to get directly from Glennan to Sears. Even the brief hike across the parking lot or quad is absolutely miserable in this snowy weather- imagine going across this to and from classes every single day! (Thirsty agents will also find not a single working soda machine anywhere in this line of buildings.)

    Interviewing Dr. Preston

Preston is present in his office from 8:30 to 5:00. His schedule on Mondays is free, and he’ll be happy to talk to Agents who drop by- especially if they had previously sent out a missing-persons’ report for Robert Garrick. If Agents are making him uncomfortable, he will first claim he has a (fake) meeting and that he needs to cut this conversation short; if they persist, he’ll flat-out tell them they need to leave and will call security. Since there’s a large group of security staff right nearby at the Glennan Building, officers will arrive within 2d3 combat rounds.

Preston can provide some additional context for Garrick’s mental state over the course of the Mousetrap program, and the deterioration in their working relationship:

>Preston closes his eyes and leans back in his chair. ""You know, it's funny. Before this whole project got started, we worked so well together... were friends, even. I went over to his house, introduced my... my girlfriend, at the time, to his wife. But the further he got into it, he just got stranger and stranger, started making demands, couldn't figure out why things weren't working, wanted to put more and more time into it. Mostly wanted *me* to put more and more time into it, actually, while he stayed here in his office and did calculations. I remember he tried to talk me into flying to Moscow the day after my wedding to pick up a paper from some archive... eventually we just hired someone off the Internet to go and take pictures with their phone. But... there was never any one *thing* that he could seem to figure out that'd make it work, he'd try explaining it to me and he'd go off on these tangents about torsion fields and bonkers interpretations of quantum physics, and then he'd get angry when I couldn't follow along. It was never just one thing.”

>""He explained it to me once, but... like a lot of what he was talking about at the time, I'm not sure if I could really make sense of it. This would've been some time in December or January, winter break so the campus was nearly empty, not long before the accident. He brought a case of beer up to the radio shack where I was working, and I think he was trying to give me some kind of hang-in-there speech, but it was all just about how... he compared the whole thing to finding, like, an exploit in a video game, an oversight in the code that'd let you skip out on taking damage or bounce off the level geometry and fling yourself to the end super-fast. That if we could just get it working properly we'd overturn whole areas of physics, and nothing else mattered anymore. The more he worked on it and the more obsessed he got, the more he'd come back to that, that the universe was bigger than we realized, that there were whole other avenues of science that had been... discredited or replaced by modelsthat were easier to understand, but that they were still useful.

>I just thought he was losing his mind... obsessive-compulsive types aren't exactly uncommon around here, but it's like he just fell down this rabbit hole one day, something funny-looking fell out of, I don't know, a computer model or some big data set and he just had to keep*picking*at it and trying to figure it*out*, and the more he picked at it the more he *had* to pick at it. You said you'd seen him up at the Clinic? Do you know if they ever figured out if that antenna was even the sole cause for his problems? Or if they'd ever found, like, a brain tumor or some kind of underlying condition like that? Because I've always wondered.""

He can also provide his own perspective on the circumstances of the accident:

>""Image objects in the outer solar system, I think. Maybe beyond, but I'd guess what we might've picked up was somewhere in the Kuiper belt. That's when our equipment started to show energy spikes, and Garrick had his... accident. I'd been up in that stupid radio shack all night, trying to debug it. We'd been getting those power spikes for... maybe two hours, after never having had them before. I'd emailed Dr. Garrick, and he came up to have a look for himself. He said he thought that something must've physically gotten caught in one of the waveguides somehow, like a bit of solder or even part of the housing itself had chipped off, so I powered it down and he took the waveguide off to have a look. There must've been... I dunno, residual power in one of the capacitors or something, because as soon as he got his head up to it, *bam*, he was on the floor, spasming.""

Preston will, of course, deny Lori Garrick’s accusations that he’d deliberately arranged the accident- truthfully. HUMINT rolls can detect that he feels guilty about *something*, but it’s just that he’d taken advantage of Robert Garrick’s absence to advance his career, and that he’s not 100% *sure* he didn’t accidentally screw something up with MOUSETRAP that made it malfunction the way it did.

Preston can also arrange for the Agents to *look* at the MOUSETRAP device down in storage, although not even he can authorize them to physically take it anywhere *else*- it’s University property (see the Storage Area subsection below):

* By default, getting access from Preston requires a successful social-skill roll.
* Due to his concerns about having been inadvertently responsible for Garrick’s accident, Agents who have given Preston any reason to believe they are suspicious of him or otherwise have treated him with hostility will be categorically refused access- if severely pressed, Preston will go to Case Security at the earliest possible opportunity and say that shady individuals were trying to coerce him into accessing University property.
* Alternatively, if Agents bring up the issue of negligence but respond sympathetically to Preston’s concerns, and promise that he won’t be prosecuted even if evidence of misuse*is*found by examining the device, he will grant access automatically if asked.

&#8203;

    Lower-Level Storage Area

The first floor of Sears Hall can be accessed from the interior by stairs or elevator. It is half the width of the rest of the building with the upper floors overhanging it on the parking-lot side; this space is used for additional parking and storage, with a giant metal flood door providing access to the interior.

There are fisheye security cameras overlooking each corner of the building, guaranteeing that each point on the exterior is monitored by two different cameras at once, and another attached to the ceiling of the overhang area. There are electronic card-key locks on each door leading into the first floor (i.e. both staircases, the flood door in the parking lot, and directly in front of the elevator), and another on the storage room itself. Agents trying to access the building from the quad side after hours will find that the front door is also locked at this time. At the start of the scenario, John Preston and Robert Garrick’s keycards both open these locks, although if Case has reason to believe the MOUSETRAP device is in danger either card can be remotely de-activated.

**TODO: Maps- in particular, I’m wondering if I can grab and rework an actual fire evacuation map of this building. I know they are posted for the upper floors where students go, but not sure about the secured lower floor.**

Getting access to MOUSETRAP directly from Case is possible with a successful Bureaucracy roll, *only if* the Agents haven’t done anything so far to put themselves on the university’s radar. Even then, a security guard will follow the Agents into the storage area and be looking over their shoulders the whole time.

If the Agents *have* done something to engage Case’s ire, the only way they can legitimately access MOUSETRAP is with an emergency court order, which will be opposed by the University’s best lawyers (Law 80), require the Agents to produce some kind of clear non-supernatural justification for being allowed to access the device, and take 1d4 hours for a judge to review each attempt.

This is also the only above-board way to physically move MOUSETRAP out of storage, irrespective of whether Case has suspicions about the Agents or not.

    The MOUSETRAP Device

The physical MOUSETRAP system isn’t so much one machine as it is a collection of equipment boxes, breadboards, and mutilated desktop computers that fill a three-foot-by-three-foot-by one-and-a-half-foot crate and weigh, collectively, about five hundred pounds. Two portable hard drives taped to the inside lid of the box contain documentation, schematics, data logs, and source code. The “business end” of the device is a five-pronged antenna backed by a reflector dish, about a foot in diameter. A person can pick it up and carry it around, but it needs to be anchored to a vibration-free surface to function properly.

3d2 hours of study and a hard success on an Electronics, SIGINT, Computer Science, or Science (Physics) roll are required to make any sense of how the machine was supposed to work and how it is supposed to be set up. If the Agents are going off of copies of the files only and don’t have the physical mechanism to examine, this roll receives a penalty die; alternatively, if John Preston or Robert Garrick is present and able to explain their experiences with the device, the difficulty becomes regular:

https://preview.redd.it/f4h3xapzd1ud1.png?width=1379&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b603307530df4614f6e95715d20bf04c6f008a

>The idea is that the beam of electromagnetic energy it transmits has a second, lower or higher-frequency component with a velocity going back into the receiver: the grant proposal makes repeated use of this GIF-

https://i.redd.it/cov4mox9e1ud1.gif

>  
However, inside the waveguide, some kind of interference or superposition happens, and according to some very dodgy interpretations of quantum mechanics (that's the Sagitov part), the negative component doesn't just have a direction pointing from the object the telescope was pointed at, but *acts as though it were actually emitted from that object* and carries information about its surface and properties.

Anyone who actually successfully understands MOUSETRAP gains 1 point of Unnatural knowledge and loses 1 point of Sanity.

The documentation also contains an email log handout explaining the events of Garrick’s accident, if the Agents were for whatever reason unable to get it from Preston:

https://preview.redd.it/slrqk5fge1ud1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=77875ff3a6bd43a7e248a4ab22662c61a1511adf

Even properly assembled and configured, MOUSETRAP needs several additional racks worth of high-powered modulator equipment to actually transmit its signals- this is what Garrick had taken over W8EDU’s radio shack to access.

The padded crate MOUSETRAP is stored in provides 10 armor points. Any damage taken by the innards renders the device inoperative until it is repaired. This can only be attempted by one or more people who understand the device’s operation, and have access to electronic parts (which can be found in other labs at Case, or from hobby stores). Let each person working on repairs make an Electronics, SIGINT, Computer Science, or Science (Physics) roll. Subtract *the amount by which the roll succeeded* from the damage the device sustained.

# Area: Garrick's House

An unassuming suburban residence, currently occupied by Dr. Garrick’s wife Lori.Until he has no other choice and/or is able to explain the situation to Lori, Garrick will avoid coming here. He knows that where he goes, the Primary Color will inevitably follow, and doesn’t want it coming anywhere near his wife.

Before Garrick steals the MOUSETRAP device; Agents looking into the garage (either through the windows in the garage door visible from the front, or asking to see it inside the house, or breaking in) will see a silver Toyota Camry (Lori’s) and a brown dust-cover concealing a white Ford Ranger pickup truck (Robert’s); and the snow on the driveway will be undisturbed. After the raid on Sears Hall, there will be fresh tire tracks and the dust cover will have been removed from the pickup.

If the Agents come calling before the raid, Lori will be distraught but polite, and invite them inside to talk about her missing husband, offering coffee in a living room that -aside from a truly gargantuan flat-panel TV- doesn’t appear to have been touched since the Reagan administration.

Lori can confirm that Garrick was under a lot of pressure to produce results on his latest research project before his accident, and that he seemed not so much unwilling as unable to properly explain what he was actually working on. Lori is herself an electrical engineer specializing in radio communication systems, but she’d always lose the thread when Roger dived into bizarre interpretations of fundamental quantum phenomena. He would often come home at two or three AM, and then be gone back to work when she woke up again next morning.

Before he started work on MOUSETRAP, Lori’s life with Roger had been utterly normal. She’s supported him throughout his year-long hospitalization, and is devastated to hear that he’d gone missing just as he seemed to be starting to get better. She has nothing but praise for Dr. Van Hyne and the Cleveland Clinic.

Lori will also seek the first possible opportunity to bring up to anyone in or near law enforcement, her pet theory that Dr. John Preston had some kind of deliberate hand in Robert’s accident. As the MOUSTRAP project wound on, every single one of Garrick’s graduate students quit and moved on to other things, except for Preston. Then, when the two of them were working alone at night, Garrick was knocked unconscious by a “random” power spike in the device? Right after Preston had been fiddling with it unsupervised? And then Preston graduates and moves right into Garrick’s vacant position in the Astronomy Department? Lori’s absolutely furious that she’s the only one who seems to be able to connect the dots!

Lori still has Robert’s old Case ID card in a drawer in her home office with all her other papers, and it is still in the university system. Clever Agents might play to her suspicions about the MOUSETRAP device being sabotaged, to get her to hand the keycard over so they can investigate the device in Sears Hall (which also forces Dr. and Mrs. Garrick to make a more spectacular entrance when it’s time to take MOUSETRAP for themselves). Of course, if he realizes the Agents are interested in the Garrick family, Alexander Sleight might do the same thing and get hold of the card for himself. Even if he can’t physically take it (such as if the Agents already did- *especially* if the Agents already did), he can have it invalidated in the security system with a single phone call.

Eventually, Garrick *does* come home, where he and Lori (and possibly Dr. Preston, if he’s been recruited) work to steal the MOUSETRAP device from Sears Hall. If the Agents visit while Garrick is present, either just before the heist or after, Lori will try to hold an entire conversation with them while standing in the doorway. If the Agents try to force their way inside, she has an ancient Remington shotgun loaded and sitting on the foyer table just out of sight!

Dad and I split 10 years ago. Son has always been a bit quirky and likely on the spectrum.  Mental illness began to emerge about 3 years ago and culminated into bipolar symptoms with delusions about a year and a half ago.  His dad moved his GF and her kids in 3 years ago before things were obvious.  He’s had 4 hospital stays in the last year, gets on meds, does great for a week and stops taking them.  Dad put down a boundary- to stay at home, you must take your meds.  Son left and spent the better part of the last two months on the street - sleeping under a bridge.  He held his job until 3 weeks ago.  Things went downhill fast for him.  He landed on my doorstep defeated.  His dad got him a room and we met the next day.  We had a plan to help him apply for a housing program he qualifies for.  While we waited for the appointment dad put him in an Airbnb.  The day of the appointment he bolted on me when it was time to leave.  The next few days got bad with delusions and threats of self harm.  I filed for an emergency admissions and he was picked up and evaluated.  They’d have kept him and he would have had a 10 day stay but he decided to volunteer to stay which changed the whole game.  He was able to sign himself out the next day.  He called his dad that night saying he knows he won’t have a warm place for the winter if he doesn’t take meds and that he was willing to go on them to stay off the streets.  Dad agreed to put him in a hotel until they could talk. 

Dad came yesterday and told him he needed to see he was serious before bringing him home.  Stay on meds and go to next weeks two appointments.  Son seemed eager to comply.  That brings me to today.  Dad spoke with his girlfriend who flat out said she cannot handle son being back there and told dad - him or me.  Dad sounds very sad - he understands she’s witnessed the manic screaming meltdowns and is afraid to see that again. But on the other hand dad can’t afford to keep putting him in hotels.  

My living situation will not allow for me to take him.  His sister may take him in as she feels dad’s girlfriend has always wanted him gone since she moved in.  He had already asked the other two kids that lived there to find places to go before he moved her and her kids in.  The kids all feel this is an affront to their brother because the boundary was - Medicate and you can stay.  Now it’s looking like he won’t be able to and my ex - is afraid to be alone.  I feel even though he doesn’t feel right about it, he will comply with the girlfriend.  

I guess I’m open to suggestions and viewpoints.  I try not to judge his relationship- it’s not my business.  But it’s affecting all 5 of our kids.  They see him as choosing her and her children over his own.  It’s a bad situation emotionally for them.  My heart hurts.  I do what I can and spend most mornings with my son for coffee and I feed him.  He’s able to eat by the way - dad foots the bill for that too (dad is fairly well off - I’m not).

1g0ziyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1g0ziyi/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My boyfriend (he is on autistic spectrum, maybe this information can be relevant here) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me, (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. 

I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk.

 I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 

He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

⬇️Phrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""

1g0zh7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g0zh7v/breville_bambino_temperature_stability_breville/,Breville Bambino Temperature Stability (Breville Buyers Be Aware),"There are lots of conflicting reports on the internet about the Breville Bambino. Some say it runs too cold, many reference a Lance Hedrick video and say it easily gets too hot, and everyone else says it is the obvious choice for any beginner setup. Who is right? After lots of testing and considerations for the engineering choices of the machine, I believe everyone is correct and I will explain why. I invite this to be a discussion more than a declaration of fact. This is simply my opinion as someone with a mechanical engineering degree and about a year of home espresso experience on the Breville Bambino.

First is understanding how the Breville Bambino works. I will be referring to Tech Dregs’ fantastic teardown that I have linked below and the Breville owner’s manual. The bambino and many other Breville machines use a “ThermoJet” heating system to heat a small volume of water between two metal plates “in 3 seconds”. On the outlet of this flat, spiral shaped, continuous heater is a thermocouple/thermistor (I believe it is likely a thermocouple, but the teardown calls it a thermistor. It's not really relevant to this discussion). The important thing to note here is that this sensor measures the temperature of the water leaving the HEATING ELEMENT.  Once it goes past the temperature sensor it runs through plastic tubing to a solenoid-controlled valve (more plastic) that directs the water to either the steam wand or the group head. Not once does the machine measure the temperature at the group head. This temperature sensor then informs a PID controller which controls the heat released by the heater. The PID is NOT attached to a boiler. This allows for near instant ready time but means there is not a large thermal mass of water or metal keeping the heating element and water within it at a constant temperature. The only thing providing any kind of temperature stability is the PID controller. This is the PIDs only job: temperature stability in the heating element. As I have mentioned, it is only concerned with the current temperature at the heater outlet, which is before even the solenoid. This allows the heater to provide a constant stream of water at a constant temperature.

Test #1) does the PID work and will the Breville Bambino provide water at a constant temperature?

Yes, quite well actually. This can be tested by using the steam wand to produce boiling water. After about 10 seconds the water made its way out of the steam wand and the temperature stabilized at about 95C +/- 0.2 C and continued at that temperature for the remainder of the minute before the machine filled my mug and timed-out. This means that the water took a few seconds to make it through all of the internal hoses and to heat all of its pathway to 95C. Once at steady-state, the machine was able to maintain its planned temperature. 95C is higher than the advertised 93C, but I am not a Breville engineer and maybe they put in a slightly higher set point for the steam wand. Regardless, the PID works, and the Bambino is able to produce constant temperature water.

Test #2) Is my puck getting the promised 93C consistently? A much more complicated question. In short, not really, but to fully answer this we need to understand a few things.

First, Breville (and everyone else) recommends running an empty shot first. The results of the last test demonstrate this is a REQUIREMENT. Ignoring the fact that the tubes and group head are cold, you need to get warm water to shower screen of the group head, or the first few seconds of your shot will be just like the first few seconds of the previous test (no water or cold leftover water). This also means anyone here on reddit suggesting that you should run the steam wand first to get the heater “warmed up” then pull your shot is ignoring this priming effect and how the heater works. The heater does not need to “warm up”, the group head and portafilter do. By design the heater gets to temperature near instantly.

Second, most if not all of the prosumer machines have a way to pre-heat the group head and keep it hot. Whether that’s with a thermosiphon in the e61 group head or a PID in something like the Bezzera BZ10. These machines are able to do this because they have large amounts of metal in the group head that can act like a giant thermal battery and buffer. That thermal battery takes time to charge. So, if your expensive machine uses a boiler, you are waiting the 20ish minutes for the water to come to temp, but you’re also waiting for the group head. This thermal mass at the group head allows for the temperature stability of these machines. Breville designed the Bambino and Bambino plus to be affordable, so they did not include all of the expensive metal or the heating elements at the group head. The bambino depends on the heat of the water destined for your coffee to warm the group head. Now take a look at the teardown video. You’ll notice that the bambino is basically all plastic after the heater until the group head. Tech Dregs discusses this at the end of his video too, but this all-plastic design is a feature. It was done on purpose.  Not only to make the machine more affordable, but it allows the Bambino to achieve the advertised 3 second warm up time. You cannot have 3 second ready time and the thermal stability at the group head of a prosumer machine. Adding all of that metal would mean a 10-20 minute warm up period (hence why a $4000 machine cannot get around the warming period and give you 3 second ready time). A machine can have temperature stability but temp stability at the heater and at the group head are NOT the same thing. Many people are spending thousands to get around this.

So, with the Breville, what can we do to get temp stability, not just at the heater, but at the group head? Pull an empty shot to heat it up like Breville says. They designed the machine to work this way, that’s why they suggest it. If you want to get that tiny piece of metal in the group head as hot as possible follow the advice of u/rmanalan (their post linked below). They recommend using the double walled pressurized basket for the empty shot. Run the empty shot using manual mode and do not cancel the shot. This will allow the machine to run for 1 minute. Repeating their tests on my own I can confirm their results, after a minute it gets very hot. (Note when they test with the steam wand that is for heating water in a mug from cold and not measuring the output of the steam wand like I did in Test #1).

But what does my testing say? First the parameters, I am placing the thermocouple inside of the stock portafilter but outside of the basket. Without a pressurized basket, my machine produces water from the group head at about 65-70C very consistently (both with the portafilter and without it just holding the thermocouple to the water and sacrificing my hands). I believe Breville knows the machine is doing a casual warm and rinse. It does not need to waste energy on going to 93C because there’s no coffee to brew. With a pressurized basket, it is a very different story. Running u/rmanalan’ s minute test I get a range of temperatures. At the beginning of the shot I am still on the cold side starting at 70C (running the test starting with a cold machine), but by the end of the minute I agree with Lance Hedrick, I am over 93C in the 95C+ area. This means everyone on reddit feeling like the bambino is cold and under extracting their shots is right, but so is everyone that says the bambino gets too hot. The water in the portafilter starts out too cold and gets too hot. If you are pulling very long shots, then you will start to over-extract at the end. This means if you pull a shot without priming the system at all then you are in trouble. At the beginning of the shot when you’re expecting to get the sour part of the espresso, the temperature will be extra low, extra under-extracted, and extra sour. By the late end (if you are pulling a 50 second shot) then you are too hot and over extracting the part of the shot that is already prone to be bitter. This is the worst of both worlds. But what happens in the middle? In the middle the bambino is able to hold a temperature in the mid to low 80C range at the outside of the basket. Pre-heating the group head and then immediately pulling your shot allows this 80s range from the beginning and to be held throughout the \~30 second range where most wisdom says to pull your shot. So yes, Lance is technically right, but functionally you are running colder than expected and the bambino is not a machine that runs hot (particularly for the 1-2 shots the machine is designed to pull before it is turned off). Before you run to the comments about my testing method, I will concede that I did not test the temperature inside the basket or with a puck in. This is going to affect the results, so do not take my results to mean that you are brewing in the low 80s. I am here to understand how the machine works and analyze the trends so we can better understand how to use it, not measure the exact brew temp. I’ll leave that to someone else. I expect the machine, in actual use while I am not measuring, is operating in the high 80s. An area that has the potential to make acceptable dark roasts.

My theory for why this is all happening: I’ve alluded to it, but I believe the answer is thermal mass. There is a reason that Breville uses nearly all plastic internals, provides a lightweight aluminum portafilter, and recommends an empty shot. It all has low thermal mass, and the empty shot will quickly \~warm\~ everything. The plastic tubing and half plastic portafilter will no longer be cold and a beginner can quickly pull a half decent shot through it. Breville is banking on the fact that nothing will be in contact with the water for long, so if they are fast enough then the constant temp water leaving the heating element will result in an extraction where the temperature is stable throughout. (in the high 80s/low 90s). This is PERFECT for the average joe who just wants to stop drinking Keurig coffee. He’s already drowning out any minor variance in taste with milk and/or sugar, only pulling one or two shots, not buying any extra equipment, and doesn’t know what r/espresso is. He doesn’t need anything more than this $300 machine can do and it does exactly what he wants for a great price that doesn’t gatekeep espresso. That is who Breville engineered this machine for. Unfortunately for me, I have the taste and perfectionist behavior that craves a $4000 machine, but my wallet disagrees, so as a beginner I bought one too. So, what is happening to me and everyone else upset with the Bambino online? I bought a stainless steel bottomless portafilter (larger thermal mass), a WDT tool, an IMS basket, and started drinking my espresso without any milk. Now I am in a tough spot where I feel unhappy with the machine because I am trying to act like buying fancy accessories changes the way my machine is designed to brew. It is not a high-end machine. So, I will be brewing with dark roasts and using the machine for what it was designed for until I have the savings to invest more.

For a more technical theory about the temperature curve please indulge me a little longer. The thermal mass of the group head is nearly all concentrated in the portafilter. There is very little metal in the actual group head of the machine. This means that if you want the best temperature stability in the group head while using a Breville “ThermoJet” machine, you need to warm both the shower screen and the portafilter. If you want to do a complicated maneuver with a minute, a pressurized basket, and 10-12oz of expended water every time then be my guest. It will get the group head as hot as possible. The issue is that while you are changing the basket and preparing your puck, the tiny piece of metal (shower screen) in the machine is cooling down FAST. Also, all of that heat energy that you just put into the pressurized basket is now sitting on your counter. All of the heat energy you put into the portafilter also just flooded into the new basket (through thermal conduction. It’s metal on metal) and now both are a little warm but mostly cold. With the Breville machines, your only friend is speed. Speed getting to temp, speed warming the portafilter, speed in your puck prep, and speed in pulling the shot. That said, and as I’ve mentioned before, an empty shot is STILL needed. Don’t let the system hold stale water from yesterday and don’t needlessly let anything be room temperature. Any warming that can be done before you pull your shot is heat that is not coming out of your brew water during the shot and is letting your extraction happen closer to the planned 93C that is coming from the heating element. Now that you’ve warmed everything to the best this machine can, let’s follow what happens. The water gets to 93C in the heating element, gets pumped out, and hits your group head, coffee, and portafilter. All 3 act like a heat sponge, and they pull heat from the water lowering its temperature (but hopefully not too much because you pulled the empty shot). As the shot goes on, this continues and the heating element and PID do not care. They are sending constant temperature (93C) water out (constant heat). Think of the water as a constant allocation of energy per second from the heater to the group head. Once the water (and energy) gets to the group head, the water gives energy away into the colder elements (group head, coffee, portafilter), until they are at the same temperature. This means the water has been cooling down on its way from the heater to your cup and is no longer 93C. While that change has been happening over a distance, there has been another change happening over time in a single location. The water in the portafilter has been getting warmer. As the group head gets warmer the amount of energy that leaves the water every second to go to warming the group head decreases. This means more heat energy the water gets to keep and the higher its temperature. This is seen in the steady but slow climb in water temperature in everyone’s experiments (the climb is slowed by the thermal mass of the everything the water is warming). At approximately one minute though, everything is the same temperature. I confirmed this by using electrical tape to connect the wall of the basket to my thermocouple. This is where you wanted to start but unfortunately your espresso finished pulling 30 seconds ago. But once this happens the water in the group head is finally hot and 93C and there is thermal feedback to the PID. The water is no longer cooling down as it goes to your cup, it is staying constant until it leaves the portafilter. This means that the heater is producing too much heat, so the PID has to respond and stop heating the water so much or the temp will climb. Unfortunately, the PID cannot cool anything, just stop adding heat, so everything starts getting very warm at the end of the minute test. This is what Lance notices.  Now the thermal mass of all of the water in the tubes and the group head are working against the machine to keep it overly hot. You have run the machine for too long. Breville did not design their machines for this!

At the end of the day, everyone is right. Breville designed this machine for beginners. Beginner habits will play well with it. If you try and use it like an enthusiast machine you will notice it runs a little cold and struggles with medium roasts and I can only imagine also light roasts. But if you are a coffee youtuber or someone like me then you will notice it gets overly hot when you run it continuously for longer than it was designed (no coincidence it auto-shuts off at 1 min!). Please enjoy this machine for what it is!

As a side note, I don’t own a Gaggia Classic Pro, but I imagine that it suffers from similar thermal mass issues regardless of if you PID mod it or Gagguino it. Compared to a stock Gaggia I think the Breville bambino is better especially at $300. With the PID, I think the GCP is VERY similar to the bambino because the PID is still only on the heating element. The thing to note with a PID GCP is that it only has a 100ml boiler so if you run 70ml preheating things then you only have 30ml to make your drink which is not enough. At least the bambino is “bottomless” when it comes to producing hot water from the heater.

If you’re not tired of reading what I have to say, here’s my story of how I got here. I am new to making espresso and like many people on this subreddit I bought a Breville bambino as my first machine. For a long time, I was blaming my puck prep, my grinder (a fellow opus), and my portafilter. I could make shots that tasted okay, but I never made something that I was confident wasn’t sour. Pouring 8-10oz of steamed milk on top made a latte that was better than any drip coffee I’d ever made so I was happy. Unfortunately, I am on r/espresso and I have a girlfriend who lived in Italy for a year so sour espresso wasn’t acceptable for long. After a couple of weeks drinking sour shots that I had dialed in to the best of my ability, I decided to go to a local roaster and order a real double shot espresso. I noticed two things: first is the shot was delicious and I am not crazy for doubting my espresso and the second was that it was HOT. Suddenly I realized my shots were all sour because I was brewing too cold. I went down a reddit rabbit hole, ordered a set of thermocouples, and began testing.

 

TLDR: My opinion is that the bambino is a great beginner machine, especially for its price. Just use dark roasts, follow the instructions and run an empty shot immediately into your portafilter and basket before pulling your real shot, and don’t expect it to perform like a $2000+ PID machine with an e61 group head just because the letters PID are in the marketing material. If you do something different and love your bambino, keep doing it!",6,1728613108.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1g0zgw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g0zgw5/my_dad_keeps_telling_me_i_should_marry_my_cousin/,My dad keeps telling me I should marry my cousin,"I’m not sure which forum to put this on. It’s so weird to me and I don’t know what to think.
 So I (36f) have a 3rd cousin a couple years older than me I’ll call Michael, that my dad has said to me twice now I should marry. The first time I pretended like I didn’t hear what he said, and thought it was a slip of the tongue, because it was really weird and grossed me out. 

And then he brought it up to me again a few months later, stating that “it’s legal to marry my 3rd cousin you know” and that “he always cared about me”. 
And I realized he was dead serious. Wtf. 

Yeah it may be “legal” but this guy is still my family and that is straight up super weird and creepy. We share the same last name and he grew up with me as a family member. Even if he wasn’t a blood relative, growing up as a family member 
….that puts someone automatically on my nonromantic list.  we don’t see each other like that and I’m sure if my cousin heard my dad saying this he’d be weirded out as well.

My dad claims he “always cared about me”, so therefore I should marry him….and I think my dad is going delusional. He’s almost 70 and used to play football so may have head trauma?

Why wouldn’t my cousin care about me? that doesn’t mean that he thinks of me in a romantic way. He’s just nice. He treats me like a cousin. 
I wonder if my dad is one of those guys that thinks every waitress that is nice to him is hitting on him? lol 

Anyways, I probably saw Michael only a handful of times over my childhood, usually once a summer at family reunions and we didn’t really talk or hang out much. He lived in another state and I only saw him when he came to visit in summers. he was always typically really nice and shy kid and his dad was always pushing him to hang out with me, but we never really did. 

When I was in my teens he got a boat and took me out wakeboarding and he was cool, but we never really had a relationship or talked outside of that. I don’t really have close relationships really with any of my extended family cousins outside of family reunions.. and besides that I’ve maybe seen Michael a couple more times throughout the years like I went snowboarding with him and his sister once and then once in a while, I’ll meet up with him for coffee and met with him and his fiancé twice over the last 2 years because he was living in a town I was visiting.  Other than that, we don’t really talk and don’t really have anything in common. 

So I split up with my partner of three years two days ago and my mom called me  and said that she had talked on the phone with my dad (they are
13 years divorced). She told him about my split and instead of having any kind of sympathy for me or anything or an opinion on it, he just brought it to my mom that I should marry my cousin and that “Michael is the only guy that has ever cared about her…”.  She of course called me to asked what was wrong with my dad, because what a weird thing to suggest right?

I don’t know what to think about this. It kind of feels a little little offensive at this point like my dad is saying The best I can get is a family member?And he told my mom he’s only guy that’s ever cared about me and implying ever will…. Just because my cousin treats me like a normal human being? And the relationship I just got out of that person didn’t care about me? 

Oh and MICHAEL IS ENGAGED. 

He’s been in a very happy relationship for the last six years or so (maybe longer?) with a really amazing woman I have met twice now. I’ve tried to explain this to my dad and he doesn’t seem to think that matters and keeps bringing it up.
I don’t know why my dad is so stuck on this. And doesn’t think that I can find a good partner on my own. 

I’ve always had a really strange weird relationship with my dad because I just don’t feel like he has a lot of faith in me and doesn’t really love me that much. and doesn’t respect me when I tell him no about things. I told him the first time he brought this thing up with Michael that that was really weird and he’s engaged, and yet he’s still stuck on this. 

TLDR: my dad keeps insisting that I should marry my cousin, who is engaged, and I’m super weirded out",1,1728613079.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I've been doing this on and off again for a year. I am 5'9 176lbs with my clothes on (no shoes) in the morning, 40 years old male. My goal weight is 165-170lbs. I have never been obese. I've always excercised regularly in some form my whole life. Biggest I've ever been is 215lbs. Past few years, my weight has fluctuated between 180-200lbs. I have one kidney, lost one kidney to cancer 4 years ago.



I had several blood tests done while I was about 36 hours into a fast on Wednesday. I get them done 3 times a year, but I've never done it while fasting before. Everything was normal except my LDL which was almost double the normal range (186 mg/dl) my glucose was 82 mg/dl (normal 70-99) yet my A1C is at 5.7 which is boarderline prediabetes. Usually I am worried about my GFR which is kidney values, but I've never seen my LDL or A1C anywhere this high. Sometimes my cholesterol is elevated, but not high. My blood test also noted that my ketones were elevated.



So my question is, can one weekend of binging really affect you that much?? Last weekend I really treated myself since I haven't had any sweets in 2 months. I had a whole box of rice crispy snacks, ice cream with chocolate peanut butter, fairly sweet kombucha, like a whole tub of queso, a whole box of taquitos and chips, heavy cream and lots of agave syrup in my coffee with cinnamon. I can maybe see that elevated ketones could raise my blood sugar, but the high LDL cholesterol is really a head scratcher or maybe it isn't. I know I binged, but I felt like I earned it.

   He was longing to spit. After a few attempts which ended with him drooling over his new shirt, he gave up. The sonar in his brain didn’t work as intended, and emitted various high-frequency waves which turned his brain to a sickly-looking soup. There were certain electrolytes in there as well. Electrons that spread across his body, causing strange reactions as pure adrenaline pumped inside him.

   ‘Why, I can’t tell if you’re being serious or not. There’s a lizard inside your shoulder, buried inside your skin.

   Care to explain what the reason behind it is?’

   ‘I felt alone.’ That was the only answer this brain-rotten carcass could mutter without crying wolf too many times.

   That was bad. He felt that the world spun around him for no other reason than for him to acknowledge that something was off about it. There was a certain allure about him, and the way he looked at them, as if he was staring at a painting that made him feel something. It wasn’t that often that he felt something. More than often, he didn’t. And now, during the last moments of his life, he wouldn’t feel a thing.

   ‘You feeling alright buddy?’

   He didn’t know what to say. Or how to act. Or what came into him. So many things could go wrong, that he failed to notice the rabbit Cleverland had in his pocket. Ah, so many fancy pictures that he thought of. They all came before his eyes. Being trapped in a box for so long made him feel things that were indescribable. So much hatred and anxiety and the nerve of such a man, like the one before him, to question him now. Cleverland was too gutsy. Too gutsy for his own good. It made him feel terrible. Worse than that, he felt a little off. Like he wasn’t real. Like they were not real, the men before him.

   ‘I think, I take it, I think I'll. Just.

   Wait, let me start over, the wrong foot and all.’

   It was one of those moments during which Billy couldn’t focus. There were too many drool-worthy flashing images, paintings that moved, for him to focus on anything else other than his pucker-puffy, doodle-paddle. With which he rowed to the other side of the lake. With them. While they accompanied him, he thought as little of the world as possible. Other than the flashing images, which refused to stop reeling, he felt at peace. Bad, or barbarous though they were. Wait, there were far more serious problems at hand. Like a few loose screws inside Billy’s head which caused him problems. He could play with fire, if he was a pyromaniac. He could be a fireman afterwards and play his role with the equilibrium at hand.

   ‘What the fuck are you doing with those horses?’

   ‘There are no horses in here. Only the iconography that’s been placed behind the shelter.’

   The shelter was where he stored all of his belongings. They were not actually his. Stolen from an old hick but he didn’t know any better. Who had been fast asleep during the whole affair; but that was no way to treat an old war veteran. Who cared anyway? Who would report it? The whole affair was something that had been dragged by the nearest news outlet far too long ago.

   ‘Billy-boy, I think we’ve made up our minds. I wager there’d be no other way to tell you such tales of poverty and crime as there were, as there are, as there will be, at present, in the future or if we can recall the past.

   Such and such, as we’ve come here, brought by force by your need to somehow distract us. I think there’s but a need to get lost.’

   These skin-flakes wanted to leave him.

   Billy-boy used to have a favorite candy bullet sponge-globe. He’d use it as target practice, back when he was still in Texas. But that was a long time ago and there was no way to turn back time and go back to the good old days. When he’d hunt foxes in the prairie. The good old foxes, where the sun don’t shine. Where they play with their guns since a kid can hold a piss’ worth of rubble with the hook and the chain. And the big iron pearl. Sweet old Pearl. That was Billy Boy’s girlfriend. Preaching to the choir, he thought. While looking at his gal. She had the constitution of a hooker and the mouth of one and the rack. But that didn’t stop no man from barking at a tree. And it sure as hell didn’t stop Billy from ruining his chances with her. Presently, he wasn’t daydreaming moving images as if he was watching a stop motion movie and instead he was staring, with her, as the reader might be inclined to believe, at a Grecian beauty of an olive tree. Poor sop didn’t know what to say to her. He was a milksop, wasn’t he?

   Billy boy had a knack for getting into trouble. He used to carry a copper wire he’d bend like string, playfully between his fingers, that he’d use to strangle people with. For his trouble with her, he had received a ring that would grant him some kind of wish. The least of all the bugger deserved. And it was magnificent how he wished nothing, but to be with Pearl. Of course, the mere act of wishing was painfully useless. It had been so since he had actually got a hold of this wish-granting, in reality, decoding ring, from the back of a cereal box.

   Her needs were his command.

   ‘Billy boy, do me a favor and tell those two men besides you to leave!’

   ‘What two men?’

   A few more than two men had kicked off the engine for the realization car to start. He was still on the other side of the river and the men that were with him were on a wild goose chase that would lead them to some gold mine or something. Billy had no idea what his involvement with them was or what they wanted from him. In reality, his whole life was like a B movie.

   There’s something wrong with people nowadays that the reader will be more than likely to pursue the succulent need to find out what. It’s more than surprising that Billy Boy, brother of Francine, had got this far. Very much alive, despite the vile men surrounding him and their apparent desire to do him harm. It should come to no one’s surprise that he got himself in trouble again. With a ciggy he remembered as much.

   ‘Three days ago, and that’s where it happened.’ The boy pointed somewhere on the map. It was no random location, but the convenience store he had robbed. With a splinter in his finger and a trigger on the clicker. He pulled it and saw the chompers snigger. Killing the poor old lady behind the counter, the poor cashier in cold blood. Cackling with blood-gurgle in his mouth. Between his canines.

   ‘Pearl, I think I’m going to marry you one of these days. I’ll ask for your hand.’ Scornfully he said before pointing at his hansom cab. It waited for him, and her. Who could forget her? Certainly not him. They jumped at the back of the carriage, which had a pair of tumors that formed a tower. In some way it was more like a camel, with him being the jockey. With as much of the hen gone out of the shell, there was no one left to defend the country. Billy had always thought himself as a Byronic hero. A paper trick made him laugh.

   He snapped his fingers and remembered.

   His mother had been alone in the parking lot, brought there by a hackney coach whose coachman had been slightly tipsy, touched by a hint of moonshine.

   There was a huge smile on his face. The man knew what he knew. He was a genius, some sort of magician with a broken back and a cane in his left hand. They tried fixing him once and that didn’t end up well. Mostly because he shot them dead with a gun that had been implanted in his knee. It was round, like a ball, a spherical multi-barreled firearm. It had been a cruel act, the surgery. If it could be called that. Done on a dirty table. Somehow the surgeon managed to miss his very veins and tendons, barely. Smug bastard, he thought. What a cruel man, he continued. But in moments of stress, he listened to music. That distracted him from the pain the gauge caused and reloading it also. And who could forget the reloading?

   ‘Carlsen, you forgot the morning coffee. Add some sugar to it, will ya’, you cheap pokey!’

   ‘In a moment, you dirt-slug. Say, when was the last time you ate a human?’

   That one was a good one. A knee scratcher, even. He was a great slug after all. If one could call a being as celestial as he was. He walked on two like a primate. Even had a pair if you ignored the third, fourth and fifth ones that were all located in his back. But that was beside the point. Slug-Hendricks coughed for some time. He suffered the same sickness as everybody else. Red bubbly patches of skin filled with cocoon-like warts appeared all across his body. These crimson warts stood out as if contrasting with the pale imitation of red on which they rested. In some way, one could compare them with phials, since they were glassy and hardened during the maturation process. They were, after all, very much alive. Semi-infantile looking warty-bugs, but most disturbingly was the fact that the slug, Hendricks, had so many traits resembling a human. What furthered this suspicion of his was the fact that, the more he hunted and ate them, the more he started recognizing traits and patterns in their behavior that reflected his. Or echoed through his head, playing over and over again like a broken record.

   ‘We can’t be the same. I’ve consumed so many of you.’ He said. ‘In search for a cure.’

   ‘Ah, no need to worry, friend. There’s such a thing as sinecure in salvation. And you’ll earn it by proxy knowing me.’

   ‘I don’t know, Jonsie. I really don’t. You’re a traitor to your species. You’ve seen me devour members of your tribe.’

   Humans were primitive after all, after the sixth ‘Great War’. As a result of it, they brought this pestilence which affected even the mutants, who very much forgot or were unaware, even confused about their bifurcated but very much related ancestry. House rules, you got to play the hands you’re dealt.

   ‘Say, Jonsie, you think there’ll be a bounty on your head one of these days?’

   ‘Just watch your back, I really don’t want to consider feeding you to the Rook.

   With a snap of both fingers, Pricott produced a tiny flame which lighted the stove.

   ‘I sometimes feel bad for Jonsie and the life she lived. To be out there all alone.’

   ‘She wasn’t alone, friend, by gad. I swear you tribesmen get dumber by the year.’

   The extinction event had not only failed but there were bullet marks in their backs. Flagellants, all of them. Some people never change and don’t have the power in them to do so, even if forced. By Jove, there was a picture of the Grand Emperor Napoleon in their cave. What else was there to say? They even had a broken hackney coach lying somewhere in the back of it, with a few horse bones laying not that far from where it stood.

   ‘Why, my lady, I feel like the Cajun is the last member of our society that hasn’t been touched yet, nor has the touch of the ailment we seem to be suffering from.’

   There was even a worn off copy, yet surprisingly well preserved, of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake. Yet no one understood a jot of what was in it. Instead, it was seen as an object of worship, an occult thing left there for the most daring to study. Also a Chevy Impala ’97, a vintage record that was playing Clair de Lune and the very cross of Jesus.

   An iguana and a Komodo dragon were being roasted above a primal flame. They had largely abused their sinecure-adjacent status and ended up somewhere on the parts of the cave, which had all been divided by white chalk into regions of power and influence, furthering the class divide by a nonce.

   ‘It is high time to slice a piece of the cake and have it.’

   ‘You madman, how dare you claim it all for yourself?’

   ‘I do say there’s a Cajun dinner, made out of the man himself, not by him. That awaits the neediest.’

   Safest bet was meeting with Billy-Boy on the battlefield. He had a disdain for people like the reader wouldn’t believe. As a self-proclaimed misanthrope, he had a good chunk of an idea what to do next. Him and Pearl were about to embark on a journey of no return. A shut in, like some Japanese Hikikomori. Life in isolation had been a bliss before meeting Pearl, the object of his disdain.

   Pearl was christened in Pearl Harbor. True story, it’s where she got her name from. A good gal nonetheless. She gave a hell of a handshake. And she wasn’t afraid to lean into it. But enough of her personal life, for no one but Billy-Boy seemed to care about it. They had a long and disturbing history, mostly semi-conservative, tenuous as it might be, with heavy drug usage, and we’re not talking about soft psychedelics either. LSD was the topping on the cake to what they were doing out there, in the wilderness. He kissed her good-bye after tucking her neatly in her bed and went out for work. By Jove, he had as little sense as a duckling. It all went downhill from there. The office he worked in was a mess. But first he imagined having Pearl in his bed. Because he had made love to her plenty of times. And he wasn’t a virgin.

   Pearl: She’s a good gal. Never strayed off the path of good. She always did the right thing. But most importantly said it:

   ‘Fuck you Joseph, you’re getting on my nerves.’

   ‘All right shorty, love you too.’

   What a strange thing to say to a coworker. She was trying to sell a 6.8 Western to a nomad who was in the habit of spitting on people’s just cleaned carpets. The baby was hers. Only hers. Not Johnny’s. If the court would have her, or them, then he’d be all hers. A baby boy. A young and pure baby boy he’d take away from Billy. Too bad he’d only hear a second hand account of it from a common friend.

   ‘Sadness makes me want to hurt people. I kind of feel the need for other peeps to feel the same pain I do, or worse.’ – Pearl McCallican said.

   It could be the stress that comes with being a mother. Or the unwanted pregnancy. Or listening to bad music stuck on repeat. Fucking Christ’.

   Pearl Harbor. Fucking Pearl Harbor. How could anyone forget it?

   ‘I’ve almost made the mistake of hooking up with a hooker.’ Billy-boy was torn between trying again and giving up. A beastly thing ridden with plenty of venereal complacencies. Dodged a bullet there. Damned be that man who set him up. He still had unrequited feelings for Pearl, and his desires could not easily be quenched. Hicks, all around the Northern Block.

   It was the mid-eve. And February had already been a cold month, cold enough for him to forget himself. One hour left.

   ‘You’re bitter and full of hatred because of it.’ He remembered Pearl saying. The same broken record played time and time again.

   There’s a simpleton playing with his cat in the living room. They used to do things to her, the masked men who accompanied John. He acted captain for the Mafioso while he was away. A neat trick he always managed to pull off perfectly was nicking the tip of a cigar with a lighter’s sparkwheel while lighting it.

   ‘Damn you, man, you’re supposed to pack the load in the right truck!’

   He had been caught by Pearl playing cards one too many times. He asked her what she thought of it, but so far there wasn’t any answer. The girl stood before him and refused to utter another word. She seemed upset for some reason he couldn’t explain. Everything went wrong long before they made up, or whatever that meant. A few men had been closely watching her, for a while now.

   There had been a few men in her life which really mattered to her. Most had a thing for dandelions, if that made any sense, whether it was plucking them off the ground or simply enjoying their scent. It was a peaceful day leading to the Summer Solstice. No one was batting an eye at what she was doing. Pearl had gotten away one too many times with seducing a man, whisking him away to her private quarters. If you were to closely take a look at her, you wouldn’t find a glimpse or a shimmer of ingenuity, with one or two exceptions. Billy boy and his father, with whom she had shared a good deal of her life with, came to regret it bitterly.

   “Great morning to ya’”

   It went largely ignored. For someone who particularly enjoyed being in the middle of attention, now she seemed to hold a large amount of disdain towards it. For wont of a better term, there was this little, peculiar, yet almost delirious desire to make due with her unique gifts.

   ‘I think we should break up.’ She said monotonously. It’s been way too long since Pearl felt any affection towards Billy.

   How could someone like her, a good gal, in all regards, be so utterly tenebrous in blaspheming the one true god, Jesus cross, the Holy Spirit and the cross?

   ‘Ma’am, you’re holding up the line.’

   The cashier said during the melancholy day.

   ‘Move on.’

   But Pearl refused to listen to that crazy lady and kept checking her phone. She received something close to zero calls in the past five or so minutes, which mildly annoyed her. Earlier that day she almost OD’d on some M and M’s with holes in them. Not the greatest experience she had. Consumables were one thing but this was borderline attempted homicide. And she almost ingested them as well. An attempted murder, she thought. What a sad attempt at a Valentine’s gift.

   There was something about their common acquaintance, Frank, who appeared to unsettle both of them. He kept secrets from them both and had pretty much been an obnoxious asshole for the greater half of a year. The man was as sturdy as an oak but not too shabby on the years, with a pointy nose and a limp that wouldn’t give him peace. He always had his lazy eye on the target and has a wont to advance in rank, past his current station in life. Sadly enough, he was rather envious of many people, but never grinned too lofty in public, letting people know of his real intentions. As for his profession, he was a money lender, which excluded him from being considered a candidate for many functions in the office. But that never stopped the man from trying.

   ‘For the greater good of my people, I swear that I shall not stop until I have delivered something worthy of my name and county!’ He was a native of Alabama.

   ‘Are you done, Frank?’

   ‘Not yet, my good man, I’ve yet to achieve my dreams.’",1,1728612336.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1g0z828,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1g0z828/3132_weeks_frustrated_and_scared/,"31-32 weeks, frustrated, and scared. ","I (30F) don’t know if I’m 31 or 32 weeks, there was a discrepancy between what they told me before and my chart. Either way, I had a routine OBGYN appointment Tuesday. I saw a new nurse practitioner midwife instead of my usual OB doctor. I love my OB but he rushes through things and doesn’t give me much time to talk or ask questions. Thankfully, the midwife seemed more willing to listen and advise. I told her that the week before I started having insane itching especially at night to the point I can’t sleep. I mean, still awake at 6 am can’t sleep. I’ve gotten up in the middle of the night and showered, shaved, exfoliated, moisturized… all to no avail. The only thing that has helped at all is Benadryl, and not because it takes the itch away but because it makes me so sleepy I can ignore it. It is NOT on my palms or soles of my feet, but I read it could be a symptom of cholestasis anyway, so I brought it up, and also mentioned that my mother had had liver problems while pregnant with my little sister and had to be induced the day they got her labs back. 

She left the room immediately to send in a request for me to have blood work drawn to check out my liver and kidneys. When she came back, she also told me “you’re dehydrated. [Something] was really concentrated in your urine. You need to drink more water.” I was a little surprised and said “That’s all I drink all day, every day. Maybe one decaf coffee 2-3 times a week, if that.” She said “really?” I said “yes… water or flavored water all day, every day.” And held up my water bottle. She just said “hmm.” And didn’t say anything by else about it. The girl in the lab asked if I had ate or drank anything today, and I told her yes, but apparently I needed to start drinking more water. She said “yeah. I think that’s why she wants to run these tests.” I said “I told her I was having a lot of trouble with itching.” She said “oh, that’s not good either.” And that was it. Had the blood drawn and left. 

Fast forward to today, I woke up to an email that my lab results were ready. I had five different results that were abnormal, but the bile acid test was blank and said “no frozen serum received.” The 5 abnormal labs are all related to liver problems, preeclampsia, and HELLP. I called the office to see if they had had time to review them and the receptionist told me “I’m pretty sure you’re on her call list. Give her until the end of the day.” 

A little after 11am, the girl from the lab called. They lost one of the vials of my blood and that is why the bile acid result was missing. She said I needed to come in “as soon as possible” to have it redone. I told her I couldn’t come until after 3:30 today and she said that was fine, for me to come in then. So I did. I asked the receptionist at the appointment if the midwife or OB had a moment to talk to me about the lab results we did receive because otherwise I was just going to stress myself out, and she went back to check. She came back and told me “She isn’t super concerned right now. The labs that were abnormal coincide with the lab we’re doing today and that’s why she needed you to come in and have it redone.” 

Yeah, no shit. And that was all that was said. Redid the bloodwork and left. It takes several days to get that back, and it’s almost the weekend. 

At my appointment Tuesday, the nurse said my blood pressure was high and asked if I usually had high blood pressure. I do not. It’s been normal at every appointment. I always ask to make sure because I had preeclampsia with my son and had to have a c-section at 37 weeks. (I was diagnosed around 36 weeks.) He was in the NICU for about a week. 

I know the risk is higher in future pregnancies, so I’m freaking out that I have preeclampsia again, or even scarier, HELLP since most of the abnormal labs indicate something being wrong with my liver.  And I know that HELLP can progress pretty fast. It’s still so early and baby still has so much growing to do. My mom and entire extended family are about to go out of state for two weeks and even though I’m old and married, I still want my mom if something goes wrong. I’m also realizing that I’ve had several other symptoms before and after the itching started that I just chalked up to normal pregnancy ailments, like headaches and abdominal pain. 

I just wanted to rant. I understand mistakes and not wanting to cause me more stress but I am so frustrated that they 1. Lost the vial and 2. Couldn’t talk to me about the labs that did come back. 



TLDR: previous history of preeclampsia, 5 current abnormal labs that point to preeclampsia/liver problems/HELLP, the lab lost my blood, have to wait longer for results or anyone to even talk to me about it so I’m just a mess right now. ",1,1728612280.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

\[*same day, minutes later*\]

As Tur'cax turned towards Lo'cax ,""Sire'cax? My first service is to him? It is tradition that first service is to a hunter group!""

The slap was loud. ""Do NOT ever question the words of a Senior Cax, especially a High one such as me, or do you forget the lore? You will do as told. You will bow to your Senior, you will bow to your new Captain, and you will 'fetch' him a new coffee. I must speak to Karl in private,"" Lo'cax responded. Tur'cax, holding his jaw, quickly bowed to both of the men, and headed for the service bar.

""What,"" asked Karl,"" are you thinking, Lo? I don't work well with others. My last assistant was human, and that was 5 years ago.""

""And she made it 9 months. Granted, she left due to a better offer from the Valkyries, but Tur'cax doesn't need to know that. Besides, you're the best bet he has,"" said Lo'cax.

""Best bet? I'm an old man. Grumpy, tired, set in my ways old man who works alone.""

""You're his best bet. Look old friend, Tur'cax has the makings to be a great warrior. Not just a great solider, but a great warrior. It's his attitude that stops him from being a great warrior. He excelled at every test, got perfect scores. He's relentless, he's smart. He's also headstrong and cocky. He has trouble listening. If I put him with a hunter group, he will be nothing but a great solider. He needs to learn what it means to be a warrior. He needs to learn the difference. You're the best one to teach him,"" stated Lo'cax, ""You have the training, experience, mindset, and above all else, you owe me for that stunt you pulled at Willow.""

Karl grinned at the memory, ""In all fairness, I did not know they were going to arrest you and keep you in prison for a year. I don't agree 100% with you, but I appear to have as much choice as the pup. Very well. I have conditions. Number 1: This makes us even for Willow. Number 2: My methods, my rules. Number 3: We start right here and now.""

Lo'cax smiled at his friend, ""I wouldn't have it any other way.""

Tur'cax came up to them, a coffee cup in hand. ""Your coffee,"" he said, distaste in his voice. Karl took the cup from him and took a long pull from the still steaming cup. ""Mmm,"" said Karl,""say what you want about androids, but that bot knows how to make coffee.""

Looking at Tur'cax, Karl took a deep breath, ""**NOW**, from here on out you belong body and soul to me, you filthy, mangy pup! I am your mother, father, priest, doctor, and worse nightmare. You will do what I say, when I say, and you will assume my words come from the Three Sisters themselves. You will **NOT** address me as Sir, Sire, or Sire'cax. You **WILL** address me as Sargent! Do you understand?""

""Yes."" replied Tur'cax, disgust on his face.

Karl reached up, grabbed Tur'cax's armor and pulled his face down level. ""Yes what you maggot?""

""Yes Sgt."" replied Tur'cax.

Karl took another deep breath, ""You **will** gather your things. You **will** have 30 minutes to get to ring 12, bay 58, The Silver Wanderer. You will stand at attention until I get there. Cameras will track you, Maya will watch to make sure you do as told.""

""Yes Sgt,"" said Tur'cax, quickly turning to gather his gear. Lo'cax grinned, ""Well, my friend, I will leave you to it. Just leave him at the nearest station if he gives up, but I don't think he will. Almost as headstrong as a certain old human I know."" A grunt was Karl's only response.

***An hour later:***

Tur'cax had stood at attention in front of the ship for almost 40 minutes now. He was angry. Angry at the situation, and angry at both Sire'cax and this Karl. The utter humiliation. His pack mates were on their way to a hunter group, to serve and learn from great hunters. He was stuck with some old man, with his status on the line. Two years is a long time, but better than to lose his 'cax status, and become fifth caste. He shuddered with the thought.

Detecting the movement, a hologram projection suddenly appeared in front of him. The blue projection of a short, smiling young woman appeared, as if the door had open. The hologram had greeted him, and had reiterated the instruction to stand at attention when he first arrived.

\[MAYA\] ""Getting tired? Captain will be along shortly. It would be a shame if you failed so early on. I would regret seeing you have to be punished here on the gangway. I would be so upset, I might accidentally send video of it to the hunter ship your pack mates are on. What a horrid thought.""

""Maya, leave him alone. Did he follow all orders?"" Karl asked, coming up the gangway. 

\[MAYA\] ""Yes...Captain. The Florixan named Tur'cax arrived 22.4 minutes after you informed me. He placed his gear by the door, and minus a brief shudder, has stood perfectly at attention. Although he did sneer at me when I first showed myself.""

""Good. I see you met Maya. She is, she is the AI for my ship, acting as pilot, co-pilot, navigator, and quartermaster. Maya, are they finished loading up the cargo?""

\[MAYA\] ""Yes Capt.""

""Good,"" said Karl, looking to Tur'cax, ""Alright, here's your next orders. We keep a schedule on this ship. We follow the Terran weekdays. Monday thru Saturday, you will awake at 0500. You will be in front of your door by 0530. Breakfast is 0600-0630. Daily briefing at 0630. Twice a day, you will spend one hour in the makeshift gym. Twice a day you spend one hour in the holo-room. Sundays are a free day. Once we get on board, you will pick one of the two spare quarters. You will have 48 hours to clean it, get your stuff in there, and get it inspection ready. You will not ever have reason to enter my quarters without my express permission. In my absence, MAYA is in charge. Do you understand?""

I'm at a time in my life where I'm looking for someone to have good conversation, share common interests with, enjoy each other's company, and possibly lead to something long term. 
I do social work for a living. I'm blessed to be in a career I can change someone's life every day.
I love travelling. Spent a few weeks on summer holiday in the EU. Hikes are well worth it for the view. On quiet weekends I also love to walk along the river or grab a coffee. Can also appreciate a movie marathon night in. A new interest I picked up is gardening/plants. I enjoy new experiences. I am a foodie so let's try a new restaurant together.

I don't smoke or have any kids.
My life is at peace right now and I would like to meet someone who equally values peace and balance in life. What I value more than anything in a person is their character, loyalty, and the size of their heart. ",2,1728611627.0,datingoverforty,4,0.75,False

I felt so incredibly uncomfortable and insecure around people, and constantly worried that I just annoyed everyone. I figured I was lucky to have a husband and children who I feel comfortable with and who show me nothing but love and reverence, so I didn't need friends. 

 I don't know the reason, but this year, I suddenly just started understanding a lot of things about myself. I started actively reminding myself that the other parents at the school aren't going to hurt me, drug me, or publicly shame me. My fears were founded once, but they aren't anymore. I'm actually surprised how few times I needed to remind myself that it was safe to socialize.

 I made friends with a family who's new in town, and we have playdates all the time. The mom is silly and doesn't take things too seriously, just like me. The kids all adore each other. Today, I went out with my friend of ten years who I've never been able to just chill out around, and I... Just chilled out. And we had so much fun thrift shopping, collecting leaves and acorns for crafts, getting coffee, it was just honestly the most fun I've had doing grownup stuff in forever. I've also become ""a village"" for a friend of mine who's a mom with very little help. Our sons are two weeks apart and are growing up together. I can even chat with moms I don't know at the school and *enjoy it*! And never, ever, ever anymore do I lie awake in bed analyzing whether I was just embarrassing myself in public or not. My parents were projecting. They were deep in the throes of mental illness. It had nothing to do with me. 

 I used to *hate* talking to people outside my family, and now I'm finding it's adding such a layer of color to my life. I'm so grateful for the hard, sometimes painful growth I've endured this year. I feel lighter and freer on the other side.

*— Bryan Stevenson*

Insights: Life’s important stuff, the real messy, beautiful, complicated things, demand proximity. You can’t appreciate the texture of a painting by standing in the hallway. Same with people—ever notice how small talk never quite cuts it? Sure, it’s nice to know someone’s favorite color is blue, but until you’ve sat across from them in a dimly lit café, watching them wrestle with a life-altering decision over a cup of coffee, do you really know them? Spoiler: no.

And let’s be honest, distance is comfortable. It’s safe. There’s a reason why scrolling through someone’s Instagram feed feels less scary than picking up the phone and asking, “Hey, how’s your heart?” Getting close? That’s terrifying! It’s the land of awkward silences, eye contact, and God forbid, vulnerability.

But isn’t that where the magic happens? Up close, we stop seeing people as two-dimensional characters and start seeing the details—their quirks, their fears, the way they laugh when they’re nervous. We start to understand not just the “what” but the “why.”

So yeah, staying distant is tempting, but life from afar is like watching a concert through a screen. Sure, you can see the performance, but it’s nothing like feeling the bass in your chest and getting elbowed by an overenthusiastic fan next to you.

In the end, the important stuff demands that we take off our comfy metaphorical slippers, roll up our sleeves, and get our hands dirty. Because, really, who wants to miss the details?",1,1728611080.0,u_Old-Passenger-9494,0,1.0,False

","Spiritual, multidimensional, timeless and spaceless. Please think about this words. They describe entities that only partially exist or penetrate our reality. Keep in mind their “other part” is in realm unimaginable to us.

   How is that possible? Thought experiment: Downscale our 3D world to 2D as if we are people on a flat sheet of paper, and higher dimension, represented by a cube can go through our flat world and at every moment of time there would be only a single “slice” of a cube inside the sheet of paper fabric.

But that’s not it! Aliens are not material higher dimensional cubes. They are something “3D” that feels in out “2D” world as narratives, events, stories only when it ""goes"" through us in a certain manner! 

Do you get it? Event types like walking to school or drinking coffee, browsing reddit - it is something you can imagine and something you can put as a goal and live through your life toward it. So the event like “drink coffee” is timeless and spaceless itself, fundamental as math. It happened to many people before you and will happen again. And for aliens that is a one single moment and place!

**“Drinking coffee” and all that leads to and from it is a single case that is a “body” of an alien in our reality. Same as all other ever existed in past and existing in future TYPES of narratives and events.** 

You have the illusion that you run your body. It is run by some aliens from higher realms that propagate through your consciousness that consist of narratives created and detected in time. It's probably true because neither you nor I understand for 100% what we live for, what is the goal? You live and understand reality only because you follow some ideas and goals. And their fundamental meanings are a mystery to us. 

It is obvious as bees that don't see beekeeper but suspect he exists.

> As Law&Crime reported weeks ago, Freeman and Moss asked the judge to quash Giuliani&#039;s claimed &quot;Exemption&quot; over the Parkside account, calling that tactic &quot;Frivolous&quot; and asking the judge to keep a restraining notice in place until he decides on their asset &quot;Turnover motion.""

> Rudy Giuliani sales pitch for &quot;Rudy Coffee,&quot; as posted on his X account in May. Freeman and Moss argued that Giuliani frivolously cited a law meant to protect &quot;Natural persons&quot; - a human person, not a corporate person - from draconian restraints, just so he could &quot;Shield&quot; Giuliani Communications&#039; funds from potentially going towards paying off the massive judgment.

> The judge began by noting that Giuliani has &quot;Failed to pay any portion&quot; of the $148 million judgment and, thus far, &quot;Has not responded&quot; to a subpoena and restraining notice that Freeman and Moss had served on him by &quot;Certified mail.""

> While Giuliani asserted that he was entitled to an exemption because there&#039;s only a judgment against him personally, not against Giuliani Communications, the judge determined the &quot;Exemption claim is frivolous and must be quashed&quot; - given Giuliani&#039;s &quot;Own admission and the irrefutable evidence&quot; that the bank account &quot;Does not belong to a natural person.""

The last time I detoxed completely, I felt amazing! Better sleep, better digestion, more energy, more calm and better digestion. The withdrawals were HEINOUS though. It was 3-4 weeks of headaches, and intense fatigue for me. 

I wish I had never gone back, but I did and I have resisted releasing this dependency because I never wanted to experience the withdrawal again. I gave up coffee during the pandemic but have continued drinking a substantial amount of daily caffeine in the form of guayusa, a Yerba mate esque tea from South America. 

I can feel intuitively that caffeine is not good for my body, and it seems like every little health issue that pops up for me comes with the recommendation to reduce caffeine intake. And still I have resisted. “It’s my last vice” (I’m in recovery from alcohol and cocaine addiction) “guayusa is not as bad a coffee” etc etc. 

I finally decided to kick it at the end of August. I started with a two-week taper and have been zero caffeine since Sept 14th.

My energy levels and mood are more or less stabilizing, but the headache is persisting.

I don’t understand why it’s like this for me. Most people seem to be done with the headaches after days or a couple of weeks at the most. It’s going to be four weeks tomorrow and I’m strugggling to stay strong.

That said, I am noticing benefits in other areas already - easier to fall asleep, better sleep quality, healthier digestion, exercising more, feeling waaaay less anxious. I know if I just push through that the headaches will eventually fade but it’s sooo hard to continue when I know if I just brewed a pot of tea, the pain would be gone in minutes. 🙈

1g0yp3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1g0yp3o/talk_me_in_to_buy_this_bakery/,Talk me IN to buy this bakery,"I am considering a bakery. It is currently located in a high foot-traffic area. Revenue in the last 2 years is roughly $1.4 - 1.5M. SDE around 15 - 25% of revenue depends on how much I want to get involved.

I see a lot of potential with this bakery. It has good menu. The cakes they have are delicious. Same or even better offering than 85o, pricing is also cheaper. Reviews on Google and Yelp are 4.3 - 4.4, mostly organic. They appear occasionally on Trip Advisor or Reddit. They don’t have any sort of online order, neither via website nor DoorDash or Uber Eat. No social media existence. They used to offer boba tea in the past but after Covid they stopped. They also sell coffee but because they put it further in the back without a big menu screen, it doesn’t sell much. No other drink offering, which I feel like a missed opportunity as well. I have lots of ideas to boost sale, and aim to open more locations in the future.

Now the challenges (and my arguments to overcome)

* I currently have a full-time engineering job. The time is pretty flexible and the work load is not so much. Effectively I can finish my whole week work in a day or 2 (I know, welcome to the world of software/computer engineers). Even with all the nonsense meetings, I figure I could spend at least 2 days/week at the bakery (+ 2 days weekend). Maybe more in the first few months (I plan to take 1 - 2 month totally off if I end up getting it). The bakery is almost in auto-pilot mode now and it’s my goal in the long run, but I know I need to get involved closely at the beginning. The bakery opens 7-6 every day, and there’s a general manager currently working 5 days a week, so I figure I need to hire an additional one, or promote an existing employee (there are 14 employees currently)
* The location is about 1 hour drive from me. At times of traffic it could be 1.5 - 2 hours drive. Good thing there’s public transportation so I figure I can get some engineering work done while riding. 
* The majority of bakers don’t speak English. Most of them work there for 5 or more years and I don’t plan to change any of them. I feel like Google Translate nowadays can do a decent job in real-time conversation. Maybe not for daily chit-chat, but sufficient for some instructions.
* Last thing, I don’t have a chef partner yet. The owner currently has his uncle managing the baking area. I need someone to serve a similar role, and to learn all the recipes from the previous owner. Current bakers can learn as well, but I figure it’s best to have someone that I can trust from the beginning who knows everything. He or she doesn’t need to do a lot of baking work, but should be comfortable doing that in case we need. As much as I am confident about boosting sales, I know learning about baking and pastry, especially in large scale, is not for me. 

I am currently talking to a person I know for sure is trustworthy. She loves baking but is a bit hesitant. She said she understands the responsibility if she commits to it, and she’s worried that she won’t be able to fulfill the expectations. I don’t know what to say to her, and I’m looking around for a potential partner at the same time. 

That’s about it. I was so excited when I first learned about this bakery. I did a lot of due diligence. I read all the tax returns and P&L and balance sheets. I put serious thought about the challenges. Often I am still excited. For the first time in my life I would have some really good products to sell. And the existing business is somewhat proven. But recently I lean more toward not doing it. Maybe the current obstacles are already too much. And I might underestimate the workload and how challenging it is to run a bakery. People out there talk about creating digital content and earning money easily it seems, maybe I should try to learn that instead? I’m a software engineer after all /s

Last year was the absolute BEST year of my teaching career. I had the best kids, best performance, and finally felt comfortable as a teacher. This year, I am teaching a new level of Spanish. The curriculum for this level has always been changed and/or lost. I’ve even trying so hard to change it so it would prepare my students and challenge them. After trying the previous curriculum for two weeks, I trashed it, told the kids I needed a day to plan and it would get better, gave them a reading to do, and planned the unit with guidance from a former teacher and a coworker. It wasn’t perfect, but it was loads better than what I was left with. On top of that, I have an overage and kids that are off the walls. 

One particular kid has been extremely challenging. She has a rough past and is disrespectful and entitled. She continuously broke the rules and when I held her accountable, she would lash out at me in front of the other kids. I sent her to the office so I wouldn’t lose my cool, brushed it off, and continued teaching everyone else after messaging admin. This happened repeatedly. Now, it’s the end of the quarter and she has an F. She skips class, doesn’t do work, and missed a summative because she skipped it, resulting in a 0. Her parents showed up at conferences and berated me for 15 minutes, asking why I personally haven’t challenged school policies against admin, saying it’s my fault she skips class, made excuses about why they drop her off late to school, questioned what the late policy was for tardies, and said it was a “teacher issue” that she was failing. 15 minutes of them just ripping into me. My coworkers at the table were dumbfounded by what they heard, knowing this kid has a reputation for being entitled just like her parents. It was also the day of PSAT and I had no plan time, so I couldn’t start my next unit planning, hoping I could give the kids a list before break since second quarter has technically started. I came home, exhausted and upset and stayed home late trying to plan the unit, but ultimately thought it would be a bad idea since I was so tired. I did cultural activities today instead, which one class period stole all my scissors and I cannot find them now.

I stopped by Starbucks to get coffee for me and a coworker who also had a rough night before class, but when I entered her room I just burst into tears. A coworker saw me, walked me to my room, sat and talked with me, and told me she could cover my class. The problem is, everything is in Spanish so there was no way. I had them read while they watched my class and came back to two teachers watching my class after seeing how upset I was. I burst into tears again and the kids probably thought I was insane. One group made an effort to try to make me laugh which was sweet. I just wiped the tears, drank my coffee, and taught the lesson.

This whole year has sucked. I feel so bad because I have some awesome kids from last year and I want to give them the best content that I can, but I’m a solo PLC and am barely keeping my head above water. My lower level classes are just insane. I’m tired, burnt out, and feel beaten down. My coworker burst into tears after school today too. No one at our school is doing well, and admin is oblivious. I’ve never cried in front of a group of students before. It was embarrassing. They’ve seen such a messy teacher this year. I had to explain to them at the beginning of the year that that one class day was going to essentially be busy work while I try to create something better. ",0,1728610461.0,Teachers,0,0.5,False

1g0ynkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g0ynkw/how_taiwan_captivated_my_heart/,How Taiwan captivated my heart 🇹🇼,"Taiwan has a way of captivating the heart. For me, it wasn’t just the breathtaking landscapes or the buzzing energy of its cities that drew me in; it was the quiet, everyday moments that made me fall in love with this island. After years of living here, I’ve come to realize that Taiwan offers something unique—a sense of belonging, warmth, and peace that’s hard to find elsewhere.

One of the first things that struck me was the overwhelming sense of safety. In Taiwan, it feels as though the world slows down just enough to allow you to breathe. Whether I’m walking through a crowded night market or exploring a quiet mountain village, there’s a calm assurance that I am safe. I can leave my belongings unattended in a café without a second thought, or take a late-night stroll through the city’s bustling streets and feel completely at ease. It’s a rare comfort, and one that I have come to deeply appreciate.

Then there’s the community spirit that thrives here. Taiwan isn’t just a place where people live side by side—it’s a place where neighbors know each other, where people go out of their way to lend a hand, and where the sense of togetherness runs deep. I’ve witnessed countless small acts of kindness that speak to the heart of the Taiwanese people—strangers offering directions, a shopkeeper wrapping an umbrella in plastic for you on a rainy day, or the warmth with which you’re greeted in the local markets. It’s these gestures, often small but profoundly meaningful, that make Taiwan feel like home.

Another aspect that continues to amaze me is the cleanliness. From the bustling cities to the most remote villages, there is a deep respect for the environment. Public spaces are well-maintained, streets are free of litter, and recycling is a way of life here. It’s not just about appearances—it reflects the values of the people. There’s a collective effort to care for the land and ensure that Taiwan remains as beautiful as it is for generations to come.

And then, of course, there’s the food. Oh, the food. Taiwan is a culinary paradise, and I’ve been spoiled with the variety of flavors and dishes that seem to be around every corner. From the iconic xiaolongbao and beef noodle soup to the endless array of street food that lights up the night markets, every meal here feels like a celebration of flavors. The diversity of the cuisine is astonishing—whether it’s a quick snack of scallion pancakes or a leisurely meal of seafood by the coast, the food here tells a story. It’s not just delicious—it’s comforting, familiar, and often tied to traditions that span generations.

What makes these meals even more special is the warmth with which they’re served. The friendliness of the people is something I could never tire of. From the shop owners who remember your face after just one visit to the strangers who stop to ask if you need help, the kindness here is genuine. I’ve had countless conversations with locals, often starting with a simple “Ni hao,” that quickly turn into heartfelt exchanges about family, life, or even just recommendations for the best place to eat. It’s these interactions that remind me how open and welcoming the Taiwanese people are.

What truly ties all of this together is the sense of balance I feel living here. Taiwan offers the best of both worlds—the vibrancy and excitement of city life and the peace and serenity of nature. On one day, I can be sipping coffee in a trendy café in Taipei, surrounded by the hum of city life, and the next, I can be hiking through a quiet mountain trail, enveloped by the beauty of Taiwan’s natural landscapes. There’s a harmony between the old and the new, between tradition and innovation, that makes life here feel full and rich.

When I reflect on why I love Taiwan, it’s not just the tangible things—the safety, the food, the cleanliness, or even the friendliness. It’s the feeling that this place, no matter where I go or what I do, feels like home. Taiwan has a way of wrapping itself around you, offering not just a place to live but a community to belong to, a culture to embrace, and a sense of peace that’s hard to find elsewhere. And for that, I’ll always love this island.",11,1728610433.0,taiwan,3,0.7,False

1g0ygsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g0ygsa/the_breakup_part_3/,The Breakup: Part 3,"Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g0hrju/the\_breakup\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g0hrju/the_breakup_part_2/)

The first three months after the break up were rough. I was depressed. I stayed inside all day. Even considered drinking again. But I resisted. After a while people started showing up at my door and insisting I come over to their place. That it would be good for me to get out and socialize. So I did. Now these were actually Sarah’s friends originally. But I had grown real close with them as well. And they were all actually very upset with Sarah for what she did. Most of them had stopped talking to her. I know that Danielle had tried to reach out, but just got nothing back in response. So she gave up. After that third month, things started to get better. I was getting out of the house more. Spending more time with friends. Was starting to smile and laugh again. I still felt like a piece of me was missing, but at least I wasn’t moping about all day anymore. 

Now fast forward to a little over a year later. I was at the mall, which I hated by the way. I only go to the mall if I absolutely need to. I wanted a game, but didn’t want to wait for it to be shipped, so instead I went to the mall to get it immediately. I used the entrances through the food court. As I am walking I look over the sea of tables and I spot someone who looks familiar. I stop and take a hard look because I feel like I know them. Then it dawned on me, it was Sarah. I had not seen her since our break up. And she was not looking good. She was skinnier, which was not great. She was already on the petite side as it was. She had dark circles under her eyes, her hair was a mess and she was wearing baggy stained clothes. She was just face down staring at her fried rice and picking at it with her spoon. Immediately I had two thoughts. Either she had moved on, found someone else, recently broke up, and this was her sad over that. Or, she was still a mess from our break up from over a year ago. Considering her state, I chose to believe the latter. I was starting to have conflicting feelings. Part of me just wanted to keep walking. That said she cheated on you and betrayed your trust, you don’t owe her anything. And another part said, this woman saved your life. You loved her more than you had ever loved another person. Can you just sit by and see her like that? 

Before I knew it, I was walking over to her table. Then I was sitting at it. Right across from her for the first time in a long time. She didn’t look up right away. But after a couple seconds she finally looked up. The more her head raised, the bigger her eyes got. She was stunned, her mouth partially open, trying to find words to speak, but nothing. Until finally she said my name. I looked at her and said, “ Hi Sarah, how have you been?” She still didn’t know what to say. She just blurted out a “I’m fine I guess. You?”. I told her I was doing great, but that she didn’t look like she was. I asked her if she had been this way since our break up. She just lowered her head and nodded. I asked her what she had been doing the last year. In a quiet tone and without making eye contact she told me that she had not been up to anything. She didn’t have a job and was still living with her mom. I asked her if she was in therapy. She nodded and said that she started shortly after our break up. So many thoughts were going through my head. I just sat looking at her, and she just sat with her head down looking away. I could tell she was uncomfortable. 

Finally I broke the silence and asked her when her next therapy session was. She said tomorrow. I asked her if she was allowed to bring people with her. She said she didn’t know, but in a bit of a confused tone. Then she kind of looked up and asked why. I asked her if she could reach her therapist at any time. She said yes. I told her to call her therapist later and see if I can come with her tomorrow. Sarah just froze. She stammered and then asked me what I was talking about. I told her that I would come to therapy with her tomorrow. She raised her head a bit and was actually looking at me now. Face dumbstruck. She asked me why, why would I do that? I should hate her, so why? I took a moment, then took a deep breath and told her that if there is anyone who can understand even part of what she is feeling right now, it’s me. I told her that it’s been over a year and that she shouldn’t have been beating herself up over this for that long. That she looked unhealthy. And that I hated seeing her like this. She stood by me when I was getting over my depression. She talked to me, supported me and never abandoned me. So I figured that I could let the past be in the past, and at least repay the unpayable debt I owed her by trying to be there and support her through what she is going through right now. She just gave me the weirdest smile. Like she had forgotten how to and this was her interpretation of what she thought it was supposed to look like. She kept repeating “really, are you serious”, “I don’t deserve this, thank you”. I could see she was excited. But she was so weak, that it just looked like some mild fidgeting. I pulled out my phone, pulled up her contact and unblocked her. I told her to call her therapist and to text me later to know if I should show up tomorrow. And if so to send me the address and other details, and that I would be there. Again, she just fidgeted around while giving me that goofy smile. 

I got up from my seat, turned around , took a couple steps and then faced her. I told her that if she wanted to repay me for this, then she should try and eat as much of the fried rice as she can. She said she would. I told her I had to go, but to contact me later and let me know. She didn’t say anything, just continued to give me that smile. I got to the edge of the food court and turned around to look at her one more time. She was just scooping  a big spoon full of the fried rice into her mouth. One right after the other. I couldn’t help but giggle. Then she just got up so fast, dumped what was left of her meal, dropped off the tray and basically just ran out of there. At this point, I was audibly laughing.

 Later that evening I got a text from Sarah saying her therapist was a bit hesitant about it, but agreed to let me come in with her. She sent me all the details and I told her I would see her tomorrow. Almost right after Sarah’s mom called me. When I saw her name pop up on my screen, I couldn’t help but smile. It had been so long since we talked, and I looked forward to hearing her voice again. When I answered the first thing I heard was crying. I asked if everything was okay? And her mom just started thanking me. In every way I could possibly think of. In between her crying of course. I told her to stop and calm down and explain to me what’s going on. She took a couple of deep breaths and I could hear her trying to compose herself. Finally she said that she really appreciated what I had done today. That it was the first time in over a year she had seen Sarah that happy and full of energy. That the moment she came home Sarah excitedly ran up to her and told her what had happened. That she really appreciated me finding it in my heart to not hate Sarah so much that I could stand to see her so miserable. 

First thing I did was state that this was not me and Sarah getting back together. I needed to make that clear. That ship had sailed. She said she already figured as much, but that it was nice to know I was just even being courteous with her at all. I told her that part of me will always care for her. And when I saw her today, that part of me was really sad to see her that way. When I was going through my worst, Sarah helped me. So why shouldn’t I do the same for her. Her mom started to sniffle and cry again. I just let her get it out for a moment before she composed herself again. She told me that I really was a great man and truly the best thing that had ever happened to Sarah. And she was really sad that she hadn’t gotten to see me or spend time with me over the last year. And that maybe I would join them for dinner one night. I told her let’s see how therapy goes first tomorrow. Then we can figure things out from there. She said that sounded wonderful. I wished her goodnight and hung up the phone. 

The next day I had to work, but luckily got someone to cover half of my shift. That way I could be at the therapy session like I said I would. I was heading that way when I got caught in traffic. I tried to call and text Sarah, but nothing. Eventually I got there, but about 5 minutes late. I got up to the office and told the receptionist why I was there. She looked at me like I was kind of crazy. She said she would ask the therapist and would be right back. Thirty seconds later she came back and told me what room to head to. 

I got to the office and inside was Sarah sitting on a couch. And her therapist is sitting across from her in a chair. I apologized for being late. I told Sarah I tried reaching her, but she didn’t pick up. She looked at her phone and saw the missed calls and texts. She apologized saying she barely looked at her phone these days. “What!! The candy crush wizard doesn’t look at her phone anymore. Now I am really worried.” Sarah gave a weak smile and a little chuckle at this. So it was good to see she still had a bit of a sense of humor. The therapist asked me to sit down and introduced herself. She said she was shocked to find out that I not only got back in contact with Sarah, but that I offered to come to therapy with her. She asked what my intentions were. I figured this was a valid question. So I told her that seeing that Sarah has been beating herself up over this for over a year was heartbreaking. Yes I was mad at her, but I didn’t hate her. I said people can do bad things, but that does not make them bad people. And that I believed that at the end of the day, Sarah was a good person, who just did a bad thing. And that maybe this would help us both get some closure. The therapist seemed to accept this answer. She asked me to tell her a bit about myself. I told her how I was also in therapy and had BPD. What I did for work and other hobbies. I only described myself briefly. She asked me about my BPD and what it was like during our relationship. Considering it tends to put a big strain on relationships. I explained to her how Sarah had helped me get through some of my worst symptoms. Not that she cured me, but that she helped me to pull myself out of my depression. That most of my BPD traits were a thing of the past. I still had some symptoms, but for the most part, I was doing much better. And I had been since the start of our relationship. 

The therapist started asking me questions about our relationship. How it got started, what it was like and how it ended. She wanted to hear things from my perspective. Since she had only been hearing one side of the story so far. She asked me if I had any questions I wanted to ask Sarah about in regards to her cheating. I said that there were two things that still bothered me. If we were so in love, then why did she cheat on me at all? And why with Josh of all people? Sarah was just quiet. Either she didn’t know what to say, or she was too scared to. The therapist stepped in and said that in the past year, one of Sarah’s biggest hurdles was to understand why she cheated at all. That she knows why Josh, but she just can’t explain why she did it at all. That Sarah was always disappointed in any reason she could come up with, because none of them were justified. It was one of the biggest things holding her back from getting better. So I asked her to explain why Josh then? She started speaking in a whisper, but the therapist urged her to speak louder and more clearly. That it was important that I hear what she has to say. So she sat up a bit straighter. Half faced me, still unable to look at my face and started to speak. 

She said that she was just out one day. It was maybe a week or so after our talk about marriage. She was feeling really down and sad because she couldn’t stop thinking about what I said about marriage. That she kept replaying it in her head so often that my maybe, was nothing more than a no in disguise. That’s when she randomly ran into Josh. They said their hellos and how are yous. But Josh could tell that something was up with Sarah and asked if she was okay. She said she was fine and didn’t walk to talk about it. But Josh insisted. He asked her to join him for coffee and to just vent about what was going on. And she agreed. 

As they sat sipping their drinks Sarah just launched into this whole thing about how she really wants to get married one day, but she doesn’t believe I ever will. How she loves me so much, but she doesn’t know if she wants to stay with someone who isn’t on the same page as her when it comes to this. How she felt like she wasn’t good enough for me. At least not to marry. How more than likely I would just end up leaving her one day anyway. And that is when Josh tried to comfort her. He started showering her with compliments. Telling her that I was the lucky one and that in reality, she is actually the one who could do better. She said she actually snapped a bit at him for that one. Saying that I was a wonderful person and that there was no one who was too good for me. That actually warmed my heart a bit. But even after that he just kept love bombing her. How she had been feeling depressed for a while and how because of that, his words just hit differently that day. She felt just a little bit wanted and admired. That she knew Josh was not a great person, but still couldn’t help but to fall into his words. She noticed that she was getting a bit too hung up on what he was saying, and realized she needed to go. He offered to walk her to her car. She declined at first, but again, he insisted. They talked all the way back to the car. Mostly him love bombing her some more. When they got to the car she turned around to give him a hug and thank him for his kind words. But he just leaned in and kissed her. And she didn’t stop it. That in that moment she knew what she was doing was wrong, but it felt like punishment. A punishment she deserved. They went from making out next to the car, to them both in the back seat taking each other's clothes off. And that’s when they had sex. Afterwards, Josh just put his clothes back on. Said that was fun, got out of the car and walked away. Leaving her in the back seat frozen and trembling. Wondering why she just did that. Feeling nothing but guilt and shame.

At this point, I was mad. Not so much at Sarah. I had already processed those feelings. I didn’t need to know the details to know she cheated, and that was all that mattered at the end of the day. I was mad at Josh. To take advantage of a girl, no, a friend, when they are obviously going through something. To play on her emotions like that and then to drag her down to his level. What a scumbag. 

Oh yeah, last I heard Stacy had divorced him, uncovered about 5 affairs that he was actively having. Used this to take him to the cleaners. Now I guess he lives in a studio apartment because that’s all he can afford after alimony and child support. Stacy moved saying she and their kids just needed to be closer to her family. 

After Sarah was done, the therapist asked how it felt knowing the details. I said that for one, I was disappointed. Disappointed that Sarah let herself get caught up so easily in Josh’s obvious manipulation. Sarah just lowered her head. I said though that if she was really feeling that depressed, I guess I can understand how she might have been swayed. She didn’t really react to this. I asked her if there was anything else that was going on. Were there any other times or any other people. Sarah said no, and adamantly. I asked if there was anything that might have been contributing to the depression? That it couldn’t have just been the marriage talk. She agreed and said that the depression started to set in before that talk. I asked her was it something that I was doing, or not doing? Was I not being a good partner for her? She immediately raised her head and for the first time met my eye line. She said in a serious tone that I never did anything wrong. That while I was not perfect, that I still gave her everything she had ever wanted, and that she threw it away for nothing. She broke down and started crying.

 Her therapist looked at me and said that this was how much guilt she has been carrying around since our break up. That she just seems unable to move on from her mistake. She has acknowledged where she went wrong and takes responsibility for it. But it’s really the reason why that has been her anchor. I went to put my arm around Sarah’s shoulder but she jumped so I pulled away. Her therapist told me that Sarah has become very sensitive to physical contact and preferred to keep it to a minimum. Sarah spent most of the remaining time crying. ",4,1728609821.0,stories,5,1.0,False

In this day and age, it actually shocks me that this place existed in a hospital.

I remember it feeling like a total dive of a diner. IN a HOSPITAL on the FIRST FLOOR. AND LORD that food was incredible. It was greasy. The fries, the sandwiches, the soup, the coffee. I would literally pay for a flight to Hartford right now just to go eat that incredible food. The sweet lady that worked in the kitchen. Everything about that place was an absolute gem.

I don't remember the name of this place, and am out of contact with anyone that I worked with back then, but please tell me.....does someone remember this place?

I have ADHD and can quite often be the life of a room given the right circumstances, but over time my social battery depletes and I just feel paralysed. I can't talk, don't want to move and just feel really awkward.

After the cake cutting and the first dance the DJ started playing and all the other guests who didn't come to the wedding came for the evening party but by this time I just wanted to go home... 
Me and my GF lived a 5 minute uber from the venue so I thought it wouldn't be an issue. Just a quick ""congratulations guys!! Thanks so much it's been a great night"" and a quick farewell to everybody else.

But when I approached my gf and simply said ""I'm getting really knackered babel I think I might head home, do you mind?"" 
She looked at me with a look of disgust and said ""yes. I do mind actually""
I said ""really? We've been here all day love I just want to head home""

But she didn't seem to want too know.
Not being sure if I wasbeing the bad guy I subtly dropped in conversation to her mum ""ahhh I'm knackered I might head off soon"" but she just said man up.

I went out for a smoke and rang my dad for advice.... he told me to go have a coffee and try to keep up with them so that's exactly what I did I took a coffee back to the family table and drank it, still not talking much to people. When some music I didn't mind came on I tried to dance with my GF as she had wanted to do but I could sense she was off and was giving me around 15% energy in any conversation, dancing or affection.

When I tried to speak to her about it she said that she and her whole damoly thought I was being very selfish...

I would never dream of making her stay until the end if she was exhausted. Infact my family would offer to drive her back instead.

I stayed until the end of the night,, nearly falling asleep and at 2am we got taxis home and her and her family are annoyed 
At me about it and are acting like I've ruined the night...

No hidden parts to the story, I didn't say or do anything else that may be construed as wrong but I'm just genuinely baffled that it was made into a thing when it could have been a nice and easy ""bye guys!"" ",2,1728609711.0,AITAH,16,1.0,False

+++++

Captain Moore stared at the strange shimmering portal, poking the energy flaring from the sides and frowning when his hand phased through the strange purple 'frame' that surrounded the magical doorway. He stood and waited even after the others passed through, sticking his head from the forest side to the other side twice before urging his entire body through.  
  
""Why couldn't we do that the first fucking time?"" Sergeant Wells grumbled, stretching his neck and giving a side-eye glance at the Grand Elder.  
  
The group moved instantly from a random place within the forest to the village entrance, overseeing the bustling settlement below. After the ceremony, the elves had returned to their former business, though even Captain Moore could sense a shift in the atmosphere.  
  
He wasn't sure whether it was due to the prospect of war, the declaration of *two* prophets from two divines, or the humans themselves.  
  
To the Grand Elder's credit, he only looked amused at the complaints. He planted his staff and took in the sight of Anidom with spread arms as if he was basking in the wondrous underground construct. ""You asked for demonstrations of my power. I simply showed you the various ways I can make a simple, mundane task seem interesting.""  
  
""Is there a limit to the range of teleportation or that doorway magic?"" Lieutenant Li asked.  
  
""The only limitation is one's creativity and power.""  
  
""So, could you teleport yourself off this planet?""  
  
The Grand Elder frowned. ""What do you mean ""off this planet?""""  
  
""Beyond the sky.""  
  
""What a preposterous thought. That is the domain of the divine; even I dare not to stray anywhere *near* that place.""  
  
Sergeant Wells gave a shit-eating grin to the captain, switching to English. ""Do we tell him?""  
  
""No,"" Captain Moore said. He felt something ringing in his ear and tapped his earpiece. ""Iris, what's up?""  
  
""*It's from command.*""  
  
Without waiting for his response, a foreign voice entered his ears and spoke to him briskly. ""Boar Six, this is Overlord.""  
  
""Where's Corporal Chen when you need her?"" Captain Moore looked over at the others and made a cutting hand sign on his neck, earning only interested glances from the elves. He cleared his throat and responded. ""Overlord, this is Boar Six.""  
  
""Boar Six, return to Foxtrot Charlie immediately. Group follows, I spell Delta Wun Fife Ait bearing heading District Echo.""  
  
""Overlord, this is Boar Six. Roger that. Will be returning to base promptly. Out.""  
  
The Grand Elder twisted his staff and stared at the metal contraption in Captain Moore's ear. ""And what sort of tool is that for?""  
  
""Long-range communications. It allows me to talk to people many leagues from my location,"" Captain Moore answered. ""I just spoke with my superiors back at our fort. It seems like my group, and I will need to return.""  
  
""How soon? Because I would also like to see a demonstration of *that* tool.""  
  
""Immediately. Though, I assume another group will be coming to replace my men since we hope to maintain friendly diplomatic relations with your tribe.""  
  
""I see… and I assume your replacements will have the same tools and trinkets?""  
  
""I would be surprised if they didn't.""  
  
Nodding with a hint of satisfaction on his face, the Grand Elder waved his hand and created another doorway. ""Go then. I will leave this pathway open for the new human group. Tell them I am *very* interested in your tools and the likes.""  
  
Captain Moore peered inside and saw familiar tall shapes towering over the vast trees in the distance. ""How?""  
  
""I *know* and *see* much.""  
  
Instead of asking more questions, Captain Moore motioned for his men to proceed before turning to Caelu. ""Are you coming with us?""  
  
Caelu turned around and glanced at the Grand Elder before turning back. ""I think that might be best.""  
  
""It seems your destiny expands further than the reaches of our quaint village, Caelu,"" the Grand Elder stated while Captain Moore and Caelu walked towards the portal. ""I will pray upon Tesa for your safe return. May you experience the joys of the outside world and avoid its horrors.""  
  
""I will pray for your health, Grand Elder."" Caelu bowed and briskly walked through the magical doorway.  
  
The captain also bowed his head. ""Thank you for your hospitality and assistance.""  
  
""Of course. Do return soon with more things from your world. I expect great things through our *partnership*. But do remember, our Symbol of Friendship only lasts if we work together and do not *betray* each other.""  
  
Those final words left Captain Moore with a strange chill in his blood, though he hardly had time to consider as they promptly arrived at Fort Colossus.  
  
+++++  
  
""So you're telling me that one of those elves can just *waltz* in here, completely disregarding our defenses? Then what the hell were they digging those tunnels for?""  
  
Lieutenant Colonel Turner chewed on his gum incessantly and took off his cap to scratch his head as Captain Moore remained nearby with Lieutenant Li and Caelu. They were at the meeting place where the captain had met with other company leaders just days prior. Despite his position as XO, Lieutenant Doe was elsewhere with First Sergeant Wilard to prepare Bravo Company for its next assignment.  
  
An assignment that command believed Bravo Company was uniquely suited for, considering their previous mission and their 'extraterrestrial' attache.  
  
""Magic involving long-distance travel is extremely taxing and requires an enormous amount of magic, usually enough to *kill* those that are not sages,"" Caelu answered. ""I believe the Grand Elder was allowing the elders to act upon their own will until he came to a final decision.""  
  
""Anything to know about this ""Grand Elder?"""" Lieutenant Colonel Turner asked. ""I know you're going to write your report later, but I would also like a heads up.""  
  
""There's something off about him. Not really sure *what,* though,"" Captain Moore said.  
  
Caelu sighed. ""He's a sage. All of them are 'off,' as you may say.""  
  
""Right, immortal, lots of magic,"" Lieutenant Li said. ""He seemed very curious about our technology.""  
  
Captain Moore tapped his fingers on the table irritatingly. ""*And* seemed like a warmonger that wanted to use our technology for his own conquests.""  
  
""That as well.""  
  
""Hold the phone. Lots of magic? Immortal? Warmonger? *What*?"" Lieutenant Colonel Turner exclaimed.  
  
""A sage tends to be more inclined towards… aggressive tendencies. They sacrifice their soul for the pursuit of magic. Immortality is only a byproduct, though it is a terrible curse as a gift. As time passes, their... *mortality* is stripped away. It seems the Grand Elder is very much the same,"" Caelu stated.  
  
""Did something happen between you and the Grand Elder?"" Captain Moore asked. ""You're usually a bit more reserved about mentioning things regarding your tribe or its secrets.""  
  
""As our two tribes have signed a Symbol of Friendship, and the Grand Elder has approved of your tribe, I see no reason to hold back any longer.""  
  
There was something behind those words that Captain Moore sensed to be false, especially when Caelu's face twitched when speaking of the Grand Elder. Her previous reactions in the Grand Elder's presence also prompted some understanding on his part.  
  
Before continuing his conversation with his superior, Captain Moore switched to English. ""Right. So… I *was* going to recommend him as threat level Charlie, but Delta might be more apt.""  
  
""Delta?"" Lieutenant Colonel Turner asked. He still looked a bit miffed at the words exchanged in his presence, though he shifted in his seat and sat up straight at the captain's words. ""Is that…""  
  
""I think it might be necessary.""  
  
Before landing on Roana, the peacekeepers had been briefed on the expected 'threat levels' of various creatures and sapient beings across the planet.  
  
Alpha being the lowest, while Delta being the highest.  
  
The divine were… on another level entirely. And they could not be feasibly tracked.  
  
""Isn't he… well, friendly? Despite the whole 'warmonger' bit?""  
  
""That bit doesn't *worry* you?""  
  
""It does, but the last thing the general or the others want is to provoke our only contact and ally in this world.""  
  
Captain Moore sank back into his seat. ""He wants to use as a mercenary army and conquer the ancient elven homeland or whatever else he wants. The trouble is, he thinks Tesa ordained our arrival, and he seems keenly interested in our weapons. I don't think a powerful guy like him will take ""no"" as a serious answer, especially when he thinks it's a mission given to him by a *god*.""  
  
""What about that prophet kid? Can't that Chiu kid talk to Tesa and tell the Grand Elder off?""  
  
""I don't think Tesa *will* tell him off 'cause the god seemed pretty adamant about war from that time we saw him. Not to mention, Chiu was dragged off to god knows where.""  
  
""... Duly noted. I'll make sure to report it to command after this and brief the new team heading to that village.""  
  
""Who's going?""  
  
""A Chinese team. Lieutenant Li will still be with you, so don't you worry about that.""  
  
Lieutenant Li glanced off to the side and hummed, earning a side eye from Captain Moore.  
  
Lieutenant Colonel Turner cracked open a can of instant coffee and sighed. ""What a goddamn mess. We'll make contingency plans regarding the teleportation bit and other feats of magic. I'm assuming he's close to Tesa regarding raw power?""  
  
""*Definitely* on a similar scale, even if he denies it. He's been alive for a few centuries at least.""  
  
""I'm sensing another headache coming. Thank god for cigs and coffee… But for your next assignment. Since you're the resident 'extraterrrestrial' negotiator and already been through this rodeo once, the general wants you out there again dealing with the next group.""  
  
""The group from the Duchy,"" Captain Moore said.  
  
A picture appeared on the far wall through the projector. It displayed about a hundred medieval soldiers, the majority of whom were lightly armored foot guards, a mix of heavily armored knights, and three robed individuals on horses.  
  
The footguards were dressed in chainmail and spears, and a select few carried shields and swords. Several of them carried banners. One of the most distinct ones was a large banner with the image of some strange… black beetle-looking monster on a bold red background.  
  
The banner that flew the highest over the group was the picture of a… mix of a dragon and tiger with six limbs and two giant horns. A single golden crown was perched between its horns, while its paws held various weaponry: an axe, a sword, a spear, a bow, a mace, and a hammer.  
  
The red creature was reaching for the sky in the banner, and the black and silver backdrop emphasized the fierce crimson beast glowing in the center.  
  
""The banner of the *Unitary*,"" Caelu growled. ""bɒmn ƨɔum.""  
  
""Close, Ms. Caelu. They are technically *a vassal* of the Unitary. However, these are the local troops. As you can see, the Duchy has decided to throw us a surprise visit,"" Lieutenant Colonel Turner said, waving his hand at the image. ""It seems like they hate having new neighbors. If it wasn't clear to you, we have strong suspicions that those cloaked people are well… magicians, wizards, mages, whatever you want to call them.""  
  
""I believe the Grand Elder mentioned that earlier,"" Lieutenant Li interjected. ""What, the communion of two divines in a short amount of time in a specific place has attracted every mage and sage in the area?""  
  
""And *when* were you going to mention this?""  
  
Captain Moore coughed. ""We were preoccupied with some… magic and shenanigans. Though, the fault remains with me. I will make sure to clarify my oversight in the report.""  
  
""Not all of the blame falls upon the captain. I believe I am also at fault,"" Lieutenant Li said. He adjusted his uniform and folded his hands on the table. ""Since I *also* had a radio and the repeater needed to use it underground. If you will punish him, I believe it is only fair that I am reprimanded as well.""  
  
The response prompted the captain to raise his eyebrow, though his Chinese counterpart only offered a subtle smirk.  
  
""Fine, whatever. The last thing I want is to write more paperwork to the *Chinese* side of all things. I've seen your bureaucracy, *sheesh*. Cover it up for all I care. We would've seen them with drones anyways, *which we did*,"" Lieutenant Colonel Turner emphasized, throwing his hands at the image again. ""The important bit is that they're due to reach the eastern edges of the forest within a day.""  
  
""And you want Bravo Company to intercept, preferably away from the forest,"" Captain Moore replied.  
  
""That was our deal with Tesa, so yes.""  
  
""You think things will get out of hand?""  
  
""Do I *hope* that things will go tits up? No. Do I *think* it will? Considering what has happened to this god… scuse me, *gods* forsaken planet? Yes. Which is why you'll have air assets on stand-by, and the Third Marine Recon Force will be nearby in wait.""  
  
""Noted.""  
""Anywho, I'm just the messenger for today. I have enough meetings and reports to last me a *lifetime*.""  
  
""Why just Bravo Company? Why not a full battalion?""  
  
Lieutenant Turner stared at him incredulously. ""We're trying *not* to fight them. Do you think they would react calmly or with extreme fear and suspicion if a thousand soldiers popped out of the woods?""  
  
""... Point taken.""  
  
""Besides, your unit has already taken the insanity in stride. Plus, you have Caelu with you.""  
  
The elf was drifting off in her seat when her name was called. Like an embarrassed student caught by a teacher, Caelu stood up and waved awkwardly. ""Hello!""  
  
""What can go wrong?""

But I worked at Hartford Hospital late 90's (1998ish).  It was one of my first ""big girl"" jobs.  I remember this diner on the first floor of the hosptial that to this day I can literally smell.  In this day and age, it actually shocks me that this place existed in a hospital.

I remember it feeling like a total dive of a diner.  IN a HOSPITAL on the FIRST FLOOR.  AND LORD that food was incredible.  It was greasy.  The fries, the sandwiches, the soup, the coffee.  I would literally pay for a flight to Hartford right now just to go eat that incredible food.  The sweet lady that worked in the kitchen.  Everything about that place was an absolute gem.

I don't remember the name of this place, and am out of contact with anyone that I worked with back then, but please tell me.....does someone remember this place?

The sheer drop into the void. Massive holes in that map that lead to nothingness with a kill barrier at the bottom.  
I've been part of the community since Update 2 and have followed the game almost from it's inception in early access all the way through till now.   
  
I was building a frame like grid atop the world overseeing everything, looking out over the vast oceans at their sheer drop, like the planet had a giant natural dam, and it got me thinking about how something like that could form.

Initially I thouhgt a race of aliens had been there before we arrive. That would explain the limestone coated honeycomb curves seen all around the map and even in the distance off map.    
  
But the water flows down, into the void - And at the rate it gushes, surely water levels would drop to the point it wouldn't anymore, unless like a water bubbler it's recycled.

If Massage (AB)b was a donut shaped planet, the gravitational pull if strong enough could cause that water flowing off the world to crash into the ground of the other side of the planet. like the bottom of a waterfall - rotated 90 degrees. Anyway, some googling revealed a donut planet or a toroid planet is apparently scientifically possible, however incredibly unlikely.

Of course, we'd have landed on a continent on the outer side, because we don't see the planetfolding in on itself in the sky.   
  
Nor could we be inside the ring of it, otherwise there's be some indication like in the Halo franchise.  
But there are a lot of things that would set the Halo Rings and Massage (AB)b apart.   
On one hand, the halo rings were artificial structures. And if it weren't for the curved ""bones of the planet"" I could say with certainty Massage (AB)b appears to be completely natural.

I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it (I'm definately overthinking it)

1g0ybn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askapsychologist/comments/1g0ybn7/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"📌Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My boyfriend (he is on autistic spectrum, maybe this information can be relevant here) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me, (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. 

I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk.

 I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 

He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

⬇️Phrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""

Fistula:
25(M), I had been diagnosed with a fistula since about 7 years ago. It started as a small lump near my anus area. During this time, I did my research and found out about a condition called ""Fistula"". I ignored this lump because I was on a phase and age where I don't take medical conditions seriously. After few months or a year later, that lump turned into a hole which secretes a fluid. I did a checkup with a general surgeon and he confirmed it was a fistula and said it needed a surgery because if unleft treated, possible other tunnel will be created and it will be more complicated to handle. I kept that in mind but at the same timeI ignored it since my fistula during that time was not severe and I did not feel and pain whatsoever aside from the smelly fluid it produces. I was also afraid of the surgery also with the money it will involve. Life is hard, I live in a 3rd world country. Then as years pass by, perhaps 1-2 years. When my fistula produces liquid it also comes with a pain so severe that you just want to lay on a bed and automatically cry up until the pain subsides. I still chose to endure it since it is tolerable enough. It is gradually getting more painful as the years pass by. Fast forward 2024, the pain is now almost unbearable. (Let me provide a scale on how painful it is. Early years 3/10 to 5/10 to present year 2024 it turns into 9/10 and this was the point that I needed to go to the bathroom every hour due to how severe the pain and how constant fluid is getting out of my fistula external hole) Unlike before, it also now produces blood so by this time I am literally alarmed. Thankfully my work this time provided a benefit which they could cover the cost of my surgery. Mind you that I was afraid of the surgery but the pain coming from the fistula now outweighs my fear on the surgery. Took a break for a month on my work. August 10, 2024. A different but good general surgeon did a Fistulotomy to me. He found out that my fistula is now so complicated, so many tunnels is now visible. He had done so many incisions to let it heal on its own. 

Fistulotomy recovery:
I was about 3 days in the hospital because my surgeon suggested that the surgery should be done as an inpatient. The surgical area is about 3-4 inches in length (yeah lol)

1st day post op: My life had changed, there was no unbearable pain anymore. Did a lukewarm sitz bath as advised by my surgeon and eaten high fiber foods.

2nd-3rd day: There was no pain whatsoever perhaps due to the medications that I was prescribed with and continued sitz bath for 3x a day. (Sitz bath does a pressure on my surgery area thats why I am partly hesitant. But I did trust the process and it helped. But be advised that this is a case to case basis) On the 3rd day I pooped and surprisingly no pain at all.

1st-2nd week: Did eat a high fiber diet as much as possible and did 3x sitz bath a day. Fluid coming out of the surgical area is a lot.

3rd week: Did go back to my work and sitting was a bit of uncomfortable. Still was not able to sit for long hours. Still continued sitz bath for atleast twice a day.

And this was my mistake. I expected that during the 3rd week, my incision site will be mostly healed already but please do take your time to let your wound heal. Every week I am expecting for it to be healed already and I was just getting disappointed because of how limited I can do. But that is part of the process, take your time. At least, now that inconvenient unbearable pain is no more.

Almost week 9 now (2months): Sometimes when I sit, I feel a pressure buildup around my surgical area and yeah it' still not fully healed. I still do sitz bath 2-3x a day and it's true. Sitz bath will be your best friend especially when you feel a pressure on the surgical area and when its sometimes painful. There is still fluid coming out, when I sit prolong hours it produces a mild to modern amount of fluid (white to slight yellowish in color with no bad smell). Even if you are not sitting and just laying in bed it still produces fluids but around this time I think of it as normal because when that fluid does not come out. I feel a lot of pressure so I take that as a good sign and part of the healing process.

I think it will still take 2-3 months more before I could go back 100% because now I am atleasy at 60-70% but again. I am fistula pain free now and the best thing I did is to decide that I needed a surgery. So if you are diagnosed with a fistula. Do it ASAP to avoid further complications. It will be worth it.

Recovery tips:
1. Sitz bath is a MUST. 2-3x a day 15-20 mins. Pat dry the area using clean towel.
2. Avoid spicy food as it will irritate the surgical area.
3. Coffee and Milktea is fine as said by my surgeon if you are hesitant to drink this. But I still advise to avoid this atleast in the first month.
4. I always take multivitamins + vitamin c with zinc (not 100% sure that it promotes healing but its better than nothing)
5. I used a gentle cleanser to clean my surgical area. Today I am using cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and its haven.
6. Please do not abuse your body during its healing process. Avoid physical activities.
7. Take your time, trust the process. It will surely take time but all will be well. And we will surely be 100% fistula free ❤️

They also published an audio edition of the writer read the articles. Back when I actively learn English, it was one of my most favorite materials. I have a fond memory of enjoying learning the language and knowledge from it.  Just hearing the intro music can bring me back to the time. Today, I want to write about what I find it’s interesting—Empty Cups on TV.

It always bothers me when I noticed the actors from a TV show or a movie drink from an empty cup of coffee. Ever since I noticed it the first time, I can instantly catch it when I see it. And it is everywhere—from TV series to big production Hollywood movies. 

It seems to me they don’t even try to hide it. That part is incomprehensible to me. You would think those A-list actors would at least act like it when putting down a cup of hot, full coffee on the table.  No, they just heavily put on the wood table with a clear pop sound. It’s disrespectful to the audience. They only put liquid in the cups if it involves spilling. 

Naturally, not only did I test if I could pretend to down a cup of coffee on the table carefully(yes, it is totally doable), I searched online for answers. I was glad to find out it bothers other people, too. According to the answers from the comments section, there are many reasons but none of them make sense to me. (Please google it if you are interested. I cannot explain well enough and it will make this writing too long and too boring.) My humble request to anyone works in the industry: If the actors or actresses fail to perform the simple physics, please just put some cool water in the cups.

A few days ago, I found out one of my English tutors is also a movie director. I brought up this topic to him, and fortunately, he said he always put liquid in the cup for his film. It also bothers him to some degree when he saw empty cups in the movies. 

Well, from now on, I am going to focus on the opposite, whether they put liquid in the cup or actors made effort to convince me. You know, half full/half empty of water thing. I have to focus on the bright side. At least a *few* people care. ",1,1728608605.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

I am 5""11"", well educated and I keep in shape with a mix of things like the gym, swimming and I like hiking now and again. Currently building out a campervan in my rav4 to travel and live in as I work remote so trying to make the most of it.

I am in a good place career wise, been pretty ambitious my whole life and worked pretty hard to get where I am now. Currently living in Alberta, moved here from the UK back in 2022. I travel to the states for work every couple of months as well. I do not really feel tied down right now where I live. I have done a lot of traveling in the past, did a roadtrip around Iceland and been to a few different states.

I would say I am a homebody at heart, I volunteer with cats in my spare time. Been addicted to OSRS again but I also like going out to eat, currently got back into reading at coffee places. I enjoy trying different cuisines as well and chilling on my sofa watching the odd show if I have not already spoiled it for myself already through YouTube clips. Tried a few different things in the past likes streaming, making my own video game on Unity but ADHD (officially diagnosed) stops me in my tracks after a bit. I also put a lot of effort making good food as well.

Looking for someone to share experiences with and just enjoy life, feel like I have reached where I need to be in life and I am ready to share that with someone. I am the kind of person that prefers a small group of friends but they are also the ones you can trust and talk too about anything. I enjoy social settings in small doses, I go through phases where I can be around groups of people now and again but other times I can stay at home for days on end and I would just talk to my cat instead if I had one.

I will say I am obsessed with cats but I am not a dog person.

I picked up Monster Hunter World/Iceborne during a Steam sale a while back. Before Rise even, I believe. Could not get into it. Just wasn't clicking, as I am much more a skill tree RPG type of player. Dropped it for a bit. 

Then my wife decided, at 40 and us with two elementary age children, to go back to nursing school. Cool. I know she can do it. She's smart and determined. 
That leaves me with the kids most of the time, then time free when she is studying when I am not at my career. So, lots more free time. What do I do? Try and be supportive to her goal of course! Bringing coffee, snacks, whatever, just to show I am being supportive. To the point she wanted to strangle me because I was interrupting her train of thought. Needed to back off a bit. 

So, now more free time. I don't want to play Skyrim for the 5th time, or W3 for the 4th. Hey, what about that monster killing game?

So back to MHWI I went. Picked a new main weapon, the Almighty Lance, and started over. Now I got it. I help my wife when she needs, and some of the other times killing monsters. 
I see a great deal on Rise/Sunbreak, and pick it up. My son and I slam through it on his summer break from school. Great time together. 
Now I am back to Iceborne, trying to beat Shara to really get through to the endgame, all the while providing the more timely support to the wife. She is grateful I found an outlet that allows me to be close and bond with my son, while not consuming ALL of my time. 

That miracle is really down to all of you. I have been around the internet for a long time, and nowhere have I found a better community of people being supportive than the hunters. Every stumbling block, every skill wall, every completely unexplained Capcom mechanic, you folks have been there and helped. 

So, as my wife is finishing up her last classes this quarter, I wanted to thank all of you. You helped me find new games I absolutely love, and helped me help my wife get through this stressful bust time. 

So, just....

I am traveling solo to Guatamala next Feb/March and staying for a little over a week. I live in the US, but I grew up in Philippines. I am likely spending most of my time in Antigua and Flores/Tikal touring Mayan sites, historical areas, and climbing Acatenango. My main focus is to eat and drink (coffee) well, take lots of architectural and landscape photos, learn about some history, and maybe spot some wildlife / birds. 

I have a few questions about how best to go about this:

- From what I see, it's better off to fly via Avianca to Flores, but if I were to head to Mexico (ideally Merida) after Guatemala, is it worth flying TAP to Merida over Avianca to Cancun (then making my way to Merida)

- Is Lake Atitlan worth a visit? It seems a quite challenging to get to and landscape wise reminds me of some lakes back home. There are a few interesting properties that seem quite unique right by the water..

- Which tour operator/guides would you recommend for Acatenango and Fuego for *2 nights*? I only see Old Town Outfitters as a two night option, while most other operators like V Hiking or Ox Expeditions squeeze both the Acatenango ascent and Fuego hike into one day. I think my body could handle it, but I would rather spend another night in Acatenango to get myself more rest and photo opportunities. 

- Which coffee farms/tours would you recommend? I'm not interested in the ones that roast themselves, but more so would show how they cultivate, harvest, and process beans prior to roasting.

I promise I've done my best to google and search a few of these things, but I can't find websites or threads that would have helped me answer these. Perhaps it's because I can only rely on English resources. If you read this or commented below, thank you so much! I can't wait to visit Guatemala",1,1728607545.0,guatemala,0,1.0,False
