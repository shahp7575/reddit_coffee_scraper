1lw3mtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyfacereads/comments/1lw3mtt/i_discovered_a_book_in_my_library_that_seems_to/,I Discovered A Book In My Library That Seems To Predict The Deaths Of My Friends And Family. Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man"".

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1752121465.0,creepyfacereads,0,1.0,False

1lw3ln9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHICubs/comments/1lw3ln9/a_thought_about_ian_happ_and_i_guess_onkc/,A thought about Ian Happ (and I guess ONKC),"Just wanted to put my thoughts out there about Ian Happ amid some recent struggles, as well as see the thoughts of others. Will probably be my first extensive reddit post

We're only 9 days into July so it's not a huge sample size at all (though following the loss to the twins tonight the cubs have played on 8 of those days,) Ian Happ batting average for the month begins with a zero. Batting average is batting average and obviously he is not going to sustain that level of bad throughout an entire 31 day July (still gets on base too,) but it is concerning that the cubs leadoff batter has looked the coldest this series on an already struggling offense.

He started the season off pretty solid, being the kind of set up man for the offense to drive in runs in april when we were cooking with gas as an offense. Happ then gets injured in May and is sidelined for over a week. He comes back and is pretty cold, but everyone knew he was eventually going to find his groove again after shaking off the rust. When we hit june he caught fire in a big way. He starts slugging like a maniac by his standards (hits 9 of his 12 home runs in June.) Now it feels like he's kind of stagnated back to that immediate post injury slump, but he's obviously not coming off an injury.

Of course Ian Happ has still seems to have been een Ian Happ with the glove, the one that has been painted gold 3 times over (maybe a 4th on the way?) It seems Counsell still wanted to have him focus on hitting today and started him at DH, sending Seiya out there into left field instead. Yet even with the reduced workload he still ends up 0-4 and got K'd twice. In an offense that for some reason has looked poor as a whole against some not outstanding Twins pitchers, it just seems to stand out more. Top of the order coming up in a close game looking to start a rally and then it kinda just... doesn't happen (top of order includes more then just Happ but he is #1)

I will admit, I am a younger fan, to the point where I have watched more cubs seasons with Ian Happ on our roster then I have before he was on the roster, so I could just be overblowing all of this and this could just be chalked up to a heat of the moment rant. I also of course love Ian Happ for what he has been to this organization and team for this post world series era, and am in no way suggesting we do anything rash with him that takes him away from the team

But I wanna throw out a little hypothetical

The Cubs top prospect is an outfielder by the name of Owen Cassie, I'm sure he needs no introduction. The likely prevailing reason as to why he hasn't even seen a cup of coffee in Chicago is because of the outfield logjam that consists of 2 all star starters and the aforementioned Ian Happ, plus Seiya obviously being able to play the outfield should one of those guys (god forbid) get injured like Happ did earlier in the season. 

Cassie has been absolutely obliterating minor league competition for the last week or so, the power is extremely promising. He also has predominantly played Right field with a handful at Left (I'm getting there) and some dh. He very likely isn't going to improve as a baseball player much more in triple-A, where he spent all of last year and all of this year thus far. I feel like he's earned a cup of coffee, but how would that even be possible?

Maybe Ian Happ is dealing with something injury wise? He obviously hasn't looked himself as of recent. Perhaps a small break from starting every day would do him some good. This is where Cassie ties in. I do not know if the cubs see a future that involves Owen Caissie being a starter in the foreseeable future, when you factor in things like ""Will Kyle Tucker be extended?"" Because if the answer to that question is yes, whatever that ends up being years wise, plus having Pete in the center until 2030 at the absolute minimum, a 23 year old Caissie is kind of stuck UNLESS we keep him until Happ is a free agent in 2027 when Cassie will turn 25. 

So what im saying is, perhaps calling up Caissie to at the very least get him some major league at bats to develop at this level and give Happ a small break, idk if that would require an IL stint, or if Ian would even be willing to accept that, but like i said, this is an unlikely hypothetical. 

Also factoring this into the trade deadline, if Owen shows enough promise at the big league level to convince another organization that they could invest into him as a future every day big league player at the worst, and would be willing to part with a good stating pitcher for him + some other assets, I feel like the cubs, who are trying to go for it all this year with Kyle Tucker on a 1 year deal plus the PCA breakout, would take a deal like that for a solid pitcher IF the cubs do not extend Tucker (sounds unlikely but I like to be optimistic.) If they did that trade and then did not extend tucker, unless they win the world series, the likely regression in outfield play would probably not be worth it. If they did not keep Tucker and kept everything else as is, I fully expect Owen would be your staring right fielder come March 2026 after 2 years of triple A ball. 

Either way, the team can benefit as a whole from calling up caissie and giving Ian Happ a chance to reset. Either to play left field or to put sezuki out there and put Owen at DH, I just feel like his bat could not be worse then Happ's is right now, and maybe he plays himself into some increased trade value that turns into a good starting pitcher to insert into this rotation for this team that is swinging for the fences literally and metaphorically. 

Boy, that's a lot of words! This basically ended up being a rant about Happ's recent struggles and how it ties into maybe one of the only scenarios that Owen Caissie plays for the cubs big league roster. Maybe this post ended up being too long and could get taken down, idk. Either way I hope it was a thought provoking read, and feel free to leave any type of thoughts on it.

1lw3keu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lw3keu/i_discovered_a_book_in_my_library_that_seems_to/,I Discovered A Book In My Library That Seems To Predict The Deaths Of My Friends And Family. Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man.""

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1752121245.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

***Wednesday***

While he waited for Sam to call back, Tucker used the landline on his desk to call Colton Shaw, his CTO.

“Shaw,” Colton said, his voice crisp and no-nonsense. Clearly, he hadn’t looked at the Caller ID, though his irritation was a surprise. Not that Tucker couldn’t handle an abrupt attitude — it just didn’t usually come from Colton. He was a beefy guy but known as the company teddy bear for a reason.

“Is everything alright, Colton?” Tucker asked, concern for his friend trumping business.

“Oh, yes … sorry.” He then contradicted that by yawning. “A couple of late nights, and I’m not exactly in my twenties anymore. What’s up?”

Tucker wasn’t about to let that slide. “Is Phillipa still giving you trouble?” If she was — and this was the first he was hearing of it — heads would roll.

“No … not directly, no,” he hedged. “A lot of people are taking an interest in Phillipa, and I’m putting out the fires as fast as they pop up.”

“Isn’t that what you have a team for?”

“Not when Max is in the centre of it, no.”

*Ahhhh. Yes, that changed the game.* “Do they need more people over there?”

“Honestly, I’m not sure. There’s a player involved that doesn’t normally belong in corporate business. The Nascerdios sent her in undercover, and she’s hooked up with one of our field operatives temporarily.”

Tucker frowned. “And it never occurred to you to forward this information to me, why?”

“With all due respect, Tucker, fuck you. My kid has been playing in the same pool as a goddamn world-class assassin, and I do not need your attitude right now!”

Tucker’s jaw hit the ground as fear for Phillipa swept over him. “The Nascerdios sent in an assassin?”

“Not directly it seems, no. But we only found that out a couple of hours ago after tearing things apart all night, trying to find the connection.”

Anger quickly replaced Tucker’s fear. “Okay, I need you to get your ass in here and tell me exactly what’s been going on in LA.”

“On my way. Would you mind getting me some serious coffee while you wait? The blacker and thicker, the better.”

“Fine.” As soon as he hung up though, the cell phone in his other hand began ringing. “Sam,” he said because after having a mental swipe at Colton about checking the Caller ID, he wasn’t about to be caught not doing it himself. “How’d you go?”

“Not great. My roommate’s not in a good headspace right now either and anything tied to this’ll hurt him more than it helps Melody. But I was thinking — if money’s what they need, Gerry and I can send it to help the family through this and keep you out of it.”

Tucker winced, for although it was a solid plan, it was still imperative that he be the one to support it.

“Unless this isn’t about helping Melody’s family as much as placating whatever sense of guilt you have over what happened, in which case you could make a donation to something that will help others instead.”

Tucker breathed out deeply, wondering when in the world Sam had become so … authoritative. “I let that family down badly, Sam. When they asked me for help, I prioritised my own over them.”

“As you should.”

“Not when it’s a member of my family being the monster.”

Sam went quiet for a second, then barely whispered, “You’ve got more than one on that score, sir.”

Which meant Gerry was close by. Close enough to hear Sam, but not him. “Keep my daughter safe and happy, Sam. Whatever else, promise me that much.”

“With all that I am, sir.”

As his door opened and Colton walked in, Tucker quickly said, “I have to go now, Sam. Give Gerry my love, and I’ll talk to you later.”

“Goodbye, Mister Portsmith.”

Had Colton not been crossing the room towards him, Tucker would’ve corrected Sam’s use of his surname. As it was, he hung up and pocketed his phone.

Colton looked like crap. In fact, crap would’ve been an improvement. His suit was technically immaculate (because Naomi would never have let him walk out of the house that morning looking anything less), but his eyes were bloodshot, and his skin had a pallor that was more pronounced than his usual computer-oriented self allowed.

The man searched the tabletop as he dropped his weight into Tucker’s visitor’s chair. “Where’s my damn coffee?” he demanded, meeting Tucker’s gaze with a cranky one of his own.

Tucker held up one finger, then used it to signal his Executive Assistant outside on the intercom.

“Yes, Mister Portsmith?”

“Have someone bring up a large black, double—*triple…”* he amended in compromise when Colton held up four fingers. “…espresso for Mister Shaw.”

“Right away, sir.”

Tucker then stood up and went around to the front of his desk, leaning back on the edge. He held the ledge on either side of his hips and crossed his ankles, going for a relaxed look that would help hopefully settle his friend’s agitation. “What the hell’s going on, Colton?”

Colton’s eyes took on a haunted look. “I’ll tell you right now, if I’d have known when Max wanted to transfer out to LA that this was in her future, I’d have transferred her to the fucking south pole instead.”

The swearing only went to show how frazzled and tired he was. “She *is* safe though, isn’t she?”

Colton doubled forward, resting his forearms on his knees. “Apparently,” he said into the ground. Then he looked up. “But your friends, the Nascerdios, certainly know how to put a cat the size of a sabretooth tiger amongst the pigeons.”

Tucker stared at him for a long beat, then reached back to push the intercom once more.

“Yes, Mister Portsmith?”

“Clear my schedule for the next two hours. Bring in the coffee when it arrives, and let no one else in until you hear from me.”

“Yes, sir.”

“I mean no one, this time. I don’t care if it’s the President of the United States. We are *not* available.”

“Yes, sir.”

He then pulled himself upright and waved for Colton to follow him over to the more comfortable three-seater sofa to one side of his office, sliding down into the corner that faced the doors. Colton followed suit at the other end, and the vibe shifted from professional to personal just like that. “Start at the beginning,” Tucker said, and Colton nodded.

It was over an hour and a half and two more coffee runs (which Tucker joined him on, even though Colton went for more triple espressos since Tucker wouldn’t let him have quadruples) before Colton laid bare everything that was going on over in Los Angeles.

“Jesus Christ,” Tucker swore at the end, and Colton slid down the seat to rest his head in the corner.

“Yup,” he agreed, closing his eyes. “I thought my days of working all night were behind me, and today’s certainly telling me they should be. I can barely make a cohesive sentence, and God knows what the hell I’ve been typing all day.”

Given the man had been mainlining caffeine since he walked in and still looked like shit, Tucker asked, “What’s on your books for the rest of the afternoon?”

“I still have to…” Colton paused and scrubbed both hands over his face to leave them hooked over the top of his head to stare at the ceiling. “God, where do I even start?” He dropped his arms with a thud against the back and arm of the sofa and started counting off on his fingers, voice cracking with sheer fatigue.

“I’ve gotta finalise the server migration and check the audit files for compliance gaps,” —one finger rolled upwards— “Chase the idiots dragging their feet on the Q2 security audit before Legal has a collective aneurysm,”—second finger— “Hand-hold the biometrics team through the last twenty percent of the rollout, because God forbid anyone should read the instructions anymore,” —third finger— “I’ve got a teleconference with Washington over the specs of the HX33 *because again,* God forbid anyone reads the goddamn instructions anymore,” ­—fourth finger— “And I’ve still got to get Procurement to stop playing hot potato with the firmware contracts.”

He stared at his fingers for a beat, almost as if he’d forgotten where he was up to or why they were even upright. “Oh, and I’m supposed to renew about six dozen software licenses by tonight, but honestly, at this point, if the system wants to crash, I say let it crash. I need sleep.”

“On that one, we can agree,” Tucker said, taking a firmer role once more. “I’ll get R and D to pick up the Q2 audit, and any hassles they have, they can call me directly.” At Colton’s weary-yet-mocking stare, Tucker huffed, “I’m not so out of touch with things that I can’t lend a hand for one afternoon. Legal can handle the firmware contracts. I don’t know why you’re dealing with them in the first place.

“I’ll let Martin loose on the biometrics team. By the time he’s done tearing them up one side and down the other, they’ll be happy to sit down with you tomorrow and play ball.” That visual brought a weary smile to Colton’s lips. “And are any of those software licences going to expire before tomorrow?”

Colton shook his head.

“Good, then they can wait until you’re back too.”

“What about the teleconference and server migrations?”

“I’ll deal with the teleconference, and if you’re talking about Palerno Server, that one’s not going live until next week.”

“But I still need time to…”

“I’ll help you. It’ll be like old times.”

It just went to show how tired Colton was that he didn’t have his usual quip about having to carry Tucker’s supposed dead weight when it came to present-day technical capabilities.

Tucker was well aware that things had changed since the nineties, but he wouldn’t let his friend down. “Anything else?” he asked gently.

Colton peeled one bleary eye open. “Yeah. I need sleep. Sometime before I drop dead and Naomi kills you for being the last person to see me alive.”

Tucker chuckled and rose to his feet, gesturing for Colton to do likewise. “C’mon,” he said, putting a hand behind Colton’s shoulder once the man was upright to get him moving towards the door. “We kicked Pepper out last week for working herself into the ground, and I’ll be damned if I’m going to let you join her. Go home and crawl into bed. Turn your phone and alarms off and come back tomorrow morning. We’ll pick it up then.”

Colton raised one hand. “I’m happy to go home and sleep,” he countered. “But I’m not turning my phone off in case Max needs me.”

Tucker made a mental note to reach out to those operatives and order them not to contact the CTO for a full twenty-four hours. Maxine would agree if she’d seen the state of her father right then. “Done. Do you think you can make it to your car, or will I have one of these guys walk you down?” He gestured to the guards scattered around the room — guards Colton seemed to have only just noticed.

Colton tilted his head as if considering it. As all the executive officers had town cars and personal drivers, only Tucker (and now Phillipa) warranted extra security.  “Let me make the call first,” he said, delving in his breast pocket for his phone, only to realise it was in his hip pocket. “George, yeah. Change of plans. If you can bring the car around, I’m heading home. Good. See you then.”

After he pocketed his phone, his eyes suddenly widened. “Shit, I haven’t even locked up my office.”

“I’ll deal with that, too. For the love of God, go home and go to bed. You’re utterly useless to me right now.”

“Yeah, you’re probably right,” he yawned, heading for the door.

*No probably about it, old friend.*

1lw3h12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lw3h12/i_work_at_a_grocery_store_that_doesnt_take_cash/,I work at a grocery store that doesn't take cash (pt. 14),"I slid off my stool, the legs scraping against the linoleum with a dry squeal that felt too loud in the hush of the store.

I winced—but kept moving.

Slow. Natural. Calm.

Not too slow to draw attention. Not too fast to look like I was running.

My fingers brushed the edge of a shelf as I passed, grounding myself. Every step away from the counter felt like walking across a wire strung over something deep.

But I kept listening.

I was listening hard.

And then—

Mr. Stantsman’s voice.

It rose out of the silence like a hand sliding out from under a bed—quiet, patient, and far too close.

“Seems you can’t buy this with simple ones anymore,” he said, almost cheerfully.

That false, syrupy cheer—the kind that drips right before the trap springs shut.

“Used those up.”

The silence that followed felt… unnatural. Not just a pause.
A vacuum.

Like the air had been sucked out of the store.

I ducked behind an aisle near the back, heart hammering against my ribs. I could still hear them—voices carrying, soft and sharp, through the unnatural quiet.

“Let’s see…”

A pause.

Then I heard it.

A breath.
Long. Slow. Measured.

Like he was smelling something.
Savoring it.

“Tell me about your late mother, Mabel.”

My whole body tensed.

I grabbed the edge of a shelf to steady myself.

“Tell me a memory about her.”

He said it like it was nothing. Like he was asking about a favorite meal.
But I knew that tone—silk wrapped over bone. A cold hand behind a warm curtain.

He was starving.

I could feel it, somehow—radiating from him like heat off pavement.

And Mabel—

She was standing there, alone, holding out a memory like a lamb to a butcher.

I moved faster, slipping deeper into the store’s guts, heading for the back hallway. My pulse roared in my ears.

Because I knew what came next.

And I had to get there before he finished feeding.

I reached his office door, pulse thudding in my ears so loud it nearly drowned out the world.

It was open.

Just a sliver.
Just like before.

A crooked, silent invitation.
Or a trap.

I hovered in the hallway for a breath—maybe two—watching the way the shadows pooled in the crack between the door and the frame. The warm overhead lights from the store behind me didn’t reach in here. It was darker. Older.

This room hadn’t changed in decades.
But something inside it had.

I leaned in and pressed two fingers against the wood. It was smooth. Too smooth—like it had been sanded over and over, worn by years of people pushing through when they shouldn’t have.

Creeeak.

The sound was barely audible, but to me, it was deafening.

I froze.

Waited.

Nothing.

No footsteps. No sharp voice calling my name.
No hand reaching through the shadows to drag me back.

Just the soft, constant hum of the overhead lights buzzing down the hallway like a warning.

I slipped through the crack.

Inside.

The air hit me immediately—warmer, thicker than it had any right to be.
It clung to my skin. Smelled like parchment, dust, old perfume, and something else—

Sweet.
Too sweet.

Like rotting fruit sealed in a jar.

The office was exactly as I remembered—maybe exactly how it had always been.

Filing cabinets lined the far wall, tall and metal, their paint chipped and dulled to an ugly gray. Papers sat in impossibly neat stacks across every surface—organized not alphabetically, or chronologically, but by something else.

Emotion.
Weight.
Value.

His desk dominated the room—heavy wood, glossy with polish, carved at the edges in looping, foreign symbols I couldn’t quite make sense of. They seemed to shift if I looked too long.

A tall chair sat tucked neatly behind it. Still.
Waiting.

I moved slowly, avoiding every floorboard that looked like it might groan. Each step felt like I was walking across the chest of a sleeping animal.

My eyes never stopped moving—watching the door, the walls, the shadows.

I passed a filing cabinet on the right, the labels worn thin. No names. No numbers. Just strange little marks scratched into the edges. My fingertips hovered above one handle, hesitating.

Behind me, out in the store, I could still hear Mr. Stantsman’s voice—muffled but unmistakable.

He was still talking to Mabel. Still feeding.
Still distracted.

But that wouldn’t last forever.

I dropped into a crouch beside the cabinet.

This was it.

Somewhere in here—buried between forgotten names and stolen pasts—was the truth.

And if I didn’t find it soon…

He’d come looking.

I crouched beside the oldest-looking drawer—the one low to the ground, its handle worn smooth, a faint patina of rust creeping along the edges.

It looked like it hadn’t been opened in years.

Maybe longer.

I wrapped my fingers around the cold metal and pulled.

It stuck.

For a heartbeat, I panicked—afraid it would screech, that the metal would groan and give me away.

But then, with a soft shudder, it slid open.

Slow. Heavy. Quiet.

The air that wafted out smelled ancient—like old paper, mildew, and something else beneath it. Something sharp. Metallic.

Inside were rows of files.

Old.

Really old.

The folders were yellowed at the edges, curled like they’d been singed. Some were cracking apart at the creases, others patched with brittle tape that had long since dried and peeled. The paper felt like it would crumble if I breathed too hard.

Each tab was marked with neat, deliberate handwriting. Not typed. Not printed.

Written. In ink that had bled and faded over time.

Names. Some familiar. Most I didn’t recognize.

My hands moved carefully, reverently, like I was touching bones.

This wasn’t just a filing cabinet.

This was a graveyard.

And somewhere buried in here…
was his beginning.

The first deal.

The first memory devoured.

The moment Mr. Stantsman stopped being human.

I sifted slowly, fingertips brushing fragile paper, careful not to tear the edges. The files whispered against each other like dry leaves in the wind.

Name after name slid past me.
None familiar. Some long forgotten.
Some… too faded to read.

And then—

There it was.

Buried in the far back of the drawer, nearly swallowed by time and dust.

A folder thicker than the rest.

Its tab read, in looping, faded ink:
E. Stantsman

My breath caught.

The paper was darker than the others, yellowed almost brown. Water-damaged at the corners. The edges curled like they were trying to fold inward and hide themselves.

But the name was still clear.

E. Stantsman.

I stared at it, frozen.

This was it.

His beginning. His bargain.
The moment everything changed.

My fingers trembled as I reached for the folder, heart pounding in my throat.

Whatever was inside…

It wasn’t meant to be seen.
But I was going to see it anyway.

Just as my fingers closed around the folder, I heard her.

Mabel.

Her voice drifted faintly through the walls—muffled but trembling.

“My mother’s last words to me…” she was saying, slow and broken.
“Before she died… I’ll tell you that…”

She was acting.
But even knowing that, my blood ran cold.

It sounded too real.

Too raw.

I gripped the file tighter.

Time was unraveling.

I could feel it—slipping through my hands like sand. Every second Mabel held his attention was borrowed. Stolen. And the price for staying too long was higher than either of us could afford.

I slid the file from the drawer.

The paper inside crackled softly, ancient and delicate. I barely dared to breathe.

Then, fast but careful, I tucked it beneath my apron—pressing it flat against my stomach, hidden from sight. I'd slide it into my backpack the moment I got clear of the office.

My heart thundered.

I wasn’t ready to leave.

But I was out of time.

I pressed the drawer closed, inch by inch, the metal gliding with a low, reluctant sigh.

The file was tucked under my apron, pressing warm against my stomach like it could feel how badly it wasn’t supposed to be touched.

Don’t think. Move.

I turned and stepped out of the office, leaving the door slightly ajar—exactly as I’d found it. No change. No sign. Just shadows and stillness behind me.

The hallway stretched long and quiet, the fluorescent lights buzzing faintly overhead. My shoes whispered across the floor.

Every step sent a bolt of adrenaline through my spine.

Out in the front of the store, Mabel’s voice cracked through the silence again.

My chest tightened. Her voice was trembling. Too good.

I didn’t know how much longer she could hold him.

I passed the cleaning aisle, turned sharply at the end, and slipped through the swinging break room door without hesitation.

Cool air. Dim light. A breath I could finally take.

I didn’t stop moving.

In one smooth motion, I ducked into the corner, reached under my apron, and pulled the file free.

The paper crackled in my hands—fragile, ancient, electric.

I slid it deep into my bag, between an old sweater and my notebook, then zipped it shut.

Gone. Hidden. Mine.

Just then, the break room door creaked slightly behind me—someone moving nearby.

I didn’t flinch.

I grabbed a paper towel, turned to the sink, and began drying my perfectly dry hands.

Calm. Normal. Just another cashier on her break.

But inside?

Inside, I was vibrating.

Because I had it now.

And everything was about to change.

From the break room, I could still hear her.

Mabel’s voice.
Shaky. Measured. Wounded.

She was giving it her all.

“I never wanted you,” she said, voice thick like it hurt to say it.
“But you showed talent. And you made me money.”

My stomach turned.

It was too cruel. Too believable.

She was selling pain that wasn’t real—but it sounded real enough to bleed.

Then—
A sharp sound from the register.

Not the soft chime of payment accepted.
Not the calm red glow.

It was a buzz.
A harsh, metallic rejection.
Followed by a flash of dull white light.

Denied.

My blood went cold.

Then I heard it—
a low, inhuman growl.

Not just frustration. Not just anger.

Hunger. Denied.

Mr. Stantsman made that sound.

A warning. A wound.
He didn’t believe her.

I froze by the sink, hands still on the paper towel, every nerve on fire.

The bait had failed.
And now he was starving.

“MARIE!”

It wasn’t just a call—it was a howl, ragged and furious, echoing through the store like it didn’t come from a human throat at all.

I flinched, hard.

My heart slammed into my chest like it was trying to tear out. For a split second I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think.

Then I moved.

Fast. Scared. Exposed.

I shoved open the break room door and stepped into the store, blinking against the overhead lights that suddenly felt too bright, too sharp—like interrogation lamps.

He was already looking at me.

Mr. Stantsman.

Standing stiff behind the counter, one hand still resting near the register. His fingers were twitching.

His eyes—

His eyes were wild.

Black-rimmed. Burning.

The polite smile he always wore had twisted, split down the middle. What was left was a snarl—teeth bared like something hungry and cornered.

Mabel stood motionless beside the tin of coffee, her face drained of color, lips pressed into a thin line. She was still acting—but barely. Her eyes didn’t meet mine. She knew what this meant.

Mr. Stantsman’s voice dropped, and somehow that was worse.

“Handle her,” he hissed, each word thick with venom.
“She doesn’t want to cooperate.”

He didn’t wait for my answer. Didn’t trust himself to stay near.

He spun on his heel and stalked off, disappearing into the hallway near his office, the shadows swallowing him whole.

I couldn’t move.

I was still standing there, staring at where he’d vanished, my throat tight and dry, my legs heavy like stone.

The file in my bag felt radioactive.

Mabel slowly turned to me. Her hands were shaking.

“That was too close,” she whispered.

And she was right.

Because now he was watching.
Now he was listening harder than ever.
Now the game had teeth.

My thoughts spun fast, but I held onto the feeling—like I was circling something just out of reach.

We didn’t need much.
Just a crack in his focus.
A sliver of time.
Something that would draw his attention without setting off the alarm bells that lived behind his too-wide smile.

I stared down at my coffee, watching the steam curl and dance, fragile and vanishing. Like a thought. Like a memory.

Then it came to me.

Sharp. Clean. Perfect.

I looked up at Mabel, adrenaline rising like a tide under my skin. “You’re going to give him a memory,” I said, voice low, deliberate.

She blinked. “What?”

“One that hurts. One that sounds real. Something he'd drool over. The kind he can’t ignore.”

Her brow furrowed, suspicion and confusion fighting across her face.

“You want me to give him something?”

I nodded once.

“But not a real one.”

I leaned forward, dropping my voice.

“A bait memory. Something fake. Something heartbreaking. A lie dressed in pain. Say it like it matters. Make him want it.”

Mabel sat back slowly, her lips parting, eyes narrowing with understanding—and a flicker of fear.

A long pause passed between us.

Then she spoke. “And while he’s busy swallowing my story…”

I gave a single, steady nod.

“I’ll be in the back. Digging through those files. Finding out who he really was—before he became that.”

We had a plan.

And for the first time in what felt like forever, the pressure in my chest let up—just slightly. Like a window cracked open in a room that had been sealed shut for years.

The fear wasn’t gone. But it had shape now.
The unknown no longer felt like a void—it had a face, a weakness. A door I could maybe pry open.

The next time Mabel walked into that store, everything would start. I could already see it: her voice steady but heavy, laced with grief that wasn’t hers. 

Her eyes glassy, her tone trembling just enough to sell it. A perfect, crafted lie.
A memory he’d want to drink slowly.

He wouldn’t be able to help himself.

That thought sparked something deep inside me—not joy, not even relief. Just a flicker of warmth in the cold.
Hope.
Small, stubborn, and alive.

I reached for my mug and drank the last of the coffee in one hard gulp. It had gone cold. Bitter. But I barely tasted it. Didn’t matter.

I set the cup down gently, the ceramic clicking against the wood like punctuation. Then I looked at Mabel.

“We’ll only get one shot.”

She met my gaze, steady and calm.
“Then let’s make it count.”

I glanced up, eyes landing on the small clock hanging above Mabel’s stove. Its faded white face ticked steadily, the second hand dragging itself forward like it was tired of counting.

A little past 10 PM. Late.

I hadn’t realized how much time had passed. The night had crept in slow and quiet, wrapping itself around the house like a heavy quilt.

Outside, the world had gone still. No headlights. No voices. Just the kind of hush that presses against the windows.

Mabel’s eyes followed mine to the clock. “You should get home,” she said gently, voice almost a whisper.
“Before the streets get too quiet.”

I nodded, but my body didn’t move. Not yet. I hesitated. Just for a second.

Then I pushed back my chair and stood, the legs scraping softly against the kitchen floor. My body felt heavier than before, like the weight of what we were planning had finally settled into my bones.

I let out a quiet sigh.

Mabel didn’t say anything. She just moved to the back door and began undoing the locks—one by one. Each click echoed louder than it should have.

She opened the door just enough for me to slip through. “Be careful,” she murmured.

I gave her a small nod, the kind you give when you’re holding more than you want to say. Then I lifted my hand and waved once—just a flick of fingers in the glow of the kitchen light.

And stepped out. The night met me like cold breath. The screen door eased shut behind me, and the wooden door followed with a soft thud.

Then came the locks.

Click.
Thunk.
Clack.
Slide.
Snap.

I shook it off. The weight of everything. The quiet that clung too close. The feeling in my chest—that tight, whispering sense that something might still go wrong.

I pulled in a slow breath, slid my hands into my pockets, and started down the gravel path. Each step crunched softly behind me.

The hush of the night trailed close, like it didn’t want to let me go. But I didn’t look back. I just walked.

The road curled through the neighborhood in gentle bends, familiar and strange all at once. Under the thin spill of streetlight, the world looked washed out—like a photograph left too long in the sun. 

Most houses were dark. Shadows stretched long across lawns. A few windows pulsed faintly with the light of televisions, but no movement. No voices. No life.

Just me.
And the sound of my footsteps on the pavement. I turned the final corner—and there it was.

Home.

My house stood quietly at the end of the lane, just as it always had. But tonight, it looked softer. The porch light was on, casting a warm golden glow across the stairs and the faded welcome mat. Like it had been waiting for me.

Welcoming.
Comforting.
Safe.

I stepped onto the porch. The old wood creaked beneath my feet, but it didn’t startle me. It sounded like coming back to something that still remembered me. And for now, that was enough.

I stepped inside and shut the door behind me with a quiet click.

Then the locks—
One. Two. Three.
Not as many as Mabel had, but enough to feel like a barrier between me and everything that waited in the dark.

I kicked off my shoes by the mat, letting them land wherever they wanted. Shrugged off my bag and hung it on its hook, the strap sliding down with a tired sigh. I moved through the hallway on autopilot, straight into my room.

No light. I didn’t need it.

I dropped into bed, the mattress giving way beneath me with that deep, familiar softness that made my shoulders finally unclench. It didn’t just hold me—it caught me. Like something saying I’ve got you.

I reached for my blanket and pulled it up to my chin. It was big—oversized, warm, and impossibly soft. The kind of blanket you could disappear into. A thick, cloudlike thing with weight to it, like it was pressing the world out while keeping everything good in.

The fabric was velvety on one side, smooth like brushed fleece on the other. The inside was stuffed full, plush and dense, like it had been made for cold nights and heavy hearts.

It smelled like home. Like clean sheets and safety. I curled into it, tucked beneath its warmth like a secret. And for a moment—just a small, quiet moment—I didn’t feel watched.
I didn’t feel hunted.

I felt held.
And that was enough to let sleep start pulling at the edges of me. The next morning came fast—too fast.

One blink, and the night was gone.

The warmth of the blanket replaced by the dull blue-gray of early light creeping through my window. I barely remembered falling asleep.

And before I knew it, another shift had started. 

Same store. 
Same aisles.
Same flickering overhead lights humming faintly above.

But everything felt different now. Because this time, I had a purpose.

And if everything went according to plan…By the end of today, I might finally know who—or what—Mr. Stantsman really was.

The bell above the door jingled softly as I stepped inside, the sound too cheerful for how the air felt—stale, still, heavy like breath held too long.

The store looked exactly as it always did: aisles lined in eerie precision, labels facing forward like obedient little soldiers. The lights hummed faintly overhead.

Too quiet.
Too watched.

And there he was. Mr. Stantsman stood behind the counter, not moving, not blinking—just there. Like a fixture. Or a shadow waiting to shift.

His posture was perfect, back straight, hands folded neatly in front of him. He wore the same crisp button-up, the same off-colored tie, as though time never touched him.

I gave a small, cautious wave. He returned it with a smile—a thin, precise curve of his lips.

Not warm. 
Not human.

But it was his eyes that unsettled me most.

They flicked past my face.
Down to my hand.

The one I’d sliced open yesterday on a sharp bag seam. It should’ve been tender, raw, at least pink with healing. 

But it wasn’t.

The skin was smooth. Unbroken. Like it had never happened. His eyes lingered there a second too long.

“Marie,” he said, voice smooth as poured syrup.

“How are you feeling today?” He didn’t ask about the hand. 
He didn’t have to. His gaze had already done the asking.
Or the confirming.

Like he was checking in on something he hadn’t needed me to tell him. Like he’d felt it heal.

I swallowed hard, forcing a smile that didn’t quite reach my eyes. 
“Good,” I said, carefully. “I’m fine.”

But as I stood there beneath those humming lights, his eyes still fixed on me like he could see deeper than skin—I wasn’t sure I was telling the truth.

I barely had time to settle behind the counter, fingers brushing the edge of the register, before a voice cut through the quiet—

Soft.
Unsteady.
Almost afraid to be heard.

“Um… excuse me?”

I looked up.

A boy stood just inside the door, blinking against the glare of the overhead lights. He couldn’t have been more than eighteen, maybe nineteen. Shaggy dark hair hung over his forehead. A worn backpack clung to one shoulder. His hoodie was too thin for the morning chill, sleeves pushed up unevenly. 

He looked like someone in transit—half here, half not—trying to figure out where he belonged.

His hands were stuffed in his pockets. His posture said sorry before his mouth ever moved.

I just moved here,” he said, eyes flicking across the aisles. “I… I don’t really know where anything is yet.”

My heart jumped.

New?
Here?

My breath caught before I could hide it. He didn’t know.

He had no idea where he’d just stepped.

I opened my mouth—no words came.

And then, like smoke curling in from under a door, he was there.

Mr. Stantsman. 

One moment he was behind me, still, silent. The next, he was at the boy’s side.

Suddenly. He hadn’t walked. He hadn’t hurried. He’d appeared. One fluid, unnatural motion.

He slid his arm around the boy’s shoulders, a gesture that mimicked kindness—but felt too familiar.
Too practiced. 

“Well, well,” he said, voice warm and syrup-slick.

“A fresh face. We do love new beginnings here.”

His smile widened. “Let’s get you all settled, shall we?”

The boy nodded, uncertain but trying to be polite. His smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. Mr. Stantsman gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze.

A guiding nudge. 

And just like that, the boy was being led deeper into the store—aisles stretching like quiet jaws around them.

Like a wolf leading a lamb by the collar.

I stood frozen behind the till.
Hands still. 
Mouth dry. 
Watching the last bit of safety slip out of sight.

That tiny spark of hope I’d woken up with? It flickered. Then bent in the wind.

About twenty minutes later, they came back.

I heard them before I saw them—the low, rhythmic squeak of cart wheels and the quiet clink of glass jars nudging one another. A sound that should’ve been ordinary. But it wasn’t.Not now.

The boy pushed the cart with both hands, shoulders hunched slightly forward like he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to be here. 

The cart was overflowing—absurdly full. Stacks of canned beans, five bottles of dish soap, instant oatmeal, gauze pads, a family-sized bag of sugar teetering near the top. Items thrown together like someone had been told more is better, but not what to get.

None of it made sense.

And that made it worse. Mr. Stantsman followed just behind, his footsteps soundless, his expression unreadable. In his hand, he held a flyer.

One of those flyers. 

The ones papered across the store like background noise. Always there, always half-glimpsed. Most people never looked twice.

But now, he slid it across the counter toward me.

Slowly. Precisely. Like it meant something. His fingers were long and pale, nails too smooth, too clean.

“Tell a secret,” he said, tapping the paper once with a single finger. His smile widened, sharp and gleaming.
“Gain a lot.”

The boy leaned forward to read it. His brow furrowed. 

His mouth parted like he was about to ask a question—but then he didn’t. Something about the way Mr. Stantsman looked at him stopped it cold.

I stood still, pulse thudding in my throat. My eyes flicked from the flyer… to the boy… and back to the man who already knew what was about to happen.

I felt it in my gut. In my bones. This was it.

A deal.
A dangerous one.

And he didn’t understand. He couldn’t.
Not yet. But I did. And it was already too late.

Carefully, I took each item the boy placed on the counter and began packing them into thick brown paper bags. The cart was overflowing, and it gave me time—slow movements, quiet seconds—to think, to watch, to listen.

Cans. Soap. Sugar. Oatmeal. All going into the bags like this was just another normal day. But my hands weren’t steady. Not really. And I could feel his eyes on me.

Mr. Stantsman stood nearby, watching the exchange with a pleased expression curling at the edges of his mouth. As I sealed the first bag and slid it aside, he gave me a small nod.

Then—a wink. Quick. Intentional. I didn’t return it. I couldn’t.

He stepped back slowly after that, gliding toward the end of the counter. But he didn’t leave. He stopped right beside his office door, resting a hand lightly on the frame. 

And then he turned—not to watch us, but to peer into the darkness of his office.

Like he was checking on something.
Or waiting. 

My fingers hesitated above the last few items. A bottle of syrup. A pack of batteries. I glanced at the boy. Still smiling. Still unaware. Then back at Mr. Stantsman. Still watching the open door. Still smiling.

And the unease that had been building all morning sank just a little deeper into my chest. As soon as the last can was packed and the final bag settled into the cart, I cleared my throat—quiet, careful. Then held up the flyer.

“Looks like you’re getting a deal from the boss,” I said, tone light, almost playful.

I forced a smile.
But my fingers tightened around the edge of the paper, crumpling it slightly.

The boy glanced at it again, still unsure. His brow furrowed, lips parting like he was about to ask something—but I didn’t wait.

I leaned forward just enough for my voice to fall between us, low and urgent, a whisper meant for no one else. 

“Run,” I breathed.
“Before you make the deal.”

He blinked. Eyes locking with mine, confusion blooming fast.

“Wait… what?” he asked. “What deal?”

Behind him, I didn’t have to look to know—Mr. Stantsman was still there. Standing at the edge of his office doorway like a shadow pinned to the frame.

Watching. Listening.
Always listening.

I pulled back slowly, let my posture relax. Gave the boy a nonchalant shrug. Smile still in place.

“To pay,” I said, keeping my voice casual, “we don’t take cash here.” I lifted the flyer with two fingers and tapped it once. “We take exchanges.” Then I gestured toward the overflowing cart.

“Today, your payment will be a secret. One of your own. Something real. Something good.”

The boy’s smile faltered. His eyes flicked between me, the bags, and the paper in my hand like he was trying to see the edges of a trick.

A joke.
Or maybe a test.

I held his gaze.

And I didn’t blink.
Didn’t let the smile slip.
Didn’t let my fear show.
Because I couldn’t.

Not with Mr. Stantsman standing so close.
Not with his eyes still fixed to the black yawning mouth of his office. Not with the boy standing one breath away from a mistake he’d never remember making.

The boy hesitated longer this time. His fingers stopped tapping. His eyes didn’t meet mine.

Then, in a low voice, he said:

“When I was thirteen, my cousin got blamed for something I did.” 

His voice stayed calm, but there was something shaking underneath it.

“We broke a window at my uncle’s place—just being stupid. Throwing rocks. I got scared when it shattered. My uncle came out furious. My cousin didn’t say anything. Just stood there. Took it.” He laughed once—short, bitter.

“I let him. I stood there too. Didn’t say a word. He got grounded for the whole summer. Missed a family trip. Cried when we left without him. And I pretended I missed him. I lied to his face.”

He looked down. “I still haven’t told him. I don’t think I ever will.” And then… it left him. Just like that. 

His shoulders eased. His face smoothed out. The guilt—the rot sitting in his chest—was gone.

And Mr. Stantsman?
He looked like he'd just tasted something perfect.

I watched the boy’s face shift—just a flicker at first. A soft unknitting of his brow. A slow exhale, like something heavy had lifted from his chest.

The guilt was gone.
Not buried. Not ignored.
Gone. 
Like the memory had been scooped clean out of him. His eyes held no trace of it now. No shame. No sting. 
Just calm.

And somewhere—deep in the silent guts of the store—I swore I felt it:

Click.

Like a drawer sliding shut.
A new record. 
A new weight added to the archive of the forgotten.

I couldn’t help but wonder—
Was a file just made for him? Tucked behind that locked office door with the others? Labeled and stored under a name that wouldn’t even remember what it had traded away?

I gave a small nod, keeping my voice steady, practiced. The register lit up red. Not a flash—a pulse. Soft at first, then sharper, brighter, like a heartbeat sealing a pact.

“Payment accepted,” I said.
“Come back again.”

He smiled. Just a normal smile, like I was any other cashier ringing up any other purchase.

Then he turned, hands on the cart, and pushed it toward the door.

The bell jingled. And as he stepped into the golden haze of evening light, he began to whistle. He didn't’t know he’d just forgotten something forever.

Hours passed. The morning blurred into a steady rhythm— bags, quiet footsteps through perfect aisles. I moved on autopilot, pretending to work, pretending not to count the minutes.

But beneath it all, I was waiting. Waiting for the shift. Waiting for the signal.

Then just around lunchtime the bell above the door jingled. I looked up, already half-expecting it. But still—my breath caught.

Mabel.

She stepped inside like someone bracing against a storm. Chin high, shoulders tense. Her eyes scanned the store quickly, like she wasn’t sure if it would still be here, if it was all still real. She wore a soft blue cardigan, a little wrinkled. 

My heart began to race. Not just from nerves—but from the timing.

It was time. 

I straightened slightly behind the counter, watching her make her way in.

Mabel didn’t look at me. She didn’t need to. I could feel it in the air—the shift.

The stage being set.

I kept my head down, pretending to organize the stack of brown paper bags by the register. Fold. Straighten. Fold again. 

I didn’t need to. The bags were already perfect. But it gave my hands something to do—something to hide the way they trembled beneath my skin.

I heard the soft tap of Mabel’s shoes before I saw her. Then—thud. She set a single item down on the counter in front of me.

A huge tin of ground coffee. Familiar. Familiar on purpose. But something was different this time.

A sticker clung to the side—faded yellow, curling slightly at the edges, stamped with the store’s strange seal. That eerie, looping symbol I’d never been able to decipher. 

Mabel didn’t say a word. She just stood there, calm on the outside. But I saw her throat move as she swallowed. And I knew—she was about to give him something. 

And I was about to slip away.

I followed the routine like muscle memory. Kept it smooth. Normal. I slid the tin across the counter. Then gently lowered it into a bag, folding the top with practiced ease.

My heart pounded, but my face stayed neutral.

Just another sale. 
Just another morning.

I cleared my throat quietly, eyes still on the bag.

“Ma’am?” I began, my voice light, innocent—designed to ask something simple. Something distracting. 

“Ah, Miss Mabel.” His voice cut through the air like a cold draft.

Mr. Stantsman.

He emerged from the aisle like he’d been there the whole time—waiting. One hand smoothed the front of his jacket, the other already reaching for the counter like he meant to lean in, own the space between us all.

He smiled, too wide, eyes glittering with something too eager. 

“What a pleasant surprise.”

I froze mid-movement, hand still resting on the edge of the bag. Mabel turned her head slowly, matching his smile with one of her own—warm, polite. But I could see it in her eyes.

She was ready. And now… so was he.

Mr. Stantsman’s gaze drifted down to the tin, eyes locking on the too-bright yellow sticker like it was glowing just for him. He tapped it once with a single pale finger—slow, deliberate.

Almost affectionate. 

Like he wasn’t touching a price tag—but stroking something alive.

“Back for more?” he said, voice smooth as syrup. 

“And such a pricey item.”

His eyes flicked to me—quick, calculating.
A flash of something behind them I didn’t like.
Didn’t understand.

Then came the words: “I’ll handle this one.”

His smile spread—wide, gleaming. Too many teeth. Like his mouth had forgotten how to be human. 

“Take a break, Marie,” he said lightly,
“This may take a while.”

He lifted one hand and gave a gentle flick of his wrist—an elegant, graceful gesture.

Like a man sweeping a pawn off the board. But it wasn’t kindness. It wasn’t even a suggestion.

It was an order.

A dismissal wrapped in silk. 

My throat tightened. My hands felt too still. For a moment, I didn’t move. Then—I gave the smallest nod.

Slid off the stool, smoothed my apron with a hand that didn’t tremble, though everything else inside me did. I turned, walked slow. Deliberate. Every nerve bristling beneath my skin.

Because now…Now it was happening.

Mabel’s bait was on the hook.

And I—I had one shot to slip behind the curtain. To find the truth. 

To see what he didn’t want anyone to see.

Core Day Trips

Visiting Banff from Calgary is a favorite for anyone craving mountain views, glacier-fed lakes, and fresh alpine air—all just a 90-minute drive away. If you're more into dinosaurs, canyons, and desert-like landscapes, Calgary to Drumheller is a trip through time that feels like another planet.

Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man"".

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1752120521.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

1lw39il,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1lw39il/why_i_quit_zyns_and_you_should_too/,Why I quit zyns and you should too,"Hello guys. I recently stumbled across this subreddit and thought I’d  give my two-cents as someone who recently quit the pouches. 

If you’re a college student or college-aged dude that is constantly buzzing off the pouches, using the benefits of “enhanced focus” and energy as an excuse to cultivate a worse nicotine addiction than is possible with any other method of nicotine consumption, listen up. 

I’ll preface this by saying I have an addictive personality and pouches were not the start of my nicotine journey, but they were definitely the end. I started out with Ons in my senior year of HS, 3-6mg, I felt they helped me focus and improved my productivity. I then got into Zyns and noticed that they really hit well after meals, similar to cigarettes which I’d dabbled with after spending a summer in Europe. 

I also noticed that the pouches really hit with a morning coffee, at lecture, after lunch, at the gym, after the gym, while jerking off, after jerking off, while talking to friends, after eating dinner, while drunk, while hungover, while bored, while entertained, during boring conversations with my girlfriend, during fun conversations with my girlfriend - I’m sure you get the point. 

Nicotine was a great mood modulator for me, an energizer, it kept me wired and emotionless, it made me feel constantly stimulated. Yeah, I smoked cigarettes and vaped too, but it got to the point where I’d smoke a cigarette with a 16mg Velo or Pik in my mouth and then hit my vape after I finished. 

I know many people use pouches to quit smoking, but I was so buzzed so often that I just enjoyed the act of smoking - even though the nicotine overload was unpleasant. 

I was on the pouches on and off for around 2 years - and I firmly believe that I’ve quit just before a point of no return. 

Nic pouches buried my emotions under a constant dopamine high. It wasn’t just the nicotine. It was the cycle of addiction and escapism disguised under the veil of a “life enhancer” that stripped me of my sense of self. 

I stopped trying in the gym, I became less empathetic towards others, I chased pleasure and even the “life-enhancing” effects of nicotine were replaced with a preference for short-term gratification. I made rash decisions, got in arguments, made major life decisions like breaking up with my gf (which I later regretted) with my emotions buried under a nicotine buzz. 

I’m sure not everyone develops this relationship with nicotine pouches, but I’d be very careful if you’re at the point of having one in every waking hour. The bottom line is that you’re not living life normally. And some of the thoughts, decisions, and actions you might take while in this nicotine-infected mindset might run counter to your real, authentic, sober intentions. 

If you’re genuinely considering quitting, I hope this helps. I know it can be hard to rationalize as everyone talks about how safe they are compared to the alternatives. I won’t speak on that, but I will say that in my experience, nicotine pouches WILL screw with your emotions and mental state. 

If anyone’s curious, my quitting process began with cutting down my 16 mg’s to 2-3x on Day 1, 1x with 1x 6 mg on Day 2, and 2x 3 mg pn Day 3. This was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then I faced the withdrawals from Thursday-Sunday.


Edit:

Some other downsides for me that I neglected to mention: 
- Sexual performance issues (in many different ways)
- Nobody wants to kiss somebody with a zyn in their mouth 
- Screwed up and inflamed gums 
- $$$
- Feeling like a disgusting fiend all the time",5,1752120238.0,QuittingZyn,1,1.0,False
1lw39gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1lw39gg/the_story_i_thought_id_never_tell/,The Story I Thought I’d Never Tell,"
The story I never wanted to tell, for many reasons, mostly pride. It has been years for me to come to grips with the totality of the situation. I’m now married, not to her, yet it haunted my thoughts. I now have to tell it, to kill it, to fully move on. Here I can anonymously tell the story and let it go.

It started in August of 2022, we met on line. Her, I. The beginning, was honest, stating that “I[she] don’t want a relationship.” But I still chatted for a few weeks until one night I asked if she wanted dinner. We met at a restaurant midway, we talked, telling each other our stories. After dinner we got coffee and the conversation continued. At the conclusion of coffee, I asked her back to my place, she tucked her head and in a shy voice said “I’d really like that.” And so we were off. 

For the next few weeks it was great, we would meet every Friday night for dinner and adult fun after. My emotions began to increase and from her actions her’s did too. One night in October, as we cuddled in my bed, her head tucked in my shoulder, she mouthed “I love you.” I quietly kissed her forehead and said it back. We had never had the conversation of love, but nonetheless it happened organically. The next day I asked if I was her boyfriend and she laughed and said “of course you are” and from that point forward it all went downhill.

The next weekend I saw her as was the norm, yet something was different. She seemed very shaken, not looking me in the eyes. She took a phone call outside. Yet I was too scared to say anything. I thought it would all just get better and go away.

October turned to November and then December. During this time out adult time became less and less. Yet I continued like nothing happened. We got a hotel one weekend and she proclaimed “I don’t want to have sex.” I smiled and said okay, accepting that she had her reasons.

As time progressed she became more distant not seeing me for weeks. This continued for months. Until finally I asked “are we okay.” She smiled, kissed me and said “thank you for being so patient with my crazy life.” That simple reply carried me for 5 more months. Until one night the following November I broke it off. Her only reply was”I told you I didn’t want a relationship.” We kissed one last time and as she drove away, I cried.

As life would have it, I started running into her best friends husband. One night at a bar he told me the truth of what had happened. She had been in FWB with a married man until she met me. And when we started dating she broke it off with him, well for a few months at least. They had decided to be friends and their friendship was platonic for a while, but a few months in she started seeing him during his shifts (he was a cop). She would feel bad, but would say I was patient, kind, and never pushed her. That it was easy to hide because I was clueless. But I wasn’t, I always felt something was off. I was just to scared to say something. 

When we broke up she of course started seeing him more openly and he divorced his wife. I’m not sure if they are still together. What hurts the most is the lies and being played for a fool. I replay our conversations still. I’m in therapy over it to be honest. And it sucks because it’s my secret, my wife, who I love very much, wouldn’t understand why these thoughts still haunt me, hell I don’t even understand them. I just needed to get it off my chest, thanks for listening/reading.

1lw398c,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lw398c/feel_like_giving_up_in_my_cafe/,Feel like giving up in my cafe,"I became a cafe manager just last month and honestly, I'm losing motivation to continue. I don't know if it's just extreme burnout or maybe I just hate where I work, but there's days I wish I was dead than having to go into work the next morning. 

My job itself isn't difficult, I've been managing pretty well, but the things that go into managing my cafe, is taking a toll on me. My cafe is a small department in a huge grocery store chain. I've been wanting the position for a while ever since the first manager moved up in a different department and she was the one who recommended me to our director for this job. Everyone told me I'd do amazing and I believe them. 

But geez, my staff has so many bad habits I need to get them to break away from. I've recently found out they haven't been charging people for practically anything and have been pretty much giving away our coffee, no charges on flavor shots or extra shots or even milk alternatives. They just give people things for free because they feel bad. And I get it, things are expensive but at the same time, I'm losing so much money from these bad habits. They get upset when I'm trying to get them to away from these habits and I just have issues with baristas not caring to do anything. 

And the amount of times I've had people call in for everything, there's been times were I couldn't get a day off because I'd have one of my barista's say her kid has a rash so she needs to be home and then other one say she's has a bad headache. I practically live at work, I've gained a lot of weight, my hair keeps falling more and more, room is a disaster fill with trash pilling up and dirty laundry because my body is just too tired to keep tidying my house. I can't fully enjoy a day off without one of my staff members saying there's an emergency or that we've run out of something or that they don't know what to do for a situation. I feel like I have to hold their hands 24/7. 

I really try to accommodate every barista and try my best to do everything I can for my department and for them, but it's make me lose that drive and I honestly don't feel the love anymore in making coffee. I just hate it now. I can't leave my staff though, so I will continue to keep managing this cafe, but I'm just on the verge of giving up. Maybe I'm just not right for this cafe.

1lw37u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1lw37u1/night_time_struggles/,Night time struggles,"Hey fellow sleep-deprived parents (or sleep-blessed unicorns who can help me),

I need some help (and maybe a hug). My 7-month-old has decided that nighttime is the perfect time for an all-you-can-nurse buffet. Every night, she wakes up 3–4 times for boob... sometimes for 4 minutes, sometimes for 20 — just enough to make sure I’m just falling back asleep before she rings the bell again. 😵‍💫

Some context:

She’s up around 8:30am every day
Eats solids twice a day (breakfast & lunch)
I pump during the day while working, and she gets bottles — but she refuses to take more than 4oz at a time (like, what even is that?? A shot glass?)
I breastfeed on demand when I’m home
We haven’t officially sleep trained yet (but I’m teetering on the edge of trying... anything)
Honestly, it doesn’t seem like she’s starving at night — more like she just wants to check in, say hi, and grab a boob for comfort. I’m running on caffeine and crumbs at this point and really hoping someone has been through this and made it to the other side (with their sanity intact).

How do I gently night-wean or at least stretch the wakeups out? Is this just a phase or do I need to make some changes?

Send help. And coffee. ☕️

1lw36wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1lw36wn/exhausted/,Exhausted,"This is going to be super long...  
  
I am a female in a male dominated industry. I have been doing this for years. I am used to dealing with the backhanded comments, being hit on and all the likes of being a woman. I manage a facility which includes 2 supervisors under me that work for my company and then we hire temps and contractors. I'll admit, I am a straightforward, no bullshit type of person. I address what needs to be address but I'm not stone cold. I am empathetic to the strife of life.

I hired a previous employee \[well call him employee X\] and long time friend into one of the supervisor roles back in September of last year which is like a 1st shift position. I'll start by saying I had 2 other people interview him to try to avoid bias and everything below is new. He was NEVER like this in the past. I previously did his job so I personally trained him. I take detailed notes on every task. I gave him all my notes. I set up templates for him and gave him everything he could possibly need. He has really intense health issues that I didn't realize had gotten so bad. October-November his work was very poor. He was constantly forgetting things, failing to complete work regularly and struggling a lot to get through the work day. I took on some of his work because I knew it was health related. He assured me that being off medications due to insurance switch was the issue and once they got it straightened out he would be fine. He did get better! At the beginning of the year, he seemed back to his old self. 

From the time I hired employee X, there were tasks that he was assigned that he just never did for one reason or another. Please forgive me if this gets confusing because giving too much information would give too much away. I gave him a template for one of the tasks and he decided to make his own. It didn't meet the requirements of the task so I asked him to correct it. He sent me a spreadsheet for it weeks and several follow ups later. Again, it didn't meet the requirements so he set out to fix it. When I follow up on it a week later he said he sat down to do some coding on it and accidentally deleted everything and gave up. This is a daily task that for months he failed to complete for one reason or another. And I started to realize there were many daily assigned tasks like this. When I sat down to do his review in February, I covered everything with him. His successes, failures, goals, etc. It was detailed and outlined with a plan. He thoroughly agreed with my assessment.

Throughout this, I have offered help. I have asked if he has had too much on his plate or if we need to go over things and he always tells me he's got it. Now my other supervisor, we'll call him employee Y, was 12 crayons short of a full box. His shift is technically a 3rd shift position. He was in the role before I was promoted. Even the previous manager apologized for having to adopt him. I have never seen someone in a lead role who had zero ability to direct or even talk to people. He received multiple complaints about racist comments that I had to address. He just was ignorant but I couldn't let it slide. Most of the job is physical but it does require some computer work and that took so much training. I worked with him one on one, signed him up for manager trainings on how to manage, how to deal with confrontation, how to compose professional emails, I reached out a got a contact of someone in the same role at another location to support him, etc. If he ever felt like he did something wrong through, whether he did or didn't, it became everyone else's problem. He would fall apart and then everything that day or week would go wrong. I would literally have to coddle him to get his self respect back up and then he would be cheery. No matter how much he did wrong or what went wrong, I had to be very careful with how I approached it because he would just crumble. 

Employee X wanted to help with employee Y so bad. He would pull him aside before I got to work and have 1 on 1s with him. This led to Employee Y looking to Employee X for leadership and advice. Employee X is new to this industry and even now has a lot to learn. I know he was trying to help but then it led to Employee Y regurgitating whatever X suggested. X said to Y, Do you feel supported? Y said to me, I don't feel supported... which as state above, I went above and beyond to help him... and he even praised me on several occasions for helping to develop him.

Well it all came to a head in March when Y snapped at work. I pulled him into a private conversation and he told me that he couldn't handle the job, it was too demanding and he wanted to just work and not have to think. He didn't want to be a supervisor anymore. I told him that I would help him if that's what he wanted. He could step down and we would find a replacement. He said he would help train his replacement. In a later conversation, he told me he interviewed for another location and if he got it, he would still stay on and train the new person. I was supportive of him. On a Friday, he let me know he got the job. We had already posted his job online so no big deal. On Monday, he never showed up again. I immediately took on his job responsibilities along with my own. For a month, I worked 14 hour days to cover 3rd shift, interview for the position and get my  work done. I tried not to dump any of the extra work on X so that he could focus on his job. He did help me a little. I didn't ask him to but I was grateful. I would buy him coffee and food a lot as a token of my appreciation.

I hired employee Z in April. On his first day, I showed up to employee X already doing 3rd shift work and what appeared to be, him training Z. His shift starts hours later. I'll admit exhaustion and frustration over took me and I snapped. I yelled, What are you doing?!? I immediately realized my tone and tried to wheel it in. He tried to explain that he came in at midnight to get stuff done. The whole situation didn't sit well with me. Later, in a private conversation he told me that I undermined his authority in front of Z and set the stage for how Z could treat him... which the whole thing did the opposite. He set the stage for Z not listening to me. He demanded an apology from me. I apologized for losing my cool but tried to explain that he overstepped. He wasn't having it. This exacerbated tensions. All the while, he still wasn't doing his daily assigned tasks. 

Our company is set up so that if one of my supervisors can't work, their position is vital and must be executed by me. The week after Z started, he was sick and missed work. I covered him. This has become an ongoing theme. He has worked there 3 months and has already been sick twice and taken 5 unapproved vacation days. I have covered all of it. In May, I graduated on Saturday. I wanted to take Friday and Monday off. I flew back on Sunday to get a message that Z wouldn't be at work Monday.  

X's work was getting worse and worse again. Not completing daily spreadsheets, not doing daily audits at all, not doing the things I asked of him. I gave him his first write up after tons of verbal coaching and emails. He, again, agreed with everything I put in the write up. We set expectations going forward. It did not get better. He would show up to work unable to keep his eyes open claiming he was exhausted and couldn't' think. On a Wednesday or Thursday, he yelled at a contractor and stormed off. I pulled him aside. He told me he was overwhelmed and exhausted. I told him to go home and get some rest. 

The next day he was no different. We talked. I asked what has him so overwhelmed. I found out that each of his simple tasks was being turned into hours long projects because whenever I would point out something wrong, He would dive into it. A full daily audit takes me 30 minutes to complete. He was spending 4 hours on it, not finishing and giving up all because one time I pointed out that he missed something. And there were several things like this. I questioned where this comes from because I've never asked him to do anything different than what he was trained on. He said he feels like, when he misses something, he has to double and triple check it so he doesn't miss anything. 

 He asked me for the next week off. I was taken aback. I told him that I could give him maybe a couple of days but I can't cover a full week on short notice and with my tank empty too. I also volunteer Search and Rescue. I had committed to 5 days Wed through Sun for an event.  I went nonstop and forgot to get back to him. I texted him Sunday morning and apologized for getting back to him late. I told him to take Monday off. He told me no. He had killed himself all weekend trying to get stuff done so that he could work Monday. I told him not to come in so he could get some rest. I covered him Monday. On Tuesday, he showed up no different than before. Oh. And late. Late every day. He was of no use to me if he could barely talk or keep his eyes open. I've never been in this position. I sat down with him to try to talk to him and every answer was ""I don't care."" At one point he even said, fire me. I don't care about anything anymore. He just claims he's exhausted from moving and work. No other issues. Also, I offered to help him move like 3 times. I sent him home and gave him the rest of the week off to recover and reflect. 

All of our jobs ARE EASY. All of the computer work that we do can be done in a couple hours. We have to be on site for various things which take up time but my Gods. The next week X is back and we sit down. He seems a lot better physically. But surprise, employee Z needs the rest of the week off. He has taken to notifying me of when he isn't coming in through a group chat with X. I tried to talk to him at work about how I would have preferred he come to me directly and talked to me about needing time off and he snapped. He was like, I have things to do. This is my priority. This job is not my priority so I don't care. I won't be here and walked out of my office. 

There is so much more of these events and conversations I haven't even included. I have managed many businesses but I have never had such an unreliable or even untrustworthy team. Things happen. Things get missed or forgotten but not on an every day, every time scale. I hired these guys myself because I thought they were capable and would support me and the business as needed. I have poured myself into their training and needs and gotten nothing in return. I pride myself on being the manager I would want for myself. I don't like to micromanage. I want to be able to train someone, give them direction as needed but let them float and correct as we go. These guys want to be able to do whatever they want and get mad when I try to correct. I believe in coaching and correcting. I hate punishing people because like I said, the job is easy. We should be able to fix it and move on.

I talked to my manager about all of this. He came down the week Z was last out of town. He talked with me and X. Now.. I'm a bleeding heart sometimes but I have met my capacity on empathy with these guys. I feel used and abused. The whole conversation was X saying I feel you talk to me this way. I feel like you don't trust me. I feel this. I feel that. Well okay. I don't trust him to do his job at this point. I really don't. He has given me ZERO reason to. My boss indulged him making me feel like I didn't matter but I sucked it up. 

Then I had a talk with HR about employee Z and she told me that we can write him up for his unapproved absences but I cannot be the reason they can't take off work. What do you mean? I literally have to cover their time off and I haven't had a chance to recover myself in going on 6 months but I cannot deny their time off if I am not physically capable of covering it?! No. You must be out of your damn mind. I didn't say that. Both of my employees have taken off over 40 hours of work in the last 4 months but I can't even get a weekend off. That is insane.

Following that conversation, I typed an email to my boss saying, we have to take Fatigue Management every year but not practice it. I have gotten no support and I am at a loss. There was a lot in that email. He and I talked at the beginning of this week and he was empathetic to my needs but will anything change?

I have reached out to so many people for support. Some tell me to just fire these guys. Some tell me I'm the problem. I try really hard to be a good person and a good manager. Honestly, they make me feel taken advantage of and then everyone above me says there is nothing I can do about it. They tell me they are overwhelmed or exhausted but I am the only person doing all their work. X took off Tuesday and Z left early without finishing his work. I did all of it. I only wasn't able to complete a couple of my reports which I did today but I did 3 jobs in about 14 hours. Why can't they do their damn jobs and show up?!?!?

1lw357h,https://i.redd.it/rxltj9cwzybf1.png,The bisyo that I'll never regret,"*(long post ahead about my running journey — skip if you don’t like sappy stuff lmao)*

I started taking running seriously just this January. Last year, I ran a bit with my then-partner, but it wasn’t consistent — and honestly, I didn’t really understand anything beyond “put on shoes and go.” It was fun, but not serious.

Then the year changed. So did my relationship status. The breakup happened at the start of the year (literally lmao), and with all the noise in my head, I decided to just… run. I needed to move. I needed to breathe.

I knew *nothing*. Like, absolutely nothing. I didn’t know what pace was, didn’t understand HR zones or splits, or why people kept saying things like “easy run” or “recovery day” (I thought all running hurt equally lol). I even thought a 3K fun run was a marathon. TBH, the ignorance was loud HASHAHAHAAHGA 😭🤣

But I ran anyway. Alone at first. Even joined a trail run alone, too. Then somewhere mid-year, I met people who slowly became my running family. Not a club — just casual people who are also into running and happened to be kind enough to invite me along. One invite turned into weekly runs, and suddenly I wasn’t alone anymore.

From running a 3K last February to now training for a half marathon this coming September, it’s wild to think how far I’ve come. Not just in distance, but in mindset.

And to you lovely redditors who answered my questions about running shoes, watches, coffee (yes, I asked if it was okay to drink coffee pre-run lol), and even running playlists — THANK YOU!!! You made me feel less clueless and more seen.

I still don’t *love* running — but I *love* what it’s brought into my life: peace, clarity, new friends, and a version of myself I’m proud of.

TL;DR: Started running in January, knew nothing, just ran. Found good people, found peace. Now training for my first half marathon. Thanks Reddit for the help and support!

Max was 21, a quiet college senior with a mind full of questions and a heart he kept mostly to himself. He spent most of his time buried in books or sketching strange little worlds in the corners of his notebooks. He didn’t party much. He didn’t date much. His world was calm, almost too calm—until he met Lauren.

She was 20, bold in a way that wasn’t loud. She wore chipped nail polish and always had music playing in her earbuds, even when they weren’t in. She transferred to his university that fall and started working part-time at the campus coffee shop—the same one Max studied at nearly every afternoon.

The first time he noticed her, she was behind the counter, humming a tune she didn’t seem to care if anyone else could hear. She smiled without needing a reason. When their eyes met, she didn’t look away like most people. She raised an eyebrow and asked, “What’s your name, notebook boy?”

“Max,” he said, blinking. “And… yours?”

“Lauren,” she replied, handing him his drink. “You look like the kind of guy who doesn’t let his coffee get cold.”

He didn’t know what that meant at the time. But he wanted to.

Weeks passed. She kept his name in her memory and his usual order in her hands before he even got to the counter. They started talking more. At first, it was casual. Music. Books. The weird way the sky looked pink at 4:53 PM in October. But something bloomed slowly between them—something that made time shift.

She noticed the way he got quiet when he talked about his future, like it scared him. He noticed how she bit her lip when she was thinking hard, like the world was something she could taste if she just focused enough.

One rainy evening, when the coffee shop was nearly empty, Lauren sat down across from him instead of going back behind the counter.

“You ever feel like you’re waiting for your life to start?” she asked.

He nodded. “Every day.”

She smiled. “Maybe it already has, and we just haven’t realized it.”

Max wasn’t sure when it happened. But somewhere between unfinished lattes and half-shared playlists, he fell in love with her. Not the kind of love you shout about—but the kind that fills in the empty parts of you quietly, like sunlight through blinds.

One night, he walked her home. Just before she went inside, she turned to him and said, “You’re not like other people, Max.”

“Why?”

“Because you see things. And you listen. And when I’m around you… I feel like I’m finally heard.”

He didn’t kiss her that night. He just held her hand for a few seconds longer than he should’ve. But she didn’t let go either.

Love, he realized, wasn’t always a firework. Sometimes it was just a warm cup of coffee that never had the chance to get cold.

It had been a month since the night Max walked Lauren home. Since then, their friendship—if it could still be called that—had shifted into something deeper. Not yet official. Not quite defined. But real.

They saw each other nearly every day. Sometimes in the early mornings before class, sitting on the library steps sharing bagels. Sometimes late at night, walking under the streetlights, talking about childhood, regrets, and how weird it is to grow up and not know if you’re doing it right.

Max had never said the words out loud—I love you—but they sat on the tip of his tongue constantly, like the edge of a dream he was scared to wake up from.

One evening, the two of them drove out of the city, just to get away. Lauren liked open skies. She said it reminded her that nothing lasts forever, but somehow, that made everything feel more beautiful. They parked on a hill overlooking a valley, the sky above them streaked in violet and gold.

“I feel like we’re right in the middle of something,” Lauren said, resting her head on his shoulder.

“We are,” Max replied.

“But what is it?”

He hesitated. Then, almost without thinking, he said, “It’s love. Or… I think it is.”

She didn’t say anything for a moment. Just breathed. Slowly. Quietly. Then turned to him with a soft smile.

“Yeah,” she whispered. “I think it is too.”

That night, as the stars came out one by one, they kissed for the first time. Not rushed. Not desperate. Just… honest.


In the weeks that followed, their love unfolded in all its imperfect glory. There were late-night phone calls when they couldn’t sleep. Shared headphones on the train. Little notes tucked into each other’s backpacks. But there were also arguments—about the future, about fear, about whether they were moving too fast or not fast enough.

One night, Max found her sitting outside her apartment, knees pulled to her chest. He could tell she’d been crying.

“I’m scared,” she said quietly. “Of losing this. Of not being enough for you.”

He sat beside her and didn’t speak for a while. Then, gently, he said, “You’re already everything I didn’t know I needed. You don’t have to try. Just… be with me. That’s enough.”

And somehow, it was.

By winter, they were officially together. People noticed the way Max started smiling more. The way Lauren’s laugh softened around him. They weren’t perfect, but they chose each other every single day.

One night, back at the same hilltop where it all started, Lauren looked at him and said, “You still drink your coffee before it gets cold.”

He smiled. “Only because I don’t want to waste a single second.”

She reached for his hand.

“Neither do I.”

Three Years Later

The coffee shop where they first met had closed down a year ago—replaced by a faceless smoothie chain. Max and Lauren didn’t mind. They still called it their spot. Sometimes, when the sun hit just right, they’d sit across the street, sip coffee from paper cups, and pretend the old place was still there.

They lived together now. A small apartment on the third floor, where the windows fogged up in the winter and the pipes made sounds like ghosts arguing. It wasn’t perfect. But it was theirs.

Max was 24 now, working part-time at a design studio and tutoring to make ends meet. Lauren had just turned 23, wrapping up her degree, her sketchbook always tucked under her arm, filled with half-finished poems and dreamy little drawings of cities she swore they’d visit one day.

Life wasn’t glamorous—but it was honest.

One morning, Lauren woke up before her. The sky outside was soft and pale, the kind of light that felt like a whisper. He walked into the kitchen and started brewing coffee, careful not to make noise. He pulled out two mugs—hers had little cats on it, his was chipped on one side—and waited while the pot filled the room with that warm, familiar scent.

She wandered in a few minutes later, wrapped in a blanket, hair messy, eyes sleepy.

“You’re up early,” she said.

He smiled and handed her the mug.

“I like mornings,” he said. “Especially when you’re in them.”

Lauren laughed gently, leaning against the counter. “Still a soft boy, huh?”

“Only for you.”

Later that afternoon, they went back to the hill—the same one they drove to all those years ago. It had become a tradition: once a year, same day, same spot. They laid out a blanket, shared a sandwich, and watched the sky turn violet, just like it used to.

Lauren looked over at him, serious now.

“Max,” she said. “Do you ever think about how weird it is that we found each other? Like out of everyone in the world?”

“All the time.”

“I think I knew it was you the first time you ordered a black coffee and couldn’t look me in the eye.”

He laughed. “I was terrified.”

“I wasn’t.”

“I know,” he said. “You made me brave.”

There was a long pause.

Then, Max reached into his coat pocket.

Her breath caught the moment she saw the small box in his hand.

“You still never let your coffee get cold,” he said, opening it slowly. “But I’d wait forever for you.”

Tears welled in her eyes.

She didn’t say yes.

She just tackled him into a hug, laughing and crying and nodding all at once.

And up on that hill, as the sky burned violet and the wind whispered around them, Max held Lauren close, heart full of everything that mattered.

They didn’t need the old coffee shop anymore.

They had everything they needed—right there, before the coffee got cold.",1,1752119843.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost"", young man.

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",2,1752119725.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

I get home, open the garage, place the ramps down. I start driving up the ramps nice and slow, but my car does NOT want to do the thing! I rev the engine a bit more and BAM! I drove over the top of the ramps and they are now stuck under my damn car!!!

I figure I'll just use my jack to lift the car up, no problem. I was wrong. BIG problem. The hydraulic fluid has leaked out of the jack and now the jack will not do the thing. My first thought is to call my dad. He was unable to come get me out of my hot mess because he was hauling stuff for his and his wife's coffee shop. 

I figure my neighbor has a jack, which luckily, he does. He helped my jack my car up and get the ramps out. Then he tried to help me get my car up on the ramps but I was afraid to go over them again. He ended up pulling my car up on the ramps for me. 

I drained the oil. Then I go to remove the filter and I accidentally tighten it. The ratchet is now stuck on the oil filter, with the handle shoved up in the engine bay stuck in some tubing. It took me like 30-minutes to remove the damn thing. While I am doing this, my neighbor leaves his house. I finally get the stupid ratchet off, reposition, and then make sure the rachet is going the right way. The wrench that goes on the end of the ratchet is now stripped and I can't get the old filter off. 

I have a mini-meltdown and like 20 minutes later my neighbor comes back and lends me an oil wrench that has some teeth in on it. I finally get the oil filter off.

Was this my first time changing my oil? NOPE. Am I am giant idiot? Yep, probably!

You’ve just stepped into r/GreenThumbGuildsInfo, the mud-under-your-nails, sun-bleached-hat corner of the internet where “I grow it like me” is the only rule that matters.​This isn’t a showcase for Instagram-perfect gardens. It’s for the plots born from “What if I plant marigolds next to my peppers?” and “I found this cracked pot at a yard sale—let’s see if mint will thrive in it.” Post that lopsided herb garden where the rosemary is taller than the thyme (“It’s chaotic, but it smells like summer when I brush past it”). Share the tomato plant that produced three tiny, misshapen fruits (“They’re weirdly shaped, but they taste like sunshine—worth every overwatering panic”). Ask for help with that succulent that’s turned into a “leggy mess” (“Did I not give it enough light? Send tips—and maybe a pep talk for my guilty conscience”). Laugh over the “oops” moments: the first time you tried to prune a rose bush and ended up with more thorns than blooms (“Now it’s a ‘wild and free’ aesthetic”), the sunburn from forgetting sunscreen while planting (“Proof I committed to the dirt”), the lettuce that bolted before you could harvest it (“It’s got personality—let’s call it ‘early bloomer energy’”).​Here, imperfection is your green thumb’s superpower. Swap hacks: “Use eggshells to keep slugs away—no more sad, chewed leaves!” “Coffee grounds make great fertilizer for acid-loving plants like blueberries.” Celebrate the small wins: nailing that tricky graft after two failed tries, a neighbor stopping to say, “You grew that?!” when they see your overflowing tomato cage, finally getting your cilantro to last longer than two weeks. Gardening isn’t about having a magazine-worthy plot—it’s about being *unapologetic*. It’s about looking at a patch of soil or a packet of seeds and thinking, “I can turn this into something that grows like me.”​So grab your trowel (and maybe a band-aid for thorns), dig out those half-used seed packets, and bring the plants that make you smile when you check on them in the morning.

It’s the process that feels like an extension of your own hands in the earth.

Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man""

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1752119253.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

Happened out of nowhere one day. 1 min im drinking my coffee, the next the world is spinning. Lately its been bad but shorter duration.

Yesterday me and my daughter (she's a cna too)we were getting ready to roll a patient at about 9:45pm. I lifted my head a tiny bit and  it came on SO VIOLENTLY.

I landed w my hands on the bed and 5 seconds later realized shit its vertigo. Scared the crap out the poor patient (tg he knows me and sympathized as he's had it before) it went from wild to tame in less then 5 mins w lingering dizziness for maybe 15 mins and immediately after felt the ear fullness. If id had been walking i would have landed on the hard cement floor. Ive never had one slam into me so hard and violently bad before. Normally i get my warning signs of feeling off ln the head, actually feel it coming on before the spins or ear fullness. My only warning was feeling faint when bending down a few times or getting up (like low blood pressure faint). My bp shot up to 154/90 after the attack.

Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man""

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1752119106.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it""I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man"".

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

I was DOGE’d (former USAID contractor) back in February and just recently started a new job. This week was my first paycheck in six months. Because of this, my situation right now is really not great and I’m in the process of starting over so wanted to shed some light on what that looks like.

**Section One: Assets and Debt** 

* **Retirement Balance**: 2.5k in my 401k, I had to pull some money out to cover rent while unemployed but I'm proud I still have something 
* **Savings account balance:** Currently 0. Prior to unemployment, it was about 5k. I lived off of my savings
* **Checking account balance**: $200 at the moment  I just paid my rent and student loans and am waiting for the next paycheck right now
* **Credit card debt:** 1.5k accumulated due to travel and some medical costs as well
* **Student loan debt**: This is the big one. 105k for my bachelors. 

Without going into too much detail, my dad  financially abused my mom (and by extension, my whole family). They got divorced while I was in college and was a lot emotionally and financially It was also covid and both of my parents experienced layoffs. Student loans were the only way I could go to school. We did what had to be done.  

It is my biggest money anxiety and insecurity because I feel like people get really judgmental about student debt but honestly, I don’t regret it. I value education so much and I am so proud of what my mom was able to overcome during that time. My mom has also regularly helped me with it when she has extra money and has been so supportive with it.

Student debt is a systemic problem that specifically prays on the lower-middle class and women in situations like my mom was.  My situation is awful and stressful but has also shaped me into an activist and I protest and donate regularly to student loan forgiveness causes. 

I am planning on getting a masters within the next couple of years but will be moving abroad to a country that doesn’t force mass amounts of debt for education.  

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** I have been out of college for two years now. I worked part time all through college at about 25k a year.

After college, I started my career at USAID. It was my dream job and exactly what my degree is in.  I made 53k starting out and then after 6 months, I was promoted and started making 87k. This was more money than really anyone in my life was making and I was so proud but also had so much guilt for finally being financially stable.

And then, boom. DOGE happened. It was devastating and honestly one of the hardest things I have ever gone through. There is no way to word how awful it was. 140,000 jobs lost and an estimated 15 million people will die due to lack of aid. 

 After six months of unemployment, I was offered my current job. It is technically still in my field as I previously was working in communications for USAID. My job now is public relations but is not in the international development sector and is much more corporate. I took a pay cut too.  I have mixed thoughts but it’s okay for now. Eventually, I would like to move back to international relations

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

$3,900 a month after tax (which my taxes are $1,100 a month). My new job does not open 401k contributions until we reach 90 days employed so currently no deduction there but will end up being around 200 a month. I am on my family’s health insurance.

I also live with my boyfriend but we do not fully combine finances. He is currently in grad school and makes 37k working part time so we split things 65/35ish. 

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Money Diary:**

**Monday:**

I woke up early and did an online pilates class before logging on to work. Today was a meeting heavy day so I barely had time to eat but managed a few minutes to make myself some toast and a smoothie for breakfast and turkey, cheese, and crackers for lunch. My partner had gone grocery shopping the day before as we alternate grocery weeks. He was on campus for his summer grad classes but got home around 4 and I finished up work. We cooked dinner together. After dinner, he had homework so I watched TV and then ended the night with reading the latest book, The Coin by Yasmin Zaher, that I checked out from the library.

**Day total: $0**

**Tuesday:**

Another work from home day and my partner had a 12 hour restaurant shift so I was on my own in the apartment all day. I did some yoga, made myself some coffee, toast, scrambled eggs, and strawberries for breakfast and got to work on some media relations tasks. I ended up working through lunch but had a late afternoon snack. I then had a few client calls and tackled another writing project. After work, I FaceTimed my best friend and had a virtual dinner date over a couple glasses on wine and my homemade copycat sweet green salad that I had meal prepped on Sunday. We ended up talking until 11:30 so after we got off the phone, it was time for bed!

**Day total: $0**

**Wednesday**:

My only in office day! I left my apartment around 8:30 and hopped on the metro for a 20 minute commute **($2.50)**.  Once I got to work, I got a coffee with my coworkers. My office provides breakfast and lunch for staff on in-office days which is so nice.  I then a worked on some social media posts for a client which took me most of the morning. I had a quick meeting and then it was time for catered lunch.  It was greek food, delicious, and it was great to spend time with my coworkers since I’m new and we’re mostly virtual. Did some media relations work for the rest of the afternoon and then got back on the train **($2.50**).  The train was delayed so it took an hour to get home. I had leftovers from lunch and hung out with my boyfriend. We sat down and started discussing engagement ring/wedding budget as we are planning on getting engaged soon once we’re a little more stable. Super exciting! After that, he had an assignment due so I cranked out some homework. I called a friend and ended up finishing The Coin. I rated it 3.75 stars. It is a weird book about a weird girl but I would recommend. 

**Day total: $5**

**Thursday:**

I got up early and went on a long walk. I then came back and logged on to see that the senate passed the big ugly bill which was going to affect a lot of our clients. As I am the main person in my office with government background, I was tasked with reading through it and taking notes. This took several hours because legislative language is so convaluted at times. As a treat for sacrificing my sanity, I ordered myself takeout from my favorite local sandwich place **($18.34)**. I spent a good hour or so doomscrolling before I had a late afternoon meeting which ended up going over until the end of the workday. I was feeling really burnt out and low mentally so I talked to my sister on the phone for a while and had a self care night where I heated up trader joes orange chicken, listen to Taylor swift, did some water color painting, and then took a long bath.

**Day total: $18.34**

**Friday:**

It was the Fourth of July. We ended up staying in most of the day. After going through what I did with USAID, it felt really weird and hard to even pretend to celebrate. DC is also so crazy with tourists and I didn't have the energy to deal with that. My partner and I hadn’t spent much time together over the week between his grad school stuff and work so we took the day as a date day. We went out to brunch at our favorite coffee shop (he paid) and talked, played board games, and cuddled. We did decide to pack a picnic and take it to the park across the street from our apartment. I ran to the store to grab picnic provisions (**39.24).** We came home after dinner and watched fireworks from the window and watched the west wing because there's nothing like a dose of idealism on the Fourth of July.

**Day total: $39.34**

**Saturday:**

My partner had an all day shift and I took the metro **($2.50**) out to the Maryland suburbs and met up with my mom, sister, grandma, and aunt. I grew up in Maryland and feel very lucky to see my family often. We went out to lunch which my aunt covered for me. Then my mom, grandma, and I went to Ulta and I picked up my first non-food frivioulious purchase since getting my new job! Anti-frizz hair oil (from the frizz line of Living Proof, highly recommend). I have thick, wavy hair that does not handle the humidity and it felt so good to invest in a product to help it. I also got some pimple patches because miss flo had arrived and was ravaging my skin. Total was **$42.39**. After Ulta, we hung out at my grandma’s house for a while and caught up. My grandma gave me an extra dehumidifier she had which is a god send since it’s so humid in DC right now.  My mom drove me back to the city. We stopped and got ice cream nd then she helped me set up my dehumidifier before heading out. My boyfriend got home soon after and we spent time together and went to bed. 

**Day total: $44.89**

**Sunday:**

Sunday was such a busy and fun day. My partner was working again so I had the day to myself. I woke up early and went to the farmers market where I picked up some fresh produce, coffee, and a croissant **(19.35).** I walked around a local bookstore and  then went by CVS to pick up toiletries and my anxiety meds **(20.73)**. It was my turn to cover groceries for the week so I went on a trader joes run and spent **110.32** on groceries. As all trader joes lovers know, they  never has everything so I stopped by safeway for household supplies **(37.16)**. After hauling some very heavy grocery bags back to my apartment, I took a break and scrolled on my phone for a bit before hopping into my weekly Sunday reset chores. The laundry in my building is in the basement and I spent $**10** for two loads, cleaned my bathroom, and living room. My partner got home and he cleaned the bathroom and kitchen while I did some meal prep for the week). After doing chores, I did some yoga and read for a while before my boyfriend joined me for a movie night.

Every Single One Of Them Is Coming To Pass.,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2003""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2003""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it""I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost"", young man.

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1752118740.0,JordanGrupeHorror,0,1.0,False

I made sure to wave my wedding band around a few times, to subtly let her know that I was not interested if there was an agenda, but no. There wasn’t an agenda. It was just a refreshing conversation with a warm stranger.

My wife never wants to talk to me, which is worse than the sexlessness. We exchange maybe 5 minutes worth of conversation per day, even though we are around each other for hours.

She’s always been like this, and I’m afraid I’ve just become accustomed to it. I love her, but the silence can be so cruel, so cutting.

Our dead bedroom was a long time coming. I ignored all the red flags, and I’m afraid I’m in a position now where I have to live with the silence and lack of intimacy until my final days.

Not because the food was bad…  
Not because I wasn’t trying hard enough…  
But because I was doing it for the wrong reasons.

I saw food as **punishment.**  
I saw weight loss as **a battle to hate my body into submission.**  
I kept thinking: “I have to suffer to change.”

**But when I started keto — something clicked.**  
Not in my body.  
In my **mind**.

# 🧠 I Stopped Thinking “Diet”… and Started Thinking “Healing”

This time, I wasn’t chasing thinness.  
I was chasing peace.

Peace with food.  
Peace with my body.  
Peace with my energy, my sleep, my skin, my mood swings.

I told myself:

>

# 💥 That One Thought Changed EVERYTHING

Instead of restriction, I started focusing on **nourishment**.

* **Fats** that fuel my brain
* **Protein** that builds and protects me
* **Low-carb veggies** that cleanse and support me
* **Hydration and salt** that energized me

No more “how little can I eat?”  
Now it was, “how can I feel better today?”

# 🥑 My First “Healing” Keto Day Looked Like This:

**Morning:**

* Black coffee with 1 tsp MCT oil
* 2 boiled eggs with pink salt
* Sautéed spinach in ghee

**Lunch:**

* Grilled chicken thigh
* Avocado + roasted zucchini
* Olive oil + lemon + chili flakes

**Dinner:**

* Paneer tikka with low-carb salad
* Cauliflower mash with garlic butter

**Snacks:**

* Almonds, cheese cubes, or cucumber with salt and lemon

And most importantly:  
**No guilt. No calorie counting. No self-hate.**

# ✨ Real Transformation Starts From the Inside

You can follow every keto rule and still quit —  
**If your mindset is rooted in punishment.**

But if you lead with love, with intention, with healing —  
Every small win feels like a homecoming.

1lw2ove,https://i.redd.it/i0g5x18jvybf1.jpeg,How to List Your Business on Google in Canada,"In today’s digital-first world, having your business show up on Google is no longer optional—it’s essential. Whether you're a small café in Toronto or a startup in Vancouver, listing your business on Google in Canada can dramatically increase your visibility, attract more local customers, and build trust with your audience.
This guide will walk you through how to list your business on Google in Canada, with clear steps, insider tips, and real-world examples tailored to Canadian businesses. Let’s get started

Why Listing Your Business on Google Canada Matters?
Before diving into the steps, let’s explore why this process is so crucial. 

Google is the most widely used search engine globally, and Canada is no exception. When customers search for services or products, they often turn to Google Maps or Google Search to find local options. A Google Business Profile (formerly known as Google My Business) ensures that your business information—such as address, contact details, hours of operation, and reviews—appears front and center in search results.

Step-by-Step Guide to Listing Your Business on Google Canada:

- Create or Sign in to a Google Account
If you don’t have a Google account, create one at accounts.google.com.
Use a business email address if possible for professionalism.


- Go to Google Business Profile Manager
Visit the Google Business Profile Manager.
Click the “Manage now” button to start the process.

- Enter Your Business Information
Business Name: Use your official business name as it appears on your signage or website.
Business Category: Choose the most relevant category. For example, if you run a coffee shop, select “Coffee Shop” rather than a generic category like “Restaurant.”
Location: If you have a physical storefront, enter your exact address. For service-based businesses, you can hide your address and specify the areas you serve.

Pro Tip: 
Consistency is key! Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) match how they appear on your website and other directories.

Add Contact Details and Website:
Provide a phone number customers can use to reach you.
Include your website URL for more information and to drive traffic.

Verify Your Business:
Verification is a critical step to appear on Google Canada. Google will send you a verification code via one of the following methods
Postcard by Mail: This is the most common option. A postcard will arrive at your business address within 5–10 days.
Phone or Email: Some businesses are eligible for instant verification via phone or email.
Video Verification: In certain cases, Google may request a video call to confirm your business location and setup.
Once you receive the verification code, follow the instructions to complete the process.

Optimize Your Google Business Profile:
After verification, you can enhance your profile by
Adding Photos: Upload high-quality pictures of your storefront, interior, products, or services to attract customers.
Writing a Business Description: Clearly explain what your business offers, incorporating relevant keywords like “local bakery in Toronto” or “plumber in Vancouver.”
Updating Hours of Operation: Keep your hours accurate, including special holiday hours.
Enabling Reviews: Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews to build trust and social proof.

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
Using a PO Box instead of a physical address (Google doesn’t accept PO Boxes).
Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) across your website and directories.
Keyword stuffing in your business name (e.g., “John’s Plumbing Toronto Emergency Services” instead of “John’s Plumbing”).

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
1. How do I list my business on Google in Canada for free?
You can list your business for free by creating a Google Business Profile at google.com/business, entering your details, and completing the verification process.

2. How long does it take to get verified on Google Business in Canada?
Verification by postcard typically takes 5–14 business days. Other methods like phone or email (when available) are much faster, often instant.

3. Can I list my business on Google without a physical address in Canada?
Yes, if you’re a service-area business (e.g., mobile mechanic or home cleaner), you can hide your address and define your service area instead.

4. Why isn’t my business showing up on Google Maps in Canada?
Common reasons include incomplete profile info, pending verification, low activity, or incorrect categories. Make sure your listing is optimized and up to date.

5. How do I change my business hours on Google in Canada?
Log in to your Google Business Profile, go to the “Info” section, and edit your hours—including holiday-specific updates like Canada Day or Victoria Day.

6. Is it worth getting Google reviews in Canada?
Absolutely. Positive Google reviews improve trust and local SEO rankings. In Canada, businesses with more reviews often appear higher in local search results.

7. Can I manage multiple locations in Canada with one Google account?
Yes. You can add and manage multiple business locations under one account using the “Add location” option in your Google Business dashboard.

Conclusion:
Listing your business on Google in Canada is a simple yet powerful move to boost your online visibility, attract local customers, and build trust. By following the steps in this guide and optimizing your profile continuously, you’ll stay ahead in the competitive Canadian market.

1lw2oav,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lw2oav/sub_1000_yellow_espresso_machine_gcp_e24_or/,[Sub $1000] Yellow espresso machine: GCP E24 or Profitec Go?,"My favorite color is yellow. 

Looking to pickup my first espresso machine and I’m dead set on choosing one that comes in yellow. I don’t plan to upgrade machines down the line, I’m hoping to buy once and be set for many years. 

I’ve narrowed it down to these two machines and I was hoping to get some advice on which to buy. 

I’m not too interested in modding the GCP straight out of the box but it’s a possibility in the future. 

The most troubling thing for me is that I’m not sure if the Profitec Go performs so much better than the E24 GCP to warrant spending ~$600 extra (Profitec Go is $1050, GCP is $450). 

I plan to mainly drink medium roast Americanos, and I’m not big on milk drinks because I’m lactose intolerant so steaming isn’t a huge concern. 

In my use case I think the PID on the Profitec is mainly a consistency thing rather than for experimenting. 


I’d mainly make coffee for just myself, but occasionally have a couple of guests over. 

Anyone have good experiences with a stock GCP E24? In the enthusiast community it’s hard to tell if a stock GCP is actually lackluster or if it’s perfectly satisfactory for the majority of coffee fans. 

Bonus points for the GCP because WLL is running a promotion that throws in a bottomless portafilter and brewista scale. 

I’ve also been thinking that a refurbished Profitec Go is a good middle ground but they seem to be hard to come by. 

P.S. I’ve set aside a separate budget for a good grinder. ",1,1752118339.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1lw2loo,https://i.redd.it/8a2a06sauybf1.jpeg,walang ginawang mali si Sara sabi sa COA Report ayan oh -UNMODIFIED OPINION ang nakasulat. mga 8080 kasi kayo!!! -DDS,"Heto nga yung sinasabi ko the other day—kailangan nating maging mapagmasid.  
  
Sa panahon ngayon, napakahalaga ng kakayahan nating kilalanin ang mga pattern ng maling mpormasyon, lalo na bago pa man ito tuluyang magsimula o lumala.  
  
Sa kaso ng OVP at ni Sara Duterte, malinaw na may namumuong pattern ng misinformation campaign na nilalayon hindi lang linisin ang pangalan, kundi itago ang mga kasalanan sa likod ng technical na lengguahe at audit reports.  
  
■ ANO ANG COA AT BAKIT MAHALAGA ANG KANILANG MGA ULAT?  
  
Ang Commission on Audit (COA) ay isang independent constitutional body na itinatag ng 1987 Constitution ng Pilipinas.  
  
Ang mandato nito ay mag-audit at mag-examine ng lahat ng accounts ng gobyerno, kabilang ang mga revenue, receipts, at expenditures.  
  
Binubuo ito ng isang Chairman at dalawang Commissioners na may pitong taong termino.  
  
Sila ang ""Supreme State Audit Institution"" na nagsisiguro ng transparency at accountability sa paggamit ng pondo ng bayan.  
  
■ MGA TERMINO SA COA REPORTS: UNMODIFIED AT MODIFIED OPINION  
  
● Unmodified Opinion (Unqualified Opinion):  
  
Ito ang opinyon ng COA kapag ang financial statements ng isang ahensya ay ""prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.""  
  
Ngunit mahalagang tandaan: ang unmodified opinion ay hindi nangangahulugang walang mali o irregularities.  
  
Sabi ng COA, ""an unmodified opinion does not necessarily mean that there were no misstatements found during the audit nor there were no uncorrected misstatements as at year-end.""  
  
○ Modified Opinion:  
  
Ito ay ibinibigay kapag may mga material misstatements o kulang ang ebidensya. Kasama dito ang qualified, adverse, at disclaimer of opinion.  
  
● Ano ba ang Qualified, Adverse, at Disclaimer of Opinion  
  
• Qualified Opinion  
  
Ibinibigay ito ng auditor kapag, maliban sa ilang partikular na isyu, ang financial statements ay maayos na naipapakita sa lahat ng mahahalagang aspeto.  
  
Ibig sabihin, may isang bahagi kung saan hindi sumasang-ayon ang auditor o kulang ang ebidensya, ngunit sa kabuuan ay maaasahan pa rin ang financial statements.  
  
• Adverse Opinion  
  
Mas seryoso ito—nangangahulugan na nakita ng auditor na may malalaking pagkakamali o misstatement sa financial statements kaya hindi nito wasto at tapat na naipapakita ang kalagayang pinansyal ng ahensya.  
  
• Disclaimer of Opinion  
  
Ibinibigay ito kapag hindi nakakuha ng sapat na ebidensya ang auditor upang makapagbigay ng opinyon, kadalasan dahil sa malalaking limitasyon o hindi matukoy na impormasyon. Sa ganitong kaso, hindi nagbibigay ng anumang opinyon ang auditor tungkol sa financial statements.  
  
Ang mga uri ng modified opinion na ito ay nagsisilbing babala sa publiko at mga stakeholder na may seryosong isyu o limitasyon sa katumpakan o kabuuan ng impormasyong pinansyal na inilahad.  
  
■ NOTICE OF DISALLOWANCE: ANO ITO AT BAKIT ITO MAHALAGA?  
  
Ang Notice of Disallowance ay dokumentong inilalabas ng COA kapag may nakita silang transaksyon na ""irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, at illegal.""  
  
Kapag may disallowance, kailangang bayaran ng mga responsable ang halagang nadisallow sa loob ng anim na buwan.  
  
Ang notice na ito ay isang paraan para mapanagot ang mga opisyal na nag-approve ng mga questionable na gastos.  
  
■ ANG KASO NG OVP AT DEPED: SARA DUTERTE SA GITNA NG KONTROBERSYA  
  
● Confidential Funds at Irregularities  
  
Noong 2022, ginastos ni VP Sara Duterte ang P125 million confidential funds ng OVP sa loob lamang ng 11 araw.  
  
Ayon sa COA, P73.287 million dito ay nadisallow dahil walang sapat na dokumento na nagpapatunay ng ""success of information gathering and/or surveillance activities.""  
  
Bukod dito, may mga natuklasang acknowledgment receipts na may mga pangalang halatang peke tulad ng ""Mary Grace Piattos,"" ""Kokoy Villamin,"" at ""Oishi,"" na walang birth records ayon sa PSA.  
  
Sa DepEd naman, ang confidential funds na P112.5 million ay na-encash gamit ang tatlong checks na tig-P37.5 million bawat isa—isang pattern na hindi rin naipaliwanag ng maayos.  
  
● Impeachment at Congressional Investigation  
  
Noong Pebrero 2025, na-impeach si VP Sara Duterte ng House of Representatives dahil sa:  
  
\- Malversation ng P612.5 million confidential funds  
\- Betrayal of public trust  
\- Unexplained wealth  
\- Publicly admitting to an assassination plot laban kay President Marcos  
  
Ang impeachment trial ay naantala sa Senado, na nagdulot ng batikos mula sa mga eksperto at simbahan.  
  
■ MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN: PAANO GINAGAMIT ANG UNMODIFIED OPINION BILANG PROPAGANDA  
  
● Strategic Misrepresentation  
  
Ang unmodified opinion ng COA ay ginagamit na ngayon bilang political shield.  
  
Ginagamit ito ni Sara Duterte at ng kanyang mga kaalyado para sabihing ""cleared"" siya sa lahat ng isyu, kahit malinaw na may mga disallowance at irregularities.  
  
May mga social media posts na nagsasabing:  
  
\- “COA DID NOT FIND ANYTHING IRREGULAR! UNMODIFIED OPINION PA NGA!”  
  
\- “Flawless, unblemished certification of financial integrity”  
  
\- “Proving beyond doubt that her office is run with honesty”  
  
● Coordinated Social Media Amplification  
  
Ayon sa Cyabra, isang AI research firm, halos one-third ng mga X accounts na nagpo-post tungkol sa Duterte controversies ay fake accounts, na interlinked para magpalakas ng pro-Duterte messaging.  
  
Maging si Sara Duterte ay nagdepensa sa paggamit ng AI-generated content para sa political support.  
  
● Pattern ng Deflection at Attack  
  
Kapag may lumalabas na isyu, agad na ipinapasa ang usapan sa technicalities ng audit rating at ginagamit ang COA report bilang ""panangga"" sa mga kritisismo.  
  
Ang mga kritiko ay tinatawag na ""political enemies"" at ang mga lehitimong tanong ay tinatakpan ng technical jargon.  
  
■ PAGHAHAMBING: LENI ROBREDO VS SARA DUTERTE SA PAMAMAHALA NG OVP FUNDS  
  
Leni Robredo’s OVP (2016-2022):  
  
\- Total budget: P3.9 billion sa loob ng 6 na taon  
\- Confidential funds: Wala  
\- Security personnel: 78  
\- COA rating: Unmodified opinion for 4 consecutive years  
\- Transparency: Regular na naglalabas ng detalyadong ulat at sumasagot sa mga tanong  
  
Sara Duterte’s OVP (2022-2024):  
  
\- Total budget: P4.2 billion sa loob ng 2 taon  
\- Confidential funds: P125 million (2022, nagastos sa 11 araw), P375 million (2023)  
\- Security personnel: 433  
\- COA rating: Unmodified opinion for 3 consecutive years  
\- Transparency: Tumangging sumagot sa mga tanong, may fake names sa receipts, maraming disallowance  
  
Ang malaking pagkakaiba: Si Robredo ay nakakuha ng unmodified opinion nang walang confidential funds, habang si Duterte ay may unmodified opinion pero may malalaking disallowance at questionable transactions.  
  
■ MGA KASALANAN NI SARA DUTERTE NA NAGDULOT NG IMPEACHMENT AT COA INVESTIGATION  
  
1. Assassination Plot: Publicly admitting na may “contract to kill” laban sa Pangulo at iba pang opisyal.  
  
2. Malversation ng Confidential Funds: P73 million sa P125 million confidential funds ay nadisallow ng COA.  
  
3. Fake Names sa Receipts: 1,322 sa 1,992 na pangalan sa OVP receipts ay walang record sa PSA.  
  
4. Betrayal of Public Trust: Tumangging sumagot sa mga tanong ng Kongreso at hostile behavior sa hearings.  
  
■ BAKIT DELIKADO ANG MISINFORMATION NA ITO?  
  
Ang paggamit ng technical na wika at audit reports bilang panangga ay hindi lang simpleng propaganda. Ito ay isang sophisticated na disinformation campaign na naglalayong:  
  
\- I-twist ang kahulugan ng COA reports  
  
\- Gamitin ang “unmodified opinion” bilang smoke screen  
  
\- I-deflect ang usapan mula sa tunay na isyu ng corruption at irregularities  
  
\- Magpalakas ng artificial support sa social media  
  
Ayon kay dating COA Commissioner Heidi Mendoza, “hanggang sa ngayon nga, nung nakikita \[ko\] yung extent ng disinformation, I couldn't believe \[it\]… Pati yung audit report, may twist, 'di ba?”  
  
■ PATTERN RECOGNITION: MGA WARNING SIGNS NA DAPAT BANTAYAN  
  
1. Technical terminology na ginagamit bilang propaganda  
  
2. Coordinated fake social media accounts  
  
3. AI-generated content para sa artificial support  
  
4. Pag-deflect ng usapan mula sa core issues  
  
5. Pag-atake sa mga kritiko at whistleblowers  
  
■ KONKLUSYON: ANG TUNAY NA HAMON SA DEMOKRASYA  
  
Hindi sapat ang unmodified opinion kung may malalaking irregularities at disallowance.  
  
Ang mga kasalanan—malversation, fake names, assassination threats—ay hindi natatakpan ng audit rating.  
  
Kailangan nating maging vigilant at marunong kumilatis ng patterns ng misinformation.  
  
Ang demokrasya ay nangangailangan ng informed citizens na hindi basta-basta nalilinlang ng technicalities at propaganda.

1lw2i9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lw2i9s/is_it_expensive_to_eat_out_in_maui/,is it expensive to eat out in maui?,"Just got back from Maui and wanted to share my experience with food costs since I see this question pop up a lot. I spent 2 weeks there and ate at various places, from local spots to high-end restaurants.

The short answer: Yes, eating out in Maui is generally expensive compared to mainland prices, but there are ways to manage costs.

Here's what I found:

Breakfast:
- Local coffee shops: $5-7 for coffee, $12-15 for basic breakfast
- Hotel restaurants: $25-35 per person
- Food trucks: $10-15 for breakfast burritos
- Local bakeries: $3-5 for pastries

Lunch:
- Plate lunches: $15-20
- Food trucks: $15-25
- Casual restaurants: $20-30 per person
- Beach bars: $18-25 for sandwiches/burgers

Dinner:
- Mid-range restaurants: $30-50 per person
- High-end restaurants: $75-150+ per person
- Local spots: $25-35 per person
- Luaus: $125-175 per person (includes entertainment)

Money-saving tips I discovered:
1. Hit up local markets for breakfast supplies
2. Food trucks offer great value
3. Happy hour deals are your friend (usually 3-6 PM)
4. Plate lunches can easily feed two people
5. Book tours that include meals

Speaking of tours, one of the best values I found was the Road to Hana tour I took. It included a fantastic farm-to-table lunch at Hana Farms (their stone-oven pizza is amazing), plus snacks and drinks throughout the day. When you factor in not having to rent a car or worry about gas, it's actually pretty reasonable. I booked through [this link](https://athometouch.com/Maui) and had an awesome experience.

Additional tips to save money:
- Costco near the airport has great prices
- ABC stores are cheaper than hotel shops
- Many food trucks offer local discounts
- Download restaurant apps for special deals
- Consider splitting entrees (portions are huge)

Hidden gems I found:
- Paia Fish Market
- Local fruit stands along highways
- Farmers markets
- Food courts at Queen Kaahumanu Center
- Local plate lunch spots away from tourist areas

The key is balancing splurge meals with budget-friendly options. While food costs are higher than the mainland, the quality is usually excellent, especially for fresh seafood and local produce.

Remember, eating out is just one part of your budget. Tours and activities often include meals, which can help offset food costs while maximizing your experience. Like that Road to Hana tour I mentioned - it's a full day of adventure with meals included, making it a great value.

Bottom line: Budget about $50-100 per person per day for food if you're eating out for most meals. You can spend less by cooking some meals or more if you're hitting up fancy restaurants every night.",1,1752117796.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

Cutting out coffee has decreased my appetite and I’m finding it hard to reach my goal,"I changed my diet drastically (for me it was a drastic change cause I was pretty much drinking coffee from morning till night and then having some meal at night. The issue was when I drink coffee I used to put 5 teaspoons of sugar in each cup , and I would drink around 4-6 cups a day and then it would create this unpleasant feeling in my stomach and I can’t sleep so I would eat something at night . I wanted to change this cause I’m a short woman and sticking to 1200 calories a day is impossible when you get like 500 calories from sugar alone. So I started drinking this chocolate milk which is made with non fat milk + cornstarch + water and then I would add a zero calorie sweetener. The whole jug contains about 500 -600 calories but the issue is this lasts me about two days usually and since I’ve started drinking this I’m never hungry. The sucralose aftertaste in my mouth doesn’t really make food appetizing either. But my appetite seems to have gone away. I only started this to move away from all the coffee and sugar and I have planned a whole volume eating salad routine but I have no motivation anymore cause I’m not hungry and I’m scared I won’t get nutrition cause I’m not eating anything anymore really, cause my goal was to eat as many greens and vegetables as possible and all healthy fat and stuff. Cause my whole life I’ve eaten crap and vegetables are sucha a rarity in my diet and I desperately want to change it. 
does anyone have any advice for me. I can’t go back to coffee . It was a hard addition to break. ",0,1752117707.0,1200isplenty,12,0.5,False

1lw2gfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lw2gfo/i_work_night_shift_at_a_rural_post_office_and_i/,I work night shift at a rural post office… and I can’t blink after midnight.,"Have you ever been handed a piece of paper that felt heavier than lead—like it carried the weight of your own doom? Or been told to follow rules so bizarre, so downright bone-chilling, that you started questioning whether you were awake or trapped in some fevered nightmare? I have. And I swear on everything I hold dear, I wish I never had.

My name’s Tommy. A plain, forgettable man in a plain, forgettable life. Thirty-eight years on this earth, and nothing much to show for it except a mailman’s uniform, a pair of scuffed boots, and the silence that comes from being single in a small town. No kids. No wife. No wild stories to tell—or at least, not until that night. See, I work the graveyard shift at a creaky little post office in Mill Creek. A place so small, even the stray dogs know everyone’s business. Population hovers at two thousand—on a good day, if you count the drifters and the dearly departed resting up on the hill. It’s the kind of town where nothing happens. At least, nothing that folks are willing to talk about.

But let me tell you—there was one night. One night that cracked open the quiet like a coffin lid. The night I learned the rules weren’t just some oddball tradition. They were a lifeline. A set of commandments carved out to keep death—and worse—at bay.

It all began at exactly 10:03 PM on a Thursday evening that smelled of rain and regret. I remember the time clear as day, because I was punching in at the old brass clock on the wall, the one that ticks too loud in the silence. That’s when Marvin—old Marvin, who’d manned that shift longer than I’ve been alive—handed me an envelope so yellowed and brittle it looked like it might crumble to dust right there in my hand. His face? I’ll never forget it. Pale as chalk. Eyes hollow, like he’d already seen what was coming for me.

“You sure you wanna take over the night shift, son?” His voice cracked like dry timber.

I tried to muster a smile, though my gut twisted up like barbed wire. “Yeah,” I said, forcing the words out. “I like the quiet.”

But Marvin didn’t smile back. Not even a flicker of one. Instead, with hands that trembled just enough for me to notice, he pressed the envelope into my palm. “Then you’d best read this. Every last word. And don’t you dare cut corners, boy. Not a single one.”

The envelope felt cold, somehow, like it had been waiting in a grave. I opened it, heart thudding in my chest like a drum at a funeral. Inside was a single sheet of paper, yellowed and cracked at the edges. The list was typed in all caps, the ink faded but legible. And what it said… well, it read more like a survival manual than anything to do with mail.

RULES FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT — MILL CREEK POSTAL STATION

1. Clock in exactly at 10:03 PM. Not a minute earlier. Not a minute later.  
2. Lock the front door behind you. Check it twice.  
3. At 11:11 PM, place a glass of milk on the front counter. Do NOT drink it.  
4. The red mailbox outside is for Them. Do NOT touch it.  
5. If you hear scratching from P.O. Box 121, ignore it. Do NOT open it.  
6. Between 12:00 AM and 12:15 AM, do not blink for more than 3 seconds.  
7. At 1:00 AM, you’ll hear a knock at the back door. Do NOT open it.  
8. If a letter arrives addressed to someone who doesn’t exist, burn it.  
9. Lights will flicker at 2:22 AM. That’s normal. Don’t panic.  
10. Never, ever fall asleep.  

I read the list twice, maybe three times, each word sinking into my brain like ice water down my spine. I looked up, expecting Marvin to crack a grin, tell me it was a joke, some kind of twisted welcome to the night shift. But there was no grin. No laughter. Just that haunted look as he stepped backward, like I was already lost to him.

“This some kinda hazing?” I asked, though my voice wavered, betraying me.

“No joke,” Marvin said, voice low and hollow as a grave. “You follow the rules, or you don’t make it to sunrise.”

A nervous chuckle escaped my throat, but it sounded wrong. Hollow. Like it didn’t belong in that room. Marvin didn’t join in. He just turned on his heel and walked out, the door closing behind him with a finality that sounded too much like the slamming of a casket lid. I watched him disappear into the night, not once looking back. And just like that, I was alone. Alone with the list. Alone with the silence that suddenly felt heavy, suffocating.

For a long moment, I stood there, heart hammering, eyes on the paper, mind screaming at me to walk away. But rent was due. Bills don’t pay themselves. And besides—how bad could it really be?

So I folded the list with trembling hands, shoved it into my jacket pocket, and took my first steps into the nightmare I never saw coming.

But tell me—if you were in my shoes, would you have stayed? Would you have followed the rules? Or would you have walked out, and risked whatever was waiting out there in the dark?

Because what came next? What came after that clock ticked past 10:03 PM? That’s where the real terror began…

The first thing I did—my hands trembling ever so slightly as the weight of the night began to settle on me—was lock the front door. Not once, but twice, just like the list demanded. The old brass lock clicked into place with a finality that made the silence of the post office feel heavier, as if the building itself exhaled its last breath and left me to fend off the dark alone.

For a stretch of time, nothing out of the ordinary stirred. I busied myself with the dull routine, trying to convince myself that this was all some elaborate prank, or maybe an overactive imagination fed by too many sleepless nights. I sorted mail with mechanical precision, stacked a few battered packages with care, and tried to drown out the creeping anxiety with sips of bitter coffee that scalded my tongue. The radio crackled in the background, offering nothing but static and the occasional ghost of a melody, as if the airwaves themselves were too afraid to speak.

But time, relentless as ever, dragged its feet toward the next rule. And soon enough, 11:11 PM came calling.

It nearly slipped my mind—the milk. My throat constricted as I swallowed hard, cursing myself for almost forgetting such a simple task. I rummaged through the breakroom fridge, fingers brushing past old sandwiches and forgotten cans until I found it: a small carton of milk, cold and sweating in my grip. I placed it on the front counter exactly as the instructions said, my heartbeat echoing in my ears.

At first, the world remained still. No thunderclap. No unearthly wail. Just the hum of the flickering lights above and the soft tick of the wall clock, each second feeling heavier than the last. But then, out of the corner of my eye, something shifted. My skin prickled with that unmistakable sense of being watched. I turned my head, slow as molasses, and there it was—a shadow. A figure, tall and still, standing just beyond the front window, its outline warped by the dirty glass. I blinked once, heart caught in my throat, and when my eyes opened again, the figure had vanished. Like smoke in the wind.

That was the first time my blood ran cold, icy tendrils creeping through my veins. I told myself it was nothing. A trick of the light. My mind playing games. But deep down, a gnawing dread began to take root. And it wouldn’t let go.

Minutes bled into each other, the silence stretching so thin it felt like it might snap. And then, at precisely 11:40 PM, I heard it. A scratching. Faint at first, like the scuttle of a mouse searching for crumbs. But it grew louder, sharper—claws against metal, deliberate and desperate. The sound came from P.O. Box 121.

Every hair on my neck stood on end as I forced my legs to move, each step heavier than the last. The box trembled, rattling as though whatever lay inside was trying to claw its way out. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at it, mesmerized by the violent shaking. Without thinking, I reached into my pocket for the key, my fingers brushing the cold metal.

But then—Rule 5 screamed at me from the recesses of my mind. Do not open it. The words blazed in my thoughts, as loud as any siren. My hand recoiled as if the key itself had burned me. I stumbled back, breath ragged, watching the box convulse for what felt like forever. And then, just as suddenly as it had started—the scratching stopped. Silence fell, thick and absolute. The kind of silence that makes you feel like even your heartbeat is too loud.

It was in that moment I realized: this wasn’t some game. The rules weren’t superstition. They were my only shield against something I couldn’t begin to understand. I clenched my fists, whispering to myself, No, I can’t risk breaking them. Not now. Not ever.

Midnight arrived like the tolling of a funeral bell, and with it came the most maddening rule of all. No blinking for more than three seconds. My throat tightened as I set a timer on my watch, the glow of the numbers feeling like the only light left in a world that had turned alien. I fixed my gaze on the clock, counting every blink, feeling my eyes dry and burn as the minutes crawled by. Seven minutes in, and it felt like my eyelids weighed a ton, my vision blurring at the edges. But I held on, teeth clenched, refusing to let the rules slip through my fingers.

Until 12:08 AM.

That’s when it happened. Just a second—one second too long. My eyes shut, and sweet relief flooded through me. But when I opened them again, the relief turned to ice.

There, behind the counter, stood a man. Or what was left of one. His uniform, once blue, was torn and stained, hanging off his frame like a shroud. And his face—God help me, his face. It was as if someone had tried to piece together a human face from memory alone and failed. Features misplaced, proportions all wrong. A mockery of a man.

“You’re not Marvin,” he rasped, his voice like gravel dragged across concrete, carried on a wind that smelled of dust and decay.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. My tongue felt thick, useless in my mouth. The figure leaned in closer, empty eye sockets boring into mine.

“You blinked,” he said. Not a question. A statement. A sentence.

And then, just like that, he was gone. As if the air had swallowed him whole.

And that, my friend, was only the beginning. Because the night was far from over. And I had miles to go before I saw the sun. So tell me… would you have blinked? Or would you have stared into the darkness and risked what stared back?

I hit the floor like a marionette whose strings had been cut, the breath knocked clean out of me. My hands scraped against the cold, gritty tiles as I scrambled—half-crawling, half-stumbling—toward the only place that felt like it could shelter me from whatever had just stood behind that counter. The supply closet.

I slipped inside, pulling the door shut so hard it rattled on its hinges, and collapsed against the wall, heart hammering like a drum in a funeral march. The air in that tiny space was stale, thick with the scent of bleach and dust, but I didn’t care. I pressed my back against the shelves, drawing my knees up to my chest, and stared at the thin sliver of light beneath the door, praying nothing would darken it. The seconds dragged on like hours. My breath came in shallow, ragged bursts, each one louder than it had any right to be.

I kept my eyes on my watch. Tick. Tick. Tick. The minutes crawled forward until finally—blessedly—the clock hit 12:15. I forced myself to stand, legs trembling like a newborn fawn’s.

When I stepped back into the main room, the world seemed ordinary again. The air was still. The clock ticked on. No sign of the man with the broken face. No shadows. No whispers. But my heart wouldn’t slow, wouldn’t let me forget that something had been here, breathing the same air, watching me.

And the night wasn’t done with me yet.

1:00 AM crept up like a storm cloud on the horizon. I barely had time to brace myself before it began—the knock. Exactly as the rules foretold. One. Then another. Then a third. Each one louder than the last, reverberating through the building, rattling my bones.

I clenched my jaw, held my breath, frozen like a deer in headlights. And then… came the voice.

“Tommy… let me in, baby. It’s cold. Please.”

My blood ran to ice. That voice. That sweet, familiar voice. My sister’s voice. But that couldn’t be. Couldn’t possibly be. My sister had been dead six years. Buried under a headstone I visited every Christmas.

I backed away from the door so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. Hands clamped over my ears, I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to block out the sound, but the voice seeped in, soft at first, then desperate. The knocking grew violent, the wood groaning beneath the blows. And just when I thought I couldn’t bear it another second—it stopped.

I crumpled to my knees, the weight of it all crushing down on me, and gagged on the bile rising in my throat. I nearly lost what little was in my stomach. My whole body trembled like a leaf caught in a storm.

The next hour crawled by in torturous silence. Every creak of the building, every groan of the pipes, every whisper of wind outside sent my nerves skittering. I started to hum—a broken, tuneless hum—just to drown out the quiet. Just to remind myself I was still here. Still human.

And then came 2:22 AM.

The lights flickered, just as the list had promised. A stutter of brightness, a breath of darkness. I clenched my fists and whispered, “That’s normal. That’s normal.” But my voice didn’t even convince me. When the lights steadied, my eyes darted to the front counter. And that’s when I saw it.

The milk was gone.

My stomach dropped like a stone into a bottomless well. I hadn’t touched it. No one had come through that door. Or so I thought.

Something had.

Driven by equal parts fear and foolishness, I turned toward the red mailbox outside. Rule 4 blared in my mind like a siren—Do NOT touch it. But I had to see. I had to know. The night had already twisted beyond anything I could have imagined. My boots crunched across the gravel as I stepped out into the cold, my breath visible in the frigid air.

The red box stood there, mouth hanging open like it had just spoken some terrible truth. I peered inside, heart in my throat. Empty. Just a hollow space where something had once been—or worse, where something had reached in.

And before I could stop myself, before I could think, I slammed it shut with a bang that echoed through the night and sprinted back inside, lungs burning, blood roaring in my ears.

I leaned against the door, gasping for air, realizing too late what I had done. I’d broken a rule. And in a place like this, mistakes don’t go unpunished.

At 3:03 AM sharp—when the world feels thinnest, like the skin between life and death is stretched to breaking—a sound sliced through the silence. A soft, almost polite shuffle against the floorboards. I froze, breath hitched, as a letter slid under the front door. Just like that. Like it had been handed over by unseen fingers that waited on the other side.

I stared at it for what felt like forever. My hands trembled as I bent down to pick it up, fingertips brushing the yellowed paper. No stamp. No return address. Just a single line scrawled in a crooked hand across the front:

“To: The Man Who Shouldn’t Be Here.”

The words seemed to pulse on the page. I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat refusing to budge. Against every instinct screaming in my bones, I tore it open. Inside, a single sentence stared back at me, stark and cold:

“You broke Rule 6.”

The floor seemed to tilt beneath me. My ears rang. My heart pounded so loud it drowned out every other sound. I remembered Rule 8—burn it. Burn it now. My body moved before my mind caught up. I stumbled toward the breakroom, clutching the letter like it might bite me. The microwave. That was all I could think of. I stuffed the paper inside, slammed the door, and hit start.

The machine hummed, the letter sparking and curling as the flames took it. Acrid smoke filled the room. The fire alarm wailed, piercing the night like a banshee’s cry. But I didn’t care. Let it burn. Let the whole building burn, if it meant ending this nightmare.

Seconds passed like lifetimes. I stood there, sweating, heart galloping in my chest, waiting for something—anything—to change. But the night held its breath.

And then, at 3:30 AM, I saw him.

Marvin. Or what was left of him. His face, pale and ghostly, appeared at the window. Eyes wide, unblinking, staring straight at me. But Marvin was gone. He had left hours ago, hadn’t he? Hadn’t he? I stepped closer, unable to stop myself, drawn like a moth to a flame. The figure at the window didn’t blink. Didn’t move. Just stared. Stared too long. Too still. Too wrong.

My skin crawled. My gut twisted. I killed the lights, plunging the room into darkness, as if hiding would protect me from whatever that thing was. I sank into the shadows, heart pounding so loud I was sure it could hear me. Time stretched, warped. Every tick of the clock felt like it might be my last.

And then came 4:44 AM.

A phone rang.

My blood turned cold. There was no phone at the front desk. Not that I’d ever seen. And yet, there it was. A battered, black rotary phone, sitting there like it had always belonged. The shrill ring cut through the quiet, echoing off the walls. My hand shook as I reached for it, sweat slicking my palm. I lifted the receiver, pressing it to my ear with a dread I can’t put into words.

A voice—dry as autumn leaves, soft as a death rattle—whispered through the line:

“Four more rules. Follow them if you want to see the sun.”

Then, nothing. Just the hollow hiss of dead air.

I stood there, frozen, the dial tone buzzing in my ear, the words replaying in my mind. Four more rules? How could that be? The list was supposed to be complete. I turned in a slow circle, searching for some new list, some fresh instructions. But the room offered nothing. No paper. No writing on the walls. No voice guiding me. I was on my own.

5:00 AM crept in, the darkest hour before dawn. And that’s when I did the only thing left—I made my own rules.

With trembling hands, I scrawled them onto the back of an old delivery slip, each word etched in desperation:

1. Trust your gut. It’s the only thing that hasn’t lied. 

2. Stay in the light. The shadows aren’t empty. 

3. Never believe the voices. No matter how sweet they sound. 

4. When in doubt, run. And don’t look back.

I sank into the chair, the wrench cold and heavy in my grip, knuckles white as bone. My eyes locked on the door, waiting, watching, counting each second like it might be my last. The night wasn’t done with me yet. Not by a long shot.

And now, the question I have for you: If the rules kept changing—if the night kept stacking the deck against you—would you stay and fight? Or would you run into the dark, not knowing what waited for you? The sun was so close. But so was everything else…

At exactly 6:00 AM, as if the universe itself decided my time was up, the front door unlocked with a soft, deliberate click. I didn’t touch it. Didn’t move a muscle toward it. It simply swung open on its own, the hinges groaning like a tired spirit set free. And with it came the dawn. Pale sunlight spilled across the threshold, chasing back the shadows that had kept me prisoner through that cursed night.

I stood there for a moment, too stunned to breathe, watching the light crawl across the floor like salvation. And then, like a man stumbling out of the wreckage of a battlefield, I crossed that threshold, boots heavy, body numb. The cool morning air hit my face, and I gulped it down like a man starved for oxygen. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t.

The nightmare was over. Or so I thought.

Later that morning, after what felt like both an eternity and a blink, I picked up the phone with shaking hands. My mind raced as I dialed the district office, determined to quit, to put this whole godforsaken ordeal behind me. A woman answered, voice brisk and businesslike.

“Mill Creek Post Office,” I began, the words catching in my throat. “I’m calling to resign. From the night shift.”

A pause. Then confusion, plain as day, bled through the line.

“Sir… what office did you say? Mill Creek?”

“Yes. Mill Creek.”

Another pause—this one longer, heavier.

“Sir, the Mill Creek office was shut down. It burned in a fire back in ’98. There’s nothing left there. Hasn’t been for over two decades. Nobody works there.”

Her words echoed in my head like a funeral bell. I didn’t argue. Didn’t ask questions. I simply hung up, the receiver slipping from my grasp, hitting the floor with a hollow clatter that seemed to reverberate through my very soul.

I sat there in silence, staring at the wall, feeling the weight of something I couldn’t name pressing down on me. I still have the list—the original list—yellowed, creased, its edges brittle as ash. I kept it, though God knows why. Maybe as a warning. Maybe as a curse.

As for Marvin? Gone. Vanished like smoke. No one in town remembers him. Not a soul. It’s as if he never existed at all. As if he was just another phantom conjured by that place.

But here’s the part that keeps me up at night, the part that lets me know this isn’t over—not by a long shot. Every Thursday night, without fail, at 10:03 PM, I find a letter waiting on my porch. No stamp. No return address. No footsteps leading to it. Just the letter. Every time.

It says the same thing, week after week, in that same crooked, haunting scrawl:

“Ready for another shift?”

I don’t answer. I don’t touch it. But the truth? The truth is, I know one night I’ll have no choice. One night, the rules will come calling again. And next time… next time, I might not be so lucky.

So tell me—when the rules come for you, will you be ready? Or will you blink, will you hesitate, and let the night swallow you whole?",16,1752117635.0,nosleep,1,0.94,False

The core idea is to help kids and teens learn essential life skills — the kind that are often overlooked in schools but are crucial for growing up confident, independent, and emotionally strong.

I’m in the early stages and looking to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about:

	•	Education innovation

	•	Child and adolescent development

	•	Psychology or curriculum design

	•	Community-based learning

	•	Or just building something meaningful from the ground up

This isn’t your typical EdTech venture — it’s hands-on, practical, and purpose-driven.
If you’re in Bangalore (or open to collaborating here) and this resonates with you, I’d love to connect.

Also, if you’re a parent, I’d genuinely love to hear your thoughts or feedback on this initiative — your perspective means a lot!

Feel free to DM me or reply here — happy to grab a coffee or jump on a quick call!",1,1752117541.0,smallbusinessindia,0,1.0,False

100 days seemed like sooo long. I knew I wouldn’t waver; but DAMN if I wanted to some days. Damn if I’m tempted to try to moderate now. 

100 consecutive days + Dry January = I’ve been sober for most of the year. It hasn’t been a panacea like so many people have claimed. 

I still struggle with my mental health. 

I have continued to lose weight, but it wasn’t like it melted off over night. Most of it I lost while still drinking. 

I’m more productive, but still don’t have tons of energy. I’m drinking coffee daily now. 

I feel like I register others’ problems more and their energy weighs heavier on me than before. 

I miss the buzz. I miss the taste of alcohol. 

BUT

I’m relieved not to add hangovers to the mix of my existential dread. 😅

My liver enzymes dropped more than half. 🙀 Totally in the healthy range now.

Before her, my only real love was nature. The balance, beauty and chaos of life. The middle of the woods has always been my temple; quiet to the sounds of man, but loud with the sounds of birds, bugs, and frogs. After so many dates and relationships that felt.. empty, like something was missing. Honestly, I had given up on the whole idea of love. I quit my job in the city, trying to save the environment (and us) from climate change from a D.C. office had proven futile, and with the impending doom of the incoming administration’s war against nature, I needed fresh air. I needed to clear my head, rethink my life, and pivot into something that actually fulfilled me spiritually. 

And then I met her. I was leaning up against a planter outside the coffee shop next to her apartment building and she was coming down to meet me. The air was electric, my heart was racing, but I was trying as hard as I could to act casual. It wasn’t more than a few minutes waiting for her to come down the elevator, but it felt like ages. Then, there she was. Everything went silent, like when you’re driving up a mountain and your ears are about to pop. A few paces forward and as we met, I lifted her and her legs wrapped around me. She was weightless; I was weightless. Our faces came a few millimeters apart and we didn’t say a word. Just breathed. That breath was the start of my life. The first *actual* breath I ever took. Every cell in my body was vibrating. Not an alarmed vibration, but a deep, calm hum. I was home. We just stayed like that. We didn’t kiss. I don’t know if we even said, “hi.” I don’t know how long it was. Maybe a minute, just breathing and giggling. We had never met before, in this life, but everything felt as if I had known her forever. When I finally put her down, it was like stepping out of the house in the Wizard of Oz. Everything was different, as if I was just seeing color for the first time. 

Then I felt myself split right in half. I had just signed a lease in Colorado. We had a month. She knew it. Actually, it's the only reason she finally decided to meet me. As she was too busy in her professional career to entertain my consistent texts like a puppy who needs a walk. I didn’t blame her. I was crazy about her from the first message. That first breath, though. The moment I looked into her eyes, I knew this was different. Did she feel it too? My whole world turned upside down. I played it cool and walked on the ceiling. I drove upside down all the way home. It still hasn’t flipped back the right way.

I was lost. I was lost before, getting ready to pack up my life and move across the country, but now.. She was everything. Everything I was leaving this city to go find. The wonder, the complexity and the mystery of mother nature in her entirety; All in the eyes of this little girl. She is a foot shorter than me, but has the gravity of the moon. Enough to make entire oceans swell with the tides. I could swear that her mood controls the weather. It rained that entire month. Maybe she did feel it too.

We pretended like everything was okay, we laughed and swooned the whole month long. Then it got down to the last week. She asked me not to go. She almost begged for a moment. I felt myself tear farther apart. It killed me. I didn’t want to go any more. I had to. Partly for that half of myself that was pulling that way, and partly because I had already made the commitments to the lease, my roommate. I was lost. She was home, and I was leaving. 

“It’s just a year, we can keep this flame alive.” I begged her, “I will come back to you.”

I meant it with every bone in my body. For a little while she believed me. 

We made it almost two weeks before she said it was too difficult. Really I didn’t blame her, but it was devastating all the same. I was naive for thinking she would stick around for a guy like me. I’m 30, with my head in the clouds. I’m a broke philosopher with dreams, who moved across the country with no job. I’ve got a degree, a good attitude and work ethic, I know I’ll find my way. Who knows, if I find a good enough job and get myself a career fast enough, maybe I’ll get her back and this story will continue.

Walking around with a pit in my stomach like a part of me is missing, but I don’t want that piece back. I gave it to her willingly. If she never comes back to me, I’m happy to have the reminder that she is out there somewhere existing, even if it hurts. Life is funny that way, I suppose.",1,1752116762.0,love,1,1.0,False

**Other notes/Mentions:**

* If you can make the time, look around Campus/Granville Towers a few days after the school-year ends, as people will throw things out like mattress toppers, lamps, and decor that's too big to bring home that you can pick up.

* **Download CH Transit on your phone to figure out bus routes**, keep a lookout for the RU & U buses as those will be the one’s driving around north/south campus most of the time.
   * Use the CW bus if you want to head up to Carrboro, the small town west of Franklin Street. It's a mile walk from campus.
* There are also buses in the evening called P2P express buses you can take, they’re white buses that cycle between South campus and Franklin street.
* If you live on South Campus, **they have a Starbucks at the hospital if you’re looking for an alternative place to grab coffee/breakfast**. It's about a 5-10 minute walk
* If you have a game console you want to pair wifi with, use this page to help you set up wifi for it [https://tdx.unc.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=45#ConnectingTVGameSystemPrinterToAnnualUNC-PSK-Wi-Fi](https://tdx.unc.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=45#ConnectingTVGameSystemPrinterToAnnualUNC-PSK-Wi-Fi)

I want peace but I feel trapped,"There’s a girl in my office I’ve liked for a long time. Over time we got close  casual hangouts, coffee, sometimes even shopping. I confessed my feelings to her. She politely rejected me, and I respected that by stepping back.

But after some time, we somehow fell back into the same pattern. She got comfortable again. We’d talk about life, her problems, everything. I tried to stay casual, but deep down I knew I was getting emotionally attached again.

I started noticing another guy in her life  someone she clearly prioritizes. That triggered jealousy, anxiety, and honestly, a lot of pain. So I tried to step back once more.

But here’s the truth: I feel stuck in this loop. My mind replays everything. I overthink, I overanalyze, and every time I try to detach, something pulls me back. Maybe it's the hope, maybe it's the bond I don't even know anymore.

I’m mentally exhausted. I’m not sleeping well. I feel like I’m in a constant emotional hangover, just dragging myself through the day.

I've cried. Some days I couldn't even get out of bed. 
I feel like such a fool for letting myself get so attached. For not being more careful when I didn't know where you stood. But I wanted to be hopeful. I wanted to believe it was real. Because it felt so good to be with you. You made me feel safe and special. I thought if I tried hard enough I could keep it alive.
Look where that's gotten me now.
If only you had figured it out earlier, maybe I would have been spared some of the pain.
At least it didn't go on longer I guess.
I'm not going to tell you all this because it's not all your fault. I still think you're kind and mean well. I am young and naive and thought everything was perfect because I've never experienced anything like that before. I knew you were older and more experienced than me, but your confidence and kindness allowed me to feel safe and be vulnerable with you.
I'd never been cuddled to sleep. I'd never woken up next to someone and they've made me coffee. I'd never cuddled while watching tv with someone. I'd never showered with someone. I did all those things with you. I thought you liked me. I still think you did, but that wasn't enough. 
I wish we could have communicated better. I wish we told eachother all our worries and doubts and made everything more clear. I would hope that we would have worked it out that way, maybe we wouldn't have, but at least then I wouldn't have felt so blindsided by you.

Have gradually ramped up drinking to the point where I consume an entire box of wine in 1.5-2 days. Start at 9am and continue throughout the day. I have toddler twins that I drop off and pick up from daycare. I use coffee and brush my teeth to cover up my drinking but suspect it doesn’t really do the trick. I work from home which sort of enables me to drink throughout the day. On days when my wife also works from home, she has no idea I’m drinking.

I drank nearly a whole box of wine in a single day recently (equivalent of 4 bottles).

I don’t get hungover anymore. But I do forget things. I miss work meetings sometimes, and other times attend them and have no recollection of what I said. That scares me. Being a “high-functioning alcoholic” means my tolerance level has reached a record high.

I drink out of habit and I think need. It’s an urge I need to fulfill. I want to stop but feel I lack the agency to do so.

I’m irritable and angry sometimes after I drink and am completely self-aware of this every time. It’s affecting my family.

I did a work health screening this week and my glucose and non-HDL cholesterol levels were alarming. They weren’t as high last year.

Now title is “discussion about health”,"Yesterday I made Paneer cheesy maggie with caramelised onions and half boiled egg after a long time, it’s been a while since I last cooked/baked(apart from making dosas, idly, coffee, etc..,)

I love cooking but lately this intense heat makes me to procrastinate it. Nanbargale, just think about your parents/partners withstanding the heat and preparing everything for you, please do not take it for granted; try to appreciate them regularly.

Now coming to the point:

Yesterday I was able to make this dish and enjoyed while watching “Dinner With Sathyeah”, I have been putting off watching that video for days just because I wanted to pair it while eating this dish.

That video was very relatable for me, I used to make those dishes and pretend like I invented it; I encourage everyone who doesn’t cook to try cooking/ baking it’s fun, therapeutic, you can experiment and invent new recipes.

Past few days were worse for me, I literally had a breakdown in public but somehow managed to marachufy (hide) it from others, but today I had a good time, had a good meal, watched a wholesome video

I thank Sathyeah for that video, I request you to please continue this series. I wish I could ride my bicycle to somewhere like you mentioned, but there is no such place nearby.

Now a note to JK, I am so sorry that you are going through this, I can understand how hard it must be, I am glad that you got to unburden. 

I hate when people do this, like constantly pressuring others, talking shit about them just because they are famous. Like who gave these assholes right to abuse anyone, I know this is how internet works but abusing people is unfair and unacceptable!

I was devastated to hear you were a S* victim, I am sorry for what you had went through, I hope everything goes well for you, keep doing what you like; it’s okay if you need to take a break, I hope people will understand it

Guys your health is more important than anything else, so please take care of yourself, keep thriving, sometimes things will be bitter but everything will eventually heal it just takes time, please do not take any harmful decisions

Anyone can reach out to me if you need someone rant/vent out or talk to.

Or if you don’t feel like sharing things with strangers, you can reach out to Chatgpt, trust me when I say this, gpt supports you exceptionally and it is way better than any other ai(P.S.: this is not a sponsored content or something, I use gpt for years now, from the time Open AI released it)

TL;DR:

Try to appreciate your parents/partners for their efforts

Encouraging people to try cooking/baking

Appreciated Sathyeah for his post

A note to JK about recent issue

Requesting everyone to take care of their health (both mentally and physically), things will change overtime, so keep thriving until then

Bupropion is a dogshit med along with SSRI’s.I have been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety and whatnot. Mostly against my will when I was underage. The only diagnosis I sought out was ADHD because I recognized that it impeded with my ability to do well in school. I also struggle with SUD. I mostly believe that ADHD coupled with SUD has caused me to develop depressive and anxious symptoms. Due to some inconveniences I have had to join a mental health program and they first prescribed me some Lexapro but I decided to switch to bupropion since I had heard it helped with attention. I have been and to some extent still am very much against taking antidepressants, especially SSRI’s due to their side effects and dependance liability. I don’t want to become dependent on a drug that makes me a shell of my former self, makes me fat, numb and doesn’t even make me feel good, that’s why Ive self medicated through drugs,and alcohol. I’ve found that in my experience I have felt depressed when my life sucked. I believe that depression in my case has been entirely circumstantial. So a pharmaceutical drug might help to give me that push but the rest is entirely up to me. I have been reading reports of bupropion increasing suicidal thoughts and behaviors in both pediatric and adult populations, which is very concerning to me. I have actually been struggling with these thoughts as of recently which is lines up with this research. This drug also seems to lead to cognitive decline— it is an acetylcholine antagonist, which is why it is effective in smoking cessation (it essentially mitigates the reward you get from nicotine) and this can lead to difficulty in cognition, memory, and attention. So a drug that increases dopamine and adrenaline, but decreases the binding of acetylcholine being used for ADHD is just really stupid to me. When I go without adderall, I just use copious amounts of caffeine and nicotine to function at 100%. Something like bupropion reduces the efficacy of nicotine, and makes my heart pound when I drink coffee, and I have experienced little to no benefits to focus or depression… This drug is trash for me and I would not like to continue its use as it is potentially harmful to cognition with no benefits and high potential of terrible downsides. I will stick to low dose adderall, working out, cigarettes and coffee.

I am open to healthy discussion and criticism

TLDR- I believe depression is more circumstantial than mental or an issue of neurotransmission, I dislike most psychiatric drugs other than Adderall and other true stimulants. Bupropion has had no effects on me and is potentially harmful to cognition. I will stick to caffeine and nicotine and will continue to cycle on and off of adderall.",1,1752115854.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,2,0.6,False

Hope this inspires/helps anyone who might want to take a trip like this, and I'd be happy to answer any questions though I feel like it's pretty clear haha. It was cheap too, regular GoWild fare of $30.62 roundtrip and the bus fare was $5 for the full day. Everything else such as souvenirs and food was optional so you could bring your own meals and easily make it a very budget friendly trip. Frontier also gave everyone a digital $15 meal voucher due to the delay, and a $50 flight voucher only to be used on airfare, which is not very useful for GW unfortunately but it's something at least.

Would he?

Every muscle in my body went rigid, my heart plummeting to my stomach. I didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.

----------------------------
AMARA
Being Alexander Hayes’ little secret was worth every sacrifice, every moment of hiding, and every challenge. He had given me everything I never thought I could have. He helped me escape the crushing debt left by my late parents, pulled me from the gutters, and offered me a life of luxury I never dreamed possible.
For the past three years, I’ve been living in the shadows, keeping our relationship a secret. But it never bothered me. I didn’t care about being unseen, as long as I had his undivided attention when it mattered most. As long as he made time for me, remembered my birthday, didn’t forget the little things either—like knowing when my monthly cycle arrived, sending me chocolates, and showing me how much he cared in his own way.
He made sure I had the best of everything—my wardrobe always stocked with the latest trends, and my collection of diamonds and gold growing with each passing month. I didn’t need to ask for any of it. He just made sure I had everything I could ever want.
And at the end of every day, I went to sleep knowing one simple thing: he was mine. That was all that mattered.
Don’t get me wrong, Xander never actually said he loved me—those words never crossed his lips. But in the way he showed up for me, in the little gestures, I knew he cared. 
The few times I crossed paths with his family, or perhaps I should say the few times his family just so happened to run into me while I was at his place, it was always awkward. They never liked me, and I could see it in their eyes, the way they looked down on me. But Xander never let that bother him. He never once hesitated to stand up for me, even if they didn’t understand why.
My thoughts were interrupted by the sudden chime of my phone beside me. A smile immediately spread across my face, and without hesitation, I set the bottle of oil down, the one I was using to massage into my skin, and grabbed the phone. I knew exactly who it was—Xander, of course.
I had no friends, and I wasn’t the type to mingle with others. The few people I interacted with, aside from him, were mostly just distant acquaintances. 
The message popped up, and I couldn’t help but grin as I read it:
“I’M ON MY WAY HOME. YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING WHILE STOPPING BY YOUR PLACE?”
Xander had been away for a month on a business trip, and I’d missed him terribly.
I quickly typed back, “YOU DON’T HAVE TO GET ME ANYTHING, I’M NOT HOME.”
My lips couldn’t help but stretch into an uncontrollable grin. The thought of surprising him, of him walking into his apartment and finding me waiting for him in his tub, covered in oil—well, it thrilled me. 
The phone buzzed again, pulling me out of my daydream. His message flashed across the screen:
“WHERE ARE YOU AMARA? I KNOW YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.”
It was almost funny how well he knew me. I couldn’t hide anything from him, not even the smallest detail. It felt like he had a way of seeing right through me.
“I AM OUT OF TOWN TO HAVE A BIT OF GOOD TIME ALONE, AND MAYBE HOPEFULLY MAKE FRIENDS.”
Biting my lower lip, I stared at the screen, waiting for his response.
“I HOPE YOU MAKE FRIENDS TOO. CALL ME WHEN YOU GET BACK SO I CAN SEND SOMEONE TO PICK YOU UP.”
The words made me smile again. 
Who wouldn’t want that kind of attention? Who would want to leave with this kind of gesture?
“THANK YOU,” I typed quickly before putting the phone down.
I picked up my wine glass and took a sip, but before it could get down my throat, I heard the doorbell. 
I frowned, puzzled. 
It couldn’t be Xander—he won’t ring the doorbell in his own house.
“That had better not be his mother,” I muttered under my breath as I reluctantly pulled myself from the warm water. 
Reaching for my robe, I wrapped it around myself and quickly tied the sash before making my way downstairs.
I reached the bottom of the stairs just as I heard a female voice echo through the hallway. “Is Xander home?”
Grace, the housekeeper, responded in her usual calm tone. “No, not yet. He hasn’t been home in a month.”
Why was Grace giving out so much information? 
Frowning, I rounded the hallway to stop at the first-floor landing. From there, I leaned against the railing, my gaze fixed on the woman in the living room below.
I’d never forget this woman. She was Xander’s first love, the one who came before me. The one who, if I were honest, haunted me in the back of my mind. Xander had just broken up with her when we started seeing each other, and he had made it clear from the start that I was nothing more than a rebound. I didn’t care back then—but now… now, I cared. More than I wanted to admit.
Maybe I had convinced myself that Isabelle was gone for good—that she was a part of Xander’s past that would never resurface. Maybe that was why I never really felt threatened by her before. But standing at the top of the stairs, watching her in the living room, l felt uneasy.
I took a deep breath and straightened my back before walking down the stairs to confront her. I didn’t care who she was anymore; I wasn’t going to let her waltz back into Xander’s life without making it clear that I wasn’t backing down.
“Who are you?” I demanded, playing the part of someone who had no idea who this woman was. “And what are you doing here?”
Isabelle slowly turned her head towards me, her gaze meeting mine with a calm, almost amused expression. 
There was something about her—something that told me she wasn’t just a blast from Xander’s past, but someone who still had a place in his life. She looked me up and down with a soft, stoic expression on her face. “You must be Amara.”
I raised an eyebrow. How the hll did she know my name?
As if she had read my mind, Isabelle smiled, a slow, knowing smile that made my stomach twist. She stood up from the couch and started walking towards me. She made her way up the stairs, closing the distance between us. “Xander told me a lot about you.”
My face twisted in confusion and irritation. “I beg your pardon?”
Isabelle stopped right in front of me, her eyes trailing slowly over my body. I felt her gaze starting from my oiled-up legs and moving upward, lingering for a moment longer than I was comfortable with. She paused at my face, her lips curving into a small, amused smile. “Xander mentioned you a few times,” she mused. “I guess the rebound sx between you both was really great for him to have mentioned you a few times when we were having a conversation.”
I was left speechless, my mind racing as I tried to process the words she had just thrown at me. How was I supposed to react when I found out that the man I had been sleeping with—and, perhaps foolishly, starting to care about—had been discussing our private moments with his ex?
Isabelle smiled, clearly enjoying the discomfort she was causing. “Don’t look so surprised, love,” she taunted, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You aren’t the first rebound relationship he’s had since we broke up. However, you are going to be his last—especially since he’s been hinting at marriage and kids.”
What. The. Fk. Was. Happening?
Xander had been talking about marriage and kids with her? How was I supposed to take that?
I crossed my arms in front of me, trying to appear stronger than I felt. “Xander isn’t home right now, so I think you should come back later.”
Isabelle’s eyes locked onto mine. “I know he’s on his way from the airport.” She deadpanned, her voice even, unbothered. “After all, we’ve been communicating.”
I had never heard Xander speak to her, not once. 
“You don’t believe me?” Isabelle asked with a mocking chuckle, clearly enjoying the way she was getting under my skin. “How did you think I got to know about your affair with him? Something the public doesn’t know?”
I hated myself for even beginning to doubt my own understanding of the situation. Slowly, her words began to take root in my mind.
I forced myself to stay calm. “Like I said, Xander isn’t ho—”
“He hinted at getting married and having babies, then told me to come home.” Her voice dropped lower, raspier, as she took a step forward, closing the small space between us. “What do you think that implies?”
“I’m going to have to ask you to leave,” I gritted out.
Isabelle chuckled again while nodding, stepping back as if she had accomplished exactly what she’d set out to do. “I came here today to give you some advice, and I think I’ve done just that. If you want to remain with him and get hurt, then please, be my guest.”
With that, she turned on her heel and sashayed out of the house, leaving me standing there, seething in her wake.
And just like that, everything that had been building up in me—the excitement of seeing Xander, the plans I’d been making—was ruined. The mood for tonight was completely destroyed.
AMARA
Yes, I did not wait at home for Xander to come back that day.
Yes, I know I might be sulking right now, but honestly, I don’t care. Not even a little. Not only did I leave Xander’s house that day, but I’ve been avoiding him ever since. I’ve even lied to him, telling him that I’m not in the city while, in reality, I’m holed up in a hotel just a few miles away from his place, trying to sort through my feelings and clear my head.
It took one final phone call from him earlier today to make me realize how badly I was handling this.
I was letting my jealousy and insecurities get the best of me. I was overreacting, letting the words of some woman—a woman whose version of things might not even be true—dictate my actions.
How could I let her make me question everything I had with Xander? He’s always been there for me. He’s been supportive, caring, and consistent. If he wanted to move on, if he was serious about being with someone else, I was sure he would have enough respect to tell me about it.
Right?
Pulling into the parking lot of a random restaurant, I made up my mind. I was going to surprise Xander tonight. I didn’t tell him I would be coming over, but I thought it would be a nice gesture to surprise him and dinner.
I turned off the engine, stepped out of the car, and walked inside, placing an order for take-out. Afterward, I sat down, waiting for my food to be prepared.
As I tried to relax, scanning the room and letting the hum of the restaurant calm me, my gaze landed on a familiar face. Isabelle. I recognized her instantly.
But she wasn’t alone.
Xander sat across from her, looking completely at ease. His shoulders were relaxed, a sign that they were having an easy, comfortable conversation—one that made me feel like an intruder just by witnessing it. Isabelle laughed at something he said, and without hesitation, reached out to touch Xander’s hand. He didn’t pull away. He let her.
My chest tightened with hurt, jealousy, and maybe even a little anger. Why was she still so close to him? Why was he letting her touch him like that?
I felt my hands ball into fists at my sides, but I stayed rooted to the spot, not moving. I couldn’t approach them. I couldn’t let him see me in this state. Xander had always made it clear that we were supposed to keep things private and not make us public.
That was the only rule Xander had ever given me, and as much as I wanted to ignore it, I knew I had to respect it. I couldn’t break that boundary, no matter how much it stung.
Taking a deep breath, I reached for my purse, my fingers trembling slightly as I fished out my phone. With my eyes never leaving Isabelle and Xander, I dialed his number, hoping for a response. 
The seconds dragged on like hours as the phone vibrated in my ear, and I saw Xander reach into his chest pocket, pulling out his own phone. He glanced at the screen, said something quietly to Isabelle, and then abruptly disconnected the call.
My chest tightened. Xander never ignored my calls unless he was in an important meeting. 
I dialed his number again, desperately hoping for an answer, but once again, he disconnected the call before it could even ring properly.
I scoffed, the sound bitter and full of pain.
“Ma’am,” a voice called out, his tone polite, “your order is ready.”
I blinked rapidly, forcing myself to tear my gaze away from Xander and his… date? Or whatever she was. Forcing a smile, I gave a tight nod. “Thank you,” I muttered, barely managing to get the words out.
I took the order quickly and turned quickly, trying to escape before they could see the pain etched on my face. I needed to leave before I got caught, before I allowed myself to break.
***************
Seated in the dining room, a champagne flute in my hand, nearly filled to the brim, I stared blankly at the dinner in front of me. My appetite had completely disappeared, replaced by a gnawing emptiness in my chest that I couldn’t shake off.
The sudden sound of the door beeped, pulling me from my thoughts. I blinked, slowly turning my gaze toward the sound, and heard Xander’s familiar voice call out, “Amara?”
I looked up just as he appeared in the hallway, his tall frame standing in the doorway. He walked toward me, his usual warmth radiating from him. “How are you home?” he asked, his voice gentle as he came over to kiss my cheek. “You should have told me, so my driver could pick you up.”
I forced a smile, not wanting to ruin the moment, though it felt hollow. Xander never offered me love—not the kind I wanted. I had no right to be upset. None.
“I did call you, but you didn’t answer,” I replied as I stared at his face, searching for any sign of guilt or acknowledgment.
Xander pulled his phone from his pocket and scrolled through it for a moment, his brow furrowing slightly before he slipped it back into his pocket. “I was in an important meeting.”
With Isabelle, I thought bitterly.
I couldn’t stop myself. “You usually text whenever you’re in an important meeting,” I pointed out softly.
Xander pulled out a seat beside me and sat down, casting a quick glance at the food on the table before letting out a soft chuckle. “Please tell me you didn’t make this.”
I followed his gaze, unable to hold back a small laugh myself. “Of course I didn’t,” I replied dryly. I had spent so much time trying to take care of myself from a young age that I’d never bothered to learn how to cook. Cooking just wasn’t in my skill set.
“I’ll quickly take my shower and come down,” he said, completely ignoring my earlier remark. He gave me a gentle kiss on the temple before standing up and heading toward the stairs.
I stayed seated for a moment, but curiosity gnawed at me. Instead of waiting for him to come back, I stood up and followed him upstairs. Maybe it was just the need to fill the silence, maybe I was just looking for answers to questions I hadn’t yet asked.
As I walked into the room, I quietly made my way to the closet, reached for the jacket he just wore out, picked it up and slipped my hand into the pocket.
The crinkling of paper caught my attention, and I pulled out an invoice from JK Jewelry. My heart skipped a beat as I read the details: Necklace – Paid in full.
He bought a necklace. For whom? Was it for me?
Brows furrowing, I quickly searched through his pants, but when I didn’t find the necklace, I grew even more uneasy. My steps took me to the drawers next. Part of me still didn’t want to believe that Xander could have bought it for Isabelle, but deep down, I knew it was starting to make sense. 
When I didn’t find the necklace anywhere in the room, that sinking feeling in my gut told me what I didn’t want to admit—I might have been right.
He might have actually bought the necklace for Isabelle.
I placed the invoice back in his jacket pocket, trying to shake off the ache in my chest. Almost out of the closet, I froze as I heard his phone chime from the bedside table. I didn’t touch it—there was no need to. The message was visible on the screen, clearly readable without unlocking it.
It was from Isabelle.
“THANK YOU FOR TODAY, AND THANK YOU FOR THE GIFT, I REALLY LOVE IT AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU REMEMBERED WHAT TODAY WAS. I WON’T FORGET NEXT WEEK, IT IS A DATE.”
Next week? What on eаrth was happening next week? What was she referring to? 
I heard the sound of the bathroom door creaking open, and in a panic, I quickly turned off the phone screen and rushed back to my side of the closet, trying to steady my breath. 
I heard his footsteps shuffling, and then they abruptly stopped. “Amara?” He sounded surprised to find me there. “I thought you’d be waiting in the dining room.”
I grabbed a sweater off the shelf, waving it in his direction. “I was feeling a bit cold,” I lied.
“Cold?” His hand touched my shoulder, and I stiffened slightly at the unexpected warmth. “I can warm you up.”
Not tonight. Not after everything I had learned. “How about we get through dinner first?”
He kissed my hair softly, a gesture that used to melt me but now felt hollow. “Sure.”
Pulling out of his hold, I walked briskly out of the closet, hoping that by the time he joined me, I could bury this sudden heaviness and convince myself it didn’t matter.
XANDER
I never really imagined myself getting married. It wasn’t something that ever crossed my mind as a priority in my life. But now, in this moment, with everything happening around me—my parents pressuring me, the board constantly breathing down my neck—suddenly, the thought of it doesn’t seem all that bad. Maybe marriage is the answer, or at least the solution they all want me to find. They expect it, and I’m starting to feel like I have no choice but to follow through, no matter how foreign the idea feels to me.
“It’s a good thing you didn’t bring that blonde gold-digger with you tonight,” my sister, Laura, said, her voice tight with irritation. She forced her lips into a smile, but her eyes betrayed her frustration. 
She was careful, making sure her expression remained neutral, fully aware that the cameras were always watching, ready to capture anything that could be twisted or misinterpreted. “I still don’t understand what you see in her.”
My face remained as cold and unreadable as it had been since the moment I walked through the door. “If you want me to avoid you the entire night, then keep talking,” I said flatly.
Laura, not at all impressed by my stoic response, muttered under her breath, though I caught every word. “And of course, you always defend her,” she spat out, clearly annoyed.
She paused, the bitterness in her voice growing more evident. “It’s a good thing you don’t let her show her face in public. You know as well as I do how much damage her identity could do to your reputation if seen together in public.
I ignored Laura completely, directing my attention to Isabelle, who was engaged in an interview with the press on the opposite side of the hall. Her eyes met mine, and she smiled warmly, which I returned with a genuine smile of my own.
“A child of a p'imp will always remain one.” Laura emphasised in a low tone and my brow immediately furrowed in disbelief.
I spun around to face her, my patience snapping. “Shut your fcking mouth if you have nothing reasonable to say,” I snapped. “Your husband fks every woman he can get his hands on. Shouldn’t you be more worried about that and the damage it would do to your reputation?”
That was it. I was done with her for the night. Without waiting for a response, I grabbed a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and made my way toward the other end of the hall, where Isabelle was still talking to the press.
As I neared her, I noticed a slight tension in her posture. She kept rubbing the pendant of the necklace I had bought her the last time we were together. She was nervous, perhaps unsure about something.
“You keep rubbing that pendant,” the interviewer remarked, noticing Isabelle’s repeated gesture. “Is there a special sentiment attached to it?”
For a brief moment, Isabelle’s eyes flicked to mine, but she quickly averted them, her smile never faltering. “Yes, this necklace holds significant meaning to me. It was a gift from someone very important,” she said, her voice soft.
I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her, the glass in my hand now a mere distraction as I absently twirled the champagne inside.
The interviewer shifted the topic. “Are you planning on staying in New York after the launch of your new product, or will you be returning to Mexico?”
Isabelle’s smile widened, and I noticed the subtle change in her demeanor as she answered. “The original plan was to go back to Mexico after the launch, but things have changed,” she said, her tone slightly more serious. “Now, I intend to stay here for a very, very long time.”
The interviewer raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “What changed?” she pressed.
Before Isabelle could respond, I heard my mother’s voice beside me. “That had better be you,” she mused, her voice full of approval as she glanced between Isabelle and me. “Isabelle is the ideal daughter-in-law for this family.”
“I know what’s best for myself and for this family,” I stated, finally bringing the glass of champagne to my lips but just as I was about to enjoy the drink, my phone vibrated in my pocket.
I pulled it out, my eyes briefly scanning the name flashing on the screen—Amara, saved in my contacts as ‘A.’ With no hesitance, I reached to swipe the answer button, but before my finger could make contact, my mother’s hand landed on mine with surprising force.
“Is she the one calling?” she asked, her voice deceptively calm.
I shot her a sharp glare, irritated beyond measure. “Stay out of my fking business, will you?” I hissed. “Isn’t it better to have one woman in my life than to be fkn my way through New York?”
The silence settled between us for a moment before my mother’s voice softened, taking on an almost honeyed tone. “Senator?” she called out with the widest smile. “Your daughter has done a marvelous job with the new oil launch.”
I bit my tongue, forcing myself not to snap back. Isabelle’s father, Mr. Zealot Joe, was one of the most respected businessmen in the country, and despite my frustration with my mother’s intrusion, I knew better than to disrespect him.
“Congratulations on a successful launch,” I said, extending my hand for a handshake. Mr. Zealot Joe accepted it firmly, a small but appreciative smile playing on his lips.
“It’s nice to have you here, Alexander,” he said, his voice welcoming. As we exchanged pleasantries, our attention was drawn to his daughter, Isabelle, who had now taken the stage to speak to the gathered guests. She stood tall and poised, ready to say a few words. “She told me you two are getting along well,” he added, nodding toward her.
I nodded back, my gaze briefly meeting Isabelle’s before returning to her father. “Yes, we are. It was about time.”
Mr. Zealot Joe nodded in agreement, tapping my shoulder lightly with a gesture of approval. “I’m having a birthday dinner for my wife next week. Be sure to show your face.”
“Isabelle already sent an invite, so I’ll be there for sure,” I assured him, and he seemed satisfied with my response.
With a final nod, he excused himself, turning to walk away. I stood there for a moment, processing the conversation when my mother’s voice interrupted my thoughts.
“I’m glad you took my advice,” she chimed in from beside me, and I hadn’t even realized she was still standing there.
“I’m glad Zealot is being friendly toward our family again,” she continued, her tone hinting at some sort of satisfaction, as if everything were falling into place the way she always expected it to.
“Don’t you have friends to greet?” I asked through clenched teeth, barely hiding my irritation. I wasn’t in the mood for her company, especially not now.
She didn’t seem fazed by my tone. “Are you doing it anytime soon?” she shot back.
I glanced at her briefly from the corner of my eyes, wondering what she was talking about. “Doing what anytime soon?”
“You know exactly what I’m talking about,” she said, clearing her throat, the cryptic nature of her words only making me more frustrated. “Don’t play dumb with me, son.”
“How about you don’t be so cryptic with me?” I snapped.
She sighed dramatically, a smirk tugging at her lips. “The engagement,” she deadpanned, looking me square in the eyes. “Are you proposing anytime soon? We need that union to happen soon.”
I let out a long, controlled breath before responding. “Yes, I will propose,” I said, stressing the words. “But it’s up to me to decide when.”
She groaned in frustration. “Xander, now is not the time to be stubborn. Having a union between the Jeos and our family is going to benefit both parties.”
I met her gaze, my expression flat. “I believe it will benefit them more than it benefits us,” I remarked.
“Doesn’t matter,” Mum argued, her tone persistent. “At the end of the day, we’re still getting the benefits.”
Already feeling the headache creep in, I sighed and placed my half-empty glass on the tray of a passing server. “I believe I’m done here tonight,” I said, my voice curt as I turned away from her.
She frowned, clearly not pleased with my decision. “The party just got started,” she remarked, trying to draw me back into the fray.
I didn’t even look at her as I replied, my patience completely worn thin. “Well, it’s over for me.” Without another word, I turned on my heels and walked towards the entrance.
The moment I stepped out of the building, I took in a very deep breath, feeling the headache calm already.
It wasn’t until I got in the car did I remember Amara called me earlier. Since I was already heading home, I decided not to return the call and meet her in person instead.
However, the ride home took longer than expected because of an accident which caused a road block.
AMARA
“Are you sure there isn’t a relative or a friend you can call to pick you up?” the nurse asked me for what felt like the hundredth time, her brows furrowing with concern.
I glanced down at my phone, the screen still displaying my unanswered calls to Xander. A tired sigh escaped my lips as I shook my head. “No, there’s no one. But I’m fine, really.” I have been in worst state in the past and I survived.
The truth was, I had almost been hit by a drunk driver while walking down my street to get some ice cream. It had all happened so fast—a screech of tires, the blinding headlights, my body frozen for a split second before I stumbled backward just in time. But in the end, nothing truly terrible had happened. No broken bones, no serious injuries—just a shaken-up version of myself sitting in the emergency room, convincing a nurse that I could manage on my own.
She didn’t seem convinced. I could see it in the way her brows pinched together, the slight hesitation in her posture. She probably thought I was too rattled to be left alone, that I might unknowingly walk into another moving vehicle.
“Thank you for everything,” I said, pushing myself up from the chair and reaching for my jacket. My fingers trembled slightly, but I ignored it. “You made all of this a little easier to deal with.”
The nurse offered me a kind smile, the kind that held warmth but also a hint of worry. “I was just doing my job,” she said softly.
I nodded and turned toward the exit, my steps slow as I made my way out of the hospital. 
Should I go to Xander’s place or just head back to my apartment?
After much contemplation, I realized I didn’t want to be alone tonight. The silence of my apartment would only magnify the unease in my chest, and I so much need a company right now, so I hailed a cab and headed to Xander’s house instead.
***************
When I arrived, the house was quiet—too quiet. Xander wasn’t home.
With a sigh, I made my way to the kitchen, brewed myself а cup of warm tea, letting the steam rise to my face in an attempt to calm my nerves. But the unanswered calls still bothered me.
I hate that subconscious self that keeps telling me that he is with Isabelle.
After taking a few sips, I decided to find out where he was. Stepping outside, I approached one of the security guards stationed near the entrance.
“You know where your boss is?” I asked, hoping he won’t blow me of off with responses like…he isn’t supposed to report his boss’s whereabouts to me.
The man gave me a curt bow before responding. “He’s at the launch event for Wember Oils.”
Wember Oils.
The name alone made my stomach twist. The company belonged to Zealot Leo—Isabelle’s father. And where he was, she was bound to be as well.
That is a fact, judging from the Isabelle I met a few weeks ago.
So that was why Xander wasn’t answering my calls. He was with Isabelle.
I swallowed down the bitter feeling creeping up my throat and forced a tight smile. “Thanks.”
Turning away, I walked back inside, setting my half-empty tea on the coffee table before sinking into the plush sofa. A long breath escaped me as I pulled out my phone, scrolling through the internet in an attempt to distract myself.
But no matter how hard I tried, my mind kept circling back to one thought—he ignored me for her.
As if the universe itself wanted to mock me, my media feed was flooded with videos of Isabelle.
I hesitated for a moment before clicking on one. The screen came to life, showing her standing under the bright event lights, poised and elegant as always. A journalist held a microphone to her lips, and with a dazzling smile, she announced, “I’m here to stay for good.”
My stomach tightened.
But what really caught my attention wasn’t her words—it was the way her fingers kept grazing the pendant of her necklace. A necklace I knew all too well.
I didn’t need anyone to tell me it was the one Xander had given her. The confirmation came when she glanced at the camera, her smile turning almost coy as she murmured, “It was a gift from someone very important to me.”
A scoff slipped past my lips before I even realized it.
Exhaling sharply, I turned off my phone, flipping it face down on the sofa as if that could block out the thoughts racing in my head. 
A quick glance at the clock told me that I’d be spending the night alone—something I had wanted to avoid in the first place.
*************
The soft creak of the bedroom door stirred me from sleep. The quiet shuffle of footsteps followed, moving closer until a familiar scent wrapped around me.
Then, a cold pair of lips brushed against my temple.
I kept my breathing steady, feigning sleep. Not because I was tired, but because I couldn’t bear to let him see how much his behavior with Isabelle was affecting me.
Because if he saw—if he knew—I wasn’t sure I’d be able to handle his response.
“Mum?”
His voice, sharp with irritation, pulled me from my thoughts. Peeking one eye open, I saw him standing by the window, his phone pressed tightly against his ear.
“I already told you—I’ll be proposing to her soon.”
Proposing?
My breath caught in my throat.
“I know you like Isabelle, Mum, but you’re seriously getting on my nerves with these constant reminders,” he snapped before abruptly ending the call. With a frustrated sigh, he tossed his phone onto the sofa.
I barely had time to shut my eyes before he turned around.
I listened as he walked into the closet, rustling through his belongings. A few minutes later, he emerged, heading straight into the bathroom. Moments later, the sound of running water filled the silence.
I remained still, my mind racing.
He’s proposing to Isabelle?
A dull ache settled in my chest, but I pushed past it as I slowly sat up. My gaze flickered toward the closet.
I had never been the type to snoop. Never felt the need to dig for answers that weren’t freely given.
But after what I’d just heard, I needed to know—was I wasting my time? Was I holding onto something that was never mine to begin with?
With careful steps, I walked into the closet, reaching for his jacket. My fingers trembled slightly as I searched through the pockets, bracing myself for whatever truth I was about to uncover.
I pulled his wallet from the closet, my heart pounding as I rushed to the door, checking quickly to make sure he wasn’t coming back yet. I opened the wallet with trembling hands, scanning through it until my fingers brushed against a crumpled receipt tucked away at the back.
Curiosity gnawed at me, and with a deep breath, I unfolded it.
The words on the paper made my breath catch in my throat. A receipt for a ring.
A sob lodged in my chest, and I quickly pressed my hand to my mouth to stifle the cry threatening to escape.
He was planning an engagement with Isabelle. After all the times he told me that he would never get married, after all the promises he made to me… He was out there making plans with her. And here I was, sitting on his bed like an idiot, waiting for him to return.
Like some… some bimbo.
My vision blurred, but I wiped my tears away quickly, forcing myself to focus. I slid the receipt back into his wallet, but in my haste, the wallet slipped from my hand.
It hit the floor with a soft thud.
I sniffed, my heart still heavy in my chest as I bent to pick it up. That’s when I saw it—a picture, partially hidden beneath the wallet.
Curious, I reached for it, my fingers shaking as I turned it over.
My fingers trembled as I picked up the photograph, flipping it over. My eyes scanned the image, and my heart sank as I froze in place.
It was an ultrasound image.
A freaking ultrasound image!
And right above it, in bold letters, were the words Isabelle Leo.
She was carrying his child.
How could he hide something like this from me? Was he ever going to tell me about it? 
This was the reason they were getting married. It wasn’t just about love—it was about a future they were building together.
They were already building a family together. Without needing to be told, I knew. It was over for me.
The sound of the shower turned off, snapping me back to the present.
Panicking, I quickly placed the photograph back where I had found it, stuffing it into the wallet before hurriedly placing it back into the jacket. My heart was pounding in my ears as I rushed back to the bed, lying down and closing my eyes. I forced myself to keep my breathing steady, pretending to be asleep just as Xander entered the room.
He climbed into bed beside me, his body warm as he pulled me close against his chest.
And for the first time since I met him, his arms didn’t feel safe anymore.

The sound it makes when grinding beans is very ethereal, or hollow, quite unique, and highly recognizable.

However, it always feels like squeezing facial cleanser that gets stuck halfway through. You have to turn it upside down or tap it a bit. It constantly stutters while grinding; the number of stutters per grind seems to depend on the beans, but almost all beans cause some hesitation. Towards the end, there are always half a bean or a few half-beans rattling around in the bean hopper, requiring me to shake and change positions to finally get all the powder out.

Once the grinding is finally done, when pouring the grounds, I don't know what's wrong with that glass powder jar, but there's always coffee powder clinging to the threads and edges. It invariably reminds me of how the nozzle of a facial cleanser tube always gets a small ring of residue after squeezing.

I even started to wonder if my C40 was a fake, though I'm sure the seller would pull out their authorization papers and sue me if I actually said that.

# ZP6

Its reputation isn't nearly as widespread as the C40's, but it's truly reliable at getting the job done. It feels very solid to crank, not overly strenuous, but a bit heavier and faster than the C40. It rarely stutters; this is also bean-dependent, but only a very few beans will cause occasional stutters.

Pouring the powder is also very clean, with no sticking to the outer wall.

Additionally, ZP6's external adjustment dial is much more convenient, and its body is slimmer than the C40's, making it easier to grip for people with smaller hands.

\-------

However, all the beans I use are medium-light roasts.

As for the coffee brewed from the grounds of both, I've compared them carefully several times. My ZP6 at 51 clicks is roughly equivalent to C40 at 18 clicks. I used a V60 Switch for brewing to minimize significant interference from inconsistent technique. The flavor is indeed very different from C40. ZP6's flavor is concentrated; the ""Bear Estate Geisha Washed"" tasted full of sweetness with a clear tea-like aftertaste, reminding me of a cylinder. C40, on the other hand, was like a flat disc, broader but more subdued. If I had to choose which one I prefer, for this specific bean I compared, I would choose the concentrated flavor of the ZP6.

However, if I wasn't brewing simultaneously and comparing side-by-side, I might struggle to define what a bean ""should"" taste like, or whether C40 or ZP6 performed better; I could only say they were different.",6,1752115647.0,1zpresso,0,0.88,False

I eventually confessed that I had feelings for her. She politely rejected me saying she didn’t feel the same way.

After that I stepped back out of respect for her and to protect myself. But after a few weeks we somehow slipped back into that same dynamic again. The chats started the hangouts returned and I found myself back where I didn’t want to be.

She’s extremely comfortable around me. She shares a lot even the emotional vulnerable stuff. And while I care for her I started noticing signs of someone else in her life maybe someone she actually likes or gives priority to. I won’t lie it makes me feel jealous and small. Like I’m just there as a fallback or emotional support.

So I decided to completely back off again. But something is holding me back. Maybe it’s the memories or the false hope or just the emotional connection I’ve built.

I keep overthinking and overanalyzing everything. I don’t even know what I want from her anymore love clarity closure? But what I do know is
I want peace. I want freedom from this mental mess.

The Quiet Test

**Leo**

I don’t like being seen.

Not in the fake, dramatic, teen-movie kind of way. I mean it literally. I’ve gone whole school years without teachers remembering my name. Sometimes they mark me absent when I’m sitting right there. I’ve waved. Spoken. Nothing.

People forget me.

I used to think it was just how I looked — boring, pale, forgettable. Or maybe how I sounded — soft, like I didn’t believe in my own voice.

But now… I’m not so sure.

Because this morning?

People looked.

Tasha glanced at me like I was solid. Gabe bumped into me and actually apologized. Even Danny, who usually stares at the floor like it holds all life’s answers, met my eyes for half a second.

It shook me.

Like falling upward.

I don’t like being seen.

⸻

My uncle didn’t even see me.

Not really.

He shouted something about eggs as I slipped out the door. He wasn’t making them — just shouting the word. Again. For the fourth time this week. The man drinks vinegar like it’s wine and calls the microwave “The Orb.”

He’s all I have.

No parents. No siblings. Just a great-uncle who probably thinks I’m a hallucination from a dream he had in 1974.

And maybe I am.

Maybe that’s why I feel… blurry.

Like the world draws itself clearly for everyone else, but smudges around me.

Or maybe I just need sleep.

⸻

When I got to school, everything felt louder.

Brighter.

Wrong.

I stepped into the classroom, expecting the usual — no greetings, no glances, just my seat in the back and a sea of people looking through me.

But something was different.

The second I walked in, the air shifted.

Gabe dropped a coin mid-flip.

Tasha blinked and sparked.

Danny rubbed his nose again, like he felt a storm coming.

Even the teacher… paused. Just slightly.

Like someone unplugged a thought mid-sentence.

I kept walking.

Sat in the back.

No one looked.

No one said anything.

But they felt me.

And I felt them feel me.

And that was worse than being invisible.

That was dangerous.

⸻
**The Teacher** 

She showed up ten minutes early.

Of course she did.

Director Reyna always arrives early — not because she’s efficient, but because she likes people to know she’s efficient.

“Zenos,” she said, her voice syrupy and sharp, like a compliment dipped in lemon juice. “You look… conscious. Excellent.”

“Reyna,” I replied, resisting the urge to fake a seizure.

She fluttered in like a pastel moth, clipboard in hand, hair sprayed to hell, smile tighter than my last paycheck. “The Council will be joining us shortly. I trust your little group is… presentable?”

“They’re students. Not puppies.”

“So, no.”

I sighed…

She leaned closer, lowering her voice. “Zenos, this is important. You’ve been making waves. Some positive. Some… less so. Today is your chance to prove this Class F experiment wasn’t just a glorified detention hall.”

I took a long, painful sip of my coffee.

She smiled wider. “They just need to be competent. Not impressive. Barely functional will suffice.”

“Well, that’s our specialty.”

⸻

The Council arrived in silence.

Three of them. Always three.

James. Joseph. Russell.

You don’t forget those names once you hear them. You don’t forget them once you see them.

They’re not just top-ranked heroes. They run the damn Academy. The kind of presence that makes security guards stand straighter and weather change direction.

James wore black. Always. Silent. Cold. More stone than man.
Joseph had the look of a surgeon who knew everyone in the room was already dying.
Russell smiled like he was trying it out for the first time and wasn’t sure if it fit.

They said nothing.

Just nodded once.

And that was enough to make my hands sweat.

⸻

I ushered the kids into the simulation room.

Some shuffled. Some bounced. Some looked like they were walking into a dentist’s office with a fire alarm going off.

Most of them had powers only their mothers could love.

Bea had “sugar clairvoyance.” She claims she can taste danger in gummies.
Trent builds static when anxious, which means he’s a lightning rod 24/7.
Mina can make plants grow by sneezing. Not helpful.
Clint can unbuckle seatbelts with his mind. That’s it. That’s the power.

This is what I work with.

Except for a few — the ones I’m starting to believe in:

Tasha, Gabe, Danny, Livia… and Leo.

Especially Leo…

Because nothing about that boy makes sense.
And today, I’m going to find out why.

⸻

**Zenos The Teacher**

The room lit up in blue.

Turrets hissed open with lazy timing. Platforms shifted. Drones hovered at safe-but-annoying altitude.

I’d kept it simple: a five-minute challenge meant to test reflexes, teamwork, and maybe — just maybe — not get anyone concussed in front of the Council.

Reasonable, right?

Not even fifteen seconds in…

Gabe flinched too early. Fired a shockwave straight into the nearest wall. Tasha yelped, sparks flicking out from her palms like angry fireflies. Clint tripped on the floor tile he swore had “moved,” which it hadn’t.

Trent tried to generate static, forgot to ground himself, and promptly zapped his own ankle. Again…

Danny managed to dodge a drone, but then overcorrected and headbutted a padded wall. Which shouldn’t have bled. But did.

And Leo?

Leo just walked…

That’s all.

Just a few steps across the field.

And suddenly, the whole room felt wrong.

I blinked and forgot which turret I’d programmed to fire next.

Joseph narrowed his eyes, already scribbling something down.

Russell smiled wider.

James… didn’t move. But somehow, his lack of motion felt louder than all of it.

Then came the second wave of dysfunction.

Bea screamed because she “had a vision of cereal raining from the ceiling” and panicked. Nico flickered in and out like a corrupted gif. Mina sneezed — and a weed sprouted from the wall panel beside her.

I muttered through gritted teeth: “So much for controlled variables.”

Livia, bless her, was sketching mid-motion like it would help the others navigate. Tasha backed into her on accident, knocking the sketchpad flying. Danny reached to grab it midair — and for one second, his blood followed.

Like a red thread arcing across the chaos.

James leaned forward.

I didn’t breathe.

Then Leo blinked…

Just blinked.

And the lights dimmed for half a second. Everyone froze like someone hit pause on reality.

Even the Council looked… unsettled.

Just for a blink.

And then it was gone.

⸻

**Zenos The Teacher**

I hit the shutdown button before someone accidentally invented nuclear sneeze propulsion.

The lights flickered back to steady. The turrets retracted. The walls stopped shifting. A low, merciful hum of deactivation filled the room.

And silence followed.

Not relief.

Not triumph.

Just… silence…

The kind you hear at funerals. Or just before a suspension letter hits your inbox.

I looked at the Council.

James didn’t blink.
Joseph kept writing.
Russell clapped. Once.

“You’ve got spirit,” he said.

I wanted to punch him and throw up at the same time.

Behind me, the kids started relaxing. Laughter bubbled. They thought it was over. That they’d passed. That it went okay.

They had no idea.

No idea that Gabe nearly tore a wall down.
That Danny almost weaponized his blood mid-panic.
That Leo glitched a room just by being there.

I turned toward them.

“Alright. Not bad. Better than yesterday. Go hydrate. Don’t touch anything. Especially yourself.”

They laughed.

They laughed.

Gods help me.

The Council didn’t say a word as they left.

James passed by me like I was air.
Joseph nodded — surgical.
Russell leaned in. Voice low.

“You’ve got something here, Zenos. Something ugly. Something raw. Don’t polish it too soon.”

Then he was gone.

The room dropped ten degrees.

Behind me, the kids were arguing about who nearly died most impressively.
Leo sat in the corner.
Staring at the wall.

And I?

I rubbed my eyes and said nothing…

Because I wasn’t ready to ask the real question yet:

I don't need anything from my dad, but he's never given me anything.   He bought my daughter a small gift,  but you could tell my dad was forced by his wife.

One day I asked if he could grab me and my wife a coffee and he acted like it was the end of the world.

I did read FAQs but my situation wasn’t included. 

Have been sleeping with a girl for the past week. I’ve used a condom every time with no problems but on Sunday or Monday (I’m in New Zealand, today is Thursday) I was removing myself but the condom had partly slipped off, can’t give exact measurement but would be at least 2-3 inches still covered. 

After I pulled out, sperm was leaking out of her. We were surprised, but I didn’t think she could get pregnant because the condom was still on and there was no force to push the sperm inside (she was on her back).

Yesterday she told me she’s had increased urination for 2 days, almost every hour or so. I would have thought that it was too early for pregnancy symptoms to start, but she’s also been drinking coffee for the last week which I know can increase urination and it had also been a year of no sex for her before me so I’m assuming it could be a hormonal thing?

1lw1fq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lw1fq1/it_was_never_just_a_building_to_us/,It Was Never Just a Building to Us,"Wally was 23 when he first picked up a shovel to build a Kingdom Hall in his small North Carolina town. The year was 1983. The congregation had 38 publishers, a patch of donated land, and not a cent to spare. But they had something stronger than money: conviction.

Brother Ernest gave the land, an old farmer with cracked hands and a soft heart. He couldn’t quote many scriptures, but he always said, “If it’s for Jehovah, you give him your best.” When he handed over the deed, he cried. Not out of loss, but out of joy.

Every weekend, Wally and the brothers worked from sunup to sundown. Young guys slept on the floor to guard the tools. Sisters brought food in foil pans, balancing rice and beans in their arms like sacred offerings. Kids ran around, dodging wheelbarrows and pretending to be on construction crews. They laughed. They prayed. They believed they were building something holy.

When a storm ripped half the roof off one night, Wally stood in the mud, soaked to the bone, trying to save what he could. He sobbed quietly. Then he got back to work.

They finished in 11 months.

The hall wasn’t much to look at; cinderblock walls, modest chairs, a small bathroom that always smelled faintly of bleach; but it was theirs. It was sacred. They called it Jehovah’s house.

Wally proposed to Janet in the parking lot. He baptized both his sons in that tiny blue pool. He gave talks with sweaty palms, painted the walls every spring, and helped fix every broken mic wire. His life happened in that building.

Until one day, decades later, a letter came.

No explanation. No thanks.

“The Kingdom Hall will be sold. Your congregation will merge with another. Additional details to come""

No meeting. No elders’ visit. Just a cold letter from Brooklyn.

Wally was 62. He sat in the same back row where he’d cried the day his mother died. No one spoke. No one knew what to say.

They sold it for $350,000.

Today, it’s an acupuncture clinic. The sign says “Balance & Energy Wellness Center.”

No acknowledgment of the sweat, the prayers, the history.

Just gone. That was his last day on that Hall.

Wally didn’t say much after that, but he was never the same. Just once, over coffee, to his son, he whispered:

**“I once built a house for God. Now I don’t know who lives there.”**",52,1752114463.0,exjw,9,0.98,False
