The coffee I usually get is the 7 Eleven sugar-free French Vanilla latte or Mocha (if someone has the sugar content on both of these, that will probably help make it easier to let them go as anything over 9g of sugar in a single food item freaks me out). I will allow myself to have artificial sweeteners like sucralose and stevia up until the point where I will remove my daily coffee. If someone has any tips/motivation, that would be much appreciated!

So today… I woke up, and the universe clearly had other plans for me.

You’re absolutely crushing it, and here I am just trying to keep my coffee from spilling. 🙃

1inav2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1inav2q/frustrated_about_getting_diagnosis/,Frustrated about getting diagnosis,"I have had the following symptoms for nearly 7 years and have tried navigating a diagnosis through the very slow Canadian healthcare system. 

Acute attacks lasting 30ish minutes happen usually in middle of night:

Nausea
Gnawing abdominal pain and sometimes cramping. 
Feeling lightheaded/gonna pass out
Diahrrea over and over 
Vomiting over and over 
Intensely itchy palms
Itchy back
Runny nose
Prickly feeling on my skin
Feeling hot, then feel cold after
Episode ends once the vomiting and diahrrea has run its course. 
These acute attacks started during pregnancy, they know sometimes happen outside pregnancy. Eating ground beef during pregnancy is one confirmed food that will cause this attack.

I’ve ruled out kidney stones, gallbladder issues, h pylori, and recently had an endoscopy which was normal. I am waiting for a follow up with GI after they took biopsies from my gut. Hoping they are being tested for MCAS. 
Tryptase level came back at 11.3 (this was during a non flair up)

The past few months I now get daily symptoms such as itchiness on torso (it increases after eating certain foods), horrible bloating and nausea after foods such as scrambled eggs, caffeinated coffee, strawberries. 

I saw an allergist recently who I was referred too. Allergy prick test for foods all came back negative. I was deflated to hear her tell
Me she doesn’t treat MCAS and believes it’s an over diagnosed condition. She also felt my symptoms didn’t match with MCAS. Which I found very annoying. She is willing to test me for HaTs but the gene testing will likely be many months before results return. She also wants me to get my tryptase re tested within 30 minutes to 2 hours after an attack. Which is laughable because 99% of my acute attacks happen in middle of the night when the lab is closed. The hospital isn’t an option as it’s usually several hours wait to get tested there. 
I have suspected MCAS for a while now. My family doctor put me on antihistamines and my daily symptoms of itchiness and nausea were suppressed but after 1-2 weeks I was having breakthrough symptoms. I ended going off Rupal because I was too fatigued and it was also drying up milk supply for my baby. The allergist is having me try another antihistamine. She claims that they don’t affect milk supply and that it’s strange I experienced that. I have read the contrary is possible. I feel annoyed and even gaslight. Depending on my results from the Hats or the new test for tryptase, she recommended I see a hematologist.
I feel frustrated from going doctor to doctor for so many years and trying to get to the bottom

The employees? They are not rude. They are not kind. They simply are. They exist in a state beyond caring, beyond mortal concerns. You could order a Whopper and receive a single cold onion ring in a coffee cup, and when you question it, they will stare through you like a ghost haunting its own grave.

The soda machine dispenses flavors never before known to man. The fries are either soaked in grease or turned to dust. And the nuggets? Brother, do not ask about the nuggets. They are not of this earth.

And yet, despite all of this, people keep coming back. Why? Nobody knows. Maybe it is the thrill of the gamble. Maybe it is the camaraderie of suffering. Or maybe it is because no matter how bad it gets, there is always someone who whispers, “It can’t be that bad.”

We were thinking of hanging the TV on the very narrow wall to the right of the fireplace or maybe it would be better above the bar cart?

For decor so far, I think we have a few earthy colored pieces. Some things we thought of changing:
- matching blankets/throws for couch
- more wall decor (pls I beg you for suggestions) 
- a rug for the dining table
- adding coffee table and dining table decor
- curtains for the sliding doors? I don’t want to take off the blind system completely, so was thinking of clipping the curtains on where the slats would be.

He gets MUCH more worse after he got banished to Hell, which was deserves due to how much of a war-monger he is, ruling it with an iron fist, abusing the hell-born demons constantly, even if some of them fought alongside him during the war, and torturing sinners, even though SOME of them deserve it, it’s still too cruel.

Even though he SEEMS to care about some people, like his closest and best friend Dana, it’s likely that they are only purely pragmatic, as he sees them as a means to an end, with even DANA, his oldest friend, wanting to overthrow her as she sees that Satan has gone too far, and wants to put herself on the throne to make things be better, showing that even his *best friend* is starting to hate him.

This gets especially worse with his kids, with the two staying with him, Evil Eye and Strawberry Milkshake, being constantly berated and abused by their father for their repeated failures, literally *putting one up for adoption* (Black Coffee Mug) just because he felt that he was ""too uninteresting"", and don’t get me started on Coffee Mug… Long story short, if he says that he ""loves"" Coffee Mug, despite ""all the pain he put her throug"", it’s like saying if Darth Sidious loves Rey Palpatine.

I believe I made a major mistake today. I got a coffee drink from a coffee shop that contained vanilla extract, which has some alcohol content. I searched up the ingredients online for the drink and found that in the company’s ingredients, it did not specifically list vanilla extract so I thought it was safe. While I was drinking it, I did some more digging and I found out that one of the ingredients in the ingredients contained vanilla extract, which has some alcohol content. I automatically stopped drinking the drink and threw it out. I know some people say that vanilla extract is not haram because it doesn’t intoxicate but ever since I knew that it contained some alcohol, I avoided it just to be safe. Are my prayers not going to be accepted for 40 days because I had a suspicion that it had alcohol but I drank it anyway after finding that the ingredients did not show vanilla extract but still having a bit of suspicion that I did more research and found out that it did have vanilla extract? I did make repentance and I sincerely regret it but I’m still panicking a bit.

I lost my dad, then my wife, and honestly, I lost myself too. So, I took some time off and went back to Thailand for four months. I'd lived there before, even planned on moving back eventually. One night, I ended up in one of those girly bars in the tourist area. I met her there. We just clicked. I was lonely, I'll admit it, and we ended up spending the night together. It started like that, transactional. But then it kept happening, only the money stopped. She'd just stay with me, or leave the bar early to hang out. We actually started to connect, emotionally. She invited me to her family's place. It was amazing. They welcomed me like I was one of them. We fell for each other, hard. Talked about the future, kids, everything. It felt so real.

Then my trip ended, and the reality of her life crashed down on us. She hated the bar, called it dirty, but felt like she had no choice. No education, family to support. I understood, but the thought of her going back just killed me. I asked her what she'd do if she had another option, and she mentioned wanting a little coffee shop back home. The startup costs were surprisingly low, less than a thousand bucks. I was desperate, I guess, and maybe a little in love, so I helped her get it started before I left.

Back home, we were constantly video chatting. The coffee shop seemed to be doing okay, enough to get by. Then, a month later, she tells me she's going on a trip with friends. I was immediately uneasy. She’d barely started the business, and it felt like she couldn't afford a trip. But she got defensive, so I let it go. She said she was meeting two friends, one still working in a bar, the other a former bar girl whose boyfriend is Taiwanese and runs those ""karaoke"" bars – you know, the ones that are basically fronts for prostitution.

Two weeks of pure hell later, I found out the truth. She wasn't with friends. She was in Taiwan, working in one of those karaoke bars. I felt sick to my stomach. She was so apologetic, said the coffee shop wasn't making enough, that she lied because she didn't want to burden me, didn't want to lose me.

Then she told me about what it was actually like there. Five, six men a day. The way she talked about it, the disgust, the self-loathing… it just broke me. She called herself bad, dirty. It was awful. I know where she comes from, the poverty, the desperation. I’m just so angry at the people who took advantage of her.

Now she’s back home, but I know it’s only a matter of time before she has to go back. I’m consumed by it. I can’t work, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. I know people will judge me, judge *her*, but I can’t help how I feel. I see *her*, not just what she’s been through. I’m lost, helpless, and just so incredibly sad. What am I supposed to do?

1inanbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1inanbc/sleep_advice_tips/,Sleep Advice Tips,"

Hi All - I (43M) have enlisted the help of a pretty awesome coach this year, as I am planning on breaking 2:50 before the year is out (and before I get too old). I have done a few marathons in the high 2:5X range, but pretty much all just from doing my own thing (ie relatively minimal plan/structure or really anything “advanced” about my running - either before or during), and all on more challenging courses (most recently Boston last year) whereas this year I’ll be doing Chicago plus another flat/local marathon this spring. So overall - with the flat courses, plan she has put together, using super shoes for first time, proper nutrition (what I found out is basically I have been doing the opposite of the “right” way for years), etc, I am pretty confident I can get this done. Right now I feel in the best shape of my life. 

The one piece that I struggle with is sleep. She insists on a minimum of 7 plus an hour for every hour of exercise done that day. And I see tons of posts/recommendations on here about it too. And of course the influencers on instagram wont shut up about it (I feel like sleep has overtaken “run eassssy” as the ‘duh’ piece of advice that’s seemingly on repeat from this crew)

So obviously I get it - makes tons of both common and scientific sense. I guess my issue is it’s easier said than done. Like many of you I’m sure, I have lots of other things to balance in my life - including an intense job, plus a wife and two young boys who I love spending time with! Sleeping solidly from 9pm to 7am with a slice of cucumber over each eye - yeah that ain’t happening. And even for people without those added factors to consider, I am sure just getting into bed and getting a solid 9 hours isn’t always easy. 

So what reliable advice/tips do you all have? For context some things I am already doing/experiencing:

1. I don’t drink alcohol
2. I try and drink some sort of hot (but not caffeinated) drink in the lead up to bed time 
3. I read (on a kindle) in bed
4. I have 1-2 strong cups of coffee each day, but never after 9am
5. I am guilty of eating fairly close to bed time (usually Greek yogurt with honey) if that is problematic for sleep? My diet is good/balanced though. 
6. I have tried melatonin but don’t notice any really improvement. Same with deep breathing techniques. 
7. Going to sleep is a piece of cake. It’s staying asleep that’s the issue. Usually wake up middle of the night and it takes a couple hours to fall back asleep 
8. Due to said stressful job and to ensure I get good family time at weekends, a lot of my running is done very early in the morning - so typically I am targeting 9pm-5am to sleep


Would love to hear your tips/tricks/advice. I think the only thing I am not open to (because like many of you, I want to be less, not more, reliant on phone/apps + I hate wearing headphones in bed) is I am not really interested in things like Calm or other sleep/meditation apps.

We deal with heavy material here, lives in the balance, but I was hoping that we could take a lighter look on the family dynamic for a minute.  I am a couple of months ahead of the date, but could use y'all's advice. 

FATHER'S DAY. 

So. My MIL doesn't work.  Really only held a job for one year of her miserable life.  My FIL, a saint of a man, has fully and completely given this awful women every single thing in her life.  He works a full-time job that requires overtime and picks up side jobs to help meet every damn whim of this hateful woman. 

She doesn't cook. She doesn't clean, she doesn't work, she doesn't do laundry, she doesn't even get her nasty ass up, out of the 15th recliner, to go to the bathroom.  She sits right there, no panties, with her dress hiked up around her hips, & pisses on a potty pad, so that she doesn't have to walk her lazy ass 10' to the bathroom. 

She is so vile that she won't even allow the abused dogs she owns WATER during the day because that means she would have to get up to let them outside, or she would have to get up to pick up their potty pads off the floor.  VILE. 

Her only activity is chain smoking with one hand & puffing on a nebulizer with the other.  But I digress... I HATE her. 

Back to FIL... so every dime that comes into his hands HAS to be spent on her.  If it is not, *like God forbid he have to go to the doctor & spends $20 on a co-pay*, there is hell to pay. 

With Father's Day coming up, I want to give my FIL a gift that she can't get part of. My budget is up to $200. 

I can't give a gift card to any place because she will get it. 

If the gift card is to a *""man's store""*, she will take it & give/sell it to someone else. 

I gave him tools one year. She took the set & gave it to my BIL. 🤬  

He doesn't drink alcohol or coffee.  We have given him grill kits. 

He doesn't have a hobby outside of his ratchet wife. And if we offer him a fishing trip or night at casino...the evil bish throws a fit.  She has even screamed, red faced & stomping feet, that we *""don't know how spiteful & hateful""* (her words) she can be. 

He has a sweet tooth but I refuse to gift him any foodstuff because I don't want her to benefit in anyway...not even a piece of candy. 

He doesn't wear cologne.  Any clothing item given to him will either be grabbed up so she can regift it or it will disappear with her explanation of, *""He's got too many clothes & I was getting rid of 💩.""*

I would buy him shoes/boots but I don't know his size, asking her is not an option & if they are name brand, she will regift them. 

Any gift of money winds up in her hands...and I refuse!!! 

So, my fellow denizen of MILs from hell, give me your ideas. 

*Yes, we have offered to pay for a divorce.  My husband even offered to fix him up with someone else because he,  obviously, inherited his mother's scheming ways. No dice.* 

And THANK YOU in advance.

I lost my dad, then my wife, and honestly, I lost myself too. So, I took some time off and went back to Thailand for four months. I'd lived there before, even planned on moving back eventually. One night, I ended up in one of those girly bars in the tourist area. I met her there. We just clicked. I was lonely, I'll admit it, and we ended up spending the night together. It started like that, transactional. But then it kept happening, only the money stopped. She'd just stay with me, or leave the bar early to hang out. We actually started to connect, emotionally. She invited me to her family's place. It was amazing. They welcomed me like I was one of them. We fell for each other, hard. Talked about the future, kids, everything. It felt so real.

Then my trip ended, and the reality of her life crashed down on us. She hated the bar, called it dirty, but felt like she had no choice. No education, family to support. I understood, but the thought of her going back just killed me. I asked her what she'd do if she had another option, and she mentioned wanting a little coffee shop back home. The startup costs were surprisingly low, less than a thousand bucks. I was desperate, I guess, and maybe a little in love, so I helped her get it started before I left.

Back home, we were constantly video chatting. The coffee shop seemed to be doing okay, enough to get by. Then, a month later, she tells me she's going on a trip with friends. I was immediately uneasy. She’d barely started the business, and it felt like she couldn't afford a trip. But she got defensive, so I let it go. She said she was meeting two friends, one still working in a bar, the other a former bar girl whose boyfriend is Taiwanese and runs those ""karaoke"" bars – you know, the ones that are basically fronts for prostitution.

Two weeks of pure hell later, I found out the truth. She wasn't with friends. She was in Taiwan, working in one of those karaoke bars. I felt sick to my stomach. She was so apologetic, said the coffee shop wasn't making enough, that she lied because she didn't want to burden me, didn't want to lose me.

Always was hard to wake up, always was tired after sleep. My sleep was always very deep, that deep that i was waking up only after second or third alarm on phone. 
After a really mentally hard day ( day 7 ), today i woke up after 6 hours of sleep, and i felt amazing. Not tired, slept enough, and felt great. Day was okay, but still, i had some anxiety/stress or feeling depressed moments, which occured like 4-5 times during the day. Also, one happened 30min ago, like i felt big pressure on my chest, and maximum anxiety together with the stress. Idk, is it called panic attack? After deep breaths, it disappeared. 

Still, to this day, i never really wanted to smoke. I didnt wanted to get nicotine, all i really wanted is just to have this process, of smoking the cig. My brain like remembers how great it was, not the smell or taste, but just the process of inhaling, smoking. The day wasnt hard, was easy, lets see what is coming tomorrow. Still now, it kinda feels that i miss something, that i forget to smoke in the morning with coffee, or before sleep, or during the day, or when i drive, always want to do it. Idk how to explain, but it feels that my brain is really missing it, like its part of me, part of my day, my hobby, its me. Yesterday was the hardest day i would say, i hope the sun will finally shine on my side.

Btw., also very strange thing, when i was smoking, i constantly felt that something is wrong with my health, i just felt it, like paranoia. I literally like knew that im not healthy, that something is wrong that i have cancer and stuff like that. Now i dont feel anything. I 100% sure that already now i have much more energy than before.

Ever notice how some days just feel like dragging a boulder up a hill? Yeah, me too. 😅 But let's flip the script today and talk about something totally game-changing: celebrating **daily wins**. Imagine high-fiving your way through life by savoring those little victories. Who's with me?

**Why Bother with the Small Stuff? 🤔**

* Let’s face it: life isn’t always about giant leaps. More often, it’s about tiny, stealthy steps. Kind of like when you realize you put your keys in the *right* place for once!
* These mini-victories boost our mood and keep us motivated. Because, seriously, who doesn’t need a sprinkle of joy here and there?
* Building a habit of acknowledging our little wins encourages a positivity snowball effect. Picture it: a happier you, just from noticing the good things!

**How to Spot and Celebrate These Wins: 🎉**

1. **The “Got Out of Bed” Medal:** Some mornings, just getting up is a win. Award yourself that imaginary gold star!
2. **Master of Multitasking:** Managed to drink coffee and read an email without spilling? *That* deserves a moment of applause.
3. **Creative Problem Solver:** Fixing a Wi-Fi issue on your own? Have some cake. You deserve it.
4. **Personal Peace Treaty:** Kept your cool in a crowded grocery store? Nobel Peace Prize, anyone?
    
**Making it Stick:**

- **Gratitude Journals:** Jot down your daily victories every night. Even if it’s, “Found matching socks!” 
- **Share the Good Vibes:** Tell a friend or post them here! We want to celebrate with you. 🎈
- **Reflect Back:** At the end of the week, think about how these itty-bitty wins made your life just a tad brighter.

Life is a series of moments; let’s make those moments count. Sure, achieving big dreams is amazing, but realizing you’ve walked 10,000 steps by just pacing around your house? Priceless. 🏅

So, what’s your daily win today? I spotted mine when I decided caffeine counts as hydration. Cheers to us! 🥤

Going for 2nd next time.,"I’m (36m) pretty recently single within the past few months. Have gone on a few dates and tried different methods for each one. 

The first person I talked to i disclosed before we even met, over text message and that was a mistake for sure. She said she wanted to still talk but of course the conversation eventually died off. 

The next was a hookup that I had zero interest in being with romantically. I told her right before we had sex and she was okay with it. 

The next person was an actual date. We had a really fun first date and at the very end, I disclosed to her and told her “think about it and let me know”. She was super sweet and said she didn’t need to think about it and wanted to pursue the relationship anyway. Unfortunately there was a lack of sexual chemistry and physical attraction and so I decided to cut things off which she was also fine with. 

The newest one was from just yesterday and I regret telling her on the first date. This was a really fast moving relationship which was nice instead of the never ending penpal game. We started chatting on Sunday afternoon and spent a couple hours talking on the phone Sunday evening. At the end of the call, I was really on the fence about her in general. It didn’t seem we had a lot in common so I was going to let things lie there. The next day (yesterday) she hit me up in the morning and asked if we could do coffee/tea at 5pm. I figured I had the day free and maybe it would be worth it to at least get to know her in person. Never in my life had someone grown on me in the span of a few hours like she did. We started out with tea, then we drove to get dinner somewhere else and on the way back to her car she asked me at least 3 times when we could see each other again. It felt really great…
Then we had the talk in the car. Same spiel as the last girl but I could see she was definitely not as receptive. I answered the questions she asked and told her the same thing; think about it and let me know. When she got home, she sent me this long message saying how much she liked me and how she wants to keep pursuing the relationship and then NOTHING. Didn’t reply to any messages last night and has ignored my 2 messages today as well. I figure she slept on it, changed her mind and decided to ghost me. It sucks really bad. 

So sorry for the long story but I always felt like 2 dates seems to be leading someone on. Like wasting their time if they’re not accepting of my condition but I’m done doing it on the first date. Hsv2 is not my identity and it doesn’t make me who I am as a person. I want the next person to get to know ME, not my mildly annoying skin condition.",4,1739310342.0,Herpes,3,1.0,False

Last year seed oil pressed out and cleared right up but this year's oil seems cloudy. I maybe filtered twice and warmed more on last year's seed. I also didn't wash the seeds. This year I washed them in running water but put them in the dehydrator for several hours after, very dry to touch. After pressing and letting sit several days i filtered once with coffee filters.

I'm thinking I either need to filter this years oil again or I need to heat it to drive out moisture. Anyone know what's up and how best to fix it? The leftmost jar is last year's. The center is this year's filtered once through coffee filters. The right hand jar was the same as the center but I put it in a warm oven overnight ~160F and turned off before I put it in.

Thought nothing much about it only there was some weird feeling around it which gave me chills in that moment and hoped to see her again soon at work to get each other to know better, she would be good company i knew.

Ofcourse no sight of her in months… it was the last time.



So since 2 weeks im following training in a classroom for some license.
And guess what; who I see there in this onusual location.

I walked up to her and said heey, what the heck are you doing here? She was here for the same thing but from another company.

Ever since, we are sitting next to eachother, smoking cigs and drinking coffee together, saying goodbye at our cars and in general we find eachother somehow every time.

But what now? Are those sings?
As you can imagine we are not in a private setting and coming from me, im not feeding too much since we are in this setting with random people around, so all along also from her its pretty casual, which is not a bad things since we are here for different things after all. 
But it make it kinda hard to validate her signs.

I feel really comfy with her around and honesty dont know what to do, id rather play it safe and dont want to fuck up something potiential good by asking her on a date where im maybe delusional by feeling this attraction and be left with nothing “again”.

Any Non-Medical Advice?,"My manic episodes used to last for 1.5 months. My depressive episodes used to last for ~3 months. With olanzapine, I’m only having hypomanic episodes which last for 2-3 weeks. And with fluoxetine, I’m only having depressive episodes which last for 2-3 weeks. 

Sounds like a huge improvement. The problem is that my euthymic moods are also only lasting for 2-3 weeks. 

I’m hypomanic for 2-3 weeks, euthymic for 2-3 weeks, depressed for 2-3 weeks, euthymic again for 2-3 weeks, then hypomanic again for 2-3 weeks. Rinse and repeat. 

The problem is that my cognitive abilities have taken a massive hit. My brain is completely scrambled, for example, I forgot what age I was. I had to ask my mother. I knew that I was in my 20’s, but couldn’t actually remember the exact age. 

I keep asking the same questions over and over again to the point that it irritates my family. I keep misplacing my medication, much to the frustration of my mother- who has to find it for me. I can’t retain new information. The list goes on. 

If I didn’t know any better, I would think that I had developed dementia. 

I’m seeing my psychiatrist soon. They’ll determine what to do in terms of medication. 

However, I’d like to hear what your advice is for rapid cycling. I’m going to completely eliminate alcohol and caffeine from my diet and see what, if any, difference it makes. Tomorrow will be my first day without my morning coffee. 

I’m also taking pretty strong vitamins (not prescribed). I’m wondering about omitting them too, but I’m not sold that the vitamins could be a contributing factor. 

I’m on a repeat prescription for PRN diazepam. I will try my best not to use it. I was also prescribed a short course of zolpidem to help with sleep. I’ll also try not to take any sleeping aids. 

Basically, I’m trying to strip back as many substances as I can, so that I can (more accurately) gauge what exactly is causing this rapid cycling. 

Does anyone else have any additional advice? ",1,1739310270.0,bipolar1,0,1.0,False

They walk toward the dorms. Brayden chats about classes, parties, and girls. Tariq listens, offering nothing back.  

---

### **SCENE 2 — INT. DORM ROOM — DAY**

A small, clean room with two beds. Tariq unpacks methodically. He pulls out a photo of his family—Ghost, Tasha, Raina. His jaw tightens before he shoves it into a drawer.  

**BRAYDEN:**  
You party? There’s one tonight. Good way to meet people.  

**TARIQ:**  
Nah, I’m good.  

Brayden shrugs, unfazed.  

**BRAYDEN:**  
Suit yourself. College ain’t just books, bro.  

---

### **SCENE 3 — INT. LECTURE HALL — DAY**

A large lecture hall. **PROFESSOR JABARI REYNOLDS** passionately lectures on power dynamics.  

**JABARI:**  
""Power doesn’t corrupt. It reveals.” What do you think that means?  

**LAUREN BALDWIN (19)**, sharp and confident, raises her hand.  

**LAUREN:**  
It means power shows who you really are. Without it, people hide. With it, they can't.  

Tariq watches her, intrigued. He scribbles in his notebook: *“Power exposes, not corrupts.”*

## **ACT 2: CONNECTIONS**

### **SCENE 4 — INT. CAMPUS QUAD — EVENING**

Brayden finds Tariq reading alone.  

**BRAYDEN:**  
Alright, man. I’m not taking no for an answer. You’re coming to the party.  

Tariq smirks.  

**TARIQ:**  
Persistent, huh?  

**BRAYDEN:**  
It’s a gift. Let’s go.  

---

### **SCENE 5 — INT. HOUSE PARTY — NIGHT**

Loud music, red cups, flashing lights. Tariq stays on the fringes, observing. Brayden is in his element—drinking, dancing, wild.  

Brayden flirts with a girl, **SOPHIE**, clearly someone else’s girlfriend. Her boyfriend, **CHASE**, a cocky frat boy, confronts him.  

**CHASE:**  
Yo, you touching my girl?  

**BRAYDEN (laughing):**  
Relax, bro. She’s the one all over me.  

Chase punches Brayden hard.  

### **FIGHT SCENE 1:**  
Tariq steps in, throwing an awkward punch—his lack of fighting experience is obvious. He gets overpowered quickly, taking a hard hit to the face.  

They’re dragged out of the party, bruised and breathless.  

**BRAYDEN (laughing through the pain):**  
Yo, you got hands like a T-Rex. Short and useless.  

Tariq can’t help but chuckle, despite the blood on his lip.

---

### **SCENE 6 — EXT. CAMPUS BENCH — LATER THAT NIGHT**

Tariq sits alone, nursing his bruises. **Lauren** approaches.  

**LAUREN:**  
Rough night?  

**TARIQ:**  
Something like that.  

They talk—about life, ambition, family. There’s an undeniable connection.  

---

## **ACT 3: THE GAME BEGINS**

### **SCENE 7 — INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM — DAY**

Tariq visits Tasha.  

**TASHA:**  
You staying out of trouble?  

**TARIQ:**  
Define ""trouble.""  

Tasha looks at him, worried.  

**TASHA:**  
Don’t be like him.  

Tariq’s jaw clenches.  

**TARIQ:**  
I’m not.  

---

### **SCENE 8 — INT. MONET TEJADA'S HOUSE — NIGHT**

**MONET (40s)** commands the room with quiet authority. **CANE (20s)** is all aggression, **DIANA (19)** observant.  

Monet discusses the need for someone smart to handle business at Stansfield.  

**DIANA:**  
I know someone. Tariq St. Patrick.  

Monet’s interest is piqued.  

---

### **SCENE 9 — INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE — NIGHT**

Tariq meets Monet. The tension is thick.  

**MONET:**  
You’re Ghost’s son. Thought you’d be taller.  

**TARIQ:**  
I’m not here to be him. I’m here to make money.  

Monet studies him, then smirks.  

**MONET:**  
We’ll see.  

---

## **ACT 4: CONSEQUENCES**

### **SCENE 10 — INT. PRISON — NIGHT**

Tasha faces off with another inmate. A brutal, gritty fight ensues. Tasha wins but looks shaken.  

---

### **SCENE 11 — EXT. CITY ALLEY — NIGHT**

A drug deal with Monet’s crew goes sideways. Guns are pulled.  

### **SHOOTING SCENE:**  
Tariq freezes when things go south. **Cane** shoots a rival without hesitation. Blood splatters on Tariq’s face.  

His expression? Fear and realization. This isn’t just business—it’s life or death.  

---

## **ACT 5: THE FALLOUT**

### **SCENE 12 — INT. LAUREN’S DORM — NIGHT**

Tariq shows up at Lauren’s door, vulnerable. They kiss, a mix of desire and escape from the chaos of their lives.  

---

### **SCENE 13 — INT. TARIQ'S DORM — NIGHT**

Tariq receives a text:  
*“Meet me alone. No Brayden. No Monet.”*  

He steps into the darkness of the city, phone in hand.

Ever find yourself in that dreaded ""meh"" zone where everything feels just a little… dull? 😬 You're cruising through your daily routine, but joy seems to be on a permanent vacation? Yeah, I've been there too. But guess what? Injecting a bit of joy into your day doesn't have to be rocket science (thank goodness, right?). Here are **5 super simple ways to sprinkle more joy into your daily grind**. Ready? Let’s dive in!

**1. Dance Like Nobody’s Watching (Literally, Nobody's Watching)**
Imagine busting a move in your kitchen to your favorite jam. Feels like something out of a feel-good movie, doesn’t it? 🎶 Whether it’s a full-on 80s dance-off or just a gentle sway to some chill tunes, moving to your favorite music can be a joyful escape. *Bonus: you get a mini workout without even realizing it!*

**2. Morning Gratitude: A Simple Thank You Note to Yourself**
Every morning, write down one thing you’re grateful for. It doesn’t have to be monumental – maybe it's just that perfect cup of coffee or the fact that you remembered to water your plants. ☕️🌿 This tiny practice can set a positive tone for the day and it’s seriously underrated.

**3. The Art of Saying ""No""**
Sounds weird, I know. But think about it: how many times have you agreed to something only to regret it later? Saying ""no"" to things that don’t serve you opens up space for what truly brings you joy. More free time = more opportunities for doing what you love. 🎨📚

**4. Connect with Your Inner Child**
Remember when everything was fun and exciting? Try bringing a slice of that back. Build a fort with your kids, doodle on a napkin while on hold, or just go outside and relive your love for swings. 🌈 It's not just for the kiddos—it's amazing how it can uplift your mood.

**5. Random Acts of Kindness**
Why not make someone else's day? It could be as simple as complimenting a stranger or leaving a note of appreciation for your co-worker. 🌼 Kindness is infectious, and you'll find that the happiness you bring others tends to boomerang right back to you.

So there you have it, friends! Just a few small shifts to introduce a little extra joy into every day. Who knew that something as simple as a playlist or a heartfelt ""no"" could add so much sparkle to your routine? ✨

How do you sprinkle joy into your daily life? Ever tried any of these little hacks and noticed a difference? 🤔 Let's keep the conversation rolling in our next scroll through the comments. Until then, keep shining, MaximizeMe crew! 🌟",1,1739310223.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1inaau9,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1inaau9/youre_doing_great/,You're doing great 🫶,"I'm very much in the throws of postpartum life with a 4 week old. It's been such an adventure. Filled with long sleepless nights where I'm up to my elbows in various bodily fluids from breast milk leaking everywhere to yellow baby poop staining everything. Days where not even coffee keeps me going. Dealing with mastitis, clogged ducts and clothes wet with milk, I smell like spoiled milk all the time. I can't even take a shower without immediately soiling myself with milk again. My meals are rarely warm, I eat quickly because my baby wants to eat when I'm eating. I'm scavenging my pantry when I can just to get some energy. How much water have I had today? Did I take my prenatal? Is my baby doing ok? Am I a good parent? 

I'm here to tell you, if you relate to the first paragraph and are struggling, it's ok. It gets easier. I promise you it does. I'm a mom of 2 so this is not my first rodeo. If you're in the transition from 0 kids to 1 kid you're in the hardest part and you're doing great. I can guarantee you any child you have after your first is a breeze compared to having your first baby. The first baby teaches you how to be a parent without a manual, it's strictly trial by error in the absolute worst conditions. You're healing, learning, not getting enough sleep/food all while trying to keep a tiny little human alive. Be kind to yourself and your partner, neither of you have done this before. You're all learning together. 

In all of this I am thriving, yes thriving. Let go of any control you think you have. Just live life like you don't know what's going to happen next. Baby is not sleeping? They're not giving you a hard time, they're having a hard time. Overstimulated from the wetness of leaking milk everywhere? That's temporary, it will go away or at least slow down once your supply regulates. Change your clothes when you can and be prepared to do it again when you inevitably leak again. Having baby blues, PPD/PPA? It's okay to ask for help, it's not embarrassing. It's ok. Breathe. Only you can decide what breaks you. I really struggled with postpartum depression and anxiety with my first and I wish someone would have told me that when I was going through it. The fogginess goes away, the anxiety goes away, the depression cannot hold you down forever. Don't give in. Wherever you are, whatever season of life you're in, you're doing great.

I have an oracle jet because my wife sometimes makes coffee at home occasionally too and they want ease of use.

I am getting very frustrated with the inconsistencies from shot to shot. The first shot always runs much faster than the second despite running blank shots to bring the portafilter up to temperature. I attribute this to retention/exchange retention with the built in grinder.

I want to improve the consistency and also have the option to switch between beans.

I am considering either getting a single dose hopper with bellows for the oracle from etsy. Or buying a DF54 which i will use while my wife will still use the standard hopper on the jet.

They’re a sniper’s dream, a tight, high-intent audience that converts like crazy if you know how to dominate.

Most SEOs waltz in with their usual keyword strategies, throw up some content and wonder why they’re getting outperformed by a homemade blog. 

***The rules are different.***

🔎 Find ultra-targeted long-tail keywords that drive revenue

🕵️ Find hidden competitors in micro-markets

🛠 Non-traditional link-building to build authority

📈 Social engineering to dominate where Google isn't looking

# Step 1: Advanced Keyword Research for Niche Markets

Think long-tail keywords are enough? Cute. The game is bigger than that. You need layered intent, predictive analysis, and a ruthless focus on user behavior.

# The ""Layered Intent"" Keyword Strategy

Instead of just finding long-tail keywords, you must layer them by intent:

* **Informational:** ""How to choose the best hiking gear for beginners""
* **Commercial:** ""Best hiking gear for budget travelers""
* **Transactional:** ""Buy lightweight hiking gear online""

# How to Find These Keywords in Semrush

1. Use the [Keyword Magic Tool](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/keywordmagic/start) to filter by search intent and isolate low-competition gems.
2. Analyze Keyword Trends to find rising niche search terms before they become competitive.
3. Spy on Amazon to discover product driven queries (Google doesn’t always prioritize e-commerce intent).

https://preview.redd.it/1c58gb5rwkie1.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc0058717c4ec9a295d28ee7ea418a3c20c235bd

Many niche markets don’t use Google as their primary search tool, Reddit, Discord, and niche forums drive intent heavy searches. Use Semrush’s Social Media Tracker to identify discussion based keywords.

# Step 2: Competitor Intelligence in Low-Competition SERPs

SEO tools keep feeding you the same tired ""competitors"", but let’s be real, your actual threats are lurking in subreddits, Discord servers, and tiny blogs that Google doesn’t even know exist.

# Find True Niche Competitors with Semrush

1. Use the Organic Research Tool to extract low-traffic but high-authority competitors.
2. Run Market Explorer and filter for micro-competitors who dominate a specific niche.
3. Analyze Backlink Profiles, many niche competitors don't rank highly but have strong authority via partnerships, podcasts, and dark social presence.

https://preview.redd.it/abgvugthwkie1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=46e8a325a4af08f7e4511ce0c55e1ff09fe73687

If you’re targeting ""artisan coffee beans,"" your real competitors might be Reddit influencers, micro e-commerce brands, or direct importers, not Starbucks.

# Step 3: The Link Magnifier Strategy

Tried the same old link-building strategies? Yeah, good luck with that. Nobody in niche markets is handing out backlinks. You gotta be smarter.

1. Mainstream sites ignore niche topics.
2. Niche sites lack established backlink networks.

# The ""Link Magnifier"" Approach

* **Find niche community backlinks** **-** Many niche brands get powerful links from forums, micro-blogs, and industry specific resources.
* **Monitor unlinked brand mentions -** Use [Semrush’s Brand Monitoring Tool](https://www.semrush.com/apps/brand-monitoring/) to track potential link reclamation opportunities.
* **Use HOAR (**[Help Out A Reporter](https://hoar.pr)**) for hyper-specific expert quotes -** Niche publications love quoting specialists over generalists.

https://preview.redd.it/uelh9ue0ukie1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca2d7fe75706196195a34d8d9c4383a9d85e6cce

A custom mechanical keyboard company should focus on hobbyist blogs, enthusiast YouTube channels, and Discord communities rather than mainstream tech news.

# Step 4: Social Engineering & SERP Hijacking

You think all the action happens on Google? Rookie move. Your buyers are making their decisions in social channels, Reddit, Discord, private Facebook groups. Get in or get left behind.

https://preview.redd.it/sly2ot0stkie1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=216d853e68c07545a0e38ce013c8fac3a9c4d964

# How to Hijack Social

* Use Semrush’s Social Media Tracker to monitor Reddit & Discord trends.
* Drop “non-promotional” comments in niche subreddits and forums, linking to valuable resources.
* Deploy Quora Answer Seeding, build credibility as an expert, then funnel organic traffic.

Instead of ranking for ""best cycling shoes,"" infiltrate r/cycling by answering ""Why do my cycling shoes hurt after long rides?"" with a genuinely helpful response that subtly links to your store.

# Step 5: AI Search Optimization for Niche Markets

Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) is killing traditional organic rankings by prioritizing AI-driven answers. The only way to win? Force AI to cite your content.

# AI Search Domination Strategy

1. Optimize for Zero-Click Queries - Structure content in direct-answer formats (lists, tables, schema markup).
2. Use Structured Data for Authority Signals - Make your brand is “sourceable” for AI-driven SERP features.
3. Monitor AI Overviews - Track if Google’s AI is pulling your content and optimize for higher relevancy.

A vegan skincare brand should optimize for questions AI is likely to answer, like ""Best vegan moisturizer for dry skin?"" instead of just ""vegan skincare products.""

# Step 6: Authority Hacking for Long-Term SERP Control

Niche brands struggle to build authority because they don’t have mainstream recognition. 

Your move? Create your own ecosystem.

# 🏆 Brand Search Engineering for Niche SEO

* **Hijack Branded Search Trends -** Encourage people to Google your brand with strategic PR and content marketing.
* **Control Third-Party Mentions -** Use guest posting, podcast features, and influencer collaborations to build external credibility.
* **Optimize for Branded SERPs -** Your site dominates all search variations of your brand name + primary keyword.

A boutique tea brand should aim for ""Why \[Brand\] is better than Lipton"" rankings instead of just ""best organic tea.""

1ina45a,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ina45a/the_second_chance/,"""The Second Chance""","The rain fell in sheets, blurring the neon lights of the city into a kaleidoscope of colors. I stood under the awning of a convenience store, staring at the crumpled piece of paper in my hand. It was a job rejection letter—the fifth one this month. My savings were nearly gone, and the weight of failure pressed down on me like the storm clouds above.

I had always been a dreamer. Growing up, I believed I could change the world, or at least my little corner of it. But life had other plans. A series of bad decisions, missed opportunities, and a heartbreak that left me hollow had brought me to this moment—standing in the rain, wondering if I’d ever find my way back.

As I shoved the letter into my pocket, I noticed a figure huddled in the alley across the street. It was an old man, his clothes soaked, his face hidden beneath a tattered hood. Something about him made me pause. Maybe it was the way he shivered, or the way he clutched a small, worn bag to his chest. Or maybe it was the fact that, for the first time in months, I felt a flicker of something other than self-pity.

I crossed the street, my shoes sloshing through puddles. When I reached him, I crouched down and asked if he was okay. He looked up, his eyes tired but kind, and shook his head. “Just trying to stay dry,” he muttered.

I didn’t have much to give, but I bought him a hot coffee and a sandwich from the convenience store. As I handed them to him, he smiled—a small, grateful smile that made my chest ache. We sat there in silence for a while, the rain tapping out a rhythm on the pavement.

“You’re a good kid,” he said finally, his voice rough but warm. “Not many people stop to help an old man like me.”

I shrugged, unsure of what to say. “I just… I know what it’s like to feel invisible.”

He studied me for a moment, then reached into his bag and pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook. The cover was worn, the edges frayed, but it looked like it had been well-loved. He handed it to me.

“What’s this?” I asked.

“A second chance,” he said simply. “I used to write in that notebook. Stories, mostly. About people I met, places I’ve been. It kept me going when things got tough. Maybe it’ll do the same for you.”

I opened the notebook and flipped through the pages. They were filled with handwritten notes, sketches, and fragments of stories. It was messy and beautiful, a testament to a life lived fully, even in its struggles.

“Why are you giving this to me?” I asked.

He smiled again, this time with a hint of sadness. “Because I can see it in your eyes. You’ve lost your way. But helping others—even in small ways—can remind you who you are. Maybe this’ll help you find your story again.”

I didn’t know what to say. Before I could thank him, he stood up, slung his bag over his shoulder, and walked away, disappearing into the rain.

That night, I sat in my tiny apartment and read through the notebook. Each page was a glimpse into someone else’s life—a struggling single mother, a runaway teenager, a war veteran trying to find peace. Their stories were raw and real, and they reminded me of something I’d forgotten: that everyone is fighting their own battles, and even the smallest act of kindness can make a difference.

I started writing again. At first, it was just scribbles in the margins of the notebook, but soon, the words began to flow. I wrote about the old man, about the people I’d met, and about my own struggles. And as I wrote, something inside me began to heal.

Months later, I found myself standing in front of a small crowd at a local café, reading one of my stories aloud. When I finished, there was silence—not the kind that feels heavy, but the kind that feels full. Then, someone started clapping, and soon the room was filled with applause.

Afterward, a woman approached me. She had tears in her eyes and told me that my story had reminded her of her own journey. “Thank you,” she said. “You have no idea how much I needed to hear that.”

As I walked home that night, I thought about the old man and the notebook he’d given me. He was right—helping others had given me a second chance. Not just to rebuild my life, but to rediscover the person I’d always wanted to be.

The rain had stopped, and the city glistened under the streetlights. For the first time in a long time, I felt hopeful. I didn’t know what the future held, but I knew one thing for certain: I was ready to keep writing my story.

Looking for friends, ideally in the UK, and if you live locally (Northwest), that would be even better, as it would be so nice to be able to meet up irl eventually. 

I’m fairly quiet and introverted to begin with, and kinda sensitive. I’m also outdoorsy, enjoy hiking, music and coffee, love animals and hold down a professional career. I identify as bi. 

I’ve struggled with social anxiety in the past but feel I’m well on my way to beating it. If you’re dealing with anxiety too, maybe we can be a source of support for each other, and if you’re looking for someone to go for walks or hikes with, or just coffee, then I’d especially love to hear from you!!

Curly insisted on riding in the ambulance with Alice, while Victor and I tailed behind it en route to the hospital.  The twins stayed behind to talk to the responding officers.  I don’t know how long we sat in the waiting room.  Well, I should say Victor and I sat.  Curly paced back and forth, gnawing at his fingernails, his eyes boring into the tile floor.

Victor fiddled with the head of his cane, and I replayed the events of the last several hours.  When the police had shown up after Andrew called them, they cordoned off the apartment and declared it an active crime scene.  However, I overheard one of them telling another that he hadn't found any fingerprints on anything besides those belongings to the victim.  It was bizarre.  There was simply no way one person could cut a hole in her own stomach and run cello strings through her own vocal cords before wiring them into her lower jaw.  It just wasn't possible.  She would have passed out way before finishing.

“Mr. Canton?”  All three of us looked up as a doctor approached, looking grim.  Curly stopped pacing.

“That's me,” he said.  The doctor approached and shook his hand.

“I'm Dr. Grant,” she said, by way of an introduction.  “You came in with Alice Beckett, correct?”

“Yeah, I did.  Please tell me she's gonna be okay,” Curly said, fidgeting his hands together.  Dr. Grant looked down at the floor for a moment.

“Good news is, she's going to live.  We were able to do a skin-muscle graft to repair her abdomen, as well as remove the strings without causing a hemorrhage.  The bad news…”  She shook her head.  “The damage to her vocal cords was extensive.  We did what we could, but there is a very high probability that she will be mute for the rest of her life.”  Curly breathed a sigh of relief.  Evidently he was willing to accept a silent Alice over no Alice at all.  Frankly, I agreed with him.

“So uh…when can I see her?” he asked.  

“Are you family?” asked Dr. Grant, narrowing her eyes.  

“No, no, I'm her uh–”  Curly cleared his throat.  “I'm a friend,” he said finally.  

“Alice's parents passed years ago,” Victor interrupted, standing.  “She has an aunt up in Montpelier; I'm sure the police will reach out to her soon.”  Dr. Grant folded her arms.

“Well…I suppose there's no harm in letting you sit with her, Mr. Canton.  She is still unconscious, mind you.” 

“That's all right, I'd like to…she oughta have someone be there when she wakes up.”  Dr. Grant nodded.

“Hey, Curly, do you want us to stick around?” I asked.  He shook his head, forcing a watery smile onto his face.  

“Nah, I'll manage.  You two can go on home if you want…I'll call ya if I need ya.”  We told him to pass on our well-wishes to Alice when she did wake up before heading home.

Victor spent the night in his studio again.

In fact, he spent the next few nights in his studio, not coming to bed until at least four or five in the morning, if he came to bed at all.  The few times I went to check on him, he was talking to himself, sometimes in Ukrainian, and I could only catch a few things here and there.  One phrase I managed to catch bothered me intensely:  “She must have more; she is starving.”  Who was ‘she’?  Victor didn’t really hang out with any other women besides me and occasionally my roommate when he came over to my place.  I wrote it down in one of my notebooks and filed it away for later.

In addition to his renewed nocturnal habits, I noticed something else; his limp was getting worse again.  Victor had never told me what was actually wrong with his leg; when I asked, all he would say was that it “just didn’t work right”.  I stopped asking after a while, since I could tell the subject was very touchy for him.  Whenever he did come to bed, I would get a hot water bottle for his hip and make sure the pillow under his knee was adjusted just right.  

One night, I’d finally managed to convince him to go to bed at around midnight, a total miracle on my part.  He’d never expressly forbidden me from going into his studio when he wasn’t there, it was just something I refrained from doing out of respect.  The only thing he’d asked was that I didn’t go around touching everything.  This time, however, I was too curious.  I needed to see what he was working on so fervently.

I padded down the hall and down the stairs leading to the studio, slowly pushing the door open to avoid it creaking.  The studio didn’t look anything out of the ordinary, a few clay models here and there and tools scattered in organized chaos on the workbenches.  But in the middle of the room I saw it: Victor’s latest masterpiece.  It was life-size, carved out of granite, and depicted a young man clawing at one of his legs, unnaturally sharp fingernails digging into the flesh and leaving deep, jagged trenches, almost as if he were trying to rip it off altogether.  I moved a little closer, peering up at it and shuddering at the expression of unadulterated rage and loathing on its face, when I suddenly realized I recognized it.  

It was Victor’s face.  I stumbled back, shaking my head in disbelief.  When I looked back up, all the features I loved were still there:  the sunken eyes, the untamable curls, the chiseled jaw…it was all him, but twisted into a mask of pure hatred.

“What are you doing down here?”  I spun around.  Victor stood on the steps, dressed in his working clothes.  

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered.  “I was just curious to see what you were working on.”  Victor ran a hand through his hair, hobbling down the steps and towards the statue, waving me aside.

“Wha–It’s not even finished yet, why would you want to see it like this?” he groused, picking up a hammer and chisel and chipping off a few stray chunks of jagged rock.  I stepped back, giving him room to work.

“Why does it look like you?” I asked.  He shrugged, not looking at me.

“It just does.”

“Vic, this isn’t healthy.  You’re going to work yourself to exhaustion, a-and is this how you see yourself?  Why do you hate yourself?”

“I don’t hate *myself,* I just hate this stupid thing,” he snapped, laying down the chisel for a moment to slap at his bad leg.  “It’s disgusting, it doesn’t work properly; I mean, who in their right mind wants to be around a cripple?”  

“Hey!  I’m standing right here, pal.”  I was about to go hug him when he picked up the chisel again, and I moved back a bit, not wanting rock shrapnel in my face.  “I don’t really care whether your leg works right or not; it’s not like I want to run marathons and expect you to go with me.  Why obsess over something you can’t really change?”  The hammer and chisel paused.  

“It’s not enough,” he said, hanging his head for a moment.  I wanted to say something, anything to comfort him, when I noticed a dark splotch appearing on his jeans, around his upper thigh.  Dark…and red.

“Victor,” I said softly, “Vitya…you’re bleeding.”  He looked down at his leg, shrugging once more.  

“It’s nothing,” he said, and would have gone on working had he not suddenly swayed, lost his balance, and crumpled to the floor at the feet of his own effigy.  I managed to catch him before he hit his head on the corner of the granite, and he let out a groan of pain.  With a great amount of effort, I hauled him back up the stairs and into the kitchen, leveraging him into a chair.  “What are you doing?” he mumbled, reaching out for me as I went to grab my phone.

“I’m calling an ambulance.”

“*Kokhanyy* (darling), you don’t need to, I’ll be fine.”  He tried to stand, but I pushed him back down.

“Uh-uh, you’re staying right where you are, Victor Levchenko.  You are bleeding profusely, and last I checked, blood is supposed to stay *inside* your body.”  He let out a short chuckle, resting his head on his hand.  

“Stubborn,” he teased.  

An ambulance soon arrived, and we wound up at the same hospital we’d accompanied Alice to just a few weeks prior.  I sat in the waiting room for a long time before someone came to speak to me.  It wasn’t the same doctor we’d talked to last time, but an older man with round glasses and a kind face who introduced himself as Dr. Finch.

“How is he?”

“Resting at the moment.  We had to sedate him for his own safety.  You'll be able to see him shortly, but I'd like to keep him for a couple of days for observation.”  I frowned.

“Why?  What was causing the bleeding?”  Dr. Finch took off his glasses and folded them, sticking them in his pocket.

“I think it's best if I just show you,” he said.  “If you'll follow me.”  Dr. Finch led me down the hall and into a room.  Victor lay in a hospital bed, asleep.  He was pale, his face gaunt and sickly.  I rubbed his arm for a moment before Dr. Finch cleared his throat.  “Miss Song, this is likely going to be disturbing for you,” he warned.

“I've seen worse.” 

“Very well.”  Dr. Finch cleared his throat again.  “Miss Song, do you know what a cilice is?”  I wrinkled my nose.

“Can't say I do, no.”  The doctor removed a white cloth from a metal tray, revealing what looked like a narrow panel of chainmail, over a foot long, with small spikes protruding from the rings.  Upon closer inspection, I saw that the spikes were covered in blood.  “Oh my God…”

“Do you know if Mr. Levchenko holds any particularly extreme religious beliefs?” Dr. Finch asked.  

“Not really.  Neither of us are very religious in the first place.”  Dr. Finch rubbed his chin.

“The cilice is a device used by a number of devout Catholics, mostly highly conservative sects like Opus Dei,” he explained.  “It’s meant to cause discomfort in the wearer in order to achieve penance for sins, similar to fasting.  Early models were made of animal hair.  Either way, they were not designed to cause severe pain or bleeding.  That's why I'd like to keep Mr. Levchenko for a couple of days.  This is concerning behavior that might suggest some psychological issues.”  I looked back over to Victor, so pale and fragile-looking now.

“He'll be all right, though…won't he?”  Dr. Finch patted my arm.

“Only time will tell.  But I will do my best.”  He smiled, trying to reassure me.  “You are welcome to stick around as long as you like; the hospital cafeteria is open if you're hungry.”  I was a little bit hungry.  Dr. Finch left to tend to other patients, and I sat with Victor until the rumbling in my stomach grew too loud to ignore.

It didn't take me long to find the hospital cafeteria, and with it, I found a familiar face.

“Curly?”  He looked up from his sandwich, smiling when he saw me.  There were dark circles under his eyes.

“Evenin’, Miss Livy,” he said, waving.  “How's things?”  I told him about Victor, and he sucked in a breath through his teeth, shaking his head.

“I'll be damned,” he said.  “Guess the whole thing with Sandra really got to all of us after a while.”

“How’s Alice?”

“Better than she was yesterday, which is the best I can ask for.  Her stomach is healin’ well, and she doesn't seem too bothered by not bein’ able to talk.  If she needs to say something, she has a notepad she can write on.  Speakin’ of…does the phrase ‘White Lady’ mean anythin’ to you?”  I shook my head.

“Not really.”  Curly took a sip of coffee and grimaced.  

“She's been writin’ that a few times.  Seems to really upset her that nobody knows what it means.”  He shrugged.  “But, hey, they're talkin’ about letting her out in another week or two!”  I sat down across from him with my own food.

“What are you going to do then?” 

“Go home.”  Curly set his hat on the table next to him.  “My dad's fixin’ to retire soon, and I told him I'd be willing to take over the ranch.  And I'm takin' Alice with me.  We've gotten real close over the last few months, and I wanna be able to keep takin' care of her.  I think the fresh air oughta be good for her.”  I leaned my chin on my hand.

“Sounds like a good plan.”  He nodded.

“We just gotta get outta this town, Miss Livy.  Somethin’ wrong about it.”  He took a large bite of his sandwich before pointing at me with it.  “You should get out of here too while you still can, both of ya…’fore somebody else gets hurt.”  After a moment of silence, he wrapped the rest of his sandwich up in a napkin.  “Listen…you think V would mind if I dropped by and visited him before I head out for the night?”  

“I don’t know if he’s awake yet, but I don’t see how it would hurt anything.”  

By the time we made it back to Victor’s room, he was just starting to wake up, blinking slowly.  

“Ouch,” he mumbled, before his eyes managed to focus a bit and he saw who was standing at the end of his bed.  “Curly…?”  

“Hey, buddy.  Figured I’d drop by for a sec and see how you’re holdin’ up,” Curly said, circling around to the side of the bed and patting Victor’s shoulder.  Victor let out a whine, reaching up and briefly resting a hand over his.  

“Not so good…I think I went a little stir-crazy for a minute.”  The two of them talked for a bit before Curly had to head out, tipping his hat to me as he left.  Victor sighed, letting his head flop back against the pillow.  “I’m sorry,” he said after a while, grabbing my hand.  

“For what?”

“Causing such a fuss…I didn’t mean to upset you, I…”  He sighed, rubbing his eyes with his free hand.  “She’s in my head, Livy.  I can feel her in there, gnawing at everything, and I don’t think she’ll stop until only the hurt is left.”  He shivered, staring up at the ceiling.

“The statue?”  I could only assume that’s who he was talking about.  His head snapped over to face me, eyes wide.

“How do you know about that?” he demanded, trying to sit up but being too weak to do so.  

“Whoa whoa whoa, hey, it’s okay, just stay there.  You lost a lot of blood, big guy.”  I fluffed up his pillow a bit and ruffled his hair.  “I um…I may have come to the gallery early one night and seen it.  I wanted to ask you about it sooner, but I didn’t want you to freak out.”  Victor sighed, closing his eyes for a moment.  

“She’s not a statue,” he said finally.  “The statue is just a representation of her.”  

“Who is she?  Madame Blanc?”  

“Nonono, Madame Blanc only works for her.  Has for a long time.”  He shivered again, and I tucked the blanket around him a bit more.  “We don’t know what she is, but if we continue to create things for her, she’ll help us in exchange.”  I frowned.  This sounded an awful lot like some weird cult bullshit.

“What kind of help?”  Part of me was debating whether to call Andrew or call a priest, the other part just wanted to make sure Madame Blanc and all the other creepy crawlies associated with the Inferno Gallery stayed far away from my boyfriend.  I’d do it myself if I had to, I just didn’t know *what* to do.

“The usual kind,” Victor said.  “Money, fame, success, inspiration, just about anything an artist could wish for.  Well…almost anything.”  A wry smile crossed his face.  “Even a saint couldn’t make someone as good as you fall in love with me.”  I rolled my eyes, pecking his cheek.

“You’re such a dork, Vic.”

“Well, yeah, but I’m *your* dork, right?”  

“Yeah, you’re right.”  All of a sudden, I remembered something Curly had said earlier.  “Hey, Vic?”

“Hm?”

“Does the phrase ‘White Lady’ mean anything to you?”  He scooted up a bit in the bed.

“Why do you ask?”  I absent-mindedly chewed on a hangnail that had been bothering me for a while.

“When I ran into Curly in the cafeteria, he told me Alice has been writing it down for a while, and she gets really frustrated because nobody understands what it means.”  I sat there for a moment in silence, gnawing at the hangnail until a sharp pain ran through my finger.  Glancing down, I realized I’d bitten it so hard that I’d made it bleed, a single crimson drop running down my finger and landing on the hospital sheets below.  Victor grabbed a tissue from the bedside table and wrapped it around my finger, holding it.

“I keep telling you, baby, you’ve got to quit chewing on your fingers.  If you needed something to bite, I’m right here,” he teased.  Ordinarily, I would have laughed and smacked him for being so forward, but right now I was preoccupied with the red splotch on the blank white sheet.  Blank…Blanc.  I felt so stupid right then.

“Madame Blanc,” I whispered.  Victor raised an eyebrow.

“What?”  I looked up at him, eyes wide.

“Haven’t you stopped to wonder why Madame Blanc hasn’t been around lately?  Ever since the gallery closed, she’s completely disappeared.  She hasn’t come to visit Alice at all, as far as I know.  Very suspicious for someone who is your ‘mysterious benefactress’.”  Victor’s brow furrowed, though he couldn’t stifle a brief smile at my imitation of his accent.

“I had noticed that, now that you mention it.  But why is it so important?” he remarked, still holding the tissue around my finger.  I was practically bouncing up and down in my chair.

“Victor, don’t you see?  Alice kept writing the words ‘White Lady’ because she was trying to warn us about Madame Blanc!  Maybe Madame Blanc is the one who attacked her!”

“But the police didn’t find any fingerprints at the apartment other than Alice’s,” Victor said.  “And I can’t imagine Madame Blanc would be capable of doing such a thing, she’s so old and small.  But…”  He trailed off.

“What?  What is it?”  Victor turned to me, his face draining of all color.

“No fingerprints…every time I’ve seen her, Madame Blanc is always wearing gloves.”  All of a sudden, he made a crab-claw motion towards his clothes, which had been neatly folded on a nearby counter.  “Phone.  Please.”  I handed him his phone, and he frantically dialed before punching the speakerphone button.  

“Howdy,” came Curly’s voice through the phone.

“Curly?  It’s Victor.  Don’t go home tonight, stay in a motel.”

“Why, what’s happenin’?” Curly asked.  I could hear a rumbling in the background; he must still be on the road, I thought.  Victor briefly explained the situation.

“That’s why Alice kept writing ‘White Lady’,” I chimed in, leaning forward so Curly could hear me better.  I heard the brief *ding* of a turn signal.

“I swear, I’m gonna marry that girl, she’s so damn smart,” Curly said.  “I mean, I was just pullin’ up to my house now…”  He suddenly trailed off, and I heard him mutter “What in tarnation?” before a sudden loud *thunk* was heard and he screamed.  

“Curly!  What’s happening?”  For a few agonizing minutes, we heard nothing but the squealing of tires and Curly throwing out every profanity in the book (excluding racial slurs).  Finally, the squealing evened out to a low rumble.

“She was…she was in my house,” Curly finally said in a bewildered tone.  “She came chargin’ outta the front door like a crashed-out bull, and then she was jumpin’ on the windshield, it’s a miracle I managed to shake her off…she’s just a sweet lil’ old lady, how did she do that?”

“We don’t know.  But obviously it’s not safe for any of us to be at home right now,” Victor said, seeming a bit calmer now that Curly was out of immediate danger.

“Yeah, no foolin–what in the name of marmalade!”  Curly had apparently stepped on the gas as the rumble grew louder.  “What the hell, jumpin’ Jehoshaphat, she’s followin’ my truck!  Gimme a sec, Imma see if I can lose her.  Then I’m drivin’ back to the hospital.”

“For goodness’ sake, Curly, be *careful,”* Victor warned.  

“Roger that.  I’m gonna hang up now, need both hands on the wheel for this one.  It’s just like herdin’ cattle, just, you know, other way around.  I better not get a speedin’ ticket, I swear to Sam Houston–anyway, I’ll see you when I get back, I ain’t too far away.  Catch up to this, ya old heifer–YEEHAW!”  And with an exuberant whoop, Curly hung up the phone.  

“That crazy cowboy had better know what he’s doing,” Victor muttered, tossing the phone onto the bed.  I, meanwhile, grabbed my own phone and frantically texted Andrew.

*-You need to get to the hospital right now.*

*-What?*

*-It’s Madame Blanc.  We think she’s behind the attacks.  She was in Curly’s house, we just got off the phone with him.*

*-Well, shit.*

*-YEAH.  Please hurry.  Curly’s on his way back here, but we think Alice is in danger.  Victor too.*

*-Wait, y are u and Victor at the hospital?*

*-I’ll explain later, just get here NOW.*

*-Omw.*

Andrew arrived at the hospital first, if the blaring of sirens was any indication.  When he found the room Victor and I were in, I explained the whole situation.  

“We can’t leave Alice by herself, and I don’t know when Curly’s going to be here.  Last we heard, Madame Blanc was following him somehow and he was trying to shake her off.”  Andrew swore under his breath.  

“All right, I’ll go check on Alice, you stay here.”  I knew I was going to have to tell him about the statue after this.  There were so many questions in this situation that I didn’t even know where to begin.  Before I could ask Victor what the hell was happening, there was a noise from outside.  

The room had a singular window looking out on the parking lot, and the blinds were currently open.  All of a sudden, the glow of the lampposts was blocked out by something dark and sticky, the mass leaving trails of viscous fluid down the window.  Victor and I stared at the shape for a moment before it suddenly contorted, and a face popped into view, ghoulish and grinning, the face sagging from the skull.  A long, slender tongue wormed its way out of the creature’s mouth, rubbing up and down the window as if trying to taste something through the glass.   Victor let out a cry of shock, pushed me behind him as best he could, and started fervently chanting something in Ukrainian.  

Before I could ask him what was wrong, footsteps thundered down the hall, and soon the panting, sweating form of Curly burst through the door.  

“I made it back–aw, shit.  She beat me here.”  Fumbling around in his jacket, he pulled out a small black cylinder and aimed it at the window.  There was a bright flash of light, and the creature let out a deafening shriek that sounded like it came from a thousand voices simultaneously before scuttling away.  Curly bent over, resting his hands on his knees.  “Damn,” he said, panting.  “She musta figured out where I was goin’ and decided to just come here anyway.”  He held up the cylinder, and I recognized it as one of those high-powered “tactical” flashlights I was always seeing ads for on TV.  “Good thing I always carry this on me, she don’t like the lights.”

“How do you know?”  He grinned.  

“I may be a hick, but I ain’t stupid, Miss Livy.  All the time I was drivin’, I noticed she kept avoidin’ the streetlights, my headlights, every source of illumination there was.  Figured this would keep her away if she came at me when I got out of the truck.”  All of a sudden, he glanced over his shoulder.  “Alice–”

“Andrew’s with her,” I said.  “And he literally *just* got off-duty when I texted him, so he’s got his gun on him.”

“Thank every god that exists and answers prayers,” said Curly, putting a hand to his forehead.  “She’ll definitely try to get inside,” he said after a moment.  “But, if you think your cop buddy’s got everything under control, I reckon I’ll stay here and look after you two.”  I nodded, grateful for the extra company.  Not that I thought Victor wasn’t capable of protecting me on an average day, but he was injured at the moment and still pretty weak.

“Thank you, Curly,” I said.  He smiled and took the other chair in the room.

“Don’t mention it.  That’s just what friends ought to do.”  I pulled out my phone and texted Andrew, letting him know what Curly had said about Madame Blanc avoiding the lights.  That was good to know, just in case she did get in, even if the hospital lights were very bright.

Of course, as my luck would have it, just as I had that thought, there was a loud pop and *fizzzz* noise from above us.

I was mad at myself for being the person I am that needs answers, needs things to make sense. I can hear the most heartbreaking or infuriating truth, but as long as it makes sense in my brain, somewhere along the way I can get over my emotions, gather the facts, and be able to process what is happening in a way I can manage existence.  
YOU DO NOT MAKE SENSE, SIR!  
Either get honest or become a better liar. I can't take both. Your stories make no sense. They aren't logical. YOU ARE A TERRIBLE FUCKING LIAR! DO BETTER!  
I have been doing an incredible job of keeping the peace, keeping things even, deflecting thoughts and emotions, so I can just live with some sense of calm and happiness in the wtf ass marriage I have. 95% of the time I don't care; not my business, not my concern. But today was the 5% when your actions made no sense at all and the anger that welled up inside of me over the fact that you actually expected me to believe your bullshit ass reasoning...ARRRGGGHHHHH! Lying to me when I am speaking facts to you and asking you to ""Make it make sense"", is like calling me stupid in my face. Maybe I am stupid. I take full responsibility for being where I am today. Its my fault for not ending this back in April 2018. But all of the bullshit, abuse, and betrayal, you did that.  
I am just mad at myself. I am not even mad at you anymore. I am not surprise by your actions. I am mad at myself.  
I am mad at myself for not being strong enough to leave. I am mad at myself for accepting the bare minimum. I am mad at myself for accepting the cushy, basic needs met lifestyle. I'm not wrong for expecting to have a slowed down lifestyle. I realize not everyone has that and maybe never will. I appreciate all the good things about my life. Its the bad that is completely unnecessary. Its truly cruel the way you twist and shake things.  
I've gotten through my day. I am here having a margarita, typing up this message. I'll be ok. I'm just frustrated at myself.  
I know you didn't divert your plans this morning at 6am premeditated. I know something else occurred between the time you got to the driveway to the time you got out of one truck to get into the other truck. I know you did this because you thought on the off chance I might check the truck gps and see where you went. I know your story about going to get gas cans, tacos, and coffee, was a lie. I know it cost us an extra $200 because you were late to where you were supposed to be at 8am because you were doing whatever the fuck you who doing between 6:10 and 7:30am. I know it wasn't originally part of your morning's plans but you went along with it anyway and then you lied to me when I asked you. You lied to me when I told you your story made no sense. You lied to me when asked about it all. I laid out all the facts for you and reasoning and you flat out fucking lied, like you always do. Then when I wouldn't accept your lies and truth, you turned it around on me, blaming me, reprimanding me, and then inevitably like you always do, ""I want a divorce"" only this time I told you to serve it up. Why wait? Bring me the papers to sign. I don't want anything from you. This is my house. You take the trucks and our business and get the fuck on with your life so I can get on with mine. I am entitled to have you pay for my existence, by law,  after we divorce, but I don't even want it. I want to be completely clean from you. I am not the liar. I am not the cheater. I am not the one who betrays constantly. YOU ARE!   
Fuck. Well today was my 5% i guess. I'll go back to 95% good now. ",1,1739309138.0,LiesInTheSun,0,1.0,False

It can be frustrating when you're staring at a blank page, trying to find the right words.

From my own experience, the key is not to force it. Instead, I try to give myself a little breathing room. Sometimes stepping away from the task for a bit helps clear the mental fog. Even a short walk or a coffee break can reset my mind.

Another thing that helps is breaking the task down into smaller chunks. Instead of focusing on writing the entire article, I start by outlining my main points or drafting a quick intro. Once you get the first few lines out, it’s easier to keep going.

Also, I find that writing in a different environment or switching up your routine can spark new ideas. Whether it’s a new coffee shop, a park bench, or just a different part of your home office, changing your surroundings can work wonders.

Lastly, don’t be afraid to write badly. The first draft doesn’t need to be perfect; just get the ideas out. You can always refine later.

1in9lyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1in9lyz/i_had_no_idea/,I had no idea...,"I (32 F) had the strange urge to look up an obituary of a client from work that I barely know, something I never do unless it’s a close family member or friend. This person had a really long last name that not many people can spell properly but I knew that they resided in my first hometown. I googled up my hometown’s obituaries and to my horror and shock, the first name that popped up in the search engine was a former neighbor and a childhood friend (33 M) who I haven’t seen in about 25 years. Let’s calI him “Kevin”. I completely forgot about the client and I immediately clicked onto the link of Kevin’s obituary. I learned that not only he died a year a half ago but also three days after I got married. Not months, not weeks, DAYS. I didn’t cry but I had a horrible stomach ache and a lump in my throat right after reading it. I was gutted. I later found out from my dad that Kevin died from cardiac arrest due to an enlargened heart. 

For context, I lived in an awesome neighborhood in the earlier half of my childhood where I was part of a solid friend group who consisted of 10 kids who were close to my age. We all saw each other as a little family of our own. I have so many fond memories of each of those kids, especially Kevin. Our dads were really good friends for several years but unfortunately our moms did not get along with each other too well since Kevin’s mom was part of the neighborhood’s “mom clique”. I really liked his mom and she always treated me very well as far as I can remember. My mom had trouble getting along with the other neighbors (especially the women) there due to some serious trust issues from her abusive childhood. As a result, my family moved out of that neighborhood to another one in the next town over that I wound up hating all because of a petty neighborhood disagreement she had with the mom clique. It was something that could have been easily resolved and definitely not worth moving to a totally different town. 

When I broke the news to the friend group, they were all sad but I’ll never forget Kevin’s reaction. He was trying his best not to cry in front of me and I could tell that he was struggling holding back tears. After I moved, we all tried our best to keep in touch but it just grew too difficult due to lack of social media at the time (this happened in 2001) over time. It also didn’t help that I was one of the youngest ones and we all matured at different rates. Eventually, we all drifted and life just happened. As the years passed, I only thought of them occasionally until… now. 

I had no idea that Kevin’s death would impact me so much. What was once a distant memory now replays in the back of my head like a glitching video that won’t turn off. I’m not depressed and I’m able to function normally but random triggers do hit me at unexpected moments. I sometimes find myself imagining scenarios of us randomly bumping into each other somewhere (like a grocery store or a coffee shop) and think of what questions I would have asked him and give him updates of my life. I even had a nightmare about Kevin’s funeral a couple of nights ago, with his little kid self dead in the casket, despite dying at 33 and it jolted me awake in the middle of the night. I sometimes creep on his Facebook profile just to see pictures of him and maybe just feel some sort of connection with him. My husband (33 M) has been extremely supportive but I can tell that he doesn’t fully understand the impact it’s had on me so I really don’t talk about it that much to him. Same with my parents (60s M/F), who harshly judged me for grieving my childhood cat 12 years ago, demanding why I cried over a cat more than my grandpa, who died after a long battle with Alzheimer’s. They’re old school boomers who have a very poor understanding of mental health. If they were this unsupportive over my beloved kitty, who was my very first best friend (we got her when I was four), God knows how they’ll react to how I’m currently handling Kevin’s death. 

Anyway, I’m just so confused right now. I never expected to grieve this much over someone I haven’t seen or heard from for over two decades. I’ve had a few old friends/acquaintances from high school and college pass away but none of these deaths hurt me this much at all. Nowhere near it. This has been the most difficult non familial/pet death for me personally. I had no idea. 

TLDR; Childhood friend I haven't seen in years died, hit me a lot harder than I expected

When we met, we mutually agreed we didn't wanna get married,  as both of us were divorced at this time. Our relationship was progressing slowly but steady.  We always had some minor adjustments to do (deciding how to split chores, adjusting our friend circle) but nothing that couldn't be solved.  He is very closed off and not the one to come openly for a discussion.  Recently,  I picked up his phone to check the time and saw his fb messenger open. He was talking to another woman. He said she was hard to find. They spoke about each ones relationship and he said, I have a ""girlfriend "" in quotes , we've been dating since one year, I don't think it'll last long. He was also inviting the other woman to come to our country as it is nice here (she lives in his native country). He claims now she's just an old acquaintance from college.  The bigger problem is that we've actually been together for 5 years and technically,  are engaged.  As I said,  we agreed we didn't want a wedding or get married,  but I wanted smth to show our commitment to each other.  And the time I discovered his messages, we were going through a rough patch (not an excuse,  just giving all the details). He since deleted all the messages,  so clearly he understands this was wrong.  I know he can't be cheating physically,  but is he already looking for someone else to replace me? Hadn't it been for this message, I wouldn't have guessed he is looking for someone else.  He's very affectionate,  does little things, cleans my car, coffee in the morning.  We spend quality time together and generally are happy. I do love him, and it hurts me a lot to break up with him.   Please advise.

Thursday night, I caught a man digging through a dumpster behind the grocery store. Frost on his beard. Empty stomach. I bought him a sandwich and a coffee. Not with city funds—\*my own damn money.\*

\*\*Incident #3:\*\*  

This morning, a call came in about a “suspicious loiterer” near the playground. It was a single mom, waiting for her kid’s bus. She couldn’t afford daycare. I sat with her. Told her about the 24-hour laundromat where security doesn’t chase you off.

\*\*THE SYSTEM’S PLAYBOOK:\*\*  

1. \*\*Delay:\*\* Tell victims help is “processing” until they give up or die.  

2. \*\*Redirect:\*\* Move problems to someone else’s district.  

3. \*\*Gaslight:\*\* Convince us we’re the villains.  



Case in point: My supervisor’s exact words during my suspension hearing:  

\*\*\*“Compassion is a malware, Officer. It corrupts the protocol.”\*\*\*

\*\*WHAT THEY DON’T WANT YOU TO KNOW:\*\*  

There’s a code in our system—\*\*“44-Unauthorized.”\*\* It flags citizens who’ve filed too many complaints. I looked up Mrs. Evers after they confiscated her check. Code 44. The man at the dumpster? Code 44. The mom? Code-fucking-44.

\*\*LAST NIGHT:\*\*  

I tried to resign. My badge wouldn’t unlatch. The HR portal crashed. My patrol car’s GPS rerouted me to the station. Over and over.  



At 3 AM, a text from an unknown number:

They’ll say I broke. That I hallucinated. But check the public logs:  

\- \*\*Case #2917:\*\* Mrs. Evers’ pension check? \*“Resolved.”\* How? She died waiting.  

\- \*\*Case #2918:\*\* The dumpster man? Arrested for “theft of public waste.” His crime? Eating moldy bread.  

\- \*\*Case #2919:\*\* The mom? Charged with “unlicensed guardianship.” Her kid’s in the system now.  



I’m still in uniform. They won’t let me take it off.

1in9ctj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1in9ctj/recently_obtained_a_new_kitten_worried_about/,"Recently obtained a new kitten, worried about making him too clingy/dependent","So recently I've adopted new kitten, he's a former stray, about 3-4 months according to his previous owners. He's only been at my place for a few days and he's bonded with me very quickly, he's super sweet and affectionate cuddly, in a way that I'm not used to with cats (most cats I've had before either are just closer to my other family members or have had more aloof/distant personalities, and I still love them but it's always been rather one-sided lol). He's bringing a lot of joy into my life and I love him beyond words, but I'm worried that I'm giving him too much attention and that I'm teaching him to basically be not okay without me, but I also don't know how to behave otherwise.

He's already pretty much purring and meowing at me all day and always demanding attention, sometimes in a way where I'm not sure what exactly he wants, I play with him and cuddle and pet him and everything I can think of to show my love but he often doesn't seem satisfied, or at least, I don't always know how much he needs to be satisfied. He has had precious few moments where I can confidently leave him alone where he entertains himself and plays with his toys and seems satisfied enough when he does so, but he does it for a short time before coming back to meowing and purring and pawing at my hands and/or my ankles and trying to grab/bite at me, and often in the morning I struggle to do basic things like even getting my coffee and breakfast with how demanding he gets. 

I also suspect he basically only eats when there are other people there to watch because he often seems to meow at me to ask me to be with him when he eats, and he tends to look back at me as if to make sure I'm watching, and I'm not the best at tracking his food bowl but I try and it definitely seems like he doesn't eat from it when I'm not there to watch.

Obviously, a new kitten needs time to adjust and will be extra clingy within the first week, and he's still very small and is in need of a parent and that's what I essentially am for him right now, and he's a former stray, and his previous owners were a huge family with parents and kids and three other cats (and they've had people coming to visit basically all the time) and now he's in a house where it's just me and my dad who isn't home most of the day so it's a huge change from a big noisy house to a quiet one with just me. Plenty of reasons that it makes sense for him to be clingy, or that he might be anxious and expressing that with clinginess. But I still can't help but worry that this is indicative of future behavior or potential problems. 

I try to respond to this situation and give him affection and reassurance, especially since a kitten who is a former stray must surely need that even more than a newly adopted adult cat, but how much is too much? Where do I draw the line? I try to establish boundaries where I can, if he hurts me or scratches me I stop playing, I don't let him into my room at night if he's in full on zoomies mode not letting me sleep, I have rooms that I keep consistently closed because he's made messes there before, the importance of establishing these boundaries early is pretty clear so I try where I can.

There are also times where I need to work at my desk and I simply cannot give him attention because I'm occupied and then he comes in meowing at me and scratching at my door and it just hurts not to let him in when I hear his adorable sweet little meows, and if I keep the door closed I feel like I'm being cruel and neglecting him when he needs me, and yet it also feels like I'm enabling/encouraging his clinginess and teaching him that this is is a good way to get what he wants when I give in and let him in, and again, often this means I can't keep working or doing what I'm busy with. And right now I'm working from home and spend most of my time in the house but that's very much a temporary thing, and I worry that it's going to be all the more traumatizing for him when I'm consistently out of the house if I don't get him used to my absence soon, but I also am not sure how to do that correctly. 

So. I guess to sum up this big ramble of a question (and I apologize that this isn't more concise, this is just how I am) how do you balance this out? How do you know when you're giving a newly adopted cat the right amount of attention and when it's enabling/encouraging them to be dependent on you? How do you teach a kitten to be okay when you're not around without denying them attention they need at that age? How do you know when it's the right time to draw the line and establish the boundary, and when you're denying them affection that they need, the absence of which will only make them more clingy? I know it's a very thin line and delicate balance in any situation in any case where you're adopting a new cat, but I would appreciate any experience and wisdom you guys might have to offer on the matter.",1,1739307823.0,CatAdvice,1,1.0,False

1in98vf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in98vf,Winter camping in Wisconsin,"Was on a work trip to Wisconsin and decided to take the long-ish weekend to go camping. I usually head to NF to camp but didn’t see much options for that in WI, so looked at the state parks. Most were closed but I found one that had “backpacking” sites and found a site right on the banks of Lake Michigan. Since I’d never been to any of the Great Lakes, I thought perfect!

Got to the place and parked (was the only car there) and started walking right at about dusk. Moon was out and the 3-4” of snow on the ground made the ~2 mile hike easy, even without my headlamp on. Was super happy with my Salomon Speedcross 5 GTX trail runners. Feet were cool, but not wet! Also was happy to have my Garmin watch, and used it to make sure I was on the trail to the campsite the whole time. The hike was super quiet, and when I got to the site, found 2 benches, a fire ring (with a grill grate) and a bear box. 

Since I’d never camped in the snow, I was not ready for the fact that I was only able to get one of my tent stakes in the frozen ground, but it was my vestibule one, so I was lucky!

Got the tent up, and started gathering firewood. Man it was super dry and plentiful, so the fire caught on quickly. Not used to that being from the south ha. Had a nice dinner and listened to the sounds of the lake slush lapping against the bank (which sounded like slow footsteps in the snow at first 😬). 

Slept pretty well, even though it got down to the teens. Snowed overnight  couple inches but I was good to go with all my layers etc. 

Next morning was absolutely stunning to see the landscape. What looked like swans were floating on the lake. Had breakfast and coffee, found a friend under the bear box, a shrew I think, packed up and hiked out. Wish I could camp like that more often!",22,1739307572.0,camping,3,0.91,False

Read My Review!,"Testing coffee grinders daily means I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the downright noisy. The Wancle P00273 Coffee Grinder, also known as the Wancle Electric Coffee Grinder, caught my eye for its compact design and promise of quick, consistent results. I put it to the test for weeks, grinding not just coffee beans but also spices and seeds. My experience with this grinder has been mostly positive, but there are definitely a few quirks worth noting.

The first thing I noticed about this grinder is its design. At 6.6 inches tall and 3.5 inches wide, it’s small enough to fit on my crowded kitchen counter without taking up much space. The black finish gives it a sleek, modern look, though I wouldn’t call it fancy. It feels lightweight at just under a pound, which makes it easy to move around, but it does raise concerns about durability. The transparent lid is a nice touch, letting me monitor the grind level without having to stop midway.

Performance-wise, this grinder is a speedy little machine. Its stainless steel blades and pure copper motor grind coffee beans quickly—just a few seconds for a fine espresso powder. The one-touch operation is incredibly straightforward. Press the button, and the grinding starts. Release it, and it stops. This simplicity is perfect for early mornings when I’m not quite awake yet. However, the 60-gram capacity might feel limiting if you’re brewing for more than two people. I’ve had to grind multiple batches for larger pots of coffee, which can be a bit tedious.

[Check Wancle P00273 Coffee Grinder price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/wancle-p00273-coffee-grinder-review-b08ppglk8z/)

**Pros**

1. **Compact and Lightweight**: Fits easily into small spaces and is simple to store.
2. **Quick Grinding**: The motor and blade combination delivers fast results.
3. **Multi-Purpose Use**: Works well for coffee beans, spices, nuts, and seeds.
4. **Easy to Operate**: One-button functionality makes it user-friendly.
5. **Transparent Lid**: Allows you to see the grind consistency without stopping.

**Cons**

1. **Small Capacity**: Limited to 60 grams of beans at a time.
2. **Noise Levels**: Not as quiet as some competitors, though manageable.
3. **Uneven Grind**: Inconsistent results when grinding larger quantities.
4. **Short Power Cord**: At around 20 inches, it might not reach all outlets.
5. **Non-Removable Blade**: Cleaning can be tricky and requires extra care.

Comparing this grinder to others I’ve used, it holds up well in certain areas but falls short in others. For instance, the KRUPS GX332850 offers a similar quick grind but has a slightly more robust build quality. On the flip side, the Cuisinart DBM-8 may provide a more consistent grind, especially for coarser settings, but its larger footprint makes it less suited for small kitchens. The Wancle excels in its simplicity and versatility, making it a great option for those who need an affordable, no-frills grinder.

From a cost perspective, the Wancle is reasonably priced for what it offers. While it doesn’t have the precision of high-end burr grinders, its speed and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for casual coffee drinkers. If you’re someone who only grinds beans occasionally or uses it for grinding spices, the value is hard to beat. However, if you’re a coffee connoisseur looking for perfectly uniform grinds, you might want to explore pricier options.

In terms of features, the grinder is fairly basic but functional. The stainless steel blades are sharp enough to handle a variety of tasks, from coffee beans to flaxseeds. The transparent lid and one-button operation simplify the process, but the lack of adjustable grind settings means you’ll need to control the grind size manually by varying the grinding time. For finer grinds like espresso, keep the button pressed for longer; for coarser grinds, shorter bursts work best.

The cleaning process is straightforward but requires caution. Since the blade is not removable, I found the included cleaning brush handy for reaching into tight corners. A damp cloth works well for wiping down the interior, but you’ll need to be careful not to submerge the unit in water.

I wasn't ever expecting them to turn out to the amazing standard I see posted here, and have always been intimidated by the above techniques- I am not particularly artistically skilled, and am colourblind, so the wet blend in particular was a leap of faith.

I went in with a practice mindset and had a great time painting, and had achieved a colour gradient and freehand I was really pleased with and proud of. Then I applied my wash- something I'm usually much more practiced and comfortable with- and had an absolute coffee staining disaster of meltdown proportion. I've never seen a wash go so badly.

I did my best at damage control, but I'm worried I completely fucked my wet blend. I also had to completely repaint the shields, and I don't like how the redrawn freehand has come out. I'm pleased with the faces for a first ever attempt, but in general I'm feeling really discouraged. 

I'm still going to keep painting, because I enjoy the process and relaxation more than the results anyway, but I went from being really proud of them to really disappointed in an instant.

I am seeking representation for FRAYMOON, an adult fantasy of 105,000 words. FRAYMOON mingles magic with low and god-level tech, and the lovely with the unsettling.

Amihan knows her baby, Hintua, is gone. There is a bitter metal smell in her sweetest thing: a changeling. She decides to go to the Fell Mountain, where the ‘good neighbors’ surely have Hintua. She must traverse the world, scale the blade rearing into airless black.

Robbing her in-laws of the faceted jet discs that are the makings of magic, and taking her great-uncle's tools for fighting monsters, she sets off. She is attacked by a beautiful blood-demon, Leofsige, and compels him to her service. Her childhood friend, Liantaika joins them, still hopeful in hopeless love. He has stolen all his brutal master’s charms, including the atsar bombs: vast destruction and poisoned aftermath. Amihan grows fiercer as they leave the backwater tropics, variously becoming a robber-queen, surprising wizards with enchanted revolvers, and avenging a mother-ghost by burning a mahogany tower built without a single nail.

The nations of the south cooperate, and our trio faces ever-more violent onslaughts from the Academic Wizards as they seek the mountain. Some attacks are absurd terror, as charms, constructed of elements such as centipedes and first loves, are idiosyncratic. At one point, a wizard pitches Amihan into scalding coffee with condensed milk, and only Liantaika’s magic saves her. Worse, near-fatally wounded by a retiarius, she is healed in a vat of pink slime into something unwanted: she becomes a great beauty, more like Leofsige than any human. She fears Hintua will never know her. Her fear is realized strangely when they come to the mountain, and all is different than they imagined.

FRAYMOON combines dark cities with a steely village girl: think China Mièville meets Naomi Novik. Readers of Kelly Link’s *White Cat, Black Dog,* and Alex Febey’s *Cities of the Weft* will appreciate remade fairy-tales, baleful and strange. In classic fantasy, this is the world of Wolfe and Vance. 

There is chaste romance in FRAYMOON which does not rise to romantasy.

I have long lived in Singapore after studying Classics, Linguistics, and Philosophy at Columbia and Berkeley. I have published some flash fiction and a coming story.

Thank you for your consideration,

This is 380 words without personalization. I tried to incorporate last week's criticisms. I have an issue in that people have suggested I not include specific story events that seem episodic. However, the most salient feature of the book is that it is weird. Maybe .75 China Mièville weird. I can't just assert: 'this novel is weird,' that's for the agent to decide; it's like saying 'it's funny.' And it's not that the plot isn't good or it's picaresque or merely episodic. It's just that I can't think of a good way to indicate what makes it different from many other novels. Similarly the comps seem long, and I could take out the x meets y comparison, but they are better comps now because they are closer to my novel. The Gene Wolfe/Jack Vance thing is necessary; someone can check on them even if they're not a reader of classic fantasy. Thanks in advance for your suggestions. ",0,1739307389.0,PubTips,1,0.33,False

1in95rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PapaSecundus/comments/1in95rp/a_psoriasis_treatment_guide/,A Psoriasis treatment guide,"Due to numerous chat requests I have received -- which I unfortunately do not always have the time to respond to -- I have decided to write a simple treatment guide for psoriasis outlined below. It is not a one-size-fits-all treatment and it does not list all of the many beneficial substances that can help with the condition. Each person's case is unique to them and can benefit from different approaches. **However**, there are a few key things that I have found to be near-universally helpful to clear up your psoriasis.

# A psoriasis treatment

To clear up your psoriasis, you have to focus on three main things

* Treating underlying infections
* Restoring bile flow and/or supplementing bile acids
* Minimizing inflammation in the body

These suggestions might sound like they're out of left-field, because the reasoning behind this treatment is not conventional. Below this post should be one titled, ""A detailed background on psoriasis \~\~"", which should help explain in very small part the rationale behind this treatment. To avoid mincing words I will plainly lay out the most effective methods to clear up your skin and restore the underlying digestion issue which I believe \*cause\* the psoriasis.

# Supplements

* Ox bile

4000 mg with meals. Lower the dose in cases of diarrhea

* *Ceylonese* cinnamon **bark** oil

Antibiotic equivalent. Biofilm buster. Modulates gut flora. 5 drops with water 3-5x a day. Lower the dose in cases of stomach irritation.

* Lemon oil

D-limonene content dissolves gallstones/intrahepatic calculi. Citrus bioflavonoids block endotoxin absorption and inhibit IL-17. Essential to restore bile flow. 10 drops with water 3-5x a day.

* Peppermint oil

Antibacterial. Biofilm buster. Restores gut motility. 17 drops with water 3-5x a day.

* Oregano oil

Antibacterial. Antifungal. Biofilm buster. You may take this one in pill form.

Note: All oils **MUST** be steam-distilled. Use them in combination with water. Drink through a straw. Don't bother with pills as they are more expensive and less effective.

* The trifecta: Sodium bentonite clay, activated charcoal, diatomaceous earth

Sodium bentonite is an adsorbent AND an absorbent, it will smother the bacteria and prevent herxheimer die-off reactions. Activated charcoal is absorbent, it will bind to the endotoxins directly. Diatomaceous earth penetrates the biofilms and shreds the bacteria up. Very effective in combination with the prior two.

* Serrapeptase or lumbrokinase or NAC

Enzymatic biofilm busters. Doesn't matter which as long as you got one of them. Adding them together is more effective but not required.

* Diet

A diet of mostly fruit and vegetables is recommended. Minimize the fats. Anything that can contribute to inflammation must be excluded during the period of treatment, or it will drastically slow down results. Optimally, a purely liquid diet of vegetable juices is the most effective. Water fasting with herbs will clear the skin up the fastest and break down biofilms rapidly. You can see them in stools within two-three days which will be followed by rapid skin clearance. The less bulk you eat, the more effective the herbs will be. Choose what is most tangible for your lifestyle. I could speak about the dietary aspect for hours, but for simplicity sake, these are your best choices.

This is all you need to effectively treat the psoriasis. There are many, many other treatments and additions I could mention, but nothing else is required but these substances.

# A notable mention

* Castor oil

Take 2 tablespoons in the morning with 1 cup of coffee. Wait 3 hours before eating/drinking. Follow with a coffee enema 5 hours later. Do not do this during a work day. Castor oil is a laxative.

* Coffee enemas

Boil 3 tablespoons of coffee into 1 quart of water. Once cooled\* to warm temperature, insert into rectum. Try and hold it for 15 minutes and expel.

These are two options that are usually considered very extreme and undesirable. I wonder why. They are, however, the most effective substances for clearing up the skin, removing biofilm, and preventing die-off reactions. They have a doubling effect on the treatment. All cases I've seen clear up more rapidly and with fewer reactions using these substances. The biofilms once shed can sit in the gut and become highly inflammatory. Castor oil flushes it out better than anything I've tested.

# How long will it take?

Every case is different, but most will clear up stunningly rapidly *if they follow the full protocol*. Herbs and fasting can lead to complete clearance within two weeks. I've seen it happen in 5 days. Juice fasting usually takes two or three weeks. If you are eating, whatever you eat will dilute the efficacy of the herbs. An average of four weeks. If you eat an inflammatory diet, some of which I described in the other post, it will progress very slowly or not at all. Ultimately you are treating an infection, and feeding that infection in any way will slow results. If you build up the infection more than you're killing it, you will not progress at all.

The first few days usually appear as a gradual worsening of the condition, as the strep bacteria dies off it releases it's inflammatory components, which triggers the lesions. Expect burning, itchiness, and scaling. Following this the skin will rapidly turn smooth, become less raised, lose it's redness and become pink. Followed by discoloration and finally complete remission. This does not mean the infection is resolved, you should continue treatment to ensure that little remains afterwards.

What I've outlined will also greatly enhance the efficacy of conventional treatments. UVB especially.

After treatment, try to eat very healthy and be careful when introducing new foods. Introduce probiotics, I prefer soil-based. Your gut will be sensitive so take it easy.

But when I picture meeting my younger self, it's different. She made mistakes big ones and I’m not sure I could sit across from her in a coffee shop without feeling resentment or frustration. I wouldn't know what to say to her. How could I explain the pain those choices caused? Would I be able to forgive her, or would I just want to tell her to do things differently?

Forgiving her feels like trying to rewrite a chapter of my life that’s already been lived. Maybe one day, I’ll look back and see those mistakes as lessons, but right now, it’s hard to imagine having a peaceful conversation with the person I used to be.""",5,1739307289.0,Kenya,2,1.0,False

It was really hard, and there were moments when I felt like I wasn’t going to make it. I’ve also made a couple of posts asking for advice, wondering when things would get easier, if there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Now, I finally want to share something positive.  

At 14 weeks, things still aren’t perfect, but they’re so much better than they were even a few weeks ago.  

- Her temperament has improved – She’s generally happier during wake windows and will even play independently for a few minutes. That’s enough time for me to grab a bite, shower, or just relax for a moment.  

- She communicates better – Instead of instantly melting down, she gives us warning signs when something is bothering her. That gives us time to meet her needs before she reaches full-on screaming mode.  

- Sleep is more predictable – She goes down around 6–7 p.m. and wakes up around 6 a.m. She still feeds every four hours overnight, so my partner and I are still taking shifts, but overall, it feels more manageable than the chaotic newborn days.  

- She’s learning to play on her own – Watching her engage with toys and discover new things is so rewarding. Seeing her hit little milestones makes all the tough moments feel a bit more worth it.  

- We feel more confident going out again – Around 6 weeks of age, outings started feeling overwhelming, and we stopped going out as much. But lately, we’ve started getting back out—grabbing coffee, running errands, meeting friends—and, for the most part, it’s gone smoothly. No major meltdowns, minimal crying. She mostly just watches the world, feeds, or sleeps.  

- We’re finally weaning off Colief drops – We started using them because she struggled with gas, and it was heartbreaking to see her in so much pain every day. But now, she’s doing well enough that we’ve decided to start weaning her off them, which feels like a huge win.  

That said, I had read so much about the three-month switch, where babies supposedly become easy overnight. That wasn’t the case for us. It’s been a gradual improvement rather than a sudden shift. We still have tough days. She sometimes fights naps like it’s her job, and occasionally evenings are rough.  

She also still contact naps for most of her daytime sleep, which I’m working on because I’d love a little more freedom to get things done or take better care of myself. But at the same time, seeing how fast she’s growing, I’m learning to appreciate these cuddly moments while they last.  

So for anyone in survival mode, wondering when it gets better—I promise it does. It might not be an overnight thing, but little by little, you start to see the light.",1,1739307270.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

First, all the hullabaloo surrounding not having access to the business location’s amenities without a purchase: Everyone was up in arms, fuming that we couldn’t accommodate a cup of water to non-customers. Outrage about charging $7 for one drink flooded the subreddit.

Now, Starbucks brings up a free tall hot or iced standard drip coffee, limit one (1) per Starbucks Rewards member account. Aside from the objectively terrible way it was advertised in promotional emails and on the app itself (specifics of the deal weren’t clear enough, causing customers to come in assuming the free tall drink was ANY handcrafted beverage, frustrating baristas), a free cup of house coffee allows people the access to our lobbies, restrooms, WiFi, and a cup of water.

The way I see it, I feel like the free coffee deal was Starbucks’ corrective response to the backlash of the policy changes. Could they have been clearer with the parameters of the deal to customers? Yes, and they should have; but all that being said, I don’t really get the anger on the barista side. Like, it’s a drip coffee? In all the stores I’ve worked at, the person ordering the drip was a hero during a peak of cold foam and Frappuccino drinks. Yes, there will be customers who come in and argue what a free cup of coffee means (for the record, NOT espresso-based beverages, refreshers, Frappuccinos, teas, or cold brews, to clarify for the customer-folk), but I think if and when this free coffee deal happens again, customers will know for next time that it’s just for house drip.

Yeah, this first day sucked and was annoying to have to explain every time, eating up window times, etc. But, also, like… we got to give some unhoused people free coffee yesterday because they had the app. Some people who’ve lost their jobs because of recent going’s-on with American legislature were able to not worry about spending money on at least one day’s worth of coffee. Broke students were able to have something AND could sit in the lobby to study.

I get it, the execution was horrendous; but at the end of the day, I got to serve decent coffee where I just push 2 buttons, and people got something for free.

1in8xh9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in8xh9,"Filed an HRO against a creepy neighbor, he’ll be served this week","TLDR below

I moved into a new building last summer, CN moved in last fall. We crossed paths at a building HH, I found out he’s new to the area, we’re in adjacent fields, he asked if I wanted to get a casual drink the following Sunday since he’s unfamiliar with the area, I said sure. After bellying up I made it clear I was freshly out of a relationship, not looking for anything with anyone, and I was excited to focus on myself. There was no flirting, no expressed interest. 

After two drinks we walked back to my unit, two floors below him and on the opposite side of the building. He wanted to see my puppy, I unfortunately let him in. As I was playing on the floor, he sat on the couch and said he wanted to massage my back, followed by “you shouldn’t wear shirts like this around me” and put his hands on my shoulders snd slid his right hand underneath my top and bra towards my breast. I snapped at him “wtf are you doing”, moved away, and told him to leave. It all happened so fast, I was shaken. At the door he asked if he could stay over, I said fuck no. He asked if I would kiss him goodnight, I said fuck no. 

Texting started early the next morning. I initially tried to be congenial as we’ll be occupying the same spaces for the foreseeable future.

Then, I left to walk my puppy and found a note he’d left outside my door earlier that said “Headed to Whole Foods. Thinking about you. See you soon … X (heart)O”. 

Thats when I freaked out. My mind went to worst case scenario - this guy is psycho and I’m going to file a harassment order. Having gone through that before for myself and helping a friend, I’m aware of the need to articulate how someone is an active threat to one’s safety and that the petitioner had specifically said to stop. So I played the long game, told him I was uncomfortable, told him to stop, and eventually blocked him telling him why and to stop leaving notes for me.

We’ve been in proximity of each other twice since - once in the park across the street (saw each other from a distance, I walked the opposite direction to avoid contact) and once by the coffee bar (he came down the stairs while I was making coffee, I had over the ear headphones on, we made eye contact for a moment, that was it). After each occasion he proceeded to leave notes outside my door. The most recent one was last week. 

I called a non-profit for advice on writing a Cease and Desist however due to the assault was encouraged to file a Harassment Restraining Order. I contacted another non-profit and they helped me file on Friday. It was approved yesterday (Monday) and he will be served this week. 

Once I have a copy of the approved order, it will come by mail in a day or two, I plan to give a copy to my property management - they’re aware of his history with me but aside from moving units (which wouldn’t really accomplish anything), I’m not sure there’s much else they can do. 

The order asks that he not enter any amenity space that I occupy, specifically the gym, sauna, or elevator. I’m wondering if anyone has had experiences with similar situations. Did the person stop contact? Try to address the order? Push boundaries? I have anxiety and want to prepare myself for what to do if he retaliates in some form. The fact that he even thinks I’d put myself in a swimsuit, in a sauna, in a compromised headspace with him is deranged and scary. I have no idea what to expect from this dude that’s eight years older than me and clearly can’t take “no” for an answer. He knows where I live and where I park.

In my state there are two types of restraining orders: Order For Protection (OFP) for domestic relationships, romantic relationships, etc., and Harrassment Reatraining Order (HRO) for basically everything else. 

Using an alt for obvious reasons. 

TLDR: Creepy neighbor assaulted me in my apartment then harassed me via text and notecard. HRO will be served this week, I’m anxious and concerned about retaliation. ",131,1739306777.0,Apartmentliving,93,0.96,False

1in8rx9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in8rx9,How I cured my EXTREME CHRONIC urticaria,"For many of you this post may seem too good to be true, I was with you. Let me start off by saying this is just what objectively worked for me. I went from 2 types of antihistamines 4x a day to absolutely 0 for the last 6 months. I obviously can't 100% guarantee you a solution, and I am not a doctor. That being said I have done more research on this than most people would expect and If you take the time to read this I think that will be apparent. Also fair warning it is a bit extreme and not cheap. I have 0 affiliation with any company that I mention, I have no way of profiting from this in anyway. Genuinely wish I had someone post this for me years ago and I owe that to you. Again this is just objectively what I used and what worked for me.

As you can see from the first picture, this is how it started. Head to toe, extremely itchy 24/7 felt like bugs crawling all over my body at times. I was put on 2 antihistamines and was told by an allergist I have no signs of environmental allergy and that I was ""allergic to my own body"" in 3 weeks it would reset my immune system and I would be okay after. Of course that wasn't the case. I went to 4 different specialists over the course of 3 years (I still have an appointment scheduled at a university I had to book a year in advance. Keeping it to brag to them haha) and ran countless tests, blood work etc. by that point I was told to just keep managing with anti histamines and I'll have it the rest of my life. 

I do not take no for an answer. 

I needed to eliminate all factors. These all happened over weeks and months, trial and error, finding new research and testing things while listening to my body hyper analyzing small changes. Honestly it became an obsession.

So here's the protocol that worked *for me*

I strictly drink from a water distiller as it removes 99.9% of contaminants, and remineralized with low sodium magnesium drops.

I used a shower filter from a company called ""ProOne""

I changed all clothing to 100% cotton. Everything. Including bed sheets.

All organic body wash, shampoo, deodorant with no aluminum as it impairs glutathione. Non fluoridated charcoal tooth paste (I don't care about the controversy again it's just part of what I switched objectively. That being said hydrofluorocylicic acid does not belong in the body in my opinion and the point was to eliminate anything I could think of that could be a potential factor)

I stumbled upon some research relating chronic spontaneous urticaria to a lipopolysaccharide - short chain fatty acid ratio imbalance. In other words gut disbiosis from not eating enough fruit. That paired with other research linking VEGETABLES to auto immune issues. At this point I was down to try anything so yes I eliminated all vegetables, nuts, roots, stems etc from my diet. Including seasonings, sea salt only. 

It didn't fix it but I could tell it was a positive change.

At this point my diet was basically what a guy named Paul saladino recommends. Again not affiliated or promoting anyone, this is just what worked for me. That being said I did use his freeze dried organ supplements but I'm sure you can find alternatives if you want as they are pricey.

DAO enzyme is a copper dependant enzyme, so naturally you want copper from food sources like liver, thymus, lung, kidney, spleen etc. hard to find these at Kroger and even then I wouldn't eat that.

So I took them in capsules I bought from a guy on the internet LOL.

I will admit I wasn't as strict as I should have been at first. But I could tell that my body was in the process of healing.

I ended up going on a vacation to Florida for about a week and slipped from the diet. It got dramatically worse, no coincidence. Whole vacation ruined. Antihistamines completely stopped working, I was living my worst nightmare 

At this point I'm extremely angry and the only thing I haven't tried that i thought could potentially help was ivermectin. Potentially I was dealing with a parasitic infection, or something microbial, or even cellular (ivermectin triggers apoptosis) and at the very least it could help inflammation.

Go to primary care doctor and he's actually down to let me try it but he expressed his doubts. 

I went 100% all in. I stopped all antihistamines, I went on a strict diet of 100% organic grass fed steak, organic grass fed lamb (I've heard most lamb from Australia is grass fed even if not on label so take that part with a grain of salt, full honesty), pasture raised eggs with no glyphosate residue (according to the carton) raw organic honey in a glass jar, sea salt, organic fruit, tons of organic grape juice not from concentrate and organic coffee mixed with colostrum, trachea, and scapula cartilage for collagen, and 5 ivermectin tabs a day for 3 months. 

The first 2 weeks were the worst 2 weeks of my life, wouldn't wish it on anyone. After that though.... Every single day got dramatically better. Symptoms I didn't even know were related disappeared. Shoulder pain I've had for years? Gone. Extreme acid reflux? Gone. My memory improved dramatically, energy levels improved, brain fog disappeared. The weirdest one is my organs felt like they lost ""heat"". Can't explain it, didnt notice it was there until it went away if that makes sense. Super weird.

Best part is. 0 hives now for the last 6 months. No antihistamines. No itching. Nothing. 100% cured. I hope this helps someone. I'm not here to bs anyone or provide false hope but if you're like I was, anything is worth a try for 3 months. ",0,1739306385.0,urticaria,0,0.5,False

New to Denver and wondering if anyone would be willing to help me move for $50 / hour.  Things are currently in a storage unit in Littleton. Moving it 12 miles away to a townhouse in Golden.

Rented a truck already, so just looking for physical help. A couple things that are heavy (headboard, two couches, mattreas, bookshelf, coffee table, desk), but not too bad. 

Townhouse in Golden has one flight of stairs that the bed and home office things will utilize. The rest is on the first floor.

 If you're physically able and wouldn't mind helping, I would appreciate it. Otherwise, I'll go the movers route. $200 minimum and can't imagine it will take more than 4 hours.

Thank you!",11,1739306118.0,denverlist,12,0.87,False

Look. I’m not asking for much. Just eight uninterrupted hours to refactor this legacy nightmare without someone shoving a USB drive full of “urgent evidence” into my hoodie pocket. But no. \*No.\* Let me paint you a picture of my Monday:  



\*\*8:03 AM:\*\*  

Sit down. Coffee hot. IDE open. Ready to squash a regex bug that’s been haunting me for weeks.  

\*\*8:04 AM:\*\*  

\*Jen from QA materializes behind me.\*  

Jen: \*“They’re rerouting the DNS again.”\*  

Me: \*“Who’s ‘they,’ Jen?”\*  

Jen: \*“The ones\* \*\*\*in\*\*\* \*the DNS.”\*  

She leaves a sticky note on my monitor: \*\*”CHECK THE HEX FOR VOICES.”\*\*  



\*\*9:30 AM:\*\*  

Finally in the zone. Then \*Mark from DevOps\* slams open the server room door, eyes wild.  

Mark: \*“The cloud isn’t a metaphor. It’s a\* \*\*\*literal cloud.\*\*\* \*AWS is just weather control with extra steps. I’ve got logs!”\*  

He proceeds to whiteboard how rain in Wyoming correlates with our API latency spikes. HR has banned him from Expo markers.  



\*\*11:45 AM:\*\*  

Attempt to eat lunch. \*CEO’s EA slides into the cafeteria booth beside me.\*  

EA: \*“He wants you to audit the payroll code. Again.”\*  

Me: \*“Why?”\*  

EA, dead serious: \*“The decimal points are blinking.”\*  



\*\*2:00 PM:\*\*  

Standup meeting. \*Team Lead Dave\* spends 20 minutes explaining why we need to “quantum-proof” our CRUD app before “the big reset.”  

Dave: \*“Haven’t you seen the static in the security cameras? It’s a\* \*\*\*countdown.\*\*\*”  

Static. On the conference room TV. It’s just a broken HDMI cable.  



\*\*4:59 PM:\*\*  

I’m one keystroke away from pushing my fix. Then the \*intern\*—bless his over-caffeinated soul—taps my shoulder.  

Intern: \*“I think the bug is intentional. Like, someone\* \*\*\*put\*\*\* \*it there. To test us. Or maybe… recruit us?”\*  

He shows me a GitHub commit from 2017. Author: \*\*”USER\_GHOST.”\*\*  

Me: \*“That’s an old bot account.”\*  

Intern, vibrating: \*“Bots don’t write poetry in the comments!”\*

\*\*THE CODE IN QUESTION:\*\*  

\`\`\`python

\*\*WHY I’M LOSING IT:\*\*  

\- I’ve found \*\*17 backdoors\*\* in our auth system. Twelve were written by \*us\*.  

\- The office smart fridge now demands retinal scans to dispense LaCroix.  

\- Slack is just alternating GIFs of black holes and Elon Musk smoking weed.  



\*\*THE KICKER?\*\*  

Our app’s fine. The \*real\* glitch is this entire goddamn team. I’m surrounded by people who think Agile is a psyop and Scrum is a synonym for “satanic panic.”  



\*\*SO HERE’S MY ASK:\*\*  

If you’ve ever debugged a while loop while someone whispers \*“the loops are listening,”\* hit me up. I’m either gonna start a cult or quit to go herd alpacas.

I have an issue with an electric underwater vacuum which i use in my job. The device itself is quite good and very handy however the seal to the electronics compartment is sub-par. Around once a week i take it apart and service the rubber seal as the supplier has recommended however after several warranty replacements i am looking for something to prevent the corrosion that eventually sets in. Yes i could just continue having it replaced but this seems wasteful and the manufacturer could at any point decide they are no longer going to cover this issue. The compartment is about the size of a coffee cup. 

My question is what measures could i take to prevent this issue? I was thinking about placing some Desiccant packets in there however i am not sure if this will encourage moisture into the compartment? Is there a spray i can get for cleaning and protecting the circuit board and connectors when servicing it?

1in8hq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1in8hq3/new_york_visit_cocktail_bars_and_drinks_reviewed/,New York visit cocktail bars and drinks - reviewed!,"Just back from a week in New York visiting a friend, and I was lucky enough to get time to hit up 4 good cocktail spots - all solo sadly as he’s not a fan, otherwise I’d have aimed to get to many more together! So I thought I’d jump on here to post a totally subjective, only my opinions, run down of the places and drinks

In chronological order

**The Wayland (East Village)**

Not sure where I picked up this name, I just saw it was starred already on my map, I was in the area and it was the only bar open early enough. By far my favourite spot I went to overall

**Vibes**: Worn in nice neighbourhood bar. Dark and woody but in a slightly dive way, not classy. Very easy to chill out and read in, with a few people propping up the bar. Think anyone could feel happy here unless you want pure classy (and the music got bumped up a bit too loud once 5 hit)

**Price**: $16-17 for basically everything, plus a $10 happy hour something like 4PM-7PM weeknights.

**Drinks**: Bad Bunny - mezcal, fresh carrot juice, tangerine syrup, ginger, lemon, mint. Goddamn, one of my favourite cocktails I’ve ever had honestly. I was worried it might be a bit too fruity or long, but it was perfectly balanced. Managed to taste like a cohesive whole but every element came through, and mezcal as the spirit was inspired - it’s really present in terms of flavour without dominating the lighter flavours with pure alcohol. A must try for anyone visiting who even vaguely likes the sound of this

9th St. Manhattan - bourbon, coffee amaro, orange and Ango bitters. Basically just got this to achieve the “having a Manhattan in Manhattan” goal, especially for that price. Was solid and nicely orange-focused, but didn’t notice anything from the coffee element

**The Dead Rabbit (Financial District)**

Was so keen to get to this given all the acclaim and history behind it, and was near enough to the Tenement Museum to fit into my schedule

**Vibes**: I quite like the famous sawdust floor, and all the photos and bills pinned up gives it a warm vibe. But was rammed and a very young finance worker crowd (duh) which was not the one for a chill solo hangout

**Price**: $16-22, not a surprise to get the price bump given where it is

**Drink**: Twilight Zone - Irish whisky, Guinness, fig, blackcurrant, lemon, baking spices. Man this was a big miss, sweetest thing I’ve got from an acclaimed bar I think. And was meant to be a sour! You could taste the parts with some searching, but it’s basically all creme de cassis upfront. Sure some other drinks on the menu would have worked for me, but I was in a sour mood and I also am always intrigued by beer-cocktails

**Amor y Amargo (East Village)**

Think this shut but has just reopened weeks ago in the original spot? Bitters aren’t my thing, but after a gig next door at Night Club 101 I tried Death & Co (1.5 hour wait of course) I decided to take a chance on this a door down as a lot of cocktail YouTube loves it

Also the gig was Why Bonnie, big recommendation for anyone into the current strain of twangy alt country-inspired indie rock

**Vibes**: Another bad choice for a solo hang, as it’s basically just a bar counter and standing room for … 15-20 people? Plus a Friday night o course. But if you were with people I could see it being very fun exactly because of the size. Terrible lighting though, had to use my phone just to read the menu

**Price**: $18 I think, can’t find the menu online

**Drink**: Bubblicious - can’t remember any of the ingredients, but the description was something bubble-gum focused. I managed to miss that entirely, was thrown by the name and assumed it meant it would be a long fizzy drink. Boy was I wrong, this was like a massive boozy cinnamon chewing gum. It was really interesting and impressive for two sips, then it stopped being my thing - and must have been strong as fuck because it put me right on my ass. I bet there’s something served here I’d love but I couldn’t really work out what to expect from the menu, so wouldn’t be confident in making a good pick

**Clover Club (Brooklyn)**

My one repeat visit from my last trip in 2023. I did the exact same thing this time round, walked over from my friend’s place on the last day in town, had one drink and a read for an hour, then headed to the plane. Nice to repeat it and even sit at the same seat

**Vibes**: Since I sat in the same spot right by the door both times I can’t say for sure. But pretty big, airy feeling for being a typical dark woody cocktail vibes, and there’s a back room with a fire going? That looked very plush

**Price**: $17-23

**Drink**: Clover Club - gin, raspberry, lemon, dry vermouth, egg white. Had to be done! Probably the simplest drink of my trip, but nice to end on a stronger note after the last two misses. Tasted intensely of raspberry, both sweet and tart, and maybe just a little vermouth herbal dryness at the end for a twist.

**Overall verdict** \- love cocktails, hate NYC prices. Would have been happy just going back to The Wayland and working through their whole menu instead of running about different venues tbh. So I suggest anyone visiting the east side should go do that for me asap",2,1739305687.0,cocktails,1,0.75,False

Invest that, and you’ll be a millionaire someday.”* ☕💰

But let’s be real—**cutting out small indulgences won’t magically make you wealthy.** While being mindful of spending is important, financial success isn’t built on deprivation—it’s built on **increasing income, making smart investments, and optimizing big expenses.**

Here’s why the ‘skip the coffee’ advice is flawed:

✅ **It ignores the big picture** – Wealth is built by managing major financial decisions (salary, investing, debt management), not by obsessing over lattes. Cutting a $5 coffee won’t fix bad spending habits if you’re overspending elsewhere.

✅ **It assumes you’ll actually invest the savings** – Most people who cut out small purchases don’t redirect that money into investments—they just spend it elsewhere.

✅ **It doesn’t account for quality of life** – Small daily joys, like a morning coffee, can actually make you feel more motivated and productive. Cutting all ‘fun’ spending can lead to burnout.

✅ **Focusing on income matters more** – Instead of fixating on saving pennies, focus on making dollars. Learning new skills, negotiating a raise, or starting a side hustle will have a much bigger impact on your financial future.

💡 **So what should you do instead?**

* Track your spending and optimize BIG expenses (housing, car payments, subscriptions).
* Automate savings and investments so money grows without you thinking about it.
* Focus on increasing income—salary growth and smart investments will make a real difference.

🔥 **The takeaway?** Buy the damn coffee if it makes you happy—just make sure you’re also making financial moves that actually build wealth.

Hey folks, first-time poster, long-time lurker, and follower of James. I need some help with a brewing dilemma.

The coffee at my small church is *bad*. Like, genuinely offensive. I love my church and the people there, but I can’t sit idly by any longer, I'm here to serve others and love my neighbors. Right now, we are using a percolator and $5 grocery store beans, and the results should be self evident. Buying specialty coffee from a small local roaster (we're in Seattle) is obvious, but finding the right brew method/brewer has got me scratching my head because I also don't want to overcomplicate things.

1. Brews up to 5-6L at a time (ratio based on a typical 340g bag)
2. Easy for non-coffee nerds to use (no massive pour-over operations)
3. Budget-friendly—under $250 total

This week, I’m going to test higher-quality beans in the current percolator (which *desperately* needs a deep clean) and report back. But I’d love to hear from you—what’s my best bet for a solid, easy-to-use batch brewing setup that won’t break the bank?

1in8b5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1in8b5g/the_rise_of_cannabis_tourism/,The Rise of Cannabis Tourism,"In recent years, cannabis has transcended its traditional boundaries, becoming a legitimate and booming industry that goes far beyond the realm of medical and recreational use. One of the most fascinating developments in this evolving landscape is the rise of cannabis tourism. As more places around the world legalize and regulate cannabis, travelers are increasingly seeking destinations where they can explore and experience cannabis culture in unique and immersive ways.

# The Green Revolution in Tourism

Cannabis tourism is not a new concept, but it has gained significant momentum as more regions embrace legalization. For decades, places like Amsterdam have been synonymous with cannabis culture, drawing visitors from around the globe. However, the trend is now expanding beyond the iconic coffee shops of the Netherlands. From the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast, destinations are catering to the growing demand for cannabis-centric experiences.

# Destinations Leading the Way

**1. United States: A State-by-State Exploration**

In the United States, the legal cannabis market has blossomed, with several states offering a variety of cannabis-related tourism options. Cities like Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; and Los Angeles, California, have emerged as hubs for cannabis tourism. These destinations offer a range of activities, including guided cannabis tours, educational workshops, and even luxury cannabis spa treatments.

Colorado, for example, has capitalized on its legalization by developing “Cannabis Tours,” where visitors can explore dispensaries, learn about cultivation, and enjoy cannabis-infused culinary experiences. Similarly, California’s burgeoning cannabis industry has led to the creation of “Cannabis Wine Tours,” blending vineyard visits with cannabis tastings for a truly unique experience.

2. Canada: A Pioneering Nation

Canada was the second country in the world to fully legalize cannabis, and it has quickly become a hotspot for cannabis tourism. Cities like Vancouver and Toronto offer a range of experiences, from guided dispensary tours to cannabis-themed art exhibits. British Columbia, with its stunning natural landscapes, also offers outdoor cannabis experiences, where visitors can enjoy hiking and sightseeing while sampling local strains.

**3. Europe: Amsterdam’s Legacy and Beyond**

Amsterdam remains a classic destination for cannabis enthusiasts, but other European cities are beginning to follow suit. Places like Berlin and Barcelona are emerging as new centers for cannabis tourism, offering a mix of cultural activities and cannabis experiences. Berlin, for example, has embraced its status as a progressive city by hosting cannabis festivals and creating cannabis-themed events.

# The Experience of Cannabis Tourism

Cannabis tourism is about more than just the substance; it’s about the experiences and education that come with it. Many cannabis tours offer insights into the cultivation process, the differences between strains, and the various methods of consumption. Educational aspects are a major draw, as travelers seek to understand the nuances of cannabis and its role in different cultures.

**1. Culinary Adventures**

Cannabis-infused cuisine is one of the most exciting aspects of cannabis tourism. From gourmet dinners to casual eats, culinary experiences are a highlight for many tourists. Chefs are experimenting with cannabis in innovative ways, creating dishes that are both delicious and educational.

**2. Wellness and Relaxation**

Cannabis tourism also intersects with wellness and relaxation. Many destinations offer cannabis-infused spa treatments, yoga sessions, and wellness retreats. These experiences often focus on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, providing a holistic approach to relaxation and self-care.

**3. Cultural and Social Experiences**

Cannabis tourism also encompasses cultural and social aspects. Festivals, art exhibitions, and music events centered around cannabis offer unique opportunities for travelers to immerse themselves in the culture. These events often feature local artists, musicians, and educators, creating a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere.

# Challenges and Considerations

While the rise of cannabis tourism presents exciting opportunities, it also brings challenges. Legal regulations vary widely from place to place, and tourists need to be aware of local laws and restrictions. Additionally, the influx of cannabis tourists can strain local resources and create tensions within communities that may not be as enthusiastic about the industry.

# Looking Ahead

The rise of cannabis tourism reflects a broader shift in societal attitudes towards cannabis. As legalization continues to spread, we can expect even more destinations to cater to cannabis enthusiasts. The industry is poised for growth, with innovative experiences and new destinations on the horizon.

For travelers, cannabis tourism offers a unique way to explore new cultures and experiences. Whether it’s a guided tour through a dispensary, a luxurious cannabis spa treatment, or a culinary adventure, the world of cannabis tourism is rich with possibilities. As the industry continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the green rush is far from over, and it’s an exciting time to be a part of it.

#Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe…10:35PM…ish? I think?

[Mikan's Autopsy](#bullet) The cause of death is suffocation from blood filling his lungs due to a stab to the neck. The death was within less than a minute. Yes, it was Byakuya Togami. 10:35PM matches what Mikan concluded from her analysis.

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That’s right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope’s Peak isn’t friendship, it’s a building, and it’s filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless…

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.  
 
[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge™️ under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil’s Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole “living” thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya’s corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Crime Scene](#bullet) Byakuya was found in the library archive lying face down head towards the door. Blood can be found on his neck where the stab wound was made and a trail can be observed from his sleeping bag to the door. Blood is on his hands and the door knob. 

[Knives Out](#bullet) A knife was found at the scene of the crime next to Byakuya’s body. The knife has stains of blood on the blade.

[Missing Glue](#bullet) Angie noticed that Fast Acting Glue went missing from the art room at 3:30pm. 

[All the World’s a Stage](#bullet) Chiaki and Kokichi confirm that Byakuya's task was to do public dramatic readings. From 3:30-5:00 PM  Byakuya performed different renditions of Shakespeare to the absolute delight of Kokichi. Chiaki and Komaru were there as well.

[Maintenance Issues](#bullet) Korekiyo investigated the Chemistry Lab and something seems to be clogging the drain of the sink.

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book’s cover with minimal pressure.

[Kirumi's Testimony](#bullet) Kirumi claims that her task entailed cooking a lot of food, so she kept the Kitchen (Biology Lab) occupied from 7:45AM to 10PM. She can testify that Kaito, Maki, Ibuki, Yasuhiro, Komaru, Gundham, Angie, and Himiko, and only these people, entered the kitchen at various times outside of usual meal hours, when the kitchen was not off-limits.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.
 
[Ibuki's Testimony](#bullet) During investigation, Ibuki was investigating the kitchen, and while handling the knife holder, accidentally let her ring fall inside one of the slits. She tried several methods to get it out, but she couldn't find a way into the opening. 

[Mukuro and Maki’s Testimony](#bullet) During their investigation, Mukuro and Maki discussed the possibility of hiding in the Archives. They confirmed that the entrance offered a clear view of all corners. Although they identified a way for a makeshift stack of books to possibly conceal someone, it would stand out enough to arouse suspicion.

[Kitchen Fire](#bullet) Kaito was attempting to cook a very masculine strawberry cake with pink frosting before one thing led to another and (in what could have happened to anyone) started a kitchen fire around 10:30 PM causing the sprinklers to douse the room in water. Maki discovered the commotion and was appropriately disappointed in him. They left the room about fifteen minutes after, with permission from Chiaki, as the room would fix itself overnight.

1in865k,https://i.redd.it/j2cn0q8eikie1.jpeg,I made a mini cookie kingdom idea out of boredom,"Okay so I want to state firstly that I don’t know anything about Cooke run lore, this was done for fun so if it goes against anything lore related I don’t really care lol

My idea is the kingdom of the royal gardens, a place of blooming flora and fauna inspired by older British culture.  Their Queen is Herbal Tea Cookie (the one drawn here), and the residents are mostly based around floral and herbal teas, or in general types of tea

The area is known for being beautiful in color and appearance, but formal and distant with its inhabitants.  The castle walls are covered in thorns and vines to keep outsiders away from the beauty of its internal structure so they dare not taint its luxury

The area is known for its health as it’s mostly taken up by healers, and offer that health to those they can trust will not wilt their precious kingdom (so very very few).  This is all except for any wielders of “coffee magic” like Espresso and Latte Cookie (plus Affogato I guess, they’re technically a coffee), of whom they have zero tolerance for.  Matcha Cookie, Tea Knight Cookie, and Green Tea Mousse Cookie are some of the only known cookies who ever been allowed free entry into the kingdom whenever they’d please.  Herb cookie too as he’s a distant relative of the Queen (based her appearance off him in fact)

Very few know why the Queen is so isolationist, but in truth she wants to protect her people.  To them she’s a goddess of all things earthly, one to bring them fruitfulness and health and prosperity, and she’ll be damned if anyone ever hurts her subjects.  She’s killed thousands for her people, and she’ll kill thousands more if she must.  Don’t let her outward beauty fool you, she’s lived thousands of years and is a hardened warrior who’d fight to the death with everything she has to lose if she doesn’t, she’s stronger than she looks.  Shes seen flowers wither away, but her subjects never will as long as they’re under her protection

I’m posting this here because I think this is the only cookie run game that has kingdoms so it’d fit here-",15,1739304880.0,CookieRunKingdoms,2,1.0,False
1in85x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/1in85x8/why_being_kind_is_so_important/,Why being kind is so important,"There’s so much pain in this world, but I try to remember we can each make it better by spreading kindness. Being kind doesn’t solve things like homelessness, or world hunger, or ongoing wars. But it gives people the courage to keep moving forward day by day with hope for a better future. I was just reminded of that as I was eating at a Wendy’s waiting for my next class today. It was freezing cold outside. There was an elderly woman at a table nearby who I believe was homeless. She was sleeping half of the time I was there, blanket on her lap. Her meal was already eaten. She just needed a warm place to stay. Before I left I asked her if she would like a hot coffee. She said she would love one. It was a small act but the smile on her face when I gave it to her warmed my heart. Im not writing this to brag nor am in seek of any praise. I just want to remind people of how important kindness in a world like this one. Lately I’ve been feeling so hopeless about the state of the world but we all have a purpose to give back to others, especially those in need. That’s what it means to be human.

I am very grateful to have such nice in laws as I have little to no family and the family I have are narcissists (except my brother who lives away). 

Anyway... Heres my examples. 

The most recent example is that due to some housing complications we couldn't give my son his main Christmas present which was a play sofa. It was being stored at theirs, we went round last weekend.... They've been using it all this time since Christmas... Not asked, not told us, they just got it out in front of us like it was entirely normal to give a person SOMEONE ELSES GIFT. 

I am pregnant with my second and have a condition called hyperemesis and my biggest symptom now is smell aversion. I can't be around coffee or makes me feel very unwell, they know this as we've had to live with them for a month recently. On multiple occasions they will make a coffee around me in my own home or when we went out with them and my husband ordered coffee too the table so we had to leave. 

On two occasions they have taken my son on outings without shoes. Not just in the pram but actually going outside and into museums with either no shoes at all or slippers. (On one occasion my husband offered to bring shoes straight round but they couldn't possibly wait and just left without them. No time constraints, nothing booked). 

We have recently moved into a house that needs a lot of work, my FIL is retired and loves to help to be honest he's decided he wants to be here every day doing most of the work BUT he keeps moving all of our things and boxes. Every time I unpack something or place a box somewhere so I know where it is he moves it somewhere else so I'm constantly unaware of where things are in my own house. 

All of these things I bring up with my husband why I'm upset or whatever and his response is always ""I just don't think they realise"".  Then nothing is said to them because he protects their feelings at all costs. I am highly sensitive so lots of these things are a bigger deal to me than others but I find it so hard so understand how someone just 'wouldnt realise' ITS NOT NORMAL TO GIVE PEOPLE GIFTS FROM OTHERS.

Hi Friends,

I have accumulated many samples and decants (and a couple full bottles) over the past few months. They are weighing me down. There are some Montagnes as well as other clone houses like ALT and Barretts. And lots of smaller samples that were purchased either from sellers here on Reddit or from sites like Scent Split and DecantX.

I'm mostly looking to sell them. I can't really think of anything I'm looking to get as a trade. I did recently get one sample that I really like but it's doubtful anyone has it to trade: African Roobios by Chris Collins.

I'll accept Venmo or Paypal. I might not be able to ship anything out until Friday though. I have to be at a work retreat on Wednesday and Thursday that will be all day long. Shipping will be $5 on orders under $50, free for more than that.

Whatever doesn't sell here will be put up for sale in [r/fragranceswap](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceswap/) in a couple days.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

1in830u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assyria/comments/1in830u/would_you_support_an_international_assyrian/,Would you support an international Assyrian treasury,"I’d like to ask Assyrians if you would support an international Assyrian treasury.

As we all know a nation cannot exist without money and nation’s wallet is its treasury.

Assyrians may not have a nation, but today we live in what they call the information age, we are all connected globally by the internet, wether it’s communications, information and/or finances, these things have become easier to facilitate globally.

Would you support an Assyrian treasury managed by transparency, accountability and trust, that would collect money from Assyrians globally to support Assyrian politics, Assyrian economic ventures, Assyrian autonomy and ultimately Assyrian nation hood.

I suggest that this treasury be advertised to all Assyrians throughout the world by the Churches, culture events and word of mouth and off course a place like this, the internet. 

The request from this treasury is that, if you are Assyrian you must donate at least $1 USD every month. That’s less than a cup of coffee every month, if you want you can donate more but you must at least give $1.

This initiative should be constantly reminded to Assyrians and should become a well known thing to every Assyrian household.

 
Politically, our politicians should be paid from this treasury and we can also fund lobby groups, economically speaking this treasury should fund infrastructure in majority Assyrians areas.

This treasury would also serve as the go to, clear and concise place where foreign nations can help the Assyrian people/nation.

What do you think, would you donate $1 per month to an Assyrian treasury built on trust, transparency and accountability?

So I want to post here because I don't really ever see it mentioned.  

   If you don't know what autocross is, it's basically a course/track made up of cones. This can be done on a track, in a parking lot, on an airstrip. And I would almost guarantee there is a local SCCA near you somewhere that holds events. Runs are timed and are anywhere between :30 - 1:00 so it's not hard on the car. And if you don't have any kind of track experience you won't be going fast at all. So you really won't be pushing the car, but you will get faster. 

  Cars go one at a time so you are the only one on the track. And they leave ample space before the next car is released. You will need a proper helmet, and those are not cheap. But that's really all you need. Your car can be stock otherwise. 

   These events cost ~$60 and come in all kinds of forms. For example my local track Pikes Peak International Raceway (PPIR) doesn't use cones they section of a part of the infield and let us have at it. 

  These events are safe, easy on the car, and are affordable. I did this type of thing last season and had an absolute blast. I know my car better know, and I am a better driver because of it. 

   Seriously these cars are rotting in the parking lots of cars and coffee events. Take your q to an autocross event this summer.

2023 Q50 AWD lux

BMS Catch can
BMS stage 1
Steel braided brake lines
EBC slotted and dimpled rotors
EBC pads ( on reds ATM used blue on track ) 
Changed to 5w-30 
Use a DOT 5.1 brake fluid. 

This is like the ""Q50 track starter pack"". It doesn't take a lot to make it super capable on track. But that's the beauty of autocross even if your car is stock you can still show up and drive. 

Seriously if you haven't done it before you won't regret it. Its safe for you, the car, and most importantly your wallet. 

-if your in Colorado you want to look up both Rocky Mountain solo(SCCA) and PPIR track attack. But everyone should have a local SCCA near them. Just type the town you live in with SCCA and it will come up. ",1,1739304666.0,q50,2,1.0,False
