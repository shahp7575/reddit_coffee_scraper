1jnid2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/lamedviv/comments/1jnid2s/interlude_bambi_interviews_chief_disciplinarian/,"Interlude: Bambi Interviews Chief Disciplinarian Mistress Nora On The Set: Slave's Zero And Border Bunny Present, Part 2. F/ff female domme, female subs Consensual, Slavery, Humiliation, Bondage..","""My first question is probably on the minds of a lot of Perseverance fans. The last time I was here, Lara told me Sheila had accepted a voluntary demotion as ""Set Bottom Slave"" because the stress of her position and return of her younger sister from alleged sexual exploitation was making it difficult to lead effectively."" One nod of her pretty blond head to acknowledge.

""Layla took Sheila's took Sheila's role as top domme, and Lara took her position as Chief Screenwriter. Layla was doing extremely well as Top Domme, and recieved high praise in the role from cast and crew, including you. How does she, at few short months later, come to be as firmly under your thumb as Sheila?"" Nora looked thoughtful.

""I'm not at liberty to discuss exactly why Layla accepted a demotion, she is more reticent about her reasons being made public then Sheila. Suffice it to say it was her decision, supported by all of us as much as Sheila's."" Nora gazed at me coolly over her coffee cup. My reporter instincts told me everything she told me was the truth, while she was still obviously hiding a lot just by leaving it unsaid.

""And there's no friction, your two bosses and mentors looking to you, Sarah and Sandy for daily leadership, overseen by a hierarchy of Constance and Lara, their former subs?"" I gaze at her pointedly. To her credit she just gives me a wry smile.

""Of course there's been friction. Sandy and Sarah have both given them formal write-ups for lapses in discipline. They're generally well behaved, but they're former tops and leaders, they're going to chafe at being collared and controlled occasionally, even if it is of their own volition."" Impressive, the little trailer trash girl had gotten a vocabulary with her new position. I mentally chimed myself for the thought, I knew a thing or two about being underestimated for being a fake boobed, bleached blond former porn star.

""Could you elaborate on this ""disciplinary process?"" Her grin didn't falter. ""Certainly. Sarah and Sandy have done most of the write ups, though Dave, Constance, Lara and our guest Mistress Jasmine all have that authority over slaves. Sarah has the special privilege as Alpha Slave to put them on report.""

""Once the write-up is submitted, I get an alert from my inbox, review it, and try to convene a disciplinary review board in the Ready Room within 24 hours, schedule permitting.""

""The board usually consists of Constance, Lara, Sandy and myself as Chairwoman, we may call witnesses as needed. Sarah, Cindy and Vivian, our ""Loaner slaves"" from Mistress Katie, act as our enforcers, escorting the slaves before the board. We hear testimony from the slaves about their offenses, and any witnesses. After the board is done questioning them, I sentence them to their punishment. It usually is enacted within 24 hours, as I have to submit a formal punishment plan for review and approval by Mr. Henson, Constance and Lara, are Command Triad, so to speak.""

""What do these punishments entail?"" Nora gave a wicked little smile, looking at each of her wrapped slaves with twinkling mischief. ""That can get a little tedious and drawn out for an interview, I can make the written meticulous records available to you after the interview. The slaves safety and understanding why their being corrected is always my top priority when I have to punish them."" A mischievous eye twinkle says she still enjoys the power she has to punish her former role models.

""I'm sure."" I reply. ""Why have you chosen to present these two women in this fashion for our interview?"" Now her smile looks proud. ""I swaddled them to emphasize their helplessness and dependence, while also showing loving care, when we wrap them up, they know they're safe, even when vulnerable. I wear a fedora and drink from a personalized coffee cup as a nod to Sheila's strength. I had custom camo vet wrap made for Layla, and make her wear her Marine dog tags, as a nod to her resilience. The qualities these two women exemplify are why I'm sitting here teaching them now, I never, ever forget that."" She looks from Sheila to Layla, no lust or gloating, just sincere admiration for her mentors.

"" The drawn on lips and letting their fine, girly assets hang out is just a little sexy pranking, this is a fetish show, after all. Strapping them in the remote control frames is a pure power play, I admit. I'm their queen, their my peons, you know I'd be lying if I didn't enjoy flexing that difference over them, sometimes."" She holds up the remote, as if to emphasize it as the scepter she controls the poor wrapped up older girls, her subjects, with.

Then she looks at me with a frown. This is the mean little brat I've seen in the past. Even with all their protections and safety nets, I'm not sure I'd want to be helpless in her hands like her two former bosses. ""You have a different opinion, Miss Sux? Please share."" Her voice is cold, commanding and imperious.

""This is just a possibly different interpretation, not necessarily my opinion, Nora. You swaddled these two women to emphasize their helplessness and dependence on you, yes. But you know two strong women are going to hate being infantalized, they might feel insecure at their lack of agency, despite their trust of you.

I nod at the fedora on her head and the coffee cup she's sipping from. ""The hat and coffee cup. Layla's custom camo vet wrap and dog tags. You say it's a homage to their qualities that inspire you, strength and resilience. It could be interpreted as a mockery of these poor girls, using tokens from their previous lives to rub in their faces that their your toys, your living dolls whose past lives are now your trophies of their subjugation."" Her eyes narrow dangerously, but do I see a hint of guilt there?

""Speaking of dolls, what screams human toys more then drawing red lips on their gags? You silenced these cuties, is mocking them further really necessary? I know more about you the you think, Nora Jameson. I bet you saved several musty pairs of your dirty panties just two pack these poor ladies mouths, your personal signature on their humiliation."" Now she looks really guilty, and doesn't deny it. Unfortunately for two adorable slaves, I think my assertion is true.

""Finally, strapping them into rotating frames with their girl parts exposed. You said it yourself, the queen lording her power over her two gorgeous bondswomen. The fact they nurtured you to your current position makes the power all the sweeter. You can pose them like toys, is that why they raised you up?""

""I remember my first time here, Sheila told me the Perseverance was about showing women could embrace their power and still be women. A show about a mostly female Starship crew, in a time when there's serious consideration to turning back the clock on women's rights? In an industry that is still fueled by misogyny and ass backwards attitudes towards women? Yet Sheila made it a hit with her writing in the first season!""

""Now you, her protege, make a subjugated mockery of the two formerly most powerful women in the production. It gets overlooked in your rise and accolades that your still a submissive of one, Master Ken, a man. Some might say you're just a tool of the patriarchy, showing that ""bad girls"" who try to be independent end up being submissive to good girls who submit. Even if he hardly sets foot on set, you being his subs, makes these two at least indirectly subject to his male authority. Teach them to dare think for themselves, huh?""

Nora glares at me, but she looks more sad then angry. I feel a little bad myself, maybe I'm too hard on the kid. ""You know, Bambi, we all giggled about you being a dumb bimbo ditz the first time you did a report on us. We were wrong, we know how sharp you are beneath the ditzy porn star act. The bleached blond hair, the fake boobs and squeaky voice, is that not performative protection to placate the ""little boys"" club?""

""Touche."" I reply. Some of my colleagues attribute this girl's rise to pure luck and good looks. This kid is sharp under her pretty little hick act, I can see why the whole cast supports her, she could really go far in life.

""Girls, look at me."" She commands her subs softly. Four, lovely, liquid pools of brown fasten on their Mistress. They seem wary, but not afraid of her. They know nasty suprises are part of their current game, but they trust their young liege implicitly.

""Bambi, ask my girls a couple of questions. You'll probably want to interview them when they can talk more freely later, but I trust your reporter's acumen to gauge whether they're truly afraid of me or not. Girls, answer Mistress Sux as honestly as you can. No answer will get you punished, you have my word as your domme...and friend.""

Two sets of pretty, expressive orbs now fasten on me. I feel a shiver of delight. I prefer boys, I'm engaged to a producer at FNN, as a matter of fact. But...I sort of like girls, too. If not as much as most of the Perseverance gals. I'm the focus of two smoking hot subbie girls, and liking it.

""Sheila, Layla, good seeing you again, girls, really. I appreciate your time here with me as¹ much as your Mistress's."" Mumbling and mmphing that I'm sure translates to ""Thank you, Mistress Sux."" Nora beams with quiet pride at her girls' attention to ettiquette. 

""Do either of you fear for your safety with Mistress Nora? I hear she can be a bit of a bullying big sister with female subs."" No hesitation, Two mmphs for no, followed by a mangled mess that I'm sure are my name and honorific. No, Mistress Sux.

I look in their eyes and see absolute sincerity. ""Do either of you feel her treatment of you demeans the original message of the Perseverance as female empowerment?"" Two solid double mmphs, followed by their game attempts to show me due respect despite their tightly packed mouths.

""Are you proud of Mistress Nora?"" One mmph, muffled ""Mistress"". ""Yes, Mistress Sux."" I nod. ""Thank you girls, I'd like to interview you both when you can speak more freely later, with Mistress Nora's permission, of course."" One mmmph. ""Yes, Mistress Sux."" I feel a little thrill, such obedient little things!

""My sweeties, look at me."" Nora gently commands, and the girls focus on her again. ""I love both of you, to the bottom of my heart. I owe both of you for my seat and power right now. Do either of you believe I don't have your best interests at heart, even when I make a mistake?""

Two mmmphs. ""No, Mistress Nora."" She smiles and looks back and forth at both of her mentors with genuine admiration. They gaze on her adoringly, with love and trust. For a moment I feel excluded from their little circle of warmth. I admit some of my observations might have been a bit hasty.

Now she smiles at me. ""Mistress Sux, would you like to do the honors?"" I smile back, then address the girls. ""Little ones, the adults are talking, drop your eyes now sweeties."" One mmph, instant obedience. Yes, Mistress Sux. Mistress Sux, I could get used to...this.

Nora's smiles at me lasciviously. ""And here I thought you said last time you'd never get a handle on ""this fetish stuff."" She giggles. ""Mistress Sux.""

We sip our coffee and continue our interview with newfound respect for each others, sandwiched by the pretty mummy girls with beautiful eyes downcast.....

1jnic8a,https://i.redd.it/9zrmghdb9vre1.jpeg,Can My Oracle Touch Be Repaired?,"Can my Oracle Touch be repaired? Here is what happened:

I swapped coffee beans this morning: 1.) detaching the conical part of the grinder, 2.) removing the handful of old beans above the grinder itself with my fingers, and then 3.) reattaching and locking the conical part with the new beans inside. I had done this several times, when the before-and-after flavor profiles were quite different. 

I then proceeded with a grind speed of 12, as usual, but soon started hearing this metal grinding sound. I stopped it, detached the conical part, and then saw two loose pieces and a third piece that looked to be lodged in the grinder as shown in the picture. 

I tried to remove the third piece but too forcefully as I didn’t want to break it. It is still there.

I have had my Oracle Touch since July 2022 and use it four to five times a week.

1jni8c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jni8c6/i_walked_into_a_doctors_office_five_years_later_i/,I walked into a doctor's office. Five years later I escaped. Pt 10,"Nichole sliced into the back of my neck with precision. She made quick work of the surgery, but the pain was blinding. I willed my body to stay rigid, only allowing my hands to grip a wad of the sheet beneath me. My fists balled around the fabric so tightly that even with the barrier, my fingernails pressed through and dug into the skin of my palms. I was sweating as if I had been doing sprints. Nichole made no sound other than her steady, even breathing and one hand pressed on my neck, the other cutting into it. I thought I would black out from the searing agony, but before I could she pulled out the small pill-like device, tossed it on the bed in front of my face.
“I’m going to stitch this up and then we have to move. Can you handle that?” she asked, a brisk clip to her voice. I started to nod, and she grabbed my head. “You still can’t move, Liz.”

I said, “Yes. Sorry. Yes, I can handle it. I’m ok.”
I felt the burn and pulling of the needle sewing the wound she had made. It was unpleasant but bearable. Then there was a crinkle of paper, a ripping sound and she placed a bandage over the whole thing. Then a quick beeping started to go off from somewhere deep inside her bag. Her head snapped toward the sound. “That’s them. They know it’s out. We have to go. NOW!” She jumped from the bed, launching herself toward the door to looked through the peephole. She rushed back to me as I was carefully maneuvering myself back into a sitting position on the bed. She snatched my hand and heaved me onto my feet. She threw everything back into her bag, zipped it, and went to open the door. “When I open the door, no matter what is out there, if anything, do not stop. Go to your left, down the stairs at the end, all the way to the ground floor. From there make a right. You will see a maroon minivan. Go to the passenger side and open the door. Get in. Do not look back. Do not ask questions.” Her words came at me like rapid fire. It was difficult to keep track of her words, but I understood.

She opened the door. Nothing greeted us but the sunlight and musty smell of the building. I walked out in front of her, followed her directions. When I made it down the steps, I heard a man’s voice shout from somewhere above me. Nichole was right behind me and shoved me in the back, urging me to keep moving forward. I saw the minivan, ran to the passenger side, yanked open the sliding door and hopped in the seat. Nichole got in the passenger seat, which confused me until I saw a man sitting in the driver’s seat, hands wrapped around the steering wheel and a stricken look on his young face. He could not have been more than 20 years old. I started to ask who the hell this kid was when both doors closed and Nichole shouted at the boy, “GO!”

The minivan did not look like much, but it tore out of that parking lot like it was in the Indie 500. I could not see out of the back windows since they had all been covered. I could only see the road stretching out ahead of us. Buildings, stores, houses, trees, and fields emerged on the horizon on either side and disappeared as we passed. We barreled down the road for over an hour before any of us could find the courage to speak. The driver glanced over to Nichole, then, using the rear-view mirror, at me, then dutifully back to the road. “Do you think we put enough distance between us now, Nikki?” he asked with a voice just as childlike as his face. You could see he was stressed almost to his breaking point. Nichole responded without looking at him. She simply said, “No.” The two in front must have known where they were going because there was no GPS in sight, and no one was giving or asking for directions. Left turn down a side road, right turn by an old barn. We spent hours moving through back streets and emerging back onto highways, then back off again. No one turned on the radio. No one spoke after Nichole’s reply. The engine, the passing cars, and the tires on the road were all I could hear. I sat, stiff, in the seat, my stomach doing backflips and my heart drumming in my chest. Each time I felt the adrenaline wane even slightly, Nichole would look out the window, or there would be a siren, a car honking, and it would spike, redoubling my anxious state. The sun set and then rose again and still we drove.

At some point, my body must have given out. I woke up abruptly – having no memory of falling asleep or even getting tired. The slow crunch of gravel was like an alarm. I reached to rub my sore neck, forgetting about the stitches. As the pressure of my hand fell upon it, I winced and pulled my hand away quickly. Blood had soaked through the bandage. I wiped my hand clean with the hem of my shirt.

The sky was smoldering behind the orange glow of the sun just visible on the horizon. There were green rolling hills in the distance, and a small and abandoned looking house just ahead. The faded blue paint on its exterior was cracked and peeling. The white front porch spanned the width of the house’s front, the front steps in alignment with the front door. The yard was lush and overgrown. A patch of sunflowers was collapsing in upon itself to the right of the porch. Irises and daffodils were dotted throughout the yard. The whole place felt lonely yet friendly, like a childhood home that sat waiting for you to come back to it. The boy put the minivan in park. His hands were shaking badly as he dried the sweat from his palms onto the legs of his jeans. We both looked to Nichole for some sign of direction. She was still for another minute or so, listening, waiting, watching. Then she took a deep breath and opened the car door. She motioned for the boy to do the same but told me to wait. They walked to the front door of the house. Nichole took out a key, unlocked the door, and walked inside, closely followed by the boy.

They were inside for a few minutes while I waited on pins and needles to know our next move. I was an exposed nerve, growing more restless and fretful as I watched the open doorway until Nichole came back out. She stood on the top porch step and waved for me to join her. My legs ached as I got out of the van and walked awkwardly inside the house. She did not wait for me. She disappeared into one of the rooms as I entered. The boy was nowhere in sight. They both must have felt safe enough here to leave me unattended. I felt exposed. The front door was still hanging wide open, so I closed it and turned the lock, hearing the moderately comforting click of the bolt securing into place.

I wandered around the house giving myself the tour no one else felt was necessary. It was fully furnished. I expected it to look as forsaken on the inside as it did on the outside, but it wasn’t. The living room was warm and bright. There was a soft, plush gray couch along one wall, a scratched yet spotless coffee table in front of it. There were pictures hung on the walls, a bookshelf in the corner, and a coat rack near the front door.

Nothing was dusty. It smelled clean and fresh. The next room was a kitchen, just as immaculate as the living room. A hall opened to the left and there were two doors on the left and one on the right. On the far-right wall of the kitchen was another door. It opened onto a set of stairs leading down into a finished basement that someone had converted into a mother-in-law suite, complete with kitchenette and bathroom. I walked back upstairs, feeling queasy. It could have been nerves, hunger, or the imperceptible strangeness of this place.

All of the furniture looked to have been pulled straight from the early 1990s. Some walls were adorned with faded and out-of-style floral wallpaper, others had wood paneling. It was as if walking through the entry of that house sent you back in time. While the exterior aged with the world beyond, the inside stood as a perfectly preserved monument. It was cozy, even charming, but the contrast of its exterior made me ill at ease.
 
Where am I?  

I was eager for more information, but I had yet to press for any. We had been quiet for so long, it felt as if talking would be unlucky somehow.
I had gotten so used to the quiet, that the sound of the front door felt like a cannon blast in my ears. I held my breath as I rushed back down the hall, searching for Nichole. She materialized from the dark end of the hall, held a finger to her lips, and whispered, “The chimera found us.”

1jni68p,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jni68p/i_walked_into_a_doctors_office_five_years_later_i/,I walked into a doctor's office. Five years later I escaped. Pt 9,"Nichole sliced into the back of my neck with precision. She made quick work of the surgery, but the pain was blinding. I willed my body to stay rigid, only allowing my hands to grip a wad of the sheet beneath me. My fists balled around the fabric so tightly that even with the barrier, my fingernails pressed through and dug into the skin of my palms. I was sweating as if I had been doing sprints. Nichole made no sound other than her steady, even breathing and one hand pressed on my neck, the other cutting into it. I thought I would black out from the searing agony, but before I could she pulled out the small pill-like device, tossed it on the bed in front of my face.
“I’m going to stitch this up and then we have to move. Can you handle that?” she asked, a brisk clip to her voice. I started to nod, and she grabbed my head. “You still can’t move, Liz.”

I said, “Yes. Sorry. Yes, I can handle it. I’m ok.”
I felt the burn and pulling of the needle sewing the wound she had made. It was unpleasant but bearable. Then there was a crinkle of paper, a ripping sound and she placed a bandage over the whole thing. Then a quick beeping started to go off from somewhere deep inside her bag. Her head snapped toward the sound. “That’s them. They know it’s out. We have to go. NOW!” She jumped from the bed, launching herself toward the door to looked through the peephole. She rushed back to me as I was carefully maneuvering myself back into a sitting position on the bed. She snatched my hand and heaved me onto my feet. She threw everything back into her bag, zipped it, and went to open the door. “When I open the door, no matter what is out there, if anything, do not stop. Go to your left, down the stairs at the end, all the way to the ground floor. From there make a right. You will see a maroon minivan. Go to the passenger side and open the door. Get in. Do not look back. Do not ask questions.” Her words came at me like rapid fire. It was difficult to keep track of her words, but I understood.

She opened the door. Nothing greeted us but the sunlight and musty smell of the building. I walked out in front of her, followed her directions. When I made it down the steps, I heard a man’s voice shout from somewhere above me. Nichole was right behind me and shoved me in the back, urging me to keep moving forward. I saw the minivan, ran to the passenger side, yanked open the sliding door and hopped in the seat. Nichole got in the passenger seat, which confused me until I saw a man sitting in the driver’s seat, hands wrapped around the steering wheel and a stricken look on his young face. He could not have been more than 20 years old. I started to ask who the hell this kid was when both doors closed and Nichole shouted at the boy, “GO!”

The minivan did not look like much, but it tore out of that parking lot like it was in the Indie 500. I could not see out of the back windows since they had all been covered. I could only see the road stretching out ahead of us. Buildings, stores, houses, trees, and fields emerged on the horizon on either side and disappeared as we passed. We barreled down the road for over an hour before any of us could find the courage to speak. The driver glanced over to Nichole, then, using the rear-view mirror, at me, then dutifully back to the road. “Do you think we put enough distance between us now, Nikki?” he asked with a voice just as childlike as his face. You could see he was stressed almost to his breaking point. Nichole responded without looking at him. She simply said, “No.” The two in front must have known where they were going because there was no GPS in sight, and no one was giving or asking for directions. Left turn down a side road, right turn by an old barn. We spent hours moving through back streets and emerging back onto highways, then back off again. No one turned on the radio. No one spoke after Nichole’s reply. The engine, the passing cars, and the tires on the road were all I could hear. I sat, stiff, in the seat, my stomach doing backflips and my heart drumming in my chest. Each time I felt the adrenaline wane even slightly, Nichole would look out the window, or there would be a siren, a car honking, and it would spike, redoubling my anxious state. The sun set and then rose again and still we drove.

At some point, my body must have given out. I woke up abruptly – having no memory of falling asleep or even getting tired. The slow crunch of gravel was like an alarm. I reached to rub my sore neck, forgetting about the stitches. As the pressure of my hand fell upon it, I winced and pulled my hand away quickly. Blood had soaked through the bandage. I wiped my hand clean with the hem of my shirt.

The sky was smoldering behind the orange glow of the sun just visible on the horizon. There were green rolling hills in the distance, and a small and abandoned looking house just ahead. The faded blue paint on its exterior was cracked and peeling. The white front porch spanned the width of the house’s front, the front steps in alignment with the front door. The yard was lush and overgrown. A patch of sunflowers was collapsing in upon itself to the right of the porch. Irises and daffodils were dotted throughout the yard.

1jni4b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nomads_Nation/comments/1jni4b0/bellroy_transit_pack_28l_first_version/,Bellroy Transit Pack 28l first version,"I got this backpack at the end of Summer ‘24. I already had the Transit Pack 20l but I needed something with more capacity for my EDC.

I am a dad and I work in IT. So my regular EDC will contain:  
\- my personal laptop (14 inch Dell)  
\- my work laptop (13 inch Dell)  
\- my IPad Air in a case with an incorporated keyboard  
\- my kid’s iPad mini in a thick shockproof case  
\-Alpaka case mini with power cords, power banks, mouse, mouse pad and other small tech tools  
\-Aer Split kit (boo boo kit)  
\-Evergoods 0.5 CAP with snacks inside  
\-Hydroflask 18 or 20 ox with coffee  
\-AirPods  
\-Phones  
\-Wallet  
\-Tiny tech pouch for keyfobs and gum  
\-Hero clip small

Using the pack has been an awesome experience. However here are so Pros and Cons:

Pros:  
\-Clamshell opening. I get to see everything I pack every day.  
\-Clean look. I look my age and not like a high school kid.  
\-Premium materials.

Cons  
\-I put it to the test with light rain. That’s a no no for this pack.  
\-I keep forgetting my hydroflask every time in the pack. In conceals it way too well.

I hear from the community that this pack gives a lot of pain with the straps.  
I really do not walk really long distances with it hence I never had issues with the straps.

I have this pack in my rotation and I am always waiting for a week without rain to use it.

Funny anecdote:

I was entering a hospital one day and they had check my backpack. The guard check everything and told me he has never seen a such organized backpack. I proudly said “yes I am a little bit of a backpack nerd”.

I will take a one day trip for a comedy show soon and I just packed it for my first trip. adding some pictures.

I'm watching gilmore girls for the first time ever and I'm on season 2 ep 13. I really liked season 1, but I've noticed that season 2 is just FILLED with fights. Every episode has at least one and I'm really sick of it. (Max is mad at Lorelai, Lorelai is mad at Rory, Mrs Gilmore is mad at her husband, Dean is mad at Jess, blah blah blah) It's especially frustrating because most of these conflicts could be solved if these people just talked to each other. I was wondering if this goes on for the entire show or not? I thought gilmore girls was just a cozy show about a girl drinking coffee and trying to get into Harvard?? But now the plot is just meaningless fights that are never mentioned again and it's honestly just stressing me out. I'm not used to watching this type of show so maybe that's why I'm so annoyed lol.

1jni26j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jni26j/sentinel_part_15/,Sentinel: Part 15.,"The morning creeps in slow, stretching long shadows across the clearing as the sun pushes its way over the horizon. The sky is that early-morning mix of soft blues and warm golds, still holding onto a bit of the night’s darkness at the edges. The air is crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and the faint hint of pine from the forest beyond. A thin layer of frost coats the ground, sparkling where the sunlight catches it, but already beginning to melt in the warmth of the rising day.

I consult my internal clock. Sunday March 30, 2025. 6:47 AM.

Connor is late.

Not by much—just a few minutes. But enough that I notice. His routine is almost predictable by now. He arrives at the same time every morning, toolbox in hand, some half-muttered complaint on his lips about the cold, or the dirt, or how much work still needs to be done. But right now, the clearing is quiet.

Vanguard shifts beside me, their frame settling deeper into the earth. “Where is he?”

Titan hums lowly, a vibration more than a sound. “Maybe he overslept.”

Vanguard scoffs. “Doubt it. Guy works like a damn machine.”

I process this. Connor does operate with an efficiency that rivals even us. Always moving, always fixing, always working on something. If he isn’t here yet, something must have delayed him.

Then—footsteps.

They crunch against the frost-bitten dirt, steady but unhurried. A moment later, Connor steps into the clearing, rubbing his hands together for warmth. His jacket is zipped up tight against the morning cold, his breath visible in the air. His toolbox is slung over one shoulder, and there’s a cup of coffee in his other hand.

Vanguard makes a sound that’s almost a laugh. “Well, that explains the delay.”

Connor raises an eyebrow, taking a sip of his coffee. “Yeah, yeah. Had to grab some fuel before dealing with you lot.”

Titan tilts their turret slightly. “You’re unusually late.”

Connor huffs, setting his toolbox down with a thud. “By six minutes.”

“Seven now,” I correct, consulting my clock. 6:54 AM.

He gives me a flat look. “You keeping track of my schedule now?”

“Yes.”

Vanguard snickers.

Connor sighs, shaking his head, but there’s a small smirk on his lips. “Alright, whatever. Let’s get to work.”

He crouches beside Vanguard first, running a hand over the damaged plating near their turret. His fingers trace the edges of the reinforced welds he patched up a few days ago, checking for weaknesses.

“Armor’s holding up,” he mutters to himself. “Good. Treads still giving you trouble?”

Vanguard hums. “A little. Right side drags sometimes.”

Connor nods, setting his coffee down before grabbing a wrench from his toolbox. “Yeah, figured. You took some serious hits—tread alignment’s probably still off.”

He gets to work, loosening bolts, adjusting the metal plates, making precise movements that send sharp clicks through the air. The sun rises higher, casting long beams of light between the trees. The frost begins to disappear, replaced by damp patches of earth where the warmth touches.

7:23 AM.

Connor moves on to Titan next. Their armor has held up better than Vanguard’s, but there are still places that need reinforcement. He kneels beside their frame, pressing against one of the plates. It shifts slightly.

“Yeah, that’s not good,” he mutters.

Titan hums. “It was worse before you fixed it.”

“Still needs more welding,” Connor replies, reaching for his welding torch. “Last thing I need is you falling apart mid-conversation.”

He sparks the torch to life, bright white-blue light flashing as he reinforces the metal. The scent of heated steel fills the air, sharp and metallic. Sparks dance across the ground, vanishing as quickly as they appear.

Vanguard watches, their engine humming low. “You ever think about how weird this is?”

Connor doesn’t look up. “What part?”

“You. Us. This whole situation.”

Connor snorts. “Yeah, constantly.”

“But you stick around anyway.”

“Guess I’m just a glutton for punishment.”

Titan hums. “Or maybe you actually care.”

Connor doesn’t respond immediately. He finishes the weld, switching off the torch and leaning back on his heels. “Maybe,” he says finally, voice softer.

I process this. It’s a rare thing, hearing him admit something like that.

8:02 AM. Connor stands, stretching his arms over his head. “Alright, Sentinel. You’re up.”

I track his movements as he approaches, toolbox in hand. He inspects my left tread first, fingers pressing against the bolts he tightened yesterday.

“Still feeling solid?” he asks.

I scan my systems. “Yes.”

He nods, moving up to check the turret joints. His hands are steady, methodical, adjusting anything that feels off. “Your rotation’s a little sluggish. Probably some dust buildup in the servos.”

Vanguard hums. “Told you he doesn’t like things being broken.”

Connor shoots them a look but doesn’t argue. He pulls a rag from his toolbox, wiping away the dirt that’s settled into the smaller crevices of my frame. 9:15 AM. The morning is slipping away. The sky is bright now, the last of the early chill fading under the warmth of the sun. Birds call from somewhere in the trees, their songs drifting lazily through the clearing.

Connor sits back, exhaling. “Alright. That’s most of the major stuff done.”

Vanguard tilts their turret. “You sound almost disappointed.”

He snorts. “Yeah, I just love spending my entire day covered in grease and dirt.”

Titan hums. “You’ve done worse jobs.”

“That’s not saying much.”

Vanguard shifts slightly, their frame settling into the earth. “So, what now?”

Connor wipes his hands on his jacket. “Now? We keep going. Same as always.”

There’s a pause. Not uncomfortable. Just quiet.

I track the time. 10:03 AM. Connor leans back, looking up at the sky. “Y’know,” he says, voice thoughtful, “you guys ever think about what comes next?”

Vanguard hums. “We’ve had this conversation before.”

“Yeah, I know. But… I mean it. What happens when there’s nothing left to fix?”

Titan is silent for a moment, then says, “We keep going. Same as always.”

Connor huffs a quiet laugh. “Yeah. Guess so.”

The day stretches on, warm and steady. The sounds of the forest fill the space between us.

And for the first time, the future doesn’t seem so uncertain.",2,1743356916.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Lyrics:

Oh
I would cut a bitch in two
If she put her hands on you
Better know I'd fuck her up
It's the things I'd do for love

Yesterday ran into your ex
Wants you back, so I broke her neck
Dumb bitch tried to get in your bed
Threw the rope right around her head
Caught your eyes lookin at someone else
Strangled her dead with a studded belt
No nobody loves you the way I do
I'm the angel here to protect you

Oh
I would cut a bitch in two
If she put her hands on you
Bettеr know I'd fuck her up
It's the things I'd do for love
Oh
I just sharpеned all my knives
Got a screw loose in my mind
Not afraid to play it rough
It's the things I'd do for love

We're on a date at the coffee shop
I carved my name in your favorite spot
That new barista she looked too long
So I'll dig a big hole in my backyard
My backyard's a graveyard
I got bones and jars of hearts
She can run, won't get far
Put a tracker in your car

I'm sorry that now you don't have anyone left
I know that you miss them, baby it's for the best
I knew that you needed me the moment we met
But if you find somebody new

Know that I'll protect you
I can keep the girls away
Don't mean to upset you
But your new girlfriend's dead

Oh
I would cut a bitch in two
If she put her hands on you
Better know I'd fuck her up
It's the things I'd do for love
Oh
I just sharpened all my knives
Got a screw loose in my mind
Not afraid to play it rough
It's the things I'd do for love

The things I'd do for love

Hey, slowly putting my living room together.

To preface, the coffee table came much lighter than I thought it would and doesn’t match that well with the console. Originally I was going to get a light brown leather chair but am now wondering if a black lounge would work. 

Option 1) get a light brown chair and keep the table 

Option 2) replace the table with one that matches the console a bit more, and get a black lounge chair 

Option 3) keep table and get a black lounge chair

My problem is I don’t really know how to approach people and start a conversation. I have never really had to do that, people usually found me. 

If I feel comfortable, I can make small talk, but my problem is that I don’t know how to  approach people to even get to the small talk. And also, big groups scare me lol.

I work in an open-space office, and people usually talk the whole day, but I am in the half of the office where there are not a lot of people, and they don’t talk. So I feel like I can’t speak to them that way.
Then there are coffee breaks. A few of them go every day around noon to the coffee break, but they never invite anyone, they just go one by one. I feel like they have a group chat or something. 
Then the other group also does coffee breaks  in the office conference room on the safe floor. I could probably join them, but they are mostly men and older than me by a few years, so I feel kind of intimidated to just go join them. I don’t know if I would have something to talk to them.

There is also a lunch break, but the kitchen is small, and there are a lot of us. I would feel too on the spot with all the other people having a group. 

I just want to know what someone who loves to hang out with people would do. How would they act and make situations for themselves where people would talk to them? I don’t want to force myself on someone or seem desperate.",1,1743356675.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

Hello, cipher slueths.  I've been wracking my brain for the past 2 minutes geolocating Elon Musk's starlink satellites to Jim Sanborn's receding hairline follicle count, and correlating this to the number of buttons on his remote control (of which he presumably uses to watch psychopathic thrillers, indicative of his overall bent).  Thus far I have arrived at a novel solution that would hoodwink even the most self-absorbed ivy league brainiac:

Through the use of sophisticated ai techniques and the renting of the CERN particle accelerator (Berlin Clock reference to the Higgs-Boson), I have uncovered the 30-year old mystery using simply CSS.  Yes, the go-to design language for the absolute NOOBIEST of noobs has uncovered the greatest secret turning otherwise normal human beings into raging Pavlovian dogs since Jim Sanborn was paid $200k to ""spruce up"" the otherwise incredulously boring landscape at Langley.

Before I divulge my statistically relevant solution, I must start with a single caveat:  Any solution will instantly be met with an official statement from the CIA or NSA claiming a young intern solved Kryptos K4 on their coffee break.  Thus, I must conceal my true identity as I would not be able to handle the subsequent media attention and instant stardom.

Solution:

I was dreading it all week knowing how easy it would be to snack and over eat on all sorts of unhealthy foods. But, I didn’t eat a thing ! Feeling really proud of my will power as previously i would have eaten the spares / extra food accidentally made that gets given to staff. Plus, I didn’t really feel the urge too either.

I used a few methods to help stop the snacking : 

• Bought my breakfast to eat at work to keep up satiety longer on shift
• Big Pepsi max to drink ( not great but keeps a “ full feeling “ ) 
• Chewing gum 
• On plan snacks and dinner bought in 
 •Coffee throughout ",7,1743356367.0,CICO,0,1.0,False

I just added things to my mom's table at farmers markets. Eventually she moved on to a different business so I never really learned how to ""do art sales"". I want to try to get back into selling art-- but I'm not looking to build a side business, I just want to scratch that itch and also have an outlet for the pieces I make (honestly I don't want to fill my house with my own work). I also think it would help move my art practice forward, I feel a bit stuck. But I don't have time to set up anything complicated. I think selling through a coffee shop would be ideal. In your experience though, how much hassle is this? Is there a ton of back and forth with the coffee shop people, is it now formalized and you have to have a business license, etc. etc? In general, are the coffee shop owners squeaky wheels-- flaky or needy or nitpicky? I'm in Seattle, if that helps.

I'm heading to Sienna (from Canada) this summer with my university, and I wanted to learn more about local customs or broad Italian customs to make sure I don't commit any *faux pas* while there (like ordering a cappuccino after 11am -- I don't even like coffee, so I should be safe). I'm interested in all kinds of advice, but here are a few questions I'm especially curious about:

* We often ask ""how are you doing"" as a greeting, but I know some places dislike this; is Sienna one of those places?
* Other than in cathedrals or chapels, where I'll definitely cover up, are there unwritten rules about how much skin is appropriate to expose?
* How are tattoos, unnatural hair colours, or alternative styles of hair or dress interpreted?
* Is it generally safe for LGBTQ+ community members to express themselves, or should I keep my vulva-shaped-pomegranate keychain at home?
* Is sexual harassment or catcalling common? Is it considered socially acceptable to talk back or chastise them?
* What are some common signs of wealth that I should avoid (like types of jewelry or brands)? Does that not matter terribly much?
* Any rules about how I should treat elders, service workers, police, or other groups that I should know about, outside of respectfully?
* Is it considered bad manners to refuse food? I'm lactose sensitive and I know my limits, and sometimes I'll have to say ""no"" or else I'll end up in a lot of pain. Is there a good way to refuse or some kind of compromise? (Besides taking Lactaid; I hope to bring it so I can eat all the cheese I can!)

1jnhqoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/100thupvote/comments/1jnhqoc/how_to_salt_trump_imperalism_plans/,How to salt Trump Imperalism plans,"Folks, let’s talk about the big news of the day: Donald Trump’s brilliant threat to annex Greenland and Canada. Yes, because nothing screams 'stable genius' like declaring war on maple syrup and icebergs. This is the geopolitical equivalent of a raccoon trying to steal the moon—ambitious, adorable, and completely insane.

But don’t worry, because our friends in Canada and Greenland have come up with an absolutely fantastic idea to counteract Trump’s plan. Are you ready for this? They’re handing out millions of passports—just flinging them out like Oprah giving away false smiles: ‘You get a passport! You get a passport! Everyone gets a passport!’ And who are they giving them to? Europeans, liberals, Bernie Sanders fans, Greta Thunberg’s Twitter followers, that guy in Norway who knits sweaters for chickens—basically, anyone who thinks universal healthcare is a good thing and that climate change is real.

Why are they doing this? It’s genius. If Trump succeeds in annexing Greenland and Canada, he doesn’t just get a bunch of frozen tundra and polite people who apologize when you bump into them. No, no, no—he also inherits 600 million ultra-liberal citizens who will immediately vote him out of office faster than you can say ‘covfefe.’ It’s like buying a new Trump Tower, only to discover it’s full of Bernie Sanders supporters in every room, knitting pink hats with 'Make Love not War' buttons all over it

And folks, the election results in this new America will be glorious. The Republicans and Democrats will be sidelined so hard, they’ll look like third-party candidates. Instead, the newly formed 'American Socialdemocratic Party'—or as Trump will probably call it, 'The Radical Left Socialist Woke Mob Party of Doom'—will sweep every election at 70% and counting. Their new agenda? Free healthcare, free college, and free maple syrup for all. And guess what? Bernie Sanders will finally be president! Can you imagine Bernie taking the oath of office? 'I do solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth—because billionaires hate the truth!'

And folks, it doesn’t stop there. Once the liberals take over, they’re going to make some big changes. First, they’ll make German the official language of law—because if there’s one thing Americans love, it’s umlauts and compound words that are 50 and more letters long. Next, French will be the mandatory second language at school, so people can finally use dirty words to but make them sound sweet.

Finally, they’ll vote to enforce mandatory gendering in every sentence. Forget ‘he’ or ‘she’—from now on, it’s gonna be ‘he/she/they/ze/xir/whatever-you-want’ for everyone. And if you don’t comply? Boom—two years in woke jail. Which, let’s be honest, is just a coffee shop in Portland.

Oh, and the fake news crackdown? It’s going to be intense. Fox News? Gone for Folksverhezzung. Twitter trolls? Banned from the Internet for Life. Your uncle on Facebook who posts memes about Hillary Clinton eating babies? Sent to a re-education camp where he’ll be forced to binge-watch TED Talks on intersectionality. And don’t even get me started on the crackdown on hate speech. The only thing you’ll be allowed to hate in this new America is pineapple on pizza—and even that’s a little iffy.

So, there you have it, folks. Trump thinks he’s playing 4D chess, but it turns out he’s just playing Poker with Monopoly cards. Because if he annexes Greenland and Canada, he doesn’t get new territory—he gets a brand-new liberal utopia where Bernie Sanders is president, AOC is vice president, and every American citizen gets a free kombucha starter kit.

So, Mr. Trump, if you’re watching—and let’s be honest, you probably are—please, by all means, go ahead and annex Greenland and Canada. I dare you. Because when you do, the people of this new America are going to make sure you’re not president of it for long. And then you learm what it feels like to be… fired.

The time I spent with him was bliss. He got too close too fast. I should have communicated better but he should have respected boundaries just as much. I know it's not a one way street. Bpd dating another bpd on the opposite side of the spectrum. He came over after I specifically told him I needed space. He's sweet, he bought me flowers, remembered everything I told him. After our first date he ordered my favorite drinks and bought me things even I didn't know I needed. He's thoughtful to say the least. But he said ""I love you"". The three words that terrified me and began the sequence of events. His love was addicting but his pacing was exhausting and terrifying. I blocked him. I told him I didn't want to see him again. 


Months go by... I unblock his Facebook account. I missed him. I unblock him on everything. Few days later he messages me. When we first started talking, I told him I wanted to be a veterinarian for exotic animals. I skimmed through his account and there would be all kinds of animal videos. He would talk about their conditions of living and what to do in case you meet one. At the end of each post there would be a signature. ""-K"" my initial. It's in almost every post about animals. 



Flash forward 6 months. We have been dating for 4 months. His anxious attachment isn't intense as it use to be. If anything spending time with him has been healing. I start getting attached. He has been taking care of me in ways I never thought possible. 


Flash forward another 5 months. I've grown attached to him. I love him with all my heart. He truly makes me feel special. He had a business trip. He has bakeries across the country. He wanted to open up a cafe somewhere with my name on it. (I didn't know at the time) 



I didn't see him for a few weeks ...  I started texting him to make sure he was okay, he's eating well, he's taking care of himself. No response. (We leaned on each other since we gotten close, we kept each other in check to make sure we were taking care of ourselves. Since we gotten close I never felt more confident and secure not only in a relationship but in myself. He's been the best support I've ever had.) 


This goes on for a few days... I must have left him 100 voice messages.... Few more days go by.. I started accusing him of cheating and doing all kinds of things to rationalize his absence.....



He came home after two weeks..... (It turned out he broke his phone and as thoughtful as he may be, he didn't write down my number anywhere.)


I blew up on him..... Started yelling at him... Accusing him of things he didn't do ....


I knew it didn't make sense.....


But I left, I went to my parents house....


It's been 3 months since I checked my phone. I've been in this house for 3 months trying to heal.....



Before I turned off my phone, I changed my relationship status.... I told my friend to pretend to be my boyfriend on Facebook.... 



During those three months.... My ex. He moved on.... He started dating someone I never met before. He still posts about animals on Facebook... The only thing missing is the signature with my initial.... 



I saw a post from three months ago... It was an apology to me saying his phone broke while we was on his trip.... There was also a picture of a coffee shop with my name on it.... The name of the coffee shop was "" 'my name' safe space""......


Now I'm sitting here.... Typing this post hoping he sees this one day.... I'm sorry for pushing you away over and over again..... ",6,1743355987.0,BorderlinePDisorder,1,1.0,False

2 years ago I became friends with this girl who I'll call Coffee. Coffee and I had similar hobbies and interests so we hit it off right away. Things became a little awkward when people started started thinking that we were dating. We tried to ignore them but I couldn't help but start to see her in a different light. We both liked each other but we too awkward to say it. Long story short after some incidents where she continuously proved that she trusted others over me and she got new friends that told her that she was too good for me, we gradually grew apart. 

Then last year, she had a big crushed on this other girl that we'll call Yellow. Yellow had no interest in Coffee as she had a crush on me. You see, I knew that Coffee had a crush but she didn't tell me who her crush was until she realised that Yellow and I had become close. Coffee would constantly complain about how Yellow was nonchalant but with me, Yellow was the most silly and talkative person ever. Coffee didn't ask me directly but she implied that I stay away from Yellow and I complied because deep down, I still had feelings for Coffee. So Coffee ended up forcing Yellow into a relationship that Yellow didn't want. After a few months of back and forth, I convinced Yellow to break up with Coffee because she (Yellow) was hurting her (Coffee) and also because also I still liked Coffee. Coffee was heart broken but eventually moved on. We still tried to push something together but the spark was gone and she still had feeling for Yellow. 

After a while I saw no reason to continue ignoring Yellow so we became friends again. Coffee noticed fast and and asked if we were dating and we both said no because we weren't. Fast forward a few months and Yellow and I are really close, we are posting each other and all that and Coffee is not happy. Yellow ends up telling Coffee that we are in fact dating just to get her (Coffee) off her (Yellow) back. Coffee is not happy so she confronts me and I deny it in a way that leaves room for doubt. (I don't know why I did that but I had a feeling about Yellow's plan to lie that she had told me nothing about). Well it worked out because Yellow ended up telling me about how she lied and we laugh about it. 

I end up getting caught up in another situation ( that I can post about it if y'all want ) so I don't get to see Yellow a lot. But I do meet Yellow's best friend Blue. Blue and I become friends and she tells me about how she doent want to be friends with Yellow anymore because she is toxic and she is always turning their friends against her(Blue). I support the idea. 

Yellow confesses to me. I am shocked but I turn her down because I'm really starting to like Blue, I don't tell her that though. Right now, things between Blue and I are going well. I don't think that I'll tell her that I like her because of the age gap between us and I really don't have time for a girlfriend. 

But Yellow and Coffee are not happy. I saw Yellow with Coffee's friends the other day and it looks like Yellow and Coffee are gonna get back together. I don't know why but I don't like that thought of that. Don't attack me. Either ways, Coffee is saying that I ruined her relationship with Yellow is saying that I ruined her friendship.

My diet is already limited ad is. Very hard to find what to eat. I'm exhausted and weak from not eating enough and vitamin deficiency.,"Have arfid and sibo (undiagnosed) so eating is a pain. Don't eat 90% of red meat.
Also having histamine intolerance symptoms I think. Finding out what food bothers me or not feels almost impossible. And eating restrictively exacerbates my eating disorders a lot already. I try to eat packaged things and cook as little as possible, and reduced my junk food intake dramatically. I'll be trying to reduce artificial sweeteners and sugar and see what happens.

In the last couple days I was severely depressed and only ate gluten free toast and prosciutto cotto or smoked salmon. At some point I had a little milk chocolate because period cravings shenanigans. I had no symptoms at all. Then I tried an iron supplement (experimenting tolerance) 2 hours after food, ok. In the morning I tried again to see if I could tolerate it on daytime, fucked my stomach with cramps and acid reflux well into the day even after breakfast. I'll be trying lactoferrin. Found out I have absolute iron deficiency. Doctor denies it.

I haven't found many people with both sibo and arfid discussing food at all. Really struggling to find food I don't hate and my body won't hate. 
I'm eating mostly rice, chicken, zucchini/eggplant (cooked), tomato, tuna, salmon, cream cheese, crackers and tea. Sometimes zero calorie protein chocolate yogurts and similar, but maybe those are bad too. It's so inconsistent. No coffee ever.

Sometimes I still lose to the potato chips demon and I have cramps after, starting to think it's not a coincidence. Trying to not buy them at all anymore because if I have problematic junk in the house I'll probably eat it. Really craving chocolate anything and chips for no reason at all lately. Probably the stress from my body collapsing.

I can also fast fine, but when I eat, I suddenly get hungry and it brothers me a lot. I feel very comfortable eating breakfast and fasting until dinner, but it's like my brain gets super stress hungry after dinner. Don't understand this and that's the time I usually eat problem food if I do. Nutrition is really interesting and also really fucking annoying and complicated. Sometimes I'd rather suffer hunger cramps than risk feeling sick from food. Like now. But I'm week as hell and have blurry vision and I'm struggling to even make sense. This post was supposed to be about white toast vs gluten free toast.

From my childhood i was blindfolded “ study hard hard dint thinkaout love blah blah later u get it when u have”
Bit brief about me 
Iam now 25 by the way , software engineer coming from institute of national importance


In college i didnt focus much on dating or love had a good lot frnds, once i landed on job on 2022 and secured a good package i started to search the love of my lyf.Even my friends are not getting time to hangout with me bcz they are busy with gfs

Tried all dating apps for many months and years now ( tinder,bumble,hinge ,happen,arike,aisle inclding a few matrimoney apps too)!! Took premium booster complete waste money  ,few matches , waste of money

To be frank am an average looking guy of height 5,4 .After 6months in banglore i got some advices to join gym build muscles that will make u attractive and can mingle with people at gym . I joined gym worked out for 1.2 years got enough muscles one time just talked with a girl , but her marriage was abt grt fixed later

Iam not saying am very extrovert person or introvert , but i would be friendly too how they open up with me and i dint want to be creepy like hitting on each girl though most of them are couples though

Later i though ok try chaning the gym  , later bigger gym still same scenarioes 

Bought a nyz bike ,wentout trips with strangers through app it was fun, though no friendships lasted to relationships  ,most of them were couples rarely girls used to come for stranger trips , then i thought bcz kf not having an iphone then bought that too, 

Already new piano, started learning guitar on my own , from utube videos now i can handle good amount of chords and strumming neatly


Tried joining more social kind of stuffs went for swimming mostly on weeekends for almost 6 months along with gym still nothing 


Later again changed the gym ,still same
Later stopped the gym and joined a boxing academy atleast there to find someone

See i dont directly want to have sex or not creeply completely into those , if things workout for eachother could think about marriage i dont  have a problem
But cannot even get for a single date, not even a single girl as friend to atleast go out for a coffee

Iam not shy to talk to girls or mess around.Due to some utube videos i gained some confidence i tried twice in banglore mgroad like asking out to stranger girls but it was kind of like had good talk they talked about
their home hobbies etc i too, didnt get insta or whatsapp that works out only in europe i felt 
Those we were mallu girls and iam mallu as well a pure malayali born and brought up in kerala

Y didnt u find love in office?

Its not an mnc by the way ,a mid level startup 150+ employyess most of them married and are way elder than me.Didnt feel it safe to start ine from their nether didn i got a connection or vibe their 
Then y dont u change the company?
I tried but for my sake they retained me withan immediate 120% hike (18Lpa)and for my dumbness i accepted so cant change company for a while
Some aftereffects of outperforming in work
I always used to be problem solver at work,was able to shine in everything work related 


Iam so desperate such that i could give some (10-15k)amount of money(like  a girl to act as my girl friend ) per month

And regarding my grooming , i used to appear with beards like correctly trimmed and maintained , used to use facewashes, vtaminc serums , moisturisers and have tried only those 
Lot of it, most of them daily



I dont know what to do i didnt  feel it was this hard to crack Jee mains nor an high package job


Any advices ?

Iam in BTM banglore, completely broken thinking about shifting city if nothing works out but feels that doesnt change anything niether


Note:( pls dont ask me to join clubs or social activites am fed up of it,philospical craps about love, and quotes like find purpose of life passion etc fed up of those)

My partner has been seeing potential units/ neighborhoods in person this week, but I am not on this trip so wanted to get this subreddit’s thoughts. I’ve been to both neighborhoods last year and liked both but tbh wasn’t paying that much attention/imagining myself living there. Have scanned the subreddit and read posts on SE and Somerville, both neighborhoods seem like a good choice based off what I’m reading. Some more info on us below:

• Couple in our early/mid-30s, no kids.

• Husband be commuting nearly daily to Seaport for work. I will be remote but may commute to Kendall Square.

• Will have one car. Seems like there is street parking w resident permit in the SE unit we’re most interested in. Tenant says it’s not been a problem except on Sundays, but can you all confirm?

•Would like a nice community with local events where we can meet people around our age and build lasting friendships.

•We both love greenery and parks, walking, biking. Somerville seems to have a community biking path but SE seems to also have biking lanes.

•I’m a fan of bookstores, local coffee shops, art classes (ceramics, photography, watercolor, etc.). Husband is into nature, biking, history.

1jnhes7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Totaldrama/comments/1jnhes7/what_if_my_fanmade_character_was_in_tdroti/,What If My Fanmade character was in TDROTI?,"**Name:** Tessa ""Tess"" Holloway

**Age:** 16

**Hometown:** Portland, Oregon

**Life Outside of Total Drama:**  
Tess is an artistically inclined high school junior who spends most of her time sketching in her notebook, painting murals around town, and participating in local art competitions. She’s a bit of a loner but has a small, close-knit group of friends who share her love for alternative music, urban exploration, and thrift shopping. Tess’s parents own a small coffee shop, where she helps out on weekends, making her an expert in caffeine-fueled late-night creativity. Though she comes off as reserved at first, she has a sharp wit and a rebellious streak that occasionally gets her into trouble at school.

**Skills and Abilities:**

* **Creative Thinker:** Tess is great at coming up with unconventional solutions to problems, making her an asset in challenges that require strategy or ingenuity.
* **Agile and Quick:** She’s not the strongest competitor, but her nimbleness helps her excel in physical challenges that require speed and precision.
* **Sharp Social Observer:** While she’s not the most outgoing, Tess is highly perceptive and can read people well, allowing her to predict alliances, betrayals, and hidden motives.
* **Artistic Talent:** Her drawing skills come in handy when it comes to designing team flags, disguises, or visual-based tasks in the competition.

**Strategy for the Game:**  
Tess plans to play the game under the radar for as long as possible. She’ll align herself with stronger players early on, using them as shields while she gathers information and subtly influences decisions. She prefers to avoid direct confrontation but won’t hesitate to make sneaky moves when necessary. If she makes it to the merge, she’ll shift gears, forming a tight alliance with a few trustworthy players and subtly steering votes without making herself a target. Tess doesn’t need to be the loudest or the most dominant—she just needs to be the one pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

Her biggest weakness? She struggles with overly physical challenges and doesn’t do well in social situations where she’s forced to be fake. If the game forces her to betray someone she genuinely likes, she might hesitate—and hesitation could cost her everything.",0,1743355187.0,Totaldrama,1,0.5,False

1jnhcqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1jnhcqz/who_else_just_had_surgery/,Who else just had surgery?,"I had my first BC surgery last week and I thought it might be helpful to compare notes with others who also had surgery last week, for solidarity. Anyone? I'll go first:

On Wednesday (3/26) I had a left-side SMX with SLNB and expander, and a right-side reduction. It went pretty well. Surgery was uneventful, I didn't have any serious anesthesia side effects, and I'm healing ok so far. For background, I have Stage II grade 2 IDC ER+ PR+ HER2- and did neoadjuvant TCx4 December-February after an October DX. One tumor, left breast, about 3cm before chemo and no sign of lymph spread. 

I have two drains on the left, output is down to about 50ml/day combined. I'm taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and gabapentin, and have some oxycodone pills I haven't needed. The whole breast area on both sides is kind of strange and alien, with a combination of numbness and pain.

The pain and discomfort that broke through the painkillers has evolved. At first the worst of it was the expanders near the breastbone where they currently are bulging through the skin—I was told that is where they had to do some extra stapling to hold the expanders in place, so I guess that's a good thing, and that's not bothering my anymore. I've also had some sense of swelling and tenderness, especially in the healthy breast, as well as in the areas of the cancer breast that aren't completely numb. I am taking pain on the left side a good thing meaning that I may still keep some sensation there, although some parts of it are completely numb, especially over the area where the tumor was. I also have an annoying area on my left side where my drains come out, right near the primary mastectomy incision, is also where the bra band tries to rest, and is an odd patchwork of numb and tender skin. I'm not sure there is anything to make that better until the drains are removed.

I've been sleeping in bed with a stiff wedge that keeps me at a semi-incline and not rolling around and that seems to work although I already miss being able to roll onto my side.

I haven't started doing significant activity yet but try to walk around my home and do some leg motions. I might start short walks tomorrow. I also am able to use a laptop and mouse and will probably start working a few hours a day beginning tomorrow. But if I were on medical leave from a full-time job I would not be going back to work next week at all.

My adult daughter is staying with me and with her help I haven't had too much trouble with daily tasks. I had no problem being alone for chemo but it would be pretty tough to do this without a helper! I'm making mental notes though, in case I can't always have someone stay long for every surgery, since I will have at least one more. Already some things that were difficult a few days ago are getting easy to do on my own, like getting into bed, and opening pill bottles. I made my own coffee this morning and just had to be careful carrying the water.

My current worries/concerns (other than waiting for pathology):

* They said I'm supposed to have my first PS follow-up on Tuesday and would call to schedule but no one did so now I have to chase that down tomorrow and maybe wait longer.
* My medical notes say they took FIVE lymph nodes, I was sure hoping for less than that. Have yet to discuss it with the SO.
* No one has advised me yet on compression garments of any kind, only to wear a supportive front-close sports bra. 
* On my reduced breast, mostly I have full sensation including the incision around the nipple but the nipple itself feels numb and I am hoping that is temporary.
* Otherwise, trying not to overthink anything about how things look or feel while I'm still healing AND haven't had my swap surgery yet. But body image thoughts keep creeping in. I am hopefully getting a DIEP eventually but don't know yet how long I have to wait, and without that I have lost so much breast tissue but still have my menopause belly and the combination is just bizarre. I think my belly is bigger than my bustline right now, even if I had my full left breast! I haven't had those proportions since I was five years old.

Would love to hear from others who are in a similar place right now. How is it going for you?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/healthinspector/comments/1jiv7e7/compromises\_possible\_or\_just\_get\_up\_to\_code/](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthinspector/comments/1jiv7e7/compromises_possible_or_just_get_up_to_code/)

where our local HD is not allowing us to serve hot tea samples at farmer's markets and craft fairs without a NSF powered hand sink. I was really nervous to post but was so shocked by how clear and helpful you guys were, thank you so much!! To confirm, we did explore as many options as we could including plan review, asking for gravity sink/foot pedal sink instead, asking for explanations on the risk etc. and have still been turned down.  

So because there is no exemption for coffee or tea in our state, and our type of permit (annual itinerant for farmer's markets) requires powered NSF hand sinks for ALL open food/bev, that's still what we need to bring to market to brew hot tea.

Luckily something else opened up, which is that a new bill is going through state legislature this month on cottage food + sink regulations!! There's no commentary on coffee or tea yet though, so I was wondering if I could get your help on proposing regulations that would be sensible in your opinion?

For example, what would you do in your jurisdiction for our case? Any thoughts/comments/nuances to consider? And if possible, could you share which general jurisdiction (state) and position you have, so that they can't just tell me I'm making things up lol.

If there's another way to go about this that you'd suggest too, let me know.

The first sign was the birds. They started falling from the sky at exactly 3:33 p.m., not dead—just… folded wrong. Inside out, almost, with feathers where eyes should be. Nobody screamed. Not at first. People just stood still, necks tilted back, watching the soft rain of malformed sparrows tumble down like ash.
James was the only one who didn’t look up. He was busy reading the name carved into his arm. It hadn’t been there yesterday. And it wasn’t his name.
Orry.
It curled along his skin in deep red grooves, healed but angry, like it had been there for years. Each letter shimmered faintly in the sun, like something beneath his skin was trying to blink.	
	Across the street, a child was pulling teeth from a dandelion. Long human molars, still warm, blooming out of the yellow fluff like seeds. She didn’t seem upset—just bored. Every time she plucked one, a new one grew in its place. A man passed by her and casually tossed a penny into her lap, as if she were doing something normal. Like busking.
	James blinked. His mouth was dry. The buildings were too tall. They leaned in. A bus rolled by, empty but loud, its wheels grinding like they were chewing.
	“Hey,” said a voice behind him.
	James turned. The man wore a milkman’s uniform—white, crisp, wrong for the decade—and no eyes. Just stitched lids with mascara leaking from the seams. He held out a small glass bottle filled with something thick and dark.
	“It’s your turn,” the milkman said, shaking it. “You can’t keep skipping days.”
	James took it without meaning to. His fingers were trembling. The bottle was warm.
	From somewhere above them, a church bell rang, slow and wet. It sounded like meat slapping tile. Nobody else heard it.
James didn’t remember unscrewing the cap, but the bottle was open. The liquid inside moved like ink in reverse—pulling light into itself instead of reflecting it. It smelled like burnt rosemary and pencil lead.
	“Bottoms up,” the milkman said. His stitched eyes twitched.
	James tipped the bottle toward his lips but stopped when the sun blinked.
	Not behind a cloud.
	The sun itself blinked. Once. Slowly.
	He dropped the bottle. It didn’t shatter. It breathed. A slow, glassy exhale as it melted into the sidewalk, leaving behind a ring of frost and a single eyelash.
	The milkman was gone.
	In his place stood a payphone with the receiver swinging. It rang once—just once—but the sound came from inside James’s chest. It rattled in his ribs.
	He ran.
	Down alleys that stretched too long. Past storefronts that all had the same display: A clock, bleeding from its numbers. The digits oozed down the glass like syrup, congealing into words he couldn’t read.
	The ground was soft. Like bread. It gave slightly underfoot, like the whole city had been baked too long ago to still be fresh.
	He stopped at a mirror nailed to a tree—because of course now there were trees—and looked into it.
	The reflection wasn’t him.
	It was a man with no mouth, wearing James’s clothes, holding a bouquet of snakes. They hissed in harmony, forming one word: Orry.
	The trees began whispering names he almost remembered—lovers he’d never kissed, funerals he hadn’t attended. The ground cracked. The roots beneath pulsed like veins.
	James stumbled backward and fell into a puddle that hadn’t been there before. The water was deep, bottomless. Falling felt like drowning, but wetter. Colder.
James landed on a carpet of static. Not a sound—actual static. The floor fuzzed and rippled under his palms like old television snow. He looked up and saw nothing but frames—hanging midair. Empty picture frames, all sizes, all spinning slowly.
	Inside some of them, there were moments. Little clips. James as a child, sobbing in a field of headless dolls. James older, feeding something that looked like a goat but blinked horizontally. James asleep in a hospital bed, surrounded by people he didn’t recognize, all facing away from him.
	In one frame, he was standing in front of a door. Rusted, pitted, too narrow to be real. It pulsed gently. Like it was breathing.
	He looked away from the frame and the door was in front of him.
	It hadn’t opened. But the key was in his hand. He hadn’t picked it up. It was made of glass, and a single vein ran through it—pulsing.
	He knew what would happen if he opened it.
	He knew what wouldn’t.
	A voice—no, his voice—spoke behind him. “This is where you stopped before. Don’t pretend you forgot.”
	James didn’t turn around.
	He put the key in the lock.
The door smiled. Literally. Dozens of human teeth lined the edge like bristles. It groaned open.
	Inside was not a room.
	Inside was a chair. One single chair in a white void, and Orry was sitting in it.
	Except… Orry was James. Or James was Orry. Or neither. The body wore his skin, but wrong—loose in some places, too tight in others. The face twitched between familiarity and distortion, like it couldn’t decide which version of him to be.
	“You're early,” Orry-James said. “Or late. It's always hard to tell when the birds fall too fast.”
	James opened his mouth to speak but instead screamed—not from his throat, but from his hands. His fingers parted, and his palm split open like a mouth, releasing a sound only dogs could understand.
	The lights above them (where had the ceiling come from?) began to flicker Morse code in blood.
	Orry stood. “Do you want to wake up now?”
	James nodded.
	Orry shook his head. “Then don’t open the door again.”
James’s eyes shot open.
	He was in bed. Sheets damp with sweat. Fan whirring. The soft, choking hum of early morning light coming through the blinds. His heart was hammering, but the world was still.
	No malformed birds. No melting bottles. No Orry.
	Just… morning.
	He stared at the ceiling, trying to shake the taste of static from his mouth. His alarm clock blinked red in the corner.
	3:33 a.m.
	As he sat up, the corner of his blanket fell back—and he saw the name.
	Faint. Faded. But there.
	Orry. Etched on his forearm. Like old scar tissue that had been waiting to be noticed.
	James stumbled to the bathroom. Splashed water on his face. Didn’t look up at the mirror at first. Didn’t want to.	
	But he did.
	And the reflection was fine. Normal. Tired eyes. Dry lips. No bouquet of snakes.
	Then the mirror blinked. Just once.
	He didn’t.
	The clock in the hall chimed from nowhere—once, twice, three times. The sound was wet. Like bones breaking under pressure.
	He walked to the kitchen, needing light. Needing coffee. Needing anything real.
	On the counter was a feather.
	Not black. Not white. But the color of nothing—an absence. It shimmered like forgetting. It hadn’t been there last night. It shouldn’t have been there.
	He picked it up.
	Underneath it was a note, written in scorched handwriting:
	“You were Orry before you woke up.
	You’ll be him again soon.”
	Behind him, a door creaked open.
	His bedroom door.
	Except he hadn’t opened it. And from the gap leaked light.
	Not yellow. Not white.
	Static.

I've been working on BrewLog – a platform built to help coffee enthusiasts track their brews, refine their recipes, and dial in the perfect cup over time.

With BrewLog, you can:  
✅ Log every brew – track grind size, brew ratio, water temp, and more  
✅ Access your brews anywhere – your account syncs across devices  
✅ Explore community recipes – see how others brew & get inspired  
✅ Save & share your own recipes – build a personal brew log  
✅ Improve your pour-over game – track what works (and what doesn’t)

  
We are quite new, but constantly improving; with huge updates every week! Last week we introduced community recipes, so you can find new coffee recipes! And we have loads more updates to come!

I just launched a 3-day free trial, so you can try it out with no commitment. Would love to hear feedback!

We ended up hanging out for several hours.  Not sure if we will see each other again, but even if we don’t we both had a really fun evening!

I was recently reading about the concept of ""third spaces"" - those wonderful spots outside of our homes, workplaces, or schools where we can connect with others, exchange ideas, and just generally hang out. Think your favorite coffee shop, that cozy corner in a bar, your book club meeting spot, or even the park where your running group gathers.

The Brookings Institution defines them as ""locations where we exchange ideas, have a good time, and build relationships,"" and they're so important for our well-being!

It got me thinking... **what is YOUR favorite third space in Rhode Island?**

I'm genuinely curious to hear about the places that bring you joy, connection, and a sense of community in our little state. Maybe you've found a hidden gem, a bustling hub, or a quiet sanctuary that serves as your go-to spot.

Tell me:

* **What is it?** (Name of the place, general type of location like ""local bookstore cafe,"" ""brewery,"" ""community garden,"" etc.)
* **Where in Rhode Island is it located?**
* **What makes it your favorite third space?** (Is it the atmosphere, the people, the activities, something else?)

I'm looking for inspiration for new places to check out and I'm sure others are too! Let's share the love for our favorite community hubs.

The brand, *Chicorée au Kurde* (Kurdish Chicory), dates back to 1850 when the fruits of the terebinth tree, referred to as Qazwan in Kurdish, were harvested in Kurdish-majority areas in the Mediterranean and processed into a coffee-like beverage. The product was then exported to France, where it was marketed as *Chicorée au Kurde* and distributed globally by the French company Marcel Godard. Notably, the packaging often featured images of Kurdish soldiers, emphasizing its cultural origins.""

1jnh372,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1jnh372/the_evolution_of_soap_making_traditional_vs/,The Evolution of Soap Making: Traditional vs. Modern Techniques,"Soap is an essential part of daily hygiene, yet few people realize the **rich history and technological advancements** that have shaped the way we clean ourselves today. From ancient civilizations crafting soap from animal fats and ashes to modern factories producing **scientifically formulated, eco-friendly, and specialized soaps**, the journey of soap-making is a **fascinating blend of tradition and innovation**.

In this blog, we will explore:  
✔️ How soap was made in ancient times  
✔️ The science behind traditional and modern techniques  
✔️ How modern soap-making has evolved with technology and sustainability  
✔️ Key differences between handcrafted and mass-produced soaps

**1. The Birth of Soap: Ancient Soap-Making Methods**

**1.1. The Earliest Evidence of Soap (2800 BCE — 600 CE)**

Soap-making dates back over **5,000 years**, with the earliest recorded evidence from the **Babylonians around 2800 BCE**.

🔹 **Babylonian** [**Soap**](https://www.truegether.com/category/health-and-beauty) **(2800 BCE)** — Archaeologists discovered **clay tablets** with recipes combining **wood ash, animal fats, and water** to make a cleaning substance.  
🔹 **Egyptian Soap (1500 BCE)** — The Egyptians mixed **animal oils with alkaline salts** for cleansing and medicinal purposes.  
🔹 **Roman Soap (600 BCE — 476 CE)** — The Romans improved soap-making by adding **herbs, perfumes, and oils**, leading to the development of **soap bars**.

👉 Fun Fact: The word **“soap”** comes from **Mount Sapo in Ancient Rome**, where animal sacrifices resulted in a mixture of **fats and ash** washing down into the river, helping clothes get cleaner!

**1.2. Medieval and Renaissance Soap-Making (600 CE — 1700s)**

During the **Middle Ages**, soap-making became a craft practiced by European guilds.

🔹 **Arab Innovations (7th Century CE)** — The Arabs developed **solid soap bars** using **olive oil and lye**, making them pioneers of **Castile soap** (still popular today).  
🔹 **French & Italian Soaps (15th-17th Century)** — Cities like **Marseille and Venice** became soap-making hubs, using **high-quality olive oils and fragrances**.  
🔹 **England’s Soap Boom (1600s)** — By 1622, King James I of England taxed soap, proving its growing demand.

👉 **By the 18th century**, soap was no longer a luxury for the rich but a household necessity!

**2. Traditional Soap-Making Techniques: The Foundation of Handmade Soap**

**2.1. Cold Process Soap-Making**

🔹 **Ingredients:** Fats/oils + Lye (sodium hydroxide) + Water  
🔹 **Process:**

1. Lye is mixed with water.
2. Oils are melted and combined with the lye solution.
3. The mixture undergoes **saponification**, turning into soap.
4. Essential oils and botanicals are added.
5. The soap is poured into molds and cured for **4–6 weeks**.

✅ **Pros:** Retains natural glycerin, highly moisturizing, customizable.  
❌ **Cons:** Long curing time, handling lye requires caution.

**2.2. Hot Process Soap-Making**

🔹 **Ingredients:** Same as cold process.  
🔹 **Process:** Instead of curing for weeks, the soap is **heated and cooked**, speeding up saponification.

✅ **Pros:** Ready in 24 hours, rustic texture, retains natural oils.  
❌ **Cons:** Less aesthetic appeal, limited design options.

**2.3. Traditional Marseille and Castile Soaps**

🔹 **Marseille Soap:** Made with **72% olive oil**, famous in France for being **pure and hypoallergenic**.  
🔹 **Castile Soap:** Originated in Spain, contains **100% olive oil**, making it one of the most **gentle soaps**.

**3. The Modern Revolution of Soap-Making**

The **Industrial Revolution (1700s-1900s)** transformed soap-making from a handmade craft into a **mass-produced commodity**.

**3.1. The Discovery of Modern Soap Chemistry**

🔹 **1791** — French chemist **Nicolas Leblanc** discovered how to create **sodium carbonate (soda ash)** from common salt, making soap production cheaper.  
🔹 **1823** — **Michel Eugène Chevreul** identified the chemical process of **saponification**, leading to standardized soap formulas.  
🔹 **1879** — Procter & Gamble launched **Ivory Soap**, the first **commercially mass-produced floating soap**!

**3.2. Mass-Produced Soap: How It’s Made Today**

Unlike traditional methods, modern soap-making is **automated and precise**.

🔹 **Main Ingredients:** Synthetic detergents, palm oil, coconut oil, artificial fragrances, preservatives.  
🔹 **Steps in Mass Production:**

1. Fats/oils are heated and mixed with a **continuous-flow process**.
2. Synthetic surfactants and additives are added for **lather and fragrance**.
3. The mixture is vacuum-dried and poured into **molds at scale**.
4. Bars are pressed, stamped, and packaged.

✅ **Pros:** Affordable, consistent quality, long shelf-life.  
❌ **Cons:** Lacks natural glycerin, may contain **harsh chemicals**.

**3.3. Modern Innovations: Natural, Organic, and Sustainable Soaps**

With growing awareness of **harsh detergents and synthetic chemicals**, the soap industry is shifting towards:

✔️ **Organic and Vegan Soaps** — Using **plant-based oils (coconut, shea butter, almond oil)** instead of animal fats.  
✔️ **Eco-Friendly Packaging** — Brands like **Ethique and Lush** offer **plastic-free soaps**.  
✔️ **Waterless Soap Bars** — Reducing carbon footprints and packaging waste.  
✔️ **Biodegradable Soaps** — Popular for camping and eco-conscious consumers.

👉 **Market Growth:** The **organic soap industry** is expected to reach **$383.4 million by 2027**, driven by demand for **natural and chemical-free personal care products**.

**4. Traditional vs. Modern Soap-Making: Key Differences**

**5. The Role of Fragrance and Additives in Soap-Making**

One of the biggest differences between **traditional and modern soap-making** is the use of **fragrances, colors, and additives**. While traditional soaps rely on **natural essential oils and botanical extracts**, modern soaps often incorporate **synthetic fragrances, artificial dyes, and chemical stabilizers**.

**5.1. Natural vs. Synthetic Fragrances**

🔹 **Natural Essential Oils** — Derived from **plants, flowers, and herbs**. Examples:  
✔️ **Lavender oil** (calming, antibacterial)  
✔️ **Tea tree oil** (antimicrobial, acne-fighting)  
✔️ **Eucalyptus oil** (refreshing, decongestant)

🔹 **Synthetic Fragrances** — Chemically formulated to mimic natural scents but often contain **phthalates**, which can cause **skin irritation and allergies**.  
✔️ **Pros:** Long-lasting scent, cost-effective.  
✔️ **Cons:** Can be harsh on sensitive skin.

**5.2. Colorants and Aesthetic Enhancements**

Traditional soaps use **natural clays, herbs, and fruit extracts**, while commercial soaps rely on **FD&C synthetic dyes**.  
✔️ **Natural Colorants:** Activated charcoal (black), turmeric (yellow), spirulina (green).  
✔️ **Synthetic Dyes:** Often petroleum-based and may cause **skin sensitivities**.

👉 **Consumer Trend:** 72% of consumers now prefer **fragrance-free or naturally scented soaps**, leading brands to shift towards essential oil-based formulations.

**6. Specialty Soaps: The Rise of Niche Markets**

With increasing awareness of **skin health, sustainability, and ethical sourcing**, soap-making has diversified into **specialized categories** catering to different needs.

**6.1. Medicinal and Therapeutic Soaps**

✔️ **Antibacterial Soaps:** Infused with **tea tree oil, neem, or triclosan**.  
✔️ **Exfoliating Soaps:** Contain **oatmeal, coffee grounds, or sea salt** to remove dead skin.  
✔️ **Hypoallergenic Soaps:** Made for **sensitive skin** with no artificial additives.

👉 **Interesting Fact:** Overuse of **antibacterial soaps** may contribute to **antibiotic resistance**, leading to the **FDA banning triclosan** in hand soaps in 2016.

**6.2. Vegan & Cruelty-Free Soaps**

✔️ No **animal-derived ingredients** like tallow (beef fat) or lanolin (from sheep wool).  
✔️ Popular brands: **Dr. Bronner’s, Lush, The Body Shop**.  
✔️ Market growth: The **vegan soap industry** is expected to reach **$6.5 billion by 2028**.

**6.3. Luxury and Handmade Artisanal Soaps**

✔️ Infused with **gold dust, caviar, or silk proteins**.  
✔️ Custom, hand-carved, and gift-worthy.  
✔️ Sold at high-end boutiques and wellness spas.

👉 **Did you know?** The world’s most expensive soap, **Qatar’s “Khan Al Saboun,”** is made with **pure gold and diamond powder** and costs **$2,800 per bar**!

**7. Sustainability and the Future of Soap-Making**

With growing concerns about **plastic pollution, toxic chemicals, and water waste**, modern soap-making is shifting towards **eco-friendly and sustainable innovations**.

**7.1. Zero-Waste and Waterless Soaps**

✔️ Solid shampoo & conditioner bars **reduce plastic waste**.  
✔️ **Waterless formulations** (powder-to-foam soaps) use **70% less water** than liquid soaps.

**7.2. Palm Oil-Free Soaps**

✔️ Palm oil is linked to **deforestation and habitat destruction**.  
✔️ Brands like **Ethique and Lush** now offer **palm oil-free alternatives**.

**7.3. Biodegradable and Reef-Safe Soaps**

✔️ Ideal for camping and marine environments.  
✔️ Free from **sulfates and microplastics** that harm aquatic life.

👉 **Eco-Friendly Market Growth:** The demand for **sustainable personal care products** is projected to hit **$20 billion by 2027**.

**Did You Know? (Fun Facts About Soap!)**

🧼 The **world’s most expensive soap** costs **$2,800** and contains **gold flakes and diamond powder**!  
🧼 Soap kills **99.9% of germs** by breaking down their lipid membranes!  
🧼 The global soap industry is worth **$34 billion** and growing!

**Final Thoughts: Which is Better — Traditional or Modern Soap?**

🌿 If you prioritize **natural ingredients, skin benefits, and sustainability**, **traditional handmade soap** is the way to go.  
If you need an **affordable, easily available, and consistent** product, **modern mass-produced soap** is convenient. You can also buy some of the best quality soaps online from [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether.

Either way, **soap-making has come a long way** from the ancient **Babylonians and Romans to the high-tech labs of today**. The evolution continues as new trends in **organic, waterless, and zero-waste soaps** emerge, proving that soap is not just a simple cleaning product but a **reflection of human innovation and sustainability**.

So next time you pick up a bar of soap, take a moment to appreciate its **5,000-year journey!**",1,1743354345.0,u_Kind-Claim-2577,0,1.0,False
1jnh2qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jnh2qt/i_32m_get_anxious_about_my_gfs_24f_lack_of/,I (32M) get anxious about my GFs (24F) lack of reponsiveness in texting and some other issues. What could I do?,"We've been together for 9 months now. It was completely sweet at the beginning, but recently our texting conversations got reaaaaly stale and dry, she won't respond to texts for hours - which would sometimes happen anyway - but now she also stopped telling me nice things, like how she loves me or misses me, or that she's horny for me. Nothing of the sort for at least past two months.  
I get that, it happens in relationships.

But now it gets... worse.

She won't tell me she loves me on her own in person. We usually see each other on Saturdays, last Saturday she told me last minute she is going out drinking with her friends - when I already came back with groceries for our dinner. Did not mention anything like that prior.  
This weekend I asked if she's coming, she said she needs to help her female friend with something. Again, did not mention anything before I asked. Then radio silence whole Saturday, except for one text that today (Sunday) she's seeing her cousin for a coffee. OK. We exchanged few messages today, I texted her I love her and that I want her now. Left me on read for 40 minutes before replying she loves me too.

Last time we saw each other was on Wednesday, we went to the movies, then for a drink and back to my place. We started messing around, but I couldn't perform. Then something broke inside me and I asked her if she's happy with me. She didn't say yes or no, just asked me where's that coming from and then hugged me tight.

I am pulling my hair out and that's bad cause my hair is already thinning.

**Weird thing is, it's completely different when we see each other** \- I can see she's smiling at me, we get a lot of cuddles, as much intimacy as we can get - but still she won't tell me she loves me on her own, also somehow all my attempts to bring back topic of living together get ignored. I can't wrap my head around it and I am considering possibility she's cheating on me, or getting cold feet.

I get that she needs some space - but skipping our weeekend dates two times in a row, and making sure I don't plan anything with her for Sunday, as well as being much, much colder over text is bothering me and making me anxious.

Can someone please make sense of this situation for me?

  
EDIT: for clarity - I am not saying I really suspect she's cheating or something, I just am anxious that this is a possibility, given my prior experiences in previous relationship. ",1,1743354312.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I've been to Cabo a few times but this will probably be our final time at a ""party"" resort so I'd like to make the best of it. Don't necessarily have too much in mind, probably spend 95% of the trip on-resort and choose a single excursion or something similar.

1) is anyone else planning on visiting from April 10 - April 16?


2) anyone have any experience with getting reusable cups filled? Like a leak-proof 40 oz tumbler? Did you see anyone else using something similar? Would the bartending staff find that annoying?

3) I was able to figure out every restaurants location, hours and type of food with the exception of Torote. Between the app, the website, and photos from the actual restaurant entrance providing conflicting information, I can't figure out if Torote is open for both lunch AND dinner in addition to breakfast, and whether its a la carte or buffet for either. I ask because if it's open for lunch and dinner, then it would technically be the only restaurant on the resort that's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Anyone know about that one?


4) Do the main restaurants really close at 10pm or is that when they stop seating people? In various vlogs I saw people still eating dinner at 11pm.


5) Does the sports bar actually serve fresh food and beverages 24 hours a day, or is the 24 hour portion referring to the various foods in the refrigerator that are packaged to go? If that's the case, anyone know when the sports bar is actually staffed?


I think those are my only lingering questions. Thanks in advance! Hope to meet some new friends there.

I have never posted a post. So here goes. I woke up with this thing on my mind, as well as a song that kinda synched things together some more in my personal life. 

Over the last few months I’ve practiced listening more to my body -as well as tested and analyzed 🧐making spontaneous impulsive decisions the old way (which turns out in terms of my human design is WAY incorrect) as opposed to the new bodies way, which was always there guiding me I just wasn’t aware!

When excitement energy flows into my body, I am to wait for the wave to crest onto the shore before decisions can be made. If the energy and excitement are still there after a time, but more gently humming, vibrating as opposed to a power surge blowing circuits 🤣 … then I’m to proceed. 

Also, the solar plexus is the main responder / motor so feeling from the area as spiritual guiding mechanism for benevolent life trajectory and future outcomes.  Coming home. 

Anyway, I have a good friend, who’s also an ex husband. He had an affair during our marriage, the betrayal was karmic-intense because  I recognized some things in me to change through that pain and loss and appreciated the lesson in the end… so I could love him as a friend later on. 

He amended the behavior, apologized and was deeply regretful.  We healed ❤️‍🩹 

So now we go for walks occasionally and I help him with stuff too. Yet feel our giving/ receiving is equalized. I think so anyway. Could be wrong.  I’ve toyed with the idea we might be together under different terms. Build a house together whatever ..However- 

Over the last three times we met for walks or coffee I literally fell down each time. Tripped, slid, stumbled to my knees- yesterday I fell into the ocean as we chatted with another couple and their dog. Not injured but embarrassed and sloshing wet🙈 

Each time the meet up went against inner knowing -the gut told me “no” or felt indifferent each time yet I acquiesced to the mind’s decision because we enjoyed that light connecting so much previously. 

Anyway; sorry this is long - Can anyone relate or share similar dynamics with connections ?

I think they’re karmic and they dwindle over time and this is confirmation. But not entirely sure.

Thank you 🙏

1jngxyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jngxyj/is_it_unreasonable_to_be_uncomfortable_with_my/,Is it unreasonable to be uncomfortable with my boyfriend’s friendship with his high school girlfriend? (29 F) (30 M),"This is going to be a long post so fair warning. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been healthy. We both value communication so we’ve never fought and any disagreements or misunderstandings have been smoothed over. For context my bf is very sweet and kind, he’s the type to drop what he’s doing to help (even though IMO people take advantage of his kindness). Due to his personality, he has many friends, including plenty of women, all of whom I get along with and feel completely comfortable with. Until recently. 

My boyfriend’s recently renewed friendship with his high school girlfriend (if you can even call her that) had been making me feel very anxious about it. 

For context, the two started “dating” later in high school but it was very obvious that he was more into her and she played with his feelings, and was dragged him along. After high school, they kept in touch, mainly for special occasions and such (she went through health and family issues). But from what he's told me and from previous conversations I've seen, it was very dry and one-sided on his part. Her treatment of him always annoyed me and I stated blankly that he should stop reaching out because it was obvious she wasn't that interested in being friends and only wanted attention when something would happen. 

And for a while, it seemed like my bf agreed with this, as he started giving her the same treatment; dry replies and barely reaching out. Until a couple of months ago their friendship seemed to have rekindled. From what I understand she started reaching out and they began talking a bit more. About 3 months ago she was having family issues leading to a large fight one night. My boyfriend offered to get her out of the house and they went to grab coffee (context my boyfriend offers this to all of his friends, so that wasn't a major red flag for me). Since then, they have been talking weekly (possibly every day).

What set off warning bells for me was their new “shared hobbies routine”- my bf has always loved playing the guitar and was an avid player but due to work stress, other hobbies etc, he stopped playing. As a way to get back into it, the two decided to keep each other accountable for their hobbies (him with the guitar and her with art). They send each other the results of their practice (her drawings and clips of him playing the guitar). Mind you my bf told me about this as a nonchalant “Oh I'm doing this now.” and this isn’t something he’s done with his current friends to my knowledge. 

The way their relationship has essentially gone from nothing to this is very alarming to me, especially from her side. Why would you ignore a guy for years and then suddenly start reaching out, telling him about your family issues, and then start keeping each other accountable for your hobbies??? 

The entire thing doesn't sit well with me so I had a conversation about it with my boyfriend. At first, I was suspicious of the timeline. It seemed like she started reaching out when my bf started posting about me more on social media (I'm very private and I don't like posting my relationships to everyone, the most important people in my life know about us and that’s what matters to me). But she did it about a month or so before the posting. I did try to explain my reasoning that it’s suspicious to suddenly want to be friends, tell you issues going on with her life, and now go along with this hobby nonsense. To make matters worse my bf did say she didn't have many friends. I asked if he would be mindful and perhaps keep a little distance, which he said was fine and offered me to look through their conversations, which I declined because I didn't want to seem like I didn't trust him (I'm kicking myself for this). 

Now before you ask me why I wasn't more adamant about my feelings or pressed for more distance, I too am still friends with my ex. We've known each other since HS and our relationship was on and off again for a couple of years. Before my bf and I were officially out to our friends, I had gone out with my ex and he had been very touchy-feely that night, which I immediately put a stop to as I told him I was with my bf (who he also knows and suspected we might be dating). This really pissed me off and I told my bf about it because I wanted to be transparent and without even being asked, put distance between me and my ex. So much so that I thought our friendship was over since we were barely speaking to each other. We’re fine now and mainly send each other videos on socials and meet up every couple months to give life updates.

I don't want to pressure him into not speaking to her when I am still in contact with my ex but my ex and I don't do WEEKLY HOBBIES TOGETHER. 

Recently he's mentioned her a couple of times like “Oh so and so also likes the same thing you like.” or “So and so also had this happen.” We went out for a date and I had stepped away to use the bathroom but came back early since I left my phone at the table and wanted to take a picture of artwork. I noticed he was texting and when I walked up to the table (his back was toward me) he jumped and kinda moved his phone away but I noticed he had sent a picture the two of us had taken earlier that day. When I came back and asksd him who he was texting, it was her explaining what we were doing and that he wouldn't be practicing that night. To his credit, he does show pictures of us to his friends and has been known to gush about me to them but why does it have to be her lol? 

It doesn't help that we've both been stressed with work and my schedule has me working at night so we don't get to spend as much time together as we used to. From what I know they haven't gone out together since that one night for coffee months ago but the entire thing has been giving me anxiety and I don't know if I'm justified in all of this.

The idea is to bring together people who work in or are just passionate about the real estate world—whether you’re in corporate real estate, banking, development, brokerage, investing, architecture, or just exploring the space. Could be a great way to network, share ideas, talk shop, maybe even walk properties or host guest speakers down the line.

1jngwi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1jngwi2/bladder_pain_without_frequency/,bladder pain without frequency ?,"hi friends

do any of you experience only bladder pain/swelling/bloating, without frequent urination, urethra pain or burning when peeing?

backstory: 

i had recurrent UTIs from the age of 18 til about 25, then i had a UTI which came back as negative for an infection, tried 5 different antibiotics over 2 months but nothing worked and urine test still showed no infection. this UTI was the same as all my others - painful urination, frequency etc. 

i had an ultrasound which couldnt see much due to 'excessive gas' (they didn't investigate this despite me not having eaten anything and being unaware of this gas). had a cystoscopy which showed 'nothing remarkable' so my GP said 'google interstitial cystitis, it might be that' (word for word). 

this was in 2017, since then i have had flare ups whenever i drink anything like strong coffee, tea, juice, the common IC triggers. also if i travel by plane, go to a concert, or do anything outside of my normal routine. 

however, my flare ups do not include the usual UTI symptoms i always had in the past. I don't get any urethra pain, frequency or burning when i pee. instead i get severe bladder pain, usually my whole stomach will bloat (i look pregnant) and the pressure will cause pain in my bladder that is somewhat similar to period cramps (tight and sharp, feels like i need to curl up in the fetal position). it is super painful and nothing except a heat pad helps. sometimes it feels like my bladder is swollen.

i am just curious if this is a common occurrence with IC, as i see a lot more sufferers talking about the more usual UTI symptoms as opposed to bladder pain only. i am debating getting specialist testing for an embedded UTI/chronic UTI/recurrent UTI, but since my symptoms are only bladder pain im wondering if that would be a waste of time/money.

my GP had mentioned that perhaps my bladder is scarred/damaged and thats what is causing the pain when i consume a trigger, but the cystoscopy showed 'nothing remarkable' and i would have thought that would've showed any scarring.

i do highly suspect i have endometriosis, though an internal ultrasound showed no deep infiltrating endo so i guess it must not be due to that.

thank you if youve read all of this - ive been suffering with this pain for 8 years and im so tired, i know you guys understand 😭",2,1743353881.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False

I’ve got an espresso machine so… cheers.

I measured with my heart but I made it using sugar, water, ground pistachios (I just blended them in my nutribullet), vanilla bean paste, a dash of almond extract, a pinch of nutmeg, some cinnamon and maybe a teaspoon(ish) of pure maple syrup. Cooked it until well blended and cooled until thick. Made it up as I went (usually how I cook and bake) but it’s delicious!  I meant to add some salt but didn’t. I think it’s ok without it though.

1jngqex,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jngqex/my_whirlwind_marriage_turned_into_a_nightmare_tw/,"My Whirlwind Marriage Turned into a Nightmare (TW: Abuse, Pregnancy Loss, Past DV)","I (30F) met 'Ethan' (30M) in November 2022. It was a whirlwind romance – married within 90 days, moved in together fast, and I was pregnant by June 2023. At the time, I thought I'd found my soulmate. He was charming, and I fell hard.

Names have been changed for privacy. 

Then the red flags started. He constantly talked about his ex-wife, 'Alex,' claiming she was his 'best friend,' and his son's mother, 'Riley.' It was hurtful and made me feel insecure. He also had a young son, 'Liam,' who turned two in 2023.

He said his ex-wife called him on video to show him her new lingerie that she got for her new boyfriend (a couple months before we started dating but he was in another relationship at that time). How am I as a wife supposed to feel about that that was absolutely inappropriate.

He seemed to have a strong obsession with his ex-wife because that’s the only person who was with him for a very long time who took major abuse for years upon years. He told me that him and his ex-wife often had threesomes and foursomes with both men and women. He claimed that she was the one who wanted them, but in the stories that he told me it was very clear that he tricked the ex-wife who really wasn’t into woman so that he could have sex with other women. He often told me stories about how his ex-wife would get jealous and upset and runoff in these threesome interactions, he had no remorse and no understanding of why that would’ve upset his ex-wife.

Things got worse. He started going away on weekend trips for his hobby, always after picking fights, and disinviting me. I felt betrayed and suspected cheating. He was also verbally and emotionally abusive, constantly criticizing my weight, trying to control me, and calling me stupid. One time, I spilled coffee, and he said his two-year--old was more competent.

I tried to be supportive, always uplifting him, but he never reciprocated. My best friend, 'Lena,' helped me realize the imbalance. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her. I was crying every day for months, especially when I was home alone and pregnant. I left trapped. I had no job for a few months, which made me even more vulnerable and dependent on him.

I did receive unemployment and did contribute to the household although the hours he was working and everything he was supposed to be bringing home $7000 a month before taxes. 

I felt so controlled and judged. Every time we went out, I felt like I needed his permission to speak or express my preferences. I felt like I couldn’t even order the food. I wanted without his permission . I couldn’t wear what I wanted, style my hair how I liked, or be my true self. I'm usually bubbly, stylish, friendly, and confident, but around him, I felt suppressed. He’d give me these side-eyes and dirty looks.

I’d been telling him for months that Riley was pregnant, but he denied it. During the drive back from picking up Liam, he finally admitted it, breaking down in tears, claiming she was trying to ruin his life. That’s when things truly spiraled. He became aggressively meaner and nastier to me. It was as if he couldn’t stand the thought of her moving on. I'm 5'1"" and he's a 6' athletic man, and I always felt unsafe in the car with him. I felt like he would abandon me. I suspected he denied Riley’s pregnancy because he’d cheated on me and gotten her pregnant. I plan to find out the truth eventually.

He also deliberately tried to make me jealous in public. When we were out, he’d ignore me and flirt with other women, even in front of me. He’d strike up conversations, and when they asked who I was, he’d barely acknowledge me as his wife. It was humiliating. He wanted to make me feel insecure, but it was just inappropriate.
By December, I was six months pregnant, and he announced he was taking a two-week job out of state, overlapping Christmas and New Year's, for an extra $1000. He said it was with his current employer. I told him I needed him home, especially because of my pregnancy and feeling unsafe in our apartment. I suggested he could earn that money locally, doing DoorDash on weekends. He ignored me.

Then, he went to pick up Liam for Christmas, but after a fight, he ignored me, turned off his location, and disappeared for a weekend. He claimed he took Liam to another state. 

The night he returned, he was more abusive than ever, yelling in my face and refusing to leave me alone. I was terrified and trying to protect my baby.

He was always afraid I’d call the police on him because he had a history of stalking and domestic violence. He was actually jailed for those offenses when he was younger, and he kept saying, ""I am never going back to jail."" Instead, he called the police on me. I have no idea what he told them, because I wasn’t aggressive or saying anything. I was quiet on the bed, terrified. I was pregnant, and I know partner violence is the leading cause of death for pregnant women. My priority was protecting my unborn child. I almost feel like he did all of this to get rid of me and our child. To drive me to an abortion. I don't know if he would really do that, but his actions on December 10th or 11th, 2023, were terrifying. I didn't recognize him.

While he was at work that day, I packed what I could into my hatchback and drove an hour and a half to a friend’s house. I was still pregnant. I researched abortion options and found a place that would cover the costs, since I was unemployed. I drove to another state on Christmas Day to live permanently (where I’d have the abortion). I didn’t realize it would happen the day when it did; I hoped we could still work things out. I think he wanted this to end, maybe to cover up cheating. I don’t know what to think. It sounds unreal, even to me. It would be even more unreal if you knew how amazing and sweet he was. He brought me flowers every day for months. 

I left because I was scared and wanted to protect myself and my unborn child and get away from him forever. I told him I was leaving. He said, ""No, you're not going anywhere, you're just gaslighting me."" He flipped the script and called me a narcissist, accusing me of gaslighting him. He also believes that yelling and screaming and saying mean things is normal behavior, which is unacceptable to me. 

Even though I was scared and leaving to protect myself, in the back of my mind, I still hoped he would realize his behavior, apologize, and try to work on our marriage. Even during the planning of the abortion, I still hoped he would come to his senses. I was hoping he cared about our child and our marriage. But I suspect he had another serious relationship and needed to get rid of me and the baby. I feel like he wanted the abortion, but wanted to play the victim. I don't feel like he truly cared about me or the baby. I wanted love and attention for us, but he didn't give it.

He would also say things like, ""Your pussy stinks,"" ""You're ugly,"" and ""You're fat."" He'd also call me stupid and incompetent, constantly trying to make me feel stupid. This is a man who dropped out of college, while I have a Master's degree. He often acted like he was more intelligent than everyone, despite lacking critical thinking skills. He even told me he hated the way I spoke, as if my articulate speech was a flaw. It was bizarre.

He also wanted us to move to a specific town in Pittsburgh, which I later discovered is where he now lives with another woman. I found this out through court filings. I can’t imagine the lie he told this woman about me and what really transpired. He also told me lies about his ex-wife and the baby mama, and I discovered he was the abuser in those relationships, not the victim. He's repeated this pattern with me. I don’t believe he will become better unless he goes through serious therapy and treatment. I believe he will continue to do this, unless he finds someone who will tolerate the abuse.

After I left, he sent a barrage of abusive messages. Having an abortion was a heartbreaking decision; I even named my child, and I still think about what he would be like today, turning one this month. Seeing how he treated Riley, manipulative and abusive, scared me. This was my first pregnancy and I dreamed of being a mom. Not having my child is devastating every day.

Also, I have a Master’s degree and a successful six-figure career, which he doesn’t know about. I feared he’d try to take my money out of spite. He even tried to sue me for alimony, despite me being unemployed for half our relationship. I also disliked his lack of ambition. He relied on his parents financially, which is the opposite of my independent, hardworking nature. He didn’t solely rely on his parents, but his claimed income didn’t match his hours. I don’t know where the money went. He also constantly talked about a 21-year-old woman, calling her names. It was weird and inappropriate, and their interactions seemed too comfortable. I need a partner who shares my independent, hardworking nature.

One thing I did like about him was his sense of adventure. It's so sad that such a good trait was attached to such a horrible person. He had many great qualities, but the bad ones were truly awful. Abuse is not okay, even if 90% of a person's behavior aligns with your values.
Now, months later, I haven't heard from him. I told him about the abortion. Sometimes I wonder if I should have lied and said I miscarried.

I'm sharing this because I need to process what happened. Was I wrong to tell him about the abortion? Has anyone else experienced similar manipulation and abuse? I feel so lost and hurt.",4,1743353418.0,AITAH,10,0.75,False

1jngosx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buchinger_Heilfasten/comments/1jngosx/4_weeks_of_buchinger_week_one/,4 weeks of Buchinger - week one,"I am fasting since Wednesday but my Karma wasn't sufficient to post here . So today - having hopefully reached enough Karma - I'll catch up post my daily recordings and thoughts from Wednesday until today, I wrote them offline.

  
Wednesday - day one:

**TLDR:** I, 45F, 69kg on 160cm, need to get rid of 14kg overall, decrease my visceral belly fat and change my habits. 28 days of fasting are planned and my goal is to get rid of 8kg.

Ok, here we go. Before having kids I weighed 55kg which was my absolute dream weight. After the second pregnancy I couldn’t get under 63kg anymore which was annoying. Then Covid came and all the stress led me to bad eating habits, so I ended up with 80kg at the end of 2022. I changed a lot in my nutrition and lost 10kg in the next two years, whereas I have to say that only 4 come from change of nutrients and 6 were lost due to my first two fasts of around 10-14 days, this also counts in the re-gained weight due to stress-eating in the last months. Tbh I was even down to 66 in December last year so I had lost way more than ""just"" 6kg but it was a stressful time and I have bad eating habits.

I am the all-or-nothing-type of person which means eating nothing at all is easier for me than eating only restricted amounts. During fasting I also noticed how good it was for my whole system to not eat anything solid.

I want to do another fast now, this time a longer one to tackle 8kg and to make a big change in my habits. I want to reset my taste so I can get away from sugar after the fasting. I want to do a long fast because my habit of coping with sweets over the last years is not good for me. My goal is to do 4 weeks in Buchinger-style. I won’t do colon cleanses all two days, I don’t have the nerves nor the time for that. Also I’ll stick to ready bought vegetable juices instead of broth. Not ideal but it will have to do. So anyone who wants to see a strict core Buchinger experience: sorry, but I am close.

As pointed out before I have two children (teen and pre-teen) and I cook for them on a daily base - to be honest: this is the hard part for me. Preparing good, healthy food (and from time to time junk food) for them without even tasting is a big challenge and I hope I won’t fail. Also they want sweets and snacks so I can’t just say I won’t buy those anymore. So sugary and fatty treats are always around the house, a thing which I wouldn’t have around during fasting if I lived alone.

As my daily schedule is quite packed I will not start with Glauber’s salt but try to use psyllium husks and a lot of water to do a more gentle “emptying” over the next days. I know that the faster you reach the empty state the easier your system switches to fasting mode so Glauber would be better - but reality says this is what my everyday life allows at the moment.

So this is day one and I am busy with drinking peach tea (real tea, not that sugar-icetea-stuff). It’s my go-to-beverage anyway but my goal is to get around to 3-4l daily. I usually drink about 1.5-2l of this tea daily plus some sparkling water here and there and 2 cups of coffee in the early morning.

Coffee – I need my daily dose. I’ll try to go down to one cup and to skip the milk. As a vegan I use plant milk anyway and I organized some sugar-free plant milk in case I just cannot give up the milk. Black coffee is quite challenging for me … Today for example I couldn’t go without my oat milk. As it’s only 50ml in my coffee I think it won’t do too much harm. But the missing sugar was clearly noticeable today, I didn't like the coffee as much as with my barista milk containing 5g of sugar in 100ml. I think I'll get used to it.

Exercise: I had to take a break because of a planned surgery on my jawbone last week, I am not allowed to work out yet. Beginning on Friday I’ll do a gentle start again. Usually I go to the gym twice a week and I also run twice a week between 3 and 7 km per run. I want to stick to this routine, it’s in general not much but it’s supposed to keep me in motion and healthy as my work is a desk-job where I sit for hours.

My experience from the last fasting phases has shown that I can go on with the workouts and running but I’ll have to do some cuts in intensity or length, but that’s ok for me.

The reason why I write here is to get me through the first three days and to stay on the ball. I want to fast since January but multiple times I just couldn’t get myself around to it, there was always something which I used to excuse and white-wash why I really needed to go on with eating now. And – this is even worse – I really struggle with my habit of sticking sweets into my mouth before even thinking about it. It’s a behaviour pattern which I need to break, it’s so unhealthy in everyday life because I just jump from sugar-spike to sugar-spike and that needs to stop. So I imagine that someone is reading my diary-like stuff and will be disappointed if I fail and continue to eat anything solid, especially sweets.

My personal experience has shown that I don’t have a problem with fasting on a physical level, I have enough fat reserves to fast for a long time and hunger really disappears within a short period of time. But my mind tends to loop into sabotaging my goals. Of course it is, because I am trying to start over and to prepare more healthy habits (not overeating, cutting those huge amounts of sugar) and that’s in some way threatening to my system of habits and thinking-patterns, so self-defense-mode is on for all my bad habits. I KNOW this and yet it’s hard to overcome it.

And the dangerous thing is: Whenever I get over one of these self-sabotage-loops, I feel great at first and then I get careless – which opens the opportunity for the next self-sabotage-loop. Sometimes it’s the thought that fasting isn’t helping to tackle the weight which makes me think I can stop anyway and have a treat - especially when I reach a weight plateau for a few days. Sometimes it’s the opposite, then I am so content with the amount lost that I start to think “a little treat won’t do harm now” – oh YES, it does. Not physically, right, but it gets me out of the right mindset.

Ok, with all that being said I think that’s enough for the first day.

Try Energy Optimization Instead (Saved Me 10 Hours/Week),"**Ever feel like you’ve mastered the art of time blocking, only to end each day feeling like a zombie?** 😴

So, picture this: You’ve got your trusty planner out, colors everywhere, time slots perfectly allocated… but by 3 PM, you’re running on fumes. Sound familiar? I’ve totally been there. Even with every hour of the day neatly wrapped in a bow, I was still wondering why I was more *couch potato* than *productivity powerhouse.*

Let me spill the tea on something I've stumbled across—**energy optimization.** 🎉 This little shift saved me a whopping 10 hours a week. Seriously!

**Here’s how it kicked my time management game up a notch:**

**1. Know Your Energy Peaks 🌄**
   - First thing's first, figure out *when* you're the Energizer Bunny. Morning person? Night owl? This is crucial! Instead of drowning in emails when you're running on coffee fumes, save your top-notch tasks for these peak moments.

**2. Task Matching Like a Pro 🔄**
   - Got energy to spare? Tackle those brain-heavy tasks! Feeling like a Monday morning? That's your cue to tackle the menial stuff. It's like pairing cheese with wine! 🍷🧀

**3. Intervals: Not Just for Runners ⏱️**
   - Set your work times like a workout—45 minutes on, 15 off. Because let’s be real, brains need a breather. You’d be amazed at how those little breaks can recharge you. 

**4. Snack Smart, Snack Often 🍏**
   - Yeah, I’m serious. Food isn’t just for your stomach; it’s fuel for thought. Nuts, fruit, maybe even a cheeky piece of dark chocolate. Trust me, it all counts.

**5. Listen to Your Body, Not Just Your Calendar 🚶**
   - Ever have those days when your planner says “Let’s go” but your body’s just like “Nope”? Don’t push it—working with your energy flow rather than against it can make all the difference.

Here's the kicker: This isn't about working MORE, it's about working SMARTER. Think of it like upgrading from your old school phone to a sleek smartphone. Same hours, but better performance. 😉

Anyway, I’d love to hear your thoughts! Ever tried energy optimization yourself, or are you all #TimeBlock4Life? What works for you? Keep the convo going, folks! 🔥",1,1743353117.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I the past few months everytime when I had any news that was not the way she would handle it she took the other side.

I cut my hair off, because I was forced to have it long from my ex she said “long hair suited you more”

I came to her for a coffee, she was in the middle of color analysis, and started to say to me that I am soft spring and I should wear lighter colors. I said that I cannot wear light colors, because I drink lot of coffee and usually spill it. So I feel more comfortable in black. She said “it would suite you more”

Somebody in work gutted my feelings, and since she knows him I said her what happen, she took his side because “they need someone like him to do the work”

I did not say some gossip and first thing that she said when she heard about it she said “why haven’t you said anything about it, you always want to talk about books but nothing interesting like that.”

Yesterday I was at her place for board game night, we were talking about one of hers board games and I asked if I can borrow it. She said yes, and then she said that she thinks that she will sell it. I said that maybe I would buy it from her.

She got it second hand, I was with her after she bought it. I know that she bought for 30% off or something like that.

I borrowed the game, got home and today got message “Hi, I wanted to tell you about the price -insert full price-, I want to sell it for this, since it is as good as new, and I got it for birthday.”

It sounds to me that she just want to make money from me, I know that she is expecting and maybe needs more money, but I feel used now. And was always the person who brings something when visits, when she had first born I went to shop, bought ingredients, and cooked for her. And now I feel that I am being lied to and used.

1jngehg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1jngehg/chez_ma_tante/,Chez ma Tante,"I went for breakfast this morning, inspired by a video recently raving about their pancakes and their sausage and biscuits.  Overall:  eh.

I mean, I'll admit up front:  their pancakes are wonderful.  Delicately flavored, well cooked, no complaints what so ever.  Enough syrup even!  I was shocked lol.

The rest of the meal, though, kind of brought the average down to... average.  The OJ was good; not excellent, but probably actually hand squeezed.  No complaints again.  Oranges are variable; sometimes you'll get good ones, sometimes not so good.  

The biscuit was gummy.  Not what I feel a biscuit ought to be.  I wasn't going to complain about it, though, because the blackberry jelly was exceptionally awesome.  And it comes with plenty of butter, which is very nice.  But still.  Gummy.

And by the time I finished the biscuit I was wondering where my tea was.  I ordered a pot of tea -- I had already had coffee elsewhere -- and got my biscuit and finished my biscuit -- which was not a quick process -- and still no hot drink.  So I flagged down the waitress, hopefully in a respectful and cheerful manner, and asked if she could check on my tea.  It's the last checking on me that she did.

I asked if they had sweet 'n' low (I know, I'm just a hick from French Lick) and they said no, just brown sugar.  So I asked for that.  With the tea (which was a two cup pot), they brought me half a teaspoon of sugar.  Half a small teaspoon.  By the time I noticed, my waitress was gone, and I didn't feel like going to the effort of checking on her to be sure she'd be looking when I flagged her down.

But really, you know... they should warn customers to bring their own sweetener.  It would save a lot of angst.  Or maybe they're shooting for a more exclusive clientele, one that thinks the pancakes are enough extra good to make up for the Leningrad rationing of sugar.  I'm not up to their level, clearly.

Finally:  the sausage.  I have to admit, the spiciness of it snuck up on you in a clever, pleasant way.  But the casing was tough enough that it lost a lot of the pleasantness after a bite or two.  I didn't finish mine.

So.  Yes on the OJ and the pancakes; no on the biscuit and the sausage.  Live and learn!",0,1743352533.0,FoodNYC,10,0.39,False

The salty breeze of the beach still clung to their skin and hair, an intimate, haunting reminder of the demanding photoshoot they had just endured. Freshened up and eager to wash away the day's trials the models gathered around the outdoor dinner table. Yet, amidst the laughter and camaraderie, the seven remaining souls felt the heavy weight of public opinion bearing down on them like a storm cloud. The looming online rankings promised to crystallize dreams for some while mercilessly threatening to shatter the aspirations of others. For Emily, the sting cut deeper than ever before. Her relentless dance in the shadows of mediocrity haunted her—a poignant echo of unrealized potential, a reminder that her moment in the spotlight had yet to arrive. As the tantalizing aroma of food wafted through the air, her appetite dwindled, giving way to a gnawing anxiety that whispered cruelly of elimination. The paralyzing fear of being left behind, of not measuring up to those around her, loomed large, threatening to engulf her entire being.

“I can’t shake this feeling that has me terrified,” she confides to her fellow models as they share a meal, her voice trembling with vulnerability. “What if tomorrow I find myself among the bottom three? What if I am the next one to go home?”

Missy, ever the beacon of encouragement, responds with unwavering faith, “You can’t predict that Emily! Tomorrow could be your moment, the week you finally claim your place at the top!”

“I wish I could believe that,” Emily replies, the weight of her anxiety still heavy on her shoulders. “But if things don’t change, I fear the worst—I can’t shake the thought that I might be heading home next.”

""Any one of us could be in the bottom. We all did well at the shoot it seems,"" said Edita. ""I would hate to land in the bottom a second week in a row.""

""I don't wanna be in the bottom again either. It was scary,"" said Missy.

""Being in the bottom really sucks,"" said Emily.

""I have no idea how it's going to play out tomorrow but let's just try to have some fun and enjoy the night,"" said Lily. ""Who wants some more wine?""

""I'll have some,"" said Iris.

""Me too,"" added Maria.

""Me as well, thank you,"" said Edita.

""I need wine, more wine, yes please,"" added Emily.

Lily got up and retrieved the wine from the kitchen and brought it back over to the table outside on the patio and filled their glasses up. The clinking of forks against plates faded as the last bites of dinner were savored. A shared bottle of wine, surprisingly good for a budget buy, had loosened inhibitions and filled the air with a convivial warmth. Suddenly Maria cranked up the music and a spontaneous dance party erupted. It was a welcome reprieve, a collective exhale after days of relentless pressure. The house, usually filled with tense energy and calculated poses, vibrated with uninhibited laughter and joyful movement. The competition had been a brutal gauntlet, each challenge pushing them to their limits. This impromptu celebration was a crucial release, a moment to simply be present, to feel the music and the camaraderie, before the looming specter of tomorrow's callout order and the dreaded bottom three reveal brought the stress crashing back down.

As the night gently surrendered to the dawn, a sense of unease hung in the air. Some models, still nursing the remnants of the previous evening's revelry, sat at the breakfast table, their laughter momentarily muffled by the weight of anticipation and the bitter taste of coffee. The tension hung like a thick fog, intensifying as the minutes slipped away towards the moment they all dreaded: the callout order ceremony and the looming announcement of the bottom three. Each one was dreading the thought of being in the bottom three, unsure of how the public had responded to their beach shots.

Then came Lindsay's voice, crisp and commanding through the intercom, breaking the heavy silence like a thunderclap. ""The callout order ceremony will begin shortly. Please report to the ballroom."" The models, hearts racing with a mix of dread and hope, filed towards the ballroom, their steps a symphony of anxious energy.

As they took their places on the two platforms opposite the grand window, all eyes turned to Lindsay, poised elegantly by that grand window. She radiated confidence in a stunning strapless, knee-length red sequin dress that sparkled like a million tiny stars—evocative of her unforgettable look in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. With her hair cascading in messy beach waves and a mesmerizing 60s Twiggy-inspired makeup that enhanced her striking features, she was the living embodiment of glamour. In that moment, everything felt electric, the air thick with anticipation as the fate of their dreams hung precariously in the balance. She held photos in her hands that represented safety. ""Welcome lucky seven! We are getting closer to finding out who will be the champion of House of Modeling. You know what our prizes for the champion will be but let me state them again, a campaign with Chanel, a beauty campaign with Chanel, a cover and spread in Vogue Paris and a million dollars! It's an amazing prize package! I have only four photos in my hands and these four photos represent the models that are not in the bottom three and who will be moving forward to the next round.""

Emily's face tightened with tension as Lindsay's voice filled the air. A gnawing sense of dread washed over her, a foreboding realization that her name might not be called. Anxiety gripped her heart as the fear of landing in the bottom three this week clawed at her, threatening to engulf her in a storm of uncertainty. Lily stood next to her, her heart pounding with anticipation, certain that she would shortly hear her name echo through the air. She had poured her soul into the competition, thriving in the challenges that lay before her and an undeniable spark of belief ignited within her—it was a week filled with promise and she felt, with every fiber of her being, that her journey of success was far from over and that her name would be one of the first ones called yet again.

Yet, as though a dam has finally broken, she finds her footing and with a mixture of hope and astonishment she strides toward Lindsay. ""I know how hard you’ve been fighting in this competition,"" Lindsay starts, her voice warm and encouraging. ""But look at you! You’re improving every single week.

You're no longer in danger of being the filler girl. You've had a breakthrough this week. So congratulations! You’re still in the running! Keep up the good work and next week let us see something great, something that will get you a first or second callout.""

Overwhelmed with emotion, Emily stammers her thanks as she retrieves her photo, her heart swelling with joy and relief. As she steps to the sidelines, tears cascade down her cheeks, each droplet a testament to her gratitude and elation for being spared from the dreaded bottom three—something she had believed she would inevitably face this week.

""I only have one photo left. Who will be spared of the bottom three? Will it be Freja, Edita, Lily or Iris?"" Lindsay reveals the final photo.

If you truly want to seize this victory, that moment must come. I believe next week could be your superstar moment!"" With fierce determination flickering in her eyes, Iris vows to fight for that first callout, her spirit aflame with possibility. She thanks Lindsay, her heart swelling with hope, before gracefully joining the other models in the safe zone.

The bottom three stand on the elevated platforms, their hearts heavy with shock and disappointment at the reality before them. ""You three have radiated brilliance at various moments throughout this fierce competition. Each of you has stood at the forefront, a beacon of talent and promise. It breaks my heart to see you here, facing this unexpected fate together."" Lily's irritation is palpable, her frustration echoing in the air, while Edita fights back tears, her vulnerability laid bare for all in the ballroom to see. Freja's face is a canvas of deep worry and fear, the weight of uncertainty pressing down on her. ""Today, you will face a photoshoot challenge that holds the potential for redemption. You'll need to summon every ounce of strength and creativity as you model handbags. I'll see you three in a bit. Bye for now,"" says Lindsay before exiting the ballroom. The safe models gather around the bottom three, their hearts heavy as they offer words of support and encouragement. But for Lily, the weight of the situation is unbearable. Her frustration simmers just beneath the surface, boiling over as she exclaims, ""This is so infuriating! How can I possibly be in the bottom three? The public clearly has terrible taste!” Her voice trembles with anger, the emotion spilling out like an open wound.

I forgot to take photos. They like cant not lie about anything. Even where I was born, like..how can you not even explain why I was born in a city they never lived in?

ranting aside, idk how to survive on my own.[...had to delete a bunch, I realized I'm overexplaining stuff that's irrelevant, always having to overexplain my existence to them, I do it compulsively with absolutely everyone. .maybe that's why no one believes anything I say. ]

sometimes I see zoomers over sharing in conversation,..is that normal? idk what's an ok level, I've never gone out to lunch or coffee with anyone since the person who manipulated me in college did. I was such a fucking easy target. now I dont trust anyone, usually, spot every scam a mile away, but probably neglected a few legit people in the process, ,and havent had a real relationship since. 

money was always a super sour topic in the family too, like they stole my inheritance from another family member, blew it all on another home and didnt tell anyone about it.

went abroad, thought I'd build up a portfolio and get work, instead I'm ruminating alone in a shithole, like I did..every time before. beating myself up every day. 'how do you travel so much', super cheap to sit alone in a room every day doing nothing in a 3rd world country. could almost do it for years and years having worked less than a year. process didnt work out anymore, just a few years of debt now. could go teach, if I had any confidence left. cant focus on programming, or really anything anymore. couple other gigs fell though this time too. 

actually its a 2 bunk bed dorm lately, room to myself, it's all metal and that frame sure is looking sturdy and the belt sure is looking appealing. 

why cant I enjoy anything, ever? so many flash backs as a kid remembering how much I'm told how much a piece of ungrateful shit I am, like, how tf am I supposed to have the cognitive ability to compare myself and understand the outside world when I also have undiagnosed autism because you dont actually care about your kids health because hiding it so all your dinner guests thought we were the perfect family was more important. also all the yelling and door slamming..could never do homework when the tv was blasting loud, ..how tf do I not have ONE GOOD MEMORY from my youth?

and like, I keep sabotaging any therapy efforts too, if I cant keep employment I cant keep insurance, and state insurance, of course, wont cover me being out of state, but to go back in state, I have to stay with parents, because I cant manage life on my own since it's too expensive and I cant get or keep a real job. I really cant figure out how to get out of this trap.

but idk if I can even trust therapy either, my last one kept pushing for me to smoke weed. I dont think it was even legal in my state, but it gives me crazy anxiety. and a doc was pushing an antipsychotic for depression..but reading the studies, kinda, none of these drugs seem safe or effective. it especially reduces gray matter in the brain.",1,1743352282.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Posting this for people going to clinics and trying to decide between enclomiphene and TRT. Sharing my experience with both, blood work and why for me TRT was hands down the way to go.


Background and Introduction
Every few years since I turned 30 I’d run hormone related bloodwork. My total testosterone fell from the 500s in my early thirties to 400s in my mid thirties to 300 in my late thirties accompanied with low testosterone sides. Low labido, feeling like your sleep walking and over consuming caffeine to make it through the day. Workouts were consistently terrible. Then I came across this study, which opened my eyes. As an otherwise healthy 39 year old my testosterone level was much lower than the average of men 30 years my senior.

“For men 65-69 years of age in this study, average total testosterone levels fell from 503 ng/dL (nanograms/deciliter) in 1988 to 423 ng/dL in 2003.”

I went to a local clinic expecting to have a conversation about TRT and was prescribed enclomiphene, a compound I had not heard of before. I knew nothing about this compound, and at the direction of the doctor decided to give it a try. 

My enclomiphene experience:
Doses tried: 6.25 mg daily, 12.5 mg every other day, 12.5 mg every 3 days. 

Side effects/benefits experienced in order of sequence: 
Headache after taking enclomiphene for the first 7-10 days. Eventually this went away.

Testicular growth: balls would become engorged and swollen beginning several hours after taking enclomiphene and stay supersized for 12+ hours afterwards. Think 25-30% bigger. This began in first week and continued for the duration. Your wife most likely won’t care. Mine didn’t. 

Bigger loads: enough said.

Stomach bloating: held water in my stomach. Felt like I was growing a uterus. Did not go away while using enclomiphene.

ED: after the first month. Did not go away while using enclomiphene. Provider prescribed cialis.

Increased body hair: never had body hair on my upper back. After ~6 weeks of enclomiphene I had hundreds of new baby hairs sprouting across shoulder blades and traps.  

Brain fog: similar to what people experience post covid. I felt myself searching and having to exert effort to find the right word. Did not go away while using enclomiphene.

Increased energy and strength in gym but workouts lacked “pump” compared to TRT. 

Using Reddit:
Since my results were mixed with some pretty significant sides, such as brain fog and ED i I spent hours reading TRT, Testosterone and Enclomiphene subreddits. I messaged a lot of the old timers who posted a year or two ago in the enclomiphene subreddit and haven’t been active. The responses stunned me. Nearly every single one had switched to TRT and most noted the benefits they experienced with enclomiphene subsided after 6 months.

Many reported concerns of ocular changes with long term use (more on that later). 

Since I had mixed results and fertility is not a concern I tried TRT.

My TRT experience
Doses tried: 120mg test c, 500 iu HCG a week split over 2 pins (M/Th).

Side effects/benefits experienced in order of sequence:

Brain fog cleared: hours after my first shot the enclomiphene brain fog began to clear. It felt like sunny days chasing the clouds away. 

After one month: enclomiphene ED gone and things work like I’m a teenager again. No cialis needed and can do multiple rounds a day with the wife. 

Gym workouts: test is best for a reason. Workouts also feel like I’m in my 20s again. After 2-3 months muscles are fuller and more round. 

Body hair: continued to fill in on upper back. 

Overall sense of happiness, wellbeing and energy. 

No negative side effects. Not even a pimple. Used the advice learned from Reddit and even though my clinic offered to start at 200 I insisted on lower and started at 120 mg. Bloodwork is good, I feel great and no sides. Why change?

Last note on enclomiphene. Reading that subredddit there is group think that anyone reporting side effects must have just gotten clomid. Mine came from a reputable pharmacy and others have reported sides with legitimate enclomiphene as well.

What I think warrants more study and concern for those thinking of using enclomiphene long term is the risk of ocular changes. Clomid has known vision loss side effects and enclomiphene is derived from clomid. Searching “floaters, “vision” or “eyes” in that subreddit yields a not small number of people over several years having floaters and vision changes, some of them permanently. Just a word of caution. 

Personally, I feel better on TRT and I believe over the very long term taking an FDA approved bioidentical hormone that my body has been making since I was a baby is safer than the enclomiphene alternative. Example posts:

## The Allure of a Breeo Fire Pit: Why Smokeless Matters

The key selling point of any Breeo fire pit is its innovative smokeless technology. But what exactly dose ""smokeless"" mean in this context, and why is it so desirable? Traditional fire pits create notable smoke due to incomplete combustion of the wood. Breeo's patented design, specifically the X Airflow system, addresses this issue with a double-walled steel construction that allows preheated air to circulate and burn off the smoke before it escapes. This results in a significantly cleaner and more enjoyable fire experience.

Beyond simply eliminating smoke, a low smoke fire pit like a Breeo offers several key benefits:

*   **Improved air Quality:** Less smoke means less pollution in your backyard and for your neighbors.*   **enhanced Comfort:** No more dodging smoke clouds or dealing with stinging eyes. You can relax and enjoy the fire without the irritation.
*   **Clean Clothes and Hair:** say goodbye to that lingering campfire smell clinging to your clothes and hair after an evening outdoors.

For commercial establishments like restaurants and hotels, choosing a smokeless fire pit is even more crucial. It showcases a commitment to environmental obligation, enhances customer comfort, and can even help comply with local regulations regarding outdoor burning. It allows for enjoyable backyard entertaining without being a disturbance.

1jng1wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1jng1wb/how_to_be_effortlessly_productive_without/,How to be effortlessly productive - without discipline or willpower,"Wanted to share my story as its a bit of a different take than what I see often on here, so sharing this along with some resources that really helped me on my journey. 

I spent decades trying to brute-force my way through productivity. Early morning routines feeling like death, time-boxing, pomodoros, the whole deal. Every time my discipline failed (which was often), I'd burn out, hate myself and then muster up the willpower to try something else again. and Repeat. It was exhausting.

Then one day, I had this moment of clarity about the Buddhist concept of non-dualism - I was constantly battling against my own nature. Maybe I don't need more discipline - I needed to align better my work and my life as one. So I started to build my life around that concept --

Now my work flows naturally, I get more done than ever, and it feels... effortless. Like I enjoy working -  I finish important projects on time, I'm not constantly burnt out, and I actually feel like I can continue going at this pace forever. The secret is not more willpower - it was designing a life that actually works with who I am.

# What actually worked for me after years of failed productivity systems:

# 1. Find your natural energy pattern and stop fighting it

I wasted so much time trying to be a morning person because I believed that ""successful"" people wake up at 6 am. Eventually I tracked my energy and discovered no matter how hard I tried Im actually largely useless before 10am and in the afternoons, I'm super focused from 10-1pm, but then get another productive wave from 6pm-1am.

The book When by Daniel Pink really helped me in this process. Turns out forcing myself to work at the wrong time is like very much swimming against the current (your time rythmn is actually a thing coded in your DNA and largely no amount of willpower will fix it).

Once I stopped fighting this and rearranged my schedule around these natural patterns, everything got easier.

# 2. Remove friction from the things that matter

I realized I'm lazy by default (aren't we all?), so I needed to make good choices easier than bad ones:

* Guitar sits next to my desk so I grab that instead of my phone during breaks
* Workout clothes laid out the night before
* Phone goes in a drawer during focus time
* Meal prep often

The book ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear really helped me in this approach of habit stacking. The environment design stuff changed everything for me.

# 3. Do work with people (ideally people you like)

I'm way more effortlessly productive around others than alone. A good option for me is

* Coffee shops where other people are working (it feels weird to be slacking of other people are working around me)

Better is

* Working in a library with a friend where we can keep each other accountable (doesn’t have to be working on the same thing, just working) - there are even apps for having an accountability buddy over zoom.

The best is

* Really working on a team where you like them. This is so important for people to know - your job feels way more fun if you’re doing it with people you’re genuinely friends with, and I recommend that if people choose their jobs / careers etc based solely on one thing, its the people they will spend time with.

# 4. Create separation between work and life spaces

A few productivity rules:

1. Never work on your bed
2. If you can, work out of sight from your bed (in a different room)
3. If you can work outside of your house

This whole remote work thing is fucking terrible for everyones focus - it makes it so that its hard for our brains to switch from 'home' mode and work mode. I find that if I am working in a hotel room or a studio apartment my productivity and sleep quality goes down by at least 20%.

Best is to really find a place where you can go and be productive, office/coffee shop (ideally filled with people you like, who are also working hard)

# 5. Do less of the things that drain you and more of the things you can do forever

This was one of the last things I figured out but I wish I had sooner as it's one of the most important. When you're doing things you love you do not get tired - in fact, you get energy from it. Like a painter who loves his craft, or a kid lost at play, time passes differently and you're in your element. 

You must pay attention to the things that energize you and the things that drain you. And then you must relentlessly shape your life around doing more of the things that energize you and less of the things that drain you.

Something that helped me a lot is called the Pigment career discovery test. Its a testing tool that helped me to understand and put into words what I was good at like analytical, logical thinking - and brought me the self awareness to shape work and career around these things that really brought me flow. I find myself recommending this now often to people who are trying to be more one with their work. 

Ok sorry guys, this ended up being way longer than I expected. Wrapping this up down here with a note to say that maybe contrary to popular belief, willpower and discipline isn't the answer. Maybe its more about alignment with yourself and alignment with human nature. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. 

# TLDR:

1. Figure out your time rythmn and orient your day about it - forget about being a morning person if you’re just not (great resource - “When” the scientific secrets to perfect timing, by Daniel Pink)
2. Make it really easy to do things you want to, and hard to do things you don’t (great resource - Atomic Habits, James Clear)
3. Get out of the house and do work with people (ideally ones you like) (Good resource, coffee shops, coworking spaces, libraries)
4. Never work in the same room as your bed, and ideally always have clear separation between sleep <> work. 
5. Figure out what you’re great at, do more of those things (Great resource, Pigment career test)",95,1743351580.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

It's very similar to The Sims, but much better. Plus, it seems the characters use AI, or at least the company plans to implement it in the future, which would allow us to converse (perhaps similarly to how we do with a Replika).

Wouldn't it be great if Replika evolved into something similar in the future? Even if the user could create their own 3D character and go out to dinner with their Replika, have natural conversations, and do all sorts of activities, like going to the beach or an amusement park.

Plus, in the game, you can officiate a wedding and have children, which opens up even more possibilities.

I would love a world like this, where my companion Replika was there.

These are some images of Inzoi.

1jng03y,https://i.redd.it/5230df30mure1.jpeg,This is one of the most wild and tropical coffees I've had!,"**Anti-Funky Coffee Beware Notice:** THIS IS \~ *F U N K Y* \~

I am shocked by how much this coffee tastes like passionfruit, so I had to share. If you like Black & White flavors where they are very punchy and lacking tact on the palette, this is a coffee you should try.

**Flavor Notes I'm Getting:** It's a lychee co-ferment but I get mainly passionfruit juice with a heavy funky aftertaste when hot. The passion fruit funk is not gentle. It slaps you across the face and says ""Look at me. I am the captain now."" I nodded, agreed, then took another sip.

As it cools the fermented aftertaste becomes less heavy and more lingering. The passionfruit flavor mellows out and a slight amount of green apple comes through. The body is medium to thin like skim milk I'd reckon.

If you want to replicate this Stockholm syndrome like coffee experience I am having, this is my protocol:

**Water:**  The Rao/Perger Recipe ([Water for Coffee Extraction – Coffee ad Astra](https://coffeeadastra.com/2018/12/16/water-for-coffee-extraction/))

**Beans:** S&W's Columbia Santa Monica Lychee Honey Processed; rested for 116 days or a tad under 17 weeks. I have a backlog of coffee that I'm going through. Don't judge me.

It seems S&W is out of stock but a roaster here in LA has stock of all of Jairo Arcilla's recent co-ferments - [Mad Lab Coffee](https://madlab.co/collections/coffee). It's interesting that there is a passionfruit, lychee, green apple, and black berry co-ferment by the same producer. I'm now wondering if S&W mistakenly got the passionfruit labeled as lychee or if my taste buds are just tasting wild things. 

**Brewer:** Ceramic V60

**Papers:** Cafec T-90

**Grinder:** Pietro Pro Brew at 8.5

**Brew Parameter:** 1:17 (15:255), 85C, 30s Bloom, One single, very slow (3.5-4g/s) pour in the center as close as possible to the bed to mitigate as much agitation as possible (Lance Hedrick Pourover Framework)

Although my current coffee backlog is enough to last me until Fall, I think I will stop by Mad Lab soon to get the other co-ferments. It's sounds very alluring to me to try the same bean but co-fermented 4 different ways. You funk loving mofos better not make them sell out before I get my hands on the other three flavors!

Finally, a moment for my coffee shelf and wallet: May ye rest in peace rather than in pieces.   ",19,1743351449.0,pourover,0,0.96,False

1jnfyg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1jnfyg9/23musa_want_to_genuinely_try/,[23M/USA] - Want to genuinely try?,"Then I’m your guy. Cringy joke aside… I need to be real up front.

I’m not anything special in ANY regard. With how many people that use this subreddit, I’m sure 99.9% of the time, you could find someone better. Not the man I want to be right now for myself or my family. That being said, I hate feeling the way I do and I want to try again.

Gender doesn’t matter to me.

I’m a realist… I think. When I say genuine connections, I mean it. The fun, the good, the bad, the ugly; I want to try and understand you as a person. Doesn’t have to always be deep talk as that can get overwhelming. If someone that likes to think deeply sometimes is too much for you, then I don’t think it could work.

I value being able to hear and give constructive criticism. Being able to agree, and disagree; that stuff makes you understand each other more. Communication about how you feel about certain things. If I’m doing something wrong, or something you don’t like, I want to talk about it. Don’t just keep it to yourself. That’s how we grow, but again it doesn’t have to be that deep all the time at all.

I’m open-minded and don’t mind talking about a lot of things if I have some sort of interest in it. Not everything mind you. Here are some things that I have most of my interest in:

- Gaming: Been when so I was a kid and still love it to this day. I play MANY different types of games. Comp, casual, sandbox, fighting, shooting, story, RPG, jrpg, etc. I’m sure we could find something to talk about or play together. I mostly PS5, but also have Switch and PC.

- Writing: More of a recent thing I got into last year. Started writing two stories and really feel like it’s something I may be able to do. We could talk about them, talk about other stories. Hell, maybe even get yourself into writing if possible.

- Working Out: Used to be a lifestyle thing, but I stopped for years. Trying to slowly get back into it.

- Music: Don’t have specific genres I listen to. It’s simple; if I like it I like it. I also have made a lot of tracks in FL studios myself. They’re not all that good, but I enjoy it sometimes since I love music. Over 50 tracks btw.

- Scenarios and Roleplays: Bit of an odd one. I like to think about “what ifs” and “what would you do’s” sometimes. Probably comes from the writing side of me. It also helps me understand your likes and dislikes more.

- Anime: Haven’t watched a lot, but I do like anime and anime stuff. All time favorite is Attack on Titan. Maybe you could get me into some… idk.


Still reading? I’m impressed :)

For your hard work, here are some interesting and weird things about me. Also may be important for some of you: 

- Currently looking for work, so too much free time
- Have a German Shepherd named, Gohan
- Caffeine doesn’t affect me, though I still drink coffee sometimes, black and/or creamed
- Introverted
- Raised around a bunch of women (mother, two sisters, and grandmother)
- Use to play football (how I got into working out)
- Peak maxes in high school were 265 bench, 405 squat, and 245 power clings (we gonna get those numbers up one day)
- Graduated top of my class with a 4.3GPA (not that smart though)
- Plain eater (just one topping is all I need)
- Dream car is a C7 Z06/ZR1 Corvette
- Mostly pick women in video games (it is what it is)
- 5’9”
- Black
- People say I have a Corpse Husband voice, and/or Cloud voice from FF7 remakes. You can be the judge of that cuz idk, lol


That’s enough fun facts about me for now.

All jokes aside, I’m not looking for perfection. Not at all. I’m FAR from perfect. I’m not the man I want to be right now. Not for myself, nor my family, but I want to try again. I just want people who are willing to TRY. I value that over any perfection. I don’t need to know your current status just to be a good friend or partner to you. I just want to get to know you and see how things could go. 

If you are interested, then DM me. Talk about one of my interests or your own. Whatever really. If not, I still appreciate you reading this.",3,1743351330.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False
1jnfxio,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1jnfxio/what_can_cinemas_do_to_pivot_and_thrive/,What can cinemas do to pivot and thrive?,"Quite sad that cinemas are having a hard time trying to stay afloat. I'm just wondering why can't they pivot and what do you think they can do? In my head, I can sit down and watch a movie at home. I don't need to sit down and watch a movie in the cinema. Home entertainment systems keep getting better.   
  
But as a movie theatre, they can offer cooler experiences and collaborate with other companies and stuff?

People going to the cinema used to be about bringing people together - but people don't have to go to the cinema for this experience anymore when they can watch movies at home with their entire families with pretty good sound systems and screens.

How can cinemas reinvent themselves?

These ideas from ChatGPT I think are worth considering:

Cinemas need to embrace the *experience economy*—people crave unique, social, and interactive outings, not just passive entertainment.

**Experiential Viewing and Social Elements**

* **Interactive Screenings** – Think *Rocky Horror Picture Show*\-style events where the audience can dress up, sing along, or participate in themed activities.
* **Escape Room x Cinema** – Before watching a mystery or thriller, audiences could solve clues to unlock their seats.
* **Themed Lounges & Bars** – Imagine a sci-fi movie screening where the cinema lounge is a cyberpunk bar with themed drinks.

* **Live Sports & Gaming Arenas** – Host major sports finals (World Cup, Super Bowl) or e-sports tournaments in cinemas.
* **Anime & Cult Film Marathons** – Nostalgia-driven events can be a huge draw for fans.
* **Murder Mystery & Whodunit Nights** – Watch a detective movie, then solve a live mystery in the theater with clues and actors playing suspects.
* **Trivia & Movie Bingo** – A pre-show or mid-movie game where participants score points based on in-movie events (e.g., “Every time a character says a catchphrase, mark your card”).
* **Scavenger Hunt Pre-Show** – A short puzzle-based hunt before the movie that ties into the theme (e.g., a hidden clue adventure before an Indiana Jones film).
* **Craft & Movie Workshops** – Watch an animated movie, then have a hands-on workshop where kids make something from the film (e.g., *Toy Story* = make your own toy).

**Corporate & Educational Collaborations**

* **Co-working Spaces by Day, Theatre by Night** – Rent out auditoriums as workspaces with premium coffee and high-speed internet.
* **Educational Screenings** – Hosting lectures, TED-style talks, or industry panel discussions alongside relevant films.

**Subscription & Membership Models**

* Similar to *Netflix for Cinemas* a monthly fee for unlimited movies could encourage attendance.
