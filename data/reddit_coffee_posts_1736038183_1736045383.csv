As the title says, I was thoroughly impressed by the quantity of La Marzocco machines. 

I live in Los Angeles where LMs are typically only found at your local, up-scale coffee shop/roaster. Whereas in Australia, even the most modest street corner shop or airport vender had multiple LMs. After a week, I probably counted over 100 machines.

1htvoee,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1htvoee/do_you_guys_have_coworkers_that_get_offended_when/,Do you guys have coworkers that get offended when you simply ask them a question?,"Trying to not relay super identifying information but...there's a person that works at my Starbucks and a few at my old Starbucks back a few years ago, that seem to get offended and feel like you're questioning their authority or something when you ask a truly simple honest question or even when you're trying to be helpful.

Like if I was on bar and my coworker is on front and warming and a coffee/tea comes through. I've just gotten through a few drinks and I know they've been busy with register and warming so I go to start the coffee/tea and they kind of snap ""Um, that's my job."" Like.. ok that's cool! I was just trying to help because you're doing like three things at once but that's cool and all, so I say ""Oh ok sorry! Did you grab the milk already or do you need me to grab it?"" then they go ""Um yeah that's \*you're\* job. See, I don't move from my area. Everything over \*there\* is \*your\* job."" Like again...ok! I just....asked a question.

So I go over to grab the ingredient all while they're repeating like I'm two years old ""Yeah...that's your job. That area's you're job."" Alright!

I get that there are certain positions but again, I was just trying to be polite and helpful. At bar I am like 2 feet away from the hot coffee and tea area.

First time I worked at a different Sbux and was new, I had someone laugh at me for asking things like where we keep the cold brew, and how to make an iced cappuccino. Like when I was brand new. Acting like you get hired at Starbucks and get a download into your brain of all of the information you need.

I always think if I'm unsure of something, asking questions is the right thing to do because at least I'm showing that I \*want\* to do it right. 

But, to end my rant, why do we and our managers let some of our partners be jerks to other partners. People will say, ""Oh thats just \_\_\_! That's just how they are!"" Like, no? I'm sorry but I don't really see an excuse for this behavior. I don't care how long they've been there either. :/",1,1736045211.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

1htvlfc,https://i.redd.it/qtnj8x0y83be1.jpeg,Painted edges tutorial no one asked for,"So I've been really into painted edges lately (last few months or a
year :D) and I've been trying to perfect it, because agsjjdhdhh I love
it.

I have tried few methods, and since I suk at taking videos and pics
Imma try to explain in case it helps someone.

For all the methods below sanding the edges is the most important. you
gotta sand and when you think its enough - sand more, untill its even
and smooth - it has to be even and smooth!

First and cheapest and easiest is painting with it in one color with
acrylic paint. If I want one even color I do it with acrylic paint and
a sponge after I paint it and its dry I lightly send it down with very
gentle sand paper, this makes pages not stick and makes the edge very
smooth and looks like fabric made

Spray gun, with thinned acrylic paint this is very good method it
paints the paint in a very thin layer and pages wont stick, but good
guns are expensive.

Both of these methods can be combined with cutting out stencil and
using them to paint images

3. And the newest method I tried that you can see in the picture is
doing it with an inkjet printer.

You would need:

*an inkjet printer

*a paper that doesnt absorb color, it could be the backside of any
sticker paper or a plastic see through foil, like those that are used
for plastification

*book with smooth sanded edge

You would make the image and print it on the paper that doesn't absorb
color. Also when you are printing it, you want the setting to be for
glossy paper, this will make the printer print very slowly and the
colors wont smudge.

When the printer is done painting, you want to pull the paper
carefully or you will smudge the image with your fingers.

You would need to have a very steady hand, I personally as a smoker
and heavy coffee drinker struggle with this, but good luck to you.

Place a light light light layer of glue on the book edge very light
and water-down, this makes the image have more vibrant colors on the
book edge. Make it light so that you can crack the edge after. Without
this step I have noticed that the image turns out very light in color.
But it is good if you want just the draft of your image on the edge so
u can hand paint over it.

If you have patience leave the image to dry for like few hours, this
makes the chances of it smudging on the book lower. The glue on the
edge should dry so that it doesn't disolve the paint and make it
bleed, but not completely dry so that you dont feel it under your
fingers.

Pros and cons of the paper you print on:

printing on the back of the sticker paper has lower chance of the
bleed on the book happening, but it is more difficult to get the image
precisely in the place you want it- since you cant see through it, it
is good if its a large pattern on the image because then you don't
have to worry to get it as precise on the book.

printing on the plastic foil is good because you can see through the
foil and and get it just right on the edge, but the foil doesnt absorb
paint even a little and if you dont wait for ink to somewhat dry it
will smudge on the edge.

So try both let me know what worked for you, maybe we can perfect the
method together.

Very important thing when you press the image to the edge, steady
hands steady hands, and not moving it up or down or smudging it, put
it on and once you press it theres no going back. It is difficult but
possible, if you have someone you trust they can help press the image
while you hold it or maybe you have 3 hands that could also work. I
dont have someone to press it with me so i just pray :D.

Sometimes some parts wont transfer , but if its a small part you can
fill it in with some other method brushes, pencil whatever.

P.S I also tried printing on the sticky side of the paper (dont do
this, or you would have to print on a white paper few times to clean
your printer inside-it dirties it.

We recently went to Ireland, Scotland and really Rome and wanted to incorporate pictures of them into our space. 

Not sure about the layout being too busy, but if we were to get them should they be hung across the top or in a triangle pattern. I would also be okay moving the coliseum out altogether and just flanking the tv with Ireland (left) and Scotland (right)

We were thinking book shelves on either side of the TV as well, which might affect layout of pictures 

Should the shelves be low? High? Long in width? Or something different altogether?

Some sad news lol. My coworker crush (28F) is leaving, with next week being her last. Over the past year, we‚Äôve had several 1:1s, and she‚Äôs been a huge help to me at work.

1htvcpi,https://i.redd.it/rsrnef6p63be1.jpeg,Review of our week in Sedona at Christmas time 2024,"I figured I‚Äôd share my review of wife and I spending a week in Sedona during the week of Christmas. 

We‚Äôd never been to AZ prior to this. We stayed at a VRBO one block from Uptown and it was lovely. Rustic and cozy but modern. Fantastic view from our room of the red rocks. 

The average temp in Sedona during that week is 57 degrees Fahrenheit. So we were a bit concerned that it could end up being quite cold, and that we could even have snow. We chose the location in part because it‚Äôs a warmer than average location in the US for this time of year. 

Fortunately the weather was just spectacular. For the first four days it was in the mid 60s. Lots of folks walking around in shirt sleeves and shorts. And the last three days it dropped to mid to high 50s‚Äîwhich surprisingly we actually liked a little better since the combination of cool air and warm sun was invigorating. I was perfectly comfortable doing some fairly easy trails on those days wearing sweat pants and just tee short and a light sweater. We had beautiful sunny weather with some clouds the entire time. We were treated to an especially gorgeous sunset on Christmas Eve. 

We didn‚Äôt plan a single thing beforehand. But since we planned to visit the Grand Canyon, once we arrived we decided to book a ‚ÄúGrand Canyon train tour‚Äù via a well known travel site. The description online made it seem to us naive first-time travelers that the 11 hour excursion would be mostly aboard the train‚Äîwhen in fact the train ride was just a two hour-ish leg of the journey to get to the south rim that in hindsight we could have done without. Regardless, the guide was very likable and we did have a great time overall. She took us to some spectacular views of the south rim and explained the geological theories of the canyon, etc. 

The Grand Canyon is of course visually mind-blowing. It is indeed ‚Äúmust-see.‚Äù But somewhat surprisingly we were more impressed with the natural beauty of the red rock formations in Sedona and the surrounding area. Throughout the entire stay we continually commented just how beautiful and stunning the red rocks are. Their details change depending on how light and shadow strike them, sometimes subtly and sometimes dramatically. So throughout the day there‚Äôs a slightly new way to appreciate their beauty. To be reminded that Nature can make scenery this sensational is exactly what our psyche needed. We literally never stopped marveling at the views. 

We didn‚Äôt book any tours for the canyon trails, we just drove to the trail heads, paid the $5 for the day, and walked the trails for a good while to get some incredible photos. We just did a few trails that are easy to moderate like Bell and Boynton, etc. If we ever return we‚Äôll definitely check out the others we didn‚Äôt get to. There‚Äôs about seven of them that are very close to where we stayed if I recall correctly. But anyway, we were perfectly content just driving to the trail heads and taking in the physical beauty around us.

So I would say that the main thing that this stay offered was stunning scenery. That exceeded our expectations. It never got old for us. In fact the appreciation increased over the week to savoring the views versus the immediate psychological almost otherworldly impact of seeing it for the very first time when driving in. (Haha, like ‚Äúwhoa, is this even real?‚Äù)

The second main thing of value for us was the dining. It‚Äôs a tourist town so we were prepared to spend a fair bit for the fancier places to eat. Sedona has some damn good restaurants. Highlights were:

- Mariposa - ‚ÄúLatin inspired‚Äù modern American; we went on Christmas Day at sunset in their outdoor area to a beautiful sunset with plenty of heaters and were perfectly comfortable, the filet mignon was off the chain; had a the bonus of a great chat with the couple next to us; this was a peak dining experience

- Elote Cafe - superb southwestern cuisine; great ambience, they actually managed to seat us without a reservation during a busy time

- Hudson - modern American; wonderful ambiance, great dishes, incredible view, great service

- Shorebird - modern American; maybe a just a smidge too gourmet for our taste in that we found the flavors complex and subtle whereas we‚Äôd rather be wowed with punchier flavor profiles, but we were still happy with what we chose

- The Coffee Pot - classical American breakfast; we thought about some more gourmet places for breakfast but mainly opted for the traditional 

And even the less high end places we tried were quite good including Don Diego (Mexican) and the Sezchuan Restaurant. 

And the shopping is fairly good for a tourist town such as this, although we found the main items to serve as souvenir reminders of the trip we found off the main strip. Some delightful Oaxacan fantastical and colorfully painted ‚Äúspirit animal‚Äù figures at the Coffee Pot gift shop, a lovely small flower vase at the El Tovar (Grand Canyon) gift shop, and a mid-sized flower vase at Son-Silver-West Galleries. Just memento stuff but things we‚Äôll definitely value.

Anyway, it was a wonderful time. It exceeded our expectations. We‚Äôre thankful for our time Sedona, we hope to make it back one day!",2,1736044194.0,Sedona,0,1.0,False

Things that have helped:
WATER!! At least 1/2 oz per lb of body weight (I'm 140 and drink at least 90 oz)
EXERCISING - keep it light(er) and simple
ANTIHISTAMINES!!!
B-COMPLEX VITAMINS!!!
VITAMIN D, K, E, AND FISH OIL!!!
HYALURONIC ACID SUPPLEMENTS!!!
SLEEP!!! 7-9 HOURS (unless you're a teenager, then shoot for 8-10)
STEAM!!! Opens pores to help them purge
- Dry eyes: Optase eye drops
- Chapped lips: Jojoba or olive oil after steaming, followed by your favorite lip balm (I like shea butter and/or coco butter more than petroleum)
- Dry hair & skin: right out of the shower, apply an oil like jojoba, olive, almond, castor, sunflower, etc. I'm allergic to coconut but it's another great one for most people. 
Insomnia/anxiety: If it's legal for you, THC gummies helped me a lot with my sleep issues.

Things that made it worse:
- Al-coholic beverages. Just don't. 
- Sweets & junk/fast foods - get your fats and sugars from fruits, nuts, & vegetables as much as possible. If you eat like garbage, you'll feel like garbage. 
- Not exercising - move your body to keep your lymphatic system circulating! Sweat! Pump some oxygen to those sore joints! Don't over-do it, but don't get too sedentary! Go for a brisk walk. Pick up some light weights. Do some yoga. Get a massage if you hurt too much to move much on your own. BUT DO NOT SIT STILL ALL DAY! I've managed my fibromyalgia pain with diet and exercise for THIRTY YEARS!! Trust me!!

Morning:
Steam face with a hot, wet washcloth for 2 minutes, gently rubbing away any dead skin when tolerable. Then apply Baby Eucerin Eczema Cream (and sunscreen if I plan to go out at all) 

Drink Coffee w/ 1/2 of a protein shake 
Take: Morning Dose (20mg), Claritin, Fish oil, Vitamin E, Vitamin D&K (all oil soluble) 

Breakfast: either (1 srvg. full fat plain yogurt w/ Omega trail mix) or (1/2 an avocado on an English muffin with everything bagel seasoning) or (everything bagel with cream cheese) 
Chug a 30 oz Stanley cup of water 
Drink an energy drink

11:00 AM
Take: Vitamin C, liquid B-complex, hyaluronic acid (can add any other water soluble supplements and/or ibuprofen as needed) 
Lunch: high protein, high fiber, low fat (1/2 cup of lowfat cottage cheese and 1/2 cup each of raspberries and blackberries) or (salad with grilled chicken) 
Chug a 30 oz Stanley cups of water
Drink a Joyburst (great for magnesium & potassium if you can find them in your area!) or other uncaffeinated drink.

6:00 PM
Weightlifting or hiking/walking briskly for an hour 
Chug a 30 oz Stanley cups of water
Dinner: meat & veggies
Take evening dose w/ Vitamin E

Honestly I don‚Äôt even know if thats a red flag or not. The main reason I‚Äôm kinda nervous to meet him is hes a pretty nice guy, and he said he‚Äôll be gentle and take it very slow with sex which I appreciate but hes like 280lbs of solid muscle, so its kinda scary being with a guy that bigüòÖ. 

Anyway am I being irrational here or what should I do?

E.g. fill, steep, release, refill, steep again etc. 

Hey guys, so I bought two bags each of this coffee before I headed home to Europe over Christmas. When I travel alone, I usually just bring my small clever and c40 with me. Because I traveled with my wife I brought the aeropress so I can do the bypass recipe from J.Hoffmann where you grind quite fine (14clicks on c40), then add 240g for 3.5min, drain and then top up with another 160g. The coffees were fine. Nothing special however and I definitely couldn‚Äôt taste any of the tasting notes. I tried different grind settings and also different recipes. The J.H. One was definitely the best tasting I could get out of the AP for a two cup morning brew. Yesterday arrived back home in KL where I made a 2 cup v60 (also from J.H. Described in his book) and was blown away by the fruitiness from the Kenyan coffee. It was just day and night- like it was a different coffee. 
I don‚Äôt want to buy the big clever just for the travels with my wife and was wondering how I could get a 2cup brew out of the 1cup dripper when traveling and no gooseneck kettle is available. ",3,1736043597.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve got some sad news. My coworker crush (28F) is leaving, with next week being her last. Over the past year, we‚Äôve had several 1:1s, and she‚Äôs been a huge help to me at work. She‚Äôs brilliant, strong, confident, and incredibly smart‚Äîpretty much everything you could ask for. So, when she told me she put in her two weeks' notice, I was naturally devastated.

I decided to do a pre-goodbye, and we talked about whether we‚Äôd keep in touch after she leaves. It was funny because she called me dramatic for saying goodbye, even though she mentioned we could still talk. But one thing that threw me off during our conversation was when we were walking, and I glanced at the ground while saying something like, ""I‚Äôll miss you."" I happened to catch the corner of my eye, and I noticed her head snap toward me, like she was surprised or maybe even a little confused/weirded out maybe? I couldn't tell tbh. I didn‚Äôt look at her directly, but her reaction definitely caught me off guard.

I was a little surprised by her response. It seems like everyone else at the company has said something similar to her, but her reaction was different‚Äîalmost like she didn‚Äôt expect it. What do you think? Should I take this as a good sign or a bad one?

To continue the conversation, we talked about her plans to move closer to her family(Ill be in New York she will be in Boston), and she mentioned that we could still keep in touch since I have her number. I don‚Äôt actually have her number yet, but I plan to get it next week. I was thinking of asking her if she‚Äôd like to grab coffee sometime and chat a bit more.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong- my regular friends are so amazing, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for the world- but often times it can still feel isolating when you‚Äôre surrounded by comparatively healthy folks. And as we all know, loneliness can lead to a nasty depression. 

The chronically-ill crowd catches a lot of flak and is regularly misunderstood by both peers and professionals. The stigma surrounding our conditions is something we have to face every day and it is actively harmful and invalidating. So please, if you have any remarks that may be snideful, prideful, or bigoted, consider sitting yourself in a corner instead of posting here. 

Knowing that fatigue is an enormous obstacle for many of us, I want to be realistic and flexible in arranging meet-ups or even just in exchanging messages. Things can take longer for us, including developing friendships and socializing.

### 1. **Listen Fully**
   - Turn off distractions. Become a human sponge for their words, not a human brick wall. You might even catch some wisdom along the way!

### 2. **Nod and Use Affirming Sounds**
   - A simple ‚Äúmmm-hmm‚Äù or a nod can show you‚Äôre really there. Bonus: Throw in a dramatic nod for extra effect‚Äîwho knew empathy could look like a slow-motion movie scene?

### 3. **Mirror Their Body Language**
   - Subtly reflect their posture. Just don‚Äôt get too carried away; this isn‚Äôt a dance-off!

### 4. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**
   - Encourage them to share more by asking, ‚ÄúWhat was that like for you?‚Äù Think of it as trying to open a jar of pickles‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want to just crack it, you want to get the whole thing off!

### 5. **Share Your Own Experiences**
   - Relate to them with a personal anecdote. Remember, your ‚Äúepic fail‚Äù story might get them to laugh and realize they‚Äôre not the only one stumbling through life.

### 6. **Validate Their Emotions**
   - Use phrases like, ‚ÄúThat makes total sense,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can see why you feel that way.‚Äù We all want to be understood, like a cat wanting to be let outside just as it starts to rain.

### 7. **Use Humor**
   - Lighten the mood with a funny analogy. ‚ÄúDealing with that sounds like trying to fold a fitted sheet‚Äîconfusing and utterly frustrating!‚Äù

### 8. **Respect Their Space**
   - Take cues on whether they want close conversation or some distance. You aren‚Äôt a clingy lizard; give them room to breathe.

   - Relate over shared interests. ‚ÄúOh, you like pizza? Well, we can both agree that it‚Äôs the unofficial food group of college students!‚Äù

   - Help out without expectations. ‚ÄúNeed a hand? I‚Äôm offering free moral support and snacks‚Äîdouble whammy!‚Äù

### 20. **Offer Your Presence**
   - Sometimes just being there matters. Think of it as sitting next to a great movie‚Äîyour presence makes everything better!

### 21. **Avoid Solutions at First**
   - People often want to be heard before they seek solutions. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have all the answers, but I might have a few questionable karaoke tunes we can belt out!‚Äù

### 22. **Empathize with Humor in Tough Situations**
   - When life gets heavy, a well-placed joke can lighten the load. ‚ÄúLife is like a bad haircut‚Äîyou just have to own it while you wait for it to grow out!‚Äù

### 23. **Be Mindful of Your Own Emotions**

### 30. **Pay Attention to Non-Verbal Cues**
   - Tune into their body language‚Äîcrossed arms might mean they‚Äôre feeling closed off. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if we can unlock that treasure chest of feelings!‚Äù

   - Use laughter to navigate mishaps. ‚ÄúHey, remember that time I tried to fix my own plumbing? I became more of a fountain than a handyman!‚Äù

1htv0ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalAssistant/comments/1htv0ne/ma_vs_pct/,MA vs PCT ,"Hey Reddit,  
I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would love some advice. I currently work as a Medical Assistant (MA) at a family practice, but I‚Äôve been offered a Patient Care Technician (PCT) job at a hospital. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of both options:

**My Current MA Job**  
- **Pay:** $16.00/hour  
- **Schedule:** 5 shifts a week, typically 8-9 hours  
- **Location:** 2 minutes away from home  
- **Benefits:** I have to wait 3-6 months to qualify for benefits  
- **Flexibility:** The clinic is willing to offer half shifts for the days I need to go to class (I‚Äôm starting Anatomy and Physiology soon)  
- **Work Environment:** It‚Äôs a little slow and repetitive for me, but it‚Äôs easygoing and close to home  
- **Perks:** Food from reps 1-2 times a week, which is a nice little benefit

**PCT Job (Hospital)**  
- **Pay:** $16.80/hour  
- **Schedule:** 3 shifts a week, each 12 hours (I actually like longer shifts - less days to work)  
- **Location:** 45-minute commute each way (so 5+ hours of commuting between work, school, and home)  
- **Benefits:** Eligible for benefits just after 30 days  
- **Time Off:** With 4 days off per week, I‚Äôd have more time for school, which is a big plus  
- **Work Environment:** I‚Äôve worked in hospitals before (unit clerk, telemetry tech, and PCT), and I loved the fast-paced environment. I‚Äôm excited about this opportunity.  
- **Perks:** A coffee shop and a full cafeteria with great food options, which is a nice bonus

**The Dilemma:**  
I really like the idea of working in the hospital again because I‚Äôve enjoyed the environment in the past, and it‚Äôd be a nice change from my current clinic role, which is starting to feel slow and repetitive. Plus, the PCT job offers better pay, benefits sooner, and more time for school with the 4 days off. The only catch is the long commute (45 minutes each way), which will add up, especially since my school is also 35 minutes away.

I‚Äôm also considering the MA job's flexibility‚Äîhalf shifts when I have class‚Äîand the fact that it's so close to home, meaning less time spent commuting.

**Questions:**  
- Does the hospital PCT job sound worth the commute and longer shifts, considering the pay bump and benefits?  
- Will the 5+ hours of commuting per week (between work and school) be too much to handle alongside school?  
- Is the flexibility and proximity of my current MA job worth staying in a somewhat slower and repetitive environment?  

I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone has experience with this kind of decision, especially balancing work, school, and commuting. Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences you can share!",1,1736043178.0,MedicalAssistant,0,1.0,False

She said she never saw anyone to have absolutely no trace online, even through his family which she also searched. She knows he had a baby with another woman after they finished and that was a point of contention before they split. 
Fast forward to tonight, we were out for dinner and went to a pub for a few drinks afterwards. The night was going great and we were having lots of fun, the music was fantastic and that's something we both love. At some point I had to go to the bathroom and when I returned, she mentioned that she was texting another ex. 

He had seen a pic online of the two of us out and had messaged her saying she looked great and he hoped all was well with her. She then asked if I'd mind if she went for a cup of coffee with him (she wanted to ask him out for coffee) and I said to be fair I don't think I'd be overly comfortable with that and she said that's fine I won't ask. After awhile I wasn't feeling as lively as I was and I realized that I was feeling a bit defeated by her wanting to go for coffee with her ex. I want to make this perfectly clear, I wasn't loud, I wasn't angry, I didn't curse or say anything bad to her, I told her I felt a bit weird about her wanting to meet up with an ex and just wanted to clear the air about it and that it made me feel weird and uncomfortable. She got super defensive and started telling me I was overreacting, that she never actually felt anything for this guy and that she felt bad for him. I said that's fine but it still didn't dismiss the fact that I felt uncomfortable about the whole situation. She started to get angrier at me and started cursing, saying I was a dick and ruined the night and that I was totally irrational. I told her I wasn't trying to start a fight that I was just trying to be open and communicate with her about how I felt. Literally anything I said just made her angrier. Eventually, after trying to talk to her multiple times and getting shouted at I dropped it and told her to forget I said anything. She just sat there with her arms folded. Eventually, I just said ok, I want to head home and she started giving out again saying I ruined the night and nothing I could say would reach her or calm her down so I just got my coat said I was going home and left. About 5 minutes later I felt bad for leaving her there on her birthday night out and returned. I tried talking again only to be met with more aggression so I said right, I'm heading home, if you want to get a taxi with me you better come now and I left the pub. When I got outside she wasn't behind me so I text and said I'd wait for 10 minutes and if she wasn't out by the I would head home alone. She just about came out on time and we went home. 


She's upstairs now, I'm sitting in the kitchen feeling like crap and like I'm invalidated by feeling how I did.  I know for a fact if I were to be messaging an ex asking to meet up for a coffee, she would have an absolute fit about it. I mentioned as much to her earlier and that was met with aggression too. I'm feeling a bit lost right now and I guess I just needed to vent.

I came across ‚ÄúIced Biscoff latte‚Äù. I loveee cookie butter and Biscoff is my favorite. I tried to make it several times with different methods but I always end up with the same result. After the drink gets cold with the ice, you can taste some of the solid biscoff spread at the bottom of the cup. (I always use the smooth/creamy variant, not the crunchy)

Most of the recipe goes like this, you melt the biscoff spread on your espresso shot, get your cup, pour your milk then espresso with the biscoff, lastly ice. 

It was always a smooth drink at first but after a while when the drink is real cold, there will always be solid bits of the Biscoff. How to solve this? I really want to enjoy this drink. :)",2,1736042876.0,barista,3,1.0,False

I read somewhere that many millennials were misdiagnosed with ADHD where they may have actually been on the high functioning ASD threshold. I'm not sure what I would do with the information, but I have reasonable doubt. The way I process any information is always seemingly different than Neuro typical peers. Does that mean I'm just strange or eccentric? Or is it another notch on the totem pole of peculiar traits? My social ability is minimal and general conversation seems like a daunting puzzle with strangers or even acquaintances. 

There are some flags as an adult that make me question where I stand. And I'm thinking that I may have skated through life until now by ignoring the signs despite attempting to suppress the relentless stress, anxiety, and strange triggers. If someone turns into my car causing $500 worth of damage, then that's life and no big deal. But if someone slightly inconveniences me by using my coffee cup and leaves it dirty, I lose my mind despite 20 other available mugs (and I try to keep it hidden on the inside unless I can't). 

What do you do with the information if you find out as an adult? What was the straw that pushed the call to get tested ?

Do you keep the information to yourself?

I'm curious if it's worth going to get tested.

_____________

Additionally back story: My step son was diagnosed with ASD. He is high functioning and was tested privately and through the school system by a state/county youth psychiatrist(?). The school system almost didn't diagnose him officially because he did well and ""typical"" on some tests. Yet, he was speaking with clear difficulties and struggled with many of the textbook symptoms of ASD. All that said, he has overcome many of the difficulties preventing his social interactions and school work. So I began thinking to myself on the relatable aspects to my life and growing up. Perhaps it's just all in my head. Maybe it's truly ADHD. Maybe it's Maybelline. IDK.

I'm 27 years old and when I was younger, back in HS, I was so fun everyone wanted to hang out with me and I had fun with anyone. Nothing crazy or wild, just a generally happy, silly person. 

Since then some things did happen to me that affected me mentally but nothing grave, such as death of a loved one, that would make me change so much. I'm seeing a therapist and, according to her, I am not depressed.

I genuinely just became so boring. Rarely anything people do on the daily (not talking about trips, concerts or some out of the ordinary stuff) is fun to me, having coffee with my closest friends became dull and I can feel them pulling away and I don't blame them tbh. When we meet I talk about general stuff, how's work, your partner, and so on. But I don't have the will to make jokes, be playful, you know, just have fun. What's even worse, when I am with people I feel like my time would be better spent catching up on work or uni lectures. 

I know all this makes me sound awful but I also feel awful about it. I feel bad I can't be fun or carefree anymore, everything has to be so serious, it's like there's something in my head telling me my time has to be spent smartly. But then again, I can't remember the last time I laughed so much or so deeply or the last time I genuinely felt happy. I'm mainly neutral. 

I hope I've explained it properly, I'm struggling defining  but all I know is that this kind of thinking is making me also pull away from my loved ones and it sucks because they're awesome people. 

If anyone could offer any advice, I'd appreciate it so much. Thank you.",1,1736042740.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

The relationship really traumatized me, and I decided to take a step back with this guy because I didn‚Äôt want to take things out on him because he didn‚Äôt deserve it. He‚Äôs had some moments with me as well, but we are always usually willing to work things out. A couple of nights ago, I was at work and was craving another energy drink, especially because I wanted to keep drinking a lot of fluids due to being sick. I kind of hinted at him that I wanted another one, but he proceeded to talk about the video game he was playing. He told me he missed me, and I told him I missed him too, and that he should have brought me another energy drink. (When we first started talking, he brought me coffee to work almost everyday. That hasn‚Äôt happened the last month or two). He pretty much proceeded to say that he couldn‚Äôt walk away from his game because he would‚Äôve died and he can‚Äôt pause the game to bring me a drink. I got upset because he was essentially telling me that his video game was more important than bringing me a drink when he claims he wants to take care of me when I‚Äôm sick. I said something kind of rude, and asked him why he is so worried about a game at his age. He responded, ‚ÄúLet me rephrase. I was having fun playing video games with my friends and I didn‚Äôt want to bring you an energy drink.‚Äù And proceeded to saying he‚Äôs comfy at home and he‚Äôs not going out into the cold to drive 11 minutes down the road to get me a drink. I got pretty upset and said I really don‚Äôt think I want to work this out with you because I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll always be there for me when I need you. This happened the other night as well when we argued, he left, and when I asked him to please come back, he said he was comfy and wasn‚Äôt going back out. I could‚Äôve went to his apartment for sure, but I only have a month left here until I move and want to soak it up.. plus I don‚Äôt like his apartment, there‚Äôs not as much space. Idk, maybe I‚Äôm being selfish. 

I guess it‚Äôs not so much the fact of me wanting the dumb drink. It‚Äôs the principle of WHY he didn‚Äôt want to bring it.. when he used to buy me coffee all the time when I never asked him to. It‚Äôs like they always try so hard in the beginning. He also goes out with his friends to bars often on weekends.

","When I met my partner, I was an extrovert. When I stopped drinking due to mental health decline- and to ultimately try and ‚Äúsave‚Äù my relationship- I became incredibly introverted. I am uninterested in going to the bar, but accompany my partner almost every weekend- 2-3x a week to hang out with ‚Äúour‚Äù (his) friends. 

I live in a small town where the only thing to do at night- is go to a bar. He frequently gets upset if I am 1. Not enjoying myself at the bar/leave early due to anxiety attacks or mental exhaustion or 2. If I don‚Äôt go in the first place 

He tells me that I need to come up with activities to do, because being at home/not socializing is not meeting his needs, and he wants ‚Äúhis girlfriend‚Äù to go out with him. When I respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to a bar‚Äù he gets frustrated and states ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt have to be a fucking bar‚Äù and when I ask ‚Äúwell what else is there to do with your friends at night?‚Äù He will tell me that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs tired of making all of our plans to go do things‚Äù, but offers no insight to any activity other than going to a bar. 

He feels like it should be ‚Äúeasy‚Äù for me now that I am a year sober, and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot that hard‚Äù to chill for hours watching drunk people talk in circles because ‚Äúhe went sober once‚Äù. He frequently tells me that I can ‚Äújoin in‚Äù on two person *drunk* conversations that I have no interest in, but when I talk about something that interests me I am frequently talked over.

I feel insecure and unseen at bars. I don‚Äôt know how to meet in the middle, because if he‚Äôs at home- he‚Äôs glued to a TV screen, or his phone- and struggles to do any other activities due to his ADHD. So he just assumes ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what people do at home‚Äù 

Every time I try and explain myself he gets upset and talks over me, that I don‚Äôt understand and he‚Äôs tried explaining why it‚Äôs so frustrating that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt plan anything, or come up with anything‚Äù 

He talks so negatively about me, my mood, my interests, my wants. I‚Äôm starting to feel like he liked me when I wasn‚Äôt sober. Or he just lacks any awareness or compassion for how it actually feels to never be able to drink again without my life going to shit due to my inability to *stop* drinking once I start.

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm alone in feeling this way. I still feel like I have spark, and am fun! But he consistently points out that he doesn‚Äôt think I am- and everybody else thinks I‚Äôm in a bad mood all of the time. It‚Äôs hurtful, because I am blunt- and lack awareness of my tone at times. Ex: a question that I innocently ask out of curiosity is interpreted as rude because of ‚Äúthe way I said it‚Äù. Even after immediately responding with I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs the way it sounded, but it was not my intention! I am genuinely asking out of not knowing, and wanting to!‚Äù 

My friends all understand me, but he doesn‚Äôt. 
I‚Äôve found I have had to shift a lot of myself to try and fit in the ‚Äúnormal/correct‚Äù way he thinks I should be doing and saying things. I feel like he has this idea of how I should be ‚Äúsober‚Äù and I‚Äôm just not meeting it. I do not know what to do, and feel incredibly helpless. 

I don‚Äôt want to emotionally drain myself by just giving in and going out every weekend, or consistently planning excursions for us to do. 
I like the simplicity of my lifestyle. I like thrift shopping, getting coffee, going for walks, picnics, painting, and generally mild mannered activities.

How the hell does anyone maintain a balance or reach a ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù without sacrificing their mental health, or putting unwanted pressure on their sobriety. 

What do I say? How do I make someone understand how difficult this is for me?

I left the church years ago and now that I'm back in the town I grew up in (my parents still live here) my dad occasionally asks me if I'd be interested in going to one of their men's breakfasts (8am on a Saturday, no fucking thanks) but I'd go occasionally out of guilt.  I'm pretty sure he's hoping something will ""spark"" in me and I'll return to the church, but that is definitely *not* happening.  I don't want to break his well meaning heart so I've never told him directly how I feel.  After a few very awkward Saturdays attending out of guilt I finally said enough, I'm not putting myself in settings where my social anxiety is going to turned up, I'm wasting my time going to these breakfasts with shit food and shit coffee, with all the typical Fox News talking points during discussion with those sitting next to you, and I'm going to say no the next time he asks.

Fast forward to yesterday, my dad asked me if I wanted to go.  I said no, I was going to be up late playing video games with friends.  He didn't complain or guilt me, I mean he has to think at least that he's retired and I work full time so giving up a Saturday morning is not going to be very likely.

Later on today we were driving together running errands and he directly asked me if I'd want to go to church tomorrow with him.  I just said ""No, I don't want to go to a church that cares if you're gay, or trans, or if you have sex outside of marriage, or if you get an abortion.  I think those issues are made by man and that bible has very little to say about it.""  He of course says ""well the Bible does have something to say about it"" and I just said ""I don't see anyone worried about wearing clothes with mixed fabrics"".  He trailed off, saying well the New Testament says things about it (of course he's been indoc'ed on those talking points) and I didn't pursue the conversation any further.  I'm just sick and tired of the evangelical church and all the made up shit they all go along with.  Sorry dad but no, I'm not going to be an example of the returning wayward son and consider yourself lucky I don't rant and rave about all the absolute horseshit I was indoc'ed with and all the shitty things I've had to work through due to my upbringing in the church.

The silver lining, at least, is my father has NEVER been a fan of Trump/MAGA and saw it for the garbage it was from the very beginning, and he complains about the pervasiveness of it in his and other churches.

I know it‚Äôs not instantaneous, but i feel like all the feelings of satiety I had been experiencing before the trip are totally gone & the shot I just took hasn‚Äôt taken effect.  (Typically I feel the effects hit within a few hours.)

I know I need to rein myself in ‚Äî part of this is all due to stress and being tired and depressed that I‚Äôm alone again, but I know better than to just give in to the impulses and I know I need to feed my body appropriately.

I remember my days in San Francisco all too well. Lively and short days, with hustle and harmony. I used to work at a small gift shop, overlooking the Golden Bridge. My day used to begin at 7 in the morning, and end by 5. Everyone knew me as a broke guy who would work anywhere for some cash. What they didn‚Äôt know, however, was that I was a secret detective of one of the most renowned agencies in the world. I used to work all night and sometimes all day, solving murder cases. I was pretty successful, for not even one of my investigations ever went in vain. But this one murder case bewildered me. It left me scarred for life, not because of its horrific nature, but my own personal connection to it. Today, after 50 years, I still find it astonishing how much this case enhanced my career and destroyed my peace. Those days I was known as Steven Pauls, you might recognise this as a busy street in Los Angeles. Now I go by Abby. So today after so many years, I want to let the new world open its horizons to monstrosity. I did hope once, that this story would go to grave with me, but time changes. Now, as a rusty old guy, let me begin this story as a young man of 25, a weird guy from Boston.

**Chapter 1- Literally Blind**

I woke up at 5 that day. It was a cool day, with birds chirping. I made some eggs and a cup of coffee. I sat in front of the TV, and began watching the news. And came the same old boring headlines, featuring celebrities and influencers. That was when I first saw the disappearance of the most notorious designer of California, Jenna Johansson. She had swamp green eyes, blonde hair and an extremely fair complexion. She was the designer of luxurious clothing and bags, which sold for hundreds and thousands of dollars. Not to mention, her husband owned many companies. It was intriguing for me that time, because she didn‚Äôt look happy with the usual paparazzi. She looked distressed and nervous. What a bummer for her, bad photos amongst the fake perfect ones. The news flashed- ‚ÄòTHE DESIGNER JENNA JOHANSSON IN PERIL, HUSBAND BERNARD JOHANSSON ARRESTED FOR ILLEGAL BUSINESS IN RUSSIA.‚Äô And so followed her past story and supposed ‚Äòtraumas‚Äô, like when her bag sold for 150k and not for 200k.¬†

I left for another hectic day at work. By hectic I mean another day of scrolling through the internet, and working on my pending cases. Hours passed, and soon came the lunch break. As I was about to devour my food, a customer came in. She looked as old as me, with lucious black hair and haunting ocean eyes. She had a sweater on, with some japanese wordings. Typical. She came busting in, immediately rushing over to the counter.¬†

‚ÄúHello, are you Steven Pauls? I‚Äôm Ishita Anand, I work at the Ironing Store down the road. I was told to deliver these clothes here, by Lilly Mendel. Can I drop these here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh sure, why not. She said something about payment or stuff?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope, nothing. Thanks a lot Steven. Could please do me a favor Steven? Please turn on the news, I‚Äôve been following something for some time.‚Äù

I nodded, turned on the TV and sat by the counter while she went closer to the TV and listened to the news. It was about the missing case of Jenna again, this time with angry fans storming the jail where her husband was kept. But my attention swayed immediately to Ishita, whose eyes looked both nervous and invested in the news. She hadn‚Äôt even flinched a muscle, when suddenly she broke in the most stunning smiles I had ever seen. I gasped at the TV, and saw Jenna‚Äôs Husband drenched in sorrow and pain. I couldn‚Äôt hold my curiosity back.¬†

‚ÄúMs. Anand, why are you watching the news about Jenna Johansson with such curiosity?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just got invested, I guess. I mean, she‚Äôs a blabbermouth and psycho. Too obsessed with money and life of ease, without turmoil.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue that. But you‚Äôre no investigator, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, as I like to say, all evil comes from within, including the remedy. I‚Äôm somewhat of a writer myself, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could live with that. By the way, do you iron the clothes of someone less superior than Lilly Mendel?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre talking about you, Steven? Well, we could give up our morals this time.‚Äù

We both laughed and she bid me goodbye. I don‚Äôt know why, but she appealed to me. I was alone most of the time, and had no one to share my interests in disappearances and violence. Maybe I was not the crazy one after all.¬†

My shift ended, and I practically raced back home. Upon reaching, I hung up my jacket and lept on the bed, for now my tiresome investigations awaited me. As I went to the bathroom, I saw a shadow behind me. I looked behind me, and saw one of my colleagues, Jamie d‚ÄôSouza standing there.

‚ÄúJamie, I could‚Äôve killed you right now. What are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúFat chance. Well, I‚Äôve got some news. Jenna Johansson has been found, in a not- so- good state. You‚Äôre on the deck, Steven.‚Äù

I gasped. But without further ado, I immediately put my coat on and rushed out the door along with Jamie. We weren‚Äôt that close, because we would always compete to solve cases. Jamie worked undercover at the local coffee shop. He never really had a thing for ‚Äòfriends‚Äô, or anyone of sorts. I despised him for his lack of emotion in many cases, while he prided himself on it. Without any talk, we reached the crime scene, 520 Delbrook Ave.

It was a usual street, but not anymore. There were police vehicles around, and a large audience. I and Jamie made our way to the scene.¬†

It was a big car in its worst condition, along with blood stains around it. As we neared the trunk, we saw it. The body.

It was difficult to recognise that face, because there was barely anything there. The body was tied up with rope, and the mouth was sewed open. But the worst part was the eyes. Because they weren‚Äôt there. They looked like they had been carefully taken out, and the eyelids were sewed till the eyebrows. On her chest, there was a paper stapled to her clothes which read- ‚ÄúTHE ROOT OF EVIL‚Äù. In all my life, I had never seen anything like that, such hatred towards somebody, because the body did look beaten up.¬†

I gasped. Jamie looked at me with his lifeless eyes and muttered, ""What a shame.""",1,1736041289.0,story,0,1.0,False

Highlights included: 
-Fireworks two nights in a row! At NYE they served canap√©s and both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks in cute souvenir cups that said Happy New Year on them.
-Having the Haunted Mansion Bar to ourselves for 10 minutes during the last evening. Be sure to get the secret menu drink served in a Gargoyle! 
-The Moana live action show was exceptional. The set was incredible! Don‚Äôt miss it! 
-Our servers and room attendant were real gems and so kind! 
-Interactive trivia during dinner at Marvel was entertaining with a fun visit from Spiderman a separate time. 
-The Aqua Mouse was so much fun! Long lines for the most part but worth a ride. 
-Coriander and Sage were a hilarious duo and I loved seeing them. They do a great Indiana Jones reenactment called Choose Wisely and an interactive Jungle Cruise activity among other things. 
-Imagineering the Disney Ships - free one hour walking tour of the ship where you learn more about the details and artwork of the Treasure. This was very informative and enjoyable! 
-I really appreciate that the Christmas tree and decor were kept up through our cruise. We saw them taking the tree down when we were disembarking today. 

Top foods - 
-Chicken Parmesan and Eggs Benedict from Palo 
-Mickey Churro Waffles from Marceline
-Tamari and Honey Salmon from Marvel 
-Roasted Green Circle Chicken and Tagliatelle with Tarragon Cream sauce from 1923
-The Lamb Pide from the room service menu 
-Strawberry and Banana Swirl Softserve! 

Honorable mention 
- The best coffee and a tasty snack called Cornados from Falmouth, Jamaica 

Disclaimed about Coco: I‚Äôm from Southern California so have very high standards for Mexican food and the ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù/Texmex they had was questionable at best but I did enjoy the churros our last night. The ice cream sundaes were also acceptable. 

We also had lackluster seats so didn‚Äôt quite enjoy the Coco show fully. 

Overall - 7 days was the perfect length to fully enjoy the ship and not feel rushed to check everything out. I shared an Oceanview room with 2 friends with a Pocahontas theme and really liked the split bathrooms for getting ready. It didn‚Äôt feel too cramped Overall a highly memorable and fun experience!

How to prolong this?,"Since I first started menstruating, I have really struggled with bloating. Like in a typical cycle, I will feel great the first 2 weeks, be very bloated week 3 (like up to 5 pounds), menstruating (still bloated 1-3 pounds above actual weight), rinse, repeat.

I am definitely not pregnant. I recently moved cross country and the stress/change in routine is why I haven‚Äôt had any period since November. I‚Äôve taken a test to confirm and this exact same thing has happened when I‚Äôve moved to a new place before.

Bloating is incredibly triggering for my body dysmorphia. I already am not thin, but the higher end of a size of average body type.I also have a pear shape so already care most of my weight in my lower belly/hips/thighs. So you add 5 lbs of bloat to my abdomen and I look overweight/obese. It‚Äôs horrible for my confidence and puts me in a bad place mentally.

Everyday without pms/period, my tummy has looked flat. I‚Äôve been feeling good/confident about my body. I have tried birth control pills before and explained to my provider(s) that I wanted to skip periods. But when I continue the active pills, I will still have pms/bleeding anyway. It‚Äôs been explained to me that while some types of birth control prevent periods in some people who menstruate, that is not true for every person. And I‚Äôm evidently not one! I had a provider suggest low sodium but my diet is already low-moderate sodium. My bloating is not from excess sodium. I drink water and coffee which is a natural direuctic. I don‚Äôt really want to take direuctic/water pills because they cause increased urination and I already pee more often when I have my period. I feel like I‚Äôd never leave the bathroom if I took them when menstruating. I have tried probiotics that are supposed to prevent bloating, lymphatic drainage, nothing really helps.

So I am either looking for either #1 what alternatives are available besides birth control to stop periods? I have seen there is a medication, Norethisterone, but that seems to be aimed at delaying a period not preventing entirely.

OR, is there any other method to address bloating that has worked that I haven‚Äôt listed yet? I have been seeing recommendations about increasing potassium intake or drinking raspberry tea but haven‚Äôt tried that yet.

Sorry, this may be a bit long‚Ä¶

I (f37) married my amazing husband (m42) 7 years ago. We dated for 6.5 years before we got engaged and I was 30 when we got married, hubby was 35. I mention this because I'm from a small town in Indiana (less than 8k population) and it is normal for people to get married young, 21 or 22 yo. I am one of 7 kids (5 girls, 2 boys) and was the 6th in my family to get married. I was also the oldest out of all of the girls when I married, my sisters had all married by 24yo.

When my husband proposed, I was so filled with joy and love and I didn‚Äôt want to drag things out to plan a wedding. I knew that he was my forever and just wanted to be married to him. We got engaged in January and married in July. Our options for venues were limited because there aren‚Äôt many in the area so many people book 1 to 2 years in advance. In the end we decided to get married on my family‚Äôs farm. We were happy about this because it would help cut costs (we paid for 90 percent of our wedding with a bit of help from our parents) and it would help us keep the guest list small because the barn could only hold 100 people. It is a tradition in my family that all of the women pitch in (mom, aunts, grandmas and sisters) to help plan the event and DIY what we can to help cut costs. This is where the first issue came up. My parents and fianc√©e‚Äôs parents made a list of people to invite, keeping in mind that we were keeping it a small affair. They invited those close to them but kept their lists small to respect our wishes for a small event. Also, with the guest limit we decided not to have children attend the reception. We made this decision because A. I have 14 nieces and nephews just from my siblings. My husband has 10 and B. we wanted to have a full bar and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that with so many kids around. Two of my sisters were very upset by this because they wanted their children to be included in the special day. Funny enough, they both didn‚Äôt include children in their weddings/ receptions. We included the kids by having them at the rehearsal dinner and telling the parents that they could attend the wedding ceremony but not the reception. I thought that this was fair because all of my siblings live on the same street as my parents so they didn‚Äôt have to go far to drop off the kids with a sitter after the ceremony. We also offer to pay for a few baby sitters for the kids as well as order pizza, snacks and movies for them.

The second issue was that although my mom, aunts and grandma were a great help with the planning my sisters told me that they had all had lunch and decided that they weren‚Äôt going to help with the planning or DIY part because as I was in my 30‚Äôs I was an ‚Äúold maid‚Äù and that most of the things that we did for their weddings wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate for someone who‚Äôs getting married later in life. I have great friends and after I got over the initial hurt I had a great time with the planning surrounded by great women who support me.

Fast forward to the rehearsal dinner. I knew going into the day that my sisters weren‚Äôt on the best of terms with each other. I wasn‚Äôt 100 percent sure what happened as none of them wanted to talk about it and I had spent the past months busy with wedding planning. My sisters were all bridesmaids. Knowing that they weren‚Äôt on great terms with each other I spoke with each of them separately and told them to be on their best behavior for the weekend and they all agreed that they would. We get through the rehearsal and move over to the area for dinner. We had some games and a drink station to keep people occupied before dinner. We also had our photographer there that day because I wanted photos of hubby and I with the nieces & nephews.

Things started out great and we were having a lovely time hanging out with the kids and taking photos. The photographer asked all of my siblings and their spouses and children to gather so that we could take a group photo. I was helping to gather everyone and I commented to my now husband about how blessed I felt to have all of my family there and that I was having a great day. I turn back to the group just in time to see two of my older sister arguing and see the older one slap the other one in the face. I just froze. After a few seconds I just turned around and walked away. I ended up standing behind a barn where I knew I would have a few minutes alone to calm down. At some point I heard someone calling my name so I walked around the corner to see my Dad and Grandma. They could tell that I had been crying and asked what happened. I told them about what shall now be known as the slapping and they said that they‚Äôd handle it. I was promptly given a glass of wine and told to chill for another few minutes before pictures would resume. When I walked back to the group for photos I noticed that my oldest sister wasn‚Äôt there and that her husband and children were all gone. We took photos with the rest of the group, enjoyed a delicious meal and had a few cocktails before heading home for the night to prep for the wedding the next day.

Fast forward to now.

Remember I said that I was the 6^(th) kid of 7 to get married. Well the last remaining unmarried child in my family just got engaged two weeks ago! And it is my twin brother (m37) we‚Äôll call him James. I am so excited for him and his absolutely wonderful fianc√©e. She is a great person and I‚Äôm so happy that he held out until he found the right partner in Jessica (f35). I was so excited when they called to tell us the good news as he had kept it a secret from all of us. Jessica‚Äôs mother passed away 5 years ago and she called my mother to ask for some help with the planning. They got engaged just before Christmas and are planning on getting married this June. My mom was so excited to be asked and she planned a brunch for all of the girls in our family and also invited Jessica‚Äôs grandmas and aunts so that we could all meet and discuss the wedding. While at the brunch Jessica got the same speech from my sisters that I did. Since she‚Äôs older they don‚Äôt want to help. She pulled me aside and asked me if I‚Äôd be willing to help out and I let her know that I‚Äôm happy to do whatever I can to make her day special. We set a time to gather at my mom‚Äôs house the next week to start planning. The day before we were supposed to meet up Jessica called me and asked me if I could bring some photos from my wedding because my brother had mentioned to her that it was one of his favorite weddings that he had attended and he had a lot of fun.

We met a bit early at my mom‚Äôs house and I had brought a flash drive with our photos so we got some coffee and started looking through them. While we were looking through photos my oldest sister showed up and we didn‚Äôt realize that she was there. When we got to the rehearsal dinner photos Jessica asked why my oldest sister and her family weren‚Äôt in the family photos. I avoided the question at first but she asked again so I explained to her what happened at our rehearsal dinner. She thanked me and told me that she felt obligated to include myself and all of my sisters in her bridal party but was hesitant because my sisters have never treated her well. My sister overheard this and lost it. She said that I was just bringing this up to make her look bad when everyone knows that she is the nice sister. She has complained to our whole extended family that I have been telling lies about her to the bride so that I can be the star of the wedding and said that I have always been jealous of her because my wedding wasn‚Äôt nearly as beautiful as any of her 5 weddings. So AITAH for telling the bride what really happened?

I‚Äôve started a blog called **3AMDeploy**, where I document real-world IT issues I encounter and the solutions I come up with (usually fueled by late-night coffee and stubborn determination). It‚Äôs not a discussion-heavy blog‚Äîjust straight-up practical fixes, lessons learned, and occasional head-smacking moments from the trenches of IT.

I do not have much free time , but I'd like to post some experiences & fixes every week.

Honestly, don't know if the main goal is to vent out, or just to share some of my findings..

Here‚Äôs the idea:

* **Step-by-step guides** for troubleshooting and fixes.
* Focused on **sharing practical solutions** rather than debating best practices.

I‚Äôd love your input on a few things:

1. **What‚Äôs the #1 type of issue you‚Äôd like to see tackled?**
2. **Do you find a blog like this helpful for day-to-day sysadmin life?**
3. **Any tips for making the content more useful or engaging?**

The goal is to make it a go-to resource for sysadmins looking for quick, practical answers to IT headaches‚Äîdelivered in a relaxed, relatable tone (because who doesn‚Äôt need a laugh during work hours?).

Thanks in advance for any feedback, ideas, or even just a quick opinion on whether this sounds useful!

1httyv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetFitnessMembers/comments/1httyv6/some_thoughts_on_how_to_lose_body_fat/,Some Thoughts On How to Lose Body Fat,"Tons of new people at the gym and on this reddit asking questions about how to lose weight. Here‚Äôs a post with some tips and tricks on how to lose body fat.

***TL/DR:*** To lose body fat you must be in a calorie deficit. This is easiest to accomplish by restricting calories. Use an online calculator to identify how many calories you need to eat to lose weight. Aim to lose no more than 0.5% of your bodyweight per week. You can also slowly and gradually make healthy changes to your current diet, which is easier for some. Beware of diet fatigue as you can‚Äôt perpetually lose body fat forever, this is where most people fail. Insert maintenance phases where you‚Äôre not gaining or losing weight so you can rest for a few weeks before hitting another fat loss phase.

# Create a Daily Calorie Deficit.

If you burn more calories than you consume, you‚Äôll lose weight. It‚Äôs the law of thermodynamics. The rest of this post is just details. In this post i‚Äôll make repeated references to bodybuilding but that‚Äôs just because that‚Äôs my background and bodybuilders have cracked the code on how to lose fat, these principles applies to everyone.

# Diet Is The Way (to a Sustainable Calorie Deficit).

It‚Äôs far easier to lose body fat by limiting calories than by trying to out-exercise a high calorie diet of twinkies. In fact, you cannot out-exercise a poor diet. Period. Though I would not recommend it, you can also lose weight without exercise.

Your basal metabolism (calories used to keep your body running) is where you‚Äôre going to burn the vast amount of your calories. Even 1 hour of hard exercise doesn‚Äôt really burn that much in comparison to your basal metabolic rate. The saying that ‚Äúabs are made in the kitchen‚Äù exists for a reason.

# Choose Your Strategy: Count Calories.

Figure out how many calories you need to lose, maintain, and gain weight. Just use several online calculators to start with and compare numbers (they should be pretty similar). That‚Äôs the easiest way (google ‚Äúcalorie calculator bodybuilding.com‚Äù and you‚Äôll get a few good results). If you don‚Äôt have internet access (then how are you reading this?), you can also use the following rough formulas:

* Calories to Lose Weight = your current body weight x 12¬†
* Calories to Maintain Weight = your current body weight x 16
* Calories to Gain Weight = your current body weight x 18

From here, plan your calorie intake to match the restricted calories and you‚Äôll be in a deficit. There are plenty of diet apps and recipes online that have breakdowns for calories and macro-nutrients. I am not going to go into various diets as this is highly personalized but I‚Äôll have some other tips below. I personally track all of my nutrition in a spreadsheet, but that‚Äôs me and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that for most people.

# Another Strategy: Modify Your Diet Without Counting Calories

For many people, counting and tracking calories can just be too much work. Another strategy is to just slowly tweak your diet to be more healthy one change at a time over the course of weeks and months.¬† For example:

* January: Replace sugary soda with sugar free soda; replace morning cereal with healthy cereal; no junk food snacks on Mondays and Wednesdays.
* February: Cut back on alcohol; eat two pieces of fruit each day; no junk food snacks on Tuesdays and Thursdays also.
* March: Junk food is only okay on Friday and Saturday evenings; switch out sugar in your coffee for stevia or whatever.

Your changes need to be enough so that you see results (and stay motivated) but not so drastic that it‚Äôs hard to maintain for the rest of your life.¬† This type of diet modification is more art than science whereas¬† calorie counting is more science than art.

# And More Strategies‚Ä¶

There are also other strategies like the hand method for portion control.¬† This means that for every meal you aim to get the following: ‚Äúpalm size‚Äù for protein, ‚Äúfist size‚Äù for grain, ‚Äúcupped hand‚Äù for fruits and veggies, and ‚Äúthumb size‚Äù for healthy fats.¬† For this, you gotta be aware of potential hidden calorie bombs like sauces that are rich in fats or high in sugar. The average person grossly underestimates calories. No cap for reals. ¬†

# Diet Fatigue is Killing Your Diet Gainz.

*This is the 2nd most important takeaway from this whole post. Beware of diet fatigue. The hidden killer of most new years resolutions.*

So you‚Äôve successfully gone into a calorie deficit and cut body fat for 8 to 12 weeks? Take a break for at least 4 to 6 weeks.

Diet fatigue is real and apparently not a lot of people understand it (outside of bodybuilding circles?). Your body will start to fight back against you if you stay in a calorie deficit for too long. Once you hit a high level of diet fatigue, do not try to grind past it. You will lose; mother nature always wins.

Diet fatigue is when you‚Äôre mentally and physically exhausted from dieting. Your food cravings are up, will power is down, stress is up, cortisol is up, you hate the gym, you hate life, you have mood swings, you're tired, you weight isn‚Äôt going down so your frustration is going up, your sleep is horrible, you got no energy, you are fussy all the time. That‚Äôs because your body is signaling on all possible channels that it‚Äôs a CODE RED ALERT till you eat more food (that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt sleep, your brain is literally waking you up to go find food).

This is where a lot of people fail because they get too far into the diet fatigue hole and think, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶ dieting and fat loss just isn‚Äôt for me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm miserable‚Ä¶ how am I going to live like this?¬† I give up, lemme go get that Popeyes 12 piece family bucket (spicy, not regular, with extra biscuits and curly fries plus blacken cajun sauce) and two Dairy Queen Blizzards (Choco Brownie Extreme and Oreo Cookie, plz)‚Äù

Now say with me, guys and girls: You. Cannot. Grind. Through. This. The more you grind the worse all of the symptoms of diet fatigue will get till you break and wake up with General Tso‚Äôs Chicken sauce all over your face, pillow, and other parts of your body (this is a Judgment Free Zone). This is why even professional bodybuilders going to sub 5% body fat don‚Äôt diet down for more than 12 to 18 weeks. For us mortals, I‚Äôd recommend 8 to 12 weeks.

# Defeat Diet Fatigue with Maintenance Phases.

After 8 to 12 weeks, when you start to feel diet fatigue accumulate more and more, congratulate yourself and go into a maintenance phase. Eat so you‚Äôre not gaining weight or losing weight (use a calculator to figure this out), all of the bad stuff mentioned above will disappear pretty quickly. Stick to your current healthy food regime, just eat a bit more or maybe have an indulgence or two. Just don‚Äôt go crazy and undo your progress.

After a couple of days a lot of your diet fatigue will go away. Don‚Äôt be fooled. If you hop right back into a calorie deficit your diet fatigue will immediately sky rocket again. Instead, stay in maintenance for several weeks because there‚Äôs metabolic stuff going on in your body that‚Äôs taking much longer to recover from. A good rule is to go into maintenance for 50% to 100% of the time you were in a fat loss phase depending on how deep, hard, and long you went (no dirty jokes, please).

Once you‚Äôre done with the maintenance phase for several weeks, you‚Äôll be prepared to go back into a fat loss phase again and you can keep repeating as needed.

# Don‚Äôt Make This Suck Anymore Than It Has To.

Life is hard. Losing body fat is harder. Don‚Äôt make things even harder-er by making your diet suck, too. Your diet is a permanent change and you need to find foods that fit your calorie intake that you will enjoy eating now and in ten years. In fact, I personally don‚Äôt even call it a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù because I feel ‚Äúdieting‚Äù is something you do temporarily. I like ‚Äúnutrition plan‚Äù much better.

If you hate salads, do not try to create a diet with salads. This won‚Äôt last.

I love olives, cheese, baby carrots, and hummus. So when I‚Äôm on a cut to lose body fat, my go-to afternoon snack is‚Ä¶ olives, cheese, baby carrots, and hummus. It‚Äôs also my snack when I'm in maintenance and when I‚Äôm bulking. Lots of fiber, good fat, good protein, and easy to prepare. I look forward to it every afternoon and I‚Äôve been eating it for years now. Go find your version of olives, cheese, carrots, and hummus. This will take some planning and experimenting. That‚Äôs fine.

You want healthy and whole foods that are minimally processed. Preferably high in protein and fiber. You can follow whatever ‚Äúdiet‚Äù strategy or framework you want; keto, south beach, Mediterranean (can't believe I spelled that word right on the first try), paleo, intermittent fasting, etc. Meta-analysis studies have revealed they all tend to work since they all ultimately help calorie restriction so find what works best for you.

# This Is How You Stay On Track.

Adherence is about sticking to your goal.¬† Adherence to your goal is composed of several different elements that work together. Understanding them will help.

*Motivation* \- This is ‚ÄúI am excited and I want to do this‚Äù and this is what most people feel at the start of a new year. It‚Äôs like when you see a picture of you and you‚Äôre really out of shape and wanna change. You cannot rely on motivation alone. Motivation will come and go and it‚Äôs just a kick starter and a booster. I find motivation happens externally and is not something I can self generate.

*Will Power* \- This is ‚ÄúI do not want to do this but I am going to because I am committed.‚Äù This is when you know you have to grind it out. You cannot rely on will power alone. It‚Äôs a good way to get through hard periods but it isn‚Äôt a long term plan. Will power is a finite mental resource and using too much will power will increase the mental component of diet fatigue. Use will power selectively and rarely.

*Habit/Routine* \- You wanna get to a stage where a healthy diet is a habit and routine; just a part of your daily life. You‚Äôre picking healthy foods out of habit when you‚Äôre shopping, you‚Äôre doing meal prep as a routine on the weekends, it‚Äôs just part of your overall life, like taking a shower or hanging out with friends. I wouldn‚Äôt actually know because I don‚Äôt have friends. Anyhow‚Ä¶ habit and routine will save you when motivation and willpower fail.

*Planning* \- A little planning when you feel good will go a long way when diet fatigue is high and you feel like garbage. The biggest example is meal prep. A lot of people meal prep on the weekends so that when they come home super stressed on Wednesday night, they are less likely to eat an entire meat lover's pizza, two pints of Guinness, and top off that meal with an entire canister of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs ice cream (guilty).

Another example of planning is scheduling. Set a date for when you‚Äôll end the current fat loss phase and you‚Äôll have something to shoot for. When things get hard, you can look at that date and say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only three more weeks, I‚Äôve already done nine, I got this.‚Äù¬†

Ultimately, you‚Äôll usually be motivated at the start of a fat loss phase and get periodic boosts of motivation when you see progress (‚ÄúI can fit into these jeans again!‚Äù or ‚Äúwait‚Ä¶ is that an ab outline i see?‚Äù).¬† The rest of the time you want to rely on habit, routine, and planning. Then you can tap into will power only when you‚Äôre really struggling with a stressful day here and there.

# You Only Get Two of the Three: Cheap, Easy, Healthy

It‚Äôs really hard to construct a nutrition plan that is cheap, easy, and healthy. Good quality meal prep services are healthy & easy but not cheap. Fast food is (sort of) cheap & easy but not healthy. If you cook your own food it is cheap & healthy but not easy. Eating out can be easy & healthy but is not going to be cheap.¬†

Cooking chicken breast can be tedious if you eat a lot of it, maybe it‚Äôs worth your money to buy it pre-cooked. It makes meal prep a lot easier and that means you‚Äôre more likely to adhere to your nutrition plan. Pre-washed lettuce is more expensive than unwashed lettuce, but you don‚Äôt have to deal with the hassle of washing and drying, and the cost difference is marginal, so that‚Äôs a good value. And so on and so on. Figure out what tradeoffs are right for you. I don‚Äôt know anyone who does meal prep totally from scratch. If you‚Äôre already eating out a lot, a meal prep service might actually be cheaper.

# Random Tips and Other Nonsense

**My number #1 tip is to show yourself some grace and compassion and then hold yourself accountable.** You‚Äôre going to lose some battles, just don‚Äôt give up on the war. When it comes to nutrition, you‚Äôll have a bad day, a bad week, even a bad month, forgive yourself. Then hold yourself accountable by getting back onto your plan. Do not beat yourself up to the point where you give up entirely, this is the opposite of being accountable. You can make this change.

**My other #1 tip is to be strategic about your goals and avoid overreach.**

Do not be aggressive and try to cut 3% of your body weight per week, you‚Äôll sky rocket your diet fatigue and you‚Äôll just crash hard. Millions of people have started the new year thinking that this will be their year to lose weight and go all in and overextend themselves with unrealistic goals.¬†

The general recommendation is losing no more than 0.5% of your body weight per week because that is what works in the long term. How many people do you think read that but then say to themselves ‚ÄúNot me, dude‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to overachieve because I am all in and motivated. I‚Äôm going to do 3% per week. I‚Äôm different‚Äù¬†

Dude, you‚Äôre not different. Then late January rolls around and they are already toast from the diet fatigue and trying to go to the gym 6 days a week to do 2 hours of cardio. One day they just up on everything and wait to try again next year.

Bodybuilders who have experience with cut, maintain, and bulk phases can aim for up to 1% or maybe even 1.5% body weight loss per week if they are already chonky.¬† Very obese people can also lose more than 0.5% per week, but that‚Äôs not most of us.

Along the same lines, if your overall new years resolution is to lose 30 lbs, maybe you need to just focus on losing the first 10 lbs or doing a solid fat loss phase for 10 weeks and then pause for a maintenance phase. This breaks your overall goal into much smaller goals that are psychologically more manageable. If you‚Äôve just lost 8% of your body weight in fat over 12 weeks, you‚Äôve done well but your diet fatigue is probably going to be very high and you probably won‚Äôt be able to cut out another 8% of body weight in one go. Take a break.

Set short term goals such as dieting for 10 weeks or dieting till you lose 10 lbs. You can always keep going if things are going well after you hit those milestones. Set intermediate target weights or dates so you can celebrate success as you go.

**My third #1 tip is that you‚Äôre creating a new you. And the old you is going to die.** This is highly philosophical but a lot of people who lose a lot of weight and keep it off after several years will speak in terms of creating a new self or a metamorphosis; and having to let the old self go away or die.

This is because losing weight is part of a health journey that‚Äôs just more than calories, it‚Äôs habits and routines (seen above), you‚Äôll throw out old clothing and buy new clothing, your attitude and interactions may also change; and sometimes this even means your friends and support network will change. Some people will encourage you; others will try to hold you back because they don‚Äôt like the positive changes you‚Äôre making as it reminds them of their own personal failures so they are going to try and tear you down and sabotage you (wow, that got dark). You‚Äôre going to change for the better and that means letting go of your past self. Life is full of transition periods and this is one of them.

**Tip #2. Stress will prevent you from losing body fat.** Do whatever you can to lower the stress in your life. Maybe avoid getting into useless political arguments on reddit, for example. And get tons of good quality sleep. If you need help, just ask Gemini or ChatGPT for a good sleep routine and optimal sleep hygiene practices.

**Tip #3. You‚Äôre wayyyyyyy more likely to cheat at night.** Will power and motivation dip during the course of the day and you‚Äôre often more tired as the day progresses. If you know this, you can better plan. I always keep several boxes of low calorie ice cream in my fridge. On a hard day, I can doublefist Yasso or Nick‚Äôs low calorie ice cream into my face and know it‚Äôs only 200 calories, but it feels totally indulgent. This is where planning helps.

**Tips #4. Track your progress. I would recommend two things for tracking progress, getting a scale and getting your phone.** For the scale, weigh yourself consistently and routinely. I highly recommend weighing yourself in the morning when you first wake up (after you pee is okay), this is pretty consistent in terms of water weight, and then do this a couple of times a week. I personally weigh myself every morning as a matter of routine because it reminds me of the progress I‚Äôve made. Other people hate weighing-in often so this is really a personal preference.

Always compare your weight against the past week (7 days prior) and the week before (14 days prior). Do not worry about the ups and downs of your weight from day-to-day; sodium, carb bloat, gluten bloat, water weight, various types of inflammation, and gastrointestinal issues can impact your day-to-day weight too much. Focus on week-to-week progress. I log my weight on a physical calendar I made in google sheets.¬†

Your weight is one component but selfies are actually a great way to measure progress, too, especially when combined with weight. How you look is how you feel. Take pictures every week or every two weeks. Use the exact same outfit, exact same room, exact same set up, exact same lighting, and the exact same time to make sure your selfies are standardized like your weigh-ins.

**Tip #5. You can preserve muscle during a weight loss phase with strength and resistance training.** In a calorie deficit your body is going to pull calories from fat (that‚Äôs good) and muscle (that‚Äôs bad).¬† If you want to keep muscle, do some strength training.¬† When your body is looking for calories your muscles will say, ‚ÄúLolz. Don‚Äôt look at me, I‚Äôm actually being used‚Ä¶ go get calories from fat, those fat cell aint even doing nothing‚Äù and then your fat cells will say, ‚ÄúThis is my time to shine. Take me and use me.‚Äù

**Tip #6. Focus on foods that satiate and make you feel full.** This means lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean protein. Fat does make you feel full but you can easily overeat it if you‚Äôre not careful.¬† What‚Äôll leave you more full? Two heaping tablespoons of peanut butter or four apples? They are both 400 calories. That‚Äôs why fruits and veggies are so helpful (btw, you will also have to pry the jar of chunky peanut butter from my cold, dead hands).

**Tip #7. Carbs are not the devil.** Carbs are a good source of energy and have gotten a bad wrap in recent years. If you focus on good carbs then it‚Äôs totally fine to eat them. Again, lean on fruits and whole grains. Avoid snorting lines of refined sugar up your nose and you‚Äôll be okay. For example, potatoes are one of the most satiating foods ever.¬†

**Tip #8. It‚Äôs about consistency over weeks and months, not days. I**f you have a crazy meal and went over your calorie limit for a day, or a weekend, or a week then don‚Äôt sweat it. It‚Äôs not the individual days that matter as much as the averages over the course of weeks and months. Just get back on your nutrition plan as soon as you can. Don‚Äôt starve yourself to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for eating over your calorie limit the days before, either, this‚Äôll just spike your hunger and diet fatigue.

Okay, I'm gonna stop because this is already too long.

*Caveats:* I‚Äôm not a doctor, this isn‚Äôt medical advice, i totally just made this all up, if you have any questions don‚Äôt ask me, I dunno what I‚Äôm doing, man, i just want some Popeyes.

Title‚Äôs a little cheesy, but Casey knows how much I struggled with de-cluttering. Since we both have ADHD, I trust her advice more than most. The intro claims by following these steps, I‚Äôll have my dream house within a week. 

**Day one:**

Starting with the kitchen. The takeout containers I‚Äôve hoarded took up more space than I realized. By the end of the day, though, I couldn‚Äôt help but beam with pride at my now-alphabetized spices. 

‚ÄúBabe! Come look‚Ä¶‚Äù I said excitedly.Travis looked up from his laptop in annoyance. 

‚ÄúJesus, Kelly, how many times do I need to tell you not to bother me when I‚Äôm working?!?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said, deflated, ‚Äúbut I just‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúOh my god, don‚Äôt stay there talking at me‚Äîget out. Go. I need to focus.‚Äù

**Days two and three:**

The living room was a maze of unused exercise equipment and over-stuffed cardboard boxes, but once I started going through it all, it wasn‚Äôt that bad. I‚Äôd forgotten about most of this stuff. Casey and I spent the next day hauling boxes to storage and posting the exercise equipment to Craigslist. I‚Äôve already made $50. 

Travis was unimpressed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally cleaning like a wife is supposed to. What do you want, a cookie?‚Äù 

**Day four:**

 The bathroom; my least favorite. I got through it by reminding myself that after the deep-clean, it won‚Äôt take much to maintain. Did you know ibuprofen expires?! I had no idea that Travis took sleeping pills; must‚Äôve forgotten they‚Äôre there. Maybe that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs been grumpy.

**Day five:**

Most of the mess in our bedroom was laundry. Between loads, I tidied up here and there, clearing away coffee mugs and soda cans from my bedside table. Travis‚Äôs didn‚Äôt have clutter, so I decided to organize the drawers for him. I started by setting his laptop and charging cords on our newly-made bed, organizing the receipts, bills, etc. 

That‚Äôs when I found the pictures. 

My unconscious body being violated by men who I had never seen before. Tucked in the corner of the drawer was a wad of cash. 

I felt sick. 

**Day Six:**

‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta hand it to you‚Äîyou‚Äôve been stepping it up lately,‚Äù he said between mouthfuls of brisket, droplets of homemade barbecue sauce dotting my clean table as he spoke. ‚ÄúCooking, cleaning, all the stuff wives do‚ÄîIt‚Äôs nice to see.‚Äù

I said nothing, sprinkling Parmesan on my salad. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre even watching your figure now. Keep it up.‚Äù

**Day seven:**

Waking up to a clean house really is good for the soul.

The sunlight streamed in through my dust-free blinds to illuminate the clean walls, vacuumed carpet, and the blood pooling around my husband on our mattress. Those sleeping pills really worked; he didn‚Äôt even twitch until the knife was halfway in his chest. 

*Sigh.* What a mess. 

But I feel more than ready to clean it up.

""Tomorrow I'll head into Blue tower, call a buddy of mine and see if they know what happened. I'll tell them you escaped, and that Duncan died trying to catch you. If we can find some way to prove that those frogs are real‚Ä¶ then we can end those sick fucks in bison. We'll prove you innocent until then you need to stay out of sight."" Said, Mark. With both arms crossed, pacing the room.

¬†""Then I guess you'll be getting the coffee and the food?"" he said ""make it burgers tonight and pizza tomorrow,"" said Greg. Looking down at his arm. He sees the holes made by the frogs when they grab him. His chestnut brown skin now with pink bloody holes.

Mark sees his bloody arm and tells him to wait here. ""I'll get some first aid kits and the burgers. No coffee though we need to get some sleep. A milkshake will have to do, chocolate or vanilla."" Says Mark, looking at Greg who responds by giving him the finger. ""Vanilla,"" says Greg. Closing his eyes to sleep a little as the sun rises.

¬†As the kids wake up in the treehouse all on top of each other. Without a warning, Wily's mom burst into the treehouse and says. ""Wake up when did you kid get home. Why is everyone's mother calling me to check on their kids? Tell me where you were and don't say the treehouse. I checked here first tell me!!!"" said Jane.

¬†Jane's eyes are red with fire. She looks to her son for the answer. ""We went to the train cross and slept in the green cross fort. We wanted to see the green lights. You and dad showed them to me when I was a kid, I'm‚Ä¶sorry mom."" said Wily.

¬†As the fire goes out in jane's eyes, she holds her son and tells him everything's fine. With tears in their eyes, the two climb down, and the rest of the gang joins them.

In the kitchen after calling their parents to tell them what happened Jimmy, Eddy and Carly go home. Taking their bike's the twins ride off jane gives Jimmy a ride home.

The kids are all grounded its Saturday. Wily sits in his room wondering what will happen next. As if the god of drama and the boogie man teamed up to ruin his life.

¬†Wily's tv turns from a cartoon on channel three to a news broadcast. ""Breaking news, last night a police officer was killed by a fellow officer. As he and a suspected murderer are on the run from the police. The suspects are Greg Williams a homeless veteran with mental illness and an officer Mark G√≥mez. Who'd been with the station for two years and had been partners and friends with officer Duncan Short. The two men were like brother's says Short's family. if you have any information that will lead to their arrest please call the Bison police department at (576)555-5555."" said the news anchor Jill west.

¬†As Eddy and Carly sit in their living room with their mother and father, yelling at them about how stupid they were. Eddy gets the worst of it, he's a boy. They say he should be responsible. Looking at her brother trying not to cry, Carly stands up and yells back. ""I'm not a baby and neither is he we're fourteen years old. The reason we lied was that you would never let us see the green lights,"" says Carly with all the fury in her voice of knowing that her parents are mixed up with the frogmen.

Covering up murders and god knows what else. By the end all her mother and father can do is look at her. Then each other It's her mother who spoke first. ""Go to your room both of you and your young lady are not to see that Wily boy ever again. That goes double for you two Eddy,"" said Mrs. Stark

¬†With nothing else to say she watches her children go upstairs and turns to her husband. ""Nothing to say anything at all. You might be mayor Stark out there. But here you‚Äôre still a father and husband act like one."" said Mrs. Stark

¬†With a look on her face that made the mayor feel like a deer in the headlights he says. ""I love you and we're going to Cancun for our anniversary and Hawaii for Christmas."" With that Mr. Stark looks at his wife who rolls her eyes and walks upstairs to bed.

¬†Jimmy sits in his window looking outside, Hoping his father would be late getting home tonight. His mother told him if he behaved, she would tell his father that Wily's mother was mistaken. That he was at his cousin's house. Jimmy's father Kevin was in a rage last night and would have beat Jimmy bloody if he'd come home that night. But as Kevin's beat-up old tow truck pulled up, with the words junior's auto body and repair. As the engine stops the tall man comes into the house. With oil and rust on his face, he sits at a table and looks around. ""Is the boy here yet. Bring him out here now!!!"" said Kevin with a fist to the table.

¬†Kevin looks at his wife who exits the living room to get Jimmy. She brings him in and says. ""you'll never guess what he was at Lucy's house, not Wily's his mom must have been mistaken. Isn't that funny honey‚Ä¶"" says Jimmy's mother with a nervous smile.

¬†As Kevin shoves the warm pork chops and peas in his mouth he turns to his wife and laughs. ""So, jane must have been lying to me over the phone. But why would she lie."" He says As the smile leaves his face.

¬†Kevin stands up and says. ""Or maybe you‚Äôre lying. You see Lucy's Dad and I were working together last night. He didn't say anything about Jimmy being at his house. The text you showed me said he was studying with Wily at his house. Now I'll forgive you for lying if you leave right now."" said drunken Kevin with the smell of thick liquor on his voice.

¬†Brenda holds her son tightly with a grip that gives away the fear in her body as she waits for him to respond. ""Well, that‚Äôs how it is. You‚Äôre a good mother but a shit wife."" With that Kevin punches her and she falls to the ground. Seeing his mother fall to the ground, Jimmy attacks his father with all the anger that he kept bottled up inside himself.

As he hits his father repeatedly Kevin stubbles back. Then he grabs his son's fist. After a few moments, Jimmy's father leaves his son and wife bloody on the ground.

¬†He then leaves to get drunk. As the car pulls away Jimmy helps his mother off the ground, and she slaps him across the face. ""Why can't you just behave !!!"" she points a finger at his room and Jimmy storms off.

¬†Monday comes quickly and the kids all arrive at school as Wily walks up to Jimmy seeing his black eye and bruised face, he asks what happened. Without warning, Jimmy punches Wily and says. ""If your mom ever calls my house again, I'll break your legs.""

¬†As the two roll around on the ground kicking and punching each other as teachers separate them. Eddy and Carly both turn away from Wily and Jimmy. In one night, everything Wily loved had been taken from him. His best friend, his girlfriend, but she was his girlfriend. Wily had time to think he was detention and for the rest of the day. No one spoke to him, not Jimmy who he hated, or Eddy who hated him. It seemed not even Carly who he tried not to think about. As they sit in the motel Mark tells Greg about the meeting with his police friend. ""After the news bulletin, all my contacts in Blue tower shut me out. Only hank my uncle's friend in the records department would see me. He sent me to St. Mary's church a place police officers go to leave each other going away presents, in case one of us must leave town in a hurry. I found a burner phone with minutes and a note telling me where to meet him."" said Mark, feeling better than he had since he saw the frogs.

With a feeling that things might be getting back to normal rolling around in his head like he could go back to being a cop again. Not wanting to spoil Marks' good mood, Greg goes to the bathroom to shower and yells back to Mark. ""So how are we supposed to get food, and you know pay for this room. If the bacon patrol wants us both?""

¬†Over the last few days, Greg and Mark had become friends, I guess being wanted by everyone made it easy to become friends. Thinking back about the man who mocked him, now they shared so much. They both knew the truth; the kids knew the truth as well.

One thing Greg can't stop thinking about is the kids if there alive. He let mark send them home, to god knows what, and can't stop thinking about them. Every time he brought it up to Mark all he did was tell him the kids will be fine, safer with their parents than two strange men on the run.

¬†As the sun goes down Mark gets up to meet Hank leaving Duncan's gun on the nightstand, Mark tells Greg not to open it for anyone but him. Greg rolls his eyes and responds. ""Thanks, mom I promise I won't talk to any strangers, by the way, what about food?"" he said with a look of frustration on his face and arms crossed. ""Call the front desk and ask for something to eat. The owner's wife will bring you something and be grateful or starve your choice,"" said Mark.

With that Mark goes, keeping his face and head covered with a baseball cap and sunglasses. Looking like the kind of man on the F.B.I.'S most wanted list Mark jumps into the owner's Truck, the ford f-150 pulls out of the motel. He arrives for his meeting with hank praying it's not a trap.

""You're late."" says mark in the dark car garage with shadows all around him, with his truck parked on one of the lower levels, so he won't be followed in case this is a trap. But with hank standing in front of him Mark meets his gaze and tells him everything.

¬†""So, a group of kids can prove that these frogmen killed Duncan. Do you know how crazy that sounds, I've got a hundred thousand in unmarked bills in my car? Your uncle said he'd pay me back and I got two passports one for you and one for your boyfriend, next time just buy some ass it will cost you less and your uncle too."" said Hank.

¬†Laughing the bald old police officer short and hairy with liver spots all over his arms and bald head turns to walk away. Just then Mark feels a sting in his neck looking up at the bald man he sees him touching a ring on his finger, a black ring with jewels red and green blue and purple. The little diamonds were small and colorful. As his eyes close Hank just laughs.

¬†As he sits in the motel room a car pulls up. Greg thought it might be Mark he looks through the window and sees two men go to the office, a few seconds later he gets a call from the front desk. ""Your meal is ready, but you have to come to the front to get it, Ms. Hamm.""

As the line disconnects Greg pulls out his gun. That was the code the owner would use if the police officers came looking for them. Greg has no idea what Mark did for these people that they would hide from the police, but they were loyal to their friends and Greg will not forget that.

As he hides in the bathroom and turns on his shower the door to his room opens slowly. With the gun on the table, the two men walk in and grab it moving past the two beds. The plain-clothed officers walk into the bathroom, as one moves past the door Greg slams it shut on the other. Stabbing the first with a knife in his hand, the long knife goes into the police officer‚Äôs chest almost pinning his hand to his chest.

The other fires into the room Greg yells out in pain blood drips through the holes in the door. With that the second officer calls to his partner, Knowing he can't call for backup. The officer pushes the door open to see Greg holding a gun to his face. ""Drop it,"" says Greg holding the gun to his forehead and smiling.

""Let's talk about frogmen shall we,"" said Greg with a sinister wink. Taking his handcuffs and his partner's shield the two walked back to his car. Asking the police officer if there's anything he wants to say, the police officer tells him. ""In the trunk, I've got half a mill. It was for us to split but well he doesn't need money in hell."" said the frightened police officer who looked like he might piss himself.

¬†""No, but his family might, or is he single and fixed?"" Greg made a scissor cutting motion with his hand and looked at the police officer sideways.

¬†Pulling the officer into the owner's office, Greg can't believe that no one called the police officers. The interstate highway is a cruel mistress, or all these people are committing crimes of their own and don't want the law involved. Greg was starting to understand what Mark had done for these people.

After an hour and a half in the trunk of a car, Mark can cut through his ropes. ""That‚Äôs why you use zip-ties you dumb basted."" With his hands, free Mark moves quickly to unbind his feet. Knowing how close he must be to bison town. Then the trunk opens, and a tire iron hits him in the face, with that Mark passes out again and awakes hours later standing near the body of hank and two blue tower police officers, both from vice on top of him and a voice yelling. ""Did those ass wipes think we'd pay for one of them? The mayor said that one is going home with him."" said the voice ""which one."" said the other voice ""Gomez the Hispanic one."" said the first voice.

The two men were digging a hole, as they climb out of the hole, they drag the first vice police officer to the hole and toss him in. Then the grogginess starts to fade Mark closes his eyes and reaches for Hank's ring, pocketing the ring, keys, and wallet, while the bison police struggle with the bodies. ""Lift with your legs dumb ass."" says one of the police officers. The other responds with as much love as the first. ""Don't tell me how to do my job slime dick, I know you fuck frog‚Äôs nasty."" said the other.

¬†With that Mark crawls to the car gets up quickly and jumps into Hank's car, as the two bison police officer jumps out of the hole and starts shooting at the car Mark takes off. Checking the GPS and Hank's phone he sees the address of the motel. Mark puts the pedal to the metal and drives back to the motel, as he reaches the edge of town two police cars blocked his path out of town. Reversing the car, he is blocked again by a large black tow truck then hank's phone rings in Mark's pocket. ""Hello, who's this."" He said with a tone that gave away the fear in his voice.

It takes a moment for anyone to respond. ""This is mayor stark nice to meet you. Mark Gomez, can you step out of the car and talk to me face to face or not, you have ten seconds. Get out of the car and put your hands in the air."" said Mr. stark with that the mayor hangs up. Mark must choose, fight his way out, or give up. With no time Mark gets out of the car with both hands up. Then the man in the truck hit's him from behind. ""I'll take this one to the mayor's house he owes me money for the last job I did anyway,"" said Kevin the mechanic. With that Jimmy's father puts Mark in his car and drives off.

With the motel owners safe, Greg drives down the highway thinking of a safe place to go. After a few minutes parked in a breakdown lane, Greg heads back to bison, looking for Wily and the other kids who saved his life. With a hundred thousand dollars he kept for himself the rest he gave to the owners for their trouble. He only had whatever guns the police officers had on hand, which was a lot surprisingly. With that and the dirty police officer‚Äôs car, Greg goes back to bison town.

At midday, Jimmy and his father are at Kevin's auto body to work at the auto body shop. After two hours working alone in the shop Jimmy's dad tells him he's got company, standing before him is Wily with his worst overalls on. ""What do you want dick,"" said Jimmy turning to face Kevin, Wily responds. ""My mom told me I have to help Jimmy with his work. It's my fault he's in trouble‚Ä¶so can I help, or should I go home,"" he said facing Kevin and trying not to look at Jimmy.

""Go for you little shit but if you or my idiot son breaks anything, your mom is paying for it understand kid?"" said Kevin, not waiting for a response before sitting back in his chair.

With his boots on the hardwood counter, smoking a cigar Kevin then says. ""You two outside look for some good scrap. Jimmy shows him how to collect the scrap. But don't bring any crap back here or I'll tan your hide boy, that goes for you to Willie."" he said as he slams the door to the office shut.

With that, the two boys begin shouting through the discarded pieces of metal on the ground, inside the old scrap yard with Kevin not too far away in his office the two boys start talking. ""What are you really doing here asshole,"" said Jimmy with less anger in his voice than he'd had the day he attacked Wily.

¬†""I don't know why I came here after what you said, but you're in trouble because of me so let's just do this then we never have to see each other again. I owe you for everything that happened to Greg,"" said Wily, Wily stands With his back to Jimmy, fighting back tears as the weight of everything that has happened since first, they meet Greg hit's him all at once.

As Jimmy, seeing Wily on the verge of tears, reaches to put a hand on his shoulder his father calls out to him. ""You two dummies with me, Nick and Dash are out, and I got a job so let's go, girls,"" said Kevin opening a window in his office and yelling out to them.

¬†Heading to his car Kevin buckles up then honks for the boys.

¬†The parking lot where he keeps the cars, he tows is closer to the office than the scrapyard, as you must go through the office to get to the parking lot. With no keys to the locked office and his father honking, the boys climb over the five-foot chain-link fence that encloses the scrap yard. They jump in the truck Kevin pulls out, not waiting for the boys to buckle up. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

As the sun goes down Kevin pulls into the empty parking lot. It's the radio station. Seeing the black sedan Kevin walks up to the abandoned car as boys are told to stay in the truck. Jimmy's father walks up to the car with its hood up and white smoke rising from the car's engine.

Kevin sticks his head under the hood he feels a gun against his face. ""I think I may have a flat tire."" said the man holding the gun as Jimmy and Wily see Jimmy's father with his hands in the air, the two boys' run to his side and see Greg holding the gun.

¬†""What the fuck!!! I saved your life, and you want to kill my dad Greg,"" said Jimmy with his blood pumping and head spinning from the stress, after hearing this Greg relaxes his grip on the gun. Seeing this Kevin tries to grab the gun and is shot in the shoulder. Both Wily and Jimmy yell for Greg to put the gun down and then he tells them what happened. ""This guy was the one who covered up the for the frogs he and the cops in town are working together. It was junior's auto body and repair, which was the name of the tow truck that covered up the prison van crash,"" said Greg holding the gun over the bleeding and injured Kevin who yells out in pain.

¬†""You two‚Ä¶you‚Äôre the kid who helped him and that cop‚Ä¶goddam-it boy does you know what they'll do if they find you."" As tears roll down Kevin's face, he looks at his son and thinks of his wife.

""Your apart of this you work for the frog's dad, you kill people,"" said Jimmy choking up, as if his throat was full of bile. Falling to the ground unable to hold back the pain of knowing how evil his father truly was.

""Listen to me you have to get your mom and get out of town. Leave now there looking for you four, one of the frogs saw you and the new lord. Their boss I think or ours can talk to them. There's a bounty for all of you I just collected the one for the police officer. I had to split it with the local pigs."" said Kevin coughing up blood dying slumped against the sedan.

¬†""What's happening to him did you kill my dad,"" said Jimmy as he wipes away tears and wraps his arms around his father.

¬†Greg angry pushes Jimmy out of the way and tells him. ""Your dad's not dead he's drunk, and the blood loss isn't helping any, now move so I can save the man who tried to kill me.""

¬†After bandaging Jimmy's father and checking his tow truck, Greg turns to the boys and says. ""Who can drive a sedan? I rigged it to make it look broken. With no time to wait he tosses the keys to Wily and writes down the address to the motel in Blue tower. He tells them once he finds Mark and the others, we'll all hide in the motel owner's cabin. ""They have an underground bunker in their cabin,"" says Greg jumping into the tow truck and revving the engine.

¬†""Why do they have a bunker in their cabin,"" asked Jimmy helping his father into the sedan as he and Wily buckle up.

¬†""They might be arms dealers and drug runners, their good people though, I swear,"" said Greg as he pulls the tow truck alongside the sedan. With that, both cars pull out of the parking lot and head in the same direction. Greg headed to the mayor's house to find Mark and Wily drove to Jimmy's house to find his mother, them to his place to get his mother and sister.

¬†Arriving just as his mother is taking out the trash. Jimmy jumps out of the car and runs to his mother pulling her by force into the car. ""You're hurting me stop‚Ä¶ What is it,"" said Jimmy's mother now looking down at her husband slumped over with a hole in his shoulder. He is passed out in the back seat. Before she can speak Wily pulls the car around and drives off down the road to his house. Hopefully to find his mother before the frogs do.

As he pulls up and opens the front door to his house, he sees his mother and goes upstairs to get his sister. Jimmy comes in to help to ask Wily's mother to help with his dad, as she walks to the car and sees Jimmy's father past out in his own blood, his wife holding him. Wily's mother Jane runs back in the house to call 911 as Wily runs past her with his sister bundled up in a blanket.

¬†Jane goes back outside and yells for everyone to get inside. ""Mom come out here now we have to go!!!"" screamed Wily at his mother who won't leave the house and is yelling for him to bring his sister back in the house. With everybody yelling, no one sees the shot that hits Jane in the chest as she falls Wily runs to grab her, but Jimmy pulls him into the car and drives off. With all the yelling and the shot people, all come out of their houses, seeing the bloody sedan and the two boys both covered in blood.

¬†Jimmy drives off headed for the highway as fast as possible. Looking back Wily sees an ambulance pull up and everyone points to the sedan.

¬†Arriving at the gates to harbor town Greg pulls up to the gate with his face hidden from the guards. He rings the bell to the gatehouse, coming out to inspect his truck the guard tells him to roll down the window.

Acting like he's drunk Greg rolls down his window and says. ""You‚Ä¶need to let me in, that dam mayor owes me some money! I brought him two of those guys on his hit list he only paid for one, tell him to get out here now!!!"" said Greg yelling to drive home his point.

¬†The guards tell him to pull up and wait for the mayor to call his phone in the guardhouse. The guard comes back out and tells Greg who he thinks is Kevin to get lost.

Leaning close so Greg can hear him, the guard finds a gun in his face. Stepping out of the car with the guard as a hostage, the two walk to the guardhouse.

¬†Greg handcuffs the Guard then knifes the man in the back of the head, taking his keys and entering the guardhouse. With the other guard distracted by the tv, Greg puts his gun to the back of his head and cuffs the guard to his desk.

¬†Ordering him to call the mayor again and tell him that drunk Kevin is still here and knifed someone at the gate. After a few minutes on the phone, the guard hangs up and tells Greg he's coming.

¬†""Good now keep your mouth shut and you might live to see tomorrow,"" said Greg, With the guards back to him Greg hit's him in the back of the head. Ducking down when the mayor's car pulls up. Greg turns off the light in the guardhouse. One of the mayor's men knocks on the glass.

¬†""Hey, open up your going to have to help us with the stiff."" says the bodyguard Banging on the glass and walking away. The man reports back to the mayor, it's Mr. Stark who then bangs on the glass. ""Open up or your fired get out here now!!!"" said mayor Stark.

¬†With less than a warm greeting, Greg opens the door, and the mayor finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. ""Hands up Mr. mayor, hi I'm Greg, you may have heard of me? now you have a friend of mine named Mark, let's go to your house shall we,"" he says.

¬†With no time to speak Greg cuffs the mayor using an extra set of cuffs, he finds in the guardhouse, then he walks up to the mayor's men. ""Turn around boys,"" said Greg. As the three men turn around, they see Greg holding a gun to the mayor's head. ""You three on the ground, hands up.

**Hyatt Place Page / Lake Powell**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-**\[+1\]**\-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - **\[Most Likely\]**

This place is close to all the popular tourist destinations. An excellent view of the sunrise from the room in the morning. One of the better hotels to stay if you plan a road trip in the western part of the US.

¬†

**Hyatt Place Moab**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-**\[+1\]**\-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - **\[Most Likely\]**

Just like HP Page, very close to the national parks. One of the better hotels in terms of condition in Moab, UT. Definitely add this one to the list as well if you are planning a road trip around the area.

¬†

**Grand Hyatt at SFO**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-**\[+3\]**\-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - **\[More Likely\]** \- \[Most Likely\]

One of the best airport hotels in the US. With it being only around 5 years since opening, the hotel‚Äôs in very good condition. AirTrain connections to the terminals and rental cars are very convenient. Also, you can camp out in the club lounge if you have an afternoon/evening flight after check out. Only caveat is the high cost of the room either cash or points.

¬†

**Hyatt House Vacaville**

Heard Andaz Napa was not worth it when I was planning a wine tasting trip in the region. So we stayed at this one instead (about 40 min extra drive). Since it is a new property, the condition is very nice. Nothing too special though. But at cat 2, I would not complain. Most likely to return here if I visit Napa again.¬†

¬†

**Hyatt Regency Baytown ‚Äì Houston**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-**\[+2\]**\-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

Had a stop-over in Houston while returning from Asia, and decided to spend a couple nights here while catching up with jetlag. A bit out of the way from the city, nice and quiet during the weekdays, a bit more active during the weekends it seemed. Newly opened, so the conditions were nice. Though I had the lake-view room, the lake seemed a bit polluted with murky water. Good breakfast with a big portion. I would stop here again if I were near Houston next time. 



**Hyatt Centric The Loop Chicago**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-**\[+2\]**\-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

One of the better cost-to-performance full service hotels in Chicago. The parking fee was a bit high, so we used parking app to park couple blocks down the street. The room was starting to show the age a little. Nonetheless with its great accessible location in the city and decent breakfast, I would probably visit here again when I am in Chicago.¬†

¬†

**Hyatt Vacation Club at Pi√±on Pointe**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-**\[+1\]**\-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

I had a satisfying stay here when I first went to Sedona almost ten years ago. When I returned this time, I felt it was aging a bit. But still a good option when in Sedona. No breakfast for Globalist as this is HVC. Still, there are a few good coffee shops in the walking distance near the hotel, so it wasn‚Äôt too much of a hassle.¬†



**Hyatt House Irvine/John Wayne Airport**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-**\[-1\]**\-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - **\[Not Likely\]** \- \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

The price and location wasn‚Äôt too bad, but the room that I got was very stinky. The whole room smelled like someone‚Äôs feet‚Ä¶ The breakfast was a typical HH quality. Maybe I would have rated this one higher, if not for being placed in that room that day.



**Hyatt Regency Jersey City on the Hudson**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-**\[-3\]**\-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

**\[Definitely Not\]** \- \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

The hotel is definitely aged, and the breakfast was meh. I would pick the Hyatt House next door to this one in a heartbeat. Probably would never return here.

¬†

¬†**Hyatt Place Riverside/Downtown**

\[-5\]-**\[-4\]**\-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

**\[Definitely Not\]** \- \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

The hotel was going through a renovation on the first floor, but I was never notified of this prior to the stay. I wanted to raise this issue after the stay on a survey email that I typically get after a stay, but never got the email. This was among the better places to stay in Riverside downtown, but that isn‚Äôt saying much about its quality. I would not return here and would rather drive a little next time.¬†

**Thompson Madrid**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-**\[+4\]**\-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - **\[Most Likely\]**

Excellent location, excellent facilities, and great breakfast. Very Thompson-like aesthetics with simple yet luxurious decor. Was upgraded to a suite after booking their standard room using points. I would definitely return here if I were to visit Madrid again.¬†

¬†

**Hyatt Regency Lisbon**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-**\[+3\]**\-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - **\[More Likely\]** \- \[Most Likely\]

Another great Hyatt property with great condition and excellent Globalist recognition. Was given an upgrade to a suite and invited to champaign-hour as a Globalist in the evening. The breakfast was a bit lacking compared to other European hotels though. A little bit out of the way from the popular tourist spots, but Uber is cheap in Portugal, so it was alright. If I were to visit Lisbon again, I would stay a few nights here and a few in the old town area.

¬†

\[Asia\]

**Andaz Pattaya Jomtien Beach**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-**\[+4\]**\-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - **\[Most Likely\]**

This was my favorite property that I had stayed in Asia in 2024. Very nice and new property with picturesque exterior decor. Breakfast spread was great with many tasty selections. And all of this at cat 4! I‚Äôd say one of the best places to redeem the free night award. A bit far from the city-center and the beach is a bit disappointing though. Nonetheless, most likely to return here again soon.



**Andaz Bali**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-**\[+4\]**\-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - **\[More Likely\]** \- \[Most Likely\]

Out of 4 hotels that I had stayed in Bali, this one was the best. Initially, I was placed in the garden suite through SUA, but was given the option to pay to upgrade to a swim-up suite for a nominal fee, which I took. The property felt nice and new, with a grass-top courtyard that felt warm and comfortable.The a-la-carte breakfast was excellent with many tasty choices, and the Korean BBQ night was very satisfying. TBH, I hadn‚Äôt really enjoyed Bali all that much, so not sure if I would return to the island, but if I do, I will probably revisit this property.



**Park Hyatt Seoul**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-**\[+4\]**\-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - **\[More Likely\]** \- \[Most Likely\]

Like most other luxury hotels in Korea, you never feel like they are above and beyond with their service; still a very decent Park Hyatt property. Not a big hotel in terms of number of rooms, but about half the time, I get upgraded to a suite. The deco isn‚Äôt over the top, but still maintains luxury. Too many sharp edges though, so you have to be careful not to bump into the furniture. The breakfast buffet is very strong, with a very good Korean menu. The location is also excellent, next to the Coex mall. Probably return here again when in Seoul.

¬†

**Grand Hyatt Incheon**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-**\[+3\]**\-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

A benchmark airport hotel. I have almost always gotten upgraded to a suite as a Globalist here. The evening hors d'oeuvres in the club is quite decent and usually lets me skip dinner. The breakfast buffet is excellent with good Asian selection. The Paradise Hotel next door is within the walking distance and offers good dining and shopping options as well. I usually stay here or at Courtyard Marriott Seoul Botanic Park when I need to stay near ICN.



**Hotel Toranomon Hills**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-**\[+4\]**\-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

Very nice location and room conditions. The breakfast quality was excellent but wished they had Japanese menu. Used SUA to get Tokyo Tower view corner suite with a fantastic evening view. The deco was Thompson-esque with sprinkles of Japanese aesthetics. The lounge with lite snacks and drinks was available; ice-cold ginger ale after returning from the heat outside always felt welcoming. Nonetheless, there are also other great Hyatt properties nearby, so I would not put this on over the others.



**Grand Hyatt Fukuoka**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-**\[+1\]**\-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - **\[Neutral\]** \- \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

The hotel felt early 2000ish, similar to the vibe at GH Bangkok, Hong Kong and Taipei. The room was aged a bit, and the sauna definitely was showing its age. Still, being in Japan, I felt the maintenance is being done on them. The food quality at the club lounge was excellent, especially during breakfast; mentaiko and sashimi over rice were really tasty. With the Canal City mall that is connected to this hotel, you feel like you are at a location past its prime time a couple of decades ago. If you are into that kind of aesthetics, maybe it's worth it for you. As for me, meh..¬†

¬†

**Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-**\[+2\]**\-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - **\[More Likely\]** \- \[Most Likely\]

I would say this is the Hyatt that I would pick as a Globalist in Hong Kong; GH across the harbor feels aged while location is a bit inconvenient for the Centric. The standard room feels a bit crammed, but if you get upgraded to a suite, it offers a much better experience with more space and features. The breakfast buffet has many options, but I saw only a few that looked attractive to me. One of the better places to use my cat 4 award.

¬†

**BEI Zhaolong Hotel**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-**\[+1\]**\-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - **\[More Likely\]** \- \[Most Likely\]

Last time I stayed at JW Marriott Beijing, it rained, and because of its caved-in location, I had a hell of a time getting a taxi/Didi. So this time, I tried this property since it was closer to a main road. At cat 1, this one is an excellent value. I was upgraded to a bigger room, and it was nice and clean. The breakfast was a bit lacking, but at 5,000 points per night in Beijing, this would be my pick next time I‚Äôm in Beijing.



**Park Hyatt Shenzhen**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-**\[+3\]**\-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

Compared to Andaz Shenzhen Bay, I prefer this one. A bit more classical luxury and quieter. The breakfast quality was about the same as the Andaz. After PHNY vs Andaz there and here in Shenzhen, I decided that I am more of a PH person than Andaz. Nonetheless, both for here and Andaz in Shenzhen, cat 5 is way over the top; I would not book these at cat 5. Next time I‚Äôm in Shenzhen, I plan to try cat 3 GH.



**UrCove Dongguan Fenggang**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-**\[0\]**\-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - \[Neutral\] - **\[Likely\]** \- \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

I had to stay a week in Shenzhen, and this place being at $50 per night, I had to try it out, both for my brand explorer and for qn. For the price, I have not much to complain about except for occasional smokers found in the lobby, or sometimes, even in the hallway. It is way out of the way, but if I am ever in Shenzhen again and need to mattress run, probably be back here for it.

¬†

**Hyatt Regency Koh Samui**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-\[+2\]-**\[+3\]**\-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - \[Less Likely\] - **\[Neutral\]** \- \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

One of my best friends had a wedding on this island, so I booked this room to save some cost. The suite I got through SUA was decent, with a nice and clean environment, as the property is still pretty new. The breakfast was decent, though the evening hors d'oeuvres menu was a bit limited. The whole property felt a bit small compared to other resorts on the island, or in SEA in general, so I‚Äôd probably choose another resort if I am ever back in Koh Samui.



**Andaz Shenzhen Bay**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-\[+1\]-**\[+2\]**\-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - **\[Less Likely\]** \- \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

This was the first 5-star hotel that I stayed in Shenzhen. I felt I saw all sorts of different Chinese people here - from young female influencers (or wannabes) dressed in flashy clothings taking pictures, and a mid-aged farmer couple blasting their smartphone at the highest volume while having breakfast, to a seemingly well-off young couple sipping their tea. Felt like it is where the new rich gather in Shenzhen. One of the most surprising things was that many of the hotel workers did not speak English, even at the reception. Location and facility-wise, it was pretty decent. Nonetheless, probably not return here, especially on points at cat 5.



**Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok**

\[-5\]-\[-4\]-\[-3\]-\[-2\]-\[-1\]-\[ 0 \]-**\[+1\]**\-\[+2\]-\[+3\]-\[+4\]-\[+5\]

\[Definitely Not\] - \[Not Likely\] - **\[Less Likely\]** \- \[Neutral\] - \[Likely\] - \[More Likely\] - \[Most Likely\]

I felt this GH is definitely aged, though it has been maintained alright. The vibe is similar to those of GH HK and Taipei. The breakfast was nice and decent, presented at the spacious lobby area. The location is in the middle of the city, which can help when walking around and taking the metro, but the traffic is really, I mean extremely, bad around here. I would not suggest here if you plan to take a taxi or rideshare.

When I first joined the World of Hyatt, the pictures of this place on the website were aspiring, so I made it my goal to visit here one day. Well, let me just say after one visit, I feel like I would never return here again. I can list so many things that I disliked about this one. First, I could definitely feel the age of the property. The tiles in and around the villa were chipped and cracked, and they were repaired haphazardly. The shower head was cracked, so the water was spraying everywhere, and it was rusting in green. The breakfast, though the menu was verbose with adjectives, was not very impressive. The only saving grace was the view of the cliffs, but there are decent properties around Uluwatu that I could go to for that view, especially with the recently remodeled LXR Umana Bali nearby. Overall, a huge disappointment. I would like to know why Hyatt gave this property the cat 8 designation; for me it was more of cat 5, or at best cat 6, property. Even then, I would not return here.",10,1736039678.0,hyatt,14,0.92,False

Life happened, I placed the cup somewhere and promptly forgot about it. Hours later I remembered the existence of said cup of coffee but had no idea where it ended up. That evening I discovered the location of said cup of black coffee by knocking it off a small shelf that is on the wall behind my bed, into the crack of death between my mattress and wall (no headboard) and all over every single pillow, sheet and blanket on my bed. I immediately stripped all the pillows off the bed wiped off what I could from the crack and wall, stepped on the pillows upside down on paper towels to soak it up and shoved a bunch of towels on the bed between the sheets and the mattress to soak that up. I found clean pillowcases but the pillows still have coffee stains on them and my big confession here is that I have yet to strip my bed of the sheets and wash them. I go to sleep every night on the coffee stains. There wasn't any cream or sugar so thankfully nothing rotten smelling, but I smell like stale coffee all the time now. and I can't bring myself to wash my damn sheets. why? Do I want to savor the smell of Christmas break? Do I fear the laundry room that bad? I am a 48-year-old woman and I can't bring myself to do this one task. I believe it's a mental block with just this particular task because I did remove the towels from in between the sheets because they're uncomfy to sleep on but I couldn't be bothered to continue removing all of the sheets and wash them.

1httroa,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1httroa/my_sister_is_financially_irresponsible_and_doesnt/,My sister is financially irresponsible and doesn't take advice ,"Background: I am a 21M and I lived at home with my mom, older sister \[28F\], & younger sister \[18F\] (latin background). My father used to be the breadwinner and brought in the income while my mom was a stay at home with me and my sisters. Due to some life circumstances he left the financial situation but not out of my life (not willingly but easiest way to say would be to say he moved out of the country) anymore. So that left my mom and my sisters & me to deal with the situation ourselves. That was around 5 years ago when that occured. Since then my mom ended working fulltime to be able to pay rent and support me and my siblings. We ended up moving to a new house some time later which we rented.

To help my mom I picked up a fulltime job at 18 and then I ended up joining the military about a year ago and since then I pay the utilities at home even being away from home. While my older sister is in charge of 1/2 rent and one utility and my mom for the other 1/2 of rent. My younger sister goes to school and works a part time but isn't responsible for any bills/financials.

The Issue: My older sister is quite irresponsible with her money. Whenever it comes time to pay rent she somehow almost always comes in short somehow for her half of rent, her shared bank account is frequently overdrawn, her vehicle registration is months past due.

The issue isn't necessarily that she is short from time to time I understand that life happens and thats why family is here to help eachother out. Its the fact that she almost always eats out at restaurants and never fails to buy coffee and other drinks while out. Almost every weekend she goes out to either bars, clubs, concerts/raves, or just some social gathering at somewhere where you need to pay. Clearly I can see that shes spending money but when she needs to pay her share theres none to be found or always doesn't have enough.

The issue enlarges in that whenever I try to sit down with her to create a budget with her, create some form of financial plan, or just try to give advice about credit to help her out she always gets bothered by it or at least gives off the impression of it. She raises her voice at me to say that im bothering her and she always has an excuse of why she cant do it with me at that moment ( stress, tired, or just random excuses.) and postpones it every time I bring it up.

My sisters say my mom is ""overbearing"" and ""too much"". I get it. I know my mom and she can be in her moods at times but its to the point where they say that to whenever my mom says basic things like to help clean the house or to even get them to clean their rooms. Their rooms are almost always a mess and not just disorganized stuff but sometimes piles of clothes or just random stuff that leads to roaches in the rooms.

My mom is always saying that she tries her best at home with maintaining the household (food, cleaning, etc) but that my sisters help very little if at all (my younger does a lot more than my older). 

What should I do? This has been ongoing for about 1-2 years. I really am at my wits end. 

Any advice to try to talk to my sister to help her get her stuff together?

Am I in the wrong for trying to help my older sis? Am I doing something wrong? I really just want my family to succeed and to not end up in the gutters.

Two years ago, I started experiencing diarrhea and excessive gas problems (this situation has been ongoing for two years, but a week ago, my doctor started antibiotic treatment suspecting SIBO, and now I no longer have diarrhea).

However, 19 months ago, despite having diarrhea, I began to feel like I couldn‚Äôt fully empty my bowels. I checked with my finger and noticed stool remaining in the rectum area. During this time, I had moved in with my boyfriend, and I couldn‚Äôt use the toilet when he was at home. Sometimes, I would hold my stool for days. I also struggled during sexual intercourse, feeling pain in my bowels (rectum area), and sex became unbearable for me.

Fifteen months ago, I moved into my own home, but the issue of incomplete evacuation didn‚Äôt improve; it even got worse. Additionally, a new problem started: stool would reach the rectum and stay there (not in the anus, but a part farther from the anus). To empty my bowels, I felt the need to drink coffee. In the last 15 months, I‚Äôve only fully evacuated 3-4 times.

For the past 4-5 months, I‚Äôve also been experiencing a loss of sensation in the rectum area. I only notice the presence of stool when I go to the toilet to urinate; otherwise, I don‚Äôt notice it throughout the day. I don‚Äôt feel the urge to defecate.

I‚Äôve gone to the doctor multiple times, but they send me away without examining anything, saying it might be psychological. Also, when I had diarrhea and went to the toilet, the evacuation would happen very quickly, even though stool remained inside.

For the past 8-9 days, I haven‚Äôt had diarrhea thanks to the medication, and even though the stool is soft, I feel the need to strain for it to come out.

Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm struggling with a breakup and could use some advice or perspective. Here‚Äôs a summary of what happened:
My (35) ex (she , 39) and I were together for over a year and a half. She was supportive, loving, and deeply cared for me, especially during a tough period in my life.
However, I made some mistakes in the relationship, including breaking her trust ( including infidelity) 
We been together in LDR for 18 months and before the breakup by a month she moved with her kids to live with me. 
After a lot of hurt and challenges, she broke up with me, saying she doesn‚Äôt see hope for us to get back together.
Despite the breakup, she‚Äôs still been responding to my messages, acknowledging my apologies, and even said she might meet for coffee in the future if I‚Äôm ever in her city.
We recently had a 30-minute conversation where she reiterated that she doesn‚Äôt see us getting back together, but it was a calm and respectful talk.
I sent her flowers and other small gestures for her birthday, which she appreciated but reminded me we‚Äôre done romantically.
I just told her I hope we can be friends in the future.
I still love her and miss her deeply, but I‚Äôm struggling to know what to do now. Should I hold onto hope or start moving on completely? Has anyone been in a similar situation where things worked out eventually?
I truly repent for my sins and begged her for another chance. 
Any advice on how to approach this or heal would mean a lot. Thanks for reading.

I Love her, but I truly Love her kids more than ever I think.

I voted for him in 2016, 2020, 2024, and I never thought he would stoop this low.

Along with being a republican, I was struggling with ADHD/anxiety/depression/PTSD, and I was working on sorting out these conditions with my doctors.  I never thought that politics could interfere with my access to healthcare.   I take Vyvanse 90mg PRN (brand name... need single payer insurance) and it has been nicely managing my symptoms for the last few years.  However, I was HORRIFIED to find out that under Trump, the DEA and DEI are going to slash the amount of ADHD treatment available to the American people.  The DEA will cut the manufacturing limit by 75% for ALL ADHD medications, and any coming from China will be totally barred by tariffs.  I had NO IDEA we would be looking at this kind of crackdown.  JD Vance even went on Fox to say that he doesn't believe stimulants are part of ADHD treatment.  Guess we'll have to go back to Strattera?? Wtf.

I am about to run out of my script for Vyvanse, and I am terrified that with Trump as president my local pharmacy will not have any of my MEDICATION that I NEED.

I will be writing to my state representatives, and I suggest that you all do as well.  We need the supreme court to protect access to critical medical care.  This situation is unprecedented... a 75% drop in access to care? What am I supposed to do? Many people like me are unable to function without their prescription and coffee.  We must pack in extra supreme court justices that are going to be willing to protect the medications that we need!

1httkka,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1httkka/incomplete_bowel_movements_and_rectal_area/,Incomplete bowel movements and rectal area numbness,"

Hi guys, English is not my native language, so there might be some mistakes in what I write. Two years ago, I started experiencing diarrhea and excessive gas problems (this situation has been ongoing for two years, but a week ago, my doctor started antibiotic treatment suspecting SIBO, and now I no longer have diarrhea). 

However, 19 months ago, despite having diarrhea, I began to feel like I couldn‚Äôt fully empty my bowels. I checked with my finger and noticed stool remaining in the rectum area. During this time, I had moved in with my boyfriend, and I couldn‚Äôt use the toilet when he was at home. Sometimes, I would hold my stool for days. I also struggled during sexual intercourse, feeling pain in my bowels (rectum area), and sex became unbearable for me. 

Fifteen months ago, I moved into my own home, but the issue of incomplete evacuation didn‚Äôt improve; it even got worse. Additionally, a new problem started: stool would reach the rectum and stay there (not in the anus, but a part farther from the anus). To empty my bowels, I felt the need to drink coffee. In the last 15 months, I‚Äôve only fully evacuated 3-4 times. 

For the past 4-5 months, I‚Äôve also been experiencing a loss of sensation in the rectum area. I only notice the presence of stool when I go to the toilet to urinate; otherwise, I don‚Äôt notice it throughout the day. I don‚Äôt feel the urge to defecate. 

I‚Äôve gone to the doctor multiple times, but they send me away without examining anything, saying it might be psychological. Also, when I had diarrhea and went to the toilet, the evacuation would happen very quickly, even though stool remained inside. 

For the past 8-9 days, I haven‚Äôt had diarrhea thanks to the medication, and even though the stool is soft, I feel the need to strain for it to come out. Has anyone experienced this situation, and does it get better? Please give me some advice; I‚Äôm starting to struggle a lot mentally.",1,1736038903.0,PelvicFloor,1,1.0,False

It is quite odd to think how it is that I found sanctuary. A group that treats me with utmost respect is a privilege I fear I mustn't in any circumstance deserve, yet such seems to remain firmly in my grasp. I feel comfort in this new state of mind, comparable to that of a fantasy world which thrives in discomfort. My wings have spread wide and beautiful, and a third eye has awakened within, which guides me to a happier future and the most wonderful people I have had the pleasure of talking with.

I found it about two months ago, when I decided to pick up a second job. The decision was painful. But I desperately needed the money. And so, I called the workplace of my old high school job: a retailer that sells food and houseware products. I wanted pay and familiarity, which was promised if I got the position, for the last thing I needed was added stress. It turns out that the store was under new ownership and much of the previous staff moved on from the place, including my old manager. I still went through with the decision, and secured an interview for the upcoming Saturday.

I cannot stress enough how badly I needed the job. I had made irresponsible decisions, and many payments were due within two weeks. With the job, the deadlines would barely be made in time.

Feelings of anxiety piled before the interview. I felt restless, and I sensed an arduous, stressful feeling in the air. On Friday, I calmed my mind with online media; red light beamed through my eyes. The imagery was fascinating, and served as a good distraction from the stresses of the real world. I recall falling asleep that day to the sound of rain.

The interview was scheduled for nine in the morning. When I arrived, not a single vehicle sat parked on the lot. The building appeared bigger than I remembered and its front was dark with shadow. An eeriness emanated from the door, and when I stepped through, all was silent. But to my relief, an associate greeted me with a large smile. He wore a red vest, jeans, and average, typical sneakers. He seemed genuinely happy to be there.

‚ÄúHey, are you here for the interview?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. Doug is waiting for you in the office. Just go through the silver doors in the back.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks. I actually used to work here before the ownership change.‚Äù

His smile grew larger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll hire you in a heartbeat then. Good luck!‚Äù¬†

The layout of the place remained the same, which could not be said about the displays and colors. The store‚Äôs new look was uncanny, at least for me, of whom expected little change in the interior‚Äôs appearance. Each isle was vacant. And the silver doors remained in the same spot and same rusted, dented state since I had left the job prior.

Beyond the silver doors lay a vast maze of boxes stacked horribly high. And to get to the office, one has to cross through such a maze. Its layout changed since I‚Äôd last seen it. Luckily, a yellow streak of paint was splattered upon the floor, and curved through the boxes, and eventually led to the office door.

An indescribable ambience haunted that back room, to which I felt the very second I stepped within. It was a new feeling to which I‚Äôd never experienced beforehand, and I could feel it in my stomach, a wriggling horror which heightened the deeper I stepped through that maze, meticulously following the yellow line, and peaked upon reaching the office door. Somehow I built up the courage to knock. Without hesitation the door swung open, and Doug shot a glare straight through me. He stood tall, almost as high as the doorway. His shadow stretched far against the boxes stacked behind me.¬†

‚ÄúHey there Rick,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúHere, step right in. I‚Äôve got a chair set, all nice for you.‚Äù

There was something about Doug that was off. He was too nice. And he was too prepared. The office was warm, but admittedly comfortable. He decorated the place as if it was a log cabin in the midst of the tallest mountain-peaks. A buck‚Äôs head sat above the desk, and candles were lit upon the shelves. The floor, which was once concrete, was now replaced with dark oak hardwoods. A light dangled overhead. Doug urged me to sit down and make myself comfortable, whilst he adjusted the collar of his flannel shirt. A steaming mug of coffee sat near his keyboard. He prepared some for me as well.

We went through the general motions of an interview. He asked the usual questions, wishing to hear why I wanted to work at the store, and my overall experience with retail. Twiddling his thumbs, he stared at his computer screen, and licked his cracked lips. I assume he was reading my resume.

‚ÄúAlight Rick, I‚Äôm going to be honest,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou were going to get hired anyway. Previously working in this building basically secured that. It‚Äôs only company policy that I ask you all these cheesy questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, Doug, I really appreciate it. I needed this,‚Äù I said, shifting in my chair. ‚ÄúWell, I like what they‚Äôve done with the place.‚Äù That was a lie.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing a good job, aren‚Äôt they? I mean, look at this office! Just wish they‚Äôd install the new sound system already.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit freaky out there with no music.‚Äù

Doug stood up and paced around the desk, placing his hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs why I fear we haven‚Äôt been getting a consistent stream of customers. Sales have been down in the mornings. Lack of music probably scares em‚Äô away!‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúEverything eventually picks up, though.‚Äù He continued to pace around the room. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre probably gonna keep you in the aisles, stocking shelves and whatnot, pushing freight. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do just fine.

‚ÄúThere is one catch, however. And Rick, I urge you to listen to what I say: you must never step through that door.‚Äù He pointed to the back corner of the office. ‚ÄúNever open that door. Ever. I think I can trust you enough to listen. The previous owners urged us to keep it shut. Not that you‚Äôd be able to open it anyway; it‚Äôs locked from the inside. But don‚Äôt ever try to get in there, *ever*.‚Äù

As I peered into that dark corner of the room, evil seeped into my heart. And all went muffled, and I could hear nothing but the faintest noises throughout the store‚Äôs entirety. That door consumed me. It whispered to me. I thought of all the pretty imagery I saw the night before: the reds, the blacks, the yellows, the swirling patterns. It all came before me at once, and I snapped back into reality. Doug was shaking my hand. He was sweating.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to start tomorrow. You‚Äôll get paid more because it‚Äôll be Sunday. Be here around ten. I‚Äôll have paperwork for you to sign.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said with a stutter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here. Right at ten-o-clock.‚Äù

The next morning was gray and dreadful. The sun hardly shone through the flat blanket of clouds above. I felt a bit sick whilst driving to the store. The night had been restless, yet calm. Puddles, like shattered glass, reflected the sky above. Traffic kept steady, and before I realized, I missed the turn into the store‚Äôs parking lot.

I parked the car just five minutes before ten. It wasn‚Äôt dead this time. It was quite busy, actually, as expected of a Sunday morning. Yet silence still bellowed through the customer‚Äôs footsteps. And once I talked with Doug again, he led me back into the office and plopped an unfathomably large stack of papers in front of me. It took roughly an hour to cycle through them all, harshly signing my name until my hand grew numb. By the end, the warm light which dangled above began to flicker. After that, we chatted a bit, and he took me for a tour around the place. Most of it I already knew about, which was a fact Doug loved to reinforce intensely, followed by the phrase: ‚Äúit‚Äôs company policy I tell you this stuff, even if you‚Äôve done the job before.‚Äù

At around one-o-clock, the store was empty. An ambient hum was ringing in my brain, and I phased out entirely what Doug was telling me. I thought about the door. Why did I feel that way about the door? What rests beyond the door?

Doug led me to the front of the store, and introduced me to everyone who worked there. Kindness and comfort clearly filled all of their souls. A part of me was jealous; I was fond of their smiles which I could never seem to muster in the real world. Such disgusts me. Humans are a plague that infests society with pointless problems and hatred. It seems, as a society, we will never learn to love and respect each other, and agree to disagree. That thought ruins me every day. But I‚Äôll save those ramblings for another time.

Marie was the associate assigned to train me. She was an older woman who started working there once the new management took ownership. She absolutely loves the job, and kept telling me so over and over. I felt irritated by her, at least to start. And furthermore, she seemed to like me as well. We started in the household chemical area of the store, which Marie kept in pristine condition. For her looks, she seemed scarily efficient.¬†

After maintaining the chemical aisles, Marie urged we must clean up the food department. I cannot say she was wrong; it took over an hour to fix the shelves to standard. And once the aisles were recovered, we began to stock the products.

‚ÄúThis is my ritual every Sunday,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúSay, how was this store before the new management took over? I started here after the fact.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honestly the same as it was a while back,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe looks have changed for sure, but the departments and store layout remain the same. Although it is quite odd not to have music playing through the speakers. And I do get weirded out a bit by the changes to the displays.‚Äù¬†

Marie stacked cans of soup upon the shelf and spoke: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll surely get used to it. And the music should be fixed pretty soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs what Doug said.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoug‚Äôs a nice guy. He hasn‚Äôt let me down yet. Say, you know the deer head in the office? My husband sold it to em‚Äô a bit ago. It really brings that room together.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes your husband go hunting often?‚Äù

Marie turned towards me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what pays the bills. As long as I get to stay here at the store, I‚Äôm fine with whatever he does. Hunting benefits me, too. He supplies‚Äì ouch.‚Äù Marie nicked her finger whilst cutting a box, and blood seeped down her hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very warm. Let me run to the back real quick, I won‚Äôt be long.‚Äù

Marie sometimes exhibited very strange behavior, and as time went on, I noticed how similar the employees were. Their faces were cold without expression, yet they exuded incredible amounts of kindness. Just the place! Yes, I had finally found my people. And about two weeks later, a beautiful event solidified my feelings. Such is so great, I wish to share it here on this website to the whole wide world. Oh, how so clandestine, how such a glorious decadence, could be hidden in a retail store!

I was assigned a closing shift, and as soon as I turned the key and locked the front door, whispers spoke through the walls. They told me I must dart to receiving, and past the office door. The speakers, which were now fixed, blasted a wonderful piano ballad, which seemed to grow louder as I passed the rusted silver doors. The yellow streak upon the ground accelerated forward, and now at this moment it all made sense; the answer was in the splattered, yellow paint all along. It is the very thing which guided me to salvation! I bashed through the office door, and beheld the sight of the forbidden door, just hardly cracked open. I stepped through, despite Doug‚Äôs words, and my intuition rewarded my daringness! Red was splattered everywhere, I tell you, and amorphous piles of flesh piled around my coworkers.¬†

I joined them, and we all sat within the circle, chanting to the piano tune, smearing the warmth of blood across each other‚Äôs bodies. And Doug and Marie welcomed me with open arms, and they explained how all the animal parts are acquired from many people, one of them being the husband of Marie. No wonder they refused me access to the room right away! But now, after realizing the kind of being I was, they welcomed me to the prayer circle, surrounded by the aroma of rotting matter and candles, scarfing down the remains of past life! The holy grail dangled from the ceiling, and with a rope tied to her neck, we peered up to the horribly high ceiling, and felt her warmth drip to us below! It was just like the footage I‚Äôd seen online. Arousal boiled in my blood.

I know I‚Äôve explained this all inordinately quick, but you see, when speaking about this matter, I get far too excited, and so I just skipped right to the good stuff.¬† I believe it is our job to control life in this world, for it is the plague of Earth. We have ruined this lovely environment. And solving such issues is exactly what Doug, and everyone else, wishes to come out of the movement. The human race, and all Animalia must be vanquished. I still refuse to fathom that there‚Äôs people out there like me. Me! Of all people, me! Who shares my motives! So join us, sisters, brothers! Help the cause!",3,1736038861.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone just jotting down my experience so far with hers! I would say I'm pretty positive and would rate my experience a 7/10. I've had minimal side effects from the meds and maybe a few positive ones!

 Just some background I spent most of my twenties around 143-148. I could lose weight if I packed a few lbs on. I was diagnosed with pmdd and was on Depo provera because honestly getting rid of my period ended up working best for me. In doing that I've slowly crept up into the high 150s and low 160s. Previously done diligent CICO and consistent exercising and the scale literally wouldn't budge. This fall I saw a lot of my colleagues dropping weight like crazy on semiglutides and I was over being mean to my self and was ready to go chemical. 

I decided after college I actually don't like a normal life so I'm a professional horse trainer. I ride 8-10 horses a day. It is pretty physical, although I do have help saddling and grooming. I also spent 3-5 days in the gym mostly to support my mobility for my job. Doing this I just have learned to eat intuitively over the last 5 years. A lot of stuff makes me bloated or shitty when I eat it now that I'm past 30 and a lot of my job relies on me feeling okay. 

Because of my lifestyle, once I started the medication I haven't done any sort of food restriction ie calorie counting outside of what the meds make me feel. But I have the structure in my life already to hit my macros. 

I also take a lot of supplements for inflammation already and I wonder if some of them have helped may have helped with some. My current stack is:

Migrelief-a high quality migraine supplement that I think helps with constipation and sleeping. I take one caplet which is 200mg Riboflavin 180mg magnesium citrate and oxide and 50mg of puracol feverfew 

Doctors Best Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM +Hyaluronic acid  This one is a bit longer to write out but I think the collegen isn't hurting my hair. I've noticed no change in my normal shedding

You Theory Tumeric- I take it for general aches and pains 

Nature's made Potassium Gluconate- I sweat a lot haha I got a horrible norovirus this summer and after that I got really bad leg spasms. This helped a ton. I also notice I drink way more water with it. I think it could help with some of the tingling side effects people are getting.

I think the only side effect I have to complain about is the general bloating and stomach pressure. I couldn't even run a mile without getting a horrible side stich. That's from the Metformin I believe. The bupropion makes me super alert so I had to give up on my beloved coffee. I was constipated but just upped the magnesium to twice a day and that got everything moving again. 

I do think the topiramate and LDN has had some positive effects for me. I've heard LDN being used for Long hauler COVID and fibromyalgia. We had a flu sweep through work and I felt sleepy on Tuesday for the first time since being on bupropion. Then I spent one night with chills and a fever and the next day it was gone, burned right out. Everyone else this flu kept in bed for two full days. 

Also on a positive note no migraines but I don't think I can credit the topiramate yet as I don't think I've tiered up to the normal migraine prevention dose I was in high school quite yet. 

If you made it this far thanks! All in all I'm happy I've lost weight I literally have not been able to move since being on and off of depo provera. I wish I had no side effects but I am okay with the ones I have and will be staying the course.",2,1736038349.0,HersWeightloss,1,1.0,False
1httd03,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1httd03,90s home Reno advice,"Hey everyone, need some help with design ideas.

I just bought a 90s home that was renovated in 2000s grey - grey floors, agreeable grey paint, etc. these are the stock photos from the listing. I wanted to see what everyone thought I should do with the space.

For the living room I was thinking sofa, 2 chairs and coffee table, potentially a floor mirror and tall plant and blanket basket on the stair wall and a hutch or console on the back wall, but what type? My style I‚Äôm hoping to go with is Chris Loves Julia style. 

Would you put curtains over these living room windows? Or sconces between the windows? I want to use secondary light options so any advice on where to add those would be lovely (husband is an electrician). Anything else I should do with that big back wall? Moulding perhaps, just seems like a hard room to do moulding. 

Also, what would you put next to the fireplace? Bookcases, a reading nook to the right? Help a girl out!

For the breakfast area I was thinking up to ceiling wrap around curtains, then two plant stands in the corners with overflowing ivy like plants‚Ä¶..

What would you do? 


(And yes, I‚Äôll change out the lighting) ",1,1736038293.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1httc89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stockton/comments/1httc89/please_criticize_social_event_calendar/,Please Criticize Social Event Calendar!!,"CRITISISM NEEDED. I didn't get to post my event calendar for January yet, but I figued I asked the community before it goes live.

The Saturday events that are in blue are community walks. They are 2 mile walks, takes about 1 hour and they start at 10am. No RSVP required and new members welcomed.

The Sunday events, in yellow, are coffee meet ups. They are about socializing mainly. Meet and greet style. I'm planning to bring card games like UNO if only a few people show up. I have it scheduled for 8am. I'm thinking this should be an RSVP event for current members.

  
My concerns are the days/times. Is 8am for Sunday coffee too early? Also, thoughts on the RSVP for the coffee meet ups. This will be my first time hosting an event like this so I am thinking about the logistics.

Please help, I'd like to go live with the calendar by Sunday night at the latest :\]
