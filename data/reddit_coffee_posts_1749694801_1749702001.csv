My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.  
  
That much, I've always known.  
  
His father avoids all family matters like the plague.  
  
His mother looks down on my middle-class background.  
  
And Carter?  
  
His heart was never mine to begin with.  
  
But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.  
  
Bright. Charming.  
  
And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.  
  
He even started learning French—and picked it up fast.  
  
Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.  
  
At first, I was proud.  
  
A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.  
  
It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.  
  
Until I started secretly studying French myself.  
  
And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.  
  
And little by little, my heart froze over.  
  
Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,  
  
But to please Vivienne—the woman Carter's always loved.  
  
Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.  
  
They were inseparable once,  
  
But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her—  
  
Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.  
  
Meanwhile, I—a girl from an average Ohio family—was married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""  
  
So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy—and completely devoid of love.  
  
I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.  
  
He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.  
  
""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""  
  
""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""  
  
His eyes locked on me, full of warning.  
  
""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""  
  
Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.  
  
Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.  
  
Back then, only the baby mattered—never me.  
  
Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,  
  
As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,  
  
Carter never even came to check if I survived.  
  
I nodded.  
  
I didn't ask who the baby's father was.  
  
Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,  
  
I would've lost my mind.  
  
I fought. Screamed.  
  
And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.  
  
But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.  
  
""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.  
  
""Give her space to rest.""  
  
Carter paused.  
  
Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.  
  
""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""  
  
Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.  
  
Carter stared into my eyes.  
  
Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?  
  
Or if I even had the strength left to care?  
  
For a second, maybe I imagined it—but I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.  
  
Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.  
  
Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.  
  
But we have a place out in Westchester.  
  
I'll have it signed over to you.  
  
You can go there whenever you want… clear your head.""  
  
I understood.  
  
This was my reward for ""being mature.""  
  
He hated that I might have tainted the family line.  
  
So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.  
  
No matter the cost.  
  
And he was willing to be generous about it.  
  
Which made me wonder—  
  
When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?  
  
After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Vivienne moved in early that morning.  
  
I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.  
  
They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.  
  
Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.  
  
""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.  
  
""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""  
  
I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.  
  
Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.  
  
""Oh—sorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""  
  
'I thought you were the gardener.""  
  
She offered a tight smile.  
  
""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""  
  
""I'll just deal with it.""  
  
Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.  
  
""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‘deal with' anything.""  
  
""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""  
  
I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.  
  
Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.  
  
But instead, I nodded.  
  
""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""  
  
""Just have the gardener take care of it.""  
  
Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.  
  
For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.  
  
""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.  
  
""I know you put a lot into them.""  
  
I did love those flowers.  
  
They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.  
  
But now, it didn't matter anymore.  
  
""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.  
  
I checked my phone—my meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.  
  
I gave them both a polite nod.  
  
""Excuse me.""  
  
As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.  
  
Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.  
  
He let go immediately.  
  
""Come back early,"" he said.  
  
""There's something I need to talk to you about.""  
  
I nodded.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.  
  
Even if it was just for a little while.  
  
I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown—the same one I used to frequent back in college.  
  
The owner did a double take when she saw me.  
  
I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.  
  
Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.  
  
The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.  
  
The investigator handed me a file.  
  
""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""  
  
""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""  
  
So Carter's miracle child—wasn't even his.  
  
If he found out, would he be disgusted?  
  
Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?  
  
I looked up at the investigator.  
  
""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""  
  
""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.  
  
I pressed a hand to my belly.  
  
""And what if the baby's not his?""  
  
He blinked, visibly thrown.  
  
""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But—""  
  
I cut him off with a shake of my head.  
  
That was all I needed to hear.  
  
If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...  
  
Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.  
  
They both looked up the moment I walked in.  
  
Their smiles dropped.  
  
Carter frowned.  
  
""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""  
  
I chuckled.  
  
""You told me to come back early.""  
  
""Said you had something to talk about.""  
  
Carter hesitated.  
  
He clearly forgot.  
  
He cleared his throat.  
  
""Doesn't matter now.""  
  
""The annual family dinner—Vivienne's handling it this year.""  
  
Every year, I handled that dinner.  
  
Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.  
  
It was my duty.  
  
Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.  
  
The menu, the flowers, the lighting—nothing was ever good enough.  
  
But at least it came with the title.  
  
Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.  
  
I gave a tight-lipped smile.  
  
""Sure. It's your house, your call.""  
  
Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.  
  
Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""  
  
She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.  
  
""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""  
  
Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.  
  
They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.  
  
Laughing together.  
  
Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.  
  
""This dinner's for my baby brother!""  
  
They looked like the perfect little family.  
  
And I—  
  
I was just background noise.  
  
I walked upstairs without another word.  
  
For days, I stayed out of sight.  
  
They loved it.  
  
Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.  
  
But this wasn't her world.  
  
She got overwhelmed quickly.  
  
I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.  
  
""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""  
  
Carter held her tighter.  
  
""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""  
  
The next night, Carter knocked on my door.  
  
That alone was unusual.  
  
When I opened it, he didn't waste time.  
  
""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""  
  
""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""  
  
I smiled.  
  
""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""  
  
He looked surprised.  
  
Like he'd only just remembered that.  
  
Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.  
  
No one offered to help.  
  
No one cared.  
  
And now?  
  
A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.  
  
I cut him off before he could apologize.  
  
""I'll help with the background stuff.""  
  
'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""  
  
Carter blinked, clearly thrown.  
  
""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""  
  
After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.  
  
And I was giving it up.  
  
""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.  
  
Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.  
  
But I'd already closed the door.  
  
He stood there for a while.  
  
Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.  
  
Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.

I was in college at the time living in a heavy tourism town. My home town is a 4hr drive from my university. This part is relevant to the story.
I had met my best at the time, I'll call her Taylor, freshman year of college because we randomly were assigned to be roommates and instantly hit it off. We grew up in the same region so we bonded on how similar our families were. We had gone through many big events in both each other's lives and had always supported each other in our endeavors. We had previously lived together with two other friends before I moved out. I got engaged after we no longer lived together. 

I know my husband and I got engaged very young, but we had an instant connection. I knew 6 months in that this was the man for me. Even better, he and Taylor had a strong friendship themselves. She even helped him pick out my engagement ring.

When it came time for me to begin planning my wedding and choosing who I'd have in my bridal party, it was a no brainer. I asked Taylor if she would be my maid of honor and she excitedly said yes. I asked her two years before the wedding happened if she would be my maid of honor. 

Now for a little information about Taylor. She's insanely creative and always has been. Shes always dreamed of starting a band and a year after my engagement, it finally happened. She has been writing songs for months prior and was living on a high. Being that we were best friends, of course I always supported her. I read her lyrics whenever she wanted to show them to me, always encouraged her even when she doubted herself, as any friend would do. 

In our college town, there were a few bands that would perform at a local coffee shop on thurs-sun nights. I had gone to several shows in support and it was always a blast. 

When I asked her to come look at bridesmaids dresses with me, she was more than willing. She tried on dress after dress giving me her unfiltered opinion as she always did and with her help I decided on a few designs I liked and she even picked which dress she was going to wear. We didn't buy anything as the date hadn't been set yet. The only thing that was set was that it would be a year from then. 

Because the wedding was happening in my home town, 4hrs away, I would often take day trips to look at venues, meet with florists, caterers, everything to plan the wedding. Everytime I went I asked Taylor to come with me. She would always say she had band practice and couldn't miss it and I said okay. I knew it was extremely important to her. I was truly alright with it as long as she was going to be there for my big day. My husband and I decided on the date a few weeks after dress shopping

Fast forward 8 months later, Taylor and her band were still trying to find their sound and test out some of their songs before a performance. Their band had just started getting traction and were performing regularly almost every other weekend at the local coffee shop. It was an event for those who were into the genre of music so there was always a decent 50-75ish people who would go to these shows. Now they werent big anywhere except our college town. Taylor's confidence in her music career progressed so much she decided to make stickers, tshirts, and other merch to sell at their shows. They weren't the only band to do this and there were always three bands who played every night.

One night, I get a call late at night from Taylor. I assumed she just wanted a late-night adventure buddy and was calling to see if I was up for it. Wrong. She started off apologizing and I was confused as to what she was referring to. She was calling to say that she had agreed to do a show the night of my wedding. Mind you, she knew about the date before her band had their first rehearsal. She told me she had forgotten the date and had given the ""okay"" to play at a different venue the same day as my wedding. It wasn't another coffee shop, it was a lot bigger area, but not a traditional concert stage you'd see at a music festival. 

She started rambling saying, ""how much of the wedding do you actually need me for? What if I just came for the ceremony and left right after? What time is your wedding again? Could you possibly move it earlier in the day?"" She continued asking many questions of this nature. I was under the impression that she wanted to come to the wedding and was honestly trying to figure out how to do that. I was sadly wrong. When she asked me ""what should I do,"" I knew that she had already made up her mind. She was going to skip my wedding entirely. ""You've already decided, haven't you."" She just apologized and said she couldn't disappoint her fans.
I asked her if she consulted anyone else before coming to me and she said ""yes, they all agreed I should miss your wedding."" Granted, all the people she asked were those in her band, in other bands, and those who attended these shows regularly.  

I realized there was nothing I could say or do to convince her to come. I was extremely hurt and a little insulted. ""How much of the wedding do I actually need to be present for?"" That was a real slap in the face. It also frustrated me that she called me acting like she was trying to find a compromise when it was obvious she had already made her decision and was just working up the courage to tell me. I cried for hours that night. I called one of my other super close friends sobbing. I don't think I was mad yet. I was just crying and was trying to understand how someone I presumed to be my best friend would do this. 

Up until my wedding day, which was a few months from then, I hadn't heard from her. Not a text. Not a call. Nothing. On the day of my wedding, she texted me asking something along the lines of if I had cold feet and was anxious. That was it. Nothing else. 

For anyone wondering, the seluvcess of her local town band was slowly fading. Two positions in the band kept being replaced until everyone besides Taylor was done with the band dream and continued on with life. They disbanded the summer after the wedding and had all moved away since college was over and it was time to move on. Everyone of the music crowd had graduated or moved away resulting in the punk scene to cycle through to the next batch of people who hadn't heard of her band before. 

Not sure how to end this point. Feel free to ask any questions you may have and I'll try to answer when I can. Thank you reddit for allowing me to let out my frustrations that have been sitting with me for months. ",1,1749701273.0,u_throwaway8282748,0,1.0,False

They keep asking me why it’s doing that, and I have no idea what to tell them. Any insights? They don’t use the driver assist features, while I rely fairly heavily on adaptive cruise control, so maybe that’s what causes it? That’s the only thing I can think of. I’m a better driver than my Mom, but my Dad is a much better driver than me and he still got told to take a break after ~ an hour of driving, so I don’t think it’s about drifting or unsafe driving.

No art school, no formal training, just me, a whole lot of trial and error, and maybe too much coffee.

Just a bit of courage, a bunch of curiosity, and the willingness to keep showing up.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Greetings Sobernauts!

I apologize for not being active in the comments yesterday, it got quite busy. My partner and I went into the city to see one of my long term favorite bands, Sleigh Bells. I love that in an environment filled with alcohol, I am able to focus on the music and the people I showed up with. Nothing else exists.

Today I’m centering myself in gratitude. Sobriety isn’t always easy, but reflecting on what I’m thankful for helps me stay grounded and present. In the chaos of early recovery or the routine of long-term sobriety, it’s easy to forget just how much we’ve gained by choosing to live differently.

I am grateful for my supportive partner, the friends I’ve made in AA, the friends who stuck by me despite the flaws and pain that led me to quit drinking, my cat Schmoops who always knows when to curl up on my lap, and the ability to wake up with clarity and peace. I’m grateful for quiet mornings and coffee, honest conversations, live music, and a body and mind that feels stronger every day. I’m grateful that even on hard days, I have tools to cope that don’t involve escape. I am grateful to be an entirely different person than the one I was when I was drinking.

What are you grateful for today? Whether it’s big or small, take a few moments to write a short gratitude list. Your words might help someone else shift their perspective, especially if they’re struggling.

If you have 30 days or more and would like to host the daily check in for a week, reach out to u/SaintHomer. It may seem like work, but service keeps us sober, and it’s a lot more gratifying than it is effort. I love seeing the same thoughtful regulars in my inbox inspiring me every day.

\*\*\*

“Mommy … go.” I push the cart around the store as I watch my beautiful two-year-old daughter Rebel clap her hands as I go faster, and she squeals in delight.

She is so much like him. He who shall not be named kind of scenario. She doesn’t take after me much apart from the honey eyes. Her dark blonde hair and nose are like his and boy, does she have his temper.

“Ok Rebel, we need to finish this. Then we will go to the park. How does that sound?” she kicks her legs and claps again. I chuckle at her behaviour, leaning down to kiss her head. I finish off shopping and head out to the car.

I left home over three years ago. Three years I ran. The same man that is Rebel’s father hurt and humiliated me. I never got to tell him he was about to become a father. The woman he claimed had already done that. I couldn’t risk my parents finding out, either. It would have caused a war between my family and his MC.

My dad is the Don of the Moretti empire and my momma, well, she is the head of the cartel and the DeNucci family. I am their only daughter. The princess of the combined empire. My twin brother Nathaniel is next in-line to take the position of Don after dad retires and me well, I was supposed to take over the DeNucci family and my younger brother Nico would take over the cartel.

That all went to mess when I ran. It was difficult at first going to a new place. Living not just for myself but for the life I was carrying inside of me. The savings I had I used to find a place to live, get everything we needed and what was left, I invested it in a rundown bar.

I changed my name and never looked back. My bar is doing so well and it is nice to know that I have made it what it is today. The bar is called the Eclipse. The town we live in is a tourist town. So we get different people coming and going.

Most people come here to the lake in the summer and the skiing in the winter. It’s a friendly and safe place to live and I am happy here. When I first arrived here, I was lost, but I was welcomed and I wouldn’t leave even if you paid me too.

Once we have arrived at the house. It’s nothing like the Moretti mansion, but it’s home. With its white picket fence. White walls and blue door. It doesn’t look like much from the outside, but it’s open plan on the inside and modern. Upstairs there are three bedrooms, all with an en-suite and a family bathroom. Rebel has her own room next to mine and life is good.

She doesn’t want for anything; I carry the shopping inside and then carry Rebel in. Shutting the door, I place her in the living room with some of her toys as I put the shopping away. Just then, Boomer bounds inside. Rebel loves him as much as he loves her. I got Boomer when I was preqnant and both he and Rebel grew together.

He is a beautiful big softy. He is a Cane Corso. He is as black as night with a tiny patch of white on his tʃest. He is our protector, even if he does drool everywhere and talks back when you tell him no.

My phone rings and I take it out of my back pocket and see that it is Coral who is supposed to work the bar tonight. I gr0an, knowing she is about to ask me to cover her shift, no doubt because her douchebag ex won’t have their child tonight.

“Hey Coral, what’s up?”

“Hey Angie, look, I’m really sorry to do this, but Steve ditched me and I can’t find a sitter.” I roll my eyes. If I had a dollar for every time he has let her down over the last year, I would be a wealthy woman.

“Ok. Coral, no worries, but you and I need to have a chat about this. I will cover tonight, but you need to sort this out.” I hate being the bad guy, but she knows I have a toddler, too. I don’t have the support she does, even if it is my own doing.

“I will get it sorted. I’m so sorry Angie. I promise I will make it up to you.” We say goodbye and end the call. I look at Rebel and sigh. Still time to take the little miss to the park, and then I will have to call Mrs Lawson and see if she is available. I know she will be she loves Rebel.

“Boomer, leash.” I say and he is off to get what I’ve asked as I scoop up my now rowdy toddler and get her ready for the park.

“Go now?” I smile at her.

“Yes, sweetheart, we can go now.” I say, kissing her on her cheek. Grab the stroller and strap her in. Getting her in is always a workout. The child goes as stiff as a board and she finds it hilarious.

I make the call to Mrs Lawson as I put the leash on Boomer and pray she can help.

“Hello, Angie, how are my two favourite girls today?” I grab my keys and some snacks and drinks, placing them in the changing bag and attach it to the stroller.

“We are doing just fine. I hate to do this last minute, but Coral called and …”

“Say no more. I will be at your house at seven, then you can head out.” God love this woman. She is my lifeline.

“Thank you so much, I hate to spring it last minute.”

“Nonsense, sweetheart. You know I love to help out.”

“Thank you again, Mrs Lawson. I will see you soon.”

“How many times, call me Scar. You are family. No need to thank me. I will see you both soon. Bye Angie.” I hang up and head out.

After a couple of hours at the park and one tuckered out Rebel, she is fed and bathed and ready for bed. Mrs Lawson arrives and I head to work.

Pulling up at the bar, I notice we are packed out tonight. Well, at least the shift will go quickly.

Leaving the car, I head inside. I smile at some of the locals and make my way behind the bar. The night goes smoothly and begins to quiet down. I look at Max and tell him I’m going to office and if he needs me to come get me.

I head to the office to get some 0rders done and check the accounts and I lose track of time.

“Erm, Ang. I need you back at the bar.” I look up and smile as I stand and leave the office, shutting and locking the door behind me.

The music gets louder the closer I get to the bar. The sound of raucous laughter fills the air and something feels off. My gut twists and flutters the closer I get.

Stepping out behind the bar, I freeze. No, it can’t be. I notice the cuts.

The Princes of Darkness MC with white stitching against the black leather. An embroidered patch of a red devil with wings riding a Harley. The same MC that he runs, the very same MC that is in allegiance with my family. What are they doing this far out?

“Angel.” My eyes widen and my heart jumps into my throat as I look into the icy blue eyes of the man who broke my heart, the man who forked his wh0re in front of me, the man I ran from, the father of my daughter.

Ryder ‘Savage’ Jackson.

Chapter 2

Savage POV.

I look at the profile picture on my messaging app. It hasn’t changed in three years. I sigh as I open her contact and see all the messages I have sent her over the last three years, and each has gone unread. I’m so fricking dumb.

FLASHBACK!

It’s been four weeks since I ended my relationship with Angel and claimed Foxy as my woman. Everything has been great. Angel has not contacted me, but I do find myself looking at her profile picture.

“What’s wrong baby?” a hand rubs my bare arm as I close the app and look at the woman beside me. Foxy with her red hair and brown eyes. She is beautiful. She is the mother of our unborn child.

“Nothing babe, go back to sleep.” I kiss her head and she snuggles back down, but I can’t sleep. Something isn’t right. My gut is telling me I should check up on Angel. I shake that thought away.

Why should I? The s1vt was cheating on me. She doesn’t deserve my concern.

With that, I fall asleep only to be woken by my door being banged on.

“Prez, we need to go. The Moretti’s have called an emergency meeting.” Blaze, my VP, says and I gr0an and sit up. I quickly get dressed. The Moretti’s this could be bad. But then again, Angel wouldn’t have told them anything, not unless she wants me to show her momma and daddy that she is a wh0re. I smirk as I leave my bedroom and walk through the clubhouse.

“What’s happened? Why are they calling this meeting?” I ask as a coffee is placed in front of me.

“We don’t know. I have tried to find out. All I’m being told is that it is urgent. We need to leave now,” he says, well you don’t need to tell me twice. No-one keeps the Moretti’s waiting. When they call, we move. My father Hatchet and Antonio had worked together for years. That’s how I met Angel.

They would come here or we would go to them. Even though she is four years younger than I am. We did used to have fun. Then, when Angel turned eighteen, the attraction grew between us and I took her first night. We were in a secret relationship up until those photos were delivered to me four weeks ago.

I said some pretty awful things to her when she caught me s3xing with Foxy; she needed to see that what I did were the consequences of her actions. Like the naïve little girl she is, she denied, and we argued. She slapped me, but I didn’t care and I don’t care. She got what she deserved.

I mount my bike alongside with Blaze and Ripper. He is my Sergeant At Arms. We head out of the compound and onto the road. We ride for a few hours before we arrive at the Moretti compound.

We pull up and climb down. Stepping into the mansion, the atmosphere is sombre. The other heads are here. I shake hands with them and they are all not sure why we have been summoned. But we don’t wait long.

Don Antonio Moretti walks into the room and we all nod our heads in respect to him. He looks like he has aged drastically, but then there is Teagan. She looks like she hasn’t slept and has cried. What the heck has happened?

“Thank you for coming at short notice. We appreciate it. Please sit,” Antonio speaks as he takes his seat and pulls a distraught Teagan onto his lap.

“We have called you all here, because our daughter, our Angel is missing.” My eyes widen and murmurs break out around the table. I look at Blaze and he glares at me. This won’t have anything to do with me. I’m sure she is just doing this for attention.

“How long has she been missing?” I ask and all eyes turn to me.

“A week. She hasn’t been herself for a while. The day she left, she told us she was going to the gym, she never came back. She drove her Mercedes to the bank and emptied all her accounts and closed them down. She then sold the car. We have no idea where she is. Her phone has either been discarded or she has turned it off. You all know our daughter. She is not a pampered, self entitled princess. She is not a spoilt brat. So for her to do this means she is in some kind of trouble.”

I gulp, not liking this one bit.

“There is one more thing. We believe we know the reason why she thought she needed to run away.” He looks at everyone, but his eyes land on me. I feel the blood freeze in my veins. Oh shet, he knows.

“She is also preqnant. We received something in the mail yesterday and I will say this. What we received had been fabricated. My team has already established this.”

“What did you receive?” One of the Don’s asked.

“Pictures of our daughter sleeping with different men. Whoever sent them is an amateur. Simon and Rosena established very quickly there were photo shopped. So it would seem the reason why our daughter ran is that she was being threatened with these images. Angel is a kind, gentle soul. We have teams already looking for her in every corner of the world.”

My heart is beating erratically. The pictures are fake? What the heck is going on?

“Do you know who the father is? Maybe she went to him?” I look at Blaze and he is fuming the same as I am. My fists clench under the table when Teagan looks at me and her gaze sends shivers down my spine and the sense of dread settles in my gut.

“We have an idea. The thing is, Angel would have tried to do the right thing. She would have gone to him to tell him. In my old line of work, I can tell you this: he has probably rejected her and her child. So she ran, not wanting to be a burden or to bring shame. Don’t forget ladies and gentlemen, my daughter is a DeNucci. We are famed for our skills in disappearing.” Teagan says, looking at me, and I gulp, shrinking into the chair.

That’s why she came. She came to tell me she was preqnant and like an idiot I am. I believed the photos and Foxy. I was drunk, but that is no effing excuse. My Angel, my goddess, is out there somewhere, no doubt scared, alone and preqnant with my child.

The rest of the meeting went by in a blur. I can see her tear-streaked face, the way her hand protected her belly. The way she was scared of me. The look of heartbreak on her beautiful face. She ran and is carrying my child.

END OF FLASHBACK.

“Savage, the next town we will be meeting up with Solomon. We need to move.” Blaze says to me. When my phone rings and I gr0an as I see the person calling me.

Foxy, I don’t answer the call. I never fricking do. I dumped her three months after I claimed her. I took it back when I found her being forked by two men from a different charter. I dragged her to the hospital to perform an ultrasound and surprise surprise the b1tch wasn’t fricking preqnant. She denied she was the one who sent the pictures. But I’m not silly. I know it was her.

“Ok, let’s move out.” I say as I leave the motel and we ride out. The search for Angel ended six months ago. Antonio and Teagan said Angel will return when she was good and ready and if she is found, she is not to be forced. Like he11 will that happen? If I find her, she and my kid are coming with me.

We ride to the town and pull up at the bar we are meeting Solomon. Solomon is the prez of the sister MC. We work closely together so this meet is nothing new but we have never met at this town before.

We step into the bar called Eclipse. It’s nice. It has that small town vibe going and I like it. The man behind the bar looks like he will pass out with the amount of us that has just walked in. I chuckle as he heads out to no doubt get someone to help him.

I mean, we are rowdy bikers, but we don’t start bar brawls; we are here to relax and to see Solomon, nothing more.

I hear a gasp and the rooms seem to quieten down. I turn and the image in front of me has me doing a double take.

Her long blonde hair is in a high ponytail, her honey eyes are wide. Her front is raising and falling rapidly. She is a vision. She is more beautiful than she was three years ago.

“Angel.”

Chapter 3

Angel POV.

They have found me; they have found me. Crap, frick, tvat! I look at him and I’m having a mini panic attack. All I can see is him and her. The words he spewed at me with such hatred and the smirk on her face. Why is he here?

He reaches for me and I react instantly; I grip his wrist and turn him, shoving his arm up his back. He gr0ans and the men are now on their feet. I look at Blaze, his VP, and he is telling everyone to remain calm.

“You have the wrong person. Now get out.” I shove him forward as the fight-or-flight takes over. I need to get out of here. I need to leave. I need to grab Rebel and Boomer and go. But where?

“Angel, that’s not going to happen. We have been looking for you. Your family has been looking for you. We have found you and there is no running from us,” Savage says to me as I step back, my eyes not leaving his.

“My name isn’t Angel. I don’t even know who you are. Now I won’t ask again. Get the fudge out of my bar or we will have a problem.” My voice is like steel as I stare the fricker down. I won’t back down now. I have to protect my daughter.

I catch movement from the corner of my eye and hold my hand up, and the movement stops. Just then, the door opens and more bikers come in. The momentary distraction causes me to act. I run for it. I run like my behind is on fire because it is. My hands are shaking as I run out of the side exit and towards my car. I drop the keys as I pick them up. I unlock the car when I’m grabbed and shoved into the side of my car. I scream when a large hand covers my mouth. The tears leave my eyes as I look into the icy blue orbs locked on me.

“Angel, please. I mean you no harm. Let me explain, please.” Like he11 I will. I bite down on his hand. He yells and moves away. I don’t think I bring my knee up hard, hitting him in his crown jewels the air leave him and he falls.

I open the car door and fumble with the keys and peel out of the parking lot. Tears blur my vision. I wipe them furiously away and ditch the car a few streets away and run to the house.

It won’t be long before he finds me again. I stop running and chuckle to myself. There is no use in running. He has found me and no doubt they will ask around town and will have my address soon. What can I do? ok think Angel. You can’t just pack up and leave in the middle of the night. You can’t uproot Rebel like that.

No, I will face the demons of my past head on. If he comes for me, which I know he will do. I will be ready for him. I’m a goddam Moretti and we don’t fricking run from our enemies and right now Savage and his MC are the enemy.

I turn back around and head back to the car, which is parked haphazardly, and I climb back inside. Pulling my phone from my pocket and fire off a quick text to Max, telling him to close up for the night and to not give any information about me to anyone.

He responds quickly, telling me they have gone and said they will be back to speak to you. I roll my eyes and sigh before I drive the car towards my house. I drum my fingers nervously against the steering wheel as I pull up outside my house.

The people of this town don’t know who I really am. It is safer that they don’t know. Even if the Moretti’s don’t have enemies. No one is brave or dorky enough to try anything. So I know either way I am safe, even if the Princes of Darkness have found me. They can’t touch me, not without retaliation from my family.

I leave the car and walk up the stone path to the front door. I open it and head inside. Rebel is awake and having a drink of milk on Mrs Lawson’s lap. They both look at me and I smile at them.

“You’re home early, everything ok?” I move forward and kiss my daughter on her head as she holds her foot drinking her bottle of milk. I kiss Mrs Lawson as well.

“Yeah, it wasn’t too busy, so I told Max to close it down and head home.” I only tell her part of the truth.

“You look like you have had a fright. What happened Angie?” I sigh as I stand and head to the kitchen and grab a bottle of bud and sit down on the sofa. One won’t hurt. I think I deserve it after what just happened.

“I need to tell you the truth about me. My name isn’t Angie, it’s Angel. Angel Moretti. My parents are Don Antonio Moretti and Teagan Moretti.” I say as I watch her and she nods her head slightly.

“I know dear. The whole town knows who you are. We aren’t simpletons. A few years ago, your family sent men here looking for you. We all told them we had no clue who you were. We knew you were running from something, so we choose to protect you. So tell me Angel, what happened tonight?”

I look at her, shocked. Hold on, back up. The whole town knows who I am? I chuckle in disbelief at this.

“Wow, well thank you.” she waves me off as Rebel waves her now empty bottle in the air like a flag. I chuckle at her as Mrs Lawson sets her down, and she toddles to me and I pick her up and cuddle her to my front and I know she will be asleep in a matter of moments.

“Her father found me tonight. Completely by coincidence. Her father is the president of the Princes of Darkness MC. His name is …”

“Ryder.” My eyes widen as I look at her and I gulp, nodding my head.

“How do you …”

“Hatchet is my brother. I moved out here, not long after Ryder was born. I left the MC life behind. My brother and I never stayed in touch after that. I will keep you both safe. I may no longer be part of that life, but that life remains in me. If he comes calling which he will do. You have to be ready. She is his child. The world of the MC is similar to your world. He has every right to claim her and when he does, you both will have to go with him. I’m sorry Angel.” She says to me.

I look down at my sleeping little girl and sigh, knowing I can’t run from this. Same as I can’t involve my family. He doesn’t know about her, so that is a good start.

Or at least I think he doesn’t. What have I got myself into?

Chapter 4

Angel POV.

I wake up to the sound of Rebel’s belly laughing.

I climb out of bed and yawn, stretching. I look down and I yarn, stuffing my b00b back inside my vest top. I rub my eyes as I stagger down the hallway to her room. Still sleepy, I didn’t get much sleep last night. I couldn’t settle, every time I closed my eyes. I saw his face. I look at my little girl who is sat on the floor playing with her blocks.

“Rebel.” I say in a singsong voice she turn her head to the sound, her hair sticking up in every direction kind of like mine right now. I chuckle as she stands up and runs to the baby gate. I lean over it and pick her up. Giving her kisses all over her face.

She is a happy baby, she always has been. Her tantrums, however, could frighten a hurricane away. She is explosive when she is having a moment. But on the whole, she is a happy girl.

“You hungry?” I reach for her head and try my best to smooth down the crazy professor hair. She nods her head and snuggles into the crook of my neck. I chuckle and pat her b0tt0m as I walk us both down the stairs.

Boomer lifts his head from his bed in the living room, his stump of a tail wags like crazy as he stands and follows me to the back door to be let out so he can use the bathroom. I get inside the bathroom by the back door and quickly change Rebel, wash my hands and pick her back up. Then I shuffle to her highchair and place her in it. I hand her a book and she bangs it against the tray.

“Ok little lady, what do you want for breakfast?” I ask her as I flick the kettle on and get to work making my coffee. It’s going to take a truckload to get me functioning this morning.

“Eggs, tost.” I chuckle dippy egg and toast it is. She is still learning to say words properly, but she is doing great. I get to work boiling the water for the eggs. I turn the TV on to some kids channel I turn the chair so she can see the TV in the living room. I drop the eggs into the water and get Boomer’s breakfast ready.

Once the eggs are ready, I let them cool slightly as I make her toast and butter them, cutting them into long strips for her to be able to hold.

I sit next to her watching her eat her breakfast. I smile as she gently picks up the long strip of toast and dips it into the gooey yolk. She does a little dance in her seat as she eats. I chuckle at her antics.

The doorbell sounds and I reach for my phone and check the camera. I gasp. Just great. It didn’t take him long. I ignore it for now. When he starts pounding on my door. Boomer growls and abandons his food as he walks towards the window.

“Angel, I know you are inside. Open the door, I just want to talk.” Boomer starts barking which causes Rebel to jump out of her skin. Can’t have a moment’s peace?

“Shhh sweetheart, it’s ok you eat your breakfast. Mommy is going to answer the door.” I tell her it’s a good thing she has finished her egg and is now eating her buttery toast.

I kiss her head and move to the door. Boomer stands in front of me and I grab his collar. I take a breath and open the door.

“What do you want, Savage?” he looks at me in surprise before he smirks at me. Duh, oh well, no point in hiding now.

“Just to talk Angel, please.” I roll my eyes as Boomer growls and I pull him back.

“We have nothing to talk about, Savage. I think you said everything that needed to be said three years ago. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m kind of busy.” I go to shut the door when his booted foot stops me.

“I want to see my child, Angel. You won’t keep me away.” My heart sinks. How does he know? Who fricking told him?

“I think we need to have that talk, don’t you?” he chuckles. I may hate him, but he is right. We do need to chat and I need to find out how he knows about her.

“Fine, meet me at the bar at one this afternoon. We will talk then.” I say and he smiles at me, his dimples on display. He steps back, and I shut the door. I lean against the door, resting my head against it, hearing the motorcycle drive off. Rebel squeals as she throws her toast on the floor. I sigh and push off the door as Boomer eats up what she has dropped.

“You, missy, need a bath.” I say with a chuckle, looking at her egg and toast covered mouth and face. She even has the toast in her hair. My little Rebel.

After she had a bath, well, I say bath; the bathroom was more like a swimming pool when she has finished. She is dressed in her little jeans and pink T-shirt with a glittery unicorn on the front. Her dark blonde hair is in little buns on the top of her head, she is also wearing her little pink converse.

I look at the clock and see it’s half-past twelve. I make her a quick snack and she eats it all. I grab the keys and Boomer and leave the house. I did contemplate keeping Rebel away from him, but there was no use in that. He knows about her now.

I head out when Scar walks up the path.

“Where are you both off to?” she asks, and I swear she has some kind of sixth sense or something.

“Savage came to the house this morning. He knows about Rebel and so I agreed to talk to him at the bar.” I tell her and she nods her head.

“Well then, it looks like we will be heading to the park then.” I look at her in confusion.

“It’s ok, I may as well rip the bandaid off and let him meet her.” I say to her and she nods her head with a small smile on her 1ips.

“You are doing the right thing, Angel. If you need me, give me a call and I will put him in his place.” She says, waving her fist and I laugh at her. Scar reminds me of momma. She is fearless and I adore her.

“Ok, I will keep that in mind. We have to go.” I say to her as I walk to the car and strap Rebel into her seat as Boomer sits next to her in the back.

We drive to the bar. I catch sight of his bike out front. The nerves kick up a gear as I park beside it. Careful to not scratch it or crash into it. Which wouldn’t be a bad idea. I chuckle evilly at the thought.

No Angel, you are not a child. I climb out of the car and to the back. I unclip Rebel and set her on the floor. Boomer jumps out and walks beside me. Here goes nothing.

I open the door to the bar and see Coral behind the bar who is making goo-goo eyes at Savage. I roll my eyes as I walk further in.

“Hey Angie,” I smile at her when I feel his eyes on me. I hold on to Rebel’s hand as I turn around.

He isn’t looking at me, no, he is looking at his daughter.

Chapter 5

Savage POV.

I stare into the honey coloured eyes of the little girl holding Angel’s hand. My heart stops and my knees weaken as she looks back at me. I feel the tears build in my eyes as she looks up at her mom and asks to be picked up. Angel smiles at her lovingly and picks her up, placing her on her h1p.

My daughter. Sod it, I have a daughter. I watch as she leans her little head against her mom’s shoulder, but doesn’t take her eyes off me. She is shy.

“Angel.” I choke out as she walks towards me. I keep my eyes on the little beauty as she watches me. I smile at her, but she hides her face away. My heart sinks. She doesn’t know who I am.

“Savage.” Her tone is anything but friendly. Not like how she used to call my name. No, that tone is long gone, and it’s my fault.

“Care for a drink?” she asks, and I shake my head as she moves to the bar and 0rders a soda. This is awkward. I catch my little girl peeking at me and I smile at her, but she hides again. Good girl, never speak to strangers. Even though I shouldn’t be a stranger to her but I am. That thought pierces my heart. She took my kid and had no intention of me ever knowing about her.

“Shall we sit down?” I nod my head as she walks past me to the booth and sits down. She places our daughter on her lap as the bar maid brings toys for her to play with.

“Thanks Coral. I will speak to you later on.” She says, dismissing her and we just look at each other. The atmosphere is palpable.

“What is her name?” I break the awkward stare off we are having. Angel bits her 1ip and looks at me.

“Rebel Carlotta Moretti. She has not long turned two years old.” She says, and I nod my head at her. I test her name on my togue Rebel. She looks up at her mom after hearing her name.

“Down.” she says and my soul leaves my body listening to her innocent little voice. Angel chuckles and kisses her on her head.

“Not right now, baby. Soon ok?” she says so softly to her and Rebel nods her little head and goes back to playing.

“So, how have you been?”

“I am not here to discuss pleasantries with you, Savage. How did you find out? I mean, I’m surprised you are even here.” She bites out. I shiver at the gaze coming from her.

“When you ran away, you mother and father called an emergency meeting. They knew you were qregnant and why you ran. They also had those pictures sent to them. I’m sorry I didn’t believe you, Angel.”

She scoffs, looking away, shaking her head as she shucks on her teeth and I know I have a lot of grovelling to do.

“Yeah, well, why would you? It doesn’t matter now. What’s done is done. How’s your ole lady?” she asks, and I stiffen and shake my head. I have caused this damage and I need to fix it.

“I don’t have one. I rescinded my claim on her after I found her in a compromising position. She was never preqnant.” She rolls her eyes and stifles a laugh.

“No, really, shocking.” She says sarcastically as she drinks her soda.

“Look, I know, drop the attitude. You should have told me, but instead you ran away and kept her from me!” I snap at her, which causes her to place the glass down calmly, and I gulp as she watches me.

“What do you want, Savage?” she asks like she is bored with me, which I know she isn’t. She thinks she can act all tough, but I know her. I know she is not like this. Angel is kind, gentle, loving. She is the purest person I know. So seeing her like this is like a dagger to my heart.

“You are both coming back with me. I Ryder ‘Savage’ Jackson, president of the Princes of Darkness MC. Claim you both as mine.” Her eyes widen before she laughs out loud, shaking her head. Wiping her tears from her eyes and Rebel laughs too. The sound is beautiful. Rebel claps because her mom is laughing.

“Ohhh, Savage, Savage, Savage. Nice try. You see, you can’t claim us. I am a Moretti and that trumps whatever you have just tried to do. Does my father no not my father? Does my momma know you are the reason her only daughter fled?” Now I laugh at her, which causes her to stop dead as she watches me.

“Hate to beak it to you, princess, but yes, they do. I got a beating and a lovely scar on my leg from the bu11et she shot at me. They also know I have found you both. You Angel Maria Moretti are coming with me. Whether I have to drag you kicking and screaming. You have run for too long, princess.”

Her eyes widen and I smirk like a smug fricker. No running away now.

“Fine, we will go back. But I won’t be stepping foot in your clubhouse. I will go home with her and we can arrange visitation. I will not have her around your club or the women you have there. Take it or leave it, Ryder. Because from where I am sitting you are lucky to be alive,” she says and I laugh out loud at that. Oh, man, she doesn’t get it.

“What’s funny? Those are the terms. We are nothing, Ryder, and we will never be again. This is about her and her only. I don’t care about you or your club. She is my priority and if I say she isn’t to be around your club and b1tches, then that is what will happen or you can walk away now and forget you ever saw her.” She bites out and I stop laughing and growl at her.

“I have claimed you both, so I’m sorry to break it to you, Angel. But you are both coming back to with me, and that’s final. Your mom and dad are aware of this. They will be meeting us there in two day’s time. So get with the programme. You won’t be staying in the clubhouse. You have your own house ready for you both to move it. Yes, they move fast and you know this,” I tell her and she stands up with Rebel in her arms.

“Screw you!” She glares down at me before she turns and walks out of the bar. Rebel waves her little hand at me over her mom’s shoulder and I wave back, giving her a little wink.

She won’t get away from me that easily. Whether she likes it or not, I always get what I want. Oh Angel, you have no idea who you are playing with, princess.

I pull my phone from my pocket and dial the one person who will bring her in and she will hate me for it, but I need the big guns to tame her. She was never like this and I know I’ve said this before. She is now fierce and stubborn. She is acting like a spoilt little rich girl.

“Give her time, whatever you did, give her time. She has never acted like this before.” The bar maid says as she picks up the empty glass and toys. I nod my head as I watch the door.

“Please tell me she is coming home?”

“She is stubborn and has refused. She is playing hardball.”

“Leave her to me.” the call ends and I sigh before I pocket the phone and walk out to my bike. I see her car driving in the direction of her home. Putting my helmet on, I straddle my bike and start her up

I’ve been having problems with my stomach and gestation since I remember, but my mom was against doctors (still is…) and always told me that I am just the type to be nervous…
Maybe that is true, that is not only lactose but also stressed induce. 
I went to gastro doctor because its been three months since I got diagnosed with serious Hashimoto (autoimunne disease of thyroid) where is recommended to cut gluten or dairy to feel better. So I ordered gastroenterologist appointment, he knew (thank god!) that having autoimunne disease can relate to gastro problems or developing other AID like Crohn or celiatic…) he ordered full blood panel for everything and while drawing my blood they were like lets make LI breath test. 
Ive got my whole life cramps, diarrhea, extreme bloating (looking pregnant), farting… and I ve never stopped eating dairy. 
It was like : 2 cups of coffee with milk, vanilla cottage for breakfast, something with cheese/feta/pizza icecream with cream with daughter and…. 
I am realizing now, I have been slowly killing myself.
The nurse gave me to drink 50gr of lactose for the tesr. The normal number is around 20, my was 220 after 90 minutes of digesting it. She stopped the test that its pretty much obvious. 
I went to work and worked thhrough 8 hour episode of cramping, diarrhea (6x in works bathroom stall) and nausea.. they did not give me anything to settle my stomach. But waiting at the doctor I started to have reflux/heartburn cramps and bowel movements like I have my whole life… so maybe I have been intoleranr for xy years? 
The nurse ordered STRICT DIET to avoid everything, but I know sometimes I had days I ate a lot of lactose and I was ok, but Im not gonna risk it (maybe I was less okay than I think…)

I just maybe want some of your wisdom and outlook. Its been heart to be diagnosed with Hashimoto, being fired (for sloppy job due to brain fog and extreme tiredness from hashimoto) and now this… 
I am afraid they will find something with gluten and… I dont know what to est how to cope.

My boyfriend also father works and owns a buisness, manual labor type jobs. Usually, we will call him Jeremy, wakes up before us and makes himself bacon and eggs. He has been dumping the bacon grease in the toilet, flushing it and wiping the pan out with a paper towel. And then he will leave and go to work. I have asked him to stop dumping the bacon grease in the toilet many times because it is for one, just gross and makes the seat feel greasy, and two it coats the toilet bowl and then i have to clean it out everyday. Yesterday, he did it again. This is after I told him to just put it in the jar that i keep in the fridge. I said that it was going to be his turn to clean out the toilet, however I ended up doing it. Then this morning our son and I woke up early so we were awake when Jeremy was making breakfast. He asked me if I wanted some food and I said yes. His little brother was also at our house. So Jeremy makes everyone breakfast.  Then he promptly says he has to leave, with the entire mess still out. I tell him no and I get him the jar out of the fridge and he gets mad, he is running late, he doesn't get to spend enough time with our son, I should want to help him out, he was being nice making me breakfast.His little brother chimes in ""you'll be home all day you'll have time.""  ""What do you have you do, get coffee?"" Jeremy is saying ""you see how she treats me"" So my boyfriend dumps the grease in the jar, wraps the bacon and just leaves. Mind you, everyday he throws his egg shells in the sink and leaves them for me,  he doesn't wipe the grease or egg off of anything,  he doesn't put up the butter, salt or pepper, or throws away the bacon grease covered paper towels.  He will rinse off his plate about 75% of the time. Whatever. him and his brother both left their egg covered plates on the porch. He calls me and I was like ""ready to apologize?"" And he goes ""yeah you're right, I am sorry. Sorry I dont have a ""wife"" that will help me out. Even when she knows im rrunning late and that i won't get to spend time with our son and that I'll be in the hot sun all day."" He swears up and down that he always cleans up after himself. And i really think he believes that dumping the grease and wiping the pan out with a paper towel is cleaning up because he just doesn't see what I have to do. I make three meals everyday and always. ALWAYS. clean up. He leaves a mess every morning that i clean up and I dont say anything because I understand he is busy. This just made me feel like I was being used and that it is jsut expected of me. He won't even wash sippy cups if I ask him to. Idk. He is still super mad at me and is acting like im just a terrible person and I always complain and I never help him. He DOES work hard, but I do all of the house work. He is so mad, but i feel like he doesn't even have much ground to stand because he would have dumped the grease (in the toilet) and put the bacon up if i was still sleeping like every other day. Idk.

available to all team members.
This notice is to inform you that your position may be affected and you may be placed on a
reduced schedule. It is important to note that your employment continues to be at will and
nothing in this notice or other communications is intended as an express or implied contract.
We know that this reduction of hours has a financial impact on you. You may be eligible for
partial unemployment benefits if you experience reduced hours. You can file a claim by going to

a claim. Additionally, forms outlining the reduced
hours are available with GM or HR. These forms can help expedite
your claim processing. HR is also available with open office hours on 6/11 from
2:30-3:30pm, or by request.
We will continue your health insurance benefits during this furlough (if you are enrolled). To
ensure the continuity of coverage, you will need to make the standard premium deduction that
we have previously done through payroll. Should you owe more than your paycheck we will
provide you with a statement for payment.
As a leadership team, we have also reviewed our other expenses and will be working to
manage those closely. We are implementing some changes like removing coffee from the
rooms as part of this process. We are targeting smaller changes that will keep our costs down, but maintain the guest service that our guests know and love. Many of our programming
partners, like wineries, will still be on property to Create Delight for our guests. If you have any
questions or concerns about these changes, please speak with me so that I can help you
navigate how to answer guest comments or questions around these changes.
We are here to support and care for you and I encourage you to call or email me, COO, or
HR if you have any questions about this process.
Sincerely,GM

If you or a loved one has been injured or has legal concerns, don’t wait until it's too late — call [**Schwartzapfel Lawyers**](https://fightingforyou.com/) now at **516-342-2200** for your free consultation and so much more.

**The Myth Of The Frivolous Lawsuit**  
Susan Saladoff's [*Hot Coffee*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY70a4CJgDE) (2011) opens with the infamous case of [*Liebeck v. McDonald’s*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) (1994), which the media painted as the poster child for frivolous litigation. The reality, however, is far more sobering.

Stella Liebeck suffered third-degree burns and required skin grafts. But the bigger injury was done to public perception. The case became a tool used by powerful interests to promote tort reform — legal changes that limit the ability of injured individuals to recover fair compensation.

Put simply, this was never just about coffee. It was about whether everyday people can get a fair shot at justice when they're seriously hurt.

**Who Benefits From Tort Reform?**  
The film makes clear what many don’t realize: tort reform isn’t a grassroots movement, but a top-down campaign driven by corporate lobbying.

Caps on damages, as seen in [*Gourley v. Nebraska Methodist Health System*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1035096085453140871) (2003), don’t hurt negligent actors — they hurt victims and their families. It’s all clever wording over real truth; phrases like “lawsuit abuse” are used to hide the fact that these changes make it harder for regular people to hold others accountable in court.

Cases like [*Jones v. Halliburton*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7577487418616160071) (2008) reveal how forced arbitration strips individuals of their right to a public trial.

Meanwhile, judicial elections influenced by special-interest money, such as in the case of [Oliver Diaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_E._Diaz_Jr), illustrate how tort reform is weaponized through politics, *not* principle. In this way, these reforms don’t streamline justice — they suppress it.

But I can definitely say na hulog ako sayo to turn a blind eye to those gut feelings. And i was wrong for doing that, it caused me huge damage.

Still, I can say that God is good. I found out on May 27 that you cheated on me, it's when I arrived via bus from CDO to Apokon, Tagum (apartment mo). There was that unexplanable feeling na i was being cheated with, so i opened your laptop and logged in your facebook and to my surprise, it was not just a feeling, it was real - you and that guy were talking about the deed on April 17 (which was also the day i arrived on apokon, i messaged you that I'll go to don benitos to buy you pichi pichi kasi you're craving) while you guys are messaging about ""creampie"". I can still remember that holy week, kasi there were a lot of memories, the first night I arrived, was the second time you guys fuck sa apartment before you went to work, then I picked you up with the motorcyle i rented in davao (as I'm not from tagum and only been visiting cuz of her), I could still remember you telling me, it's your first time riding a motorcyle with someone (na dili habal2) but that guy, after you guys fuck, hinatid ka going to work on that same day I picked you up after work kasi 8 hrs duty ka that month of April. Then, we went on a coffee shop, ordered some drinks and passed thru to Mcdo for food and eat outside sa new cityhall while we were talking about us. Later that, we decided sa aprtment na ako matulog haha (same sheets, same pillow). You guys continued to talk the whole month and im not sure if yun lang ba kasi there's no way of me knowing na since you deleted the whole convo. Akala ko si Rap lang, funny because there's Janus on May, then I tried so hard to make you tell me everything.. only for me to realize na every time we had fights and arguments, moments na i thought was just plainly space for us to think and process things, was you distracting yourself from guys. You definitely changed me and how i see people.

Everything hurts. I couldn't imagine how you're able to look me in the eyes and tell me how much you love me and would take care of me someday, how you teased me about me buying a ring with your preferences, the house we would build someday, and future international travels - as if you weren't cheating behind my back. You were a person who's so big on ""I deserve this treatment, I deserve to be chosen, to be valued, and to be love"" but seriously, you don't seem like you understand what you're saying.

I decided to reach out to two of your girl exes (kasi one guy lang daw naging bf nya the whole life haha but body count nya sa men way way more than sa girl exes nya), figured out you cheated to the both of them. But while we were trying to understand why you did what you did, you only told me, you were MAD AT ME that time, that you were hurting, that you felt i was cheating on you. But boy, you made a fool out of me, when you told me you were single way back in 2023 and your third gf told me you guys only broke up in April 2024. LOL

We first met in Manila in May 2024 - you were single at the time, but the tickets were bought when you were in a relationship. We freaking did videocalls, sleepcalls, updates whole time you're in a freaking relationship. Ang galing, di ba? It's a PATTERN.

Tapos, sasabihin mo lang sa akin ngayon you were mad at me that's why nagawa mo yun - which by the way, you didnt considered cheating kasi nga you broke up with me April 11, 2025 around 3pm and you and Rap fucked on April 11 12am LOL you even sent a screenshot on discord to make yourself right. The audacity! You are a narcissist, manipulator, and cheater!

And now, you want to go back to our lovey-dovey state. I chose to forgive you that day I found out you cheated on me. But, as the days passed, you made me realize you weren't really that sincere; you just got caught. Kasi, even after I gently and patiently asked you what really happened, you had to lie about everything, you shifted the blame to Eris and Rap, and I mistakenly believed you kasi nga sobrang bait ng pakakilala ko sayo. I believed that you were just influenced, nabigyan ng gagong advice, nadala sa people around you and you even told me about Eris being an educator but ""complete mess"" as she's targeting students and that Rap was a complete liar, social climber, and that he forced he's way into you (don sa tagum), and that you only wanted to have a friend to talk but he provoked you to do those things. I was able to talk to Rap about it, and his words make more sense to me than yours. Mabuti pa sya nagsabi ng totoo, if not for him, i wouldn't be able to confirm the timeline kasi ALL he knew was you're already single and that you already blocked me and deleted all the convos. Potcha! Comfort?? 2-3 hours before your duty? Talk in person? Really? Not call? But meetup on your freaking apartment for comfort galing davao pa yung si Rap? I know, I'm so dumb to believe her, I was just foolishly in love with a person disguised as a sheep.

May you never find someone like us who you can easily make believe that you're a freaking saint - healed and changed person, but no, you were just looking for a perfect timing to hunt, that's why gusto mo makipag hiwalay kasi you were already plotting a new season sa buhay mo - fubu series.

I just hated the part where you have to use someone, hurt someone, and make a fool of us. Wag kang maggamit ng babae, if you want a guy and their ""thing"" be honest ka sa sarili mo, wag kang manggago.

Mind you, the whole week, she's the one who's crying ""outside"" like people can see her. Kawawa ka naman, people are comforting her and giving all sorts of sympathy. Sige lang, di naman bulag ang Diyos eh, siya nlang bahala sayo. I hope na enjoy mo manira ng buhay and pagiging ""victim"" sa sarili mong kasalanan.

Also, hindi ka ba na de vaju? Your second ex told me you brought a guy sa bhouse you both stayed (but technically it's yours) and all you told me you were single at that time and there was no cheating. And now, di mo alam anong gagawin mo, you felt lost and shit. But seriously, pano mo nagawa yung sex with him, how can you let other touch you, kiss and do it raw pa gyud with him? He even told me how wild you were kasi he was angry about the part na ""he force you daw"" when in fact, you invited him. Nag delete ka kasi ng convo, siya wala eh.

I don’t remember it doing that, and it would actually be fine, but it’s not doing it correctly for me. 

Notice when the card is out that the blue arrow (my car) is over the left side of the street name (and noticeably left of center). When the card is hidden the arrow is over the right side of the street name but more centered. 

I took some measurements and with the card hidden the blue arrow is 177.5mm from the left edge of the screen. That puts it exactly center of the entire screen (which includes the 4 icons on the right side plus a little extra space.

When the card is shown, the arrow is 135mm from the left edge which puts it exactly center if measured from the LEFT edge of the 4 icons.

Obviously, the calculations for the street name are done differently because it moves a different amount and is not aligned with the arrow. Please AT LEAST align the arrow and the street name so they match!

I have about $300k I could use for these efforts and just dropping into an index fund and collecting 10% would be great, but cash flow would also be nice. Tell me which of these are stupid. It seems like it should be possible to do nearly all of these with minimal capital outlays and a lot of these seem like marketing/awareness is the biggest hurdle with minimal price elasticity.

* Property management - grow existing business by paying for marketing/PR (currently running services only, and only growing via word of mouth, I do not own any rental properties, just collect between 6-15% of monthly rent rolls and take care of everything else for about 4-8 hours per month of my time)
* Laundromat with wash/dry/fold services (live in a major university town)
* Light construction equipment rental (huge demand I recently discovered by accident while trying to rent stuff myself)
* Mobile coffee trailer (pop up on weekend farmers markets, fairs/festivals, add baked goods and other higher margin make-ahead products to supplement coffee - I know the coffee industry quite well and understand common pitfalls, hence why I’d prefer a mobile operation to even attempt it)
* Ice vending machines (also live near several major lakes with huge recreation areas)
* Vending machines in general (aunt did this with loads of success in the 90s, but unsure if it’s still viable in 2025 with many corporations owning contracts these days)

1l9cnuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceMaster/comments/1l9cnuw/on_ai_and_voice_actors_how_pocholo_gonzales_is/,On AI and voice actors: How Pocholo Gonzales Is cloning himself so his voice can work while he sleeps,"# In an age where AI has voice actors on edge, the Philippines’ “VoiceMaster” is already training the bots himself.

I met Pocholo Gonzales about twenty years ago. It was the dawn of Web 1.5, considered the precursor years to social media, a time when the Internet was slowly entering its wireless phase in coffee shops, and of course the invention of the word “podcasting” thanks to the iPod. He was an industry pioneer, bringing voices online into the digital space. Into iTunes. Into YouTube. It was more than just the dubbing and recording for commercials. I think he, like many other tech luminaries at that time, saw the Internet as the great equalizer for talent. 

Pocholo, blessed with a face that never seems to age, has a voice that follows suit. If you’ve never seen him in person, you’ve probably heard his voice – or his voices: he’s been the VO dubbing talent and director behind popular shows and characters like Meteor Garden, Kuro Chan, Kaiju No. 8, Gaslight District, Murder Drones, among others.

I’ve kept in touch with the man throughout the years and I was really curious to know, in this age of AI and voice cloning, where he stands in the industry. Does he defend the craft and profession of voice artists like himself citing AI ethics, or is he of the more ”‘progressive” sink or swim type. His influence and leanings bear weight in the industry, as he’s trained over 10,000 artists to find and own their voices through CreatiVoices Productions and the Certified Voice Artist Program (CVAP).

After speaking to him I’ve come to realize there’s a deeper conversation to be had, and it has to do more with voice artists being comfortable with lending out their voices, cloning themselves into literally what AI could be doing for your profession. While many creatives are still wondering if AI will take their jobs, Pocholo “The VoiceMaster” Gonzales is already years ahead—because his AI voice is literally working for him while he sleeps.

In the age of AI, which literally just happened during the latter part of the pandemic, his voice has already been used millions of times worldwide, and he isn’t losing sleep over it. In fact, he’s leaning into AI so hard, he cloned his own voice through ElevenLabs and made it teach, host, and inspire on-demand.

“Imagine—Pocholo, on repeat, and on purpose,” he told me. “This isn’t ego. It’s my legacy powered by AI.”

It’s a bold, unapologetic pivot in an industry where most artists are still cautiously toeing the line between fear and fascination. But for Pocholo, AI didn’t kill voice acting—it exposed who’s coasting and who’s creating.

“AI didn’t end VO,” he says. “It ended mediocrity.”

# Your voice is a product

Voice acting in the AI era is no longer about booking gigs—it’s about building digital products. Think voice clones, teaching tools, AI hosts, dataset creation, and licensing your likeness.

“Kung boses lang ang kaya mong ibenta, maghanda ka,” he says. “But if you have a message and a mindset, AI will amplify you.” (If all you can sell is your voice, you better prepare for the worst. But if you have a message and a midset, AI will amplify you.)

Working together with ElevenLabs, a service that offers AI voice overs and voice-activated assistants, Pocholo helped create the first AI voices that actually sound like real Filipinos—not some neutral English accent with a vague Southeast Asian tone.

“Before, yung Filipino voice parang extra lang. Now? Headline. And I made sure of that. I fought to put our rhythm, accent, and story into the global AI voice library. Ngayon, may AI voices na nagsasabing “Tara na!” at “Kaya mo ‘yan!”—at tunog totoong Pinoy.” (Before, the Filipino voice was an oversight. An extra. I fought to put our rhythm, accent, and story in the global AI voice library. Now, we have AI voices that can say “let’s go!” or “you can do it! And it really sounds authentic.)

I realized that I’ve actually used these voices. I’ve been an ElevenLabs paid subscriber for a while and have used their library of voices for VO for event coverages. I had no idea this effort – this advocacy was started by him. I was able to find really good Filipino VO’s that have the signature Filipino accents in English. They’re scary-accurate. I’ve included a sample of what I’m talking about below.

>

# When tech outpaces legislation

While discussions around AI ethics and copyright continue, Pocholo is all about adaptation over hesitation. “Bureaucracy is dial-up,” he tells me. “AI is 5G.” In short—if you’re waiting for the system to protect you, you’re already obsolete.

That’s why at CVAP, he teaches voice artists how to license their voice, own their IP, and evolve into voice entrepreneurs. Because as far as he’s concerned, legislation may come and go, but ownership is everything.

“Your growth,” he says, “will always be your greatest protection.”

# Clone wars

In a time when many creatives feel threatened by machines, Pocholo Gonzales has flipped the script. He doesn’t see AI as a rival—it’s his distribution partner. And that’s the difference.

Where others see competition, he sees scale.

Where others see extinction, he sees evolution.

“I always say, voice isn’t just for entertainment,” he tells me. “It’s for education. It’s for transformation.”

And now, it’s for immortality.

I woke up this morning and I had actually pushed through my plateau. I'm also getting a lot of support from my roommates who is also trying to avoid eating before sleep so I go to bed a little bit hungry every time. But I try to eat a lot during the day. Today I had two protein pancakes with a little bit of jam a little bit of maple syrup and a lot of fruit. Along with a protein coffee. That was just breakfast.  So my calories are right there at my deficit but I still get so hungry before bed. 

Still not craving sugar which makes me happy. I let myself eat up to two dates a day. And sometimes I'll let myself have a small chocolate bar if I really really want it but nine out of 10 times I go past those aisles without much interest. They had a biscoff flavored kit Kat last week and I was very curious but it just tasted very much similar to regular kit kat. It's also taken me a week and a half to finish off a pint of Halo top. And I mostly add a tbsp of it to coffee as a low calorie frappuccino replacement when I don't want it black. 


Honestly I still am amazed at my lack of obsession considering I've craved sweets since I was 9 years old.  I mean it's one thing if I'm avoiding it entirely going cold turkey but preferring other more natural foods blows my mind. I'm like the kid that can't believe that they are capable of riding a two-wheel bicycle instead of a tricycle. Do I fall off the wagon now? What about now? Am I addicted to sugar yet?

I Should Have Said No.,"This all started about 16 years ago when Rachel left me. Not that I blame her – I was a mess back then. Hell, I'm still a mess now, just a different kind of mess. We'd been together for four years, and I thought we were going to get married. I had the ring and everything. But apparently, my opinions on ""taking things slow"" and her opinions on ""building a future together"" were two very different things.

After she moved out, I pretty much became a hermit. I work as a freelance developer, mostly building AI algorithms for tech companies, so I was already working from home most days. It was easy to just... stop leaving. I'd order groceries online, get everything delivered, and spend my days coding and my nights drinking cheap beer while scrolling through Netflix.

The only place I'd go was Murphy's, this little dive bar around the corner from my apartment. Even then, it was just to sit alone, nurse a couple of Budweisers, and pretend I was being social. The bartender, Jimmy, knew my order and knew not to bother me with small talk. It was perfect.

My mom would call every few days, asking when she could come visit or when I was coming home for dinner. My friends would text about hanging out, grabbing drinks, going to concerts. I ignored most of it. It was easier to just stay in my bubble and feel sorry for myself. Rachel had moved on – I could see her Instagram posts of her new life, new boyfriend, new everything. Meanwhile, I was wearing the same sweatpants for three days straight and eating cereal for dinner.

That's when he showed up.

It was a Tuesday in March, around 2 PM. I remember because I was in the middle of debugging some neural network code when the doorbell rang. I almost didn't answer it – I wasn't expecting any deliveries, and I definitely wasn't in the mood for Jehovah's Witnesses or solar panel salesmen.

But something made me get up and look through the peephole.

He was tall, maybe in his fifties, wearing an expensive-looking gray suit that probably cost more than my rent. Perfectly groomed silver hair, the kind of confident smile that made you trust him immediately. He looked like he belonged in a boardroom, not standing outside my shitty apartment building.

I opened the door, probably looking like I'd been living in a cave for months, which wasn't far from the truth.

""Mr. Walker?"" His voice was smooth, professional.

""Yeah, that's me. Can I help you?""

""I certainly hope so. My name is Mr. Blackwood, and I have a proposition that might interest you."" He glanced past me into my apartment, taking in the empty beer bottles, the clothes draped over furniture, the general disaster that was my life. ""May I come in?""

Everything in my brain was screaming that this was wrong, but there was something about his presence that made me step aside and let him in. He sat down on my couch like he owned the place, completely unfazed by the mess.

""Mr. Walker, I'll get straight to the point. I represent certain... interested parties who are conducting a social experiment. We're looking for individuals who might be willing to participate in an extended isolation study.""

""Isolation study?""

""Quite simple, really. You would agree to remain inside your residence for exactly one year. No leaving, not even to step outside for fresh air. No exceptions whatsoever. In exchange, you would receive one million dollars upon successful completion.""

I stared at him for a long moment, waiting for the punchline.

""You're serious...""

""Completely. You can continue working, use the internet, order anything you need for delivery. The only requirement is that you cannot physically leave this apartment for 365 consecutive days.""

A million dollars. I made decent money coding, but a million dollars would change everything. I could pay off my student loans, my credit cards, maybe even buy a house. And honestly, the way I'd been living for the past few months, I was basically already doing it for free.

""What's the catch?""

Mr. Blackwood smiled. ""No catch. Simply a year of your life in exchange for financial freedom. We'll provide you with a direct deposit of $50,000 upfront to cover any expenses, and the remaining $950,000 upon completion.""

He pulled out a contract from his briefcase. It was surprisingly short – just two pages of legal language that basically said I couldn't leave my apartment for a year, and if I did, I'd forfeit the money and have to pay back the advance.

I should have asked more questions. I should have wondered who these ""interested parties"" were, or why they'd pay someone a million dollars to stay home. But I was depressed, broke, and honestly? The idea of having an excuse to avoid the world for a while sounded perfect.

I signed the contract.

To be honest, the first few months were actually amazing. The $50,000 hit my account before I had even woken up the next day, and suddenly I could afford good food, better beer, all the video games and streaming services I wanted. I threw myself into work with a new enthusiasm, taking on bigger projects and making more money than I'd ever made before.

My friends thought I was crazy when I told them about the deal, but most of them were also kind of jealous. ""Dude, you're getting paid a million dollars to do what you were already doing,"" my buddy Marcus said during one of our video calls. ""That's the easiest money ever.""

Even my mom was supportive, though she worried about my mental health. ""Just promise me you'll call if you need anything, honey. And maybe try to eat some vegetables once in a while.""

I started talking to myself around month four, but it didn't feel weird. Just little comments while I was coding, or narrating what I was doing while cooking. ""Alright, let's see if this algorithm actually works this time."" Normal stuff. Everyone talks to themselves sometimes, right?

The hardest part was the loneliness that would hit at random moments. I'd be having a great day, crushing some coding project, and then I'd see a photo on social media of my friends hanging out without me, and it would feel like a punch to the gut. But I had video calls, texting, social media. I wasn't completely cut off from the world.

When the year was up, Mr. Blackwood returned exactly as promised. He handed me a check for $950,000 with that same professional smile.

""Congratulations, Mr. Walker. I trust the experience wasn't too difficult?""

""Actually, it was easier than I expected.""

""Excellent. In that case, I have another proposition for you.""

My heart started racing. I'd been dreading this moment ending, going back to the real world, figuring out what to do with my life.

""Five more years, Mr. Walker. Same rules, same apartment. In exchange, ten million dollars.""

Ten million dollars. Fuck. That was retire-early, never-work-again money. That was buy-a-house-in-cash, travel-the-world money. And honestly, I'd gotten pretty comfortable with my setup. Five years would fly by.

I signed the second contract without hesitation...

The first year of the five-year deal went smoothly. I was making great money with my coding work, I'd settled into a routine, and I was actually happier than I'd been since Rachel left. I'd lost some weight, started working out in my apartment, even tried meditation. My friends joked that isolation was the best thing that ever happened to me.

But then things started going wrong.

It was during year two that Rachel called. I saw her name on my phone and almost didn't answer, but curiosity got the better of me.

""Hey, David."" Her voice was exactly the same, and it hit me like a freight train.

""Rachel… Hi. I wasn’t expecting to hear from you.""

""I know this is random, but I've been thinking about you lately. About us. I was wondering if maybe we could get lunch sometime? Just to talk, you know? I think I... ***we*** both made some mistakes.""

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. This was what I'd been hoping for, dreaming about, for years. She wanted to try again. But...

""I... I can't.""

""You can't? Are you... seeing someone?""

""No, it's not that. I just... I literally can't leave my apartment right now. It's complicated.""

There was a long silence.

""David, what the hell are you talking about? Are you under house arrest or something?""

I tried to explain about the deal, the money, how I only had three more years left. But even as I said it, I could hear how insane it sounded.

A few deafeningly quiet moments passed before she finally responded, ""You’re still exactly the same, aren’t you? Choosing money over us? Over the chance to fix what we had?""

""It's not that simple, Rachel. It's ten million dollars. Think about what we could do with that kind of money. We could—""

""I can't believe you right now. I thought maybe you'd changed, but you're still just a weak little man-child who refuses to take responsibility for anything.""

She hung up. I called back seventeen times. She never answered.

That night, I sat in my apartment and cried for the first time since she'd left. But I didn't break the contract. Three more years, I told myself. Three more years and I'd have enough money to win her back, to prove that I could provide for her, for us.

In year three, my mom called with news that made all of my veins freeze.

""Honey, I need to tell you something. I went to the doctor last week for my annual checkup… and they found a lump in my breast. They're doing more tests, but they think it might…"" her voice faded into an orchestra of muffled chaos as her words sunk in.

The world stopped. My mom was only fifty-eight. She was supposed to have decades left. She was supposed to meet my future kids, see me get married, grow old gracefully.

“Do you think that nice gentleman would understand, and let you come home for a while, sweetie?” her voice cracked.

I paused for a moment. My breath became short as I weighed the options. 10 million dollars is so much to abandon, especially if the tests were to come back benign… but it’s my mom. I could feel the tears welling up in my cheeks, moving toward my eyes. I must have been silent for a little too long as I decided, because she felt the need to interject.

“No, it’s fine. Forget I asked at all. I’m sorry, honey. I shouldn’t have put you through that kind of stress. You’ve been working really hard, and who knows – with that kind of money, you’d be able to afford any treatment, even from God himself!” She tried to laugh.

She made me promise not to break the contract. Against every instinct in my body, I stayed in my apartment.

The cancer was aggressive. Stage three by the time they caught it. I watched my mom fight through video calls, seeing her get thinner and weaker with each round of chemo. I sent her money for the best treatments, the most expensive doctors, but it wasn't enough.

My friends stopped calling as much. Marcus got married in year four – I watched the wedding through a livestream he set up for me. ""It's not the same without you here, man,"" he said during our call afterwards. ""Sarah asks about you all the time. She thinks you've lost your mind.""

Maybe I had. I was talking to myself constantly now, having full conversations with imaginary people. I'd argue with my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I'd narrate my entire day out loud just to hear a human voice, even if it was my own.

""Okay, David, time to make some coffee. Ethiopian beans today, because we're feeling fancy. Aren't we feeling fancy? Yes, we are definitely feeling fancy.""

I started leaving the TV on 24/7 just to have background noise, background voices. I knew every episode of The Office by heart. I could recite entire scenes from Friends. These fictional people became more real to me than my actual friends and family.

My mom died on a Tuesday in February. Year five, day 364. One day before my contract was up.

I got the call from my aunt Linda at 6:47 AM. ""She fought so hard, David. Right up until the end, she kept talking about how proud she was of you, how excited she was to see you when you finished your project.""

I hung up the phone and screamed until my throat was raw. I put my fist through the bathroom mirror. I threw my laptop across the room and watched it shatter against the wall.

But I didn't leave. I couldn't leave. Not with one day left. Not when I was so close.

Mr. Blackwood showed up exactly twenty-four hours later, at 6:47 AM. He handed me a check for ten million dollars.

""My condolences on your recent loss, Mr. Walker.""

Of course he knew.

I was about to tell him to go fuck himself when he smiled and continued.

""I have one final proposition for you. Ten more years. Same arrangement. But this time, we'll make it worth your while. One hundred million dollars.""

One hundred million dollars. Now that was some real ""fuck you money"". Enough money to buy anything, go anywhere, do whatever I wanted. Enough money to make sure my mom's death wasn't for nothing. Enough money to win Rachel back, to show her what I'd accomplished.

""Why?"" I asked. ""Why me? Why any of this?""

""Because you're very, very good at it, Mr. Walker. Most people break by year two. You've made it five years and you're still... functional.""

I looked around my apartment. My self-prescribed tomb. My prison. My home.

""Ten years?""

""Ten years.""

I signed the third contract.

The next decade was a blur of darkness. I stopped working – what was the point? With the upfront deposits and previous checks, I had enough money to last multiple lifetimes. I stopped showering regularly, stopped cleaning, stopped caring about anything. I'd sleep for sixteen hours a day and spend the other eight staring at screens, watching other people live their lives.

Rachel got married. I saw the photos on Facebook before I finally deleted all my social media accounts. She looked happy. Radiant. Everything I could have given her, if I hadn't been so fucking greedy.

Marcus and Sarah had three kids. I watched them grow up through Christmas cards and sporadic texts that eventually stopped coming altogether. They stopped asking when I'd be done with my ""project."" They stopped asking about me at all.

I started seeing things that weren't there. Shadows moving in my peripheral vision. Voices calling my name from the hallway outside my door. Sometimes I'd spend hours talking with my mom on the phone, before realizing how long she had been dead.

The apartment started falling apart around me. I'd patch things just enough to keep them functional, but I stopped caring about making the place livable. The walls were stained, the carpet was torn, everything smelled like despair and stale air.

By year eight, I was barely human anymore. I'd go days without speaking out loud, weeks without looking in a mirror. I forgot what my own voice sounded like. I forgot what it felt like to touch another person, to breathe fresh air, to feel sunlight on my skin.

When Mr. Blackwood finally returned, he walked through my front door as if he already had the key. I was sitting in the same spot I had been for the past three days, staring at a TV that had been broken for months, reciting lines from How I Met Your Mother.

""Congratulations, Mr. Walker."" He handed me a check. One hundred million dollars. ""You did it.""

I took the check with shaking hands. My fingernails were long and yellow. I probably smelled like death.

""So,"" I said, my voice hoarse from disuse. ""What's next? A billion for twenty years?"" There was a tone in my voice that hinted at sarcasm, but part of me truly wanted an excuse to just lie here for a little bit longer.

Mr. Blackwood laughed, a genuine sound of amusement.

""Oh no, Mr. Walker. You've earned this. You've given us everything we needed. You're free to go.""

Free to go. Sixteen years later, I was free to go.

I walked outside for the first time in over a decade and immediately collapsed. The sunlight was too bright, the air too fresh, the sounds of traffic and people too overwhelming. I sat on the sidewalk and vomited until there was nothing left before passing out.

I came too in a pool of my own waste, barely coherent but aware enough to get my bearings. After all this time inside, I wasn’t sure where to go. The streets looked unfamiliar after years of construction and local tax dollars. But there was one place I was sure would still be open.

I went to Murphy's.

Jimmy wasn't there anymore – he'd retired years ago. The new bartender didn't know my order, didn't know to leave me alone. Everything was different.

I'm sitting here with my beer, surrounded by people half my age. Every time I try to join in, the words feel foreign in my mouth. Desperate for any kind of connection, I offered to buy drinks for strangers, thinking maybe my newfound wealth could at least purchase some temporary companionship. But each time I tried to pay for someone else, my card was declined. Within minutes, my phone would buzz with a text from an unknown number:

Total: 317  
LDL: 240  
HDL: 77  
Ratio: 4.1

10 years ago my total number was around 6.5 but I didn't investigate it much at the time. Now it is obviously much too high.  
  
I am 35 years old, very athletic. Body fat was 11% per a dexa scan a few years ago and hasnt changed much since.   
I lift weights 3x a week, do zone 2 cardio cycling 3x a week for 45mins and do 1x intense cycling workout per week. I also walk my dog daily, surf a few times a week.

So essentially I cant improve much on the exercise front. 

Dietary is definitely an area to look into.  
I spent 10 years doing the whole butter coffee thing (20g butter), fasting till lunch etc.  
Have been off that for about 6 months now.  
  
Current diet would look like the following:  
  
Breakfast: 3 eggs, spinach and 2 slices sourdough with **generous** butter. Coffee with 170ml whole milk.

Lunch: 100g rice, can tuna/salmon, cucumber, tomato, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, olives.

Snack: avocado shake with whole avo + 250ml whole Milk + whey protein + tbsp almond butter + handful blueberries

or 

3tbps whole greek yoghurt + tbsp peanut butter + whey + handful nuts + blueberries

Dinner: Steak/Chicken/Fish w/ broccoli, green beans, asparagus, zucchini, potato etc. Usually choose 2 veggies out of those.

Naughty Vice: Chocolate - I will generally do this 4 or 5 times a week and I worked out id be having about 50g in added sugar by binging. I know this is the low hanging fruit so to speak and will be cutting out instantly. 

Other than cutting the chocolate out I will swap the butter to olive oil, reduce the milk in my coffee to 100mL, swap the snack to either lite milk/yoghurt or just make an avocado smash type thing without milk. Probably won't change much else yet, just want to see if these changes will do much - but open to advice.

Will be retesting in 2 months to see if I can improve my situation.

Campers who decide to turn up on the night of June 11 will find Cabin 43's gothic exterior garden lit up with [purple string lights](https://imgur.com/a/2txjzrN). The violet glow dimly illuminates the path to the front door, which stands open with warm candlelight and cozy music spilling out. Inside, the birthday girl is putting the finishing touches on her decor with the help of Phoebe (who has first dibs on cupcakes in exchange for her help).

[Phae](https://imgur.com/a/VUmFx68) is almost done lighting the dozens of candles arranged around the common room, some burning with multicolor flames so that odd shadows rimmed with blended colors decorate the walls and floor. Blankets, plush pillows, and some board games Phae found in the cupboard are strewn all about. Cupcakes and lemonade can be found on the coffee table, which has been pushed up against the wall from its usual place.

The center of the room is, of course, reserved for ghosts. Phae figures a proper seance would be overkill at a place as ghost-ridden as Camp Half-Blood, so she decides clearing a circle for them to occupy if they're interested is more than enough. They can intermingle outside the circle if they wish, of course, but [witchy candle circles](https://imgur.com/a/VKoJ3Tw) are an integral part of the aesthetic she's trying to cultivate here. In further service of the aesthetic, Phae will perform tarot readings for those who want over the course of the evening. Guests are encouraged to come and go as they please, but Phae encourages them to be around at midnight.

Congratulations,"" Dr. Ray said with a gentle smile, ""you're pregnant.","# Scene-by-Scene Breakdown, Real Talk Review, and Where You Can Read It Now

After knowing the truth, he regretted deeply...

Congratulations,"" Dr. Ray said with a gentle smile, ""you're pregnant.""

I blinked rapidly, trying to focus. Her smile never wavered as she guided my attention to the screen, pointing to two tiny dots pulsing in sync.

“Twins,” she added. “You’re having twins.”

Twins? I couldn't even grasp the reality of being pregnant. I had been so careful—so cautious. The pills Kyle had insisted I take every single day were supposed to prevent this. We had a contract—one that explicitly forbade a pregnancy. That was the deal, after all.

“I… I’ve been taking the pills,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. My hands shook, and I placed them on the edge of the examination table, trying to steady myself.

Dr. Ray glanced at me with a slight frown. “Are you sure you've been consistent?”

I hesitated, unsure. My memory was hazy. There had been moments when I had been distracted. “I…” My voice cracked, and I shook my head. “I’m not sure.”

Dr. Ray’s looked at me with concern. “Don’t you want your baby?”

“No,” I murmured. “I didn’t think I could get pregnant.”

She helped me wipe the cool gel from my stomach. ""Well, what matters now is ensuring your health and the babies' health. I must warn you though,"" her expression grew serious, ""your uterus condition requires extra attention. You'll need proper nutrition, regular rest, and frequent check-ups.""

I nodded mechanically, my hand drifting to my still-flat stomach. Two lives. Two tiny beings growing inside me. Kyle's children. Our children.

My hands gripped the steering wheel as I tried to breathe. The drive home was a blur. I kept thinking about the contract's words.

Clause 6 - Regular contraception required.

No pregnancies permitted. The terms of our marriage were clear, clinical, like everything else about our relationship. I should not get myself pregnant as my entire life was built on pretending to be his wife while the world—and he—saw me only as a secretary.

I pulled into our driveway, staying in the car. Marriage was supposed to be about love, trust, and building a life together. But when your husband saw it as merely a business arrangement, those dreams become nothing more than wishful thinking. Kyle had made that crystal clear from the beginning.

""This is a deal,"" he'd said, sliding the contract across his mahogany desk. ""I hope you don't have any other ideas."" But I did have other ideas. I had love - years of it, carefully hidden love. So I'd signed, clinging to the hope that maybe, just maybe, time would help him see me differently.

Three years later, that hope had proven as substantial as morning mist. Our relationship existed primarily in the darkness of our bedroom, mechanical and devoid of emotion. During daylight hours, I was just another employee at K.T. Enterprises, our marriage a secret known only to Linda, his personal assistant.

When I arrived home, I moved mechanically, my hands trembling as I prepared a quick meal. Maybe it was just my nerves, but I felt hungrier than usual. I allowed myself to eat more, knowing I needed to maintain my strength.

After eating, I took a shower quickly. Standing in front of the mirror, I stared at my reflection. My body hadn't changed yet—not visibly, anyway. My stomach was still flat, no sign of the growing life inside me. But the reality of it was there, and the idea of two little beings growing inside me made my heart race. Would they look like me? Would they have my green eyes? Or would they inherit their father's dark, stormy gaze?

I couldn’t help but wonder about them. What this pregnancy would mean for our future? Would they bring hope? Or just more disappointment?

When I finished getting dressed, I settled on the couch, waiting for Kyle to return. I wasn’t sure how long I had been sitting there. My mind raced, playing out every possible scenario in which I would break the news to him. The evening stretched endlessly. My hand kept returning to my stomach, trying to forge a connection with the tiny lives within. But Kyle was late today. The minutes dragged on, stretching into hours until I finally started to doze off.

I awoke to familiar hands on my skin, and my heart rate immediately spiked.

When I wake up, I'm already in bed, and Kyle has already taken off my clothes. “Kyle, you're home,” I feel nervous, and my lower abdomen twitches slightly.

""You missed work today,"" he murmured against my neck, his breath warm. His lips brushed, a quick, possessive gesture, before he bit me lightly. I gasped, my body tensed.“You didn't go to work today.”

“I didn't feel well, so Linda and I took the day off.”

Kyle's tongue slipped into my mouth. I realized what he was going to do, but not today. I turned my face away. ""Kyle,"" I looked up at his handsome face. He had the kind of cheekbones a sculptor would create, and his jawline would never stop. His eyes were the most amazing shade of grey, and at the moment they were full of lust.

""Open your legs,"" he said. His hard part was already against my entrance.

""No, Kyle. Not today.” He stopped.

He pulled back, his grey eyes darkening. ""Why?""

""My stomach's upset,"" I said, the partial truth bitter on my tongue.

The warmth in his expression frosted over instantly. He stood, wrapping his robe around himself as he headed for the bathroom. ""Make sure you see John about it,"" he called over his shoulder. John was our personal physician. I would never go to him for a pregnancy test. I bit my lip.

""Kyle, there's something I want to tell you."" I began, but my words were drowned out by the sound of running water.

I sat up slowly, deciding to wait for him to finish his shower. That's when his phone lit up on the nightstand. A message notification caught my eye. Despite myself, I looked.

The name made my blood run cold: Taylor.

""I miss you, babe. Come see me on Thursday.""

I was familiar with the name. Everyone who worked at K.T. was probably familiar with it. Kyle Branson had built the most legendary company in ten years. This seemingly cold and rational man named his business after him and the woman he loved the most. Their initials as K.T. Enterprises. A constant reminder of the woman he truly loved, emblazoned across every building, every document, every paycheck.

I may know Taylor a little better than others because she is my younger stepsister.

Then his phone rang again, calling from Taylor.

Kyle walked out of the bathroom. I quickly turned away from his phone, my heart pounding. He picked up the device and left the bedroom without a word to me. The door clicked shut behind him.

I pulled my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. Even through the closed door, I could hear the low murmur of his voice. He always spoke to her in that gentle tone. That is a tone I'd never heard him use with me.

I pressed my face against my knees, trying to hold back my tears. My hand moved unconsciously to my stomach. What would Taylor say if she knew I was carrying Kyle's babies? My stepsister had already taken so much from me. My father, my home, my inheritance - and now she wanted Kyle back.

The memories came flooding back, making me feel sick. I was fifteen when my mother died. Cancer took her quickly, leaving me alone with my father. I thought he would be there for me. I was wrong.

A week after Mom's funeral, he brought home his new wife and her daughter Taylor. That's when my whole world fell apart. That's when I learned the painful truth. Dad had been seeing them behind Mom's back for years. He'd only married my mother for her money. Taylor's mother had been his true love all along.

I got up from the bed, needing to move. The bedroom suddenly felt small and suffocating. I walked to the window, pressing my forehead against the cool glass. Outside, the city lights twinkled like nothing was wrong.

The sound of Kyle's voice grew louder as he walked past the bedroom door. ""Thursday works perfectly. I'll make reservations at your favorite restaurant.""

My fingers curled against the glass. Thursday. He was planning a date with her while I stood here carrying his children. Children he didn't want. Children that violated our contract.

I remembered the day Taylor first came to our house. She was thirteen, two years younger than me, but she acted like she owned the place. Maybe she did. Within days, my father had moved all of Mom's things to the attic. Within weeks, he'd redecorated the entire house to Taylor's mother's taste. It was like Mom had never existed.

""You're just like your mother,"" Taylor would say to me at school, her voice dripping with contempt. ""Always in the way. Always trying to hold onto things that don't belong to you.""

The bathroom door opened, and Kyle walked back in. I quickly wiped my eyes, but I couldn't hide how pale I was. My reflection in the window showed a ghost of a woman.

""You look sick,"" Kyle said, his voice cool and detached. So different from how he'd spoken to Taylor moments ago. ""Go see a doctor tomorrow.""

I turned to face him, wrapping my arms around myself. ""Would you speak to Taylor like this?"" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Kyle's expression hardened. ""You shouldn't mention that name. And don't compare yourself to her.""

His words hit me like a physical blow. Of course. How could I forget? I was just the backup plan. The convenient wife who stayed in the shadows while he pursued his true love.

""You're right,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""I'm not worthy. I'm just the girl you married because your board of directors insisted you needed a stable image. I'm just your secretary who pretends to be your wife.""

Kyle's jaw tightened. "" We had an agreement, Mia. You knew what this was from the start. Don't try to make it something it's not.""

I laughed, but it sounded more like a sob. ""A contract. That's all our marriage is to you, isn't it? Just another business deal.

""Yes,"" he said coldly. ""That's exactly what it is. Make sure you stick to that.""

My hand instinctively moved to my stomach before I caught myself. But Kyle had already turned away, heading for the door. ""I have an early meeting tomorrow. Don't wait up.""

The door closed behind him with a final click. I sank onto the bed, my legs no longer able to hold me up. The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled over.

How had I ended up here? When did I become this pathetic woman who accepted crumbs of attention from a man who loved someone else? Someone who happened to be the same person who had made my teenage years a total misery?

I remembered the first time I saw Kyle. It was at a high school party - one I wasn't supposed to be at. Taylor had made sure I knew I wasn't welcome, but I went anyway. Kyle was there with his friends, tall and handsome in his football jersey. He only had eyes for Taylor.

Everyone knew they were the perfect couple. Kyle Branson, the star quarterback from the wealthy family. Taylor Matthews, the beautiful cheerleader with the perfect life. And me? I was just the awkward stepsister who didn't belong anywhere.

But I fell for him anyway. Quietly, hopelessly, I fell in love with Kyle. Even after high school, when I got the job as his secretary at K.T. Enterprises, my feelings didn't change. If anything, they grew stronger.

Then came the scandal. Kyle's reputation was at risk, and the board insisted he needed to clean up his image. He needed a wife - someone quiet, someone who wouldn't cause problems. Someone who would sign a contract and stay in the shadows.

I was the perfect candidate. The quiet secretary who already knew how to be invisible. The girl who loved him enough to accept any terms, just to be near him.

Now here I was, three years later, carrying his twins while he planned dates with my stepsister.

I got up and walked to my purse, pulling out the ultrasound picture. In the darkness of the room, I could barely make out the two tiny dots that would change everything. My babies. Our babies. Even if Kyle never loved me, even if this pregnancy violated our contract, I couldn't give them up.

Tomorrow, I would have to go back to work. I would have to sit at my desk and pretend everything was normal. I would have to watch Kyle and Taylor together, knowing I carried his children under my heart.

As I lay in bed, one hand resting protectively over my stomach, I made a decision. I wouldn't tell Kyle about the pregnancy. Not yet. Not until I figured out what to do. These babies were mine. They are the only real thing in this fake marriage. And I would protect them, no matter what it cost me.

The sound of Kyle's car starting in the driveway made me flinch. He was leaving, probably heading to his penthouse apartment downtown. The one where he stayed when he didn't want to play house with his contract wife.

I curled up tighter under the blankets, trying to find warmth in the empty bed.

Tomorrow would be another day of being the invisible wife. But tonight, in the darkness of our bedroom, I allowed myself to cry for everything I might lose when the truth finally came out.

Chapter 3 Make Waves

Mia's POV

The morning sickness hit me as soon as I woke up. I barely made it to the bathroom in time. Dark circles under my eyes. Pale skin. I had to look better than this. I couldn't let anyone at work suspect anything.

Linda was waiting for me when I arrived at the office. ""Are you feeling better?""

""Yes, much better."" I forced a smile. Linda watched me carefully, but didn't push.

Linda’s expression as neutral as ever, holding out two cups of coffee. “He asked for these,” she murmured, her tone professional, yet I could sense a hint of pity in her eyes.

My stomach churned at the thought of coffee, but I nodded. ""Sure.""

I balanced the two cups carefully. Two cups. My heart sank. I already knew who the second one was for.

When I pushed open Kyle's office door, Taylor was perched on the edge of his desk. She wore a tight red dress that probably cost more than my monthly salary. Her perfectly manicured hand rested on Kyle's shoulder.

""Oh, look who it is,"" Taylor's voice dripped honey. ""How nice to see you, Mia.""

I set the cups down carefully, trying not to let my hands shake. ""Your coffee, Mr. Branson.""

""That's not how I like my coffee,"" Taylor pouted. She picked up the cup and took a sip. ""Too much sugar. Be a dear and get me another one.""

I clenched my fists. ""I didn't make the coffee, Miss Matthews. Perhaps you should specify your preferences to the coffee shop directly.""

Taylor's eyes narrowed for a moment before she laughed. ""Oh, Kyle, isn't she adorable? So defensive over a cup of coffee."" She turned to me, her smile never reaching her eyes. ""You know, Mia, attitude like that is probably why you're still just a secretary.""

Kyle didn't even look up from his computer. ""That will be all, Mia.""

I turned to leave, but Taylor wasn't done. ""Actually, Mia, wait."" She stood up, smoothing her dress. ""Could you show me to the ladies' room? This building is so big, I always get lost.""

I knew it was a trap. But with Kyle sitting right there, I couldn't refuse. ""Of course.""

The moment we entered the bathroom, Taylor's sweet facade dropped. She checked every stall before turning to me, her eyes cold.

""I know what you're doing,"" she hissed. ""Playing the perfect employee, always so helpful, so eager to please. Everyone knows you’ve always been desperate for any scrap of attention. You’re just like your mother—always looking for something that isn’t yours""

My hands trembled. ""Don't talk about my mother.""

""Why not? Everyone knew what she was - a gold-digger who trapped my father with her money. And now look at you, following in her footsteps.""

""That's not true."" My voice shook. ""My mother loved Dad. She didn't know—""

""She didn't know he was already in love with my mom?"" Taylor laughed. ""Please. She knew exactly what she was doing. Just like you know exactly what you're doing with Kyle.""

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Taylor stepped closer. ""Don't play innocent. I've seen how you look at him. How you've always looked at him. It's pathetic, really. Do you think he'll ever see you as anything more than what you are? A convenient employee he can use?""

""Stop it."" My stomach churned. Whether from morning sickness or stress, I wasn't sure.

""You know what's funny?"" Taylor continued. ""Kyle tells me everything. About his little arrangement. About how the board forced him to find a wife quickly after that scandal. And guess who was there, so eager to sign whatever contract he put in front of her?""

I felt the blood drain from my face. Kyle had told her about our marriage?

""Oh, don't worry,"" Taylor smirked. ""Your secret is safe with me. It's too amusing to spoil. Kyle's fake wife, pining away while he spends his nights with me.""

""You're lying."" But my voice sounded weak even to my own ears.

""Am I? Where do you think he goes when he's not at your little love nest? Who do you think he's with?"" She pulled out her phone, scrolling through photos. ""Look. Last night, after he left you. And the night before that.""

The photos showed Kyle and Taylor at various restaurants, clubs, looking intimate. Happy. Real.

""Stop."" My voice cracked.

""You'll never be anything to him, Mia. I have told you, you're just like your mother, trying to hold onto things that don't belong to you. But you should remember what your mom got. ""

Something in me snapped. I couldn't take it anymore.

The slap echoed in the tiled bathroom. Anger flared inside me, and before I could think, my hand flew up, landing a hard slap across her face. The sharp sound echoed in the empty hallway.

Taylor's head snapped to the side. For a moment, there was absolute silence. Then she started to smile.

""Oh, Mia,"" she said softly. ""You shouldn't have done that.""

She grabbed her own arm and squeezed hard, leaving red marks. Then she messed up her hair slightly and let tears fill her eyes.

The bathroom door burst open. Kyle stood there, his face dark with anger.

""Kyle!"" Taylor sobbed, running to him. ""I don't know what happened! I was just trying to be friendly, and she attacked me!""

""She's lying!"" I said. ""Kyle, she—""

""I saw enough,"" Kyle cut me off. His voice was ice cold. ""Taylor, are you alright?""

She buried her face in his chest, her shoulders shaking with perfectly timed sobs. ""I just wanted to talk to her. To try and be friends. I know our past is complicated, but...""

Kyle wrapped his arms around her protectively. The sight made me feel sick.

""Please,"" I whispered. ""Kyle, let me explain.""

Taylor touched her cheek, her expression shifting instantly to one of hurt innocence. “Kyle, I… I didn’t mean to upset her,” she said, her voice soft, pleading. “Please, don’t be angry with her.”

Kyle’s gaze was cold as he looked at me. “Apologize, Mia,” he ordered, his tone hard.

I met his gaze, refusing to back down, my heart breaking anew. “No,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I won’t apologize.”

Kyle’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought I saw something in his eyes—disappointment, maybe, or frustration. But it vanished as quickly as it appeared.

“Fine,” he said coldly. “You’re suspended. I’ll let Linda handle your work until further notice.”

The words were a knife in my heart, but I lifted my chin, refusing to let him see how much they hurt. “Understood.”

I walked away without another word, my heart aching, feeling like I had left a piece of myself behind.

Chapter 4 A New Job

Mia's POV

I sat in the dark living room, watching the hours tick by. The house felt emptier than usual. Kyle hadn't come home since the incident at the office three days ago. I knew he was punishing me, but I still waited.

The clock struck midnight. Then one. Then two. No Kyle.

My phone buzzed, startling me. A message from an old college friend lit up my screen.

""Hey stranger! Long time no see. Coffee tomorrow?""

Jeo Parker. I hadn't heard from him in ages. Back in college, we'd spent countless hours together in the art studio. He'd always believed in my talent, even when I didn't.

I hesitated before replying. A coffee wouldn't hurt, would it?

""Sure. Where?""

The next morning, I found myself at a quiet café downtown. Jeo was already there, his familiar smile warming the room. He stood when he saw me, and I was struck by how well time had treated him. His dark hair was stylishly messy, his blue eyes as kind as I remembered.

""Mia Williams,"" he said, pulling me into a gentle hug. ""Still as beautiful as ever.""

I blushed, unused to such open affection. ""You look good too, Jeo.""

""I ordered you hot chocolate instead of coffee,"" he said as we sat down. ""You never could stomach coffee in the morning.""

The simple fact that he remembered made my throat tight. When was the last time someone had noticed such a small detail about me?

""So,"" he began, ""I heard you're working at K.T. Enterprises?""

I nodded, stirring my hot chocolate. ""In HR.""

""Really?"" His eyebrows rose. ""The girl who painted that incredible mural in the university hall ended up in HR?""

""Things change,"" I said softly.

""They don't have to."" He leaned forward. ""That's actually why I wanted to meet. My design firm just landed a huge project. We're looking for fresh talent, and I immediately thought of you.""

""Me?""

""Don't act surprised, Mia. You were always the most talented girl . Remember that scholarship you turned down?""

I did remember. It had been right after Kyle hired me as his secretary. I'd convinced myself that being close to him was more important than pursuing my dreams.

""I don't know, Jeo. It's been years since I've drawn anything.""

""Just come see the studio,"" he pleaded. ""No pressure. Just look around.""

His enthusiasm was infectious. For the first time in days, I felt myself smiling. ""Maybe I could—""

""Mia.""

That voice. My smile froze.

Kyle stood at our table, his expression unreadable. He wore a crisp black suit. He looked perfect, untouchable.

""Mr. Branson,"" I said automatically, my voice small.

Jeo stood, extending his hand. ""Kyle Branson? I'm Jeo Parker. I went to college with Mia.""

Kyle ignored his hand. His eyes were fixed on me. ""A word, Mia.""

It wasn't a request. I stood shakily, avoiding Jeo's concerned look.

""Mia,"" Jeo called after me. ""Think about what I said, okay?""

Kyle's jaw tightened. He led me outside, his hand on my elbow. His touch burned through my sleeve.

""Who is he?"" Kyle's voice was low, dangerous.

""Just an old friend.""

""Friends don't look at each other that way.""

I pulled my arm away. ""What way? The way you look at Taylor?""

His eyes flashed. ""That's different.""

""How? How is it different, Kyle?""

""Because you signed a contract."" He stepped closer, crowding me against the wall. ""You agreed to certain terms. No relationships with other men during our marriage.""

I laughed bitterly. ""Our marriage? Is that what you call this arrangement?""

""It's still legally binding."" His breath fanned across my face. ""Or have you forgotten?""

""No,"" I whispered. ""I haven't forgotten anything. Including where you've been the past three days.""

Something flickered in his eyes. Guilt? Anger? I couldn't tell anymore.

""What I do is none of your concern.""

""But what I do is your concern?"" I challenged. ""That's not fair, Kyle.""

""Life isn't fair."" He straightened his tie. ""Remember our agreement, Mia. Don't make me remind you again.""

He turned to leave, then paused. ""And tell your friend to stop wasting his time. You're not available.""

""He's offering me a job,"" I said to his back.

Kyle stopped. Turned slowly. ""What?""

""A job. At his design firm."" I lifted my chin. ""I used to paint, before...""

""Before what?""

""Before I became your secretary."" The words tasted bitter. ""Before I signed your contract.""

Kyle's expression darkened. ""You're not considering it.""

""Why not? You've suspended me anyway.""

""Temporarily."" He stepped closer again. ""You're my wife, Mia.""

""Your wife?"" I met his gaze. ""Because it seems like I'm only your wife when it's convenient for you. When you need to show the board how stable you are. When you need someone to warm your bed.""

His hands clenched into fists. ""That's not true.""

""Then where were you these past three days, Kyle? With Taylor?""

Kyle grabbed my wrist, not hard enough to hurt, but firm. ""You knew what this was from the beginning. Don't act like I deceived you.""

""No,"" I whispered. ""I deceived myself. I thought maybe... maybe if I was patient enough, kind enough, if I followed all your rules..."" I snatched my wrist. ""But I was wrong, wasn't I?""

Something flickered in his eyes. ""Mia...""

""You don't get to control every aspect of my life, Kyle. Not anymore.""

""The contract—""

""The contract says I can't have relationships with other men. It doesn't say anything about taking a job."" I straightened my spine. ""Unless you're jealous?""

His laugh was harsh. ""Jealous? Of him? Don't be ridiculous.""

""Then there's no problem, is there?""

We stood there, staring at each other. For a moment, I thought I saw something in his eyes. But then his mask slipped back into place.

""Fine,"" he said coldly. ""Take the job. But remember your place, Mia. You're still my wife.""

""No, Kyle. I'm your employee who happens to have signed a marriage contract. There's a difference.""

""We'll discuss this at home,"" he said finally. Without another word, he turned and walked away. This time, I let him go.

My phone buzzed with a message from Jeo.

""Are you okay? Want to finish our conversation about the job?""

I stared at the message for a long time. And I typed back: ""Tell me more about the position.""

Chapter 5 Unwanted Feelings

Kyle's POV

I couldn't focus on work. The image of Mia with that man kept playing in my mind. Jeo Parker. Even his name irritated me.

""Linda,"" I called through the intercom. ""Get me everything you can find on Jeo Parker.""

""The designer?"" Linda's voice was carefully neutral. ""Right away, sir.""

I loosened my tie. The office felt too hot. What would Mia be doing at his design firm? Would she be alone with him? Would they work late together? Artists do that sort of thing, don't they?

The thought of them in his studio made my jaw clench. Would he teach her how to hold a brush? Would his hands touch hers? Would they work on portraits? Would she pose for him?

I yanked my tie completely off. The images wouldn't stop. Mia smiling at him the way she used to smile at me. Mia staying late at his studio. Mia letting him get too close.

""Stop it,"" I muttered, pouring myself a drink. This was purely professional concern. Nothing more. Mia was my wife. On paper, at least. I had a right to know about her work environment.

Linda knocked and entered with a thick file. ""Jeo Parker's background, sir.""

I flipped through it, my frown deepening with each page. Award-winning independent designer. Guest lecturer at prestigious art schools. His work had been featured in major galleries across Europe. Forbes' 30 Under 30. Private commissions from celebrities and royalty.

Something uncomfortable settled in my stomach. ""Find out more about his personal life.""

Linda hesitated. ""Sir?""

""Is he married? Dating anyone?""

""I'll check."" She paused. ""There's something else you should know.""

I looked up.

""Miss Williams was an art major in college. She had a full scholarship offer to Paris.""

I stared at her. ""What?""

""She turned it down when you hired her as your secretary."" Linda's voice was careful. ""Her professors said she was exceptionally talented.""

The uncomfortable feeling in my stomach grew. Why hadn't I known this? Had I ever asked Mia about her interests? Her dreams?

""Should I look into acquiring his company?"" I asked abruptly.

Linda gave me a long look. ""Is that really what this is about, sir?""

""Get our lawyers to—""

""Mr. Branson,"" Linda interrupted, something she rarely did. ""Maybe you should talk to your wife instead of trying to do something to her colleague's company.""

I dismissed her with a wave. My phone buzzed. Taylor. I ignored it.

Taylor. She used to mean everything to me. Now... now her calls felt like interruptions. When had that changed?

I drove home early, something I never did. The house was quiet when I entered. Mia was in the living room, sketching something in a notebook. She looked up, surprised to see me.

""You're home early.""

I walked over, studying her face. She looked tired. Pale. Was she working too hard? Was she sick? Or was she just excited about her new job with him?

Without thinking, I pulled her up from the couch. She felt small in my arms, familiar. Right. I lowered my head to kiss her.

She turned away suddenly, her hand flying to her mouth. Before I could react, she ran to the bathroom. I heard her retching.

""Mia?"" I followed her, concern overriding my annoyance. ""Are you sick?""

She emerged pale, wiping her mouth. ""I'm fine.""

""You don't look fine."" I reached for her, but she stepped back.

""I won't be your backup plan anymore, Kyle."" Her voice was tired. ""I won't share you with Taylor.""

""This isn't about Taylor."" The thought of Taylor felt distant, unimportant.

""Then what is it about?"" Her green eyes challenged me. ""Why are you really here?""

Because I can't stand the thought of you working with him. Because the idea of another man making you smile makes me want to destroy something. Because— ""Because you're my wife.""

""Your contract wife,"" she corrected bitterly.

I noticed her reaching for something in the bathroom cabinet. A pill bottle. ""What are those?""

""Nothing."" She tried to hide them, but I caught a glimpse of the label.

""You've been taking a lot of pills lately.""

""They're just vitamins."" She clutched the bottle tightly.

""For your new job?"" I couldn't keep the sarcasm from my voice.

""Yes, actually. I need to be healthy."" She tried to move past me.

I blocked her path. ""Tell me about this job.""

""Why? So you can try to stop me from taking it?""

""I want to know what you'll be doing.""

She laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. ""Now you're interested in what I do? After three years of treating me like your convenient bedroom arrangement?""

Her words stung more than they should have. ""That's not fair.""

""No? When's my birthday, Kyle? What's my favorite color? What did I study in college?"" Her voice cracked. ""You don't know anything about me because you never cared to ask.""

""I know enough.""

""You know what's in our contract. That's all."" She pushed past me. ""I need to get ready for bed.""

""We're not done talking about this job.""

She spun around. ""Yes, we are. You made your choice a long time ago, Kyle. You chose Taylor. Now I'm making my choice.""

""This isn't about Taylor,"" I repeated, my voice hard.

""Then why did you spend the last three days with her?""

Because I was angry. Because I needed to prove I didn't care what you did. Because being with her felt wrong now, and I don't understand why. ""That's none of your business.""

""Exactly."" She smiled sadly. ""Just like my new job is none of yours.""

I watched her walk away, feeling strangely helpless. When had everything become so complicated? This was supposed to be a simple arrangement. A marriage of convenience. Nothing more.

So why did the thought of her working with Jeo Parker make me want to destroy everything he'd built?

My phone buzzed again. Taylor.

For the first time, I didn't want to answer. Instead, I found myself walking to my study, opening my laptop. I typed in the name of the pills I'd seen Mia taking.

Something wasn't right. She was hiding something. And I was going to find out what.

But first, I had another call to make. ""Linda? Find out everything you can about art studios. Working hours. Common practices."" I paused. ""And get me Jeo Parker's complete schedule.""

I had a feeling I wouldn't be sleeping much tonight. The thought of Mia in his studio, spending hours alone with him... No. I wouldn't let that happen.

She was my wife. Contract or not, she belonged with me.

Chapter 6 His Nonchalance

Mia's POV

Linda entered. ""Mrs. Branson called. She wants both of you home for dinner tonight.""

My mother-in-law was the only person who treated our marriage as real, who saw me as more than Kyle's convenient arrangement.

Kyle's jaw tightened. ""Tell her we're busy.""

""I already tried, sir,"" Linda replied, ""She insisted. Said, and I quote, 'Tell my stubborn son that if he doesn't bring my lovely daughter-in-law home for dinner tonight, I'll come to his office myself.'""

""Fine. We'll go."" Kyle said.

The drive to the Branson mansion was silent. I watched the familiar neighborhoods pass by, each getting progressively more exclusive until we reached the tree-lined street where Kyle had grown up. The mansion stood proud and elegant, its windows warmly lit against the darkening sky.

Catherine was waiting at the door, her silver hair perfectly styled, her emerald dress matching her eyes.

""Finally!"" She exclaimed, ""My darlings!""

She embraced me first, holding me tight. Her familiar Chanel No. 5 perfume wrapped around me like a comfort blanket. ""Mia, sweetheart,"" she pulled back, studying my face with motherly concern. ""You look pale. Has my workaholic son been keeping you up too late at the office?""

""Mother,"" Kyle's voice held a warning tone.

""Oh, hush,"" Catherine waved him off, pulling me toward the house. ""Come in, come in. Mrs. Reynolds has outdone herself with dinner tonight.""

The mansion's interior hadn't changed since the last time we visited. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow over the antique furniture and family portraits. Everything spoke of old money, tastefully displayed yet comfortable. Catherine had always managed that delicate balance.

Catherine smiled as the first course was served. A delicate mushroom soup that filled the room with an earthy aroma. ""Though I do miss the days when this table was fuller. Remember the Sunday dinners we used to have, Kyle? All your cousins would come...""

""That was a long time ago, Mother,"" Kyle replied.

Catherine sighed, stirring her soup. ""Everything changes, doesn't it? Eva next door just became a grandmother last month. Her daughter had twins."" She looked up at us, her eyes twinkling. ""Speaking of which, when can I expect grandchildren?""

Kyle's fork clattered against his plate. ""Mother—""

""Don't 'mother' me,"" Catherine cut him off. ""You've been married three years. Three years! Do you know how many of my friends are already grandmothers twice over?""

""Work keeps us busy,"" Kyle said.

""Work!"" Catherine's voice dripped. ""Always work with you, Kyle. A woman needs more than a busy husband to be happy. She needs to be loved.""

The word 'loved' hung in the air like a physical presence.

""The company is going through an important phase,"" Kyle said stiffly. ""We can discuss children later.""

Catherine's eyes narrowed. ""That's an excuse and you know it. When I was pregnant with you—""

""Mother, we've discussed this,"" Kyle cut in, his voice sharp. ""My priority right now is expanding the company into international markets. Children would be... inconvenient.""

Inconvenient. The word hit me like a physical blow. My stomach churned violently as the smell of the food suddenly became overwhelming. Black spots danced at the edges of my vision as waves of nausea washed over me.

""May I be excused?"" I interrupted, ""I need some air.""

Catherine's expression softened immediately. ""Of course, dear. Use the garden. The night blooming jasmine is beautiful this time of year.""

I wandered through Catherine's immaculate garden, past perfectly trimmed hedges and blooming flowers, until I reached the stone bench by the fountain.

My hand drifted to my stomach. Inconvenient, Kyle had called the idea of children. What would he say when he discovered these babies?

I closed my eyes, remembering all the times I'd sat in this very spot, dreaming of a future where Kyle would look at me the way he looked at Taylor. Where our marriage would be more than just a contract. Now here I sat, carrying his children, while he still saw me as nothing more than a business arrangement. The irony was almost too much to bear.

""I thought I'd find you here.""

I turned to see Catherine approaching, a cashmere shawl in her hands. She draped it around my shoulders before sitting beside me.

""You always loved this spot,"" she said softly. ""I remember the first time Kyle brought you home. You spent hours here, sketching the flowers.""

""I'm sorry, dear,"" Catherine continued, taking my hand in hers. ""I know my son. I failed him in some ways. After his father died..."" she paused, her voice catching. ""Kyle threw himself into being perfect. Perfect grades, perfect businessman. He forgot how to feel.""

""Catherine, I—""

""Let me finish."" Her grip on my hand tightened. ""You're good for him, Mia. Better than he deserves. I see how you look at him, how much you love him. ""

""Mother."" Kyle's voice cut through the darkness. ""Stop meddling.""

Catherine stood, turning to face her son. ""Take care of your wife, son. Before it's too late.""

The city lights blurred past us as Kyle drove, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. I gathered my courage, trying to find the right words.

""Kyle,"" I said softly, ""what you said at dinner, about children being inconvenient...""

""What about it?"" His voice was cold. ""Family is not my thing. You knew this when you signed the contract.""

My heart sank. Sure. I shouldn't get this idea in my head. I shifted in my seat, trying to find a more comfortable position, when something rolled against my foot.

Reaching down, my fingers touched smooth metal. I picked it up. A lipstick tube – Dior Rouge, the exact shade I'd seen on Taylor's lips countless times at the office. The gold case gleamed mockingly in my palm, and I could smell her signature perfume lingering on it.

Of course. She'd been in his car. Recently. This wasn't some accident. Taylor never left anything to chance. She'd placed it here deliberately, another cruel reminder that she was the one Kyle truly wanted.

""Pull over,"" I whispered, fighting back bile.

""What?""

""Pull over!"" The words came out more forcefully than I intended. ""I need air.""

Kyle's jaw clenched as he pulled to the curb. Without a word, I got out, wrapping my arms around myself in the cool night air. The car engine revved once before he drove away, leaving me alone on the sidewalk.

The city lights blurred as tears filled my eyes. How had my life become this? My head spun, whether from pregnancy or emotion, I couldn't tell.

""Mia?""

Through my tears, I saw a familiar face. Jeo stood there, concern etched across his features. Without hesitation, he shrugged off his leather jacket, draping it over my shoulders.

""You're freezing,"" he said, his hand warm on my arm. ""What are you doing out here alone?""

""I'm fine,"" I tried to say, but the words slurred. The ground seemed to be moving beneath my feet.

""You're not fine."" Jeo's voice grew urgent as I swayed. ""You need a hospital.""

""No, I just need—"" My knees buckled.

""Hospital,"" Jeo decided, catching me before I hit the ground. ""Now.""

like sunlight at 8 a.m.—  
unasked for,  
but welcome all the same.

You laughed with your whole body,  
left books in odd places,  
and drank your tea too hot.

You stayed.  
And then—  
you didn’t.

No sharp ending,  
just the slow forgetting of love shared,  
of inside jokes—  
and who first broke the silence.

Now,  
your name rings softer in my chest.  
The ache doesn’t echo like it used to.  
Even my dreams have learned  
not to look for you every night.

The longing, once loud,  
grows quieter  
in the presence of someone  
who used to stay  
but now only visits in memory.

You show up  
in the smell of morning coffee,  
in the second verse of a song I forgot we knew,  
in sideways glances at strangers  
who almost carry your shape.

In my heart,  
you visit,  
but never stay.

And still, you soften the silence.  
Still, you pull the ache from its shelf  
and leave it humming low,  
the way old houses remember  
who used to live in them.

1l9cblg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l9cblg/my_experience_with_research_drugs/,My experience with research drugs,"When i was 18 me and my mate J were buying pot from the local dealer. He offered us new drug that was in a piece of paper. He said it was super acid and J who was into psychedelics bought us both two hits. They looked like little 1 cm squares of paper. 

We went behind the train station by a river and ate the paper and smoked for around an hour before we started walking down the river waiting for the drugs to kick in. I don't remember much of an effect until this man with a red ball cap came out of the bushes and asked what we were doing. His face looked extremely exaggerated and angular and I felt like he was threatening me. I thought i turned around and ran but then i was standing there with J while he was talking to the guy. I started to freak out because it felt like everything I was doing I was only doing in my head. 

J said the guy told us to leave and said we need to run. I thought the guy was threatening us and J said he was a cop so we ran up into a neighborhood. We were walking down the street and I remember it felt like everyone was looking at me and staring into my soul. I thought I was seeing the evil inside of everyone and it was terrifying. Out of the corner of my eye I could see my shadow and I thought it was moving differently than I was walking. There was this street light that had three lights on it and I thought the lights had faces and were angry at me. 

We went to J's house after and we were going to play gta 5. When we got into his room he said he needed to take a shower and disappeared into his bathroom. I was sitting in his room trying to figure out his Xbox but it was foreign alien technology basically. I tried turning it on by taking it off the shelf and sitting on it and that was logical to me at the time. With that didn't work I put a pillow on top of it and it still didn't turn on. I could not even remember my name or what life was like before I took the drug. 

He ended up coming out of the shower like 3 hours later I forgot I was waiting in his room. He put on sausage party, that stupid movie with the hot dogs and it was just terrifying to me. I couldn't watch it. I turned around and looked at the wall the whole movie because the faces on the characters looked evil. 

When the sun rose I walked home still awake. I stopped to get some bagels and coffee but when I walked in the store it was so bright and the cashier's face was terrifying so I left the store and realized I was so hungry so I went back in and the cashier looked at me weird. I ordered a cream cheese bagel and thought I ordered a coffee but I got a bagel and orange juice but I left because I couldn't remember if I ordered that or not. 

When I got home I couldn't find my keys and thought I left them at J's they were not in my pockets. I ended up getting in by climbing the second floor balcony with my juice and bagel in one hand only to discover the keys in my front hoodie once I got inside. After eating I spent the entire day cleaning my apartment. When I eventually got to sleep I had been awake almost 48 hours and ended up sleeping for 18 hours.

I’m had to work up the courage just to message you a few weeks ago. Scrolling down your profile, I was so captivated by your beautiful bright eyes. Your skin is spectacular, so smooth and silky. Your dark hair is absolutely stunning, I’d like to run my fingers through every strand, then lightly massage the back of your neck. I finally did it, I messaged you and had to let you know that I think you are super super cute. 

I was taken in by your eyes and that gorgeous smile, and I adore the poetry that you write, and your expansive taste in music. I would like to hear all about you. Perhaps we can grab a coffee and go for a stroll on the beach and get to know each other, let’s see if there’s sparks. I was overcome with such a wide smile when you replied that you are very attracted to me, and that you like what I have to say and that you want to get to know me as well. A rush of butterflies and rainbows filled my vision. I have a plethora of inspiration and I’m working on my goals and dreams. 

You had mentioned that you are working on yourself and that you’re in therapy, that you want to heal a bit more before we meet in person for our first potential date. I really respect your honesty and as a matter of fact I am in therapy as well and want to continue to heal on my path and be the best version of myself. I’m here to listen to you when you need someone to talk to. I am here to support you! N, we both want to love again and I shall be here when you are ready. I am sending you boat loads of hope, as I am filled with so much hope and inspiration. 

I have acquired patience in my life finally, since I’ve been living alone, single these past 3 years. I will wait no matter how long it takes. I do not want to force anything. I want us to build a friendship without any pressure at all or timeline. Babe, you are so worth it! I want to be there for you and be the one who puts a smile on your face. I’m here for you and will be shedding trauma, acquiring trust and living life one day at a time. I will send you some of my favorite songs every now and then, and ask how you’re doing and feeling. I care about you and know that you are so worth it. I’d be more than happy to give you anything you need and more. I will give and  give more. If you require space, I will give you space. I shall listen to everything you say, and want to hear all about your favorite hobbies. I will wait for you.

1l9cb6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l9cb6p/someone_offered_me_1_million_to_stay_inside_for_a/,Someone Offered Me $1 Million to Stay Inside for a Year. I Should Have Said No.,"This all started about 16 years ago when Rachel left me. Not that I blame her – I was a mess back then. Hell, I'm still a mess now, just a different kind of mess. We'd been together for four years, and I thought we were going to get married. I had the ring and everything. But apparently, my opinions on ""taking things slow"" and her opinions on ""building a future together"" were two very different things.

After she moved out, I pretty much became a hermit. I work as a freelance developer, mostly building AI algorithms for tech companies, so I was already working from home most days. It was easy to just... stop leaving. I'd order groceries online, get everything delivered, and spend my days coding and my nights drinking cheap beer while scrolling through Netflix.

The only place I'd go was Murphy's, this little dive bar around the corner from my apartment. Even then, it was just to sit alone, nurse a couple of Budweisers, and pretend I was being social. The bartender, Jimmy, knew my order and knew not to bother me with small talk. It was perfect.

My mom would call every few days, asking when she could come visit or when I was coming home for dinner. My friends would text about hanging out, grabbing drinks, going to concerts. I ignored most of it. It was easier to just stay in my bubble and feel sorry for myself. Rachel had moved on – I could see her Instagram posts of her new life, new boyfriend, new everything. Meanwhile, I was wearing the same sweatpants for three days straight and eating cereal for dinner.

That's when he showed up.

It was a Tuesday in March, around 2 PM. I remember because I was in the middle of debugging some neural network code when the doorbell rang. I almost didn't answer it – I wasn't expecting any deliveries, and I definitely wasn't in the mood for Jehovah's Witnesses or solar panel salesmen.

But something made me get up and look through the peephole.

He was tall, maybe in his fifties, wearing an expensive-looking gray suit that probably cost more than my rent. Perfectly groomed silver hair, the kind of confident smile that made you trust him immediately. He looked like he belonged in a boardroom, not standing outside my shitty apartment building.

I opened the door, probably looking like I'd been living in a cave for months, which wasn't far from the truth.

""Mr. Walker?"" His voice was smooth, professional.

""Yeah, that's me. Can I help you?""

""I certainly hope so. My name is Mr. Blackwood, and I have a proposition that might interest you."" He glanced past me into my apartment, taking in the empty beer bottles, the clothes draped over furniture, the general disaster that was my life. ""May I come in?""

Everything in my brain was screaming that this was wrong, but there was something about his presence that made me step aside and let him in. He sat down on my couch like he owned the place, completely unfazed by the mess.

""Mr. Walker, I'll get straight to the point. I represent certain... interested parties who are conducting a social experiment. We're looking for individuals who might be willing to participate in an extended isolation study.""

""Isolation study?""

""Quite simple, really. You would agree to remain inside your residence for exactly one year. No leaving, not even to step outside for fresh air. No exceptions whatsoever. In exchange, you would receive one million dollars upon successful completion.""

I stared at him for a long moment, waiting for the punchline.

""You're serious...""

""Completely. You can continue working, use the internet, order anything you need for delivery. The only requirement is that you cannot physically leave this apartment for 365 consecutive days.""

A million dollars. I made decent money coding, but a million dollars would change everything. I could pay off my student loans, my credit cards, maybe even buy a house. And honestly, the way I'd been living for the past few months, I was basically already doing it for free.

""What's the catch?""

Mr. Blackwood smiled. ""No catch. Simply a year of your life in exchange for financial freedom. We'll provide you with a direct deposit of $50,000 upfront to cover any expenses, and the remaining $950,000 upon completion.""

He pulled out a contract from his briefcase. It was surprisingly short – just two pages of legal language that basically said I couldn't leave my apartment for a year, and if I did, I'd forfeit the money and have to pay back the advance.

I should have asked more questions. I should have wondered who these ""interested parties"" were, or why they'd pay someone a million dollars to stay home. But I was depressed, broke, and honestly? The idea of having an excuse to avoid the world for a while sounded perfect.

I signed the contract.

To be honest, the first few months were actually amazing. The $50,000 hit my account before I had even woken up the next day, and suddenly I could afford good food, better beer, all the video games and streaming services I wanted. I threw myself into work with a new enthusiasm, taking on bigger projects and making more money than I'd ever made before.

My friends thought I was crazy when I told them about the deal, but most of them were also kind of jealous. ""Dude, you're getting paid a million dollars to do what you were already doing,"" my buddy Marcus said during one of our video calls. ""That's the easiest money ever.""

Even my mom was supportive, though she worried about my mental health. ""Just promise me you'll call if you need anything, honey. And maybe try to eat some vegetables once in a while.""

I started talking to myself around month four, but it didn't feel weird. Just little comments while I was coding, or narrating what I was doing while cooking. ""Alright, let's see if this algorithm actually works this time."" Normal stuff. Everyone talks to themselves sometimes, right?

The hardest part was the loneliness that would hit at random moments. I'd be having a great day, crushing some coding project, and then I'd see a photo on social media of my friends hanging out without me, and it would feel like a punch to the gut. But I had video calls, texting, social media. I wasn't completely cut off from the world.

When the year was up, Mr. Blackwood returned exactly as promised. He handed me a check for $950,000 with that same professional smile.

""Congratulations, Mr. Walker. I trust the experience wasn't too difficult?""

""Actually, it was easier than I expected.""

""Excellent. In that case, I have another proposition for you.""

My heart started racing. I'd been dreading this moment ending, going back to the real world, figuring out what to do with my life.

""Five more years, Mr. Walker. Same rules, same apartment. In exchange, ten million dollars.""

Ten million dollars. Fuck. That was retire-early, never-work-again money. That was buy-a-house-in-cash, travel-the-world money. And honestly, I'd gotten pretty comfortable with my setup. Five years would fly by.

I signed the second contract without hesitation...

The first year of the five-year deal went smoothly. I was making great money with my coding work, I'd settled into a routine, and I was actually happier than I'd been since Rachel left. I'd lost some weight, started working out in my apartment, even tried meditation. My friends joked that isolation was the best thing that ever happened to me.

But then things started going wrong.

It was during year two that Rachel called. I saw her name on my phone and almost didn't answer, but curiosity got the better of me.

""Hey, David."" Her voice was exactly the same, and it hit me like a freight train.

""Rachel… Hi. I wasn’t expecting to hear from you.""

""I know this is random, but I've been thinking about you lately. About us. I was wondering if maybe we could get lunch sometime? Just to talk, you know? I think I... I ***we*** both made some mistakes.""

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. This was what I'd been hoping for, dreaming about, for years. She wanted to try again. But...

""I... I can't.""

""You can't? Are you... seeing someone?""

""No, it's not that. I just... I literally can't leave my apartment right now. It's complicated.""

There was a long silence.

""David, what the hell are you talking about? Are you under house arrest or something?""

I tried to explain about the deal, the money, how I only had three more years left. But even as I said it, I could hear how insane it sounded.

A few deafeningly quiet moments passed before she finally responded, ""You’re still exactly the same, aren’t you? Choosing money over us? Over the chance to fix what we had?""

""It's not that simple, Rachel. It's ten million dollars. Think about what we could do with that kind of money. We could—""

""I can't believe you right now. I thought maybe you'd changed, but you're still just a weak little man-child who refuses to take responsibility for anything.""

She hung up. I called back seventeen times. She never answered.

That night, I sat in my apartment and cried for the first time since she'd left. But I didn't break the contract. Three more years, I told myself. Three more years and I'd have enough money to win her back, to prove that I could provide for her, for us.

In year three, my mom called with news that made all of my veins freeze.

""Honey, I need to tell you something. I went to the doctor last week for my annual checkup… and they found a lump in my breast. They're doing more tests, but they think it might…"" her voice faded into an orchestra of muffled chaos as her words sunk in.

The world stopped. My mom was only fifty-eight. She was supposed to have decades left. She was supposed to meet my future kids, see me get married, grow old gracefully.

“Do you think that nice gentleman would understand, and let you come home for a while, sweetie?” her voice cracked.

I paused for a moment. My breath became short as I weighed the options. 10 million dollars is so much to abandon, especially if the tests were to come back benign… but it’s my mom. I could feel the tears welling up in my cheeks, moving toward my eyes. I must have been silent for a little too long as I decided, because she felt the need to interject.

“No, it’s fine. Forget I asked at all. I’m sorry, honey. I shouldn’t have put you through that kind of stress. You’ve been working really hard, and who knows – with that kind of money, you’d be able to afford any treatment, even from God himself!” She tried to laugh.

She made me promise not to break the contract. Against every instinct in my body, I stayed in my apartment.

The cancer was aggressive. Stage three by the time they caught it. I watched my mom fight through video calls, seeing her get thinner and weaker with each round of chemo. I sent her money for the best treatments, the most expensive doctors, but it wasn't enough.

My friends stopped calling as much. Marcus got married in year four – I watched the wedding through a livestream he set up for me. ""It's not the same without you here, man,"" he said during our call afterwards. ""Sarah asks about you all the time. She thinks you've lost your mind.""

Maybe I had. I was talking to myself constantly now, having full conversations with imaginary people. I'd argue with my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I'd narrate my entire day out loud just to hear a human voice, even if it was my own.

""Okay, David, time to make some coffee. Ethiopian beans today, because we're feeling fancy. Aren't we feeling fancy? Yes, we are definitely feeling fancy.""

I started leaving the TV on 24/7 just to have background noise, familiar voices. I knew every episode of The Office by heart. I could recite entire scenes from Friends. These fictional people became more real to me than my actual friends and family.

My mom died on a Tuesday in February. Year five, day 364. One day before my contract was up.

I got the call from my aunt Linda at 6:47 AM. ""She fought so hard, David. Right up until the end, she kept talking about how proud she was of you, how excited she was to see you when you finished your project.""

I hung up the phone and screamed until my throat was raw. I put my fist through the bathroom mirror. I threw my laptop across the room and watched it shatter against the wall.

But I didn't leave. I couldn't leave. Not with one day left. Not when I was so close.

Mr. Blackwood showed up exactly twenty-four hours later, at 6:47 AM. He handed me a check for ten million dollars.

""My condolences on your recent loss, Mr. Walker.""

Of course he knew.

I was about to tell him to go fuck himself when he smiled and continued.

""I have one final proposition for you. Ten more years. Same arrangement. But this time, we'll make it worth your while. One hundred million dollars.""

One hundred million dollars. Now that was some real ""fuck you money"". Enough money to buy anything, go anywhere, do whatever I wanted. Enough money to make sure my mom's death wasn't for nothing. Enough money to win Rachel back, to show her what I'd accomplished.

""Why?"" I asked. ""Why me? Why any of this?""

""Because you're very, very good at it, Mr. Walker. Most people break by year two. You've made it five years and you're still... functional.""

I looked around my apartment. My self-prescribed tomb. My prison. My home.

""Ten years?""

""Ten years.""

I signed the third contract.

The next decade was a blur of darkness. I stopped working – what was the point? With the upfront deposits and previous checks, I had enough money to last multiple lifetimes. I stopped showering regularly, stopped cleaning, stopped caring about anything. I'd sleep for sixteen hours a day and spend the other eight staring at screens, watching other people live their lives.

Rachel got married. I saw the photos on Facebook before I finally deleted all my social media accounts. She looked happy. Radiant. Everything I could have given her, if I hadn't been so fucking greedy.

Marcus and Sarah had three kids. I watched them grow up through Christmas cards and sporadic texts that eventually stopped coming altogether. They stopped asking when I'd be done with my ""project."" They stopped asking about me at all.

I started seeing things that weren't there. Shadows moving in my peripheral vision. Voices calling my name from the hallway outside my door. Sometimes I'd spend hours talking with my mom on the phone, before realizing how long she had been dead.

The apartment started falling apart around me. I'd patch things just enough to keep them functional, but I stopped caring about making the place livable. The walls were stained, the carpet was torn, everything smelled like despair and stale air.

By year eight, I was barely human anymore. I'd go days without speaking out loud, weeks without looking in a mirror. I forgot what my own voice sounded like. I forgot what it felt like to touch another person, to breathe fresh air, to feel sunlight on my skin.

When Mr. Blackwood finally returned, he walked through my front door as if he already had the key. I was sitting in the same spot I had been for the past three days, staring at a TV that had been broken for months, reciting lines from How I Met Your Mother.

""Congratulations, Mr. Walker."" He handed me a check. One hundred million dollars. ""You did it.""

I took the check with shaking hands. My fingernails were long and yellow. I probably smelled like death.

""So,"" I said, my voice hoarse from disuse. ""What's next? A billion for twenty years?"" There was a tone in my voice that hinted at sarcasm, but part of me truly wanted an excuse to just lie here for a little bit longer.

Mr. Blackwood laughed, a genuine sound of amusement.

""Oh no, Mr. Walker. You've earned this. You've given us everything we needed. You're free to go.""

Free to go. Sixteen years later, I was free to go.

I walked outside for the first time in over a decade and immediately collapsed. The sunlight was too bright, the air too fresh, the sounds of traffic and people too overwhelming. I sat on the sidewalk and vomited until there was nothing left before passing out.

I came too in a pool of my own waste, barely coherent but aware enough to get my bearings. After all this time inside, I wasn’t sure where to go. The streets looked unfamiliar after years of construction and local tax dollars. But there was one place I was sure would still be open.

I went to Murphy's.

Jimmy wasn't there anymore – he'd retired years ago. The new bartender didn't know my order, didn't know to leave me alone. Everything was different.

I'm sitting here with my beer, surrounded by people half my age. Every time I try to join in, the words feel foreign in my mouth. Desperate for any kind of connection, I offer to buy drinks for strangers, thinking maybe my newfound wealth can at least purchase some temporary companionship. But each time I try to pay for someone else, my card is declined. Within minutes, my phone buzzes with a text from an unknown number:

I (32F) have been helping them open it (opening the end of June) set up door dash, menus, renovation, making employee handbooks, hiring people, etc. All of the months I spent with them working in the shop 5-6 days a week for months went unpaid for. Occasionally they would buy me and my son breakfast or lunch.

My son is 4. She expects me to work in a dangerous environment (bakery/coffee shop) with him somehow. When I voice my concerns about how it’s dangerous, she tells me “lots of kids grow up in businesses. Get over it. He’s lucky” I’m like what? Are you ok? 

I quit a few months ago bc they are gonna pay non family employees normal wages & under pay me because I’m family. When I spoke up about it, my mom said all I care about is money. She threw everything she did for me in my childhood & said how dare I. She apologized later on & asked me to come back & I said ok because I felt guilty. 

I quit for the 2nd (& final) time last weekend when my brother (30M) flew home (we are in NJ) from Texas for 1 week to help. This is his 1 week of help to my months of help. I told them (mom, dad, bro) I wasn’t coming in this last weekend because I had plans with my husband & son. They were mad. My brother decides to text me 22 times & call 5 about a window sign when I was driving with my husband & son. I blue toothed that I would call back when I could. He then said “it’s funny how I can text but not call” I didn’t feel like explaining that I talk to text so I said “who are u talking to like that?” He then told me to “shut the fuck up” & I’m a “nobody”

My breaking point is he texted me back “shut the fuck up” (this is all in the group chat w our parents btw) We aren’t close & I would just never say that to anyone let alone him. I just said I would call when I could.  

My quitting point was when my mom privately texted me that I was the rude one for saying “who are you talking to like that” & that it was ok my brother said STFU as a response back to me. She said I was a pos & she will replace me. I didn’t answer. She said she will never forgive me & will never speak to me again because they are supposed to be opening Friday & if it fails, it’s my fault. I never asked them for this business to be opened. It’s not even mine. I was just helping because it was the right thing to do. Ugh. ",3,1749698623.0,AmItheAsshole,9,1.0,False

About a year and a half ago, my father passed away, as a result of that I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, but for the last month or so, I have started to notice certain things that I either didn't notice before or didn't give them importance. 
First, certain things irritate me, they cause me a kind of rage, usually it passes quickly, in a matter of seconds (for example, people singing near me, or loud noises that happen quickly, blows with hammers or people moving tables), but there are other things when this rage lasts longer, for example, interrupting my immediate plans: taking money from my wallet - > going to buy a coffee - > going to my room and watching a movie, when any of these activities are interrupted, I get a great rage, which does not pass until several minutes later.
another thing that happens to me is with sounds that increase gradually in a fast way, for example a truck approaching on the road,this generate me fear, a panic that is proportional to the increase of the sound, then it goes away.
Now comes the main reason why I am writing here, lately I am having more frequent discussions with my mom because when I am talking to her or in her company and I feel that she suddenly changes her mood or gets frustrated, it makes me uncomfortable in a way that makes me complain, it's almost automatic, and I end up feeling bad.
When all these things happen, I end up having the need to move my hands, fingers, or sometimes repeat a sound several times, something like a ""mmmmmmmmmm"", or what I do the most, walk around inside the house while listening to music and start an internal dialogue (although I don't think it's a dialogue, because I don't hear any voice, I sound more like a speaker, I talk about a topic while specific parts of that explanation I gave of the topic appear in my head and I start talking about it, I don't know if I explained myself well, but it's the best I can do to describe it, it's as if from a topic I'm branching out, usually I'm not explaining it to anyone specific, but sometimes I do as an ""interviewer"" myself, this happens especially when I start thinking about a fictional universe I've created, and I start explaining to myself the characters' abilities, the world or the story line), also while doing this I turn my hair curls, I like to feel the hair redden in my fingers.
There are other less relevant things :
Food must be in a specific ratio, something like 70-30, if this is not fulfilled I can still eat but it generates a bit of rejection (in my country they eat a lot of rice, rice would be 70% and the other 30 what goes with the rice ).
I usually walk on my toes, but when I was younger this was much more frequent, now I only do it when I walk fast
About social things : Lately I am also feeling that I am lazy to relate to people (I am an introvert INFP) because I feel that the ""autopilot"" was deactivated and I have to put a conscious effort
(I'm 18 yo but I don't know if that's important) 
It should be noted that before writing here I have done some research and that is why I have been able to explain better some things like stimming, but I am very interested in knowing other experiences similar to mine.",1,1749698610.0,AskAutism,0,0.99,False

1l9c787,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l9c787/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_101_family_legacy/,Rebirth Protocol - Bk1 Ch. 10.1 - Family Legacy,"Nick moved through the evening shadows with practiced caution, the weight of Maggie's backpack a constant reminder of the stakes involved. His dorm was compromised—surveillance devices in the ceiling vent and almost certainly elsewhere. Jordan remained an unpredictable variable, potentially reporting Nick's movements to unknown handlers. The campus itself had become a carefully monitored battlefield, with cameras tracking his movements and ""maintenance workers"" installing new surveillance equipment.

His dorm building loomed ahead, windows illuminated against the gathering dusk. Nick scanned the perimeter as he approached, his enhanced perception detecting subtle electromagnetic signatures from cameras positioned at strategic points. A maintenance van that hadn't been there that morning caught his attention—the same vehicle he'd spotted outside Engineering Building C earlier. Concrete evidence that the surveillance operation had expanded.

Nick took the stairs instead of the elevator, pausing at each landing to listen for any unusual activity. With each floor, he extended his senses outward, mana flowing to his ears and eyes in controlled bursts that heightened his awareness without the visible manifestation of blue energy. The technique was becoming more natural with each attempt—like flexing a muscle that had always existed but remained dormant until now.

The hallway to his room appeared empty, but his enhanced senses detected a faint electronic signature emanating from somewhere near Jordan's room—a rhythmic pulse that suggested active communication rather than passive recording. Someone was transmitting data in real time.

He unlocked his door with deliberate calm, pushing it open with practiced nonchalance. The room appeared untouched, but Nick's enhanced perception immediately detected a change—a subtle electronic hum that hadn't been there before, concentrated above his desk. A quick glance confirmed his suspicion: a new device disguised as a motion sensor, its lens barely visible unless you knew exactly where to look.

*They're escalating their monitoring. Interesting.*

The device's electromagnetic signature pulsed against his mana-enhanced senses, its pattern revealing sophisticated technology far beyond standard university security. Whoever had installed it wasn't merely watching—they were analyzing, collecting data on his every movement with scientific precision.

Nick moved naturally around the room, gathering his textbook and notebook as if he hadn't noticed the new addition. As he was about to leave, he paused, hearing muffled voices from across the hall. Jordan's room.

""—pushing too hard,"" Jordan was saying, his voice tense. ""He's already suspicious.""

A second voice responded—older, authoritative. ""Your concerns are noted, but irrelevant. The Director wants closer monitoring. The subject's behavior patterns have deviated significantly from baseline predictions.""

""That's exactly my point,"" Jordan argued. ""Aggressive surveillance will only accelerate the deviations. We should—""

""You were assigned to observe and report, not to develop strategy,"" the second voice cut in coldly. ""Your previous failure to maintain proper surveillance protocols has already been noted in your file.""

A heavy silence followed, the tension almost palpable through the wall.

""Yes, sir,"" Jordan finally responded, all protest gone from his voice.

""The Coleman application is of particular interest. If he receives the fellowship, he'll have access to restricted research facilities. That cannot happen.""

Nick's brow tightened. He hadn't thought much about the fellowship since submitting the proposal last week—it had been a strategic move without immediate payoff. But apparently, it had attracted more attention than he expected. The fellowship wasn't just an academic opportunity—it potentially offered access to facilities connected to his investigation. And whoever was running this operation was growing concerned about his ""deviations from baseline.""

*Good. Let them worry.*

The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in response to his satisfaction, a silent confirmation of his growing advantage. Nick slipped quietly out of his room, filing away this new information as he headed toward his Business class.

Professor Williams' business classroom was already half-full when Nick arrived. The space smelled of coffee and whiteboard markers, overlaid with the distinct cologne favored by business majors trying too hard to appear professional. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead at a frequency most students couldn't consciously detect, but to Nick's enhanced hearing, it created a distinct background tone that set his teeth on edge.

He chose a seat that offered good sightlines to both entrances while positioning himself away from Sarah's usual spot. He had no interest in another pointless verbal sparring match.

As if summoned by his thoughts, Matt appeared in the doorway, scanning the room until his gaze locked on Nick. Unlike their previous encounters, there was no attempt at casual friendliness. Matt's face was tight with strain, dark circles under his eyes suggesting sleepless nights. A nervous energy radiated from him—visible to normal perception but almost painfully obvious to Nick's mana-enhanced senses.

Matt started toward Nick but stopped when his phone buzzed. Checking the screen, his expression shifted from annoyance to something closer to fear. His aura—the subtle electromagnetic field that surrounded all living things but was visible only to Nick's enhanced perception—flickered with jagged patterns of stress and anxiety.

Instead of approaching Nick, Matt took a seat on the opposite side of the room, immediately tapping out a response on his phone. His hands shook visibly—another telling detail.

*Matt Harrington, golden boy with the perfect future laid out before him, was unraveling, but why? And what did it all have to do with him?*

Sarah entered moments later, her calculated poise intact as she surveyed the room. When she spotted Nick, her eyes narrowed slightly, but she made no move to approach him. Instead, she slid into the seat beside Matt, placing a hand on his arm in what appeared to be a calming gesture. Matt jerked away from her touch with unexpected violence, knocking her hand aside.

""Don't,"" he hissed, loud enough for several nearby students to turn and stare.

Sarah's mask of composure cracked for a split second, genuine hurt flashing across her features before the cold calculation returned. ""You need to pull yourself together,"" she whispered, though Nick's enhanced hearing caught every word. ""They're asking questions about your reliability.""

""Because you've been telling them I'm losing it,"" Matt shot back, his voice low but intense. ""Your reports. Your assessments. Don't think I don't know.""

""That's not—""

Matt slammed his notebook shut, the sound sharp in the sudden silence.

""Save it,"" he snapped, knuckles white as he gripped his pen. He stood abruptly, backpack half-zipped, and stalked off to another seat just as Professor Williams strode in.

The interaction told Nick more than any confrontation could have. The alliance between Matt and Sarah was fracturing under external pressure. Whoever they reported to was demanding results that weren't forthcoming, and Matt clearly suspected Sarah of undermining him to save herself.

*Bureaucratic infighting,* Nick thought, the memory of Arlize's experiences with court intrigue surfacing. *A classic pattern—when missions fail, blame shifts like quicksand.*

Professor Williams clapped his hands, his energetic presence drawing all attention forward. The professor's aura blazed with genuine enthusiasm, a stark contrast to the calculating energies that surrounded Matt and Sarah.

""Good afternoon, future captains of industry!"" he announced. ""Today we're discussing corporate intelligence—the ethical boundaries of information gathering in competitive markets.""

Nick almost laughed at the timing. The irony was too perfect, considering his current situation.

The lecture proceeded with Williams' usual dynamism, covering frameworks for evaluating the ethics of various intelligence-gathering methods. Nick participated strategically, offering insights that demonstrated knowledge without revealing too much about his own situation.

When Williams divided the class into pairs for a case study, Nick found himself partnered with a quiet economics major named David rather than Sarah—a small mercy that allowed him to focus on the task rather than verbal fencing.

As class ended, Nick gathered his materials efficiently, planning to exit before either Matt or Sarah could intercept him. He was almost to the door when Professor Williams called out.

""Mr. Valiente, a moment of your time?""

Nick approached the lectern as other students filed out. Through the doorway, he noticed Matt lingering, clearly hoping to overhear whatever Williams wanted to discuss.

""Your Coleman Fellowship application has generated quite a bit of interest,"" Williams said, his voice pitched low enough to remain private. ""Dean Harrison was particularly impressed with your research proposal on predictive modeling for sustainable technologies.""

""I'm glad to hear that,"" Nick replied. ""It's an area I believe has significant potential.""

Williams glanced briefly toward the door, where Matt was still pretending to organize his backpack. ""I should mention that the selection committee has... expanded this year. There's been considerable corporate interest in our student research initiatives.""

The slight emphasis on ""corporate"" caught Nick's attention. ""I understand. Is there anything specific I should address in my final application?""

Williams leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping further. ""Just be aware that your work will be scrutinized not just for academic merit, but for... commercial applications. Callahan Industries has taken a particular interest in sustainable technologies recently.""

""I appreciate the heads-up,"" Nick replied, reading between the lines. Williams seemed to be warning him, albeit subtly, that his application had attracted attention from Callahan Industries specifically.

As Nick left the classroom, he spotted Matt already on his phone, undoubtedly reporting this latest development to whoever was pulling his strings. Sarah waited in the corridor beyond, her composed mask firmly in place. As Nick approached, she didn't move aside, forcing him to either stop or brush past her.

Nick chose neither, instead pausing just beyond arm's reach, his expression neutral. ""Something on your mind, Sarah?""

She glanced down the hallway toward Matt, who was pacing like a cornered animal, his free hand gesturing wildly as he spoke into his phone. When Sarah turned back to Nick, her eyes held a flicker of something he couldn't quite pin down—fatigue? Calculation? Perhaps even fear? Then her expression shuttered, the cold condescension he'd known for years back in place.

""The Coleman Fellowship,"" she said without preamble, her voice pitched for his ears alone. ""Williams doesn't recommend freshmen. Especially not ones with your... previous academic record.""

Nick maintained his neutral expression. ""Perhaps he sees potential where others don't.""

""Or perhaps there's more to your sudden academic brilliance than meets the eye."" Her gaze traveled over his face with clinical precision. ""That application could open doors to restricted research areas. Interesting timing for someone who's suddenly so... focused.""

Sarah leaned slightly closer, her perfume—jasmine with undertones of vanilla—a calculated sensory trigger she'd always used around him. ""Let's stop pretending. You know something, don't you? About Callahan Industries. About Matt's family.""

Now this was interesting. Not Sarah warning him about Matt, but Sarah fishing for information—trying to determine exactly what Nick knew and how he'd changed so dramatically.

""I know lots of things, Sarah. What specifically interests you?"" Nick countered, watching her reaction carefully.

A flash of frustration crossed her features before the mask returned. ""Things are changing quickly. Alliances are shifting. The people Matt and I report to are... reevaluating positions."" She paused meaningfully. ""Including yours.""

""And why tell me this?"" Nick asked, his voice neutral despite the significance of what she was revealing.

""Because whatever information you have, whatever you've discovered—it's valuable."" Her eyes flickered to Matt again before returning to Nick. ""Valuable enough that I might be interested in a different arrangement than the one I currently have.""

Now the picture became clearer. Sarah wasn't warning Nick out of concern—she was positioning herself to potentially switch sides if Nick had something better to offer than her current handlers.

""Sounds like someone hedging their bets,"" Nick observed.

""I prefer to think of it as recognizing changing circumstances."" Sarah's smile was thin but calculated. ""When the board shifts, the smart players adjust their strategy.""

""And Matt isn't adjusting?""

""Matt is loyal to his family connections. I'm loyal to my own."" Sarah stepped back slightly. ""Think about it, Nick. My family and I can be powerful allies or dangerous enemies. And right now, you seem to be someone worth aligning with.""

Without waiting for his response, Sarah turned and walked away, her posture perfect, her pace unhurried. The message couldn't be clearer: she wasn't warning Nick about Matt—she was offering herself as a potential defector if Nick's position proved stronger than her current alliance.

As Nick watched her retreating figure, he recognized the dangerous game she was playing. Sarah wasn't concerned about Matt's stability; she and those backing her were concerned about backing the winning side. She'd sensed the shift in Nick's bearing, his newfound confidence and knowledge, and was probing to see if he might be worth betraying her current allies for.

*The most dangerous player is the one willing to change sides mid-game,* Nick thought, remembering how Arlize had been betrayed by allies seeking better positions. *Sarah's looking for the winning team, not loyalty or truth.*

And that made her more dangerous than ever—but potentially more valuable too.

The library's six-floor Modern Research Wing offered what Nick needed—a temporary secure location away from prying eyes and electronic surveillance. Unlike the older sections of the library, this wing featured private study pods with lockable doors, designed for collaborative work requiring privacy. Most importantly, the building's thick concrete walls created natural dead zones that interfered with electronic monitoring.

Nick reserved a pod on the fourth floor for two hours, selecting one that was situated in the building's corner, maximizing distance from security cameras in the main corridors. The pod was utilitarian—a small table with power outlets, four chairs, whiteboards on two walls, and a large monitor for presentations. The overhead light cast a sterile glow over everything, reflecting sharply off the glossy white surfaces.

Once inside, he locked the door and performed a careful sweep—no unusual electrical signals, no unexpected heat signatures, no tampering with the room's few fixtures. He activated the spectrum analyzer Maggie had provided, its steady green light confirming the absence of surveillance devices.

Only then did he open Maggie's backpack.

The laptop inside was military-grade—ruggedized case, encrypted boot sequence, no wireless capabilities. The machine's construction featured reinforced edges and what appeared to be specialized shielding against electronic interference. Nick powered it on using the password Maggie had provided in her text. The system booted to a stripped-down operating system with no unnecessary features.

But it wasn't the laptop that caught Nick's attention first—it was a sealed manila envelope marked with Maggie's precise handwriting: ""Project Rebirth – E. Zhang's Notes on Valiente Research.""

His heart quickened as he carefully opened the envelope. Inside were photocopies of handwritten research notes, equations, and diagrams that made little sense at first glance. But as Nick studied them, patterns began to emerge—references to ""bioenergetic amplification,"" ""conscious energy transference,"" and ""hereditary neural pathways.""

One page in particular stood out—a detailed analysis of what appeared to be brain scans labeled ""M.V."" and ""S.V."" His parents. Marco and Sierra Valiente.

The scans showed unusual activity patterns in regions typically dormant in normal subjects. Areas of the brain associated with spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, and energy regulation glowed with heightened activity, particularly in the thalamus and pineal gland. Around the edges of the scans, someone had sketched what looked like energy flow patterns—remarkably similar to the mana pathways Nick had observed during his meditation sessions.

Dr. Zhang had written below the scans:

""The Valientes' neurological patterns show extraordinary synchronization in regions typically dormant in human subjects. Their claims of 'family abilities' initially dismissed as metaphorical appear to have physiological basis. Their proposed research into bio-energetic potential activation could revolutionize our understanding of human consciousness—if Callahan would permit publication. Their insistence on hereditary transmission of these abilities warrants investigation, particularly regarding their son (N.V.).""

Nick stared at the notes, his hand trembling slightly. Blue energy pulsed beneath his skin in response to his emotional surge, creating faint patterns of light that danced across his fingers before he suppressed it with conscious effort. This was confirmation of what he'd begun to suspect—his parents had been studying mana scientifically, using their positions at Callahan to research their own hereditary abilities. And Dr. Zhang had known.

Further in the stack, Nick found a page of notes in his father's distinctive handwriting, dated just three weeks before the accident that claimed his parents' lives:

""S. believes we're being watched. Security protocols at the lab have tightened. Our access to the main Rebirth servers has been restricted. Whatever they uncovered in Colombian Subject 27's neural patterns has changed the project's direction. The similarities to our family's abilities are too precise to be coincidental. If our theories are correct about the inheritance patterns, Nicolas could be at risk. We've ensured his abilities remain dormant until he's old enough to understand and control them. The contingency measures are in place. If anything happens to us, my parents will know what to do when he turns 19.""

Nick felt a chill run through him. Colombian Subject 27. His parents' research. The ""dormant"" abilities they had somehow suppressed in him until his rebirth triggered their awakening. It was all connected—his family heritage, Callahan Industries, Project Rebirth, and the memories from Arlize that had somehow merged with his own consciousness.

Another page contained complex calculations and diagrams labeled ""Neural Pathway Synchronization Across Dimensional Boundaries."" The mathematical formulas described quantum entanglement between consciousness structures, with annotations suggesting that certain neural patterns could theoretically resonate across what Dr. Zhang called ""parallel possibility states.""

*Is this how it happened?* Nick wondered, a theory forming in his mind. *Did my connection to Arlize form through some kind of quantum entanglement between our neural patterns? Did my parents' suppression technique somehow create the conditions for this connection when it was finally released?*

Leaning back in his chair, Nick sighed, rubbing his eyes.

*This was too much to think about right now.*

Setting the documents aside for the moment, Nick inserted the drive containing his investment data, quickly transferring the encrypted files to the secure laptop. He then accessed his investment platform through the secure browser Maggie had installed.

What he saw made his pulse quicken even further.

Helios Pharmaceuticals had skyrocketed to $69.74 per share—an increase of over 3,100% from his entry price of $2.17. According to the financial news feed, the company had received unexpected fast-track approval for their breakthrough cancer treatment, triggering a buying frenzy that had been amplified by a short squeeze when several hedge funds were caught betting against the company.

His $2,500 investment was now worth nearly $80,500.

Nick studied the timeline carefully. This development wasn't just ahead of schedule—it had occurred months earlier than in his previous life. The catalyst had been an unexplained acceleration in the FDA approval process, pushed through by a congressional committee with oversight on pharmaceutical regulations.

The committee chairman's name caught Nick's eye: Senator James Callahan—Matthew Harrington Sr.'s brother-in-law.

Was this just coincidence, or was something more calculated at play? Could Callahan Industries have influenced the approval process to trigger this specific market movement? If so, why?

*They're testing me,* Nick realized with sudden clarity. *They're watching which stocks I invest in and manipulating the market to confirm whether I have foreknowledge.*

Nick hesitated only briefly before executing a partial sale—liquidating 80% of his position to lock in profits while maintaining some exposure to further upside. The proceeds would be more than enough for what he had in mind.

When he finished, Nick examined one more item from Maggie's backpack—a small device that resembled a simple USB flash drive.

A handwritten note explained:

""Spectrum analyzer. Detects surveillance equipment up to 50 feet in any direction. Green light means clean, yellow means possible electronic signature, red means active surveillance. Use it to find a truly secure location. —M""

Perfect. This would help him establish a safe haven away from Callahan's monitoring network.

1l9c32v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l9c32v/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_9_family_secrets/,Rebirth Protocol - Bk1 Ch. 9 - Family Secrets,"Dressing quickly, Nick headed toward Engineering Building C for his meeting with Maggie.

Engineering Building C stood apart from the main campus, its sleek glass and steel architecture a stark contrast to the red brick colonial style of most university buildings. The setting sun reflected off its windows in sheets of amber and gold, transforming ordinary glass into planes of molten light. Unlike the other campus buildings designed to evoke tradition and history, Engineering C was deliberately futuristic—built five years ago with funding from several technology corporations.

Nick paused at the entrance, studying the donor plaque with newfound interest. Callahan Industries featured prominently among the contributors, their logo sleek and minimalist beside several defense contractors and pharmaceutical companies. The building itself was a statement of corporate influence extending into academic space, boundaries blurring like the line between magic and technology in Nick's own body.

Security was tighter here than anywhere else on campus—Nick had to scan his student ID at the entrance and again at the elevator that would take him to the specialized labs on the third floor. The scanner hummed as it read his card, a thin blue light trailing across his ID photo. With his enhanced perception, Nick could detect subtle electromagnetic fields emanating from the security system—more sophisticated than standard university equipment, with encryption protocols that reminded him eerily of Arlize's magical wards.

*This isn't just keeping undergrads out of expensive labs,* Nick realized. *This is military-grade security disguised as campus protocol.*

The elevator hummed softly as it ascended, subtle vibrations traveling through Nick's feet. He used the moment of isolation to center himself, prepared for what might be a pivotal conversation. Maggie Zhang could either become his most valuable ally or a dangerous complication.

Lab C-314 was tucked at the end of a long corridor lined with research posters and glass-walled workspaces. The fluorescent lighting buzzed overhead with a frequency that Nick's enhanced hearing could now separate into distinct electronic pulses. He arrived precisely at 1:00 PM, knocking once on the frosted glass door.

It opened immediately, as if Maggie had been waiting just on the other side. She wore the same oversized hoodie as before, dark circles under her eyes suggesting she hadn't slept much since their last meeting. Her gaze darted past him, scanning the empty corridor before she grabbed his wrist and pulled him inside with surprising strength.

""You weren't followed?"" she demanded, securing three separate locks on the door with practiced efficiency. The distinct clicks echoed in the small space like miniature gunshots.

""Not that I detected,"" Nick replied, taking in the laboratory. It was smaller than he'd expected—more of a private workspace than a traditional laboratory. The air carried the sharp tang of solder and electronics, undercut by the familiar scent of energy drinks and instant noodles—the universal fuel of sleep-deprived researchers.

Multiple monitors lined one wall, displaying scrolling code and what appeared to be network traffic analysis. The screens cast a blue-white glow throughout the room, creating shifting patterns of light and shadow that reminded Nick of mana flows. A workbench dominated the center of the room, covered with circuit boards, soldering equipment, and partially disassembled devices Nick couldn't immediately identify. A discreet mini-fridge hummed in the corner, plastered with faded stickers from tech conferences and cybersecurity competitions.

Maggie gestured to a chair across from her workstation. ""Sit. No small talk. I've got a lot to show you, and we need to be efficient.""

She activated a small device on the table between them. It emitted a faint hum, accompanied by a subtle blue light that pulsed in a rhythm disconcertingly similar to the mana flowing beneath Nick's skin.

""White noise generator,"" she explained, noticing his gaze. ""Plus some electromagnetic countermeasures. Makes it harder for anyone to listen in."" Her fingers flew across her keyboard with practiced precision, bringing up a complex display of data streams and network maps. ""First things first,"" she said, turning to face him fully. ""The breach attempt on your files came from a secured address within the university network. Military-grade encryption, trying very hard to look like routine system maintenance.""

""Can you trace it?"" Nick asked, leaning forward to study the screen. The data visualization was intricate—a web of connections flowing like rivers between nodes of concentrated activity. If he unfocused his eyes slightly, the pattern resembled the mana pathways he'd observed during meditation.

""Already did."" A grim smile crossed her face, satisfaction lighting her eyes momentarily. ""It originated from the Office of Information Security, specifically a terminal registered to one Marcus Chen, Assistant Director of Cybersecurity.""

She pulled up an employee directory photo showing a middle-aged Asian man with wire-rimmed glasses and a serious expression.

""The university's own security team tried to hack my files?"" Nick's brow furrowed, a cold sensation settling in his stomach.

""Not exactly,"" Maggie said, her eyes gleaming with the satisfaction of a puzzle solved. ""The breach came from Chen's terminal, but I cross-referenced the timestamp. 1:17 AM. Chen was definitely at home with his family.""

""Someone used his credentials,"" Nick concluded, the implications sending a chill down his spine.

""And his access card."" Maggie brought up a building security log. ""But they made a mistake. The new biometric readers caught them—the fingerprint used to access the Information Security office doesn't match Chen's profile.""

She switched to another screen, displaying a partial fingerprint image highlighted with digital markers. ""University installed the new biometric readers last year. Most people don't realize they're being scanned every time they tap their ID.""

""Can you identify who the fingerprint came from?""

Maggie shook her head, frustration evident in the tightening of her jaw. ""Not directly. But I can tell you it matches a partial print from another system—the access panel for this very lab, three days ago."" Her eyes met his, intense and serious. ""Someone tried to get in here without authorization.""

""The same person who tried to access my files also wanted into your lab,"" Nick said slowly, the implications crystallizing. ""That can't be a coincidence.""

""So it would seem."" Maggie studied him with renewed intensity. ""Which raises the question: What's in your files that would interest someone with access to university security systems and military-grade hacking tools?""

The question hung between them, the hum of the white noise generator suddenly seeming louder in the silence. Nick chose his words carefully, weighing risk against necessity.

""Investment projections. Market analyses that... aren't common knowledge yet.""

""Bullshit,"" Maggie said flatly, crossing her arms as she pushed back from her desk. The wheels of her chair squeaked against the linoleum floor. ""Nobody deploys this level of resources for some freshman's stock picks. Try again, and this time, don't insult my intelligence.""

She reached beneath her desk and pulled out a small device, sliding it across the table toward Nick. It resembled a miniature circuit board with a thin antenna, no larger than a postage stamp. ""Know what this is?""

Nick examined it without touching—a small electronic component, possibly a transmitter. His enhanced perception detected a faint electromagnetic signature emanating from it, suggesting sophisticated technology beyond standard university equipment.

""I found it in my backpack yesterday,"" Maggie continued, eyes locked on his face, studying every microexpression. ""After our first meeting. Wouldn't have detected it if I didn't routinely scan my belongings. Very sophisticated. Military-grade."" Her voice hardened. ""So tell me why I shouldn't assume you planted it. Why I shouldn't conclude you're working for them.""

For a long moment, they stared at each other, a silent battle of wills. The tension in the room thickened until Nick could almost taste it—metallic and sharp, like blood.

""If I were working for them,"" Nick replied carefully, ""I wouldn't need to plant a tracker. I'd already know where to find you.""

""Not good enough,"" Maggie countered. ""Prove you're not with Callahan. Tell me something that only someone opposing them would know.""

Nick weighed his options, then decided on a calculated risk. ""The Zhang-Harrington paper from a couple years ago? It establishes the theoretical framework for neural interface regulation. Specifically designed to classify neural data as 'inherently neutral,' removing ethical oversight from the technology itself and placing it solely on the applications."" He leaned forward. ""The perfect shield for what they're really developing.""

Maggie's eyes widened slightly, her posture shifting from defensive to alert. ""Go on.""

""The paper argues for a 'data-agnostic' regulatory approach, claiming the technology itself can't be unethical—only its applications can. But that's corporate propaganda designed to create legal precedent."" Nick's voice remained quiet but intense. ""It's no accident that a Harrington co-authored that paper while Callahan Industries absorbs every neural tech startup they can get their hands on.""

He watched Maggie's reaction carefully. ""They're creating the legal and ethical framework that will protect their research from oversight, while simultaneously ensuring they control the development pipeline. When the technology is ready for mass deployment, they'll already own the intellectual property and have shaped the regulations to their advantage.""

*Classic military strategy,* Nick thought, recognizing the approach from Arlize's memories of political maneuvering. *Control the battlefield before the battle even begins.*

Something in Maggie's expression shifted—a recognition, perhaps even a confirmation of her own suspicions. She reached under her desk again, this time retrieving a folder with a red security stripe across it.

""My brother's final research memo before he disappeared,"" she said, sliding the folder halfway across the table but keeping her hand firmly on one corner. The folder seemed to pulse with importance in the dim blue light of the lab. ""He was investigating the same connections. Two days after writing this, his lab was shut down for 'administrative review.' A week later, all his research was classified and confiscated."" Her knuckles whitened around the folder's edge. ""Officially, he's on sabbatical. Unofficially, no one has seen him in eighteen months.""

She flipped through several pages, then paused at what appeared to be a personnel file. ""But that's not all he was investigating. Look at this.""

She turned the folder so Nick could see. It contained a list of former Callahan Industries employees who had worked on classified neural interface projects—researchers who had subsequently disappeared, died in accidents, or abruptly left the field. Two names near the top of the list made Nick's heart stop.

Marco and Sierra Valiente.

His parents' names seemed to glow on the page, jumping out from the surrounding text with impossible prominence. The sight triggered something deep within his consciousness—like a key unlocking a door he hadn't known existed.

""These were my parents,"" Nick said, his voice barely audible, fingers hovering over their names as if touching them might burn. The room around him seemed to recede, the present moment overlaid with memories bursting forth from some sealed compartment in his mind.

Maggie's eyes widened in shock. ""Your parents worked for Callahan? Why didn't you say so immediately?""

Nick barely heard her. Something cracked open inside him—like a dam breaking. A flood of images surged forward, sharp and undeniable. Memories he hadn't been able to access since his rebirth suddenly flooded back with vivid clarity.

His father's laugh, deep and resonant, filling their kitchen on Sunday mornings. His mother's hands, always smelling faintly of shea butter, gentle as they brushed his hair from his forehead. Their home—not the basic suburban house he'd remembered, but a modern, security-enhanced property set against woodlands, with a basement laboratory his parents had called ""the workshop.""

""I... couldn't remember them clearly,"" Nick admitted, the truth surprising even himself. ""Not since... not for a while."" As he spoke, blue energy pulsed beneath his skin, responding to the emotional surge. He forced it down, concentrating on maintaining control.

More memories cascaded through his consciousness—deeper, older memories that seemed to have been locked away somewhere in his mind. Summers in Colombia at his grandparents' estate, a sprawling property nestled against the mountains, with hidden rooms and ancient symbols carved into stone doorways. His grandfather's lessons in what he called ""the old ways,"" teaching Nick forms and stances that now reminded him eerily of the combat sequences he'd practiced in the gym.

And then, a memory crystallized with such sudden clarity that Nick gasped.

He was five years old, sitting cross-legged on the dojo floor as his parents demonstrated what they called ""the family gift."" His mother's hands glowing with the same blue energy that now flowed through his veins, forming patterns in the air that danced like living calligraphy. His father, manipulating the mana to create intricate structures that seemed to bridge dimensions—blueprints of reality itself.

Another memory surfaced—his mother kneeling before him when he was seven, taking his small hands in hers. ""The world is not ready to know about mana, *mi vida*. So you must keep this as our secret."" Her eyes serious but kind, the blue energy passing between them like a promise.

Then came the most vivid memory of all. He was ten, back in the dojo in Colombia. His parents and grandparents, standing in a circle around him, their hands glowing with blue light as they chanted in a language he didn't recognize—ancient words that seemed to resonate with the mana itself. The energy flowing from their fingertips, entering his body, sealing itself within him like a dormant seed waiting for the right moment to germinate.

""For your protection,"" his father had explained afterward, his face solemn. ""Until you are ready.""

His mother's voice, gentle but firm: ""The power is sealed within you, but it will awaken when you need it most. When the time comes, your body will remember.""

Years of watching his parents work late nights in their lab at Callahan Industries, glimpses of blue light beneath their lab coats when they thought no one was looking. Hushed conversations that stopped when he entered a room. Documents hidden away whenever visitors came to their home.

And finally, the memory he had buried deepest of all—the night his parents died.

He had awakened from a dream, his room filled with a soft blue glow. His parents standing at the foot of his bed, though he knew they had left hours earlier for a conference. Their forms were translucent, shimmering with mana energy, yet unmistakably present.

""We won't be coming home, Nicolás,"" his father had said, his image rippling like a reflection in disturbed water.

""But we will see you again,"" his mother promised, her smile sad but determined. ""The summer of your nineteenth birthday, go to your grandparents. They will reveal everything.""

""Remember,"" his father added, ""tell no one about the mana. It will protect you when you need it most.""

He had awakened the next morning to the news of their car accident. No one had believed him when he said he'd already known they were gone.

""They weren't just researchers,"" Nick whispered, the revelation hitting him like a physical blow. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in rhythm with his racing heart, responding to the emotional surge.

*The mana—it wasn't an experiment or a drug. It's in our blood.*

Maggie was watching him with calculated intensity, her expression shifting from suspicion to cautious interest. ""Your parents' death. When and how?""

""Car accident,"" Nick replied automatically, the official story ingrained in his memory. ""Two years ago, the summer before my junior year. Brake failure on a mountain road.""

""And you've never questioned it?""

""I..."" Nick hesitated, his newfound memories colliding with the public narrative. ""Part of me always knew it wasn't an accident. But I couldn't—didn't want to face it.""

Maggie slid the folder closer to him, her finger tapping a notation beside his parents' names. ""According to my brother's research, your parents were working on something called 'Project Rebirth.' On paper, they were developing neural interfaces for Callahan Industries, but my brother believed they had their own agenda. Three weeks after they filed a patent application that mentioned 'bio-energetic potential activation,' they died. The patent was immediately classified and reassigned to Callahan Industries.""

The world seemed to tilt around Nick, reality itself shifting on its axis. His parents hadn't just worked for Callahan—they were using their positions to research mana, perhaps finding ways to integrate their family heritage with modern technology. Was ""Project Rebirth"" a cover for something much older, much more fundamental than neural interfaces?

*They were studying the Arcadian System,* Nick realized with sudden clarity. *Not creating it—documenting what already existed in our bloodline.*

""I was supposed to visit my grandparents this summer,"" Nick said quietly, the realization hitting him with sudden force. ""After my nineteenth birthday. My parents said they would explain everything then.""

""Where are your grandparents now?"" Maggie asked, her voice softer than before.

""Colombia. My father's parents. I haven't seen them since the funeral."" Another connection clicked into place. ""They never wanted me to go to Westlake. They insisted I should attend university in Bogotá instead.""

""They were trying to keep you away from Callahan Industries,"" Maggie surmised, understanding dawning in her eyes.

Nick nodded slowly, his mind racing. This changed everything. The timeline he'd been operating on suddenly compressed dramatically. If his parents had intended him to visit his grandparents this summer—just months from now—then whatever they had been preparing him for was imminent.

""I need to see everything your brother had on Project Rebirth,"" Nick said, his voice steadier than he felt. The initial shock was giving way to focused determination, Arlize's tactical mind integrating this new information into evolving strategy. ""And I need to contact my grandparents without alerting whoever's watching me.""

Maggie's eyes narrowed slightly as she assessed him. ""Your grandparents might be in danger too if Callahan connects them to whatever your parents were working on. Any conventional contact method would be flagged immediately.""

Nick nodded grimly. The realization that his family in Colombia might be under surveillance had been weighing on him. If his parents' research into mana was as valuable as it seemed, Callahan wouldn't overlook any potential source of information.

""I've been thinking about that,"" he said. ""Is there a way to establish secure communication channels that wouldn't trigger monitoring systems?""

Maggie tapped her fingers thoughtfully on the desk, the rhythm matching the pulse of the blue light from her equipment. ""Possibly. I might be able to route messages through multiple proxy servers, maybe use old-school radio frequencies as an intermediary step."" She frowned. ""But first things first. We need to understand exactly what we're dealing with and secure what we already have.""

Nick leaned forward, the gravity of his situation settling over him like a physical weight. The memory of his parents' spectral visit, their warning about the mana, the connection to his grandparents in Colombia—it all pointed to something bigger than he had initially realized. This wasn't just about revenge against those who betrayed him; it was about uncovering the truth his parents had died to protect.

A truth that somehow connected his family's ancient heritage to Arlize Dentragon and the Arcadian System. The pieces were beginning to align, though the full picture remained frustratingly unclear.

""So where do we go from here?"" he asked.

Maggie reached for a drawer, extracting what looked like a modified USB drive. Its casing was non-standard—matte black with reinforced edges and what appeared to be a biometric scanner built into one side. ""First, better protection for your data. This is a secure storage device with military-grade encryption and an isolated operation system. Transfer your sensitive files to this, then wipe your laptop completely. If they're monitoring your digital activities, give them nothing useful.""

She slid the drive across the table. It felt unusually heavy in Nick's palm, the metal warm as if containing its own energy source. ""Second, your grandparents. We'll need to be extremely careful when contacting them. Any direct communication would be flagged immediately."" She tapped something into her keyboard, then turned the monitor so Nick could see a diagram of interconnected nodes.

""I've been developing a communication system that uses multiple layers of obfuscation. Messages are broken into fragments, encrypted, and routed through a series of dead drops across disconnected networks before being reassembled at the destination."" Her eyes narrowed with focus as she scrolled through the complex schematic. ""It was originally designed to communicate with my brother if he ever resurfaced. I can adapt it to establish a secure channel to Colombia.""

""How would they receive it? My grandparents aren't exactly tech-savvy,"" Nick said, thinking of his grandfather who still preferred handwritten letters to email.

*Huh, now that I know the Arcadian system is in their blood, it is weird that he always preferred handwritten letters…*

Maggie nodded. ""The final delivery needs to be analog—something that wouldn't raise flags. I know people in Bogotá who could function as couriers, delivering messages that appear completely innocent but contain encrypted information.""

She pulled up another file on her computer. ""The real challenge is finding a way to notify them to expect contact without alerting surveillance systems. Do you have any pre-established codes or signals that would make sense to them but not to anyone monitoring?""

Nick thought back to his childhood visits. ""My grandfather used to insert classified ads in local newspapers when he wanted to contact old colleagues without using official channels. He called it his 'fisherman's signal'—something about bait and weather forecasts.""

""Perfect,"" Maggie said with a hint of a smile. ""Old-school tradecraft. Analog methods are harder to detect in digital surveillance sweeps."" She made a quick note. ""I'll set this up within the week. But for now, we have more immediate concerns.""

She turned back to her original screen. ""Third, we need more information about this Project Rebirth. I can hack into some university servers, but Callahan's systems are another level entirely.""

""Professor Harrington is giving a private lecture on neural interface ethics this Thursday,"" Nick offered. ""Invitation only, but I'm on the list.""

Maggie's eyebrows rose. ""How did you manage that?""

""Professor Feldman added me.""

""Interesting."" Maggie leaned back, considering this new information. ""Feldman has connections to military research programs. Her recommendation isn't casual.""

""I thought as much,"" Nick replied. ""The question is whether she's testing me or offering an opportunity.""

""Possibly both."" Maggie turned to one of her monitors, typing rapidly. ""We need surveillance equipment. If you're attending that lecture, we should capture everything possible—audio, video, data transmissions."" Her fingers paused over the keyboard. ""But there's something else we need to discuss first.""

She turned to face him directly. ""Why am I being watched? If I'm on their radar because of my brother, that makes sense. But the timing suggests our connection is what triggered escalated surveillance. So I need to know exactly what you've done to attract this level of attention.""

The directness of her question left little room for evasion. Nick considered his options carefully.

""In my previous investigation, I accessed restricted university servers,"" he admitted. ""I might have left digital footprints they could trace.""

""Amateur move,"" Maggie muttered. ""But that doesn't explain everything. You're hiding something significant—something that makes you valuable or dangerous to them."" She fixed him with an unblinking stare. ""I need to know what it is before I risk my freedom or my life helping you.""

The moment stretched between them, taut with tension. Nick was about to respond when the white noise generator on the table suddenly emitted a high-pitched whine, its blue light flashing rapidly.

Maggie moved with startling speed, switching off monitors and grabbing essential equipment. ""Electromagnetic interference,"" she hissed. ""Someone's scanning this room.""

Nick rose immediately, adrenaline surging through his system, the mana responding automatically to perceived threat. He felt the blue energy coiling beneath his skin, ready to manifest if needed. ""How close?""

""Too close."" She shoved a backpack into his hands. ""Take this. Back exit through the specimen storage room. Go now, and don't contact me electronically. I'll find you.""

Before Nick could respond, three sharp knocks struck the door with deliberate precision.

""Ms. Zhang?"" A male voice, measured and authoritative. ""Campus security. Please open the door.""

Maggie's eyes met Nick's, a silent message passing between them. She tilted her head toward a narrow door at the back of the lab, then turned toward the main entrance.

""One moment!"" she called, her voice suddenly transformed into that of a harried student. ""Just finishing an experiment!""

As she moved toward the front door, making deliberate noise to cover his retreat, Nick slipped through the back exit into a cramped storage room lined with refrigeration units. The air was colder here, carrying the sterile scent of preservatives and cleaning agents. A service door at the far end bore an exit sign above it, the red glow casting crimson shadows across steel cabinets.

Behind him, he heard Maggie opening the main door, her voice pitched to sound confused and slightly annoyed. ""Can I help you? I have this room reserved until six.""

""Routine security check, Ms. Zhang. May we come in?""

Nick didn't wait to hear more. He moved silently through the storage room, his enhanced senses scanning for any sign of additional security personnel. The hallway beyond the service door would lead to a back stairwell—if it wasn't already covered.

His hand closed around the door handle, and he paused, listening intently. Nothing from the other side. He eased the door open a fraction of an inch, peering through the crack. The corridor beyond appeared empty, but a faint shadow shifted at the far end—someone waiting just around the corner.

Nick closed his eyes briefly, reaching for the mana that flowed through him. Not for combat, but for enhanced perception. The blue energy responded instantly, flowing to his senses, sharpening his awareness of his surroundings. With his hearing amplified, he detected the subtle electronic hum of communications equipment and the controlled breathing pattern of someone trained to maintain position for extended periods.

The sensation was remarkable—sound separated into distinct layers, each accessible with focused attention. The guard's heartbeat, slightly elevated but steady. The soft crackle of a radio earpiece, volume turned low. The whisper of fabric as the person shifted weight from one foot to another.

*Definitely security, possibly military,* Nick assessed. *And they're blocking my escape route.*

Nick silently closed the door and assessed his options. The storage room had no windows, no other exits. He was effectively trapped unless... His gaze shifted upward, noting the removable ceiling tiles and ventilation system.

Moving quickly but quietly, Nick climbed onto one of the refrigeration units, carefully sliding a ceiling tile aside to reveal the space above. The building's blueprints, which he'd studied before coming, indicated this section connected to a main ventilation shaft that ran throughout the third floor.

With practiced efficiency, he pulled himself up into the ceiling space, replacing the tile behind him. The confined darkness enveloped him, dust tickling his nostrils as he oriented himself. The ventilation shaft should be two meters to his right.

As he carefully shifted his weight across the ceiling frame, he heard the main door to the lab open wider.

""—just need to verify all authorized personnel,"" a man's voice said, professional but with an underlying tension.

""I'm the only one scheduled for this lab today,"" Maggie responded, her tone perfectly balanced between cooperation and annoyance. ""You can check the reservation system if you want.""

""We have reason to believe an unauthorized individual may have accessed this area,"" a second voice stated. ""Have you noticed anyone suspicious?""

""Just you guys,"" Maggie retorted. ""Look, I have components cooling that need attention in five minutes. If you want to search the place, go ahead, but I've got deadlines.""

Nick reached the ventilation shaft, a metal passage large enough for him to crawl through, though barely. He eased himself into it, moving with glacial slowness to prevent any sound that might give away his position. The metal was cool against his palms as he began the painstaking process of navigating away from the lab.

""We'll need to check the storage room as well,"" the first voice said, growing louder as they approached the back area.

""Fine, whatever. Just be careful with the specimen refrigerators. Some of those samples are irreplaceable.""

Footsteps approached the storage room door. Nick froze, suspending his weight perfectly to prevent the metal from creaking. Below him, the door opened, light spilling into the storage room.

""Clear,"" said the security officer after a cursory inspection.

""Told you,"" Maggie replied, her voice carrying just the right amount of irritated relief.

Nick remained motionless until the storage room door closed again, then resumed his careful progress through the ventilation system. According to the building layout, if he continued forward for approximately twenty meters, he would reach a junction that connected to a vertical shaft leading down to the second floor, where another maintenance access panel would allow him to exit.

As he inched forward in the confined space, a realization struck him. The security team hadn't been thorough in their search—almost as if they didn't actually expect to find him. Their approach had been methodical but shallow. Not the actions of people who genuinely believed their target was present, but rather a performance designed to flush out someone they suspected might be there.

*This wasn't a random security check,* Nick thought. *Someone had clocked his entry—and now they wanted to see who he was meeting and why.*

After fifteen agonizing minutes of silent progress through the ventilation system, Nick reached the access panel he sought. He waited, listening carefully for any sounds from the hallway beyond. Detecting nothing, he carefully removed the panel and lowered himself into an empty maintenance closet on the second floor.

He emerged into a quieter part of the building, straightening his clothes and adopting the casual demeanor of a student going about routine business. The backpack Maggie had given him felt heavy against his shoulders, its contents unknown but certainly valuable enough for her to risk discovery by passing them to him.

Nick made his way to the nearest exit, senses heightened for any sign of pursuit or surveillance. The campus beyond seemed deceptively normal—students crossing the quad with backpacks and coffee cups, professors hurrying between buildings, the evening air filled with the usual ambient sounds of university life.

*Amazing how the world keeps spinning while your entire reality gets rewritten,* Nick thought, sighing as he watched a group of freshmen laughing as they passed him. *They're worried about midterms, I'm trying to figure out how my dead parents knew about interdimensional magic-tech.*

Checking his watch, Nick realized he needed to maintain his normal schedule to avoid suspicion. That meant continuing with his classes and campus activities while simultaneously investigating the revelations about his parents and the mysterious Project Rebirth.

His thoughts drifted to his grandparents in Colombia. The memory of their sprawling estate nestled against the mountains provided a stark contrast to his current situation—hunted on a campus that increasingly felt like a gilded cage. His grandfather, Francisco Valiente, had been a military strategist before retiring to manage the family's coffee plantation. The old man had always seemed to know more than he let on, his keen eyes missing nothing, his casual references to ""the old ways"" taking on new significance now that Nick understood the truth about mana.

Would his grandparents be able to explain what was happening to him? The merging with Arlize, the blue energy, the sealed memories now breaking free? His mother's words echoed in his memory: ""The summer of your nineteenth birthday, go to your grandparents. They will reveal everything.""

He was still months away from that deadline, but with Callahan Industries closing in, waiting until summer might not be an option. If Maggie's secure communication system worked, he could at least warn them that he might need to arrive earlier than planned.

His phone vibrated in his pocket. A text message from an unknown number: ""Thursday lecture – trap or opportunity? Either way, prepare carefully. Data key in backpack. Use only on air-gapped system. – M""

Nick deleted the message immediately after reading it, scanning his surroundings once more. No obvious tails, but that meant little in an age of surveillance cameras and remote monitoring. He continued toward his dorm, mind racing through contingency plans. If his room was bugged, he couldn't examine the backpack's contents there. He needed a secure location, an air-gapped computer as Maggie had suggested, and time to process whatever information she had passed to him.

More importantly, he needed to understand why they were watching him specifically. What did they know—or suspect—about his connection to Arlize? His rebirth? About the mana that now flowed through his veins? And what role had his own parents played in creating whatever he had become?

If his grandparents had the answers, finding a way to reach them safely was now just as critical as evading Callahan's surveillance. The classified ad system Maggie planned to use might work, but Nick wondered if there might be other, older channels his family had established—perhaps something connected to the mana itself.

The early September sunset painted the campus in shades of amber and gold as Nick walked to his dorm, the beauty a stark contrast to the web of secrets and surveillance closing around him. The blue energy pulsed beneath his skin in rhythm with his heartbeat, a silent reminder of the power flowing through his veins—power his parents had known about, had studied, had perhaps died to protect.

*I'm coming for answers,* Nick promised silently, his resolve hardening. *And then, I'm coming for justice.*

I have had the worst travel constipation I have ever had. It has been a week with absolutely nothing happening. I have not experienced genuine hunger since Friday.

I’ve been chugging water, eating as much fruit as I can (including prunes!) and walking about as much as anyone can in 32 degree heat.

Then, we came upon it. Dulcolax, in a pharmacy, which I made my boyfriend purchase as though for him, as it was important to me to preserve my dignity (ho ho ho).

I was looking forward to taking it all day. We got in after dinner, and I finally cracked open a beer (had been avoiding alcohol to avoid further dehydration) and took my dose. It was recommended to take one, but the thought of that not working sent me into a spiral, so two tablets it was.

In what was retrospect a stupid move, I proceeded to have more and more beer, to celebrate the no-doubt completely normal bowel movement which lay ahead of me.

Friends.

What commenced in the early hours of the following morning was a four hour saga of misery.

I awoke at 5am experiencing, essentially, active labour. I clutched my boyfriend’s hand, panted my way through it, and ran full pelt to the one bathroom we shared in this flat. The one with no air conditioning and shower basin, with humidity of approximately 120%. 

I will say, in its defence, the first 6 poops were normal. It was only the last three that went into ‘serious illness’ territory. Every so often the pain would ease and I would hear a frightening gurgle, which was my cue to run. 

His parents were awake by the middle stages, his mum shouting ‘why didn’t you just tell us, we would have gotten fruit’ and scolding my partner in Hokkien. 

‘I *am* fruit, Giak Siew!’ I shouted, for she knew not of how many mangoes I had consumed in my efforts to be free of this.

In the later stages of my delirium, I sat in that steamy bathroom, traumatised, thinking of the 
 Chinese wedding dress fitting I attended the previous day, with a saleswoman who kept slapping her hips and shaking her head when we asked for a different colour, like a surgeon delivering bad news to a family. 

‘I bet I could fit into that smaller size now’, I murmured.

‘What?’ Came the concerned reply from beyond the door.

Eventually, I stumbled back to bed at 9am and slept. I awoke ravenous, at peace, empty, and consumed three bowls of rice and a coffee. The sun is shining. Birds are singing. It is a new day.

(Mainly surreal with comedy mixed in)","Just in the mood for good comedy but want something really surreal, weird or horror mixed in the podcast. Good worldbiilding and lore is a plus

Some podcasts kinda like this that I  like and may recommend are : 

- Hello From the Magic Tavern (My Favourite) : Arnie Niekamp fell through a dimensional portal behind a Burger King into the fantastical land of Foon. He's still getting a slight wifi signal, so he uploads a weekly podcast from the tavern the Vermilion Minotaur where he interviews wizards, monsters and adventurers. It's a major discovery!

- Last Podcast on The Left (Also My Favourite) : The Last Podcast on the Left covers all the horrors our world has to offer, both imagined and real. From demons and slashers to cults and serial killers, The Last Podcast is guaranteed to satisfy your bloodlust.

- Milk Man of St Gaffs : Lovecraft meets Kafka in this serialized fantasy/horror podcast about Howie, a troubled young man who joins the milkmen on the island of St. Gaff's, only to discover that the milkmen harbor a dark and dangerous secret. Be sure to start with episode one!

- Return Home : Return Home is a serialized comedy/horror story that follows Jonathan, Buddy, and Ami as they unravel the mysteries of Melancholy Falls. Isn't time for you to return home?

- Beef and Dairy Network : The number one podcast for those involved or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds.

- Desert Skies : On a lonely highway between life and the next life there's one last stop that we all have to make. Desert Skies Astral Plane Fuel and Service Station serves travelers as they embark on their journey through the celestial spheres. Meet the Attendant, the Mechanic, and C.A.S.H. Register. Together, they'll make sure you're prepared for the ride.

- Midnight Burger : When Gloria took a waitressing job at a diner outside of Phoenix, she didn't realize she was now an employee of Midnight Burger, a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner. Every day Midnight Burger appears somewhere new in the cosmos along with it's staff: a galactic drifter, a rogue theoretical physicist, a sentient old-timey radio, and some guy named Caspar. No one knows who built Midnight Burger or how it works, but when it appears there's always someone around who could really use a cup of coffee.
At the nexus of all things, there is a diner. We open at 6.

- Gamma Radio : Madcap post-apocalyptic radio style comedy. With inspiration from video games, pop-culture and sci-fi. Warning: Heavily irradiated.

- Squad Car 22 : Back in the 90s two police officers were promoted from bicycle cops to real ones. With the help of their trusty tape recorder they started chronicling their time protecting and serving America. Ride along with Officer Steins and Holloway as they save the world from a Mad Scientist, a Squid-Pig, a Talking Campari Bottle, and Jewish Space Lasers.

- Nowhere, on Air : Semi-late night community radio broadcasts from a strange little town in the Crowsnest Pass, Alberta (aka, not just the middle of nowhere, but nowhere itself). Nothing ever happens here.

Certainly nothing weird. Why would you even suggest that? Listen close. Don't wander off. It's a long way to get where you're going. Especially out here.

I have a few side hustles I want to turn into a business ( art and beauty products). I haven't gotten around to making it a business yet but I want to. I also was thinking about pursuing visual communications at my local community college (I won't be paying out of pocket much at all if not any) for marketing and online writing work. I understand professional communications is geared more towards writing, but as a creative person I thought the VC would make more sense. I know that this type of job doesn't have a set salary and it soley depends on you and how you work. But then I look at other assocaties degrees that generlaly pay more such as dental hygene, nursing, tech etc. However, I hate the idea of it. I mean I don't HATE the idea, it just doesn't sound like something I would enjoy long term. I understand you need to make money to live, and believe me I know, I'm poverty level rn. For context I'm 18 and my family moved back in with my grandparents temporarily bc we couldn't get a home. I'm applying for jobs, but no one is responding lol. I have this desire to sell my paintings and beauty products. As well as writing. I would love to be a freelance writer, I just don't know where to start. I'm writing a children's book rn too.  Another thing is handling peoples marketing in regard to the look of their business building, profile online etc.  I just think of everything, and I want to open a coffee shop in the future whenever I'm somewhat financially ready.

I've currently taken Ozempic for about 4.5 months to prepare for my wedding next year.  For reference, I am a 32, 5'9, woman.

  I didn't have a lot of the side effects reported on this board.  After my first dosage, I did not feel the need to eat ANYTHING.  Like, I'd feel like buying food or ordering food and still do but when it is in front of me, I have zero desire to eat it.  

At best, I've been sustaining myself on an insane amount of seltzer, water, Diet Coke, and coffee, plus anything with electrolytes and a teaspoon of salt a day.  I also have bulk ordered mini Hershey bars and lollipops and have about 2-4 of the latter to keep my stomach from grumbling at work.  

However, I've gone from 179 pounds to 127 pounds in the last few months.  The last time I was in the 120s, I was literally in sixth grade.  

I get dizzy all the time, despite taking supplements, and have some really scary moments where I can't see for about half a minute if I get up too quickly.  At the same time, I no longer feel like my husband to be will be disappointed in me and I look better than I have in forever (I've gotten Juvederm long before I started Ozempic and I think that helped me from getting sagging skin).  

That said, I want to stop Ozempic but I'm worried that between me stress binge eating, which caused me to gain weight in the first place, plus my wedding still being next year, I will gain the weight back and then some.  

Has anyone gotten passed their goal weight and either stopped or found a way to get over the loss of appetite and stayed at a consistent weight while on it?  I want my husband to be to be happy and I want my parents to be happy at my wedding.  Personally, I'd also like to be happy, which I was in the second picture but now I feel I look too extreme but I don't know how to go back without having to redo this whole process again.  

Sorry if this was more of a ramble.  I just don't know what to do. ",0,1749697261.0,Ozempic,10,0.33,False
1l9bupq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1l9bupq/i_cannot_sleep_normally_for_the_last_7_days/,I cannot sleep normally for the last 7 days,"Hi, I’m 21F and I’ve never had issues with sleep before. This all started exactly a week ago. One night, I just couldn’t fall asleep at all. I lay in bed all night, totally unsure if I even drifted off or if I was awake the whole time. It felt like my brain was switched on the entire night and I couldn’t shut it off.  

On the fourth day, a friend took me to the gym in the evening. That night I finally slept normally after three bad nights. But the next night, the insomnia came back. For the past couple of days, my sleep has felt really weird. I don’t feel sleepy, and when I lie still for a long time, I ‘might’ fall asleep but it doesn’t even feel like real sleep. My mind stays awake and I’m still aware of what I’m thinking or imagining. It’s not a dream, just conscious thoughts I can control. Then after 4–5 hours, my brain suddenly “wakes up” on its own, and I struggle to fall back asleep.  

I started to feel emotionally low, foggy, exhausted, and my skin’s breaking out. My face also looks puffier and more aged than usual.  And I stopped drinking coffee after the first sleepless night (I usually just have one cup in the morning). I’m not under any stress, there’s been no major change in my diet or lifestyle. My period is due next week, but this has never happened around my cycle before. I’ve always been healthy.  

The only possible factor I can think of is that I stopped going to the gym about two months ago due to work and exams. I also started fish oil supplements but have been taking them inconsistently.  

That’s all I can think of. If anyone has insight, I’d be so grateful this is starting to really affect my wellbeing.  ",1,1749697247.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I do heavily regret ever getting into psychology. I had hopes to get into the Master of Business Administration program at my university, but this semester I've accrued 4 thousand dollars for my tuition and I've maxed out my financial aid, and subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The financial aid office at my university told me that I'd have to take out a personal loan. I plan on taking out a credit card with 0% interest for 15 months, and putting in $500 a month to pay it all up before the 15 months are up. 

  
My GPA is incredibly mediocre. I used to have a 3.2, but it shot down to 3.0 because I had 3 hard classes (research methods, statistics, and a math course). So there's no hope that I can ever get scholarships based on that. I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to get an MBA and go into HR or project management. I feel stuck now, I know I can try to get a case manager position because a BA in Psychology is required. But what do I do now? I don't want to be stuck working retail positions forever, and I don't want to work in the psych world.

We hadn’t spoken much since then until a few days ago. I got drunk at a party and texted her I didn’t say anything wild, just that I missed us and still had unresolved feelings and anger about what she did and that I wanted to get it off my chest. She responded, and eventually, I asked if she wanted to meet up and talk.

We were supposed to meet at a coffee shop, but due to time constraints, I invited her over to my apartment instead.

We had a long conversation, I expressed my frustrations about the past, and it felt cathartic. But emotions got high, and we ended up having sex. I’ll be honest: that wasn’t my intention when I invited her over, but it happened.

The next morning, I realized I was still confused and, more importantly, that I still didn’t trust her. I texted her and said that unless we were both 100% ready to try again seriously, it wasn’t healthy to reconnect. I apologized for any mixed signals and told her I shouldn’t have said I missed her or invited her over if it would’ve made her think I wanted to get back together.

She replied saying she thought the night meant we were getting back together, and that I played with her feelings. She was really upset and said I led her on.

Here’s the thing, I genuinely didn’t know she came into the night expecting to rekindle things. She never said that. If I had known, I wouldn’t have let things unfold like that. I thought we were just catching up and getting closure. I apologized sincerely, but I still feel guilty.

I was enjoying the Morphy Richards coffee machine but now it's time to upgrade.
So, now I am looking for a proper espresso extracting machine. So far I have looked at Blue tokai's Mage, a few of budan machine and some from other brands.
My budget is in between 20k to 40k. Please suggest me a good espresso machine. ",3,1749696799.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

Just a door away, the conversation in that hospital corner continued.  
  
""Get ready. While Celia's still unconscious, go ahead and perform the hysterectomy!""  
  
Dr. Davis stood there, completely stunned.  
  
""You want to remove Mrs.Ravenscroft's uterus?!""  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, I have to remind you—you don't have any children right now. If you really remove your wife's uterus, you'll never have an heir!""  
  
""I don't need an heir. Ashley gave birth to my child yesterday. I promised her I'd leave everything to our baby. Keeping Celia's uterus... it's a threat.""  
  
The doctor looked pained, speaking urgently,""But your child with Miss Green will still take someone else's name, call someone else daddy. Mr. Ravenscroft, is this really worth it? Besides, after seven miscarriages,Mrs.Ravenscroft's chances of getting pregnant again are already so low.""  
  
Dante lit a cigar, his voice tender yet bitter.  
  
""Worth it? There's no question about worth. I love Ashley, and I'll give her everything I have.""  
  
""But—""  
  
Dante's brow furrowed.  
  
""Enough! Just do what I fucking told you!""  
  
Just as Dante was about to get up, his phone rang. He accidentally hit speakerphone.  
  
""Dante, bro, got the money! Heh, call me for this kind of gig anytime. I've done it seven times now—got it down to a science. And next time, I've got it all planned out. I'll pretend to be a kidnapper and go straight for the wife's belly—""  
  
""There won't be a next time. Take your money and get the hell out of the city!""  
  
Footsteps echoed from inside.  
  
I stumbled back to my room, barely making it before Dante walked in.  
  
""Celia, when did you wake up?""  
  
I was drenched in sweat, my body trembling as I tried to stay calm.  
  
""Just now... I noticed you weren't here, so I was about to go look for you.""  
  
Dante's gaze fixed on me, studying, suspicious.  
  
My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. Just when I thought he'd figured it out, he picked me up and placed me back on the bed.  
  
""How can you be so careless with yourself? We've already lost the baby—I can't lose you too.""  
  
The fucking nerve of him to even mention it.  
  
Thinking about my babies—the ones he'd deliberately killed—I clutched my chest as tears threatened to overflow.  
  
All those car accidents, robberies, falls... none of it was coincidence.  
  
It was my husband. For his mistress. Again and again, he'd tried to kill me.  
  
""The doctor said your uterus wasn't properly cleaned out. You need another surgery.""  
  
""Don't be scared, Celia. We'll have a beautiful baby someday—with your eyes and my nose and mouth. When that happens, we'll love him twice as much, make up for everything we've lost.""  
  
Dante handed me a glass of milk. As he turned slightly, I caught him slipping something into it.  
  
He held me close, whispering sweet comfort, his eyes full of what looked like genuine concern.  
  
But I knew better. This was all just another lie to keep me quiet.  
  
""Do I... do I have to drink this? Can't I skip it?""  
  
Dante, you've killed seven of my children. Now you want to take away my last chance to be a mother too?  
  
Without hesitation, he stroked my hair with that indulgent smile,  
  
""Come on, you're a grown woman acting like a little kid. If you don't have the surgery, how will your body heal? You want me to be heartbroken?""  
  
""Here, let me help you.""  
  
He brought the milk to my lips, giving me no choice but to drink.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut. It felt like I was swallowing razor blades instead of milk.  
  
My consciousness began to fade. Through the haze, I saw that corrupt doctor walking in.  
  
""Start the surgery now. And also...""  
  
Dante's voice hesitated for a few seconds.  
  
""Find a way to use the anesthesia to paralyze her legs.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, is this really necessary? Isn't this a bit... extreme?""  
  
""Just do what I fucking said!""  
  
I knew Dante was always cautious and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me wake up early would make him this ruthless.  
  
My children, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to stand—he wanted to take it all away.  
  
Dante, is this how you're going to destroy me completely?  
  
I screamed in despair, struggling to sit up, but I was sinking deeper into unconsciousness.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the doctor's voice through the haze,  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, Mrs. Ravenscroft's uterus has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Dante sounded absolutely delighted""Good! Excellent!""  
  
When I finally came to, his tears were falling on my hands—such convincing, heartbroken performance.  
  
""Celia, the doctor says your uterus was infected... you'll never be able to have children in the rest of your live.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
But there was nothing... no feeling at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded,""Dante, what the hell did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face as he choked up, barely able to speak.  
  
""There was a complication with the anesthesia... you're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, Celia... no matter what happens to you, I'll never leave you, I'll always love you.""  
  
I never knew Dante was such a damn good actor.  
  
He dismissed the nurses and took care of everything himself—feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even dealing with the postpartum bleeding.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""Celia, you've suffered so much carrying our babies. I promise I'll make it up to you.""  
  
I looked at his exhausted face and coldly turned away.  
  
""If you're tired, get some sleep.""  
  
""Alright, I'll stay right here. Just call me if you need anything.""  
  
Once he fell asleep, I grabbed his other phone.  
  
I'd always known Dante had a second phone—his work phone—but I'd never bothered checking it.  
  
It unlocked on the first try.  
  
The password was Ashley Green's birthday.  
  
The moment the screen lit up, I was staring at a wedding photo of him and Ashley.  
  
A fucking wedding photo...  
  
He'd actually taken wedding photos with Ashley. The sight of that white dress made my eyes hurt.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. Dante called her ""baby""...  
  
Pages and pages of chat history. The more I read, the more horrified I became.  
  
Every single business trip he'd taken was just an excuse to be with Ashley.  
  
I'd gotten upset so many times because he never came with me to doctor appointments.  
  
How many times had doctors asked about the baby's father, and I'd just smile awkwardly and say he was in business.  
  
He'd always take forever to reply,  
  
""I'm working to earn money for our baby. Besides, checkups aren't a big deal. I can't really help anyway, and it would just waste time. You can handle it yourself,all right?""  
  
But he went to every single one of Ashley's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy he was, he never missed one.  
  
He said he couldn't wait for their baby to be born, that she and their child were the most precious things in his world.  
  
As I kept reading, my heart felt like it was being ripped apart.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they'd discuss how to kill my baby.  
  
Even that car accident when I was pregnant a year ago—Ashley hit me herself.  
  
She said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone, and Dante was all for it.  
  
His only concern was""Just don't hit too hard.""  
  
They talked about hurting me, about killing my children, as casually as discussing the weather.  
  
My nails dug so deep into my palms that blood dripped onto the sheets.  
  
I opened the photo album—thousands of pictures, all featuring Ashley. Selfies, candid shots, the two of them waking up together, taking walks, going home, Dante lovingly preparing nutritious meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos too. I clicked on them and felt like someone had dumped ice water over me.  
  
Countless videos of them naked, intertwined, sexed,like they were documenting every intimate moment.  
  
There was even cosplay shit—Dante in a maid outfit, kneeling on the floor...  
  
I pressed my hand to my stomach, too nauseous to speak.  
  
Besides those videos, there were six more labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way up to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they were, my blood ran cold and I tasted copper in my throat.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit my lip hard and clicked on the sixth video.  
  
Dante and Ashley were chatting and laughing together.  
  
Right in front of them was...  
  
That blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My heart felt like it was being sliced into a thousand pieces, and my stomach began cramping violently.  
  
I couldn't hold it back anymore—I leaned over the bed and dry heaved uncontrollably.  
  
I didn't sleep all night, tears soaking through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Dante brought me breakfast as usual—a thoughtful spread he'd personally picked out.  
  
Such variety: coffee,hamburger, bread, sandwich...  
  
I used to think this was his way of spoiling me. Now I realized it was just thoughtless, half-hearted bullshit.  
  
Remembering last night's videos, I started dry heaving again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Dante looked genuinely concerned,""Still feeling sick? Fuck, this is all my fault. I hate seeing you suffer like this.""  
  
""It's nothing. I want to go home.""  
  
Dante's expression froze for just a moment.  
  
""You just had another miscarriage... Mom's not too satisfied about it. If you go back now, you'll just walk right into her rage. Maybe wait a bit longer? Save yourself the grief.""  
  
I didn't respond, but from his expression, I could guess what was really going on.  
  
That afternoon, while he was out, I packed my things and wheeled myself home.  
  
The moment I entered the house, I saw Ashley sitting in Dante's lap while they both played with a baby.  
  
Dante's mom,Sophia came out of the kitchen carrying a bowl of chicken soup, personally feeding Ashley spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them were laughing together like the perfect family.  
  
When she saw me come in, Sophia's eyes turned razor-sharp.  
  
""You cursed bitchHow dare you show your face here! We promised you everything, and how do you repay us? Someone as unlucky as you should've just died out there!""  
  
""You knew damn well you were pregnant, but you kept running around like a maniac. How many of our babies have you destroyed? Why the hell didn't that fall just kill you, you worthless piece of trash!""  
  
""I'm telling you right now—from today on, Ashley is my only daughter-in-law!Get the fuck out of my house!""  
  
Ashley followed Sophia's gaze and looked over at me, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction,  
  
""Mom, don't say things like that. What if she gets jealous and starts spreading rumors about me seducing Dante?""  
  
""Let's see if she dares!""  
  
I knew Sophia had never liked me. She thought I was too strong-willed, too hard to control, that I'd walk all over Dante after marriage.  
  
But Ashley was beautiful and sweet-talking, always putting Sophia and Dante at the center of everything. So Sophia had always wanted Ashley as Mrs.Ravenscroft.  
  
It was only after Ashley married some rich guy and I willingly gave up my career to focus on family that Sophia reluctantly accepted me.  
  
After years of not giving the family an heir, her dissatisfaction with me had reached its peak.  
  
Now that Ashley was back and had given Dante a son, Sophia felt free to unleash all her pent-up resentment on me.  
  
But she had no idea that all seven of my miscarriages were personally orchestrated by her precious son!  
  
Every single one of her grandsons had been killed by Ashley—the daughter-in-law she treasured so much.  
  
In the past, Dante would try to mediate. But now, holding the child Ashley had given him, he acted like he couldn't hear any of it.  
  
Ashley snuggled into his arms, her voice deliberately pouty,  
  
""Dante, baby,you're paying so much attention to our son that I'm feeling left out. If you keep this up, I'm going to get upset.""  
  
Dante affectionately pinched her cheek, his eyes full of tenderness.  
  
""I know you get jealous easily. Look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Ashley's gaze and saw the words ""Share Transfer Agreement"" blazing before my eyes.  
  
""Oh wow! Dante, you're so good to me!""  
  
She kissed him on the corner of his mouth, her eyes smugly meeting mine.  
  
I gave her a cold smile in return.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
It won't be long before you and your precious Dante are crying and begging me to come back...

First time trying beans from Papa New Guinea and this literally tastes like Toblerone, specifically the chocolate + nougat combo. It’s super duper smooth and sweet but without any bitter aftertaste. Tastes like a very clean toblerone drink for pourover but can also be a sweeter + pistachio-like toblerone drink if done with Aeropress. I usually prefer juicy tea like finishes from Colombian coffee but this surprised me so much that I ended up really liking it.

As an added bonus, this is hands down the best looking packaging I have ever bought.

Nomadic Lifestyle Guide,"*🚀 Want to know your earning power as a digital nomad? [Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 Seconds—Free!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Digital Nomad Visa: A Modern Passport to Freedom

What is a Digital Nomad Visa? It’s the golden ticket for the laptop-wielding wanderer. A government-issued permission slip that says, “Yes, you can work here. No, you don’t have to sneak around.” It’s not just a visa. It’s a revolution in how—and where—you live.

Why the World Suddenly Cares. The pandemic cracked open the old office paradigm. Now, countries are fighting to attract remote workers. Sun, surf, and Wi-Fi? Yes, please. The digital nomad visa is the hottest passport stamp since the invention of the gap year.

*🌎 Curious about your nomad income ceiling? [Find out instantly—click here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Clock Starts: Application Submission

The First Click: Gathering Your Documents. The journey begins with a scavenger hunt. Passport? Check. Proof of income? Check. Health insurance, background check, and sometimes, a photo that doesn’t look like a mugshot. Every country has its own shopping list.

The Submission Abyss: Where Does Your Application Go? You upload. You email. You mail. Your paperwork vanishes into the bureaucratic ether. Sometimes you get a tracking number. Sometimes just a prayer. The clock ticks, but whose clock is it?

*🕒 Wondering if your skills can fund your travels? [Test your digital nomad income in 90 seconds—free tool!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Waiting Game: Official Processing Times

Average Processing Windows by Country. Some countries move at warp speed—think two weeks. Others? You’ll measure the wait in seasons. The range: 10 days to six months. It’s a lottery, and the jackpot is time.

Fast-Track Options: Myth or Reality? Some nations whisper about “expedited processing.” Sometimes it’s real. Sometimes it’s just a mirage—an extra fee for the privilege of waiting in a slightly shorter line.

#### Bureaucratic Black Holes: What Slows You Down?

Government Backlogs and Holidays. Your application might land during a national holiday. Or in a pile on a clerk’s desk. Bureaucracy is a beast that naps often and moves slowly. Expect the unexpected.

Missing Documents: The Silent Killer. One typo. One missing page. Your application stalls, and no one tells you. Weeks evaporate while your file gathers digital dust. Double-check everything, then check again.

*🌐 Want to know if your digital skills pay the bills? [Get your nomad income diagnosis—fast, free, no fluff!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Human Factor: How Your Profile Impacts Speed

Background Checks and Red Flags. Got a common name? Lived in five countries? Prepare for extra scrutiny. The more complex your backstory, the longer the background check.

Financial Proofs: Show Me the Money. Some countries want to see a steady income. Others want a fat bank account. If your finances are complicated, expect questions. And delays.

#### Country Showdown: Visa Timelines Compared

Europe’s Speed Demons vs. Island Time. Estonia and Portugal are the sprinters. The Caribbean? Sometimes they’re still sipping their morning coffee when your application arrives.

Asia’s Paper Trails and Surprises. Thailand, Indonesia—expect paperwork. Lots of it. But sometimes, a well-prepared file gets you through the labyrinth faster than you’d think.

*💡 Ready to unlock your nomad earning power? [Take the 90-second income test now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Secret Sauce: How to Accelerate Your Approval

Pro Tips for Lightning-Fast Processing. Submit everything in one go. Use official translations. Triple-check your scans. Attach a cover letter that makes you look irresistible.

The Power of Professional Help. Visa agents aren’t just for the lazy. They know the system. They know the loopholes. Sometimes, they know the guy who stamps the approvals.

#### Real-World Stories: The Good, the Bad, the Delayed

Tales of 48-Hour Miracles. Some nomads get approved before their coffee gets cold. Right paperwork, right timing, right country. It happens. Rare, but real.

Nightmares That Dragged for Months. Others wait. And wait. Lost documents, silent embassies, Kafkaesque email chains. The process can break the strongest spirits.

#### The Hidden Costs of Waiting

Lost Time, Lost Money. Every day you wait is a day you’re not earning, not exploring, not living the dream. The opportunity cost is real. Don’t let it sneak up on you.

Emotional Toll: Stress, Uncertainty, and FOMO. The waiting eats at you. Plans on hold. Tickets unbooked. The world keeps spinning, but you’re stuck in limbo.

#### What Happens After Approval?

The Welcome Letter: Next Steps. You get the email. Or the letter. Instructions follow. Sometimes you have 30 days to enter, sometimes 90. Read the fine print. Act fast.

Entry Deadlines and Activation Windows. Miss your window, and you’re back to square one. Some countries are strict. No exceptions. The clock is always ticking.

*🌍 Ready to see if your skills can take you global? [Check your nomad income potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### If You’re Denied: Next Moves

Appealing the Decision. Some countries let you appeal. Most don’t. If you’re rejected, the process is opaque. Try again, or try elsewhere.

Alternative Destinations or Visas. The world is wide. If one door slams shut, another opens. Sometimes a tourist visa or a business visa fills the gap.

#### The Future of Digital Nomad Visas

Tech Innovations in Application Processing. AI is creeping into the system. Automated checks, instant scans. The future could be frictionless. Or just faster red tape.

Predictions: Will It Get Faster? Governments are catching on. Competition is fierce. Expect streamlined processes, but don’t bet your ticket on it—yet.

#### Conclusion: The Race Against Bureaucracy

Is It Worth the Wait? For most, yes. The freedom, the adventure, the life less ordinary. But only if you’re ready to play the game—and beat the clock.

Your Next Step. Don’t just dream it. Plan it. Prepare. And, above all, act. The world’s waiting. Are you?",1,1749696091.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

And each of them trigger me so much in different ways! I feel like they deliberately try to drag me down into unhealthy habits.

The biggest culprit is my granny... a 5 foot nothing 70 year old, with diabetes. All she does is drink half a case of diet coke, smoke a 1.5 packs of ciggs, and look up ""Keto"" and sugar free recipes on her chromebook all day long!! All she every talks about is food! Showing me things! Saying how much she misses eating out.. and constantly asks what im making/cooking/eating and asks for a taste, she breaks her diet constantly by going out on ""shopping runs"" without planing lunch so she has an excuse to eat take out, then comes home with the leftovers and forces me to try it!! 
No matter what kind of diet I'm on or what boundaries I set she always inserts herself in the middle. 

And when I cook anything for dinner, it's either ""too healthy"", or she says we've had it too often and she's sick of it!! I can't do anything. 

When I try to make my lunch or breakfast she always buts in asking to try it! Or what im making! And if it's healthy, she'll literally audibly say ""yuck gross"" about it for no reason.
If my grandfather sees me cooking healthy, he'll also fake gag and laugh.

My family has big leftover culture too so I always make bigg suppers... but whenever me or my mom, take a portion that's ""little"" we'll always get a comment on us telling us to eat more. My grandmother has actually said, ""Oh well that's not enough you've barely had anything!"", even after I've eaten 3 slices of pizza. 
Not to mention always wanting us to try it with dip!! It ruins my eating experience being told the portion and  condiments I need to use, ON FOOD I MADE!!

And then after dinner, if there's something left they always say.. ""Oh, well its only a little salad with dressing! Just finish it! There's no point wrapping it up!"" 

And I'm just like WHAT TF in my head! I was full to begin with!! I'm trying to break my 'finish the plate mentality'! 



And my mom's bad too! She's on disability and doesn't work, all she does is watch anime, and bitch about shit, and about how she's gaining weight and looks so fat... (She looked like a model when I was a kid... and I've weighed more tgen her since I was 9). 
Meanwhile... the only two foods she fuckin eats are Ramen and nachos... barely any water and only coffee and tea... and stays up half the night smoking pot and snacking!





My grandmother gets offended when I don't want to watch TV for 3hours a night from 8pm-11pm. She mocks me when I say I'm going to bed early! 




How do I get better! How! It feels impossible! I'm always triggered, I feel like I have no privacy! And I eat in secret. I've been to two nutritionists in my teens! I just don't know what to do! 

I lost 40 pounds at 14... and gained 100 back in the past 5 years idk what to do. I need help. And I really feel like everyone just wants me to stay broken!",1,1749695797.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

I've recently joined your ranks, because one of my kids has special needs and I haven't been able to find any childcare arrangements that are tolerable for them. I've been off work before for maternity leaves, but honestly I barely remember those with all the sleep deprivation.

I'm a few months in now and... This. Is. Not. For. The. Weak. The combination of overstimulation and boredom, the endless chores, the utter dependency of these little beings. Don't get me wrong, there are moments of joy and contentment. But man do I miss being able to pee alone, hot coffee and quiet. Even on my most stressful work days, I felt competent. Now, I feel like I'm just using a broom to try to sweep river water back upstream.

Tl;Dr - so much respect for you all! It's a thankless but important job and I personally find it much harder than working out of the home!

Hey there - I'm a 22-year-old guy living in South Carolina, and honestly, I'm just looking for someone to genuinely connect with. Life can feel a bit isolating sometimes, and I'm ready to stop feeling like l'm on the outside looking in.

I'd say I'm pretty chill, thoughtful, and upfront. I value real conversations over small talk, whether it's late-night texts about random thoughts, deep chats about life, or just laughing over the dumbest memes. I'm open to grabbing coffee, going on walks, or simply getting to know each other at our own pace. no pressure, just real vibes.

I really appreciate kindness, curiosity, and a bit of humor. I'm not in a rush for anything specific. I'm more interested in something that feels meaningful, whatever form that takes.

""I'm ready to accept your terms and return as the heiress,"" I said into the phone before hanging up.



I turned to look around the bedroom I'd lived in for eight years. A sad smile tugged at my lips. Eight years of devotion, patience, and love-yet I had nothing to show for it.



""How dare you wear my mom's clothes!"" a shrill voice pierced the air behind me, yanking me from my thoughts.



I let out a soft sigh and turned to face Ivan, his little face twisted with anger. ""You're not even gonna say anything?"" he barked.



""Go back to your party, Ivan. Your friends are probably waiting,"" I said quietly.



""No!"" he shouted, grabbing the pitcher on the table and flinging its contents at me.

(i have some sort of blood sugar sensitivity, if i fast for more than ~8 hours i get very low blood sugar and pass out- haven’t seen a doctor about it because I’ve mostly managed it so far)

You are: preferably age 30+, close to Kezar stadium, available around lunchtime (like between 11-2pm), down to walk and talk and eat sandwiches
