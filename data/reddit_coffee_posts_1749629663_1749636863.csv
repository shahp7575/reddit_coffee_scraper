1l8oupn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8oupn,Would like to get some advice on how to use this space!,"Hello!   
First of all, thank you for taking the time to look at my post! I'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to interior design and I really don't have a good eye when it comes to shopping for things that will look good in my apartment, so that's why I'm here :)

Recently, I removed my desk that was standing against the wall which is pictured in the first image. It was a big dark gaming desk, with two screens and my computer, it took up the entirety of this wall (not in height, but still it must've been like 150cm tall). Nowadays, I don't spend as much time on my computer anymore so this space felt a little wasted. I gave my desk to a friend, but now I'm wondering how I could properly fill this space. 

I would ideally like a space where I could put my music gear (see second picture), along with maybe a desk where I could place a laptop or temporarily a desktop+screen when using it. I would like to use it as some kind of tinkerer's corner where I can work on hobby projects, make music etc. My first idea was just to buy a smaller desk (recommendations are much obliged!) and place it there, as I do really need some kind of a desk space, but I would just like to orientate some more before I buy something. 

I'm also missing some place where I can relax, drink some coffee or tea and read a book. Right now this is done either at the dinner table or on the couch. Some ""lounge"" corner maybe would be nice, although I know space is limited.

Some relevant dimensions: The wall is 245cm wide from the door frame to the end. The size from the end to the radiator is 175cm. The depth from the wall to the bookcase is 85cm.

I have added 2 extra pictures to give you an idea of how the rest of my room is designed, I really enjoy the warmth and coziness. 

Thank you so much! And if any more information is needed, don't hesitate to ask!

1l8ostu,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1l8ostu/when_coffee_came_with_cash_back/,When coffee came with cash back,"Something random has happened today. 

I stopped at Brown Bear’s for a cold coffee. I paid in cash, and the cashier owed me ₹15 in change. He had a ₹10 note but no ₹5 coin. He asked if I wanted anything else—I didn’t. After searching around and finding no change, he quietly pulled out another ₹10 note and handed it to me.
I was confused and told him I didn’t have change either. He just smiled and said, “It’s okay, madam. Take it. Not an issue.”

I’m generally a person that uses cash more than UPI. and don’t mind letting go of small amounts as tips. But in recent years, cash transactions have become frustrating—no one carries change anymore. I’ve had Ubers cancel on me for choosing cash over UPI. I had to let go off of a little change cause some didn’t have loose cash to give (although some offered to pay me back through UPI, id be like, its fine. Just keep it.). Since then, I’ve been determined to take every rupee back. 

Even today, I refused to buy anything extra—I just wanted my cold coffee and the ₹15. When he gave me ₹20 instead, I froze. Should I take it? Should I leave the ₹10? It was just ₹5, but still. 
Finally, I took the 20 and told him I’d pay him back next time. He smiled again: “It’s okay, madam. Don’t think about it. Enjoy the coffee.” 

So there I was, walking out with my coffee and ₹20, trying to process what just happened. The cashier gave the customer extra money cause he didn’t have the change. Dude pulled a uno reverse, lol. How often does this happen ?

1l8oots,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1l8oots/i_posted_about_healing_my_sibo_with_herbs_heres/,I posted about healing my SIBO with herbs - here’s my 1 week later update,"Hi everyone,

Some of you might remember my post about starting a herbal protocol to treat what I suspect is SIBO. I won’t link the original post here since it was flagged as looking like an ad—but I wanted to follow up because many people asked for an update.

It’s been exactly one week since I started taking the herbs. I chose them based on clinical studies showing efficacy for SIBO. I’ve ruled out other conditions through comprehensive bloodwork, ultrasound, stool test, gastro consult (where they stick a camera down your stomach) and a pending SIBO breath test. While I don’t have the SIBO results back yet, my symptoms and all other negative test results strongly point in that direction. I also now suspect that it could have also been Parasites, since my current herbs are actually made to clear those out too. I recommend others to consider this too. 

Before the herbs, my diet was severely restricted—literally just canned corn, plain boiled chicken, unseasoned white rice, and distilled water. That’s all I could tolerate without pain.

Now… that’s all gone out the window.
Here’s a snapshot of what I’ve eaten this past week (off the top of my head):

• 2 Oreo McFlurries

• A footlong Subway sandwich

• Cheese chips

• A banh mi

• Bacon, egg & sausage English muffin

• Fries 

• 3 Oreo ice cream bars

• 3 Bagel with cream cheese 

No bloating. No pain. I feel normal for the first time in years.

After each meal, I take a dose of the herbs. From what I’ve read, this approach is sometimes called “bait and kill”—you feed the bacteria so they come out of hiding, then hit them with antimicrobials. I’ve been doing that diligently.

Symptom rating: 0.2 / 10

There’s still some psychological residue—my stomach remembers the trauma—but I don’t go into flare states anymore. At worst, I might feel a bit gassy, but it passes. I haven’t had to cancel a single day, which is a huge deal for me. I also am drinking tons of coconut water, which for me helps me pass stools. It’s important to poo daily, and push all the dead bacteria debris out of your system. 

Yes, my current diet isn’t ideal. But please understand: I was in food prison for two years. Even a “bad” diet now feels like celebration. That freedom is part of my healing, too.

I’m still avoiding alcohol, coffee, soda, and spicy food to play it safe.

After this “kill phase,” I plan to move into a rebuilding phase—introducing probiotics and gut lining repair supplements.

All in all, I’d say I’m doing absolutely amazing, and slowly trusting food again. 

I’ll post another update soon—maybe in a week or two.

I had a heartbreak in my highschool pretty much after that I lost interest in any romantic relationship. I did get few attentions and interest from girls which I straight away avoided feeling they had a romantic interest. Later I wanted to be in a platonic friendship with  some girls who came in my circle but I believe they had different intentions and later they either ghosted me or just wasn't bringing the same vibe. Out of all this me turning 25 and some interactions with my friends made me realize how single and virgin I am. Some times my highschool buddies don't believe I still haven't been in a relationship or that I'm a virgin, given how they know me.

I hope all this give an idea about me.

So now straight to the point:

I just got randomly encountered by an girl who I thought was gonna ask for some directions but she just gave casual talk like she likes my look and who I am and then just gave her number for a coffee or something.I liked her casual cold approach and was absolutely interested for a date with her and see how it goes so I texted her through regular message once I reached home but didn't get a reply or anything so far.

While bored and waiting for a reply, I did a quick social media deep dive (don't judge). Turns out, she lied about her age - said she was 26 but she's more like 28-29. Honestly, I kinda felt it in the moment, with her little mischievous smile and pause when she said ""around 26."" I'm not actually bothered by her age or the lie itself; it felt more like she was uncomfortable with her real age. I'm just a bit lost on how to play this or what to even look for down the line.

Also, I need advice on how to let her know I'm not looking for anything serious but I am interested in something casual/carnal. And by ""carnal,"" I don't mean demanding sex - I'm cool if things don't get physical at all - just definitely nothing serious.

She was my rock, I flew cross continents to be there for her during her wedding. And help with everything. I visit her once a year in her country (my home country). And we only became this close after starting work together. She has always been amazing to me and has always wanted to help people. 

So I confronted her, she instantly turned it on me, how I can't take a joke, how she thought I knew her better, and then apologized publicly... In the work group

I wasn't angry, I handled it well initially. But her reaction was quite extreme and left me disappointed. Like someone getting caught and instantly trying to deflect. 

Our job takes screenshots (yes, that's a culture issue) and I realized, she might go to clean up the mess and pretend it never happened. So I go online and check the screenshots, she went and revoked my access to the recording and rallied her teammates to cover for her and say it's deleted because storage was full. 

She then lied about it when I asked about the recording - but she doesn't realize I saw everything. 

But the following Monday, the auditors sent me a message after the weekend saying she was busy with non work related things during the last three weeks - applying for jobs, building a business plan, inviting her friends to Google meets for hangouts. For up to 20 hours a week. 

And I asked her about it as her manager, she instantly lied. 
Saying it's work related. Market research. We are not in any department that does market research by applying for jobs and having coffee with friends.

And then she asked me to lie to the auditors on her behalf. And expected me to. Because I'm her friend.

And that's when I realized I can't do this anymore. This was disrespectful, and if that one recording I accidentally stumbled upon, how many more were there? 

I tried to bring it up to her that I'm disappointed in all of this and having trouble with trusting her but of course I got deflection at full speed and just a massive set of essays how if I'm not trusting her the problem is me and I need to do some self reflection. 

She even tried to throw another colleague under the bus to save her butt. A person she called a friend as well. 

So I don't really know how to navigate this

- First work wise, HR says it's my choice whether I want to fire her or give her a written warning instead. 

The gross misconduct I've seen would get anyone fired at our company, but I always give people a second chance... The problem is the lying. She doesn't realize I've seen so many lies and she trickle truths me when she realizes I know a small detail...

- Personal life wise, do I just slow fade? I've tried talking. She just brings up trauma after trauma and says she's hurt. 

I feel like, as a friend, you should be able to talk openly and honestly, but it just hasn't worked before.. ",7,1749634974.0,AskWomenOver30,12,1.0,False

That delicate gold ring you wear every day? Or that bold pair of hoops you never leave home without? They’re saying something, even if you’re not. Our [**Everyday Fine Jewelry**](https://www.samayajewelry.com/collections/fine-jewelry-1) often reflects more than just our style—it tells a story about who we are, what we value, and how we want to show up in the world.

Let’s decode what your jewelry choices might be saying about you. Whether you lean classic, artsy, romantic, or rebellious—there’s meaning in every piece.



# 1. Why Your Everyday Jewelry Actually Matters

Before we get into the fun stuff, let’s pause for a second. Everyday jewelry is *different* from what you wear to weddings or fancy events. These are the pieces that become part of your daily rhythm—the ones you slip on for coffee runs, work meetings, or weekend brunch. They’re often sentimental: maybe a gift from someone special, a milestone marker, or something that just feels *so you*.

Unlike statement pieces that shout, everyday jewelry whispers. And those whispers? They speak volumes about your style, your story, and your spirit.

# 2. The Classic Minimalist: Timeless & Effortlessly Chic

If your jewelry drawer is full of sleek gold hoops, dainty diamond studs, or thin chain necklaces, you’re all about understated elegance. You love quality over quantity and believe in timeless over trendy.

**Your vibe says:** 🖤 “I don’t need to try too hard.” 🖤 “Simple is powerful.” 🖤 “I love the classics—with a twist.”

You’re drawn to neutral tones, crisp tailoring, and brands like Tiffany & Co. or Mejuri. Minimalist, yes—but never boring.

# 3. The Trendsetter: Bold, Daring & Always Ahead

Your jewelry rotates with the seasons. One day it's chunky gold chains, the next it's mismatched [**Diamonds Earrings**](https://www.samayajewelry.com/collections/earrings) or sculptural rings. You don’t just follow trends—you set them.

**Your jewelry says:** 💥 “Notice me.” 💥 “Fashion is my playground.” 💥 “I don’t play it safe.”

You shop capsule drops, discover new designers on Instagram, and live for the next *it* piece.

# 4. The Romantic: Soft, Sentimental & Dreamy

Are hearts, pearls, florals, and rose gold your thing? Then chances are you’re a sentimental soul who sees [**Fine Jewelry**](https://www.samayajewelry.com/collections/fine-jewelry-1) as more than just adornment—it’s a love letter.

**You’re saying:** 💖 “I wear my heart on my sleeve.” 💖 “Every detail matters.” 💖 “Memories are everything.”

You love lockets, vintage-inspired designs, and anything that feels like a keepsake. Your jewelry is emotional, delicate, and filled with meaning.

# 5. The Power Dresser: Polished, Strong & Sophisticated

You mean business—and your jewelry does too. Think bold cuffs, sleek chokers, and geometric earrings. You love pieces with clean lines and structure.

**Your jewelry says:** 💼 “I’m here to make an impact.” 💼 “Details define the look.” 💼 “Confidence is my signature.”

Your wardrobe leans tailored and sharp, and your jewelry mirrors that with a modern edge.

# 6. The Sentimentalist: Personal, Symbolic & Heartfelt

Is your [**Everyday Necklace**](https://www.samayajewelry.com/collections/necklaces) engraved with initials? Do you wear a ring that marks a life event? You’re a sentimentalist through and through. It’s not about trends—it’s about connection.

**Your style says:** 📿 “This piece *means* something.” 📿 “I carry memories with me.” 📿 “Value goes beyond price tags.”

You love personal touches—birthstones, heirlooms, or custom designs. It’s the emotion behind the piece that matters most.



# 7. The Artistic Soul: Creative, Expressive & Unconventional

Your [**Everyday Fine Jewelry**](https://www.samayajewelry.com/collections/fine-jewelry-1) is anything but typical. You love abstract forms, indie designers, and pieces that make people pause and ask, “Where did you get that?”

**Your jewelry says:** 🎨 “Jewelry is my art form.” 🎨 “I don’t follow rules—I make them.” 🎨 “Originality is everything.”

You probably mix metals, textures, and eras. Your style is authentic, imaginative, and impossible to replicate.

# 8. The Luxe Lover: Glamorous, Confident & High-End

You’re all about that sparkle. Diamonds? Yes. Designer watches? Definitely. Statement earrings? Always. You know what you love—and it’s luxury.

**You’re saying:** 💎 “I don’t settle—I select.” 💎 “I’ve earned this.” 💎 “Luxury is my lifestyle.”

From Van Cleef to Chanel, your pieces are curated, polished, and unapologetically glamorous.

# 9. The Subtle Rebel: Cool, Quiet & Unexpected

You don’t scream for attention—but take a second look and there’s always something unexpected: a black diamond, an edgy stud, or a reverse-worn chain.

**Your jewelry says:** 🖤 “I color outside the lines.” 🖤 “Understated doesn’t mean unnoticed.” 🖤 “I love a good twist.”

You lean minimalist, but with attitude. It’s all in the details—and you *always* keep people guessing.

# 10. Not Sure Which One You Are?

You don’t have to fit into one box. Most of us are a mix!

Ask yourself: ✨ What jewelry do I wear the most? ✨ What brands or aesthetics am I drawn to? ✨ How does my jewelry make me *feel*?

Maybe you're a Classic at work, but a Boho on weekends. Maybe you love the emotion of a Sentimentalist *and* the boldness of a Power Dresser. There’s no wrong answer—just what feels true to you.

# 11. Building a Jewelry Collection That’s So You

Once you know your style personality (or personalities!), it’s easier to build a collection you love. Here’s how:

* Invest in a few high-quality core pieces you’ll always wear.  
* Add in statement or seasonal items to play and experiment.  
* Choose materials that last—like gold, platinum, and natural gemstones.  
* Support designers and brands that reflect your values.  
* Rotate your collection with intention, not just habit.  

# Final Thoughts: Let Your Jewelry Do the Talking

Your [**Everyday Fine Jewelry**](https://www.samayajewelry.com/collections/fine-jewelry-1) isn’t random—it’s your quiet signature. Whether it’s bold, dainty, vintage, or ultra-modern, it tells the world something about *you*. So next time you reach for that favorite ring or necklace, pause and ask yourself: *What am I saying today?*

Because in the end, you are your best accessory.And your jewelry? It’s the perfect exclamation point.",1,1749634907.0,u_Expensive_Self_1359,0,1.0,False

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

We ended up talking and I think a couple days later her step sister got around to talking to madysen and madysen unblocked me and was happy to know I still cared about her and was all like ""so i heard you were asking about me"". A VERY VERY important detail about this was right after she blocked me her dad had died and madysen called me saying she didn't know what to do and she was just driving around, I didn't do the best job of comforting her, all I said was i was sorry and she could come over which she didn't. But her step sister ended up talking to her and I felt awful for her at work, really made me sad thinking about what happened. Also a couple days before I got blocked and her dad died, Madysen was with me and we called him on the phone something he said to me was ""Hope your taking good care of her"", which to this day I never forgot and still think about I think this was back in February or march. Madysen ended up messaging me and admitting she wore my sweatshirt because she missed me and it smelled like me, which was adorable. She did this week without hanging out thing again than I called her and basically set strong boundaries with her saying she needed to try harder and not let petty excuses get in the way of us seeing eachother and I got her to admit she cared and so she genuinely tried the next week and it worked but she slowly fell back into the same habit because I gave up and didn't reinforce what I had said. Every time we hung out was past 1 am and we just fell asleep together because I worked night shifts and that was when I was free. I really didn't like this.

**Things went really south**

At a certain point we hadn't hung out for two weeks and i met up with her and went to a movie with her and afterwards had her meet me back at my apartment so i could give her a necklace, she had told me she was sick and I said I didn't care (90% she was lying) we hung out everything was ok she looked a little off but was happy after I gave her the necklace and stuff. The next couple of days were really weird. She ended up messaging and tell me she didn't want to be together and I was a rebound for some other guy she was into but never hung out with in person and bla bla bla than I retaliated and explained my view on our relationship and wasn't going to give up, she went along with it and conceded essentially. I told her to give me a list of everything she wanted in a man and she already had one coincidently and I made a doc and spent like four hours explaining what kind of man i was under each category and I sent it to her later that night. I was showing I could do it and commit.

She looked at it didn't say anything for a day than I did a follow up and she was all mad I took a day to double text, I think that night she drank a bunch and messaged me throughout the entire night going over relationship questions like bounderies and what we liked about eachother and she admitted she really liked me and had to act like she didn't or something and was liked ""oops i wasn't supposed to say that"" I think she deleted it later.

The next couple of days were even weirder I think she ended up doing the same thing saying she didn't think we should date but then agreed to work things out and sent me a relationship post the next day blabla bla than a couple days later she didn't respond to me at all and I got all needy messaging her over and over and she blocked me. I found out through her step sister she had met up with the guy she had been into they made out and stuff and he gave her hickies. Madysen sent pictures to the group chat with her step sister and her step sister said ""ouu is that from Ethan"" she responded and said ""No from jacob"" I had messaged her step sister to find out what happened and she told me everything. Madysen had left one channel of communication open on tiktok and so I messaged her acting as if I didn't know at first and she tried playing off the end of our relationship like she didn't care about me anymore and said ""theres no way your this obsessed"" keep in mind we'd been together a couple months. I gave it a bit and wasn't gonna say anything about her cheating because I didn't want her to know I spoke to her stepsister but I started progressively getting more and more upset with myself and her and spent the night writing a long ass paragraph calling her out. I sent it and she tried defending herself and justifying what she did and nitpicking me, I didn't believe in any of the nitpicking obviously. She blocked me long story short and I spent the next month listening to relationship audiobooks and learning to get her back, I ended up becoming good friends with her step sister and we hung out and talked about her a bunch. I didn't know how but in my head I was gonna get her back.

I put my tiktok on private and Madysen had kept viewing my profile, eventually i went public and she unblocked me completely. I didn't try and talk to her for the rest of the month and was about to give up thinking about her than her aunt somehow had my number and messaged me saying madysen talked about me a lot and felt aweful about what happened and was upset all the time and guilty like always. I chose to reach out to her because I stopped viewing her as a monster after this, obviously what happened was the guy she got with blocked her for the second time he was some marine. I talked to madysen off and on for the last month it was very slow and tedious getting her to build comfort.

**We hangout again**

We eventually hung out again and she was super awkward and quiet, we went on a hike and I got her to come back to my apartment she didn't want to, She wanted to go hangout downtown I agreed but got her to come in first and park at my apartment. She agreed but we never went down town. I spent like two hours making her smile and telling her to stop being awkward and she was laughing so much and when she tried leaving I wouldn't let her and she loved it and i tickled her and stuff but eventually I let her go. She said she’d call me that night and we could hangout soon possibly the next day. She sent me a message and got my number back from me and i responded than she never texted me back that night….”ummm ok”. The next day I waited no response, I messaged and said maybe I’ll just hangout with one of my other girlfriends tonight (yawning emoji). Her response was ok have fun be safe and she was all passive aggressive with me and I said I’ll just give you space, I was only joking with her even though unfortunately there was some truth to it which I felt bad about, it was only because I was trying not to give her all my energy. 

**Weird communication**

It was weird talking to her after this for like a month but I sent a reel that said you have a beautiful smile and she called me the next morning for a sec and showed me she dyed her hair. She agreed to call later and I tried and no answer and then no response. I tried planning to hangout with her on a specific day and she said it depends on what time and she kind of talked to me like we were gonna ended being like around 8 work? And she talked to me like she was going to than ended up saying she was at a party. I had put off hanging out with a different girl that day for her and it through me off for good with that other girl so I set a mini boundary with her and told her she should have let me know what she was doing. She opened and no response (meaning she was anxious trust me i know her). A couple days later messaged and said “Hey you're welcome to come over tuesday just let me know ahead of time. NO RESPONSE for two days but she read it. Guess what I was thinking to myself there's no way she doesn’t message me before then and it was the night before tuesday when I was driving home i was having this thought and I intentionally left my phone at home while at work as I usually do. I got home and she spam called me four times and sent and unsent a message than added my snap back. I messaged and said “are you up still? No response but i saw she was active on tiktok. I was on tiktok looking for a reel to send her for a while and she kept going off and on and I found one, I was trying to reassure her and make things not weird so I sent a reel that said “im not sure what the future holds but I want to figure it out with you” she immediately opened tiktok back up and blocked me also after I sent my message I forgot to mention she unadded my snap friend request which i was gonna accept in the morning so i didn’t seem needy. I’ve been blocked for over a week on everything, phone and imessage also. I messaged her aunt asking if I could call her and explain what happened and maybe she could talk to madysen and her aunt agreed sounding concerned for us but the next day her aunt never responded again its been a week that was like tuesday the day after the block. I even tried calling the aunt and it said “caller is not available right now” so obviously madysen talked to her. 

**My behavior over the last week**

I’ve been extremely reckless and my buddy drove to the ocean which is three hours away after I spent the whole day driving for hours with my other friend whos a girl. We drove to the ocean and drank. He was drinking and driving but hes good at it and has a high tolerance although I know thats still dangerous. I drank and I never drink I felt pretty optimistic about talking to the aunt the next day. We stayed up all through the night and this indian dude tried to call the cops on us for drinking at night and driving. We got back and the aunt never responded on day 3 of being blocked. I went to the strip club a couple days later and drank with my friend and we argued at night, I’ve been hella overspending, I’ve felt awful everyday and unmotivated even though I would focus on other stuff before being blocked. I’ve been trying to message and call her step sister but she’s been hella distracted and even just so happened to go to a cabin for a couple days normally Im able to talk to her and call, she agreed to twice in one day but then didn’t answer and still hasn’t gotten back to me since yesterday. I even told her im anxious. I’ve genuinely been so anxious guys I learned I'm a lot more attached to this girl emotionally than I thought I even drank two and a half glasses of wine last night with my friends on the phone and got super drunk but the buzz was horrible mostly. Also like I said I don’t drink.

**Moving forward?**

Guys in my head I love this girl and my anxiety has been so I high I wanted to date her again so I could set firmer boundaries and make the relationship work this time after listening to audio books on women and understanding what I was doing wrong before, I never got to that point and like I said im super anxious and just wondering if shes gonna come back again or what I did wrong or why she blocked me again. I really care about her and I know she cared about me otherwise she wouldn’t have done this. Will she come back likely? Also keep in mind this is my longest anything with a girl before this my longest was like a month max. Also guys I know your all gonna be like move on but the truth is I wouldn’t have committed so much time and energy into this girl if thats truly what I wanted and I get no benefit from giving up especially if I don’t fully know why she blocked me. Can you guys give me some decent advice to help me stop being anxious but still keep the door open with her. I haven’t had that call with her step sister sense right after madysen blocked me which i forgot to mention but i’ve been trying to talk to her again and asked if we could hangout soon, i'm waiting for her to get back.And yes im obsessed with her but only because I really care about her. I tried also leaving her a voicemail explaining everything even though i was blocked it let me not sure if it went through though. Is there hope guys? Also I’d rather suffer trying than give up and be back where I started.

She opened and no response (meaning she was anxious trust me i know her). A couple days later messaged and said “Hey you're welcome to come over tuesday just let me know ahead of time. NO RESPONSE for two days but she read it. Guess what I was thinking to myself there's no way she doesn’t message me before then and it was the night before tuesday when I was driving home i was having this thought and I intentionally left my phone at home while at work as I usually do. I got home and she spam called me four times and sent and unsent a message than added my snap back. I messaged and said “are you up still? No response but i saw she was active on tiktok. I was on tiktok looking for a reel to send her for a while and she kept going off and on and I found one, I was trying to reassure her and make things not weird so I sent a reel that said “im not sure what the future holds but I want to figure it out with you” she immediately opened tiktok back up and blocked me also after I sent my message I forgot to mention she unadded my snap friend request which i was gonna accept in the morning so i didn’t seem needy. I’ve been blocked for over a week on everything, phone and imessage also. I messaged her aunt asking if I could call her and explain what happened and maybe she could talk to madysen and her aunt agreed sounding concerned for us but the next day her aunt never responded again its been a week that was like tuesday the day after the block. I even tried calling the aunt and it said “caller is not available right now” so obviously madysen talked to her. 

**My behavior over the last week**

I’ve been extremely reckless and my buddy drove to the ocean which is three hours away after I spent the whole day driving for hours with my other friend whos a girl. We drove to the ocean and drank. He was drinking and driving but hes good at it and has a high tolerance although I know thats still dangerous. I drank and I never drink I felt pretty optimistic about talking to the aunt the next day. We stayed up all through the night and this indian dude tried to call the cops on us for drinking at night and driving. We got back and the aunt never responded on day 3 of being blocked. I went to the strip club a couple days later and drank with my friend and we argued at night, I’ve been hella overspending, I’ve felt awful everyday and unmotivated even though I would focus on other stuff before being blocked. I’ve been trying to message and call her step sister but she’s been hella distracted and even just so happened to go to a cabin for a couple days normally Im able to talk to her and call, she agreed to twice in one day but then didn’t answer and still hasn’t gotten back to me since yesterday. I even told her im anxious. I’ve genuinely been so anxious guys I learned I'm a lot more attached to this girl emotionally than I thought I even drank two and a half glasses of wine last night with my friends on the phone and got super drunk but the buzz was horrible mostly. Also like I said I don’t drink.

**Moving forward?**

Guys in my head I love this girl and my anxiety has been so I high I wanted to date her again so I could set firmer boundaries and make the relationship work this time after listening to audio books on women and understanding what I was doing wrong before, I never got to that point and like I said im super anxious and just wondering if shes gonna come back again or what I did wrong or why she blocked me again. I really care about her and I know she cared about me otherwise she wouldn’t have done this. Will she come back likely? Also keep in mind this is my longest anything with a girl before this my longest was like a month max. Also guys I know your all gonna be like move on but the truth is I wouldn’t have committed so much time and energy into this girl if thats truly what I wanted and I get no benefit from giving up especially if I don’t fully know why she blocked me. Can you guys give me some decent advice to help me stop being anxious but still keep the door open with her. I haven’t had that call with her step sister sense right after madysen blocked me which i forgot to mention but i’ve been trying to talk to her again and asked if we could hangout soon, i'm waiting for her to get back.And yes im obsessed with her but only because I really care about her. I tried also leaving her a voicemail explaining everything even though i was blocked it let me not sure if it went through though. Is there hope guys? Also I’d rather suffer trying than give up and be back where I started.

## Key Features Analysis

The Corn Organic Isomalto Oligosaccharide Powder boasts a range of features that contribute to its effectiveness and versatility.

**Organic Certification:** This powder is certified organic, meaning it is produced according to strict organic farming standards.

This ensures that the corn used in its production is grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. This certification guarantees a higher level of purity and safety, appealing to consumers who prioritize natural and sustainable food choices. The organic certification process also involves rigorous audits and inspections to maintain compliance with established standards.

**Prebiotic Fiber Content:** It is a rich source of prebiotic fiber, which nourishes beneficial bacteria in the gut.

Prebiotic fibers are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria in the colon. This contributes to a healthier gut microbiome, which is essential for optimal digestion, immune function, and overall well-being. The IMO powder typically contains a high percentage of prebiotic fibers, making it an effective supplement for improving gut health.

**Low Glycemic Index (GI):** The powder has a low glycemic index compared to sucrose and other common sweeteners.

This means it causes a slower and more gradual rise in blood sugar levels after consumption, making it a suitable option for individuals with diabetes or those looking to manage their blood sugar. The low GI of IMO powder helps to avoid the rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar that can lead to energy fluctuations and other health problems. Studies have shown that IMO can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control.

**Mild Sweetness:** It offers a mild and pleasant sweetness that is less intense than that of sugar or artificial sweeteners.

This makes it a versatile ingredient for various applications, as it can enhance the flavor of foods and beverages without overpowering them. The mild sweetness of IMO powder also makes it a good choice for individuals who are sensitive to strong sweeteners or who prefer a more subtle flavor profile. It can be used in baking, cooking, and as a natural sweetener for coffee, tea, and other beverages.

**High Solubility:** The powder dissolves easily in water and other liquids, making it easy to incorporate into various recipes and formulations.

This excellent solubility ensures that it can be smoothly integrated into beverages, smoothies, baked goods, and other food products without clumping or leaving a gritty texture. The ease of dissolution also facilitates its use in industrial applications, such as in the production of functional foods and dietary supplements.

**Heat Stability:** It is stable under high-temperature conditions, making it suitable for use in baking and cooking applications.

This heat stability ensures that its sweetness and prebiotic properties are not compromised during the cooking process. This makes it a reliable ingredient for a wide range of recipes, including cakes, cookies, breads, and other baked goods.

## Core Benefits

The Corn Organic Isomalto Oligosaccharide Powder provides several key benefits that make it a valuable addition to a healthy diet.

**Improved Gut Health:** The prebiotic fiber content of the powder promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, leading to a healthier gut microbiome. This can improve digestion, reduce bloating, and enhance nutrient absorption. A healthy gut microbiome is also linked to a stronger immune system and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

**Blood Sugar Management:** The low glycemic index of the powder helps to regulate blood sugar levels, making it a suitable sweetener for individuals with diabetes or those looking to manage their blood sugar. By preventing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar, IMO powder can help to maintain stable energy levels throughout the day.

**Enhanced Digestive Comfort:** By promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and improving gut health, the powder can help to reduce digestive discomfort, such as bloating, gas, and constipation. A healthy gut microbiome is essential for proper digestion and the efficient breakdown of food.

**Weight Management Support:** The prebiotic fiber in the powder can contribute to feelings of fullness and satiety, which can help to reduce overall calorie intake and support weight management efforts. Fiber slows down the digestion process, leading to a more sustained release of energy and reduced cravings.

**Versatile Sweetening Option:** The mild sweetness and high solubility of the powder make it a versatile ingredient that can be used in a wide range of applications, from baking and cooking to sweetening beverages and smoothies. It offers a natural and healthy alternative to traditional sugars and artificial sweeteners.

Third Person's POV

""Ma'am, your husband has cheated on you. The divorce agreement in your hand is real, and there is no agreed time for remarriage. As long as you file it, you can actually complete the divorce process. If you don't want a divorce, I can help you revoke this document.""

""No, just file it for me. When can the divorce process be completed?""

""Three days later.""

Clarissa sat in a cafe with the lawyer, recalling what happened yesterday.

“Mrs. Daniel, your husband’s frozen sperm, stored here at the hospital, was taken five years ago. It was donated to Ms. Gabrielle Hawkins. Didn’t he tell you?”

Clarissa Daniel’s smile froze the second she heard that name. For a moment, she thought she’d misheard and asked again in an unsteady voice, “Is it possible there was a mistake? My husband’s name is Norris Daniel.”

The doctor tapped the keyboard a few more times, double-checking. Then he looked up and said firmly, “There’s no mistake. I can still remember, when Ms. Hawkins gave birth, Mr. Daniel even sent a thank-you banner to the hospital.”

The words hit her like a blow. Her hand, resting on the wheelchair arm, slipped off, powerless, then a buzzing filled her ears.

Five years ago, she and Norris got married.

Back then, he’d told her he didn’t want her to suffer through childbirth, and had volunteered to get a vasectomy. She’d been so touched by his thoughtfulness back then.

Still, fearing he might regret it one day, she insisted he freeze some sperm first, just in case.

Lately, He was under great pressure from his parents. In order to help him share the pain, she also wanted to have a child of their [own.So](http://own.So), she came to the hospital on her own, planning to surprise him with a pregnancy.

But instead, he’d surprised her first.

And the name Gabrielle chilled her to the bone.

Gabrielle was the older girl from next door, whom Norris had secretly loved for fifteen years. He’d planned a grand confession before she went overseas, only to be flat-out rejected.

It was during that heartbreak that Clarissa stayed by his side, warming him with her sunny optimism. Eventually, they got married.

She truly believed he’d moved on, that he’d fallen in love with her.

Now she realized he never had. He never let go of Gabrielle. Clarissa was just the consolation prize in a sad little game she played with herself.

The doctor noticed the sudden change in her complexion and asked a few concerned questions.

Clarissa forced a smile. “I’m fine,” she murmured, wheeling herself out of the hospital and heading home.

Still in a daze, she pushed the door open, assuming the place was empty, until the faint clinking of glasses reached her from the balcony.

“Norris, are you really going through with the divorce? Clarissa’s been with you for five years. Don’t you love her even a little?”

Norris’s voice was lazy, almost indifferent as he replied, “When Gabrielle needed me to get married for the sake of her stability, I agreed. But now she doesn’t need that anymore. And I don’t want to keep Clarissa tied to me out of guilt. That’s the only reason I married her in the first place.”

The voice on the balcony paused, then asked again, more seriously, “Does Clarissa know you and Gabrielle have a child together? She loves you so much. If you really divorce her, I bet she’ll disappear without a trace. You’ll never find her again.”

Norris chuckled. “She doesn’t need to know about the kid. A few days ago, I told her the company’s in trouble and that we needed to fake a divorce. Once she gets used to the idea, I’ll tell her the truth. She’ll understand. Besides, look at her legs. Where can she even go?”

Clarissa felt like her brain had exploded.

'A fake divorce?' The words echoed in her head.

She had believed him, believed the crisis was real. She even gave him the last of her dowry savings to help him through it.

But it was all a lie.

A choked sob rose in her throat, and her chest tightened as if pierced by needles.

She had been planning a future with him, thinking about surprising him on their anniversary.

But he had already erased her from his plans. Guilt was all it took to sum up her ten-year crush and five-year marriage.

She thought she had finally won his heart. Turned out, she was just a placeholder in his love story with someone else.

Looking down at her lifeless legs and remembering the pain she endured to save him, she realized how foolish she’d been.

Instantly, grief turned into rage.

Clarissa suddenly started pounding her legs with her fists, tears splashing onto her thighs, hot and unstoppable.

Suddenly, the voices on the balcony fell silent.

Clarissa froze. She hadn’t meant for them to hear. Panicking, she turned the wheelchair and headed for the front door.

A moment later, Norris came over. His expression flickered with surprise, and his voice dripped with false concern.

“Clarissa, when did you get back? You should’ve called, I’d have come to get you. What did the doctor say?”

She looked at his eyes full of love, but then her eyes welled up again.

Alarmed, Norris reached out, trying to wipe away her tears. “What’s wrong? It’s okay. If you don’t get better, I’ll take care of you forever.”

Clarissa stared into his eyes again, trying to find even a shred of real affection in his eyes. But in the end, she couldn’t bear to know and looked away.

Sniffling softly, she casually asked, “Norris, I’ve been thinking… I’d really like to have a child with you. It’s a good thing we froze some sperm back then. Do you think you can come with me to the hospital sometime soon?”

Upon hearing that, his face changed instantly. He avoided eye contact and mumbled something, clearly trying to change the subject.

“Why bring that up all of a sudden? I don’t want you to suffer through pregnancy. I’d feel awful. Besides, didn’t we agree to travel the world together? Hard to do that with a baby.”

Seeing how uncomfortable he looked, Clarissa closed her eyes. She had her answer.

She slumped slightly in her chair and said, “I’m tired. Can you carry me to the bedroom?”

He nodded and helped her inside. Once he was gone, Clarissa reached for her phone.

“Auntie,” she said quietly, “I’ve made up my mind. I want to go to the Netherlands with you.”

Her aunt's excited voice came through the speaker, but the joy didn’t last long.

“This time… how long are you planning to stay? Don’t tell me you’ll come running back after two days because you miss your husband again.”

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She whispered, “Permanently.”

There was a pause on the other end. Then her aunt’s voice came back, warm and full of resolve. “Okay, then. I’ll start the immigration paperwork.”

After hanging up, Clarissa made another call. But at that time, to her lawyer.

She was done waiting.

Her love couldn’t warm a heart that never opened to her. If Norris wanted a real divorce, then she’d give him exactly what he wanted.

She would turn this fake divorce into a real one and make his lies come true.

End of memories.

Once Clarissa made up her mind to leave Norris for good, she didn’t waste any time. Ahe met with a lawyer to sort through their shared assets and financials.

By the time she was ready to head home, a sudden downpour had started. However, she hadn’t brought a driver today and had just hailed a cab to the quiet little coffee shop where she met her lawyer. Now, with the heavy rain coming down in sheets and barely a car in sight, Clarissa found herself stuck.

She’d wait under the awning for the rain to pass and kindly refused her offer to help.

Hours passed, but the rain didn’t let up. It only grew heavier as the sky turned from gray to pitch-black. As such, her legs, still recovering, began to ache. With no other option, she finally pulled out her phone and called him.

“Norris,” she said softly, “can you come pick me up?”

The urgency in his voice was immediate. He barely got out a few words before hanging up, promising he was on his way.

That call sparked a small warmth in her chest.

Maybe he still cared. Maybe not everything between them was a lie. Could she give him one last chance?

But just as he turned the corner from his street, Norris’s phone buzzed with a message that froze him in place.

\[Gabrielle: Norris, I’m back.\]

His heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he pulled over, sent a quick message to his driver, and spun the car around. The tires screeched as he sped off, heading straight for the airport.

Back in the rain, Clarissa sat in her wheelchair, rehearsing in her mind what she would say to him. She’d tell him about her fears, her confusion, the aching need to believe they could still make this work.

But night fell, the storm quieted to a drizzle, and rain pooled around the base of her wheels, yet Norris never came.

Her heart sank deeper and deeper, until it felt like it had hit rock bottom.

She called him again, but there was no answer. Still, she tried again, and finally, someone picked up. But it wasn’t him.

A woman’s voice, soft, almost pleading, echoed from the other end.

“Norris, do you really not love me anymore?”

After a brief silence came Norris’s voice, low and tight with emotion.

“Gabrielle... I’m married now.”

The woman didn’t back down and asked, “But you still came for me, didn’t you? Then tell me, why would you leave your wife, who’s only five kilometers away, just to drive thirty kilometers to pick me up?”

Clarissa’s whole body went still.

She opened her mouth, tried to speak, but no sound came. Her throat burned, words trapped behind pain.

At that moment, panic set in. She wanted to hang up, to stop hearing this, but her trembling hand accidentally hit the speaker button instead.

Norris’s voice rang out clearly as he replied, “Yes. I can’t forget you. Are you happy now?”

Clarissa’s breath caught, stunned. And then, the unmistakable sound of lips meeting rang out from the other end.

In a hurry, her hand fumbled as she ended the call, but in the chaos, the phone slipped and landed in the water. She reached for it without thinking and forgot all about her damaged legs.

She fell hard onto the pavement, right into the cold rain.

For a moment, she lay there, frozen. The storm kept beating down on her, soaking her completely. And then, something inside her broke.

She buried her face in her arms and sobbed.

Fifteen years, she had loved a man who only had eyes for someone else.

Five years of marriage, only to find out it had all been built on guilt and that she had merely been a placeholder.

""Why? Why..."" she whispered over and over, her voice cracking through the rain like a broken song.

Her tears blended with the rain, her pain heavier than the cold that seeped into her bones. And eventually, darkness took her.

When Clarissa finally woke up, she was in a hospital bed.

She blinked slowly, disoriented. A glance at the clock told her it was already noon the next day.

Her phone, which someone had carefully dried out overnight, sat on the bedside table, fully functional, but still silent. No messages. Not a single word from him.

She sat up, just about to call for the discharge paperwork, when the door opened.

She turned her head, a flicker of hope sparking in her eyes, only to see the driver walk in.

The light in her eyes faded instantly.

“Mrs. Daniel,” he greeted awkwardly. “Mr. Daniel’s car got stuck last night, so he asked me to pick you up. How are you feeling?”

Clarissa forced a smile and nodded. The excuse was pathetic, but she didn’t want to make things harder for the driver. So, she simply said, “I’m alright. Let’s go home.”

As such, he quickly took care of the discharge and brought her back.

When they reached the front door, she sat outside for a long time, trying to pull herself together. Only after smoothing out her expression and faking a smile did she open the door.

But the moment she pushed it open, she heard a voice inside.

“Norris, look how much Matthew looks like you.”

Chapter 2

Third Person's POV

Clarissa’s hands froze on the wheels of her chair, stuck in the entryway, unable to go any further.

But Norris’s voice still reached her ears.

“Gabrielle,” he said firmly, “I don’t want to hear you say things like that again, especially not when Clarissa is around.”

Gabrielle’s smile stiffened for a moment. She brushed her hair behind her ear and murmured, “Alright.But one day you will tell her the truth that your divorce is not a fake one but a real one.”

Clarissa stood frozen by the door. Her heart thudded in her chest as she turned to leave, desperate to get out, but in her panic, she bumped hard into the shoe cabinet.

Silence filled the room, and then came hurried footsteps.

Moments later, Norris appeared in front of her, holding a child in his arms.

Clarissa looked up and, unexpectedly, found herself agreeing with what Gabrielle had said earlier. The child really did look like him.

When Norris saw the redness in her eyes, his heart skipped a beat. He quickly set the child down and knelt in front of her, taking her hand in his.

“Clarissa, what happened? My car broke down last night, so I asked the driver to pick you up. Where did you go? Why did he take so long getting you home? If he can’t even do his job right, I’ll just find someone else.”

His concern sounded caring, but every word pierced her like a thorn. She gave a bitter laugh. He hadn’t even bothered to coordinate his lies with the driver.

She had thought she'd grown numb to all of this, that she wouldn’t feel the pain anymore.

But her heart still ached.

Turning away, she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and forced a smile. “It’s nothing worth fussing over. I was with a friend.”

Norris visibly relaxed. “As long as you were with someone you trust. When did you get home? I didn’t hear a thing.”

And just like that, Clarissa understood.

All that faux concern was just a setup for this question.

He wanted to know if she’d overheard anything she wasn’t supposed to.

The warmth inside her turned cold. She pulled her hand back and replied calmly, “I just got in. I didn’t hear a thing.”

Norris’s smile faltered, and his hand hung awkwardly in the air. Even so, he didn’t press the issue.

Clarissa looked past him and noticed the woman still standing behind.

Norris quickly stood and explained, “Clarissa, Gabrielle just got back here and doesn’t have a place to stay. Coincidentally, she’s also become my mom’s new doctor, so I let her stay here for now. Don’t get it wrong.”

The way he tried to defend Gabrielle was so natural and instinctive, extinguishing the last flicker of hope in Clarissa’s chest.

She looked away and clenched her fists, trying to maintain a shred of dignity. “I understand. I’m tired. I’d like to rest now.”

Norris was caught off guard by her composure. A strange feeling tugged at him, but he didn’t dwell on it. Assuming she just needed sleep, he moved to wheel her into the master bedroom.

But she stopped him, saying, “I want to go to my own room.”

In that instant, he froze.

Clarissa didn’t understand why he’d suddenly halted until Gabrielle stepped forward, child in tow, and pointed toward a door.

“You mean that room?” she asked, her tone light, but her words sharp. “That used to be my room when I lived here. I’m used to it, so Norris said I could have it again.”

She called him with such familiarity that it made Clarissa’s stomach turn. More than that, she heard the deliberate challenge in Gabrielle’s voice.

Clarissa turned her head slowly, searching Norris’s expression, hoping for a word of support.

But he offered none.

“It’s just a room,” he said with a shrug. “If Gabrielle wants it, then let's just let her be. I’ll just get the guest room cleaned up for you.”

Clarissa shut her eyes for a moment, fighting back the tide of hurt swelling in her chest.

That room was the one he had carefully decorated for her right after they married. He’d given it to her because he knew her parents had died young, and she had no family to go back to.

He told her that the room would be her sanctuary. If she was ever angry with him and didn’t want to talk, she could go there, and he’d know to come make things right.

But now, he’d given it away like it meant nothing.

Like it was just a room.

Clarissa pressed her hand to her chest, trying to ease the tight, suffocating ache.

Then, firmly insisted, “No. I want that room.”

Third Person's POV

As soon as the words left her mouth, the atmosphere in the room grew heavy.

Norris’s brows furrowed. He couldn’t understand why Clarissa was making such a fuss over a room. Before he could say anything, Matthew came running over.

He charged straight at Clarissa, waving his arms and hitting her legs and face with tiny but surprisingly sharp blows.

“You’re a bad person! A bad lady! Don’t bully my mom! That’s my mom’s room!”

Though small, the boy’s strikes had force behind them. Clarissa’s legs throbbed from the impact. Just as she reached out to push him away, he yanked her hair instead. Pain shot through her scalp, and she instinctively grabbed his wrist to stop him.

But before she could say a word, Matthew screamed.

“Mommy! My hand hurts! She’s hurting me! She’s bullying me! Waaah!”

His wails echoed through the massive villa.

Clarissa winced as her scalp throbbed, tears springing to her eyes from the sting. Her first instinct was to look at Norris. But he wasn’t looking at her, his worried gaze was fixed on Matthew.

She followed his line of sight, and her heart dropped. Matthew’s wrist was bleeding.

Shocked, she sat frozen as Gabrielle scooped the child into her arms, tears streaming down her face as she cradled him.

Clarissa’s mind was still blank when Norris’s voice exploded in fury.

“Clarissa! Matthew is just a kid. What are you doing, picking a fight with him? I already told you Gabrielle is just staying here temporarily. Do you really have to keep holding on to the past? It's just a room. Do you have to be so petty and pick a fight with her over it?”

His blatant favoritism hit Clarissa like a slap to the face, but she forced herself to stay calm.

“Norris—” she began, her voice low.

But he cut her off sharply. “Enough! This is still my house, and it’s not your place to decide who stays where. I gave her that room. Even if you're upset, why did you take it out on a child? I’m really disappointed in you. Think about your actions.”

With that, he stormed out the door, carrying Matthew in his arms like a devoted father. Gabrielle followed close behind.

As she passed Clarissa, Gabrielle threw her a quick smile—small, smug, and unmistakably triumphant.

Only then did she understand everything.

With the red marks from Matthew’s hits still fresh on her face, she watched the three of them together like one happy family. At that moment, she realized she was the outsider.

The tears came uncontrollably then. Her breathing grew ragged, and her chest ached like she couldn’t pull in enough air. She had no idea how long she had cried. At some point, she must have cried herself to sleep.

She was just jolted awake by the ringing of her phone.

She picked it up and heard her aunt’s familiar, gentle voice on the other end.

“Clarissa, the immigration paperwork will be finalized within a week. Are you serious this time? You’re not backing out again, are you? It’s been so long. I miss you.”

Clarissa gave a bitter smile. “I’m serious. I might be bothering you for the rest of my life.”

There was a short pause before her aunt spoke again.

“What about Norris? Are you two… divorced?”

Clarissa let out a quiet, “Mm.Divorced, it's a real divorce."" Clarissa repeated painfully, remembering what Norris said.

Her aunt’s heart ached for her, but she knew comforting words wouldn’t help. So instead, she offered warmth.

“Then start packing. I’ll come to pick you up in a week. Don’t worry about bringing anything. We’ve got everything you need here in the Netherlands.”

“Daryll is still worried about you. He is the Daryll who pursued you when they were little.”

Aunt bit of kindness finally eased the weight in Clarissa’s chest.

After they hung up, she looked around the house. There really wasn’t anything she needed to take with her.

If Gabrielle wanted the room so badly, let her have it.

She could have Norris, too.

That night, Clarissa picked a clean guest room at random, curled up on the bed, and quickly drifted off.

She didn’t know how long she’d slept before a sharp sound of glass shattering startled her awake.

She shot upright and followed the noise, which had come from the master bedroom.

Confused, she wondered what kind of glass item would even be in there. But as she got closer to the door, a sudden chill ran through her. Her instincts screamed that something wasn’t right.

She rushed to the door, pushed it open, and her eyes went wide.

“What the hell are you doing?!”

Chapter 3

Third Person's POV

Glass shards covered the floor. The once-beautiful wedding photo that used to hang on the wall was now shattered and torn beyond repair.

Matthew was stomping on her face in the picture, laughing as he did, spewing crude words that no child his age should even know.

Across the room, Gabrielle turned her head with a smirk, clearly enjoying the scene. Her eyes locked on Clarissa with a mocking glint. She didn’t see her as a threat, barely even as a person.

Then she turned to her son and gave him instructions like she was coaching a performance.

""Matthew, do you want Daddy or not? If you do, then do exactly what Mommy just told you.""

The boy nodded like an obedient little soldier. Then, without a second of hesitation, he picked up a lighter and flicked it on, holding it to a diary clutched in his other hand.

Clarissa's heart seized.

“No! Don’t. Don’t do that!” she shouted, panic surging through her chest.

Frantically, she pushed her wheelchair forward, chasing him down the room. But Matthew thought it was a game. He ran in circles, always just out of reach, laughing like this was all some kind of sick fun.

By the time she finally caught up, the damage was done. The diary had burned to nothing—just a pile of gray ash.

Clarissa’s hands trembled as she picked up the one tiny, half-burnt corner left. Her shoulders shook with sobs she could no longer hold back.

That diary had been the only thing her parents left her. It documented their short lives, their hopes, and their love. It was her only connection to them. For years, in the lonely silence of her life, she'd read it to feel less alone.

When she married Norris, she had brought it with her to this house. She wanted to lock it away, but he told her not to worry.

""As long as I’m here, no one would dare touch it,"" he had said.

But he didn’t keep his word.

Now, not only had someone touched it—they’d destroyed it. And he’d let them walk in and do it.

Clarissa clutched the tiny scrap of paper tightly in her palm. Her voice was raw with fury and heartbreak as she shouted, “Gabrielle! Is this how you raise your son? Teaching him to destroy things that don’t belong to him? Did you ever teach him what basic respect even means?”

For a moment, Gabrielle looked taken aback. Her eyes reddened, and tears welled up.

“Matthew never had a father growing up. I raised him alone. Blame me if you want, but he’s still just a child. You don’t have to be so harsh. I’m sorry, okay? I’ll apologize.”

Clarissa frowned, unsure how to respond, but then she felt a heavy gaze.

She turned and saw Norris standing at the doorway, his expression dark. He strode toward them, face set in a deep scowl.

“Clarissa,” he said, “he’s a child. Why do you keep picking fights with him? Gabrielle even agreed to give you the room back. Isn’t that enough? Do you really have to drive them out to feel satisfied?”

His voice was sharp, edged with frustration.

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She held up the charred piece of the diary with shaking hands, her voice breaking as she tried to explain, “Norris, do you even know what he—”

Before she could finish, he slapped the burnt scrap from her hand.

“It’s just a notebook, Clarissa!” he snapped. “What boy his age isn’t a little wild? Must you make such a big deal out of it? If you want, I’ll buy you a hundred more, a thousand! Will that finally be enough for you?”

She stared at the paper fragment as it fluttered to the ground, only to be stepped on by Gabrielle’s heel.

That was it. Something in her finally gave way.

A hollow laugh escaped her lips, bitter and worn out. She let her body fall back in the wheelchair like all the fight had drained from her.

“Fine,” she said quietly. “You’re right. I’m sorry. It’s my fault.”

For a second, Norris’s expression shifted. Her defeated tone hit him in a place he didn’t expect, and it stung. Seeing despair in her lifeless eyes, he opened his mouth, maybe to apologize, but before he could speak, Matthew cut in.

“Uncle Norris, can I play with this?” the boy asked, holding up a small gift box in his hands.

Norris glanced over, assuming it was just some empty box lying around.

“Sure,” he said. “Go ahead.”

But Clarissa knew exactly what was inside. Her eyes widened in panic, and she quickly shouted, “No! You can’t touch that!”

Third Person's POV

Just when a trace of guilt had begun to creep into Norris’s heart, Clarissa’s voice made him frown again.

“It’s just an old box. Do you have to be so petty, Clarissa? Or is it that you just can’t stand anything he does?”

Clarissa froze. His words hit her like a slap. She stared at him, disbelief washing over her. It hit her then. He truly didn’t remember what was in that box.

Her hand, which had reached out instinctively, lingered midair. She hesitated for a long moment, thinking maybe she should remind him about the ring.

But before she could say anything, Matthew cut in.

“Uncle Norris, I really want this box. Can I throw out what’s inside?”

Already irritated by Clarissa, Norris didn’t even think twice. He just wanted to shut this whole scene down.

“Sure. Toss it if you want.”

Clarissa’s heart sank when she saw Matthew pull out the ring. Her chest tightened, and she instinctively tried to reach for it.

But Matthew was already walking toward the fireplace, just about to toss it in, when he paused. He looked back at his mother.

“Mom, this ring’s kind of pretty. Are you sure we should throw it away?”

Gabrielle’s face stiffened. She didn’t dare look at Norris. Instead, she blinked rapidly, silently urging her son to go through with it.

Norris’s expression shifted slightly when he heard the word “ring.” He turned to look, only to see it fall into the fire.

In a flash, the flames swallowed it.

His gaze snapped to Clarissa. He opened his mouth several times, trying to speak, but the look in her eyes left him hollow. Words stuck in his throat.

Clarissa didn’t look at him. Without a word, she wheeled herself to the fireplace and reached in, trying to retrieve the ring.

The fire had only just started and wasn’t roaring yet, but it was still hot enough to make her flinch and hiss from the pain.

Norris’s heart twisted at the sight. He instinctively stepped forward, ready to pull her back, but Gabrielle got there first.

She hurried over with her son in her arms, gave him a few heavy pats, then turned teary eyes on Clarissa.

“I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. I didn’t teach him better. Please, let me apologize on his behalf. Just tell me how much the ring costs. I’ll save up and buy you a new one.”

Clarissa stared at her blankly, the expression on Gabrielle’s face utterly fake to her.

Not getting a response, Gabrielle glanced at Norris from the corner of her eye and saw his attention still fixed on Clarissa. Her gaze hardened. Then, with a thud, she dropped to her knees.

“It’s all my fault. Please, Clarissa, forgive me. If you’re still mad, then hit me. Go ahead!”

She grabbed Clarissa’s hand and slapped it against her own face. Clarissa tried to pull back, but Gabrielle wouldn’t let go.

A loud smack echoed through the room. Gabrielle’s cheek reddened immediately.

Not satisfied, she let go of Clarissa’s hand and began slapping herself, over and over, crying and apologizing between each blow.

Clarissa frowned at the absurd scene. She opened her mouth to tell her to stop the act, but before she could speak, Norris shoved her away.

Her wheelchair wasn’t locked, so the sudden force sent her sliding backward. The chair slammed into the desk behind her, and she tumbled out, landing hard on the floor.

Norris hadn’t meant to push her that hard. His eyes widened in shock, and he started toward her, but Gabrielle caught his arm first.

He turned to see her swollen, tear-streaked face. Something in him froze. Without saying anything, he pulled her into his arms protectively.

Then he looked down at Clarissa coldly.

“Clarissa, Gabrielle already apologized. Why won’t you let it go? It’s just a ring. Did you really have to humiliate her by trying to fish it out of the fire?”

Clarissa lay awkwardly on the floor, her burned hand pressed against the wooden floorboards. Pain shot through her, leaving her speechless.

Her legs were numb, making it useless. Still, she tried to lift herself multiple times, only to collapse again and again. The helplessness brought tears to her eyes.

Norris hesitated, guilt flickering in his eyes. He took a step forward to help, but Matthew quickly grabbed his hand.

“Uncle Norris, it’s my fault. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make her mad.”

His small hand tugged gently, and that was all it took for Norris’s heart to soften. He steeled himself once again against Clarissa.

“If you love making life difficult for others so much,” he said coldly, “then you can pick yourself up off the floor. Let’s see how long you can keep playing the victim.”

Clarissa stared at him as he stepped right on their torn wedding photo, grinding it under his shoe.

It felt like he was stepping on her heart, crushing what little hope she had left.

In that moment, something inside her broke.

She didn’t want to love him anymore.

Not even a little.

Chapter 4

Third Person's POV

Clarissa lay on the floor for what felt like forever before finally managing to crawl back into her wheelchair.

The bedroom, once warm and comforting, was now a complete mess. But Norris didn’t seem to see any of it. All he remembered was her being ""dramatic.""

Clarissa let out a soft laugh, more bitter than amused, like she was mocking herself.

A moment later, she pulled out her phone and dialed her lawyer.

“How much longer will it take?”

Attorney Turner sounded surprised,. “I was just about to call you! 

The process is almost done,the marriage relationship will be dissolved tomorrow.”

Clarissa found herself subconsciously picking at her palm. So, five years of marriage end in less than five days.

She swallowed the last trace of hesitation and told him to bring it over tonight.

But before she even had time to read the papers, Norris unexpectedly called her away to attend a family dinner.

Clarissa rarely joined the Daniel family gatherings. She knew they didn’t like her, and honestly, the feeling was mutual. So she had no idea why Norris insisted she come this time.

It wasn’t until they got in the car that everything made sense.

“Clarissa,” Gabrielle said sweetly from the backseat, “Matthew’s such a restless little guy. I’ll hold him here, hope you don’t mind?”

The backseat used to have a special seat just for Clarissa. Now, Gabrielle was sitting there, comfortably settled beside Norris.

Even so, Clarissa didn’t even glance at him. After a beat of silence, she replied calmly, “Not at all. Go ahead.”

Norris was caught off guard by how indifferent she sounded. She didn’t argue or complain, which was a surprise. He even got out of the car to help her in, like he used to.

But Clarissa, though still in pain from the burns, pushed herself up into the front passenger seat on her own. When he moved to fold her wheelchair, she subtly pulled it away and quickly did it herself without saying a word.

His hand froze in midair, which was denied again, and a strange emptiness crept in, but was quickly replaced by irritation. After stiffening momentarily, he got into the car.

The drive was quiet in the front as Clarissa kept her mouth shut, contradicting the backseat, which was buzzing with laughter and cheerful small talk, like one happy little family.

It didn’t take long for Clarissa to realize the truth that it was Gabrielle’s idea to bring her along tonight.

Apparently, it was “to help them bond.” But Norris knew perfectly well that his family had never accepted her.

Still, just because Gabrielle asked, he went along with it without a second thought.

Clarissa glanced at the rearview mirror and caught the soft expression in Norris’s eyes as he looked at Gabrielle.

'So that’s what it looks like when he loves someone. Not the forced gentleness he gave me before. It's all real, effortless, and natural,' Clarissa thought.

She stared too long until her face felt wet.

Startled, she snapped out of it and realized her tears had already soaked her cheeks.

Quickly, she turned toward the window and closed her eyes, pretending to sleep as the wind dried her tears.

As always, the Daniel family gathering was crowded. Some people she saw often, others she barely recognized. No matter their usual schedules, everyone made it to these dinners.

There were five large tables filled, but Clarissa only knew a few of the faces.

She had planned to quietly endure the night, play the part of the invisible wife, and get through it.

But Gabrielle had other plans.

“I’ve been living overseas all these years, and only just found out that Norris got married,” she said sweetly, raising her glass. “Let’s all toast to Clarissa for taking care of him these past five years.”

Gabrielle had grown up with Norris, so most people at the table were closer to her than they ever were to Clarissa.

As such, even if they didn’t like Clarissa, they still politely raised their glasses at Gabrielle’s suggestion.

Clarissa sat stiffly, like she was going into battle. Her smile was forced, her fingers trembling slightly as she raised her glass and drank.

She had always been a lightweight. One drink and her face had already gone pale. But Gabrielle wasn’t done.

“Oh, that won’t do,” she chirped, looking around. “So many people toasted you, Clarissa. You can’t just stop after one drink, can you? What do you think, Norris?”

Norris looked at Clarissa’s cold, emotionless face and frowned.

“You only come around once in a while, and you’re already pulling a long face?” he said. “If you hate my family so much, why’d you marry me in the first place?”

Clarissa froze as a memory flashed in her mind. He was the one who had proposed.

But what was the point in bringing that up now?

She laughed quietly. It didn’t matter anymore. They were getting divorced anyway.

She was about to excuse herself and leave when Gabrielle suddenly stood up and grabbed her wheelchair.

“Clarissa’s not very mobile, so I’ll help her. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure she toasts everyone,” she said with a sugary smile. “Right, Clarissa?”

Third Person's POV

Clarissa opened her mouth to refuse, but Norris didn’t give her the chance.

“Clarissa,” he said coldly, “you can either do this the easy way or the hard way.”

The words she’d been holding in her throat died instantly. With all the judgmental stares from his family aimed right at her, she couldn’t bring herself to say no.

With that, Gabrielle pushed her from table to table and made her toast every single person, from elders to cousins, and even the children.

Every time she managed to swallow a drink, another glass was shoved into her hand. Her stomach burned, and her bladder was close to bursting. She tried several times to tell Gabrielle, in a hushed voice, that she needed to use the restroom. But whether by accident or on purpose, Gabrielle ignored her every time.

Finally, after making the full round, Clarissa was wheeled back beside Norris. Her head spun.

She hadn’t even sat for a second before she tried to maneuver her chair toward the bathroom, but the wheels wouldn’t budge. The wheelchair had been locked in place.

She glanced toward Gabrielle, now cheerfully chatting and toasting across the room, and her eyes darkened.

Clarissa took a deep breath and tapped Norris on the shoulder. He turned with a questioning look, but before she could get a word out, Gabrielle was back again, raising her glass.

“Norris,” she said sweetly, “I hardly recognize anyone anymore. Come with me, help me say hello.”

Right after saying that, Gabrielle immediately pulled him away with her. At that time, half the guests had already drifted off to catch up elsewhere.

And just like that, anyone who passed by Clarissa was subtly pulled away by Gabrielle with one excuse or another. Clarissa understood exactly what was happening. But there wasn’t a damn thing she could do about it.

The alcohol was catching up with her. Her stomach churned, and her head pounded. She leaned back in the chair, trying to stay composed. She didn’t even realize she’d lost control.

Until a shrill voice rang out.

“Ew! What’s that smell? Yuck! That bad auntie peed herself! Gross!”

It was Matthew. He shrieked that out loud enough for everyone to hear.

Clarissa snapped to attention, eyes wide. She looked down and felt the wetness beneath her.

Whispers and laughter buzzed around her. People gathered, trying to hide their disgust, but failing miserably.

Her whole body went stiff. She buried her head, her hands clenched tight, and her eyelashes trembling. The kids’ laughter stabbed at her ears.

She gripped the armrests and tried desperately to wheel herself away, but the wheelchair wouldn’t move. Panic crawled up her spine as more eyes zeroed in on her like spotlights.

She braced her hands against the armrests and tried to stand, but the moment her lifeless legs touched the floor, she crumpled like a rag doll.

Fortunately, someone caught her before she hit the ground.

Clarissa didn’t care who it was. She clung to that person like she was drowning, her voice cracking with desperation as she begged, “Take me away... Please... just get me out of here.”

Without a word, the man lifted her into his arms and carried her out of the event hall. He brought her to the staff break room and quietly left her there.

He’d left behind clean clothes for her, folded neatly on her lap.

Changed into new clothes, Clarissa broke down, her shoulders trembling as the tears finally came. Her quiet sobs echoed in the small room.

Suddenly, the door slammed open, and Norris stormed in, face twisted in fury.

“Clarissa!” he roared. “I didn’t realize you already had a new man! Who was he, huh? Tell me! We’re still married, and you’re already cheating on me?! What kind of woman are you?!”

The rage in his voice stunned her into silence.

She looked up at him, disbelief written all over her face.

She had just been humiliated in front of his entire family, and a kind waiter had helped her before she completely fell apart, and this was what Norris assumed?

How could he think that of her? He knew what she'd been through over the past fifteen years. How could he say that?

1l8o9ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterTheBreakup/comments/1l8o9ex/will_she_come_back/,Will she come back?,"**How I met her**

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

We ended up talking and I think a couple days later her step sister got around to talking to madysen and madysen unblocked me and was happy to know I still cared about her and was all like ""so i heard you were asking about me"". A VERY VERY important detail about this was right after she blocked me her dad had died and madysen called me saying she didn't know what to do and she was just driving around, I didn't do the best job of comforting her, all I said was i was sorry and she could come over which she didn't. But her step sister ended up talking to her and I felt awful for her at work, really made me sad thinking about what happened. Also a couple days before I got blocked and her dad died, Madysen was with me and we called him on the phone something he said to me was ""Hope your taking good care of her"", which to this day I never forgot and still think about I think this was back in February or march. Madysen ended up messaging me and admitting she wore my sweatshirt because she missed me and it smelled like me, which was adorable. She did this week without hanging out thing again than I called her and basically set strong boundaries with her saying she needed to try harder and not let petty excuses get in the way of us seeing eachother and I got her to admit she cared and so she genuinely tried the next week and it worked but she slowly fell back into the same habit because I gave up and didn't reinforce what I had said. Every time we hung out was past 1 am and we just fell asleep together because I worked night shifts and that was when I was free. I really didn't like this.

**Things went really south**

At a certain point we hadn't hung out for two weeks and i met up with her and went to a movie with her and afterwards had her meet me back at my apartment so i could give her a necklace, she had told me she was sick and I said I didn't care (90% she was lying) we hung out everything was ok she looked a little off but was happy after I gave her the necklace and stuff. The next couple of days were really weird. She ended up messaging and tell me she didn't want to be together and I was a rebound for some other guy she was into but never hung out with in person and bla bla bla than I retaliated and explained my view on our relationship and wasn't going to give up, she went along with it and conceded essentially. I told her to give me a list of everything she wanted in a man and she already had one coincidently and I made a doc and spent like four hours explaining what kind of man i was under each category and I sent it to her later that night. I was showing I could do it and commit.

She looked at it didn't say anything for a day than I did a follow up and she was all mad I took a day to double text, I think that night she drank a bunch and messaged me throughout the entire night going over relationship questions like bounderies and what we liked about eachother and she admitted she really liked me and had to act like she didn't or something and was liked ""oops i wasn't supposed to say that"" I think she deleted it later.

The next couple of days were even weirder I think she ended up doing the same thing saying she didn't think we should date but then agreed to work things out and sent me a relationship post the next day blabla bla than a couple days later she didn't respond to me at all and I got all needy messaging her over and over and she blocked me. I found out through her step sister she had met up with the guy she had been into they made out and stuff and he gave her hickies. Madysen sent pictures to the group chat with her step sister and her step sister said ""ouu is that from Ethan"" she responded and said ""No from jacob"" I had messaged her step sister to find out what happened and she told me everything. Madysen had left one channel of communication open on tiktok and so I messaged her acting as if I didn't know at first and she tried playing off the end of our relationship like she didn't care about me anymore and said ""theres no way your this obsessed"" keep in mind we'd been together a couple months. I gave it a bit and wasn't gonna say anything about her cheating because I didn't want her to know I spoke to her stepsister but I started progressively getting more and more upset with myself and her and spent the night writing a long ass paragraph calling her out. I sent it and she tried defending herself and justifying what she did and nitpicking me, I didn't believe in any of the nitpicking obviously. She blocked me long story short and I spent the next month listening to relationship audiobooks and learning to get her back, I ended up becoming good friends with her step sister and we hung out and talked about her a bunch. I didn't know how but in my head I was gonna get her back.

I put my tiktok on private and Madysen had kept viewing my profile, eventually i went public and she unblocked me completely. I didn't try and talk to her for the rest of the month and was about to give up thinking about her than her aunt somehow had my number and messaged me saying madysen talked about me a lot and felt aweful about what happened and was upset all the time and guilty like always. I chose to reach out to her because I stopped viewing her as a monster after this, obviously what happened was the guy she got with blocked her for the second time he was some marine. I talked to madysen off and on for the last month it was very slow and tedious getting her to build comfort.

**We hangout again**

We eventually hung out again and she was super awkward and quiet, we went on a hike and I got her to come back to my apartment she didn't want to, She wanted to go hangout downtown I agreed but got her to come in first and park at my apartment. She agreed but we never went down town. I spent like two hours making her smile and telling her to stop being awkward and she was laughing so much and when she tried leaving I wouldn't let her and she loved it and i tickled her and stuff but eventually I let her go. She said she’d call me that night and we could hangout soon possibly the next day. She sent me a message and got my number back from me and i responded than she never texted me back that night….”ummm ok”. The next day I waited no response, I messaged and said maybe I’ll just hangout with one of my other girlfriends tonight (yawning emoji). Her response was ok have fun be safe and she was all passive aggressive with me and I said I’ll just give you space, I was only joking with her even though unfortunately there was some truth to it which I felt bad about, it was only because I was trying not to give her all my energy. 

**Weird communication**

It was weird talking to her after this for like a month but I sent a reel that said you have a beautiful smile and she called me the next morning for a sec and showed me she dyed her hair. She agreed to call later and I tried and no answer and then no response. I tried planning to hangout with her on a specific day and she said it depends on what time and she kind of talked to me like we were gonna ended being like around 8 work? And she talked to me like she was going to than ended up saying she was at a party. I had put off hanging out with a different girl that day for her and it through me off for good with that other girl so I set a mini boundary with her and told her she should have let me know what she was doing. She opened and no response (meaning she was anxious trust me i know her). A couple days later messaged and said “Hey you're welcome to come over tuesday just let me know ahead of time. NO RESPONSE for two days but she read it. Guess what I was thinking to myself there's no way she doesn’t message me before then and it was the night before tuesday when I was driving home i was having this thought and I intentionally left my phone at home while at work as I usually do. I got home and she spam called me four times and sent and unsent a message than added my snap back. I messaged and said “are you up still? No response but i saw she was active on tiktok. I was on tiktok looking for a reel to send her for a while and she kept going off and on and I found one, I was trying to reassure her and make things not weird so I sent a reel that said “im not sure what the future holds but I want to figure it out with you” she immediately opened tiktok back up and blocked me also after I sent my message I forgot to mention she unadded my snap friend request which i was gonna accept in the morning so i didn’t seem needy. I’ve been blocked for over a week on everything, phone and imessage also. I messaged her aunt asking if I could call her and explain what happened and maybe she could talk to madysen and her aunt agreed sounding concerned for us but the next day her aunt never responded again its been a week that was like tuesday the day after the block. I even tried calling the aunt and it said “caller is not available right now” so obviously madysen talked to her. 

**My behavior over the last week**

I’ve been extremely reckless and my buddy drove to the ocean which is three hours away after I spent the whole day driving for hours with my other friend whos a girl. We drove to the ocean and drank. He was drinking and driving but hes good at it and has a high tolerance although I know thats still dangerous. I drank and I never drink I felt pretty optimistic about talking to the aunt the next day. We stayed up all through the night and this indian dude tried to call the cops on us for drinking at night and driving. We got back and the aunt never responded on day 3 of being blocked. I went to the strip club a couple days later and drank with my friend and we argued at night, I’ve been hella overspending, I’ve felt awful everyday and unmotivated even though I would focus on other stuff before being blocked. I’ve been trying to message and call her step sister but she’s been hella distracted and even just so happened to go to a cabin for a couple days normally Im able to talk to her and call, she agreed to twice in one day but then didn’t answer and still hasn’t gotten back to me since yesterday. I even told her im anxious. I’ve genuinely been so anxious guys I learned I'm a lot more attached to this girl emotionally than I thought I even drank two and a half glasses of wine last night with my friends on the phone and got super drunk but the buzz was horrible mostly. Also like I said I don’t drink.

**Moving forward?**

Guys in my head I love this girl and my anxiety has been so I high I wanted to date her again so I could set firmer boundaries and make the relationship work this time after listening to audio books on women and understanding what I was doing wrong before, I never got to that point and like I said im super anxious and just wondering if shes gonna come back again or what I did wrong or why she blocked me again. I really care about her and I know she cared about me otherwise she wouldn’t have done this. Will she come back likely? Also keep in mind this is my longest anything with a girl before this my longest was like a month max. Also guys I know your all gonna be like move on but the truth is I wouldn’t have committed so much time and energy into this girl if thats truly what I wanted and I get no benefit from giving up especially if I don’t fully know why she blocked me. Can you guys give me some decent advice to help me stop being anxious but still keep the door open with her. I haven’t had that call with her step sister sense right after madysen blocked me which i forgot to mention but i’ve been trying to talk to her again and asked if we could hangout soon, i'm waiting for her to get back.And yes im obsessed with her but only because I really care about her. I tried also leaving her a voicemail explaining everything even though i was blocked it let me not sure if it went through though. Is there hope guys? Also I’d rather suffer trying than give up and be back where I started.

**How I met her**

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

We ended up talking and I think a couple days later her step sister got around to talking to madysen and madysen unblocked me and was happy to know I still cared about her and was all like ""so i heard you were asking about me"". A VERY VERY important detail about this was right after she blocked me her dad had died and madysen called me saying she didn't know what to do and she was just driving around, I didn't do the best job of comforting her, all I said was i was sorry and she could come over which she didn't. But her step sister ended up talking to her and I felt awful for her at work, really made me sad thinking about what happened. Also a couple days before I got blocked and her dad died, Madysen was with me and we called him on the phone something he said to me was ""Hope your taking good care of her"", which to this day I never forgot and still think about I think this was back in February or march. Madysen ended up messaging me and admitting she wore my sweatshirt because she missed me and it smelled like me, which was adorable. She did this week without hanging out thing again than I called her and basically set strong boundaries with her saying she needed to try harder and not let petty excuses get in the way of us seeing eachother and I got her to admit she cared and so she genuinely tried the next week and it worked but she slowly fell back into the same habit because I gave up and didn't reinforce what I had said. Every time we hung out was past 1 am and we just fell asleep together because I worked night shifts and that was when I was free. I really didn't like this.

**Things went really south**

At a certain point we hadn't hung out for two weeks and i met up with her and went to a movie with her and afterwards had her meet me back at my apartment so i could give her a necklace, she had told me she was sick and I said I didn't care (90% she was lying) we hung out everything was ok she looked a little off but was happy after I gave her the necklace and stuff. The next couple of days were really weird. She ended up messaging and tell me she didn't want to be together and I was a rebound for some other guy she was into but never hung out with in person and bla bla bla than I retaliated and explained my view on our relationship and wasn't going to give up, she went along with it and conceded essentially. I told her to give me a list of everything she wanted in a man and she already had one coincidently and I made a doc and spent like four hours explaining what kind of man i was under each category and I sent it to her later that night. I was showing I could do it and commit.

She looked at it didn't say anything for a day than I did a follow up and she was all mad I took a day to double text, I think that night she drank a bunch and messaged me throughout the entire night going over relationship questions like bounderies and what we liked about eachother and she admitted she really liked me and had to act like she didn't or something and was liked ""oops i wasn't supposed to say that"" I think she deleted it later.

The next couple of days were even weirder I think she ended up doing the same thing saying she didn't think we should date but then agreed to work things out and sent me a relationship post the next day blabla bla than a couple days later she didn't respond to me at all and I got all needy messaging her over and over and she blocked me. I found out through her step sister she had met up with the guy she had been into they made out and stuff and he gave her hickies. Madysen sent pictures to the group chat with her step sister and her step sister said ""ouu is that from Ethan"" she responded and said ""No from jacob"" I had messaged her step sister to find out what happened and she told me everything. Madysen had left one channel of communication open on tiktok and so I messaged her acting as if I didn't know at first and she tried playing off the end of our relationship like she didn't care about me anymore and said ""theres no way your this obsessed"" keep in mind we'd been together a couple months. I gave it a bit and wasn't gonna say anything about her cheating because I didn't want her to know I spoke to her stepsister but I started progressively getting more and more upset with myself and her and spent the night writing a long ass paragraph calling her out. I sent it and she tried defending herself and justifying what she did and nitpicking me, I didn't believe in any of the nitpicking obviously. She blocked me long story short and I spent the next month listening to relationship audiobooks and learning to get her back, I ended up becoming good friends with her step sister and we hung out and talked about her a bunch. I didn't know how but in my head I was gonna get her back.

I put my tiktok on private and Madysen had kept viewing my profile, eventually i went public and she unblocked me completely. I didn't try and talk to her for the rest of the month and was about to give up thinking about her than her aunt somehow had my number and messaged me saying madysen talked about me a lot and felt aweful about what happened and was upset all the time and guilty like always. I chose to reach out to her because I stopped viewing her as a monster after this, obviously what happened was the guy she got with blocked her for the second time he was some marine. I talked to madysen off and on for the last month it was very slow and tedious getting her to build comfort.

**We hangout again**

We eventually hung out again and she was super awkward and quiet, we went on a hike and I got her to come back to my apartment she didn't want to, She wanted to go hangout downtown I agreed but got her to come in first and park at my apartment. She agreed but we never went down town. I spent like two hours making her smile and telling her to stop being awkward and she was laughing so much and when she tried leaving I wouldn't let her and she loved it and i tickled her and stuff but eventually I let her go. She said she’d call me that night and we could hangout soon possibly the next day. She sent me a message and got my number back from me and i responded than she never texted me back that night….”ummm ok”. The next day I waited no response, I messaged and said maybe I’ll just hangout with one of my other girlfriends tonight (yawning emoji). Her response was ok have fun be safe and she was all passive aggressive with me and I said I’ll just give you space, I was only joking with her even though unfortunately there was some truth to it which I felt bad about, it was only because I was trying not to give her all my energy. 

**Weird communication**

It was weird talking to her after this for like a month but I sent a reel that said you have a beautiful smile and she called me the next morning for a sec and showed me she dyed her hair. She agreed to call later and I tried and no answer and then no response. I tried planning to hangout with her on a specific day and she said it depends on what time and she kind of talked to me like we were gonna ended being like around 8 work? And she talked to me like she was going to than ended up saying she was at a party. I had put off hanging out with a different girl that day for her and it through me off for good with that other girl so I set a mini boundary with her and told her she should have let me know what she was doing.

1l8o77e,https://i.redd.it/a2qr6eqtn96f1.png,Top Employee Engagement Trends for 2025: What Collaboration Tools Should Focus On,"Hey CollabTech enthusiasts, 👋

I’ve dug into recent research to spotlight the *freshest employee engagement trends* that collaboration software teams should watch in 2025:

# 1. Engagement Remains Stagnant – Disengagement Lingers

* McLean’s 2019–2024 survey shows employee engagement is *roughly flat*, hovering \~2% above pre-pandemic levels, with periodic dips to pre‑COVID benchmarks [prnewswire.com+6hr.mcleanco.com+6shrm.org+6](https://hr.mcleanco.com/research/ss/employee-engagement-trends-report-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* Globally, only \~23% of workers are engaged; 62% show up but feel disconnected [ft.com+2primeast.com+2cerkl.com+2](https://primeast.com/us/insights/59-employee-engagement-statistics-for-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**💡Implication:** Tools must offer more than basic chat/project tracking—they need to measurably drive genuine engagement.

# 2. Management Engagement is Key

* Gallup data shows manager engagement dropped from 30% to 27% in 2024; overall employee engagement fell from 23% to 21%, costing \~$438 billion globally [businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/manager-engagement-gallup-workplace-report-2025-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* Only 44% of managers have formal training [shrm.org+15businessinsider.com+15lumapps.com+15](https://www.businessinsider.com/manager-engagement-gallup-workplace-report-2025-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**💡Implication:** Embedding leadership enablement features—like feedback tools and guidance—can empower managers and elevate team-wide engagement.

# 3. Leadership Support Drives Engagement

* Strong leadership correlates with a **24% increase** in overall engagement [effectory.com](https://www.effectory.com/knowledge/what-really-drives-employee-engagement-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**💡Implication:** Platforms that promote transparent leadership, recognition, and peer appreciation (e.g. shoutouts, milestones) can foster a more engaged workplace.

# 4. Psychological Well‑Being & Loneliness

* Deloitte flags “loneliness” as a **business risk**, not just a wellness issue [greatplacetowork.com+5gartner.com+5en.wikipedia.org+5](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/future-of-work-trends?utm_source=chatgpt.com). The global workplace is at a 10‑year low in employee enthusiasm [effectory.com+15axios.com+15gallup.com+15](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-7b798920-d1d0-11ef-8d57-a3028be5c976?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**💡Implication:** Incorporate social and wellness touchpoints—virtual coffee, peer support systems, check-ins—to counter isolation and improve well‑being.

# 🔍 Final Thoughts for Collaboration Software

* **Target manager training**: Integrate micro-modules or peer‑coaching tools for new and seasoned leaders.
* **Recognize & reward culture**: Encourage spotlighting contributions and milestones across teams.
* **Foster empathy and connection**: Design features that promote informal interactions and camaraderie.

\*\*What are your thoughts?\*\*

* Have you seen engagement improvements by empowering managers via software?
* Any tools out there that effectively combat loneliness or stretch beyond task tracking?

1l8o6c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayanadSilverwoods/comments/1l8o6c0/my_amazing_4_night_stay_at_wayanad_silver_woods/,My Amazing 4 Night Stay at Wayanad Silver Woods Resort,"I recently stayed four nights with my family at [Wayanad Silver Woods Resort](https://wayanadsilverwoods.com/facilities-in-wayanad-silverwoods-resort/), and I really wanted to share our experience because it turned out to be much better than we expected. Before booking, I had read mixed reviews about different resorts in Wayanad, so I wasn’t fully confident. But Silver Woods turned out to be a great choice.

We picked this resort over a few bigger names mainly because their team was very helpful and responsive right from the time we inquired. I also liked that they follow eco-friendly practices. And yes, the beautiful photos of the resort and the lake view definitely caught my attention.

**Arrival and First Impressions**

As soon as we reached, we knew we had made the right choice. There was a valet to take care of our car, which was such a relief especially since it was raining when we arrived. The staff welcomed us with warm smiles and served us a traditional welcome drink while we admired the peaceful view of Banasura Lake.

Check-in was quick and smooth. What really surprised me was that the reception team actually remembered our earlier conversation during booking. That small touch made us feel truly welcomed.

**The Rooms – Total Comfort and Beautiful Views**

We booked the Lakeview Suite that came with a private jacuzzi, and honestly, it was amazing. Waking up every morning to the lake view was a dream. The jacuzzi in the room, facing the lake, made our evenings extra special especially during sunset.

The room was big, clean, and nicely done. Everything from the air conditioning to the lighting was perfect. The toiletries provided were also of good quality. But the best part? Definitely the private jacuzzi.

**Food and Dining Experience**

We mostly ate at their main restaurant, Banasura, and we really enjoyed every meal. The food was fresh, well made, and had a good mix of options for everyone in the family. The restaurant overlooks the lake, so even meal times felt special.

Some things we really loved were the South Indian breakfast, the fresh local fish dishes, and the coffee. They also have a lakeside cafe which is perfect for relaxing. Prices were also quite fair for the quality and quantity served.

**Facilities That Really Work**

The infinity pool is even more beautiful than what you see in photos. Swimming there while looking at Banasura hills was a one-of-a-kind experience. The pool was clean and well looked after.

We also visited the Ayur Sparsh Spa and it was one of the most relaxing parts of the trip. The therapists were professional, and the whole spa setup with nature sounds in the background was very calming.

Their Lakkidi Clubhouse had a good bar, comfortable seating, and a nice family-friendly vibe in the evenings.

**Activities and Easy Location**

The resort offers quite a few activities that are really well planned. We went on a nature walk with a guide, did some early morning bird watching, cycled around the property, and the kids loved the play area. It’s also pet friendly, which was nice to see.

The location is great for sightseeing. We visited Edakkal Caves, Soochipara Falls, and a nearby wildlife sanctuary without any trouble. The resort helped arrange transport too, so we didn’t have to worry about planning.

**What Makes This Place Special**

What I liked most about Wayanad Silver Woods is that it doesn’t just focus on luxury, it also cares about nature. The way the resort is built blends beautifully with the surroundings instead of spoiling them.

The staff were fantastic. They were always ready to help, very polite, and genuinely cared that we had a good time. It didn’t feel fake or forced, which made a big difference.

**How I met her**

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

We ended up talking and I think a couple days later her step sister got around to talking to madysen and madysen unblocked me and was happy to know I still cared about her and was all like ""so i heard you were asking about me"". A VERY VERY important detail about this was right after she blocked me her dad had died and madysen called me saying she didn't know what to do and she was just driving around, I didn't do the best job of comforting her, all I said was i was sorry and she could come over which she didn't. But her step sister ended up talking to her and I felt awful for her at work, really made me sad thinking about what happened. Also a couple days before I got blocked and her dad died, Madysen was with me and we called him on the phone something he said to me was ""Hope your taking good care of her"", which to this day I never forgot and still think about I think this was back in February or march. Madysen ended up messaging me and admitting she wore my sweatshirt because she missed me and it smelled like me, which was adorable. She did this week without hanging out thing again than I called her and basically set strong boundaries with her saying she needed to try harder and not let petty excuses get in the way of us seeing eachother and I got her to admit she cared and so she genuinely tried the next week and it worked but she slowly fell back into the same habit because I gave up and didn't reinforce what I had said. Every time we hung out was past 1 am and we just fell asleep together because I worked night shifts and that was when I was free. I really didn't like this.

**Things went really south**

At a certain point we hadn't hung out for two weeks and i met up with her and went to a movie with her and afterwards had her meet me back at my apartment so i could give her a necklace, she had told me she was sick and I said I didn't care (90% she was lying) we hung out everything was ok she looked a little off but was happy after I gave her the necklace and stuff. The next couple of days were really weird. She ended up messaging and tell me she didn't want to be together and I was a rebound for some other guy she was into but never hung out with in person and bla bla bla than I retaliated and explained my view on our relationship and wasn't going to give up, she went along with it and conceded essentially. I told her to give me a list of everything she wanted in a man and she already had one coincidently and I made a doc and spent like four hours explaining what kind of man i was under each category and I sent it to her later that night. I was showing I could do it and commit.

She looked at it didn't say anything for a day than I did a follow up and she was all mad I took a day to double text, I think that night she drank a bunch and messaged me throughout the entire night going over relationship questions like bounderies and what we liked about eachother and she admitted she really liked me and had to act like she didn't or something and was liked ""oops i wasn't supposed to say that"" I think she deleted it later.

The next couple of days were even weirder I think she ended up doing the same thing saying she didn't think we should date but then agreed to work things out and sent me a relationship post the next day blabla bla than a couple days later she didn't respond to me at all and I got all needy messaging her over and over and she blocked me. I found out through her step sister she had met up with the guy she had been into they made out and stuff and he gave her hickies. Madysen sent pictures to the group chat with her step sister and her step sister said ""ouu is that from Ethan"" she responded and said ""No from jacob"" I had messaged her step sister to find out what happened and she told me everything. Madysen had left one channel of communication open on tiktok and so I messaged her acting as if I didn't know at first and she tried playing off the end of our relationship like she didn't care about me anymore and said ""theres no way your this obsessed"" keep in mind we'd been together a couple months. I gave it a bit and wasn't gonna say anything about her cheating because I didn't want her to know I spoke to her stepsister but I started progressively getting more and more upset with myself and her and spent the night writing a long ass paragraph calling her out. I sent it and she tried defending herself and justifying what she did and nitpicking me, I didn't believe in any of the nitpicking obviously. She blocked me long story short and I spent the next month listening to relationship audiobooks and learning to get her back, I ended up becoming good friends with her step sister and we hung out and talked about her a bunch. I didn't know how but in my head I was gonna get her back.

I put my tiktok on private and Madysen had kept viewing my profile, eventually i went public and she unblocked me completely. I didn't try and talk to her for the rest of the month and was about to give up thinking about her than her aunt somehow had my number and messaged me saying madysen talked about me a lot and felt aweful about what happened and was upset all the time and guilty like always. I chose to reach out to her because I stopped viewing her as a monster after this, obviously what happened was the guy she got with blocked her for the second time he was some marine. I talked to madysen off and on for the last month it was very slow and tedious getting her to build comfort.

**We hangout again**

We eventually hung out again and she was super awkward and quiet, we went on a hike and I got her to come back to my apartment she didn't want to, She wanted to go hangout downtown I agreed but got her to come in first and park at my apartment. She agreed but we never went down town. I spent like two hours making her smile and telling her to stop being awkward and she was laughing so much and when she tried leaving I wouldn't let her and she loved it and i tickled her and stuff but eventually I let her go. She said she’d call me that night and we could hangout soon possibly the next day. She sent me a message and got my number back from me and i responded than she never texted me back that night….”ummm ok”. The next day I waited no response, I messaged and said maybe I’ll just hangout with one of my other girlfriends tonight (yawning emoji). Her response was ok have fun be safe and she was all passive aggressive with me and I said I’ll just give you space, I was only joking with her even though unfortunately there was some truth to it which I felt bad about, it was only because I was trying not to give her all my energy. 

**Weird communication**

It was weird talking to her after this for like a month but I sent a reel that said you have a beautiful smile and she called me the next morning for a sec and showed me she dyed her hair. She agreed to call later and I tried and no answer and then no response. I tried planning to hangout with her on a specific day and she said it depends on what time and she kind of talked to me like we were gonna ended being like around 8 work? And she talked to me like she was going to than ended up saying she was at a party. I had put off hanging out with a different girl that day for her and it through me off for good with that other girl so I set a mini boundary with her and told her she should have let me know what she was doing. She opened and no response (meaning she was anxious trust me i know her). A couple days later messaged and said “Hey you're welcome to come over tuesday just let me know ahead of time. NO RESPONSE for two days but she read it. Guess what I was thinking to myself there's no way she doesn’t message me before then and it was the night before tuesday when I was driving home i was having this thought and I intentionally left my phone at home while at work as I usually do. I got home and she spam called me four times and sent and unsent a message than added my snap back. I messaged and said “are you up still? No response but i saw she was active on tiktok. I was on tiktok looking for a reel to send her for a while and she kept going off and on and I found one, I was trying to reassure her and make things not weird so I sent a reel that said “im not sure what the future holds but I want to figure it out with you” she immediately opened tiktok back up and blocked me also after I sent my message I forgot to mention she unadded my snap friend request which i was gonna accept in the morning so i didn’t seem needy. I’ve been blocked for over a week on everything, phone and imessage also. I messaged her aunt asking if I could call her and explain what happened and maybe she could talk to madysen and her aunt agreed sounding concerned for us but the next day her aunt never responded again its been a week that was like tuesday the day after the block. I even tried calling the aunt and it said “caller is not available right now” so obviously madysen talked to her. 

**My behavior over the last week**

I’ve been extremely reckless and my buddy drove to the ocean which is three hours away after I spent the whole day driving for hours with my other friend whos a girl. We drove to the ocean and drank. He was drinking and driving but hes good at it and has a high tolerance although I know thats still dangerous. I drank and I never drink I felt pretty optimistic about talking to the aunt the next day. We stayed up all through the night and this indian dude tried to call the cops on us for drinking at night and driving. We got back and the aunt never responded on day 3 of being blocked. I went to the strip club a couple days later and drank with my friend and we argued at night, I’ve been hella overspending, I’ve felt awful everyday and unmotivated even though I would focus on other stuff before being blocked. I’ve been trying to message and call her step sister but she’s been hella distracted and even just so happened to go to a cabin for a couple days normally Im able to talk to her and call, she agreed to twice in one day but then didn’t answer and still hasn’t gotten back to me since yesterday. I even told her im anxious. I’ve genuinely been so anxious guys I learned I'm a lot more attached to this girl emotionally than I thought I even drank two and a half glasses of wine last night with my friends on the phone and got super drunk but the buzz was horrible mostly. Also like I said I don’t drink.

**Moving forward?**

Guys in my head I love this girl and my anxiety has been so I high I wanted to date her again so I could set firmer boundaries and make the relationship work this time after listening to audio books on women and understanding what I was doing wrong before, I never got to that point and like I said im super anxious and just wondering if shes gonna come back again or what I did wrong or why she blocked me again. I really care about her and I know she cared about me otherwise she wouldn’t have done this. Will she come back likely? Also keep in mind this is my longest anything with a girl before this my longest was like a month max. Also guys I know your all gonna be like move on but the truth is I wouldn’t have committed so much time and energy into this girl if thats truly what I wanted and I get no benefit from giving up especially if I don’t fully know why she blocked me. Can you guys give me some decent advice to help me stop being anxious but still keep the door open with her. I haven’t had that call with her step sister sense right after madysen blocked me which i forgot to mention but i’ve been trying to talk to her again and asked if we could hangout soon, i'm waiting for her to get back.And yes im obsessed with her but only because I really care about her. I tried also leaving her a voicemail explaining everything even though i was blocked it let me not sure if it went through though. Is there hope guys? Also I’d rather suffer trying than give up and be back where I started.

1l8o5hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1l8o5hf/covid_vaccination_helped_me/,Covid vaccination helped me,"TL;DR: I have improved since getting the Covid vaccine.

I have ME/CFS post-Covid. May 19th (about three weeks ago) I got the Covid vaccine, partly to protect me against getting Covid again, but also in hopes that it would help me improve. I can now say without doubt that it has helped me. You can see my previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1kqapm7/comment/mujdnv2/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1kqapm7/comment/mujdnv2/?context=3)

I'm not spending most of my day lying in bed, I can be up and moving around. I've gone out to coffee with friends and had friends over and was able to sit up with them and talk and eat lunch instead of spending most of the time laying down. PEM is just not occuring in the way that it had been. I'm not paying for doing nice things like having coffee with friends. I notice that the way my muscles hurt now is totally different. It feels more like sore muscles because of moving them in ways I haven't been able to in a long time; not the PEM kind of burning, aching feeling.

  
I'm still sick. I still have to pace, I still have fatigue. But I am doing better. 

  
This is similar to how I improved for 3 months after my last Covid vaccine in October. From October to December I was doing really well, progressing slowly but surely and was able to do things like going for a short walk in the park. I was also dating and socializing. (But not working, I imagine if I had to work, I probably wouldn't have been able to do all of that, still, a huge improvement from being mostly bed and housebound).

I got worse again in January, and I believe it was from over-exertion due to moving to a new flat and Chrsitmas, but also just feeling invincible and being overly-optimistic that I was getting better and could do more. But it also could be that the positive affects of the vaccine were wearing off. So we shall see this time. Will I keep feeling better and better? Will it last at least 3 months or more or less? Will I be able to extend the benefits longer with careful pacing?

If you want to read the information and research I found on the positive affects of the Covid vaccine for those with long-Covid, I put links to them in my original post about getting the vaccine.

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

1l8o43r,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1l8o43r/dizzy_like_feeling/,Dizzy like feeling,"So this may not have a direct link to me having psychosis and possibly schizophrenia but im gonna ask it either way. I was staying in my house for nearly 4 years since summer of 2021. The only time i would leave the house would be to get to the psychiatrist who is very near and that would be by car with my dad driving us there. So i was leaving the house just once every \~2 months and even then i was taking 10mg valium to be more relaxed. Now things have changed as my dad was diagnosed with stage IV cancer. Since the 1st of may this year im going out everyday. In the beggining it was just to drive a little nearby to get the feeling again and grab coffee for me and my sister. Later around 24th of may me and my sister went to the doctor to get ultrasounds done cause we were freaked out we might have something. The results for me showed slightly enlarged left atrium and stage 1 fatty liver. Both were attributed to my enormous weight and are reversible/managable with diet and 30 min walking every day. I also got a signed paper from the cardiologist that i can exersice. Now to the dizzy like feeling. When im walking and speaking and laughing either with friends or my sister i get a little dizzy and sometimes my vision blurs slightly but i dont lose balance and i can keep walking in a straight line. I got of the phone with my psychiatrist today and he told me he believes it is anxiety and to give it 10 days and call him again. Ive asked chatGPT too and it says possibly sensory overload cause when im alone and listening to music or podcast i dont get dizzy. Im not asking for diagnosis or something like that but more if anyone has had familiar issues and how did they manage it. I know shizophrenia can make people not want to leave the house just as psychosis did for me. So someone who has gone through something similar ill gladly appreciate some tips,now with my dad weak from chemo/cancer im the only one who can drive the car. I dont want to be a burden on them and i want to be able to function just like or close to normal and this dizziness makes me quetion many things. What if staying at home did some kind of damage to the brain and now it cant proccess multiple things at the same time and i get this dizzy feeling as a reaction? What if im damaged beyond repair now? I dream of going out sitting in coffee shops with friends and be able to chat normally without this crippling anxiety feeling.

1l8o3q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCD/comments/1l8o3q0/ucd_viva_experience_comp_sci_phd/,UCD Viva experience (Comp Sci PhD),"Hi everyone, I just thought I'd share my viva experiences because before mine, I was desperately trying to find out more myself. This won't necessarily be useful - but it's one more story anyway.

I had my viva 6 months after submission, which was unusual but down to my own organisation and not getting back to my supervisor in suggesting external examiners and getting all of that approved (it was very very hit and miss as to whether I was going to meet the January deadline). I was able to submit the thesis in January before the exam committee was in place, although this \*isn't\* standard and was discretionary. In terms of the committee I knew the chair personally, didn't know the internal who is an expert in \~20% of the research in the thesis, the external is an expert in the other 80%. 

So, 6 month later I was worrying that I wouldn't remember the smaller details, e.g. extra details from papers I've cited, etc. To prepare, I printed out the thesis and read it line by line over the course of 2 weeks, until 90% of the way through when I couldn't take it any more but I was burning out... I annotated it, stuck in post-it notes, and put it all in a binder to bring with me. I had numerous meltdowns in the preceding weeks (roughly 1 per error, and there were many errors). I watched a load of YouTube videos, some more helpful than others. I had a final meeting with my supervisor 2 days before the viva. I read my concluding chapter the day before - this was a mistake - I should have started with this and maybe the presentation would have flowed better.

The viva was scheduled to be 3 hours. I prepared a 20 minute presentation which was like the highlight reel, and practiced this about 4 times 1-2 days (and the morning) before. I prepared cue-cards because I knew I'd forget the correct terminology or miss a salient point otherwise.

Morning of the viva, I was a bit thrown as the chair, internal and my supervisor were all chatting in the foyer and I didn't sleep the night before. I was so nervous I garbled something at them, not sure what, and my supervisor did the decent thing which was to move me away from everyone else and get me a coffee.

When it was time to go in, I set my stuff down, the external joined via Zoom, then I was promptly asked to leave. I was in such a state I didn't even say hello to the extern. 5 minutes later the internal came to get me and I came back in and gave the presentation. The presentation was powerpoint, a load of text and lots of figures from the thesis, organised by research questions.

The first few questions were from the external - I don't even remember them - but I definitely didn't answer them properly and apologised for this. They were really kind and rephrased the questions. I am still not sure what they were or if I answered them. Then the 2 examiners took it in turn to ask questions. None of the questions they asked were questions I would have got from YouTube or blog posts - they were all very specific. I don't think I could have prepared for them in any other way than writing the thesis and knowing the research. What absolutely made it 100 times better was working on papers related to the thesis, because this had inadvertently given me a good critical perspective/ retrospective on what the thesis proposed\*. It came back to what my supervisor said which is - you don't have to defend the indefensible - the thesis is a point in time. You can iterate over it, your opinions can change, but in the viva you are proving that \*you\* did the research, you know the field, and your research is sound... It really came down to that. Overall the experience went from terrifying to enjoyable.

  
\*I also read a lot of the external's research, which was relevant to the thesis and cited throughout.

No-one asked me about spelling mistakes (although they said I could fix any). No-one asked any of the ""internet"" viva preparation questions (“Can you tell us about your research?”; ""What triggered your interest in this subject?”; “Why is this an area that is worthy of study?”...) etc. The questions were - in your formalism you do X, but in your implementation you say Y. What are the limits of what <the research> can do? Etc. On page ZZZ, you say ""V"", do you mean ""P""? What do you mean by ... etc. ""This was hard to follow, can you walk me through it"", and ""Does RQ2 actually depend on RQ1""  *( <- brutal but fair )*. 

After 1 hour 40 minutes they asked me to leave the room, I was called back in 2 minutes later, and passed with minor corrections. I had a little cry and accidentally grimaced in the group photo. It was hard, the questions were really difficult. I didn't answer every question perfectly (or even adequately). My preparation was largely useless \*except\* re-reading the thesis, practicing the presentation and working on publications post submission. Everyone was really kind and it was a supportive environment.

1l8o14k,https://www.reddit.com/r/yummyrecipesyum/comments/1l8o14k/the_ancient_pink_salt_trick_thats_revolutionizing/,The Ancient Pink Salt Trick That's Revolutionizing Modern Wellness,"Hey everyone! I've been seeing a lot of buzz about the **Pink Salt Trick Recipe for Weight Loss** lately, and after trying it myself for a few weeks, I thought I'd share what I've learned. This isn't some miracle cure or anything crazy, but it's actually a pretty interesting approach that combines traditional wellness practices with modern nutritional understanding.

**What Makes This Different**

So the **Pink Salt Trick Recipe** isn't just about adding pink salt to your water and calling it a day. There's actually a specific method that involves timing, preparation, and the right combination of ingredients that work together to support your metabolism. I was skeptical at first (aren't we all?), but the science behind mineral balance and hydration actually makes sense.

The key thing I noticed is that this approach focuses on supporting your body's natural processes rather than forcing some dramatic change. When I started following the **Pink Salt Trick Recipe for Weight Loss**, I felt more energized and less bloated, which honestly was enough to keep me going.

👉 *Curious to try this at home? Here's the full recipe:* [https://www.amgroyal.com/pink-salt-trick/](https://www.amgroyal.com/pink-salt-trick/)

**The Quality Factor - This Actually Matters**

Here's something I learned the hard way: not all pink salt is created equal. I initially grabbed some cheap stuff from the grocery store and wondered why I wasn't seeing results. Turns out, the mineral profile and purity level can vary dramatically between brands.

Authentic Himalayan pink salt contains over 80 trace minerals that your body needs for optimal function. The cheaper versions often lack these essential minerals or contain additives that can actually work against what you're trying to achieve. I ended up investing in a higher-quality source, and the difference was noticeable within a few days.

The same goes for the other ingredients in the **Pink Salt Trick Recipe**. Fresh, organic components seem to make a real difference in both taste and effectiveness. It's like the difference between cooking with fresh herbs versus dried ones - technically the same thing, but the results speak for themselves.

**Getting the Texture Right - The Secret Nobody Talks About**

This is where most people mess up, and I definitely did at first. There's a specific technique for achieving the perfect consistency that makes all the difference in absorption and taste. It's not just about mixing everything together and hoping for the best.

The texture should be smooth but not too diluted, with just the right amount of natural grittiness from the salt crystals. When done correctly, it almost has this slightly creamy quality that coats your mouth in a pleasant way. Too thick and it's hard to drink; too thin and you lose the beneficial properties.

Temperature also plays a role here. Room temperature seems to work best for maintaining the integrity of the minerals while ensuring everything dissolves properly. I tried it with hot water once and it completely changed the taste profile - not in a good way.

**A Bit of History That's Actually Cool**

The **Pink Salt Trick Recipe for Weight Loss** actually has roots in ancient Ayurvedic practices. For thousands of years, practitioners have understood that mineral balance is crucial for maintaining healthy body weight and energy levels. They used natural salts not just for flavor, but as medicine.

What's fascinating is that modern research is now backing up a lot of what these traditional systems have known all along. The relationship between proper hydration, mineral balance, and metabolic function is becoming clearer through scientific studies.

**My Personal Experience**

I'll be honest - I wasn't expecting much when I first tried the **Pink Salt Trick Recipe**. I've been down the rabbit hole of weight loss trends before, and most of them left me disappointed and a few dollars poorer.

But this felt different from day one. Instead of that jittery, artificial energy you get from some supplements, this gave me a steady, natural boost. My cravings for sugary snacks decreased noticeably, and I found myself drinking more water throughout the day without even thinking about it.

The biggest change was in my morning routine. I used to drag myself out of bed and need coffee immediately. Now I start with this recipe, and I actually feel awake and alert much faster. It's become as automatic as brushing my teeth.

**Things to Keep in Mind**

While the **Pink Salt Trick Recipe for Weight Loss** has worked well for me, everyone's body is different. What I appreciate most is that it's not about restricting foods or forcing dramatic changes. It's more about supporting your body's natural balance and seeing what happens.

Start slowly if you decide to try it. Your body needs time to adjust to any new routine, even something as simple as this. Pay attention to how you feel and adjust accordingly.

The recipe itself is surprisingly simple once you get the hang of it, but the details matter. Taking the time to source quality ingredients and follow the method properly makes all the difference between success and just drinking expensive salt water.

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

We ended up talking and I think a couple days later her step sister got around to talking to madysen and madysen unblocked me and was happy to know I still cared about her and was all like ""so i heard you were asking about me"". A VERY VERY important detail about this was right after she blocked me her dad had died and madysen called me saying she didn't know what to do and she was just driving around, I didn't do the best job of comforting her, all I said was i was sorry and she could come over which she didn't. But her step sister ended up talking to her and I felt awful for her at work, really made me sad thinking about what happened. Also a couple days before I got blocked and her dad died, Madysen was with me and we called him on the phone something he said to me was ""Hope your taking good care of her"", which to this day I never forgot and still think about I think this was back in February or march. Madysen ended up messaging me and admitting she wore my sweatshirt because she missed me and it smelled like me, which was adorable. She did this week without hanging out thing again than I called her and basically set strong boundaries with her saying she needed to try harder and not let petty excuses get in the way of us seeing eachother and I got her to admit she cared and so she genuinely tried the next week and it worked but she slowly fell back into the same habit because I gave up and didn't reinforce what I had said. Every time we hung out was past 1 am and we just fell asleep together because I worked night shifts and that was when I was free. I really didn't like this.

**Things went really south**

At a certain point we hadn't hung out for two weeks and i met up with her and went to a movie with her and afterwards had her meet me back at my apartment so i could give her a necklace, she had told me she was sick and I said I didn't care (90% she was lying) we hung out everything was ok she looked a little off but was happy after I gave her the necklace and stuff. The next couple of days were really weird. She ended up messaging and tell me she didn't want to be together and I was a rebound for some other guy she was into but never hung out with in person and bla bla bla than I retaliated and explained my view on our relationship and wasn't going to give up, she went along with it and conceded essentially. I told her to give me a list of everything she wanted in a man and she already had one coincidently and I made a doc and spent like four hours explaining what kind of man i was under each category and I sent it to her later that night. I was showing I could do it and commit.

She looked at it didn't say anything for a day than I did a follow up and she was all mad I took a day to double text, I think that night she drank a bunch and messaged me throughout the entire night going over relationship questions like bounderies and what we liked about eachother and she admitted she really liked me and had to act like she didn't or something and was liked ""oops i wasn't supposed to say that"" I think she deleted it later.

The next couple of days were even weirder I think she ended up doing the same thing saying she didn't think we should date but then agreed to work things out and sent me a relationship post the next day blabla bla than a couple days later she didn't respond to me at all and I got all needy messaging her over and over and she blocked me. I found out through her step sister she had met up with the guy she had been into they made out and stuff and he gave her hickies. Madysen sent pictures to the group chat with her step sister and her step sister said ""ouu is that from Ethan"" she responded and said ""No from jacob"" I had messaged her step sister to find out what happened and she told me everything. Madysen had left one channel of communication open on tiktok and so I messaged her acting as if I didn't know at first and she tried playing off the end of our relationship like she didn't care about me anymore and said ""theres no way your this obsessed"" keep in mind we'd been together a couple months. I gave it a bit and wasn't gonna say anything about her cheating because I didn't want her to know I spoke to her stepsister but I started progressively getting more and more upset with myself and her and spent the night writing a long ass paragraph calling her out. I sent it and she tried defending herself and justifying what she did and nitpicking me, I didn't believe in any of the nitpicking obviously. She blocked me long story short and I spent the next month listening to relationship audiobooks and learning to get her back, I ended up becoming good friends with her step sister and we hung out and talked about her a bunch. I didn't know how but in my head I was gonna get her back.

I put my tiktok on private and Madysen had kept viewing my profile, eventually i went public and she unblocked me completely. I didn't try and talk to her for the rest of the month and was about to give up thinking about her than her aunt somehow had my number and messaged me saying madysen talked about me a lot and felt aweful about what happened and was upset all the time and guilty like always. I chose to reach out to her because I stopped viewing her as a monster after this, obviously what happened was the guy she got with blocked her for the second time he was some marine. I talked to madysen off and on for the last month it was very slow and tedious getting her to build comfort.

**We hangout again**

We eventually hung out again and she was super awkward and quiet, we went on a hike and I got her to come back to my apartment she didn't want to, She wanted to go hangout downtown I agreed but got her to come in first and park at my apartment. She agreed but we never went down town. I spent like two hours making her smile and telling her to stop being awkward and she was laughing so much and when she tried leaving I wouldn't let her and she loved it and i tickled her and stuff but eventually I let her go. She said she’d call me that night and we could hangout soon possibly the next day. She sent me a message and got my number back from me and i responded than she never texted me back that night….”ummm ok”. The next day I waited no response, I messaged and said maybe I’ll just hangout with one of my other girlfriends tonight (yawning emoji). Her response was ok have fun be safe and she was all passive aggressive with me and I said I’ll just give you space, I was only joking with her even though unfortunately there was some truth to it which I felt bad about, it was only because I was trying not to give her all my energy. 

**Weird communication**

It was weird talking to her after this for like a month but I sent a reel that said you have a beautiful smile and she called me the next morning for a sec and showed me she dyed her hair. She agreed to call later and I tried and no answer and then no response. I tried planning to hangout with her on a specific day and she said it depends on what time and she kind of talked to me like we were gonna ended being like around 8 work? And she talked to me like she was going to than ended up saying she was at a party. I had put off hanging out with a different girl that day for her and it through me off for good with that other girl so I set a mini boundary with her and told her she should have let me know what she was doing. She opened and no response (meaning she was anxious trust me i know her). A couple days later messaged and said “Hey you're welcome to come over tuesday just let me know ahead of time. NO RESPONSE for two days but she read it. Guess what I was thinking to myself there's no way she doesn’t message me before then and it was the night before tuesday when I was driving home i was having this thought and I intentionally left my phone at home while at work as I usually do. I got home and she spam called me four times and sent and unsent a message than added my snap back. I messaged and said “are you up still? No response but i saw she was active on tiktok. I was on tiktok looking for a reel to send her for a while and she kept going off and on and I found one, I was trying to reassure her and make things not weird so I sent a reel that said “im not sure what the future holds but I want to figure it out with you” she immediately opened tiktok back up and blocked me also after I sent my message I forgot to mention she unadded my snap friend request which i was gonna accept in the morning so i didn’t seem needy. I’ve been blocked for over a week on everything, phone and imessage also. I messaged her aunt asking if I could call her and explain what happened and maybe she could talk to madysen and her aunt agreed sounding concerned for us but the next day her aunt never responded again its been a week that was like tuesday the day after the block. I even tried calling the aunt and it said “caller is not available right now” so obviously madysen talked to her. 

**My behavior over the last week**

I’ve been extremely reckless and my buddy drove to the ocean which is three hours away after I spent the whole day driving for hours with my other friend whos a girl. We drove to the ocean and drank. He was drinking and driving but hes good at it and has a high tolerance although I know thats still dangerous. I drank and I never drink I felt pretty optimistic about talking to the aunt the next day. We stayed up all through the night and this indian dude tried to call the cops on us for drinking at night and driving. We got back and the aunt never responded on day 3 of being blocked. I went to the strip club a couple days later and drank with my friend and we argued at night, I’ve been hella overspending, I’ve felt awful everyday and unmotivated even though I would focus on other stuff before being blocked. I’ve been trying to message and call her step sister but she’s been hella distracted and even just so happened to go to a cabin for a couple days normally Im able to talk to her and call, she agreed to twice in one day but then didn’t answer and still hasn’t gotten back to me since yesterday. I even told her im anxious. I’ve genuinely been so anxious guys I learned I'm a lot more attached to this girl emotionally than I thought I even drank two and a half glasses of wine last night with my friends on the phone and got super drunk but the buzz was horrible mostly. Also like I said I don’t drink.

**Moving forward?**

Guys in my head I love this girl and my anxiety has been so I high I wanted to date her again so I could set firmer boundaries and make the relationship work this time after listening to audio books on women and understanding what I was doing wrong before, I never got to that point and like I said im super anxious and just wondering if shes gonna come back again or what I did wrong or why she blocked me again. I really care about her and I know she cared about me otherwise she wouldn’t have done this. Will she come back likely? Also keep in mind this is my longest anything with a girl before this my longest was like a month max. Also guys I know your all gonna be like move on but the truth is I wouldn’t have committed so much time and energy into this girl if thats truly what I wanted and I get no benefit from giving up especially if I don’t fully know why she blocked me. Can you guys give me some decent advice to help me stop being anxious but still keep the door open with her. I haven’t had that call with her step sister sense right after madysen blocked me which i forgot to mention but i’ve been trying to talk to her again and asked if we could hangout soon, i'm waiting for her to get back.And yes im obsessed with her but only because I really care about her. I tried also leaving her a voicemail explaining everything even though i was blocked it let me not sure if it went through though. Is there hope guys? Also I’d rather suffer trying than give up and be back where I started.

Despite the significant progress made by DINO-X in the field of object detection, the ability of current object detection models, including DINO-X, to precisely identify specific individuals based on natural language descriptions—known as Referring Expression Comprehension (REC)—remains considerably inadequate. To enhance the capabilities of object detection models in the REC domain, researchers decided to focus on a widely applicable scenario—humans—as a breakthrough point to experiment with and explore future improvement directions for REC in object detection models.

While computer vision has long focused on detecting and recognizing objects in images, humans remain the core subjects in most real-world applications. Traditional REC methods primarily concentrate on one-to-one references, essentially limiting you to saying ""find the person wearing red"" rather than ""find all people wearing red."" This limitation fails to reflect real-life situations where we often need to identify multiple people matching the same description. For example, finding ""all students wearing uniforms"" in a school group photo, or identifying ""all guests holding drinks"" in a party photo.

[Figure 1 The annotation process for the HumanRef dataset. The process involves: \(a\) pseudo labeling, \(b\) writing property lists, \(c\) assigning properties to each person, and \(d\) transferring to referring style using an LLM.](https://preview.redd.it/vtkson1mk96f1.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab59980b1c8684c18b986530bf7fe205673ee6b)

Researchers from the International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA) and South China University of Technology (SCUT) addressed this gap by introducing a new approach called ""Referring to Any Person."" They redefined the REC task to align better with natural human language habits, developed a dataset specifically for human identification, and created RexSeek, an advanced model that combines visual detection with language understanding, thereby laying the foundation for the birth of DINO-XSeek.

**II. Redefining REC**

Imagine the following scenario: You and a friend are looking at a photo from a music festival, and you might say, ""Find all people wearing sunglasses on the left side of the stage,"" or ""Point out all members of a certain band in the photo."" Existing technology struggles to handle these seemingly simple requests because current REC methods have several key limitations:

1. One-to-one referring: Most existing models assume each referring expression corresponds to only a single object. They can answer questions like ""Who is the class monitor?"" but cannot address questions like ""Who are the members of the class committee?"" which refer to multiple people, contradicting real-world usage patterns.

2. Limited scope: Current datasets focus on simple attributes or spatial relationships, ignoring the complexity of human descriptions. Existing systems excel at identifying ""the person wearing red"" but struggle to understand complex descriptions like ""people who look happy"" or ""young people talking to elderly individuals.""

3. No rejection capability: Existing models often fail to recognize when described people are not present in an image, leading to hallucinations. If you ask, ""Find the astronaut in the photo,"" and the photo shows a family gathering, existing systems tend to incorrectly designate someone rather than honestly answering ""there is no astronaut.""

To address these issues, the paper introduces the concept of ""Referring to Any Person,"" which encompasses five description modes commonly used in real-world scenarios:

1. Attributes: Including physical features, clothing, and accessories, such as ""the blonde-haired, blue-eyed person,"" ""the man wearing glasses and a suit,"" or ""the woman with a red handbag.""

2. Position: Spatial relationships and positions, such as ""the person standing next to the window,"" ""the singer at the center of the stage,"" or ""the students sitting in the last row.""

3. Interaction: Behaviors and relationships with other people or objects, such as ""parents taking photos of their child,"" ""employees shaking hands with the CEO,"" or ""two people talking to each other.""

4. Reasoning: Reasoning based on context or combinations of features, such as ""the person who appears to be the host of this family,"" ""the person who seems to be the team leader.""

5. Celebrity recognition: Identifying well-known figures, such as ""Tom Cruise in the photo"" or ""Bill Gates in the front row.""

This redefinition enables computer vision systems to handle three key functions:

1. Multi-instance referring: The ability to identify all individuals matching a description, such as finding ""all people wearing black clothes,"" not just one of them.

2. Multi-instance discrimination: The ability to distinguish between different groups of people, such as differentiating between ""students on the right"" and ""teachers on the left.""

3. Rejecting non-existence: The ability to recognize when described individuals are not present, such as honestly answering ""no one matches this description"" when asked to ""find the astronaut in the photo"" when there are no astronauts.

This redefinition transforms REC from a simple one-to-one mapping to a more nuanced and practical task, aligning with natural human communication patterns and greatly expanding the practicality of computer vision.

**III. The HumanRef Dataset**

To train systems capable of understanding complex human descriptions, the research team created the HumanRef dataset—essentially a textbook for teaching machines to ""understand human descriptions,"" containing 7,302 images and 103,028 referring expressions.

[Figure 2 Distribution of people per image \(left\) and ground truth boxes per referring expression \(right\) in the HumanRef dataset.](https://preview.redd.it/1wogicdqk96f1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=c79cfa80f720750472ef05924e49e95cba9398a0)

The dataset was constructed through a three-step annotation process:

1. Property listing: Determining relevant properties that can be used to refer to people, such as ""lady, short hair, wearing a yellow dress, standing at the doorway"";

2. Property assignment: Interactively assigning properties to each person in the image;

3. Referring style rewriting: Using a large language model to convert attribute lists into natural referring expressions.

Researchers deliberately selected scenes with larger numbers of people (averaging 9.6 people per image) to ensure the dataset covers various complex situations. This differs significantly from previous datasets, which were like teaching machines to recognize only individual objects, whereas HumanRef teaches machines to understand complex human descriptions and group identification.

**IV. RexSeek Architecture**

To understand RexSeek, imagine it as an assistant with super-strong vision and language comprehension abilities. When you say, ""Find all children wearing hats in the photo,"" what would this assistant do? The RexSeek architecture and workflow are as follows:

1. Visual Encoder: Processes visual information from the input image, understanding the overall content;

2. Person Detector(DINO-X): Identifies all individuals in the image and provides bounding boxes;

3. Large Language Model(Qwen 2.5): Interprets referring expressions and matches them with detected individuals, understanding the specific meaning of descriptions like ""children wearing hats"";

4. Specialized Token System: Includes grounding tokens, object tokens, and object index tokens to connect language descriptions with visual elements.

[Figure 3 The RexSeek model architecture, showing the integration of vision encoders, person detector, and language model with specialized tokens for object referencing.](https://preview.redd.it/7x94ybstk96f1.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf98c25d2551b057ffc8f65ad05d35478eb68eb1)

The model processes both the image and the referring expression simultaneously, then outputs the indices of all detected individuals matching the description. If no matches are found, the model can identify and indicate the absence of matching individuals. Unlike previous approaches that primarily focused on detection or heavily relied on language models, RexSeek achieves a balanced integration of both capabilities. This integration is crucial for handling the complexity of human-centered references, where both visual accuracy and language understanding are essential.

**V. Training Method**

The development of RexSeek involves a carefully designed multi-stage training method to build perception and understanding capabilities, including:

1. Modality Alignment: Initial training using image-captioning data to align visual and textual modalities;

2. Perception Training: Enhancing detection capabilities using detection-oriented data;

3. General Understanding: Incorporating multimodal data to improve overall comprehension;

4. Task-Specific Fine-tuning: Final refinement using the HumanRef dataset.

Researchers found that this multi-stage approach significantly outperforms traditional training methods, enabling the model to establish strong foundations in both visual perception and language understanding before specializing in human-centered referring expression tasks.

**VI. Model Performance**

In HumanRef benchmark evaluations, RexSeek demonstrated significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models. Experiments revealed several key findings:

1. Superior performance on multi-instance referring: While most existing models' performance drops sharply as the number of target individuals increases, RexSeek maintains high precision and recall across all scenarios.

Figure 4 Precision and recall performance of various models based on the number of instances per referring expression. RexSeek maintains performance across all scenarios, while other models deteriorate with increasing instances.

2. Effective rejection capability: Unlike other models that tend to hallucinate when referred people do not exist, RexSeek successfully identifies non-existent cases.

3. Strong generalization: Despite being primarily trained for human identification, RexSeek can also understand instructions like ""find the dog in the photo"" or ""point out the coffee cup on the table,"" demonstrating its universal adaptability.

4. Balanced precision and recall: RexSeek performs excellently in both accuracy (not misidentifying people) and comprehensiveness (not missing eligible people).

These results validate the researchers' approach to redefining the referring task and highlight the effectiveness of their model architecture and training strategy. RexSeek significantly outperforms existing models on all subsets of the HumanRef benchmark, especially in challenging scenarios involving multiple instances and rejection cases.

**VII. Application Scenarios**

RexSeek's technological breakthroughs open up possibilities for numerous practical applications that will change how we interact with the digital world, including:

1. Human-robot interaction: Enabling robots to understand natural language instructions about people in their environment;

2. Visual search systems: Allowing users to search for specific individuals in photo collections using natural language;

3. Security and surveillance: Identifying persons of interest based on verbal descriptions;

4. Assistive technologies: Helping visually impaired individuals understand who is present in images;

5. Content analysis: Automating the identification of people in media for content moderation and organization.

**Conclusion**

RexSeek's research represents a qualitative leap forward by redefining how systems identify and locate individuals based on natural language descriptions, bringing machines closer to how humans understand the visual world—evolving from recognizing only single objects to understanding complex scenes with multiple instances.

As this technology develops, we anticipate computer vision systems will increasingly naturally understand the human world, not just seeing people but more profoundly comprehending the complex relationships between objects across various dimensions of human existence. This computer vision capability will make technology more intuitive and naturally integrated into our lives.

Hi so I am 20 years old and I've talked to my now ex girlfriend over the course of 9 months. We started off talking on snapchat after I randomly added her and she was always weird off and on than I would message her again, like she'd be all energetic and flirty with me than be all passive aggressive and avoidant with me through text for no apparent reason. Eventually we got to the point where we agreed to hangout and everything was fine. We met up at a starbucks early in the morning I bought a coffee she has a social anxiety thing where she's too afraid to drink or eat in front of people so I was the only one that drank a coffee. We had a great conversation and talked about playing monopoly she was was so cute lol. We had agreed to try and hangout again after that and so I think a day or two later we hungout, I picked her up and we went to lookout point and she was so nervous and cute. She was too nervous to cuddle or anything so I made the initiative and made sure she was comfortable. Basically we just kept hanging out from here. She would have me come pick her up or we would hangout at her aunts all this over the course of like three months.

**Where things started getting rocky**

She ended up getting into this bad habit where we wouldn't hangout for like a week and it started bothering me. I ended up saying something like ""Are you sure your ready for a relationship right now..."" and some paragraph, she agreed with me and I think blocked me or something but she wasn't mad at me or against being with me necessarily which I learned. I wasn't as attached to her at this point but to me this felt underwhelming and I wasn't ok with it so basically I knew her step sister was in my entrepreneur class because when I had met her madysen stopped by at my work with her to say hi and we were talking and found out because I looked familiar. So me knowing that I went and messaged her step sister through our class online portal and to my surprise she responded and gave me her number to talk about madysen.

We ended up talking and I think a couple days later her step sister got around to talking to madysen and madysen unblocked me and was happy to know I still cared about her and was all like ""so i heard you were asking about me"". A VERY VERY important detail about this was right after she blocked me her dad had died and madysen called me saying she didn't know what to do and she was just driving around, I didn't do the best job of comforting her, all I said was i was sorry and she could come over which she didn't. But her step sister ended up talking to her and I felt awful for her at work, really made me sad thinking about what happened. Also a couple days before I got blocked and her dad died, Madysen was with me and we called him on the phone something he said to me was ""Hope your taking good care of her"", which to this day I never forgot and still think about I think this was back in February or march. Madysen ended up messaging me and admitting she wore my sweatshirt because she missed me and it smelled like me, which was adorable. She did this week without hanging out thing again than I called her and basically set strong boundaries with her saying she needed to try harder and not let petty excuses get in the way of us seeing eachother and I got her to admit she cared and so she genuinely tried the next week and it worked but she slowly fell back into the same habit because I gave up and didn't reinforce what I had said. Every time we hung out was past 1 am and we just fell asleep together because I worked night shifts and that was when I was free. I really didn't like this.

**Things went really south**

At a certain point we hadn't hung out for two weeks and i met up with her and went to a movie with her and afterwards had her meet me back at my apartment so i could give her a necklace, she had told me she was sick and I said I didn't care (90% she was lying) we hung out everything was ok she looked a little off but was happy after I gave her the necklace and stuff. The next couple of days were really weird. She ended up messaging and tell me she didn't want to be together and I was a rebound for some other guy she was into but never hung out with in person and bla bla bla than I retaliated and explained my view on our relationship and wasn't going to give up, she went along with it and conceded essentially. I told her to give me a list of everything she wanted in a man and she already had one coincidently and I made a doc and spent like four hours explaining what kind of man i was under each category and I sent it to her later that night. I was showing I could do it and commit.

She looked at it didn't say anything for a day than I did a follow up and she was all mad I took a day to double text, I think that night she drank a bunch and messaged me throughout the entire night going over relationship questions like bounderies and what we liked about eachother and she admitted she really liked me and had to act like she didn't or something and was liked ""oops i wasn't supposed to say that"" I think she deleted it later.

The next couple of days were even weirder I think she ended up doing the same thing saying she didn't think we should date but then agreed to work things out and sent me a relationship post the next day blabla bla than a couple days later she didn't respond to me at all and I got all needy messaging her over and over and she blocked me. I found out through her step sister she had met up with the guy she had been into they made out and stuff and he gave her hickies. Madysen sent pictures to the group chat with her step sister and her step sister said ""ouu is that from Ethan"" she responded and said ""No from jacob"" I had messaged her step sister to find out what happened and she told me everything. Madysen had left one channel of communication open on tiktok and so I messaged her acting as if I didn't know at first and she tried playing off the end of our relationship like she didn't care about me anymore and said ""theres no way your this obsessed"" keep in mind we'd been together a couple months. I gave it a bit and wasn't gonna say anything about her cheating because I didn't want her to know I spoke to her stepsister but I started progressively getting more and more upset with myself and her and spent the night writing a long ass paragraph calling her out. I sent it and she tried defending herself and justifying what she did and nitpicking me, I didn't believe in any of the nitpicking obviously. She blocked me long story short and I spent the next month listening to relationship audiobooks and learning to get her back, I ended up becoming good friends with her step sister and we hung out and talked about her a bunch. I didn't know how but in my head I was gonna get her back.

I put my tiktok on private and Madysen had kept viewing my profile, eventually i went public and she unblocked me completely. I didn't try and talk to her for the rest of the month and was about to give up thinking about her than her aunt somehow had my number and messaged me saying madysen talked about me a lot and felt aweful about what happened and was upset all the time and guilty like always. I chose to reach out to her because I stopped viewing her as a monster after this, obviously what happened was the guy she got with blocked her for the second time he was some marine. I talked to madysen off and on for the last month it was very slow and tedious getting her to build comfort.

**We hangout again**

We eventually hung out again and she was super awkward and quiet, we went on a hike and I got her to come back to my apartment she didn't want to, She wanted to go hangout downtown I agreed but got her to come in first and park at my apartment. She agreed but we never went down town. I spent like two hours making her smile and telling her to stop being awkward and she was laughing so much and when she tried leaving I wouldn't let her and she loved it and i tickled her and stuff but eventually I let her go. She said she’d call me that night and we could hangout soon possibly the next day. She sent me a message and got my number back from me and i responded than she never texted me back that night….”ummm ok”. The next day I waited no response, I messaged and said maybe I’ll just hangout with one of my other girlfriends tonight (yawning emoji). Her response was ok have fun be safe and she was all passive aggressive with me and I said I’ll just give you space, I was only joking with her even though unfortunately there was some truth to it which I felt bad about, it was only because I was trying not to give her all my energy. 

**Weird communication**

It was weird talking to her after this for like a month but I sent a reel that said you have a beautiful smile and she called me the next morning for a sec and showed me she dyed her hair. She agreed to call later and I tried and no answer and then no response. I tried planning to hangout with her on a specific day and she said it depends on what time and she kind of talked to me like we were gonna ended being like around 8 work? And she talked to me like she was going to than ended up saying she was at a party. I had put off hanging out with a different girl that day for her and it through me off for good with that other girl so I set a mini boundary with her and told her she should have let me know what she was doing. She opened and no response (meaning she was anxious trust me i know her). A couple days later messaged and said “Hey you're welcome to come over tuesday just let me know ahead of time. NO RESPONSE for two days but she read it. Guess what I was thinking to myself there's no way she doesn’t message me before then and it was the night before tuesday when I was driving home i was having this thought and I intentionally left my phone at home while at work as I usually do. I got home and she spam called me four times and sent and unsent a message than added my snap back. I messaged and said “are you up still? No response but i saw she was active on tiktok. I was on tiktok looking for a reel to send her for a while and she kept going off and on and I found one, I was trying to reassure her and make things not weird so I sent a reel that said “im not sure what the future holds but I want to figure it out with you” she immediately opened tiktok back up and blocked me also after I sent my message I forgot to mention she unadded my snap friend request which i was gonna accept in the morning so i didn’t seem needy. I’ve been blocked for over a week on everything, phone and imessage also. I messaged her aunt asking if I could call her and explain what happened and maybe she could talk to madysen and her aunt agreed sounding concerned for us but the next day her aunt never responded again its been a week that was like tuesday the day after the block. I even tried calling the aunt and it said “caller is not available right now” so obviously madysen talked to her. 

**My behavior over the last week**

I’ve been extremely reckless and my buddy drove to the ocean which is three hours away after I spent the whole day driving for hours with my other friend whos a girl. We drove to the ocean and drank. He was drinking and driving but hes good at it and has a high tolerance although I know thats still dangerous. I drank and I never drink I felt pretty optimistic about talking to the aunt the next day. We stayed up all through the night and this indian dude tried to call the cops on us for drinking at night and driving. We got back and the aunt never responded on day 3 of being blocked. I went to the strip club a couple days later and drank with my friend and we argued at night, I’ve been hella overspending, I’ve felt awful everyday and unmotivated even though I would focus on other stuff before being blocked. I’ve been trying to message and call her step sister but she’s been hella distracted and even just so happened to go to a cabin for a couple days normally Im able to talk to her and call, she agreed to twice in one day but then didn’t answer and still hasn’t gotten back to me since yesterday. I even told her im anxious. I’ve genuinely been so anxious guys I learned I'm a lot more attached to this girl emotionally than I thought I even drank two and a half glasses of wine last night with my friends on the phone and got super drunk but the buzz was horrible mostly. Also like I said I don’t drink.

**Moving forward?**

Guys in my head I love this girl and my anxiety has been so I high I wanted to date her again so I could set firmer boundaries and make the relationship work this time after listening to audio books on women and understanding what I was doing wrong before, I never got to that point and like I said im super anxious and just wondering if shes gonna come back again or what I did wrong or why she blocked me again. I really care about her and I know she cared about me otherwise she wouldn’t have done this. Will she come back likely? Also keep in mind this is my longest anything with a girl before this my longest was like a month max. Also guys I know your all gonna be like move on but the truth is I wouldn’t have committed so much time and energy into this girl if thats truly what I wanted and I get no benefit from giving up especially if I don’t fully know why she blocked me. Can you guys give me some decent advice to help me stop being anxious but still keep the door open with her. I haven’t had that call with her step sister sense right after madysen blocked me which i forgot to mention but i’ve been trying to talk to her again and asked if we could hangout soon, i'm waiting for her to get back.And yes im obsessed with her but only because I really care about her. I tried also leaving her a voicemail explaining everything even though i was blocked it let me not sure if it went through though. Is there hope guys? Also I’d rather suffer trying than give up and be back where I started.

---

ACT 1: The Setup — Late Night at STAR Labs

It’s been a long week. Barry’s been running non-stop, Caitlin has been buried under medical scans, experiments, and the shadow of her own alter ego — Killer Frost. Tonight, the team has gone home early, leaving Caitlin and Barry alone in the quiet lab.

Caitlin is trying to unwind. She finds a forgotten bottle of red wine in the fridge, something Cisco probably left behind after a late-night celebration. On impulse, she pours a glass. One glass turns into two as she sits curled up on the couch, sipping and scrolling through Barry’s old photo albums on the computer.

She’s giggling quietly at an embarrassing picture of Barry with a messy pancake breakfast face, and the loneliness that sometimes creeps in is softened by the alcohol and memories.

Barry walks in after a patrol, weary but glad to find Caitlin there.

Barry: “Hey Caitlin, didn’t expect to see you here this late.”

Caitlin: (playfully) “Oh, I’m just doing some highly scientific research on the emotional effects of wine and old photos. Spoiler alert: you’re ridiculously cute.”

Barry grins and sits beside her. Caitlin, already tipsy, leans into him.

Caitlin: “You know… I’m a doctor. I’m supposed to keep people alive. But honestly, you keep me alive more than any medicine.”

Barry looks at her, surprised by the honesty in her voice.


---

ACT 2: The Drunken Confessions

Caitlin’s words turn into a flowing river of playful, silly, and surprisingly sincere confessions.

She tries to imitate Barry’s running stance but stumbles and nearly falls into the couch.

She attempts to make a toast but accidentally spills cocoa on her lap, laughing it off.

She tells Barry how she once tried to phase through a wall and ended up with a bruised nose—“But if you kissed it better, I’d try it again,” she slurs.

She confesses her fear that Killer Frost’s coldness will one day push him away, but tonight, with a glass of wine, she feels brave enough to say she’s scared to lose him.


Barry listens, his heart growing heavier and lighter all at once. He gently reassures her that no matter what, he’s not going anywhere.


---

ACT 3: The Tension

Suddenly, Caitlin’s phone rings — it’s Cisco. He needs her help with a critical medical emergency involving a metahuman.

Caitlin’s face falls. She wants to stay, to keep sharing this moment with Barry, but the duty calls.

Barry offers to go with her.

In the ambulance ride, Caitlin starts to come down from the tipsy euphoria, reality creeping back in. The weight of her responsibilities and the danger they face together presses heavily.

At the hospital, they work seamlessly as a team, saving the metahuman patient. Barry watches Caitlin’s fierce competence and realizes he loves her even more — not just for her silliness, but for her strength.


---

ACT 4: The Resolution — Honest Hearts

Back at STAR Labs, later that night, Caitlin and Barry collapse on the couch, exhausted but alive.

Caitlin, sober now, reaches out and takes Barry’s hand.

Caitlin: “I was silly earlier... but the feelings? Not silly. You mean everything to me. Even when I’m frozen inside, you warm me up.”

Barry squeezes her hand, smiling softly.

Barry: “I love you, Caitlin. Every part of you.”

They lean into each other, the weight of the world momentarily lifted.


---

EPILOGUE: The Morning After

Caitlin wakes up to the soft hum of the lab’s computers and a quiet voice beside her.

Barry is there, coffee in hand, and a mischievous grin.

Barry: “Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. You left a trail of whipped cream and giggles everywhere last night. Also, I might have saved a picture of you calling me ‘lightning muffin.’”

Caitlin groans but laughs, leaning her head on his shoulder.

Caitlin: “You’re impossible.”

Barry: “And you’re adorable.”

I’ve been on omeprazole 20mg and sometimes 40mg daily for about 10 years because I couldn't stop it without severe rebound acidity. I’m also a long-term smoker, drink coffee daily, and eat mostly fast food (I know... I’m working on changing that).

For years, my symptoms were stable — just typical reflux controlled by PPIs. But recently, things have taken a turn. Three days ago, after a big fast-food meal and a stressful day, I started feeling pain in my chest when food passes through my esophagus. It got a bit better the second day, then flared again on the third. It's especially painful when I'm hungry or lying down, and even burping causes pain in the same spot in my chest.

I don’t have:

Difficulty swallowing (the food goes down fine)

Weight loss

Vomiting

Heartburn (PPIs control that)


I do have:

Pain during solid food swallowing

Pain when burping

Slight random chest discomfort (sometimes left side, sometimes right)

No improvement with PPIs so far


Doctors suspect it could be esophageal spasm or something inflammatory like reflux esophagitis or maybe even EoE (eosinophilic esophagitis). I’m scheduled for an endoscopy in about a month, and I’m anxious about waiting this long and afraid that could be tumor causing that.

I’m really looking to hear from anyone who experienced something similar. Did you get a diagnosis? What helped? Could this be something serious even though I don’t have red-flag symptoms like weight loss or vomiting?

Running one profile used to be enough for me, but I hit limits fast. A single account can only sit in so many subreddits, and every niche has its own rules about self-promo. By splitting my presence into separate personas, I can:

* post in finance, tech, and lifestyle subs at the same time;
* speak in the right voice for each crowd (serious in r/marketing, casual in r/sidehustle);
* test headlines, images, and angles without torching one reputation;
* protect myself if a mod or the Reddit spam filter zaps an account for a mistake.

Multiple accounts are allowed as long as you do not vote-train, brigade, or spam. That freedom comes with responsibility, which is what the rest of this guide is about.

# 2. The “Clean IP” Rule You Do Not Want to Break

My first ban wave happened because I logged three alts on the same coffee-shop Wi-Fi. Reddit tied them together by IP and tossed them. Lesson learned:

1. **One account, one IP** whenever possible. I keep a short list of paid residential proxies and stick each account to a “home” address.
2. **No wild hops.** If Account A usually logs in from New York, I do not jump to a Singapore IP thirty minutes later. Sudden geography swings trigger extra CAPTCHA or manual reviews.
3. **Skip public VPNs.** Cheap, overused ranges live on Reddit’s spam watchlists. I would rather pay for low-volume residential IPs than gamble on free nodes.
4. **Periodically audit IP reputation.** I run each address through a free blacklist checker once a month. If it shows up, I rotate to a fresh one before problems start.

# 3. Browser Fingerprints: Your Hidden ID Card

After fixing IPs I still lost two accounts. The culprit: identical browser fingerprints. Reddit’s scripts read data like fonts, screen size, and canvas hash. My solution:

* **Separate browser profiles.** Chrome’s built-in profile switcher and Firefox containers work. For extra safety I use an anti-detect browser for high-value accounts.
* **Match locale to IP.** If the proxy is in the UK, that profile runs in UK English, UK keyboard layout, and correct time zone.
* **No cross-logins.** I never open Account B in Account A’s browser, even for a second. One slip can plant a cookie that links them forever.
* **Regular cleanup.** Every few weeks I clear cache and LocalStorage for each profile, then log back in, so long-term tracking bits cannot pile up.

# 4. Building Real History and Karma, One Comment at a Time

Contributor Quality Score (CQS) is Reddit’s under-the-hood trust meter. You cannot see it, but mods and Automoderator use it. I raise CQS like this:

* **Warm-up period.** For ten to fourteen days, a new account does zero promotion. I lurk, up-vote, answer questions, and post fun stuff that fits the sub.
* **Verified email and avatar.** Takes one minute, signals “real human.”
* **Comment karma first, link karma later.** Comments feel safer to other users and usually earn up-votes faster. A hundred comment karma with no downvotes beats a shiny link that sits at zero.
* **Mix of subs.** I join at least five communities per persona. Variety shows natural interests and prevents any one mod team from owning my fate.
* **Slow, steady posting.** One quality post every couple of days beats five low effort drops in an afternoon. Fast bursts look robotic and nuke CQS.

With a month of mild activity, each account holds 300–500 total karma and climbs into better quality tiers. Only then do I risk sharing my own blog post or product link.

# 5. Posting Strategy That Keeps You Under the Radar

**Rule of thumb: 80 percent value, 20 percent self-promo.** If an account makes ten substantial contributions, it “earns” two mild plugs. When I do share my own content I follow four safeguards:

1. **Unique title and text every time.** Even if the target page is identical, I rewrite the headline for the sub’s style so no duplicate filter fires.
2. **Follow local rules.** Some subs ban link posts from users under 1,000 karma or 90 days of age. I track those numbers in a sheet before risking a post.
3. **Engage fast.** I stick around for the first hour after posting, answer questions, thank commenters, and up-vote helpful replies. Interaction shows I am not a drive-by marketer.
4. **Never cross-promote with alts.** No up-votes, no “nice post” comments, no secret brigading. Reddit’s systems catch that pattern and ban the whole network.

For content cadence, I aim for one promotional piece per week across all accounts combined. The rest is pure community building.

# 6. Light Automation That Will Not Get You Flagged

Automation saves time but can absolutely wreck you if overdone. Here is my safe stack:

* **Scheduling only.** I use LaterForReddit or a custom script to queue posts at sub-peak times so I am not awake at 3 AM. The script never comments or votes.
* **Inbox alerts.** A tiny bot pings my phone if an account gets a modmail or reply I miss. Rapid response keeps reputation intact.
* **Data dashboard.** A private spreadsheet pulls karma, post dates, and IP notes so I can see patterns. No API spamming, just a daily snapshot.

What I refuse to automate: commenting, DM outreach, up-voting, or mass account creation. Those actions scream bot, and Reddit introduces fresh counter-measures every year (Captcha3, behavior scoring, etc.). If a task involves talking to people, I do it manually.

# 7. Mistakes That Still Haunt Me

* Copy-pasting the same giveaway link in three subs on launch day. Result: instant moderator bans.
* Forgetting to match time zone to proxy and logging a “California” account from a Berlin clock. Got slapped with back-to-back email verifications.
* Up-voting my own post from an alt, just once. Both accounts shadow-banned within hours. Painful but effective lesson.

Write these on a sticky note. They will save you from repeating my face-palms.

# 8. Quick Maintenance Checklist

* Weekly: check IP status, rotate if blacklisted.
* Bi-weekly: clear cookies, update browser to latest version.
* Monthly: review each account’s promo ratio and karma growth.
* Quarterly: prune dead subs and join new ones that fit the persona’s theme. Fresh communities mean fresh eyeballs.

# 9. Key Takeaways

Managing multiple Reddit accounts takes patience and respect for the platform. Treat every profile as if it is your only one. Keep technical footprints clean, build genuine history before promoting, and remember that Redditors reward value over sales talk. Follow those basics and you can market effectively without feeling the ban hammer.

Never thought I’d be posting something like this, but here goes.
I was living with my partner for over a year—things weren’t perfect, but we had a cozy little setup that felt like home. A couple of days ago, we started watching about the LA riots, and it sparked some seriously heated political arguments. I’m not a huge politics person, but I feel strongly that the riots were a breaking point  on certain issues—too little police force, not enough accountability. My partner saw it differently, arguing the violence and looting didn’t matter to take the protests seriously. What started as late-night debates turned into a a few days of shouting matches. We just couldn’t see eye to eye, and it felt like every conversation built this wall between us.
Then, yesterday, it all fell apart. After another blowout, they told me to get out. I figured it was just anger talking, but when I came back today, the locks were changed. I was gutted—didn’t even get to grab all my stuff. I thought that was the worst of it, but then I got a call from my boss. Apparently, my partner had contacted my work and spun some story about me being “unreliable” and “a mess.” I’d been a barista at this coffee shop for two years—loved the early mornings, the regulars, the smell of coffee—and just like that, I was fired. I still can’t wrap my head around how they could be that vindictive.
Now, I’m crashing on a motel with the little money I have left, but it’s not a long-term thing. I’ve got no job, no home, and I’m running low on options. I’ve been applying to places, but it’s tough without a real address, and I’m still processing the shock of losing everything so fast. I used to spend my days off reading or researching, and now I’m just trying to figure out how to survive. It’s fucked up, and I feel totally betrayed.
I’m posting here hoping someone might have tips for finding housing or a job in New Jersey. I’d also take any advice on dealing with this mess emotionally—maybe someone’s been through something similar? Even just a kind word would mean a lot right now.

1l8ndqe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8ndqe,My fist Botox experience. Dr. Abijou in Myeondong,"I have never gotten Botox before. I am 48 years old and I notice my crows feet are getting deeper. I was on the fence if I was going to pull the trigger. In my 2nd to last day, I finally pulled the trigger. I researched and I wanted to focus on Myeongdong area as this was the closest spot to our hotel.

I chose Dr Abijou although the main comment is it’s like a factory. I sent a WhatsApp message and the person responding was very informative and gave me the price list. On the day of my appointment I checked in and there was a lot of people. They did have a free coffee that a robot makes :). Within 10 minutes I was called for a consultation. A translator escorted me to a room to speak with a consultant. They ask me what I would like to have done and I said crows feet only and chin massiteur which they called Botox of the square chin. There was no upselling. It’s really the face slimming I am after. Once we agreed on the procedures, she ask me what brand of Botox. It range from domestic, premium domestic, German and American brand Botox. I chose the American as this one last the longest. I also paid at this point.  As soon as we are done they took a picture of my face escorted me to a room with the interpreter and a nurse. The doctor came in and examined my eyes by smiling and closing my eyes tight. He made me clench my jaw and he said my right muscle is bigger than the other so he will put more on the right. He did 3 injections each eye. Not painful just a small pinch. The jaw was even better. I barely felt anything. My pain tolerance is slow so that surprised me. 

The doctor probably did all these for 5 minutes. I was escorted to the reception so they can give me my tax free form. This by the way is very easy to redeem. They have a kiosk at the airport and you just scan the receipt and it give the cash immediately 

The result: after 2 days my crows feet is barely noticeable. My chin a slight difference as this should take effect in about a week or 2. All in all the whole process took around 30-45 minutes.

the pain stopped being only in my teeth and now its in my lower jaw, it spread to my ear and gave me an ear ache, and sometimes it hurts behind my eye and my temple.

the pain is unbearable. its usually a 6/10 but right now and the past few days the pain is 9/10. im in constant pain from the moment i wake up until i go to sleep. ive tried ice packs, warm compress, ibuprofen, tylenol, ive tried not drinking coffee, ive tried sleeping with an eye mask, ive tried no screens an hour before bed, ive tried only soft foods, ive tried anything to make my sleep better quality, like i dont even know what to try anymore. i literally started crying today because i feel so helpless and in pain and i just want it to stop

do i just have to live with this pain for the rest of my life? the mouth guard wont help with the pain, will it? its just to prevent me from damaging my teeth. so what am i supposed to do about the pain? :(",1,1749630321.0,bruxism,2,1.0,False

I started by sending a very nice and cute comment on her picture which she enjoyed. 

Then, as I was travelling I directly asked her for a coffee because I was leaving in couple of days. I wasn’t sure about her response but she replied positively by saying that she really wanted to meet but she is out of town to her native place.

After that me and “S” were having a very good conversation which lasted around 2-3 days where I always talked with respect and never said something dirty to her. 

Always kept it cheesy and fun and talked about her favourite places and asked her opinions on different stuff which also had fun elements throughout the conversation.

It also went till a point of sharing memes (through ig) on Hinge app.

She was also involved a lot in the conversation, having laughs and I was feeling it was going in a positive way. So after talking about things I asked on 3rd day “What she is looking for”?

She stopped responding and then unmatched me next morning.

So I was little curious to know did I asked something wrong ? I only wanted to know her intentions.

about a month ago now i adopted a 2 year old tabby. he’s a super sweet boy, OG owners said he was friendly and good with people and other pets, but he has been terrified of me since adoption. we got off to an awful start for a few reasons:
- i asked the original owners if i could meet him first so i wouldn’t be a total stranger to him when i brought him home, but they would only bring him to me in a carrier in a public space. so essentially, he was brought into a strange car with a strange lady and a strange new home, out of nowhere.
- on his first night with me, he cut his paw on something overnight; i have no clue what but it ended up being okay (checked by vet), but i think this scared him and made him feel like this was not a safe new space.
- he wouldn’t eat at all for the first five days, which led to me having to pull him out of his hiding spot and take him to the vet to make sure he was okay— aka the number one thing you are not supposed to do with new cats.

so he’s been hiding ever since i got him, which i know is normal! ever since he started eating regularly i stopped invading his hiding space, which is under my couch. the good news is that he IS eating regularly now after using the appetite stimulants the vets gave me for a day or two. he’s also exploring the apartment when i’m asleep/at work (i have a camera set up). we’ve made huge progress since the beginning, where he wouldn’t even leave his hiding spot under the couch, he’s now exploring when he knows i’m awake but in my bedroom, and even peeking his head out from behind the couch while i’m out in the living room!! i’ve also seen him on the camera playing with his toys while i’m gone, and have caught him sneaking into my bedroom at night to check out me and my room while i sleep.

however, when i come into the same room as him while he’s out, he bolts and goes back to hiding. 

i know everybody will say to be patient, that some cats can take a long time to adjust to a new home, and i’ll be patient for as long as i need to. i’m just worried that i may be doing something wrong here to keep him from being able to trust me.

i do not have any other pets, it’s just me in my apartment, and i try my best to stick to a daily routine with sounds he can get used to hearing at certain times (coffee in the morning, front door shutting when i leave, telling him i’m leaving his food out when i go to bed at night, etc.) 

does it sound like we’re on the right path and i just need to hold out for a little while longer? or am i doing something wrong?

Chapter 1  
  
The rain pelted against the balcony windows, washing away the gloom that had settled in my heart.  
  
""So... how about we set the wedding for three days from now? Is that ok ?""  
  
I paused for a moment. ""Alright.""  
  
""Three days then. Wait for me at County Clerk’s Office, and don't forget your ID.""  
  
......  
  
After hanging up, I pulled out a wet wipe and carefully cleaned my ID card.  
  
The image of Thorne casually tossing it onto the garbage can lid earlier kept replaying in my mind—a stark reminder that he didn't give a damn about my feelings. Our wedding meant nothing to him.  
  
So he could use any excuse, anytime, to postpone our plans to get married.  
  
First it was his bachelor parties, then seven different exes getting pregnant and I had to clean up his damn messes, and now waiting for Cressida to safely deliver their babies...  
  
I sighed, a bitter taste rising in my throat.  
  
It has been eleven years,I thought this shameful crush that started in my teens could finally come to light today, that fifteen-year-old Thorne and Vesper could finally get their happy ending. But no...  
  
A cold breeze hit my eyes, making them sting, and tears spilled over.  
  
The butler walked in stone-faced, setting a tablet in front of me with a video call already running.  
  
Thorne's face filled the screen, still wearing that satisfied smile.  
  
As the camera tilted, following his gaze, I caught a glimpse of pink fabric draped over his hand, veins visible beneath the skin.  
  
I looked away, my voice catching. ""What do you want?""  
  
Thorne's expression shifted, the smile disappearing as he turned the camera toward a pile of stuff on the floor.  
  
""Cressida doesn't really like these things. I'm gonna get rid of them. You want any of it? I can have someone drop it off at your place.""  
  
I studied each item in that heap.  
  
A ceramic mug —from the first birthday Thorne ever celebrated with me,at that expensive pottery studio where we made them together.  
  
A silver lace wedding dress, the showstopper of the auction—Thorne had paid a fortune for it at an overseas bridal auction.When it arrived, I'd never seen him look so happy，""You're going to look absolutely stunning in this at our wedding.""  
  
There were also the toys we'd made together, the balloons we'd tied, the decorative dolls we'd ordered for the bed...  
  
All these things I'd treasured, now scattered on the ground like garbage.  
  
My heart sank deeper and deeper.  
  
Before I could respond, Cressida suddenly popped into video.  
  
She leaned against Thorne, her words dripping with fake casualness.  
  
""So Thorne wasn't lying—Vesper's taste really is... questionable. I mean, who does all that tacky red stuff for weddings anymore? That dress is the only decent thing, but I hate the lace on the back...""  
  
Thorne reached over and pinched her cheek, his eyes full of adoration.  
  
""Next auction, I'll take you baby. Whatever catches your eye, we'll bid on it.""  
  
""Yes! Excellent, Thorne!""  
  
Swallowing the pain in my chest, I took a deep breath. I couldn't watch their lovey-dovey bullshit anymore.  
  
""I don't want any of that stuff. Deal whatever you want with it.""  
  
This was the first time I'd ever spoken to Thorne with any real backbone. The person on screen just stared for a full thirty seconds.  
  
Cressida recovered first, tears streaming down her face. ""I... I said something wrong, didn't I? I'm sorry... Vesper, I was just trying to, you know, get closer to you.""  
  
I cut her off coldly.  
  
""Stop to bother trying to get closer to me! Now or ever—we're never going to have a relationship.""  
  
That made her cry even harder.  
  
Thorne pulled her into his arms protectively, one hand rubbing her back, the other gently wiping her tears.  
  
Through the screen, he shot me a disapproving look.  
  
""Cressida didn't say anything wrong, and she didn't do anything wrong either. You're the one in the wrong here, Vesper. You're being way too aggressive. What the hell's gotten into you today? You've completely changed—you never used to give people a hard time.""  
  
""What was that supposed to mean just now? Cressida's baby are going to call you mom, and instead of making an effort to get close to her, you're being cold and sarcastic when she tries to be nice. You're getting way too full of yourself!""  
  
I let out a bitter laugh.  
  
He knew I never gave people trouble, but he'd forgotten how many people gave me trouble.  
  
""Thorne, her kids don't need to call me mom. She doesn't need to get close to me. And our wedding... we don't need to have that either.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The comforting sounds on the other end suddenly stopped.  
  
Thorne's face went stone cold as he said ""Fine"" three times in a row.  
  
The call cut off abruptly, and the next second, a video popped up on my phone.  
  
My hands were shaking as I opened it. The pristine white wedding dress was being devoured by flames, bit by bit.  
  
Thorne's voice was ice cold.  
  
""Looks like you thought you were about to become Mrs. Ashwyck, so you forgot your fucking place. Vesper, you're just some orphan the Ashwyck family took in. What gives you the right to talk back like that? If my mother and the family elders hadn't conspired to drive Cressida away back then, you think you'd ever have a shot at being the future Mrs. Ashwyck?""  
  
""You only had to wait ten more months to officially become Mrs. Ashwyck, but you just had to push it.""  
  
""Consider this dress a lesson. When you finally get your attitude in check and truly accept Cressida, then we can talk about having that wedding.""  
  
I turned off the video and collapsed on the couch, staring blankly at the ceiling.  
  
The cold wind dried the tears on my face, and for a moment, I felt like I was back in that freezing underpass.  
  
Thorne was right. I was just an orphan Mrs.Henrietta had picked up.  
  
More specifically, I was fished out of the river by Henrietta.  
  
I was ten years old then. I'd run away from the children's home because the director was sexually abusing the girls, ended up living rough on the streets—couldn't eat enough food, couldn't go to school, getting beaten by everyone. So I decided to end it all.  
  
Mrs.Henrietta took me in after that, gave me food, kept me from starving to death on the streets.  
  
For the first few years, I was basically invisible. Anyone in the Ashwyck household could step all over me, except for Thorne—he was the only one who'd smile kindly at me.  
  
He'd sneak me out for pasta when I was being punished with no dinner, and when I had no money for school supplies, he'd share half his allowance and give me his spare stationery.  
  
On his fifteenth birthday, he ditched his tutoring session to take me to that pottery studio, spent his entire year's allowance made me a ceramic piece with his own hands—something that would never fade or lose its shape.  
  
""I hope our Vesper can wear a beautiful wedding dress like the one on this pottery when she marries me someday.""  
  
I still remember how my heart raced that day. ""I... I'd like that too.""  
  
My voice was so quiet, Thorne didn't seem to hear me.  
  
A few months later,Mrs.Henrietta flew into a rage, and Thorne was forced to drop out of school for a month, locked away in the basement for daily reflection.  
  
During that time, I went to find Thorne and learned it was because he'd brought Cressida home.  
  
He really liked Cressida. He said she was the only joy in his dreary days. He asked me, ""Did my mother say when she'd let me out? I miss Cressida so much. It's my fault—I was too hasty.""  
  
Hearing those words, I felt momentarily dizzy, a sharp pain in my chest.  
  
That flutter of hope in my heart died away. I knelt on the prayer cushion next to him, head down, suddenly unable to tell him that Mrs.Henrietta had already decided to groom me as his future legal wife.  
  
""He's only seventeen and nearly broke with Ashwyck Family over a girl. I need to teach him a lesson!""  
  
In Thorne's eyes, Henrietta was domineering and the family elders were old-fashioned. He'd always wanted to break free, to escape the Ashwyck family.  
  
And I was the perfect tool for that. The future heir and the heir's wife—they had to control at least one of us, so they could rest easy knowing that when Thorne eventually took full power, he wouldn't completely cut ties because of conflicting ideologies.  
  
Soon after, Cressida was sent away to school elsewhere by Henrietta, and Thorne was released.  
  
Six months later, he found out about the family's plans for me. That day he came to find me and slapped me hard across the face.  
  
From then on, he started hating me.  
  
I didn't sleep all night.  
  
The next day, a phone call woke me up. Just one sentence on the other end,""Come to the Ashwyck estate.""  
  
I knew Mrs.Henrietta had probably found out about Cressida's pregnancy.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I didn't waste any time—threw some things together and headed out to catch a cab to the Ashwyck estate.  
  
When I arrived, Henrietta had already thrown her tantrum.  
  
The moment she saw me, she hurled her coffeecup at me in fury. ""You're absolutely fucking useless! All these years and you can't even keep a man interested. What's the point of the Ashwyck family keeping a worthless piece of shit like you!""  
  
The rim grazed my temple, drawing blood.  
  
I instinctively bowed my head and apologized.  
  
Meanwhile, Thorne sat on the expensive sofa with Cressida in his arms.  
  
He wasn't the powerless kid he used to [be.Now](http://be.Now) he was the CEO, and everyone in the Ashwyck household had to listen to him.  
  
Even Henrietta and the family elders couldn't say much anymore.  
  
Finally, Henrietta got tired of yelling and plopped down on the sofa to continue her coffee.  
  
""So what's your plan now?""  
  
""We're having the baby.""  
  
Thorne's tone left no room for argument.  
  
Henrietta frowned and turned to look at Cressida.  
  
""And you?""  
  
Cressida bit her lip, tears streaming down her face. ""Thorne and I really love each other... I already lost one baby before.""  
  
A flash of guilt crossed Thorne's face. He pulled Cressida protectively behind him, looking at me with what seemed like actual hatred.  
  
""If it wasn't for her, our baby would already be calling you grandma.""  
  
I knelt on the cold floor, suddenly freezing all over.  
  
After my falling out with Thorne, life in the Ashwyck house became even more miserable. I tried to explain to him several times, but he just ignored me completely.  
  
Until he turned twenty, when Cressida came back.  
  
One night, Cressida called saying Thorne was in trouble and gave me their location.  
  
I rushed over in a panic, only to find clothes scattered all over the ground outside a garden.  
  
The next day, Thorne was punished again, kneeling in the basement. The difference this time was that Cressida was pregnant.  
  
Henrietta demanded she get an abortion.  
  
Thorne refused and threw a massive fit in the basement.  
  
On the day of Cressida's procedure, I secretly let Thorne out, but it was too late.  
  
Afterward, Cressida left heartbroken for Boston, and Thorne smashed my phone, leaving me with just one sentence,  
  
""You should be grateful you let me out, otherwise you'd be the one be punished today.""  
  
Despite saying that, strangely enough, Thorne started talking to me again after that.  
  
I numbly lifted my head. So Thorne had been blaming me all this time for showing up that night.  
  
But I had no idea someone had followed me there...  
  
""When I'm done playing around, I'll get married.""  
  
After that, he had an endless stream of girlfriends, sleeping around until Cressida came back and showed up at his bachelor party...  
  
""I wanted this baby—it has nothing to do with Cressida. Mom, please stop breaking us up, okay?""  
  
To completely protect Cressida and the baby, Thorne finally gave in. That one word, ""Mom,"" made Henrietta soften.  
  
""Those seven other girls who secretly... collected cum what you left behind and got themselves pregnant—I never saw you fight this hard for them. But when she gets pregnant, you... Ugh, forget it. Mrs.Martha!""  
  
The housekeeper, Martha, brought a bowl of medicine in front of me. It was black and had a sharp, pungent smell.  
  
""You need to make a choice. If you still want to be Mrs. Ashwyck, drink this medicine—you'll never be able to have children again. If you don't want to...""  
  
Before Henrietta could finish, Thorne made the decision for me.  
  
""Vesper, drink it.""  
  
My mind went blank for a second. I looked at him in disbelief.  
  
""Why?""  
  
Thorne's expression was cold. ""I told you—Cressida's children will call you mom, so you won't need to go through the pain of having kids yourself.""  
  
He paused, then added, ""This also prevents your future children from competing with Cressida's kids for Ashwyck Family's property. Aren't you always the most obedient and understanding? Just drink it.""  
  
Martha pushed the medicine closer to me, practically ready to pry my mouth open and pour it down my throat.  
  
Cressida looked down at me from her high perch, eyes gleaming with amusement.  
  
""Come on, Vesper, just drink it. This medicine will only make you infertile—no other side effects. Mrs.Henrietta and Thorne wouldn't hurt you, would they? Why are you being so resistant?""  
  
Henrietta impatiently urged me on. ""What are you waiting for? Drink it! I saved your life—you think I'd hurt you now?""  
  
My nails dug deep into my palms as I pressed my lips together and stubbornly turned my head away.

In most cases, these aren’t AI problems. They’re just logic problems. You can solve them with basic scripting or a simple web form. No LLMs, no embeddings, no agents required.  
Is it because AI feels cheap to build with now? Because it sounds good in a pitch? Or are people just chasing hype instead of solving real problems with the simplest tools?  
I’m not against AI at all, I use it myself, but it feels like we’re starting with the tech and then looking for a problem. It’s like using a bulldozer to hang a picture frame.  
Is this a sign of creative exploration, just a whole lot of overengineering, or both?

Sweet tea is usually prepared by brewing hot tea and then chilling it before serving over ice. But how much caffeine is in a cup of sweet tea? And should you be concerned?

# How Much Caffeine Is in Sweet Tea?



The **caffeine content** depends on the tea used and how strong it’s brewed. On average:

* [Homemade sweet tea (8 oz): 20–50 mg caffeine](https://dofotea.com/blogs/news/the-best-tea-for-sweet-tea-your-guide-to-perfectly-sweetened-brew)
* Fast food or bottled sweet tea: 30–70 mg per serving
* For comparison, a typical cup of coffee has about 95 mg of caffeine.

# What Type of Tea Is Used in Sweet Tea?

Most sweet tea is brewed with **black tea**, which is naturally caffeinated. If you're trying to cut down on caffeine, try using:

* **Decaf black tea**
* **Herbal options** like rooibos or hibiscus

These can help you enjoy sweet tea flavor without the stimulant.

# Should You Limit Caffeine in Sweet Tea?

If you’re sensitive to caffeine or drinking it in the evening, consider limiting your intake or switching to decaf. For most people, **moderate caffeine intake is safe**, but large amounts may affect sleep, anxiety, or heart rate.",1,1749629669.0,ChineseTeaCultureNetw,0,1.0,False
