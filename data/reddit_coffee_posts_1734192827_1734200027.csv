They said it was not within their remit and we would have to get decorators in to seal this. We offered coffees and they accidentally spilt this on our new wool carpets. They were apologetic and have paid for profesional cleaning. However, the stains are still there and not faded at all. Carpet is beige. Would it be reasonable to ask them to replace the whole carpet in the room or ask for compensation for this? Would assume they should have insurance for situations like these but on the other hand don't want to be an unreasonable customer. Just annoying that they came, we are still left with a very cold room and now stained carpets! The windows are still meant to be under warranty. ",0,1734199646.0,AskUK,1,0.5,False
1he8m31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1he8m31/the_stranger/,The Stranger,"  My wife and I recently moved to her hometown into her childhood home. It was bigger than our old house with plenty of room for not just our two cats, but a new kitten. He was a feisty little guy, easily the most courageous of his siblings. When we brought him home, it wasn’t long before he wanted to explore every nook and cranny of the place. If there was any space we thought it was too dangerous to let him into, he would throw a hissy fit at us, annoyed that there was an untouched area that he wasn’t allowed into. All this is to say, our little guy, Rorschach, was not easily cowed. It was a little surprising to us then, when he was staring, hair up and back arched, into what was to be my wife’s office one evening. The light was on, so I don’t think there was any way he could’ve mistaken anything in there for a threat. Our other cat, Tarrare, was also in the office, so we thought maybe he got spooked by her, seeing as how the little guy still hadn’t gotten completely used to the other cats. I checked the office anyway, for pests or the like, then to be thorough, I looked along the wall outside. Nothing amiss. We didn’t think anything of it at the time. After all, Tarrare was completely at ease in the office.

  A few days later, we put our other cat, Häagen-Dazs, alone in the bathroom with the hot water running. She had allergies and the steam from the shower seemed to ease her sinuses. After a short while, my wife, we’ll call her RocksAnn, went to the bathroom to check on her. When she went in, she saw Häagen-Dazs staring intently at the running water. She called her name, but she didn’t respond. Maybe the running water was too loud. She reached down to pet her, but when she did, Häagen-Dazs flipped out, literally. She sprung up and flipped against the wall like a jack in the box popping out. I don’t know what made the poor girl so spooked. We’d done this shower treatment for her at least a dozen times before, but I guess it was the first time in the new house. Again we didn’t think much of this as all that really happened was our cat got spooked by a room she wasn’t really used to. Cats are finicky like that. Häagen-Dazs was no different and unlike Rorschach was fairly timid and skittish. In fact I wouldn’t have bothered writing and posting anything about these two pretty mundane experiences had it not been for the next few weeks, and now I can’t help but feel there could be more to them.

   I should note how our house is situated. For the most part, it’s the usual setup of a neighbor’s house on either side and facing the street. The back though, rather than being framed by more neighbors, is lined with the town cemetery. It’s actually nice because most of our neighbors play loud obnoxious music. Not a peep from the cemetery though. Anyways, the first few weeks at the house went without incident besides those with the cats. Around the fourth week though, a few things seemed to be amiss. Little things mostly. Lights would flicker off, just for a moment, then something would be in a spot where I swear I didn’t leave it. One time I heard my wife call my name from another room, so I went to check on her.

  “What?”, she asked.

  “You called me.” I told her.

  “Nah, your headphones must be blurring other noises.”

  Maybe. I did always wear headphones while doing most household tasks. Still, I heard her call my name clear as crystal. Could’ve been she was messing with me. We did often scare each other. But that was always by cheap jump scares. Maybe she was making her scare game more convoluted but I didn’t think so. This was a woman whose humor was people falling over. She wasn’t exactly all about subtlety. Besides if she was messing with me, she would’ve made sure to laugh at me about it later, but she never did. That was one of the weirder happenings. Another thing was my figurines. I collect a lot of action figure type stuff, bionicles mostly. Yes I’m twenty six years old. Most of them are pretty poseable figures and can have their limbs and heads moved every which way. Well I had a few on the kitchen table that I hadn’t put on a shelf yet. When I woke up one morning and went into the kitchen to make coffee, I barely noticed that all their heads were looking at the window that faced the cemetery. I know none of them were posed like that the day before. I don’t think my wife did that to mess with me either. It’s such a small thing that I could’ve easily missed. I kinda wish we had some curtains for that window now. 

  Writing this now I also just realized when the weird goings on stopped, at least for a little while. Our house used to have central heating and a/c, but the system hasn’t been used for years, and we had no plans to start it back up again any time soon. So all the ceiling vents that had been open, we closed. It was such a small thing that I didn’t think about at the time. But that’s when all the weird happenings stopped for about a week. I pushed the past events to the back of my mind and assumed it was over. We’d more or less settled in and everything was finally smoothing out. I was content to jot the odd stuff up to the expected stress of moving into a new home. 

  My convenient illusion came to an inconvenient conclusion though, when my wife and I were woken up in the middle of the night by a terrified yelping. I got up and went to the kitchen where it was coming from. When I turned the light on I saw Häagen-Dazs screaming and yelping and pawing at the kitchen window. I put on my shoes and went outside and looked around with my phone light. I probably should’ve also carried a blunt object like a bat or something, but I never claimed to be smart now did I? Besides I assumed it would be something like another cat that set Häagen-Dazs off. Our neighborhood had plenty of outdoor cats after all, and a similar thing happened at our old house with Tarrare. Her and a stray cat had gotten into a tiff with the window keeping them from getting at each other. Anyway I couldn’t find anything outside to warrant concern. That is until I shined the light on the window. That’s when my blood froze. On either edge of the window was a dirty handprint, and in the middle was a badly drawn happy face, also from dirt. Two dots and a semi circle. The dirt had dripped down in spots. From the left eye it looked like a tear. I did not want to be outside a second longer. I went in and made sure all the doors were locked. When I told RocksAnn what happened we decided to call the police. We told them what happened and showed them the handprints. Unfortunately for whatever reason, there were no fingerprints to examine. Whoever it was must’ve been wearing gloves they said. They told us that since we weren’t in the best neighborhood, it’s possible that some kid was in our yard and trying to mess with us. There wasn’t much else they could do, so we were told to keep an eye open and call if anything else happened. We didn’t really sleep that night.

  The next couple of weeks were rough to say the least. I started finding those same dirty handprints on both of our vehicles. A couple times there was one on the living room window. We called the cops again twice, but there was still no way to trace the prints. I wanted to set up cameras but we couldn’t afford much in that department. One night I did tape my phone high on the wall facing the cemetery to record all night. Nothing. Things came to a head on a Saturday night. We were just about to fall asleep, when I heard something that froze my blood. A knock. At the back door. Well not quite a knock. More like a slap. I got up and put on my robe. Quietly as I could, I inched to the front door. RocksAnn waited for me in the living room. I put my ear close to the back door, waiting. In spite of me wearing a fairly thick robe, it felt so cold. I know we hadn’t insulated the back door but still, the cold air was thick and almost made it hard to breathe. Even though I was expecting it, I still almost jumped out of my skin when I heard the slap again. The hand, or what I assumed was the hand, slid against the door. Almost like a cat pawing, but slower and more rough. And also more…deliberate. The doorknob remained undisturbed. I motioned away from the door as silently as I could. My hand found a hammer that I still hadn’t found a place in the house for. The stranger pawed at the door once more. That’s about when I heard the stranger’s voice, only it wasn’t a stranger’s voice. It was my wife’s voice on the other side of the door.

  “H-Hel-lo?”, said the stranger. I was not about to answer back. The way their greeting was spoken sounded breathy. Almost like a whispered hiss. I could see RocksAnn from where I stood at the kitchen/back door. Through the darkness, I could see her face had gone ashen. I can’t imagine I looked any different. The stranger’s one word had shifted our perspective on the past few weeks. Whatever was on the other side of that door was no punk kid or vagrant. No telling if it was really a person at all. And while my wife and I said nothing to each other, the looks we exchanged affirmed that neither of us wanted to find out. After waiting for a few painfully long minutes, the stranger made a new noise. Not a slap on the door, but a knock. And then they spoke once more, now more clearly and fluently. “Hello?” It was my own voice this time. I had to cover my mouth to keep from gasping. It knocked one more time, in this case with a rhythm I used all the time: shave and a haircut. 

  Knock-knockknockknockknock. 

  Now I was starting to get pissed. It’s like it was mocking us, and not just because it was using our voices. Still, I was not about to open the door. Nor were either of us going to say a word to our would be intruder. All we could do was wait. It didn’t knock again. It didn’t repeat its greetings. All it did was breathe, loud enough to be heard by me anyway. It sounded tired. Almost like an old man whose lungs weren’t what they used to be. I hoped it couldn’t hear us breathe. For the better part of an hour I stood by the door shivering. I should’ve been sweating in my thick robe. Eventually the breathing faded, and the deep chill subsided. And the room felt normal again. For a minute I thought it was over, and maybe it was. But I never claimed to be smart now did I? 

  For whatever reason, curiosity, stupidity, whatever you like, I moved my hand to the doorknob. I saw my wife shake her head at me emphatically. I mouthed a probably unconvincing “It’ll be fine” at her, and I opened the door and went outside. I shined my phone light through the night and saw no sign of anything. It was a quiet, still night. Peaceful even. Or at least it would be if it weren’t for the past hour. I shined my light at the still open door. On the outside was the familiar dusty handprint, slid down the door. I put my hand next to it. It was a little smaller than mine. I decided it was probably time to get back inside and lock the door. That was about when I heard a gust of wind getting louder by the second. I swore under my breath and scrambled inside and just as I was slamming the door, I felt a burst of blistering cold, dusty wind. I looked at RocksAnn. She had both hands in her hair and the most horrified look I had ever seen on her face. I tried to think, to delude myself, that maybe it was just ordinary wind, or that I’d closed the door in time. But I knew better. I’d let my curiosity get the best of me. And I’d foolishly let a stranger into our house.",1,1734199609.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1he8gyg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1he8gyg,Abgerny's Mini-Comic: Misunderstanding,"Now that the creators have revealed the relationship between the characters in Abgerny, I can't help but theorize about the relationship between Vurr and Juan.

Before the apocalypse, Vurr and Juan were quite close because Vurr was an easy going person who often volunteer to help her friends when they're in trouble, while Juan would be the one to guide everyone with his intelligence and protect everyone from danger. The two often enjoy being together and work very well when they are together. Vurr often mentions Juan to Ethan when she has to take care of him when Ethan's parents hire her. Juan's story makes Ethan admire Juan a lot and sometimes asks Vurr to take him to meet Juan. Vurr may or may not accept the request because it can be divided into two situations: 
1. Accepting ""but"" the apocalypse happened first and Vurr disappeared during that time, so Ethan really got to know Juan when Juan found him in his hiding place. 
2. Rejecting because Juan is busy or Juan's place is far from Ethan's house, making it difficult to travel to visit.

Because Vurr and Juan are very close and like to be together in front of others often, it makes many people misunderstand that they are a ""couple"". Of course, both Vurr and Juan deny this claim all the time and always explain to everyone that they are just ""friends"". But few people believe it and often tease them whenever they are together. Which made them feel a little annoyed, but their friendship is still strong. 

Now, during the apocalypse, let's say Juan's group was able to save Vurr from the clutches of the mysterious organization that kidnapped her. I think their relationship will still be the same, except that Vurr will start to care more about Juan and will always be by his side because Juan's left eye is gone. Juan will continue to lead everyone and protect the group, while Vurr will be lookout for Juan, especially his left side, which is Juan's blind spot. When this happens, the teasing cycle returns again within the group, and Ethan, when he hears it a lot, can't help but be curious and ask them directly (as you can see in the short comic I drew). Of course, Vurr and Juan refused again, but Kori, being himself, often likes to crack jokes about their closeness, while Molly doesn't think much of the teasing about their relationship. Just to support them when they have problems with each other.

PS. Ethan's curious pose is based on one of Kokichi Oma's sprites from Danganronpa V3, while Vurr and Juan's poses are based on Ryuuji Takasu in the coffee drinking scene (which I can't remember which episode it's from because the anime is so old and I'm too lazy to find it). As for Vurr and Juan's hairstyles from the side view... ""I drew them myself"" and it took me more than ""4 hours"" to draw this part because I tried to find the angle of the characters' hairstyles to make them look good and not too ""ugly"". In the end, the result was better than I thought in my eyes. Oh, and I allow everyone to draw my comic in any form. It can be an animal avatar version of the characters in abgerny or not related to abgerny at all. I don't mind, just don't forget to include the source of the comic. That's enough for me ^ _ ^",1,1734199234.0,abgerny,0,1.0,False

# Have you ever wondered if coding could be as engaging and addictive as playing video games or endlessly scrolling through Instagram? What if there’s a way to rewire your brain to crave coding just as much as it craves gaming or social media?

For some context, my journey into coding and web development has been unconventional. I’ve learned five programming languages, developed expertise in cybersecurity, and carved out a niche in WordPress theme development. Over the years, I’ve redesigned more than 45 themes as part of my portfolio and completed the development of over 100 custom WordPress themes, creating tailored solutions for various clients and projects.

But it wasn’t always this way.

In the beginning, I was deeply addicted to video games, spending countless hours playing ***Clash of Clans, FIFA*** and ***PUBG***. Like many, I also fell into the habit of endlessly scrolling through social media feeds, losing track of time. Coding, at that stage, felt more like a tedious task than something enjoyable or rewarding.

However, as I began exploring the world of theme development and cybersecurity, I became increasingly drawn to the creative and problem-solving aspects of coding. This transformation didn’t happen overnight, but through consistent effort and applying certain strategies, I turned my interest in gaming into a passion for building, securing, and creating. The journey has been challenging yet incredibly rewarding.

So, how did I make the leap from being a video game junkie to someone who is genuinely addicted to coding?

In this article, I’ll explain five psychological strategies I used to rewire my brain and develop a passion for coding. These tips helped me build a lasting habit and might help you do the same.

# Why Are Some Activities Addictive While Others Aren’t?

Before diving into the *how* let’s first address the *why*. Why do activities like video games and social media feel so addictive, while coding or studying can feel like an uphill battle?

The answer lies in a molecule in our brain called **dopamine**. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with reward and pleasure. It’s released whenever we experience something enjoyable, like winning a game, receiving likes on a post, or unlocking an achievement.

Video games and social media are specifically designed to exploit this system by offering frequent, immediate rewards, keeping us hooked for hours. Conversely, coding often involves delayed gratification—results come only after sustained effort, making it harder to stay motivated initially.

But here’s the good news: you can hack this system. Understanding how dopamine works and applying specific techniques can turn coding into an enriching and enjoyable activity.

# The 5 Psychological Hacks That Made Coding Addictive for Me

1. **Gamify the Process:** Coding can be more engaging by introducing game-like elements, like video games. For instance, I set small, achievable goals for each coding session and rewarded myself when I completed them. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank are great for this, as they provide badges, leaderboards, and progress tracking that mimic gaming achievements.
2. **Focus on Immediate Feedback:** One reason games are so addictive is that they provide instant feedback—you know immediately whether you’ve won or lost. I started applying this principle to coding by working on interactive projects, such as building small web apps or games, where I could quickly see the results of my efforts.
3. **Pair Coding with Existing Enjoyable Habits:** I began combining coding with things I loved, such as listening to music or sipping my favorite coffee. Associating coding with these enjoyable activities helped me look forward to my sessions.
4. **Create a Streak:** Like keeping a streak on social media or gaming apps, I started tracking the number of consecutive days I could code. Over time, the desire to maintain the streak became a motivator.
5. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Instead of waiting for significant milestones, I learned to celebrate every small achievement, such as debugging a tricky error or finishing a new feature. Recognizing these victories kept me motivated and reinforced the habit.

# How You Can Apply These Hacks

By incorporating these strategies, I turned coding into an activity that felt as rewarding as gaming or scrolling through Instagram. The key is to structure your environment and routine to align with your brain’s natural reward system.

So, if you’ve ever struggled to stay motivated with coding, try these hacks. With consistent effort, you might look forward to your next coding session as much as your favorite game or social media feed.

„I would not wish any companion in the world but you”

Dating me is like walking over the moon and reading Shakespeare.

I’m Jack, 31, i live on Midwest, but definitely want to move somewhere in the near future. Got Montana on my list, maybe Texas, somewhere west, but i’m open for suggestions. I love nature and quiet places. A big house, maybe a farm, or a ranch, big happy family and watching stars on the porch every night with my wife.
Even though reddit is definitely not the best place to find anyone mature and living close to you, i’m trying anyway cause you never know. Posting here from time to time and i hope that maybe my soulmate is gonna read it one day.

My grandparents met on a train. What if my grandfather missed a train that day or took a different one?
I don’t want to miss my train with You.


WHAT IS MY GOAL?

My goal is to find a fine woman, my soulmate to build a future with. I’m ready to settle down in the next few years, i want to have family and kids in the future and i know how to treat them well. I will kiss you good-morning and goodbye, open and hold the doors for you, listen to your needs and thoughts and be there for you whenever you need it. And what’s more important - i will always respect you and try to understand. I’m a gentleman and i was raised like that, i have a way with women and i can talk with anyone, just give me a chance. I can make you fall in love with me in 72 hours*

First of all i think three important factors you looking for are: 1. Mutual attraction 2. Similar goals/shared interests 3. He is not a complete dumbass

I will start with mutual attraction. I’m willing to exchange pics in private just so we know that this can work and you like my appearance. I don’t want to add my pic to this post cause i care about my privacy. I will be honest by saying it is an important objective, a physical attraction. We can share pics right away to not waste each other’s time.

To make things easier i can say a few things about my looks: 5”11 (180 cm), 165 lbs (75 kg), blue eyes, black hair, broad shoulders, deep voice, nice smile, good heart.

Second most important thing for you is who i am and what i like.

I’m a man of strong moral fiber. I value honesty, loyalty and kindness. I treat people right and i’m willing to help whenever i have a chance, i also care for my family which is super important to me. I see myself as a conservative person. I hold traditional values and i got much respect for religion and history. Individual freedom and free speech is all i’m about, also i’m a pacifist, i will defend my family and close ones with all i have, but at the same time i’m not looking for troubles and not getting into fights, that was never my thing, i like to resolve problems with words, not fists.

Shared interest paragraph is ready to go. I like to read a lot, i also write some stuff, im getting ready to publish my book one day (all i need is more inspiration from You, pleas be my Muse).

Music is my thing, i’m going to a lot of concerts and festivals, road trips, playing eight ball and soccer, watching youtube channels about history, science, cosmos and some other topics, i’m watching a lot of tv series and movies, like to spend time outside by walking or hiking, i like outdoors but i’m also a huge fan of spending time in bed and doing nothing.

Favorite music: too many to write them all down but grunge like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, some britpop or rock like Oasis and Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, Kings Of Leon, rap Drake, Kid Cudi, J Cole, some rnb like Majid Jordan, Jorja Smith, The Weeknd + dance or electro music like Tourist, Kaytranada and just much, much more :)

My favorite writers to name a few are Kerouac, Murakami, Vonnegut, Shakespeare, Bukowski, Fitzgerald, Sallinger.

Favorite director is definitely David Fincher, although i like Tarantino and Linklater and many more.

I love everything about 90s - music, movies, television, soccer, games, fashion, JUST VIBES in general. It was such a good time, good days. I like to rewatch movies from 90s from time to time, some funny comedies but also some romantic movies or both, recently i did it with Notting Hill, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, both are awesome! I can watch anything with Brad Pitt.

WHAT IS MY GOAL PART 2/WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR

As for the kids - i even have some names for kids that we can discuss it. I know how hard it is growing up without a father figure that’s why i always wanted to give that to my children, a big and happy home where dad and mom loves each other a lot and sending this vibe to their children. I also want to show to my kids all the books and music albums we love so much and i want to be for them always to raise them well! So if you are up for that - awesome!

I want a woman who is ambitious, i want her to support me cause i will do the very same thing. I want you to watch a soccer game with me willingly and i want you to invite me to your world, show me what you love and i want to be in it for you, even if it means watching a silly show in tv. Whatever makes you feel good, i want to be a part of it. Support, support, support and don’t kill the other person’s vibe, i’m up for it.

I want a woman that is willing to talk about our feelings and everything, cause a real talk is the most important thing to build a strong foundation. Let’s talk and don’t hide our feelings.

Life is worth living and it is way better to spend it all with the person you love, i want to find that person here. Maybe that is You? Let’s find out.

Also, the last thing - i’m not a complete dumbass, sometimes i’m just a silly boy!

FIND ME A GIRL AND I WILL MAKE HER HAPPY.

Also i want to include one of my fav quotes:

'Cause when you talk about these things, something ignites in you, and I can see it on your face.
And I don't see that on a lot of people. And, you know, whatever that feeling is, when you feel it, I feel that too.

And it's not just here. It's... It's afterwards. What I'm trying to say is i really like the way that I feel when I make you feel the way that you do.”

Let’s burn like stars, together, xx

I'm a 33yo historian from the United States who visits Paris and other areas of France 1-2x a year, typically for extended periods. I always enjoy my time in the city but would love to make some more local connections and meet new people. I'll be in Paris from 17-27 December and 10-17 January.

I enjoy visiting bookstores and many outdoor activities (biking, kayaking, swimming, etc.) I don't drink but don't mind a mellow pub or similar spot. Not so much into clubs. I do read and speak French, but my conversation is a little out of practice. 

I'd love to meet up with some new folks and grab food or coffee while I'm over there! Feel free to send a message.

AITA for taking her down?","About a year ago I was off duty and grabbing coffee and doughnuts from a popular coffee shop. It wasn’t too busy that day. There was a handful of people in front of me. They all seemed normal, except for this one woman who just had an air of Karenness about her. You all know the type. “I want to talk to your manager!” type. She gave some crazy sounding order and said her name was Karen. No joke lol.

The guy in front of me, another weirdo went to order and asked for a STRONG and BLACK coffee. He didn’t seem to understand what drip coffee is but he was happy with his order. I think. The Karen saw him get his coffee before her and started kicking up a fuss. She wasn’t really all that angry now that I think about it. She was calm and collected, just asking why his order was finished before hers.

In any case, I took my coat off to reveal my police uniform and I took her down. The whole nine yards. I tackled her to the ground and broke her nose before handcuffing her hands behind her back. I dragged her out to the car to bring her down to the station after kicking her in the ribs. Everyone thanked me. I felt like a hero in the moment as I threw her into the backseats and pepper sprayed her. For good measure I gave her a strike to the jaw.

We’re in the same classes, work on group projects together, and even commute to and from uni most of the time. We’ve been friends for three years, and we’ve always gotten along well without any major issues or arguments.

Last Thursday, she came to pick me up at 6 AM so we could go to the printing press together. Finals week means the printing places are always packed, so we wanted to get there early and finish everything before our 9 AM deadline. Initially, we planned to go to a nearby press, but when we called, they said the specific printer we needed wasn’t working. That left us with no choice but to go to a further press, which is always extremely busy, even though it’s open 24/7.

I called ahead and asked if they could start printing my work before I arrived. They agreed but said I’d need to send payment upfront through a cash transfer app. I sent them 1,000 pounds (printing is ridiculously expensive for our major, and my monthly allowance is around 6,000 pounds, so it’s a significant amount). Since my friend was still on her way, I called to let her know about the situation and suggested she do the same to avoid waiting hours in line. She said she didn’t have the app but would call them to ask if she could pay in person instead.

Later, she called me back and asked if I could send 500 pounds on her behalf so they could start printing her work. She promised to pay me back. I hesitated but agreed because I didn’t think she’d have any reason not to pay me. She complains all the time about how expensive printing is, so I assumed it was a no-brainer.

When we got to the printing press, we picked up our work, and she paid the remaining 400 pounds with her card. Then, on our way to uni, we stopped at a drive-thru for coffee. She offered to pay, saying it was her treat. I thanked her since I often cover her coffee or food when I’m driving, and in our culture, it’s polite to pay for the other person as a “guest.” The total for two drinks and sandwiches was about 300 pounds. However, her dad later called to ask why coffee cost so much (it was his card), and I overheard her say, “I paid for (my name)’s coffee since she paid for my printing.”

I was frustrated. First, I regularly pay for her coffee or food, so it’s not like I owe her for that. Second, how is 150 pounds worth of coffee equal to the 500 pounds I spent on her printing? Third, printing is a massive expense in our major—I spent 5,000 pounds on printing just that week—so the 500 pounds I lent her really makes a difference to me.

I thought maybe she forgot and would pay me back later, but today we met again with a group for a project, and she didn’t mention it. One of our friends even started complaining about someone else not paying her back for shared supplies, but my friend still didn’t acknowledge that she owes me.

I’m genuinely frustrated. We all still live on allowances, and our major is already financially draining with printing and supplies. It feels unfair for her to assume I can afford to cover both of our printing costs. She’s usually a good friend, and we’ve never had money issues like this before, so I don’t know how to handle it.

I recently took a Hoover Dam tour from Las Vegas and wanted to share my experience since I know many of you are probably planning trips to Vegas and wondering if it's worth visiting this engineering marvel.

I've been to Vegas multiple times but somehow never made it to Hoover Dam until last week. Let me tell you - I seriously regret not doing this sooner! The dam is absolutely mind-blowing, and the tour I took made the experience even better.

After researching different options, I went with this tour: https://athometouch.com/HooverDam and it was honestly perfect. They picked me up right from my hotel on the Strip in a comfortable bus (with a bathroom - crucial for that early morning coffee). Our guide Mike was hilarious and knew literally everything about the dam's history.

The tour started with a quick photo stop at the iconic Las Vegas sign - great way to kick things off! Then we headed to Boulder City, this charming little town built for the dam workers in the 1930s. The local museum there gives you amazing context about what it took to build this massive structure.

But the real highlight? Going inside the actual dam! We went 524 feet down into the powerplant - it's wild seeing those massive turbines up close. The engineering is just incredible. Walking on top of the dam was surreal too - you really grasp how massive it is when you're standing up there. The views from Memorial Bridge are spectacular - perfect for photos!

What I really appreciated was that lunch was included (and it was actually good, not some sad sandwich). Plus, they threw in a free comedy club ticket at The Strat, which was a nice bonus for the evening.

The whole thing took about 5.5 hours, which felt just right - not rushed but not dragging either. At $59, it's seriously good value considering everything that's included. They handle all the logistics so you can just enjoy the experience.

Quick tip: Book in advance if you can. Our bus was full and I heard they sell out pretty often, especially during peak season.

I know there are tons of tour options in Vegas, but this one's definitely worth your time and money. The dam itself is fascinating, and having a knowledgeable guide makes such a difference in understanding its significance.

Let me know if you have any questions! Happy to share more details about my experience.

Her ""recipe"" provides ingredients, but almost no instructions. Family members remember the cake as ""very good"" with thinly sliced pieces looking like stained glass windows. For context, she would have been baking this recipe around 50 years ago in Illinois.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup syrup (I am assuming corn syrup, but would a different type of syrup been available?)
* 1 cup coffee
* 1 box raisins (the boxes in my local grocery store are 12 oz, but my mom thinks the boxes used to be smaller. Any suggestions on quantity?)
* 1 box currents (again, I don't know how big of a box to use)
* 1 pound mixed fruit (I am not sure if this should be dried fruit or candied fruit; I am assuming it's not fresh fruit. I am planning on using dried apples, pears, tart cherries and prunes)
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon soda in hot coffee
* 4 cups flour (no idea if this is a standard US cup, or some random cup she had in the kitchen)
* pinch of salt
* 1 pound dates
* 1/2 pound walnuts, chopped
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp allspice
* 1 teaspoon cloves
* Little nutmeg
* 5 whole eggs

**Original Instructions:**

Bake two hours.

**Original Notes:**

This is a very large cake. Lemon, molasses, red cherries, brandy if desired.

**My guess at detailed instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the center position. Line 8x4 pans with parchment paper. (I don't know how many are needed, but I want smaller cakes, not one large cake.)
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, spices and salt.
3. Cream the butter and sugar together. Beat in syrup. Beat in eggs. Slowly add flour mixture, alternating with the soda in hot coffee.
4. Stir in dried fruit and nuts using a rubber spatula.
5. Transfer batter to pans. Smooth out batter.
6. Bake until done (I plan on checking before the 2 hours is up)
7. Cool completely and remove from pans.
8. Slice thinly with serrated knife.

**Questions:**

Please let me know if you have experience with similar fruit cakes. Do my guess at the instructions seems reasonable? Would you use dried fruit or candied fruit? What kinds of fruit would you use? The notes say brandy ""if desired."" Would you add the brandy to the cake, or pour it on the cake after it bakes?

1he7zdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KristoriaHere/comments/1he7zdn/decline_and_fall_of_the_roman_empire_the_age_of/,Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire: The Age of the Antonines (98–180 AD),"https://preview.redd.it/y0dcslmbou6e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab8141b2b8eb60d3494cfd9b5278152c4f4a7ee3

The Roman Empire during the Age of the Antonines (98–180 A.D.) represented a pinnacle of military strength, administrative sophistication, and territorial unity. The era was marked by a prosperous and stable administration under emperors like Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. This period is characterized by disciplined military strategies, the consolidation of territorial boundaries, and policies aimed at maintaining internal and external peace.

By the 2nd century, the empire encompassed vast and varied territories across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its boundaries were defined by natural landmarks, including:

* **West**: The Atlantic Ocean.
* **North**: The Rhine and Danube rivers.
* **East**: The Euphrates River.
* **South**: The deserts of Arabia and Africa.

This expansive reach included provinces such as Britain, Gaul, Spain, Dacia, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, among others. The empire was geographically diverse, spanning fertile plains, rugged mountains, and strategic waterways.

The period began with Emperor Nerva, who ruled from 96 AD to 98 AD. Nerva's reign was brief but significant, as he restored stability to the Roman Empire after the tumultuous rule of Domitian. One of Nerva’s primary goals was to repair the strained relationship between the emperor and the Senate. He overturned many of Domitian’s oppressive policies, released political prisoners, and returned confiscated property to its rightful owners. This approach earned him respect from the senatorial class. Nerva implemented policies to alleviate financial strain on the empire. He introduced measures to help the poor, such as the “alimenta” program, which provided financial aid to children and small farmers. He also reduced taxation and improved the administration of public finances.

He was succeeded by Trajan, who ruled from 98 AD to 117 AD. Trajan is remembered for his vast military conquests and extensive public building projects, including the construction of Trajan's Forum and Trajan's Column in Rome. Trajan invested heavily in infrastructure, building roads, bridges, and aqueducts to enhance connectivity and resource distribution across the empire. The famous Alcántara Bridge in Spain is a testament to his engineering initiatives. Trajan expanded the *alimenta* program, providing financial aid to poor children and improving food security for the population.

Trajan’s most celebrated military campaigns were against Dacia (modern Romania), a wealthy kingdom threatening Rome’s Danube frontier. The First Dacian War (101-102 AD) ended with a peace treaty, but continued hostilities led to the Second Dacian War (105-106 AD). Trajan’s forces decisively defeated the Dacians, annexing their kingdom as a Roman province. The conquest brought immense wealth to Rome, as Dacia’s gold and silver mines were exploited to fund public works and celebrations. In 113 AD, Trajan launched a campaign against the Parthian Empire, Rome’s long-standing rival in the East. By 116 AD, he had captured the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, and annexed territories in Mesopotamia, including Armenia and Assyria. However, unrest and logistical challenges forced his successor, Hadrian, to relinquish many of these gains.

Hadrian, who ruled from 117 AD to 138 AD, continued Trajan's policies but focused more on consolidating and fortifying the empire's borders. He is best known for building Hadrian's Wall in Britain and his extensive travels throughout the empire. Hadrian's Wall, which stretches across Northern England, was a monumental project aimed at keeping out the Picts and other tribes. Hadrian was also a well-traveled emperor, visiting nearly every province of the empire. His travels were not just for show; he inspected the troops, managed administrative tasks, and initiated numerous building projects.

The Antonine Dynasty began with Antoninus Pius, who ruled from 138 AD to 161 AD. His reign was characterized by internal peace and prosperity, as he maintained a stable government and promoted legal reforms. was a capable administrator who left a significant surplus in the imperial treasury. He also expanded access to drinking water throughout the empire and facilitated the enfranchisement of freed slaves. His reign is considered one of the most peaceful and stable periods in Roman history, earning him a place among the ""Five Good Emperors."" Antoninus Pius was succeeded by his adopted son, Marcus Aurelius, who ruled from 161 AD to 180 AD.

Marcus Aurelius is often remembered for his philosophical writings and his efforts to protect the empire from external threats, particularly during the Marcomannic Wars. The Marcomannic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between the Roman Empire and various Germanic and Sarmatian tribes from 166 AD to 180 AD. These wars primarily involved the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Iazyges, along with several other tribes. The wars took place along the northeastern European border of the Roman Empire, along the Danube River. The Marcomannic Wars were significant not only for Rome’s military engagements but also for their cultural and political ramifications. The conflicts tested the resilience and military strategy of the Roman Empire and led to changes in both the Roman military organization and frontier policy. One of the most notable aspects of the Marcomannic Wars was the Antonine Plague, which broke out during this period and severely weakened the Roman military and population. Despite these challenges, Marcus Aurelius managed to achieve several victories against the tribes, although the wars were prolonged and costly.

**All in all,**

The Roman military was the backbone of the empire's stability and expansion. Its disciplined and professional army combined strength with strategic prowess. Key features included:

* **Legions**: Each legion, comprising approximately 6,100 heavily armed infantry, was supported by auxiliary forces and cavalry. Their weapons and tactics, such as the *pilum* (javelin) and short swords, made them formidable on the battlefield.
* **Auxiliaries**: Drawn from non-citizen provincials and even barbarian tribes, auxiliaries provided specialized skills and flexibility in combat.
* **Engineering**: The Roman army excelled in constructing fortified camps, roads, and defensive walls like Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall in Britain.
* **Discipline and Training**: Soldiers underwent rigorous physical and tactical training, ensuring their readiness in peace and war.

The Roman administration skillfully managed the vast and diverse empire:

* **Local Governance**: Provinces were governed by Roman officials who enforced laws and collected taxes, ensuring a balance between central authority and local autonomy.
* **Economic Prosperity**: The provinces flourished under Roman rule, benefiting from improved infrastructure, trade networks, and agricultural productivity.
* **Cultural Integration**: The empire fostered a sense of unity through Roman law, language, and citizenship, while allowing local customs to persist.

The Roman approach to religion fostered tolerance and unity:

* **Polytheistic Integration**: Romans absorbed diverse religious practices, allowing a multitude of gods and local customs to coexist.
* **Philosophical Skepticism**: Intellectuals often viewed popular religious practices as mythological or useful civic tools rather than divine truths.
* **Practical Governance**: Religious practices were respected and even leveraged to maintain social harmony and discourage rebellion. The only exception to this tolerance occurred when rituals, like human sacrifices among the Druids, were deemed dangerous to society.

Rome's population policies fostered growth:

* **Citizen Expansion**: By incorporating non-Romans into citizenship and encouraging colonization, Rome multiplied its citizenry from tens of thousands to millions.
* **Provincial Integration**: Provinces became indistinguishable from the core Italian heartland in rights and responsibilities, symbolizing the empire's inclusivity.
* **Social Mobility**: Freedmen and their descendants gained opportunities, though limits on immediate advancement preserved hierarchical distinctions.

Rome’s public infrastructure reflected its unity and prosperity:

* **Monuments**: Public buildings like the Coliseum and aqueducts symbolized civic pride and functional genius.
* **Local Patronage**: Wealthy citizens funded projects, blending individual prestige with public benefit.
* **Urbanization**: Cities flourished, with notable urban centers in Gaul, Spain, Asia Minor, and Africa matching or surpassing their modern counterparts.

The Roman economy thrived through agriculture, trade, and luxury goods:

* **Agriculture**: Innovations like artificial grasses and expanded olive cultivation boosted food security and rural prosperity.
* **Trade Networks**: An extensive network of roads and ports facilitated commerce across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Exotic goods like silk and spices from India and Arabia underscored Rome's global connections.
* **Luxury vs. Practicality**: While criticized for promoting inequality, luxury consumption sustained trade and artisanal industries, redistributing wealth across the empire.

Despite widespread education, the era lacked innovation:

* **Philosophical Stagnation**: Classical schools dominated thought, discouraging creative inquiry.
* **Literary Diminishment**: While technical sciences like astronomy and medicine advanced, original literary and artistic achievements were sparse. Authors like Apuleius and Aulus Gellius produced works that have endured through the centuries, and there were still artists and artisans creating beautiful and intricate pieces.

Despite its strength, the empire faced challenges:

* **Barbarian Pressure**: Persistent threats from Germanic tribes and others tested Rome's military resources.
* **Internal Strains**: Economic disparity, corruption, and administrative inefficiencies began to surface.
* **Transition Post-Marcus Aurelius**: The death of Marcus Aurelius marked the end of this golden era, leading to gradual instability and eventual decline.

The Roman Empire during the Antonine era exemplified a complex and well-managed civilization at its peak. Its military discipline, administrative efficiency, and cultural influence left a lasting legacy that continued to shape subsequent civilizations.

[**PART I**](https://kristoria.substack.com/p/maoism-in-the-us-a-history) 

The RU faced internal political struggles, particularly over the assessment of Josef Stalin. The debate centered in the East Bay branch, with some members opposing the group's position on Stalin. This controversy threatened the organization's consolidation. Ultimately, the RU upheld Stalin, aligning with Maoist principles. Bob Avakian's speech at New York University in 1969 exemplified the RU's commitment to upholding Stalin. The RU's embrace of Stalin, despite its challenges, was a critical part of their political foundation. Steve Hamilton, reflecting on the struggle years later, highlighted the intensity of the internal debates and the impact on the organization's development.

The RU experienced its first split when some East Bay members, primarily ex-student movement intellectuals, opposed what they labeled as ""Stalinism."" This opposition was labeled rightist, and those members left the RU. Steve Hamilton later reflected that if the RU leaders had been more flexible in dealing with this criticism, the organization's history might have been different. Instead, the RU adopted positions from the Chinese and Russian revolutions uncritically, leading to long-term consequences.

Another internal struggle emerged soon after the publication of the initial Red Papers, led by Marv Treiger. Treiger's faction criticized the RU's positions on the United Front, women's liberation, and Black liberation in the US. The controversy included differences on how to address the actions of the Weathermen. Treiger's political journey was marked by turmoil and divisive debate, moving from the Communist Party to Maoism, then to Trotskyism, and eventually leaving the Spartacist League amid controversy. There were hints of FBI manipulation in the background, with documents from the period suggesting another player in the struggle. These documents, found in the archives of former RU member David Sullivan, included a political cartoon and a manuscript by-lined ""Marv Treiger,"" though the actual author is unclear. This manipulation added another layer of complexity to the internal struggles within the RU.

The Revolutionary Union (RU) was transitioning from a local Bay Area entity to a national organization in the spring of 1970. Bob Avakian, Leibel Bergman, Jane Franklin, and Barry Greenberg embarked on a national organizing tour to connect with revolutionary forces across the country. This tour was both successful and heavily surveilled by the FBI. Before the tour, an informant on the Executive Committee kept the FBI informed about the RU's efforts to establish organizational ties. During the tour, FBI surveillance was evident, with journalist Ron Koziol reporting on the RU's activities and movements. The FBI actively tried to limit the RU's gains by conducting interviews with people who had met with RU representatives, aiming to create distrust within the organization.

[Source: kites-journal.org](https://preview.redd.it/qo2rglvpnu6e1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=4676580020b047b6c7beca8bdb158d9769e67058)

Despite these efforts, the RU made significant progress, particularly in places like Yellow Springs, Ohio, home to Antioch College. In 1971, 21 Antioch students attended a meeting led by RU national representatives, leading to the establishment of RU chapters in Springfield, Dayton, and Cincinnati. The FBI's counter-intelligence efforts, while impactful, could not entirely thwart the RU's expansion and organizational growth.

The FBI considered creating a ""cover collective"" in Marin County to infiltrate the RU but ultimately decided against it, opting instead to target other leftist groups initially. Such sophisticated measures by the FBI went beyond typical surveillance, revealing an underestimation by the RU of the Bureau's efforts. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz suggested the RU's vulnerability was due to its members' tendency to exoticize the working class and people of color. Meanwhile, Bruce Franklin acknowledged suspicions about the Goffs but did not grasp the full extent of the FBI's infiltration.

The year 1970 was marked by increased anti-war demonstrations and violence, including bombings and property damage, as groups protested against the power structure. The RU was deeply entangled in these events, grappling with its stance on political violence.

[Bruce Franklin](https://preview.redd.it/xev9niornu6e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c85719273aaa50b4f9bf5b7a08fc3f86ab758101)

Bruce Franklin, a key figure in the RU, pushed for immediate revolutionary action, believing that urban guerrilla warfare was both necessary and feasible. He authored a position paper advocating for this approach, which suggested that the conditions in US cities were ripe for sustained guerrilla warfare. This paper, later known as **the ""A Paper,""** argued that the time for armed struggle was imminent, using examples of ongoing violence and the urban environment as justifications.

However, this stance led to significant internal conflict within the RU. Other members, like **Bob Avakian and Larry Harris**, countered with the ""B Paper,"" which rejected Franklin's call for immediate action. They argued that such actions would divert from building a strong base in the working class and could lead to the organization's early destruction. The debate highlighted a critical division within the RU on how and when to engage in revolutionary violence.

This period also saw the RU navigating its relationship with the Black Panther Party, which was itself divided between militant action and community-focused politics. The RU admired the Panthers but had to reconcile its support with its internal disagreements and the broader political climate. The internal struggle within the RU, known as the ""Franklin Struggle,"" exemplified the complexities and ideological battles of revolutionary movements during this tumultuous time.

The RU initially avoided recruiting Black members, encouraging them to join the Panthers instead. This approach eventually proved problematic as the BPP struggled to maintain its revolutionary stance, leaving the RU predominantly white.

During the Franklin controversy, criticism of a major Third World communist group like the BPP was unthinkable for Franklin's faction. They supported the Panthers as the vanguard of the American revolution. However, the internal struggle within the RU led to a shift in focus towards working-class organizing, de-emphasizing the struggles of national and ethnic minorities, which would pose future challenges.

The FBI closely monitored the RU's internal conflict and had informants within the organization. They had access to Franklin's **""Protracted Urban War"" paper** before it became public and used informants to report on RU meetings. The FBI's presence and manipulation, including plans to discredit the RU through external commentary, exacerbated the internal divisions. The RU members who opposed Franklin accused him of ""Weathermanism"" and acting recklessly with weapons. Personality conflicts, such as those highlighted in Avakian's memoir, also played a role in the split.

https://preview.redd.it/uu9b7botnu6e1.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=3252b06ea9d7004f267e792ee3a48f6086941bb7

**The declassified FBI memo dated November 27, 1973**, is an insightful piece of historical evidence detailing the FBI's intelligence-gathering activities during the 1970s, particularly regarding political movements and international relations. Marked as ""SECRET,"" the memo centers around a debriefing of individuals who had contact with Revolutionary Union (RU) leader Leibel Bergman and his wife Vicki on November 15, 1973.

The document provides specific information about Bergman's trip to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the Spring of 1973. Bergman commented on the political climate in China, noting a shift to the right and the noticeable absence of revolutionary quotes from Marx, Lenin, and Engels. This shift indicated changes in China's political landscape, which were of significant interest to the FBI at the time.

[Leibel Bergman and his wife Vicki](https://preview.redd.it/xe2nr0mvnu6e1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2e34d9edb4471aebbe419e388b12bdf01112d0f)

The conflict between Leibel Bergman and Bruce Franklin within the Revolutionary Union (RU) in the late 1960s was a significant event, closely monitored and manipulated by the FBI. The FBI viewed Bergman as the key leader and Franklin as a militant radical, and they sought to exploit tensions between them to weaken the RU. The FBI devised various schemes to create distrust between Bergman and Franklin, including fabricating letters and rumors suggesting that Bergman was a government agent.

One plan involved an alleged Chinese Communist agent contacting Franklin to express distrust of Bergman and imply future funding for the RU. Another scheme involved sending a letter to Franklin from an anonymous source, raising suspicions about Bergman's loyalty and suggesting he was working with the CIA. These efforts aimed to create a rift within the RU and slow down its operations.

[Venceremos Flag](https://preview.redd.it/36v3hrixnu6e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=edef064ac2815ab1f5f07deb159649f35846f6d7)

Despite these manipulations, the internal conflict within the RU eventually led to the expulsion of Franklin and his supporters. This split resulted in a significant loss of membership for the RU, with many members leaving to join Franklin in forming a new organization called **Venceremos**. This new group continued some of the RU's activities but faced its own challenges, including internal disorganization and the presence of informants.

The Goffs, despite being ridiculed as unsophisticated agents, provided an accurate assessment of the situation. Venceremos, the organization formed after the split from the Revolutionary Union (RU), began to disintegrate almost immediately. By the summer of 1971, half of the former RU members, primarily from Stanford, left to form the ""Intercommunal Survival Committee to Combat Fascism,"" a Black Panther Party (BPP) auxiliary. Venceremos denounced them as ""racist sissies,"" but remained a substantial organization with 225 members by February 1972.

Bruce Franklin continued his anti-war protests at Stanford, leading to his dismissal in 1972, marking the first firing of a tenured professor at Stanford since the McCarthy era. Venceremos continued community work, including running Venceremos College, a free school for Chicano students. The organization faced a major crisis in October 1972 when Venceremos members were involved in a violent prison break, resulting in the death of a guard. This led to arrests and convictions of several members, including life sentences for some. Authorities also arrested Franklin and others for harboring the fugitive, but charges against Franklin were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Venceremos attempted to tighten security, but their efforts were undermined by informants. By September 1973, the organization had dissolved. Franklin distanced himself from his revolutionary past, and his memoir omitted significant events like the Chino incident. Aaron Manganiello, a former leader of Venceremos, later cooperated with the FBI, reflecting the disintegration and internal conflicts within the organization. The FBI's attempts to recruit Manganiello as an informant were ultimately unsuccessful.

Vi este post de dicha persona en apuros (a causa de su propia mentira) y necesitaba consejos para que (lo mas probable/aparentemente) el primer día de su trabajo dicha mentira no quede expuesta y también los consejos que le daban para aquello (a pesar de que algunos hayan sido sin intención) y pues la verdad me dio la gana de burlarme y de reprochar tanto a el por lo que hizo (mentir de esa forma) y a aproximadamente 10 comentarios que vi los cuales varios le daban consejos (para encubrir su mentira) que simplemente no iba a funcionar y menos sin (aparentemente) el equipo necesario…al menos durante tan solo un fin de semana...solo iba a empeorar las cosas para quien mintió.

 

Luego recibí además de un bombardeo record de dislikes (el cual aun sigo viendo que la cantidad de karma en mi perfil disminuye) recibí toda clase de insultos y burlas…sin embargo noté que era por cosas totalmente distintas a lo que yo realmente estaba queriendo decir.

 

Me insultaron y se burlaron de mi porque pensaron que yo era una persona engreída/desagradable/narcisista/etc que se estaba burlando de quien posteó por el supuesto hecho de no tener experiencia ni conocimientos. El cual nunca fue así. Me decían unas cosas que la verdad me toco defenderme a todos y cada uno que me respondían.

 

Yo NUNCA me burlaría de alguien por el solo hecho de no tener conocimientos/experiencia, empezando porque yo mismo sigo siendo considerado como “novato” en el área. Y aún así tuviese mucha experiencia tampoco lo haría porque sé que nadie nace aprendido y todos siempre debemos empezar por aprender, y obviamente me incluyo. Sin embargo, después de mirar mis comentarios veo que pudieron haber dado la impresión de lo contrario lo cual pido mis sinceras disculpas a la comunidad. Créanme que yo mismo también hubiera lanzado toda clase de piedras a cualquier persona que es lo que pensaron que fui yo.

  
Y creanme que alguien que incluso teniendo menos experiencia que yo (o nada de experiencia) logre sobrepasarme con honestidad es algo que yo incluso valoro bastante. Yo no me enfadaría y mucho menos me resentiría, antes lo felicitaría bastante y me pondría a cuestionar mis habilidades de persuación y convencimiento.

 

Ahora, con respecto de haberme burlado por el hecho de mentir con el fin de destacarse ante los demás.

Sigo y seguiré firme de que mentir de esa forma es un acto deshonesto y reprochable, así sea de algo que se puede considerar como “insignificante”. Verán, el mercado laboral está de lo más saturado, especialmente en los trabajo “entry level”. Los jefes/reclutadores al ver tanta cantidad de gente aplicando ellos deben aceptar o descartar incluso por las cosas a las que uno podría pensar que son ""insignificantes"". En este caso el conocimiento para usar una maquina de espresso, esa pudo haber sido la razón de que esa persona haya sido aceptada y otra que tenga exactamente el mismo perfil pero que fue honesta en lo de no saber usarla haya sido descartada. Y eso no es justo, uno para destacarse en cualquier cosa nunca debe mentir de esa forma.

Y también pudieron haber personas incluso con conocimiento verdadero (así sea poco, así sea una persona) acerca de esas maquinas, personas que se esforzaron por ya sea hacer voluntariados, cursos para aprender para poder destacar su perfil de una manera honesta y luego ser descartadas por alguien quien no se tomó ni la molestia en aprender lo mas mínimo y mintió sobre aquello es mucho peor. Y si es tan fácil como muchos lo quisieron plantear, por que primero antes de aplicar no aprendió sobre aquello?

Cosas “insignificantes” que pueden traer consecuencias grandes.

Ahora, que lo pude haber dicho de una manera un poco más amable, si, es cierto. Lo cual pido disculpas también. Que de todas formas yo mismo le dije a la persona que posteó que quizás no sea el fin del mundo y que de hecho le den training desde 0. Que aprenda lo que tenga que aprender y Dios le ampare pero que no vuelva a mentir de esa forma. Al parecer nadie vio ese comentario.

 

Yo justamente ando buscando actualmente trabajo en exactamente lo que esa persona buscó, sin embargo yo me esfuerzo por aprender y practicar todas las habilidades requeridas en dicho  trabajo previamente para destacar mi perfil.

Me cuesta bastante encontrar trabajo por el hecho de que aun así me falta experiencia y de que pues no soy muy bueno dando “labia” en las entrevistas, a pesar de decir todo con honestidad.

 

Y ahora luego de ver ese post con esa confesión pues obviamente a mi me va a generar molestia, y me imagino que a cualquier otra persona se molestaría tambien si le pasase esto también.

 

No importa si no se requiere experiencia y dan training desde 0 y que eventualmente aprenda sobre eso, el hecho fue que se mintió de esa forma con el fin de destacar su perfil para posteriormente ser contratado. Que de todas formas si no se requiere conocimiento previo sobre eso, no habría ninguna razón para mentir. No importa si es un trabajo “no calificado” de salario mínimo, ese trabajo como cualquier otro sea “calificado” o no puede ser perfecto para iniciar la carrera de alguien. Todos los trabajos son valiosos de una forma u otra.

Tampoco importa que sea común o no mentir de esa forma o que las empresas hagan lo mismo, no le quita el hecho de ser un acto deshonesto y reprochable.

 

No me creo perfecto ni nada, nunca quise dar esa impresión. Lo único que quería decir es que yo si me esfuerzo realmente por destacar. A pesar de que yo soy consciente también de mis defectos.

 



Voy a compartir mi experiencia en el mercado laboral para que quizás sirva de inspiración de que ser honesto si es recompensado bien a pesar de que puede tomar mas tiempo.

 

Mi primer trabajo (dejando a un lado las practicas que fueron en mi misma universidad la cual a pesar de no ser pagas fue de lo mas llevadera y donde había muchísimo por aprender lo cual desafortunadamente no le di el mejor provecho), después de haber sido rechazado en todos los call centers a los que apliqué a pesar de haber pasado todas sus pruebas en inglés muy bien. Apliqué a un trabajo en una agencia de Marketing tipo User Generated Content, la cual se encarga de gestionar y editar todos los videos de los influencers promocionando cualquier producto. La oferta decía que se requiere 1 año por lo menos de experiencia pero pues aún así aplique sin tener nada de experiencia y obviamente diciendo que no la tenía, no tenía ni idea que era exactamente una agencia de esas.

Y respondieron a mi oferta y sorpresivamente me dijeron que mi perfil era llamativo a pesar de no tener experiencia en una empresa como esas. Y pues el día de la entrevista, después de leer todo lo que hace esa empresa lo cual si que me motivó bastante. Di todos mis motivos los cuales quería trabajar allí, estaba de lo mas motivado. Y pues me contrataron, a pesar de no haberme quedado allí por mucho tiempo me sentí tan agradecido de haber trabajado en una empresa como esas. Que nuevamente, pude haber rendido mejor.

 

Tiempo después tuve la oportunidad de trabajar en una tienda de teléfonos móviles muy reconocida, de limpieza. Y lo mismo, yo admití desde un inicio no tener experiencia.

Me aceptaron y yo al principio lo tomé como un trabajo mientras encontraba algo mejor pero pues fue tan bueno tanto el trabajo como mis compañeros y el ambiente en general que simplemente me enamoré de trabajar allí, aprendí muchísimo de como es trabajar en un sitio como ese.

 

También me dieron la oportunidad de trabajar en un Specialty Coffee como voluntario para tener mi primera experiencia en el área. Y lo mismo, jefes y compañeros geniales, y sobre todo los clientes. Literalmente todos los clientes que vi eran personas de lo mas amable. Me sirvió para posteriormente trabajar si en un trabajo pago en un café brunch donde a pesar de ser mas pesado que allí, lo mismo. Tanto mis jefes como mis compañeros (y los clientes) eran simplemente geniales y había también mucho por aprender.

 

Mucha gente dice que trabajar en esos sitios son de lo peor, de lo mas negrero que hay pero pues a mi a pesar de demorarme en encontrar un trabajo siempre quedo en un sitio que no es absolutamente nada a como mucha gente dice, siempre quedo en sitios geniales. Y creo que en parte es por siempre ser honesto en lo que hago y digo.

 

Entonces invitio a todos a que lo intenten, en vez de pensar formas de mentir y que dichas mentiras sean creíbles, por que no pensar formas legitimas de poder destacarse? Soy consciente que es mas fácil dicho que hecho y que probablemente no va a cambiar el mundo…

 

Y también es pensar como se sentiría uno si alguien a base de mentiras y engaños le quita algo que quería, así sea algo “insignificante”.

 

PD: Y no le veo nada de malo en decir una “mentira piadosa” en un CV como decir vendió mas de lo que realmente vendió, o de tener más tiempo de experiencia de lo que se tiene. Si puede rendir como la empresa busca o mejor desde el primer día inclusive demostrando que si tiene dicha experiencia a pesar de que los números sean menores no está nada mal y que de hecho no lo consideraría como una mentira sino como un valor agregado que es poder aprender muy rápido.

 

Y ya le pedí disculpas a la persona quien posteo por mensaje privado.

1he7upx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KristoriaHere/comments/1he7upx/part_i_maoism_in_the_us_a_history/,Part I. Maoism in The US: A History ,"https://preview.redd.it/y876v3r6nu6e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b58b0b17950284bc08b7dd54d27e7be7c98edc2

The historical significance of Maoism in the United States during the late 1960s and 1970s is often under-recognized, despite its impact as a revolutionary current. Maoism is frequently omitted or trivialized in U.S. historiography, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that minimizes its historical and potential contemporary influence. While Maoism has declined as a credible political philosophy, especially in China where Mao's legacy is disconnected from revolutionary principles, its core tenets still inspire global adherents.

The FBI's covert operations, particularly its infiltration of Maoist groups like the Revolutionary Union (RU) and later the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), are revealed through declassified documents. These documents shed light on figures such as Donald H. Wright, a key informant, and the broader operation of the Ad Hoc Committee (AHC), an FBI-created entity used to disrupt leftist movements. These operations capitalized on the tendency of small extremist groups to appear larger than they were, allowing the FBI to sow discord and confusion within the radical left. The AHC, for instance, consisted solely of informants and had no independent organizational structure, yet it successfully interacted with and influenced actual political organizations.

The investigation into the RU/RCP was the largest ever directed at any group within the new communist movement, highlighting the notable scale of the FBI’s surveillance. Unlike groups like the Weathermen, who were scrutinized for political violence, the RU/RCP was targeted solely for its Maoist ideology. Membership estimates for the RU/RCP ranged from 300 in 1971 to 750 in 1975, though these figures may understate the group's actual size.

https://preview.redd.it/kxrrfz58nu6e1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=766f2cbfafc032b620c156fbcbf72dea515ecea5

There is a contrast among the Revolutionary Union (RU) and Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), the largest Maoist groups, and others like the October League (OL), Communist League (CL), Puerto Rican Revolutionary Workers Organization (PRRWO), and Black Workers Congress (BWC). FBI records indicate these groups were smaller than initially perceived, with the OL having around 150-200 members in 1974, the CL fewer than 200, and the PRRWO dwindling to 40 by the mid-1970s. These organizations often operated modestly out of personal residences, reflecting their limited scale despite their ideological ambitions. Additionally, informants and FBI operations, such as those involving the Ad Hoc Committee, actively sowed confusion and hindered unity among these groups.

https://preview.redd.it/m2saubb9nu6e1.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=798bf41a8d12a8b5e5affabd535d920b57793df8

Max Elbaum’s Revolution in the Air is framed under ""Third World Marxism,"" though Maoism was the predominant influence, providing a coherent and radical framework distinct from Soviet-aligned Marxism. Maoism's ideological dominance during this period was tied to its revolutionary appeal and critique of the USSR. However, the notion of a unified ""Third World Marxism"" is considered an oversimplification, obscuring Maoism's role in shaping the most radical communist factions.

China's relationship with U.S. Maoist groups was nuanced. While China appeared to favor the RU during the early 1970s, records suggest it encouraged broader unity among leftist factions. Internal turmoil in China, such as the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution and rapprochement with the United States, limited cohesive support for any specific group. After Mao, the October League, rebranded as the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPML), briefly gained favor under Hua Guofeng but faded with China's shift under Deng Xiaoping and the dissolution of its Maoist legacy.

Individuals like Leibel Bergman and Steve Hamilton voiced dissent against the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and protested the Vietnam War, reflecting broader ideological opposition to government policies and the struggle for respect and moral integrity. By 1968, communism in the U.S. was fragmented, with groups such as the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and Trotskyist factions lacking cohesive revolutionary strategies and influence. Despite this disarray, a new generation of Marxist-Leninists, especially those influenced by Maoist ideologies, emerged, viewing armed revolution as essential for achieving socialism.

While these movements lacked a unified party, they played a catalytic role in radicalizing dissent during the transformative 1960s. Young radicals collaborated with older leftist figures, striving to forge doctrines for revolution. Although historians often downplay the influence of revolutionary communists during this era, the government viewed them as potential existential threats, dedicating significant resources to surveillance and suppression. This proactive state response included breaking laws to undermine and neutralize these forces, showcasing the intense political environment of the time.

By 1968, revolutionary communism in the U.S. seemed fragmented and weak as an organized force. Groups such as the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), Trotskyist factions, and splinter organizations struggled to achieve cohesion or political impact. Despite their disarray, a new generation of Marxist-Leninists emerged, shaped by the student movement and inspired by Maoist ideologies. These radicals sought to develop revolutionary doctrines and considered armed revolution as a necessary step towards socialism. Although their goals may have seemed ambitious or impractical, they catalyzed more militant dissent and shaped the trajectory of protest movements.

The friction at the SDS convention increased with the appearance of Black Panther Party representatives, who made controversial remarks about ""pussy power,"" leading to chants and catcalls against their sexism. The ultimate split occurred when a Black Panther Party representative challenged SDS to deal with its internal factions, prompting the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) to walk out and resolve to expel the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). The FBI's strategy aimed to push SDS towards militant extremism, making it easier to neutralize. This approach was evident in the Weathermen's ""Days of Rage"" protest in October 1969, which resulted in numerous arrests and highlighted the perils of go-it-alone voluntarism. The PLP/Worker Student Alliance took control of the SDS name but became increasingly marginal due to their opposition to key issues like the Vietnam War and the Black Panther Party. The FBI continued to exacerbate divisions between the RU and the PLP, suggesting schemes to stress their relations with the Chinese. Despite the collapse of SDS, the RU emerged with expanded political prestige and the basis for organizational growth, becoming a disciplined organization of militant domestic Maoists.

Bob Avakian's confrontation with Weatherman Howard Machtinger at the Weatherman ""War Council"" in December 1969 highlighted the sharp ideological divide between the RU and the Weathermen. Avakian argued that white workers were oppressed by capitalism before they were racists, while Machtinger countered that this view reflected Avakian's racial origins. This exchange underscored the fundamental disagreement over the role of the working class in the revolutionary movement. The RU, having navigated the rift in SDS, focused on building a radical community organization in Richmond, targeting local factory workers, the unemployed, and students. Their strategy emphasized serving the people and fostering political understanding. Avakian's attendance at the Weatherman ""War Council"" and subsequent trip to New York to engage with the Weathermen revealed the RU's efforts to influence the revolutionary movement, though they ultimately diverged from the Weathermen's strategy of violence.

In 1969, the Goffs began working as FBI informants within the Revolutionary Union (RU). Their story became widely known when they testified before the US House of Representatives Committee on Internal Security in October 1971. Lawrence ""Larry"" Goff infiltrated the RU through the Radical Action Movement and quickly rose to a position of leadership within the organization. He recruited his wife into the RU, and both gained access to internal documents and security protocols. Larry's testimony revealed the RU's policies, including their approach to the draft during the Vietnam War. The RU would assess the usefulness of drafted members, determining whether they would be more valuable within the Armed Forces or continuing their activities at home.

Larry Goff's involvement in the RU was short-lived but impactful. He attended a gun show in Los Angeles, taking orders for weapons from RU members, and served as the RU's ""gunsmith."" The Goffs' time in the RU ended due to internal struggles over the role of violence and concerns about exposing their children to the revolutionary environment. However, the intelligence they provided to the FBI was extensive and damaging.

1he7ukx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1he7ukx,"Tate's victims - two former members of the cult founded by the ""Beatles guru"" explain why the influencer investigated in Romania is dangerous ","'After being part of a group in their youth that claimed people could levitate or bring about world peace through meditation, Joe Kelly and Patrick Ryan, from the US city of Philadelphia, now help others escape abusive cults. One of the cases they are working on is a 21-year-old from a wealthy family who is fascinated by Andrew Tate.

• Together with psychologists, psychiatrists and other specialists, Patrick and Joe develop strategies for the families of people who have been brainwashed so that they can escape the influence of the leaders of controversial groups. 

• These two spoke with the HotNews journalist in Philadelphia.

I met Joe Kelly (69) and Patrick Ryan (67) in a hipster coffee shop in the neighborhood where they live. Joe and Patrick are a couple who are what are called “ cult interventionists ” or “deprogrammers.” That is, they help people get out of abusive cults: they say they “deprogram” them, after they have been brainwashed by charismatic leaders who, most of the time, are nothing more than scammers.""

What exactly does a ""cult intervention specialist"" do?

"" ... Joe Kelly says he basically helps families develop strategies, along with psychiatrists, psychologists and other specialists, to communicate with loved ones who have become involved in these controversial groups.

""It's not a standard procedure, it varies from case to case, but we ask about 85 questions to see if we're a good fit to help them. Then, if we conclude that we can get involved, we do an assessment, which takes about eight hours, like 'where are you from, what's your relationship with your family members, etc. We also interview your family members to see what the dynamics are between them,'"" Joe explains how the first interactions with those who have been victims of an abusive cult go. 

The two say they turn to all kinds of specialists to help them in their endeavor because cults are also very different. For example, in cases of ""sex cults"", they turn to experts specializing in sex therapy. 

I'm curious if Joe and Patrick need a license for their work and how many people they've helped in their work. They tell me they don't need to get a license, as long as the specialized help provided to victims and their families comes from people with the necessary training. 

""The services we provide for the families who call on us are not cheap at all because the experts we call on are not cheap. In addition to this, we volunteer for non-profit organizations and also hold online workshops for families who cannot afford to pay these amounts,"" explains Patrick, who estimates that ""hundreds of people a year"" benefit in one form or another from their help.""

Why do people get involved in cults?

"" ...
I ask Patrick and Joe why they think people get involved in these cults. What needs do they have that they can't meet otherwise?
Patrick says that, in his experience, neither a person's wealth, education, or intelligence matters. 

""Generally, they are not satisfied with their lives and want a better one. They start reading about other people who have been helped by certain 'gurus', they go to seminars without knowing what the agenda of that seminar is. But many times, the problems are in the family,"" explains Patrick.

Regarding the differences between cults from the 80s, 90s, and today's, the two interventionists say that before the advent of the internet, the number of members of such a group was much higher, 10 million people, ""like Scientologists, for example.""
""Now the groups are much smaller, because people can Google and find out things about that group or leader: 'look, there's a problem here,'"" says Patrick.

Joe believes that ""aesthetic"" is the word that best defines their work because what they do most is help families understand why some members value something that they cannot understand. Only in this way can they be convincing to those who have been seduced by a particular cult.  

""If you come to my house and see a painting on the wall and say, 'What an ugly painting,' then where do we end up? On the other hand, if you say, 'What an interesting composition, but I wonder why the artist wanted to do that?' then it's a completely different matter. We try to teach families to appreciate what their loved ones appreciate, and then they will have a chance of success,"" concludes Patrick.""

Almost everyday ako may coffee from starbucks bc he knows I love coffee. 

Every month may nare-receive akong flowers sakanya kasi gusto niya raw gawin Dangwa kwarto ko. Lahat ng binibigay niya na flowers, mga favorite flowers ko na nabanggit ko lang before noong talking stage palang kami. 

Binibili niya rin ako ng mga gamit na kahit hindi ko naman kailangan, basta raw cute and alam niya na magugustuhan ko, binibili niya na.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The quest for effective weight loss strategies can often lead us to explore various health trends. One such trend that has gained popularity in recent years is hydrogen water. Many people wonder, ""Can hydrogen water help with weight loss?"" To answer this question, we must delve into the science behind hydrogen water and its potential effects on weight management.

Hydrogen water is simply water that has been infused with molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas. Proponents argue that hydrogen water boasts various health benefits, including improved hydration, enhanced energy levels, and antioxidant properties. These claims have triggered curiosity about its role in weight loss.

One of the primary arguments favoring hydrogen water for weight loss revolves around its ability to reduce inflammation. Inflammation can lead to weight gain and make it harder for the body to shed pounds. By consuming hydrogen-rich water, you might help your body combat oxidative stress, potentially paving the way for easier weight loss. Below are some key points regarding the potential benefits:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Hydrogen water may lower inflammation markers in the body.
- It could improve recovery times after exercise.
- Hydrogen-infused water is thought to enhance metabolic processes.
- It can support overall health by providing antioxidants.

Although many of these claims sound promising, it is essential to consider the scientific evidence supporting hydrogen water’s effectiveness for weight loss. Research in this area is still relatively limited. Some studies suggest that hydrogen-rich water may improve exercise performance. This can be particularly beneficial if you’re incorporating physical activity into your weight loss journey.

Improved exercise performance is critical because engaging in regular physical activity is vital for effective weight management. When you can push through workouts more comfortably, you may find that you can exercise longer or take on more intense workouts, which can contribute to weight loss over time.

Furthermore, hydration plays a significant role in weight loss. Staying well-hydrated can help control hunger, boosting your chance of making healthy dietary choices. Hydrogen water might not only quench your thirst but also provide additional benefits, potentially making it a more appealing option than regular water for some people.

However, it's crucial to recognize that no single beverage—be it hydrogen water or any other drink—miraculously causes weight loss. A healthy diet and consistent exercise are the cornerstones of effective weight management. If you are exploring hydrogen water as an addition to your routine, think of it as a complement rather than a substitute for a balanced diet and exercise.

Moreover, the weight loss industry is riddled with myths and misconceptions. It’s essential to approach any new regimen with a skeptical mind. While there is increasing interest and anecdotal support for hydrogen water, more extensive research is needed to understand its long-term effects on health and weight loss adequately.

If you’re intrigued by hydrogen water, consider trying it but keep realistic expectations. Here are some tips for incorporating hydrogen water into your lifestyle:

While hydrogen water presents some intriguing possibilities, its role in weight loss remains uncertain. It holds potential benefits, particularly regarding hydration and exercise performance, but further evidence is required before it can be hailed as a weight-loss miracle. Always prioritize a holistic approach, combining dietary changes with physical activity to achieve your weight loss goals. If you find that hydrogen water enhances your experience and keeps you invested in healthy habits, it might be worth including in your lifestyle.

How Hydrogen Water Boosts Metabolism: The Science Behind It
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen water has gained popularity as a health trend, especially among those looking for weight loss solutions. But what is hydrogen water, and how does it claim to boost metabolism? The science behind hydrogen water lies in its unique properties and the way it interacts with your body's systems. Let's delve deeper into how hydrogen-infused water may help you boost your metabolism and support your weight loss journey.

### What is Hydrogen Water?

Hydrogen water is simply water that has been infused with molecular hydrogen (H₂).

Examining the **before and after results** of teeth whitening can provide insights into the transformative effects these treatments have on your smile.

Visibly whiter teeth can significantly enhance your self-esteem. Think about it: when you see someone smile confidently, you naturally feel drawn to them. Having bright teeth can change not just your appearance, but your overall demeanor. You might find that you smile more often, which can lead to creating a positive perception among your friends and peers.

Different whitening methods are available, each offering unique benefits. Let's take a closer look:

- **Professional In-Office Whitening:** This option often provides the most immediate results. Dental professionals utilize high-concentration bleaching agents along with laser or light enhancement, giving you a noticeable difference in just one visit.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits contain lower concentrations of whitening agents compared to in-office treatments. While results may take longer to appear, they can be effective with regular use and are convenient for many.
- **Whitening Toothpastes:** Many toothpaste brands now boast whitening properties. However, their effectiveness can be limited. You'll see minor changes, mainly because they contain mild abrasives and chemicals that help remove surface stains.

Examining the **before and after** images of those who have undergone teeth whitening treatments reveals dramatic transformations. Individuals may often go from dull, yellowish teeth to a bright, radiant smile that stands out. Popular social media platforms often showcase these transformations, inspiring others to consider whitening treatments.

So, what causes teeth to become stained and discolored in the first place? Several factors contribute to this common issue:

- **Diet:** Foods like coffee, red wine, berries, and sauces can stain your teeth over time.
- **Tobacco:** Smoking or chewing tobacco can lead to persistent discoloration.
- **Age:** As you age, the outer layer of enamel wears away, revealing the natural yellow color of dentin.
- **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Inadequate brushing and flossing can lead to plaque buildup, which can also stain teeth.

Choosing to whiten your teeth is not only about aesthetics; it can bring psychological benefits as well. Many feel more self-assured in both professional and social scenarios after seeing their **before and after** results. You may even notice that people are more inclined to interact with you when you sport a bright smile.

Nevertheless, it’s essential to approach teeth whitening with caution. Overusing whitening products can lead to tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. Always consult your dentist before starting any whitening regimen to ensure you choose the most appropriate method for you.

After you undergo teeth whitening, maintaining those results is key. Here are some tips to help you keep your smile sparkling:

- **Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Visiting your dentist every six months ensures your oral health remains in check.
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Moderation is key; consider limiting intake of coffee, tea, and similar beverages.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily to prevent stain buildup.

The **before and after** results of teeth whitening treatments can be nothing short of amazing. The power of a brighter smile can transform self-confidence and improve interactions with others. By understanding the options available and the care needed post-treatment, you can enjoy the benefits of whiter teeth for many years to come.

### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

One of the fundamental practices for preserving your white smile is to maintain a rigorous oral hygiene routine. Here’s how:

- **Brush Twice Daily:** Use a fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth at least twice a day. Brushing helps remove food particles and plaque that can discolor your teeth.
- **Floss Daily:** Flossing removes debris from between your teeth, preventing stains from buildup and ensuring your smile stays bright.
- **Mouthwash:** Incorporate an antibacterial mouthwash into your routine. This can help eliminate bacteria and freshen your breath while also preventing discoloration.

### Limit Staining Foods and Beverages

Certain foods and drinks are notorious for causing discoloration. To protect your smile, consider the following:

- **Coffee and Tea:** Both beverages contain tannins that can lead to staining. If you do consume them, rinse your mouth with water afterward.
- **Red Wine:** The rich pigments in red wine can cause noticeable stains. Drink white wine or water instead, or consume red wine in moderation.
- **Dark Berries:** While healthy, berries like blueberries and blackberries can stain your teeth. Enjoy these in moderation and brush after consumption.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water is essential for overall health, but it can also help maintain your white teeth. Here's how:

- **Rinse After Meals:** Drinking water after eating can help wash away food particles and acids that can stain your teeth.
- **Limit Sugary Drinks:** Frequent consumption of sugary beverages can not only stain your teeth but also lead to decay. Choose water as your primary drink.

### Regular Dental Check-ups

Keeping up with regular dental visits is crucial for maintaining your white smile. Here’s what to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional Cleanings:** Scheduling cleanings every six months can remove any build-up and keep your teeth looking fresh.
- **Consult Your Dentist:** Talk to your dentist about your whitening treatment and ask for recommendations on maintaining your results.

### Touch-Up Treatments

Even with great care, the effects of teeth whitening can fade over time. Here are some strategies to keep in mind:

- **At-Home Kits:** Many dentists offer take-home whitening kits. These allow for safe, gradual touch-ups of your smile.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Consider using a whitening toothpaste to help maintain brightness without over-treating your teeth.

### Be Mindful of Bad Habits

Some habits can undo your hard work in achieving a bright smile. Here’s what to watch out for:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Smoking:** Tobacco not only stains your teeth but can also lead to gum disease, which further detracts from a healthy smile.
- **Chewing Ice:** This habit can damage your enamel and make your teeth more susceptible to staining. Choose to munch on something less harmful instead.

By following these tips, you can significantly prolong the effects of your teeth whitening treatment. Taking proactive steps towards oral care will help you maintain your sparkling smile for years to come. Remember, a healthy smile not only reflects your appearance but also your well-being.

You can see them in my post history. I purchased items to cleanse my house but admittedly, when nothing happened for a few weeks and as I got busier with my jobs, I let the cleansing fall by the wayside. 

I woke up around 10:30 this morning after a late closing shift at one of my jobs last night. I lounged in bed (like we all do sometimes) for about 20 minutes, petting my cat and listening to my tv show with my eyes closed. By the time I got up, my body was tired, but my mind was pretty awake. As an aside, I spent about 15 years waking up at 3 am for my job/s. When I’m awake, I’m *awake.* I’m pretty sharp right off the bat as a result of literally having to be on the GO first thing for so long. 

In one of my last posts, someone commented about hypnopompic hallucinations. I have researched this now and asked a couple of therapists about it. Truly I would have been willing to (and glad to) accept this response had this just happened the one (first) time. But with everything else, I am not. 

This morning after my lounging, I got out of bed, put on my slippers, started water on the stove for my coffee, fed my cat and pet him, opened all of my floor to ceiling, heavy blinds to let in the sun, answered several texts, and changed shows on my tv. By this point, my water was boiling. I use a pour over, so I slowly poured the water over the coffee grounds, measured out my sweetener, checked the expiration date on my half and half, and poured it in. I tell you all this to illustrate the point that no, I was not half asleep. 

As I was stirring my coffee on the small countertop right to the side of my sink containing four dirty dishes from last night, there was a giant crash of dishes. Nothing broken, just that jarring sharp noise of plates and cups toppling over against each other in the sink. 
Except that nothing in my sink had moved. No dishes were even touching each other in the first place. 

At this point I am pretty frustrated. This has now eclipsed the rest of my morning and I haven’t been able to relax. I’ll be doing my cleansing tomorrow when I have my one single day off a week, so I can dedicate my full mind and spirit and all the time I want  into the practice. I guess this is just to update on further happenings and to create something of a “paper trail” (on the internet lol, yes I know that’s not a paper trail) for myself. I plan on talking to my doctor too, just to cover every base. This isn’t cute or funny to me, Im not aiming for upvotes or for people to find me interesting or mysterious. I honestly wanted input from this community and what I’ve gotten is “good luck” from most and “you’re imagining it” from one person. I do appreciate the well wishes.

I believe that using creatine for two months affected my methylation cycle. I had a rough month and after a while I started to get better. I did some research and found that if you're over mehtylated you could take niacin to help get rid of excess methyl groups. From what I read I thought I was over methylated. So I tried to take some niacin, I took about 250 - 300 mg of inositol hexaniacinate (which is niacin and inositol, I got it from walmart) and within about an hour I was WIRED. Like I felt how I did when all of this started. I got very anxious. Couldn't sit still, couldn't think, racing thoughts. After I got home I was still anxious, but then something weird happened. I felt like I lost all feeling, I didn't want to do anything. I've been using doom scrolling as a way to help me cope, cause the stupid videos keep my mind off my issues. But I didn't even want to scroll, I didn't want to do anything. I felt like I was just there. Feeling anxious and that's it. No pleasure from anything. I forced my anxious self to eat some ground beef and within 30 minutes I felt all of the problems dissipate. I went to sleep, got up and had some coffee. I then had some more ground beef and a whole bunch of kidney beans and random foods. The feeling of emotional blunting came back twice. It was miserable. But, today I'm fasting and feel like I did before I took the niacin. Could that have affected my methylation cycle that much that I had such intense emotional swings?

I hope we can be kind to one another here. I'm turning 50 in a few weeks. I was born with depression as my parents were ab*sive gaslighters and did atrocious things to me. I've struggled with major, debilitating depression my entire life. But I'm an expert at hiding it because it repels other people and I'm an overachiever (to compensate for my emptiness). 

Throughout my 20s-30s, I was climbing the ranks in tech and got burnt out. In my 40s, I started over unconventional and started my own small business in another country. It was basically helping the people of that country book travel/tours in the US. It was never a success, but I could pay for basic necessities, enjoy being my own boss, live in another country, and had potential for growth. But it fizzled out from 2020 due to corona. Eventually, I had to shutter my meager 1-person band operations and reevaluate my next move. 

In 2022, I returned to the states broke with my tail between my legs. For the past 2 years, I've been extremely busy trying to rebuild my life, and grinding on the job search.

That in itself has been putting me in the worst hell of depression I couldn't ever have imagined. Six hours a day job searching, attending webinars and networking events weekly, ""bribing"" random LinkedIn contacts I lost touch with years ago for coffee chats which I can't even afford but putting on my credit card, tailoring and retailoring my resumes, etc.

BUT, not getting anywhere and still no job and no income 2 years in, and still stuck with grief and in a midlife crisis to compound things. I'm a zero in life because I've lost all motivation and will to live. 

Let's face it, I've never had passion for anything because I've always lived in survival mode, so that was never in the cards. I fucking hate it when people try to encourage me by asking, ""what are you passionate about? What do you like? What is your dream job?"" Like, bitch, if I knew, I wouldn't be in this mess. 

I have no family or friends. I joined a couple social clubs and a volunteer organization, but nobody is interested in formulating meaningful friendships, which I get. 

But basically, I'm now going on year 3 of spinning my wheels and not going anywhere. Not having ANYTHING to show for myself. Age 50 and jobless, single, broke, and no friends.

Had I known that my life these last 2 years would've been utterly wasted and futile as know now, I honestly wish I would've spent them the way I TRULY wanted. That is, to sleep off my burnout and truly just veg out in bed. But I never truly allowed myself to decompress, and maybe that's my fault because I'm always anxious to achieve and lift myself out of this mental hell.

I HONESTLY wish I didn't waste (yes, WASTE) 2 years of going to the gym, meeting nobody in networking events and clubs, taking random Udemy classes for self-growth, and especially all my job search and networking efforts. I'm just exhausted and wish I'd had honored my body by resting in bed rather than self-flagellating myself to further burnout.

Please, nobody comment, ""you're doing your best! That's great you've been getting yourself out there!"" Maybe that's helpful to 99% of the world, but I feel completely empty and that I'll honestly never get out of this depression. The last 2 years have been 2 steps forward, 2 trillion miles yanked backward. 

At this point, I hope it will not be too much for me to ask you not to write overly mean comments. I've been ""ideating"" since I was a child, but now as a 50 year old f*cking loser, worthless piece of shit who can't even land a part time or seasonal job at Kohl's, I truly believe I have no hope or reason to l*ve. 

And I swear, if someone says ""have you tried therapy?"" I will lose it. Yes, I have had over 20 therapists in my life and they've all been useless. Two even told me I'm better off d*ad. Another encouraged my eating disorder because I'm not a ""lard ass."" Several were clockwatchers, and most admitted that I literally knew more than that did and couldn't help me. And even though therapy is complete BS to me, I tried again these last 2 years but can't secure even though I've called over 500 clinics due to insurance reasons, not accepting new patients, or booked through the next year. And yes, I've tried reaching out to low cost, intern clinics in community service offices, and they're also unavailable. Don't even mention BetterHelp (or again, therapy at all), because the couple of times I've tried, one ate lunch during our session and the other was texting on their phone the whole time.

But hey, at least you're rocking the same watch as a thousand Instagram influencers who bought it for the clout and the unboxing video. 

And let’s talk about that Roman numeral aesthetic. It's a bold choice to go full *ancient Rome* on a modern timepiece, but nothing says *'I'm classy'* like a 12 that’s been split in two for a logo.

It’s the Swiss army knife of Rolex watches: functional, recognizable, and boring as hell. You bought a Rolex, but somehow, it’s the one nobody ever asks about at a party.

And that cyclops lens? Iconic, sure, if you love making your watch look like it’s wearing prescription glasses.  Let’s not forget the fluted bezel. Oh, it’s “classic,” alright—classic like the wood paneling in a ‘70s basement. Your wrist is practically screaming *""I closed on a mortgage today!""* Congratulations, you’ve officially bought the Toyota Camry of luxury watches. Reliable, well-made, and guaranteed to be parked next to five others just like it wherever you go.

Manual winding? Oh, how quaint. Nothing screams *“technological marvel”* like a movement that makes you work harder than the Apollo astronauts just to keep it ticking. And don’t even get me started on the Hesalite crystal. Wow, what a bold choice—a plastic dome on a $7,000 watch. *Truly* the innovation NASA intended. You could replace it with a milk jug and no one would notice.

Ah, the Casio G-Shock GW-M5610U-1, the watch equivalent of a personality crutch, worn by the kind of guy who prides himself on *""function over form""* as if anyone's impressed by a wrist full of plastic. You tell yourself it’s about durability, but let’s be honest—you’ve never been in a situation that calls for ""military-grade toughness,"" unless we’re counting dropping your fries in the car.

 You probably spent hours researching the *“perfect everyday watch,”* only to land on the horological equivalent of cargo shorts. The G-Shock GW-M5610U-1 isn’t just a watch—it’s a safe space for men terrified of choosing something with actual style or self-expression. Because heaven forbid someone looks at your wrist and thinks, *“He has taste,”* instead of, *“He’s really into survival shows on Netflix.”*

The acrylic crystal? Easy to buff out scratches, because you don’t baby your watch; you wear it into battle, whether that's fixing your car or wrestling your neighbor's dog.

While other watches are screaming for attention with their *“heritage-inspired”* nonsense, the Amphibia just sits there, quietly ticking away, doing what it’s supposed to do: telling the time and making you look like a man who actually knows how to use a wrench. You don’t need a Spring Drive, a helium escape valve, or a cyclops lens. You need a Vostok Amphibia

Buyer-driven commodity chains are controlled by large retailers, brand-name merchandisers, and trading companies. These firms dictate product design and volume, while production occurs via contracts with independent factories that manufacture finished goods under OEM arrangements. This model is common in labor-intensive consumer goods industries like garments, footwear, toys, electronics, housewares, and handcrafted items. Key buyers include brands like Nike, Starbucks, and retailers like Target, Walmart, and Amazon. This distinction between producer- and buyer-driven chains reflects industry type and labor relations, with a recent shift towards buyer-driven, more flexible production. This flexibility, however, is not a new phenomenon but rather a recurring feature of historical capitalism. These changing chain structures impact capital-state relations, business-labor dynamics, surplus distribution, and development where chain infrastructure is located.

A ""raw materialist-lengthened GCC"" approach emphasizes the upstream end of commodity chains, focusing on material processes of economic ascent in the capitalist world economy. This ascent involves a state and its economy developing increasing economic, political, and military power. This analysis of economic ascent over the past four centuries (Great Britain, the United States, Japan, and China) reveals a consistent pattern: rapid development rested on fundamental raw materials-based industries, particularly iron and steel, and transport industries. A key challenge for rapidly growing economies has been securing increasing volumes of raw materials. Economies of scale in resource extraction, processing, and transport offer competitive advantages, but raw material depletion and increasing distance create diseconomies of space. Overcoming this contradiction relies on creating generative sectors: industries that create backward and forward linkages, stimulate technical skills and learning, and foster financial systems. These industries drive economic growth, but their development is a complex process. These growth processes and competition with existing hegemons drove long-term change in the capitalist world economy. Successful cases restructure and globalize the world economy, incorporating and reshaping economies, ecosystems, and space.

This raw materialist model begins with raw material/agricultural extraction, tracing processing and commercial, transport, and communication technologies linking chain nodes. This approach analyzes economic, social, and environmental dimensions at each node, examining spatially based disarticulations and contestations. It also analyzes development trajectories and sociopolitical conflicts over cost and benefit distribution. This model emphasizes long-term historical change and allows world-systemic comparative analysis.

Arabica coffee, native to Ethiopia, gained popularity in Yemen before 1500, becoming a trade good. It spread through the Islamic world, with coffee houses replacing taverns. Initially, it was a trader-driven chain involving Arab and Indian merchants. By the early 18th century, European merchant companies shifted to production in their colonies, creating extractive peripheries. By the 1770s, most production was in the Americas. By 1800, coffee was widespread. After the 1870s, merchants and planters became the primary drivers of expansion.

19^(th) century coffee differed from other commodities like sugar and cotton, which were largely controlled by colonial powers. Coffee's low technological demands allowed independent Brazil to become a major producer. Cheap land and slave labor allowed Brazil to lower world prices after 1820. Lower prices expanded the market to middle- and working-class consumers. Brazil’s success resulted from developments in consuming countries and the world market, including growing urban markets, capital, transportation, and communication revolutions, and British free-trade hegemony. Larger plantations established cultivation standards and enjoyed economies of scale. The commodity chain was hybrid, partially producer- and partially trader-driven. Low export taxes in Brazil and the elimination of US import duties stimulated consumption.

The 19^(th) century saw significant expansion of the world coffee economy, driven by Brazil’s internal resources, foreign labor, transportation and communication advances, and transformations in marketing and logistics. The shipping revolution significantly impacted the coffee chain, influencing which areas could participate in the world economy. Other Latin American countries also benefited from growing demand, increasing output and attracting more consumers. Brazil became a market and price maker. Coffee was one of the few commodities with a real price increase and per-capita consumption increase in the late nineteenth century, benefiting from lower staple prices. The commodity chain also involved considering competing goods. After coffee’s status shifted from luxury to necessity, its income elasticity changed. After World War II, other caffeinated drinks emerged, but specialty coffee later regained popularity.

Social practices in the US and Germany influenced demand and roasters’ responses. Coffee consumption in homes led to the rise of brand names and industrial-scale roasters. Roasters became manufacturers, selling trademarked products. This vertical integration characterized twentieth-century Fordism. Large brands also integrated vertically, sometimes buying plantations. A&P was a prime example, controlling multiple chain segments. Supermarkets gained increasing control over the chain. Value increasingly shifted to consuming countries as household coffee preparation declined. By 1935, most US coffee was sold roasted and packaged.

Until the late 19^(th) century, coffee was sold as a raw material. Industrialization of processing, roasting, canning, and branding added value in consuming countries in the twentieth century. Value added in consuming countries increased significantly. Roasters favored stable prices, accepting state-run price controls and international agreements. Governance of the chain was largely in the hands of state agencies. Industrialization and economies of scale increased value added in consuming countries. New products like decaffeinated and instant coffee emerged. This led to lower quality coffee and the rise of large companies producing it. The chain became increasingly buyer-driven as supermarkets and food conglomerates gained market power. By the 1980s, a few companies controlled most of the US market.

Neoliberalism led to the dissolution of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989, further reducing state governance. Companies like Nestlé gained greater control. The specialty coffee movement emerged, creating value in service quality. Starbucks became a major player, educating consumers about higher-quality coffee at higher prices. While specialty coffee’s volume is smaller, its higher prices give it a significant market share. These coffee houses have spread globally. However, much of the revenue from specialty coffee goes to additives, rent, and profits, not coffee growers.

I'm 35 and I've been alone forever. I have a small immediate family that cares about me but I've never found intimacy or connection with another person. I've fallen for a number of women over the years but my feelings are always unrequited. I don't blame the women; they're wonderful people who I would love to share experiences with.

I'm not very attractive, I'm shy and reserved, I've never been very confident, and until my late twenties I wasn't very good at smalltalk. I'm still not great at it. I earn and spend very modestly and have perfect financial stability, but I don't have a career and can only afford to live in a low cost-of-living area. I'm well-educated but wasn't able to complete a college degree. 

I used to bear setbacks with patience, but now each one comes with the added anxiety of the passage of time. So much time has passed and it seems to pass faster every day. The thought of being young and in love and discovering life with a partner is an increasingly unrealistic dream. I'm having a hard time fighting off a sense of resignation and frankly, thoughts of suicide. My therapist seemed to sense a change in my mood and outlook at our last session and for the first time in a while she seemed particularly concerned. 

I've always wanted to meet someone by chance, through a shared activity or interest just like many of my friends, but opportunities are extremely rare; sometimes years apart. Recently, for the first time in years, I met a woman who is smart and ambitious and nerdy and fell for her almost immediately. There are so many reasons why it can't work: she's smart, ambitious, confident and well-adjusted. Most importantly she's 10 years younger than me. I feel so desperate and weak for allowing my thoughts and emotions to assail me like this. I'm trapped in a nightmare and I want it to end. I've spent my whole life viewing beauty, joy, and love from within a glass box.

Now I'm here screaming into the void because I don't know what else to do. I want to be there for someone else, I want to channel this energy into something good. I am so tired of being alone.",1,1734196221.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

>Because you can now create member accounts without root credentials from the start, you no longer need to apply additional security measures like MFA after account provisioning. Accounts are secure by default, which drastically reduces security risks associated with long-term root access and helps simplify the entire provisioning process.

Fantastic, right? Except *someone* forgot to tell Security Hub, which still insists on triggering **Missing root user MFA** findings—even when root credentials *don’t exist*.

Now, I get it, standards take time to update, committees need to meet, coffee must be consumed, and scrolls of bureaucracy must be unrolled. But in the meantime, could we get a quick fix?

Here’s a humble suggestion: since you already [let us](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user-privileged-task.html#root-user-privileged-task_action-api) \`DeactivateMfaDevice\` and \`DeleteVirtualMfaDevice\`, how about also letting us \`CreateVirtualMfaDevice\`?

You can even take it away later when you finally give us a give us a way to silence these checks more elegantly.

1he7bit,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1he7bit/breast_engorgements_without_end/,Breast Engorgements without end,"Dear community, I'm hoping for a few experiences and maybe even tips. My son will be four months old next week. Breastfeeding didn't go so well at first; he didn't latch on properly in hospital, which is why I was given a breastfeeding shield there. I was then discharged with a milk blockage and my midwife gave it her all, but unfortunately this was followed by the first breast infection. After eight weeks and a second breast infection (which also meant two antibiotics in three weeks) as well as various milk blockages and two breastfeeding consultations, after eight weeks we managed to get him to take the breast without any problems and to latch on correctly. It was a really bad time for me, but also for us as a family.

Things have improved in the meantime, but the slightest ""stress"" such as Trips to our families or lots of visitors immediately causes my milk to build up again. I also regularly take lecithin, don't drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks, etc. In the beginning there was still the problem of ""too much milk"" and hardening in the breasts, but this is now much better. What hasn't changed: my breasts are always red, with or without engorgement.

Now I'm lying on the sofa again with engorgement, this time in both breasts, and don't know what to do. The milk blockages will go away, I know that. But I wake up every morning with the fear that my milk will come in again. This is not the first time I have considered weaning - have you had similar experiences?

The first time it happened was during installing the water filter, at step 1, the screen went black and the unit was completely unresponsive. I turned the power off and on at the wall to restart it manually.  
  
I attempted it again and I got to step 4 when the screen went blank again (but the backlight was still on) and the unit was unresponsive. After about a minute it rebooted itself again.  
  
With almost every cup of coffee, the screen goes blank after a few seconds, the coffee is successfully completed, but it is followed by the machine resetting and doing it's priming/cleaning cycle straight away.

Also if the machine is left turned on after making a cup, it will regularly restart and prime itself every few minutes causing all the water to go into the drip tray.

I briefly spoke to Siemens on social media and they recommend sending it in for service, but I just want to see if there's anything I can check at home in case it's an easy fix? Given we're so close to Christmas now I guess a service booking won't be until the new year

1he71qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1he71qk/34f4m_canadaonline_looking_for_friendship/,34[F4M] Canada/online - looking for friendship !,"





Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Thanks for reading :). ",0,1734195225.0,r4r,1,0.38,False
1he70n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1he70n6/im_going_slightly_mad_manual_grinder_keeps_losing/,I'm going slightly mad: manual grinder keeps losing calibration [1zpresso JX-Pro],"Preface: this is my second JX-Pro grinder. I've replaced the first one for the same problem I'm about to describe, and so it seems unlikely that this is the result of a faulty product (it would be quite the coincidence).

The problem.  
For the first month of use, everything went just fine: I regulated the grinder for espresso, and the JX-Pro consistently ground the coffee beans at the same level.  
After a month, I decided to clean it and re-calibrate it, and again set it to espresso.

But something must have gone wrong because, for months after that, the grinder progressively raised the grinding level by itself. Every 4-6 espresso cups or so, I needed to re-adjust the dial (by 6-8 clicks each time), otherwise the coffee powder would become too thin and ""clog"" my Gaggia Classic.

Weirdly enough, it came a time where, for about 4-5 months, the problem seemed to have gone away (I've never tried de-assembling the grinder during this period for fear that I would ""break the magic"").  
And then one day, the problem mysteriously came back again (and it's still there to this day).

The 1zpresso customer support has been great to me, with a back-n-forth spanning more than one year: they provided suggestions, videos, and documentation.  
In a last-ditch effort to help me, they asked to send them a video of me re-assembling the machine, [which I link here](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0bc0V3VhpWu_qdGVYKEY1XQdA). I would immensely appreciate if someone could give me their opinion (the customer support was positive I did everything correctly).

To close the wall of text: I'm desperate.  
Everyone seems to be in love with this grinder. And I really like the ""grinding ritual"". But I can't deal anymore with what I've just described.

Could someone help me? Pretty please?

P.S. In case useful: my ""zero point"" when I re-assemble the grinder is always the same.",2,1734195139.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I've had a long-standing severe problem with my left foot due to posterior tibial tendonitis and hypermobile feet. The problem has been so severe that I could not stand in one place for more than a minute, especially on hard surfaces. I managed this by 1) doing lots of physical therapy and strength training exercises and 2) sitting and also sitting with my legs out on a coffee table. While it sucked, I was able to manage it as long as I was careful about how much time I was on my feet. I could still walk and do things, including coaching one of my son's sports a couple of times a week.

Recently, I tore my labrum (posterior and anterior with cysts). Sitting has become extremely problematic and I've been using a thick seat wedge and a higher office chair. Unfortunately, this has forced me to put more pressure on my bad foot and its flaring like crazy. Its hard to be on my feet for any time now. I'm concerned my PTTD is going to progress and my entire arch will collapse with arthritis setting in. Additionally, my strength training exercises are out due to the labral tear. I've been doing PT for the hip for the last two months, but it only made things worse. The surgeon I visited with wants me to try another PT for 8 weeks and re-assess. I'm meeting with a podiatrist in early January to see if I can get an AFO brace (I currently have custom orthotics and HOKAa.

Literally, I'm in constant pain and have no idea how to get out of this. Its the first time in my life where I've lost all hope.

I'm 50 years old and do not have arthritis in my hip per the MRI and X-rays.

From what I can tell, surgery seems to make sitting worse for a period of time? What short-term and long-term solutions are there for me? Would hip arthroscopy make things worse for my foot? What would be the best course of action to be able to sit like a normal human again?",1,1734194830.0,HipImpingement,0,1.0,False

1he6who,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1he6who/success_story_but_seeking_advice/,Success story but seeking advice,"I’ve been taking sertraline for 6+ years now.. after going holistic for years trying to resolve mental stuff with limited result, I decided to try ssris. Then it took a few tries to find Zoloft.

Zoloft has been a miracle drug for me, no noticeable side effects and has allowed me to live a normal life.

When I first started taking it, doc and I went up to 250mg and found that as therapeutic dose.

But after several years, and since this is over the recommended dose, and in an effort to go as low as I could with good results, I went down and ultimately settled at 200mg.

Now I’ve been at 200mg for a year or two and have found myself really leaning on stimulants.  

Not quite sure if it’s due to mental clarity or for a bit of motivation, but even living a very clean lifestyle with plenty of exercise, it’s very difficult for me to feel excited about life.

When I talk to my doc next I’m wondering if I should suggest going back to my original therapeutic dose (250), try a supplemental med, or just accept that a lot of coffee and similar is what anyone needs to get going.

Anyone have similar experiences?  Thank you.

She is the breakfast cook so she normally is done around 2:30 and can only take a break from 1:30 to 2:00. I was sitting down enjoying a coffee chatting with two of my coworkers about a Christmas party and she chimes in while chain-smoking and ashes a cigarette on me and was like “you left me a bunch of dirty dishes last night “ in a very snotty way. I told her they weren’t dirty. I just lined them with parchment for you so it’s easier for you to get your job done meanwhile she constantly leaves me a sink full of dishes and a mess behind for me to clean up. Now I brought up these concerns to my manager and he has no care in the world or no support and I told her that I don’t appreciate her attitude and why she needs to stay half hour past her clock out time to follow me out on my break and criticize the way I work now I know she’s undermining me and I feel like there’s nothing I can do to change the way she acts but how would you deal with us?

1he6rg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveHasWonCult/comments/1he6rg2/i_was_in_lhw_in_2018_pt_2/,I was in LHW in 2018 - Pt 2,"**I described what led me to LHW in my first post. Now, I will address your questions about actually being a part of LHW. My memory isn’t perfect, but I’ll do my best to share my experience and answer your questions.**

During my time in LHW, much of what has been speculated online is true. **Animal abuse**? I witnessed it. **Child abuse**? The timeout situations (locking a child in a closet, sometimes with an adult, sometimes alone) happened as reported. **Amy's behavior**? She was drunk and high almost all the time, and when violent, it was about 30-40% of the time, but the violence was mostly verbal.

One instance I remember vividly was when I was talking to Jason in Amy's room while she was lying in bed. She accused me of having “Lilith energy” and told me I had to leave the house. One of the other members “escorted” me to my room to pack my suitcase, but it was clear they were ensuring I left the house. I ended up walking around Dunsmuir for hours and knocked on doors, hoping to find somewhere to sleep. Fortunately, a neighbor let me stay with them for the night, as the group wouldn’t open the door for me when I tried to return. Amy would kick people out frequently. There were a lot of rules, including restrictions on eating (we weren’t supposed to snack) and chores like communal laundry, cooking, and cleaning. These things were more typical, but the environment was far from normal.

Despite the chaos, there were moments of connection and community. We had fun together sometimes—one time, we walked to a park in Dunsmuir, some swam in the river, and others went on swings. Those moments were genuine, and when Amy wasn’t drunk or high, she could be very charismatic. There were also frequent dance parties and nights when we’d watch funny YouTube videos together in her room. Those times were easy to like, when the drugs and violence weren't involved.

And as a disclaimer, some people read my first post and assumed I still believe in this cult, that I condone it or am ""still into it"" just because I spoke of the positive insights I had gained in hindsight. I just want to state that I certainly am not and do not condone this group whatsoever. There was violence, manipulation, and truly sad things that happened in this group - and worse after I left. But what's also true is that not *all* the time I spent there was full of these ""bad"" experiences..

Questions:

1. Did you ever see anyone question what Amy claimed to be?

Yes. On the livestreams, members would sometimes call out comments from outside people questioning whether Amy was truly God. The group would laugh at them, claiming that they were wrong and dismissing their concerns. If anyone visited the house and claimed Amy wasn’t mother God, they would be yelled at and kicked out. But those who were in the house didn’t question it, as they had to believe that to be able to stay there.

1. Would you be open to talking about your day-to-day?

We woke up early, around 5–7 a.m., and immediately started working on the website. Coffee and cigarettes were the first part of the day. Some people wrote astrology articles, others did tarot readings, pulled spiritual blog posts from other authors online, or focused on the livestream. Some also worked on the eventual storefront. We took care of house chores like cooking, cleaning, laundry, and caring for the kids. We also ran errands, like grocery shopping or picking up marijuana for Amy in Mt. Shasta. No one had specific, set tasks, but those closest to Amy—like Faith and Hope—had specialized roles. The livestream and supporting Amy were the group’s primary tasks, followed by housework. There were constant power struggles between the men, especially Jason and the other “Father Gods” so we had to deal with those situations sometimes. There was a lot of intersecting dynamics between the people in the house, and it was overwhelming at times - since there was somewhere between 15-20 of us. 

1.  Weren’t you concerned about the alcohol and colloidal silver intake?

When I first joined, I didn’t see much of Amy, so I didn’t witness her drinking or using drugs initially. Over time, though, it became more evident that she was using more and more alcohol and drugs to maintain her role as “Mother God.” We were taught was that she needed them to transmute the density of collective consciousness. We accepted this reasoning because we were “in the movie” of the experience. We didn’t question her behavior because we were immersed in the group’s belief system. We thought her intake was helping her, that it was for good.

1. Also what about the dynamics between Father God and Father God of the multiverse? - Just wondering if there was resentment and how having two father gods was justified, and mostly how FM took the demotion.

There was definitely tension and jealousy between Father God (Jason)  and Father Multiverse (John). FM was younger, coming from a military background I believe, and he saw Jason as a father figure, so their relationship was complicated—sometimes friendly, sometimes competitive. The “Father” role meant power, especially in relation to Amy, and I know Amy had a sexual relationship with Jason, and possibly with Father Multiverse, though I can’t confirm the latter. This dynamic contributed to the power struggles between the two - and there were a lot of those between them. FM was constantly fighting to be back close to Amy’s side. 

1. These spiritual sessions fascinated me as it seemed that it was a way to foment feelings of unworthiness that then needed to be transformed through devotion to Amy. I always wondered if it was Faith who determined all these percentages or if she was just speaking for Amy. Did you have any experience with this? It seemed to me that Faith had a lot of control and influence through this role. I am also curious about how this influenced the group dynamics in the house.

Yes, Faith had significant influence in leading the spiritual sessions and determining the percentages, which were tied to people's donations. Amy wasn’t deeply involved in these sessions, she was present, but Faith led them. In the group overall, Faith didn’t seem to have or try to exert as much control as Jason or others in terms of authority, but her power and influence came through these sessions. 

1. In that post would you mind giving us your thoughts on some of the overt racism the group has/had? The documentary did a great disservice cutting out a lot of those elements. I see you discussing some of the day-to-day, dancing and doing drugs and stuff, but not much about the particular beliefs they had other than that Amy was god? 

While I was there, I didn’t see much overt racism - perhaps because the group hadn’t fully spiraled yet, Amy hadn’t fully spiraled yet. But, I did witness some troubling behavior later on. For example, I remember the group watching a Donald Trump speech where Amy referred to him as a “good guy” who would awaken the masses. This seemed to be a precursor to the racist beliefs that became more prominent after I left.

1. How were you able to be convinced of the words that Amy Carlson ""preached"" (for lack of a better word in my mind atm) to all of her followers? You don't have to answer these following questions, they're simply to help you understand the depth of the answer I'm looking for. Were you in a particularly vulnerable mental/emotional state when you connected to them? Did you, say, grow up with abuse, neglect, or any other trauma that made you maybe vulnerable, or maybe even naive? This is a general question that I've always wanted answered from someone like you who has actually believed the same thing all of the other people in the cult believed, just by hearing it from one person (for you, Amy Carlson)...I ponder how it's so easy for people who lead a ""normal"" life (by normal, i simply mean your lifestyle/spiritual and/or religious beliefs are mostly in line with the majority of citizens in the world) to take a cult leaders word for it when they make these outrageous claims, such as being God. And it's that several, lots of people believe these claims too. Was AC just super convincing? Did seeing all these other people believing her, taking her word for gospel (no pun intended) and being devout followers just give her claims credence?

In my case, it wasn’t about blindly believing Amy’s claims. As I said in my first post, my intuition led me to LHW - not a need for validation from Amy. I was still, however, in a vulnerable state at the time, having gone through significant emotional turmoil. While my intuition was clear, I was immersed in a belief system that forced me to accept certain ideas, like Amy being “Mother God.” However, I never truly believed she was God. It wasn’t about believing it wholeheartedly— for me, it was more about accepting the experience and the beliefs of the group because of the way my intuition guided me to stay.

Also, didn’t realize it came with an auto-off feature after 100 minutes so we are very glad about that.

Confession time!

We didn’t get our whole beans ground up ahead of time and the kiddos were still asleep nearby this morning, so one of us had the bright idea of trying our old Folgers ground coffee in it (for science). Brewed it WAY too strong the first time around so ended up using a lot less on the 2nd pot, and it was the best this (bad I know) coffee has ever tasted! 

Santa is bringing us a small fortune in whole beans thanks to all the recommendations from you all on my last post, so we have a fun adventure ahead of us for our morning routine.

Question for you all… how far ahead of time do you grind your beans? Does anyone grind a bunch up ahead of time and keep in an air-locked container to scoop out as necessary?

I 26 yo female and my bff , lets call her (larry) have been friends for roughly 6 years. She is a few years younger than me (23). For a bit of understanding of us and our friendship and HER:(SORRY FOR THE LONG BACK GROUND)

She has some mental health issues as so i do too but i'm more in control of my actions than she. She makes erratic decisions and burns alot of bridges and ruins alot of friendship, im basically her only friend. I give advice to her on how i accomplished being so in control of my emotions (most of the time ). She doesnt take it !! She has a man she has been obsessed with  since middle school. As children, she ended up trauma bonding him (suicide threats anytime she felt he would walk away from the friend ship). As a adult they started doing the Giggity, but were never officially together. He had 2 kids, 2 different women , multiple relationships but would never pursue her. ( I call this ""playing with her mind"") . 2 Years into our friendship i met this man (Lets call him Corny). Corny was cool a first, didn't seem to bad, (all i heard was neg things about him from her ). Throughout the next year or so on at least once a month she would call me screaming and yelling about how shes is going ot Ki\*\* herself because he would see her ,hang out, had his kid, with is gf, changed plan, wouldn't call her, back, change her tire at a exact time bc his kid wanted food lol etc. The list goes on and on lol. IF i couldnt answer her right then and there ,she would end up at my job or at my house outside ready to do the same to me. i Took a break from after about 6 times of this happening . After a few months go by, i contacted her to get food and talk. We spoke and she agreed to instead act out of anger , breathe and calm down a bit so, 1. i can understand her , and 2. she doesn't make any bad decisions and she can think clearly and logically. . So for a good while lets say 7 o rso months , she was taking her meds and working a few full time jobs at time and ubering and other side jobs. JUST DOING GREAT !! but this is where it got weird , i would ask to hang out but she would say shes broke, but im not the friend to expect you to have money when im inviting , but after 5 hang outs and shes always broek i started asking questions. Come to find out ( drumroll), shes paying CORNY $3K a month for GIGGITYYYYYY. ATP my Flabbers were Gasted more hasted than ever. So i tried to talk her into stopping and explaining beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and there are men who would want to do nothing but love her for who she is but, sh only wants him. And that is when i realised she was obsessed lol . This i nun of my bizz and wasn't for a while but until she called me 5 mins after being released from Jail. Why was she in jail for the first time? after he told her, he couldnt come to pic u pa case of soda and bring it in her house bc he was at a movie wiht his son. She went to his house later that night and busted windows and tires. FAST FORWARD 2 years later , were in 2022, i moved from NY to WV , away from all connections and starting over. i kept in contact with her while being there everyday, picked up calls when she was bugging out and keeping her calm, etc . She went to jail agian in 2023 bc of another scenario ,same man, same anger issues lol

Now to the story:

were are in 2024 , earlier this year, i connected her to my sister , in our city, so she could have a piece of me there. They hung out alot , video called me , trees it down lol . but in the summer she and Her sister got into a argument and larry basically told me she left her sister stranded in the middle of a city she is not familiar with. So i told larry that i was gonna call her sister to see where she was and convince her to get back in the car with her. So upn calling her sister , HER SISTER IS OTP WITH MINE. So she tells me the story (her side). While she is telling her side , Larry beeps in and we add her to the call, and Larry then start threatening us all and , saying crazy things. later o that night Larry went back to my sister house and went ota tree in the back yard and wrapped er apple brand phone charger around a 10 Centimeter branch then held it around her neck and threatened IT agian. I stopped talking ot her from there and my sister called the police , i was on the phone wiht my sister while it all was happening at her house (i live in WV). We hung up after the police left. I came back home to NY 2 months ago to help my elder parents (86). 1 month ago, larry asked me to get coffee one morning , so i agreed so we could talk and honestly i missed her and haven't seen her in 2 years and haven't talked to her in months. So she told me that she was going to bring Corny coffee for his bday, so i told her while she does that ,ill walk 4 block to DD and meet her there , SHE THEN BLEW UP , while i was walking to dunkin she came to my house and told my boyfriend i had a side dude in another city, etc(no he didn't believe her ), screamed at the top of her lungs on the hallway of my apartment ( i stay with my lil boo in a complex ). He said we couldnt be together if i kept being her friend , 1. bc shes not a real friend and 2 . he doesn't want the drama .

So i decided to keep my friendship a secret , met her a few blocks away to hang out and all. Till 2 weeks ago, we were at her boyfriends hose and sisters boyfriends house , she did something really fake and while n one was around i question her about it(let her man driver her car with no license and not with her but told me no even tho when i used to live here she would let me lol) She freaked out and made a scene , i almost drug her down the street , bc at that point i couldnt take it no more , all 6 years of me keeping calm and walking away and just al that stuff i wanted to finally get my lick back.

SOOOOooo

During one of her recent episodes , she messaged me and said she put my SS# on the black market, said she was going to ruin my life and so i posted the screen shot off the black market message as a google review on her job(only BANK with that name in our city) , with contact under her FULL name and BDAY and # . Then called them and acted as if I just closed a account with 1.2 mill , but of how viral she is going on tik tok for being a known scammer. Also might i add, she was a call center rep next door to the bank, so of course i called Customer Service , duhhh, and my the next day she was fired.

I’m a 34 year old male from Brazil, currently living in Haarlem. I moved to the Netherlands about 10 years ago, and being an expat for this long has given me a somewhat unique perspective as over the years, I’ve seen friends (more accurately: colleagues) come and go. This transient nature, combined with feeling like an outsider among locals, has led me to adopt a somewhat defensive stance when it comes to forming connections.

However, I’m now trying to break this pattern, and this message is one of the steps I’m taking to approach things differently.

I’m a software engineer who’s into music production, mental health, gaming, autosports, traveling and dogs! I dislike populism, raves and the taste of coffee 🥲. I’d love to connect with anyone around my age for an initial chat. ☺️

A carbon copy of America, sound familiar?","I'm 22f from the UK, I have two cats and I live with my mum and dad and two brothers And have no real friends not even coworkers are my friends. And I live in an apartment complex because living in the UK is so fucking expensive now, like forget having the luxury of heat. And I just want to say that in the UK it is just as lonely as it is in America. With rampant consumption and having to worry about rent, food, and utility bills. No one here really has the time to go out for a pastry and coffee with friends or chitter chatter about their day, because everyone here is so busy trying to make ends meet. There is no teens or young adults trying to go meet up at the nearest campus and have social groups. The community here is gone... the UK feels so isolating, like a prison sometimes. And no one goes on holidays here, like friends in the UK as of now is a damned luxury same with relationships. It's so depressing here honestly and if you want the luxury of having a friend group you have to make ends meet first. Unfortunately my parents don't understand the loneliness epidemic in the UK as well they think it's only because of ""the technology"" that's only half true. But it's because of capitalism as well and corporate greed. So if anyone is curious about what living in the UK would be like, it's very dystopian and feels like you're constantly having to work to pay those bills first than going out for brunch with friends and having healthy relationships are damn near impossible here. Those days are gone Unfortunately 😪, my only friends are my 2 cats, mittens and teacup. 

(Edit) we have apps here to make online friends and that's how it is. Much like America it's the same damn thing but most of those friends stay online and don't meet up. It's more parasocial relationships than real ones here. Same thing with romantic relationships, dating is dead here as well.

1. For something that I read was built like a tank, I was a little surprised that the lid to the water tank and over the filter holder seemed like kind of a flimsy plastic.  Other wise.  No issues.
2. Love the glass lined thermal carafe.  Stays hot for hours. Pours well (no drips). It got a little stained inside when I left coffee in all day.  Cleaning with baking soda worked. (https://www.thekitchn.com/the-best-way-to-remove-old-coffee-stains-from-mugs-carafes-tips-from-the-kitchn-200957)
3. Coffee is great.  But honestly, not that different from the oxo 9-cup I tried out or all that different from the old Cuisinart it replaced.  (Maybe I'm just not the discerning a coffee drinker?)
4. A first some of the grounds were dry after brewing, I adjusted the grind size to smaller (12-14 on an Encore).  See attached picture with kosher salt comparison.
5. I've been using 59g/1L (a bit more than the 55g/1L recommended by Moccamaster).  Although I always find grinds stuck in the Encore (even after rocking it back and forth).  I have to dump the grinds into the filter, put the bin back into the grinds and rock again.  A little more always comes out.

Yesterday, I was in the city and happened to recognize a girl I DM’d about two years ago on Instagram. She was working as a server at a restaurant I walked past. Back then, I had a huge crush on her, and when I asked her out via message, she responded that she wasn’t looking for a relationship at the time but would be open to getting to know me better in a group setting (we had mutual friends on Instagram). At the time, I assumed she was just being polite and making an excuse.

What surprised me is that she hasn’t dated anyone or been in a relationship since. A few months ago, she even sent me a DM with just my name and a string of letters, like she was trying to start a conversation, but she quickly deleted it. I happened to see it before it disappeared, which caught my attention.

When I saw her yesterday, I felt too shy to go inside and talk to her, but I’ve been thinking about going back with the intention of asking her out. My concern is that it might come across as strange or intrusive to approach her at work, and I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, I’ve considered DM’ing her instead, but I feel like meeting her “randomly” and striking up a conversation in person might come across as more sincere and romantic.

I’m not sure what the best approach is. Should I visit her workplace again, or should I DM her? And how should I go about it in either case? For example:
	•	If I visit, should I say something like, “Hey, I happened to see you while passing by and wanted to say hi”?

•  Or just sit down with a friend and strike a casual conversation and see her reaction? If it is positive I could ask her if she wants to grab a coffee and catch up

	•	If I DM her, should I say, “Hey, this might be a bit out of the blue, but would you like to go out with me sometime?”

For context, we’ve never actually met in person, but we know what each other looks like, and I think we share some similar interests. I’d really appreciate any advice, as I don’t want to come across as awkward or make her feel uncomfortable.

CAN you take 150 XL twice a day rather than 300 XL once a day?,"Long story short— I was prescribed 150 mg of XL once a day for a month. I initially took it in the morning while drinking coffee, but I experienced a lot of anxiety, which I hated. After reading more on Reddit, I found that some people felt better taking it before bed, so I switched to that schedule. For a few weeks, I felt great, but then the positive effects faded. 

I spoke with my doctor, who increased my dosage to 300 mg of XL once a day. I took this for about five weeks, but I noticed that my anxiety skyrocketed again, especially after drinking coffee. I discussed this with my doctor and suggested splitting the dose to 150 mg in the morning and 150 mg before bed. However, he informed me that XL cannot be taken twice a day and prescribed me 150 mg of SR twice a day instead.

I tried taking one SR in the morning, but it ruined my day. I felt extremely tired, had pressure in my head, and my body ached until about 12 hours later when I finally felt normal again. I think it was over stimulation. Because of this, I decided not to continue with the SR.

Now, I feel that 300 mg of XL is too much for me, especially concerning my anxiety. I'm considering taking two 150 mg XL doses—one in the morning and one at night—to help alleviate the negative spike I experience about 6–7 hours after taking the 300 XL medication.

We definitely cannot expect a coffee shop style fight sequence from Rajini, so i am wondering what it'd feel like. Here are some of my predictions -

Maybe a lot of gunfights instead of h2h, ala Vikram (Kamal was mostly in there for gunfights, unlike VJna)

Heavy usage of Mocobot. In Vikram for all the few h2h sequences that Kamal had, Mocobot was used to great effect (interval and santhanam fight). Makes Old guys look really towering as imho slow movements pair better with the fast twitches of mocobot

Now other cast members i have no idea regarding their skills (maybe Sathyaraj is treated the same way as Rajini), so you guys can speculate on that ",2,1734193445.0,kollywood,20,0.63,False

“Parenting a deaf child who has ADHD: We’re still learning about the impact of ADHD on deaf children, especially when it comes to late diagnosis of ADHD. This is because symptoms are sometimes mistaken as the “normal” behaviour of a deaf child by some medical professionals.”

- and - 

“Challenges Faced by Individuals with ADHD and Who Are Blind, face a multitude of challenges that can affect various aspects of their lives. One of the primary difficulties is the potential for sensory overload. The combination of ADHD and being blind can lead to heightened sensitivity to auditory stimuli, making it challenging to filter out and focus on specific sounds. This can exacerbate the typical difficulties individuals with ADHD experience in maintaining attention and can lead to increased distractibility and difficulty in concentrating on tasks.”

If you’re having a shitty day, try this trick: be grateful for what you DON’T have and honour the amazing gifts of sensitivity you DO have.

1he6c43,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1he6c43/dak_on_processing_cofermentation/,Dak on Processing (+ Co-Fermentation!),"Louis-Philippe Boucher, Coffee Roaster & Co-Founder at Dak answered a few of my questions on processing and co-fermentation this morning in generous detail. I am not affiliated with Dak.

I had specifically asked about Milky Cake as I know there has been a recent spike in discussion. I may cross-post this to other coffee subs. I have been given permission to share this response.

Without further ado, from Louis-Philippe himself:



*Thanks for your e-mail, I am happy to share more about the processes (I love this subject!)*

*We offer co-fermented coffees (about 10% of our lineup) that do have fruits added during fermentation at origin (we ourselves do not add anything at the roastery). We always clearly state it on the label when it comes to co-fermentation and in the description online about the coffee.*

*At the moment, only the Coco Bongo is co-fermented at origin with a starter culture and coconut in the fermentation tank. All our other coffees that we currently sell are not co-fermented. Once we release new co-fermented coffees, we always announce it and put it on the label and description so whoever does not want to consume these types of coffees, they can skip them and choose the others which make up for the majority of our lineup (washed, natural, honey). If I may add, some experimental processes, producers will use bacteria / pre-ferments and yeast to control the fermentation, this is very common but is not considered as co-ferment (the fermentation process in coffee is a very complex thing and is more thorough than simply washing the coffee and drying it).*

*If the below can help organise the coffees:*

*“Clean Coffee” as they say in the industry, classic profiles that do not have controlled / engineered fermentation:Funky Coffees -* ***that are fermented with yeast / bacteria or pre-ferments (like in sourdough) but NOT co-fermented***\*:Co-Ferment, this is a list of the current coffee that have gone through this type of fermentation or previous ones -\* ***A fruit or spice added during fermentation to give a specific flavour****We are thinking of hosting coffee fermentation educational workshops in 2025 as most of the industry do not understand fully the meaning, what it entitles and many will categorise coffees as either ""black or white"". Reddit is an entertaining channel and might be useful to some extent but can be filled with wrong information too.* 

*In the case of Milky Cake specifically, it is fully controlled fermentation, extremely advanced processes using bio-reactors. It is definitely not for the purist that only consume fully washed classical coffees. However, Diego (the producer) has managed to engineer and control his coffees in a very impressive way and he might be the only one in the industry who managed to do this at scale. Without his knowledge and equipment, we would not be able to have this coffee all year long, tasting very similar from harvest to harvest and do it at scale. In his case, it is purely innovation in coffee.*

*Co-Fermented coffees are extremely tricky, they are more intense in flavour and artificial to some, the reality is that they are VERY difficult to control as what is added is organic matter (fruits, spices) and producers have a very hard time controlling the end result. It is also more prone to mold, phenol and quality control at origin and at arrival in Europe are more complex and take more time to make sure there are no major defects. As an example, we had a strawberry co-fermented coffee at some point (Candy Crush) and the result was different every time we bought it from the producer, causing frustration amongst us the roasters, the producers and also the end consumers. They were expecting the exact same taste and the producer couldn’t manage to replicate the taste even after multiple attempts, many of the attempts also included phenol and now we are not selling it anymore.* 

*I hope this clears it up!* 

*Cheers,*
