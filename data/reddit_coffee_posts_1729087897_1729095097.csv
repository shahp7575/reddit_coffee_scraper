Since exploration is a core factor in Starfield, what are your thoughts on if BGS or some skilled modders added content that allows you to do just that?  You contract perhaps with a new type of explorers guild in search of old historical relics in custom ruins added on Earth or even the Moon.  Maybe pitting you against competing guilds.

I know some of you might be thinking, ""Conzuri who?"" but trust me, these shoes have been a game-changer for me.

I was a bit skeptical at first, I mean, I'd never heard of the brand before, but I decided to take a chance and order a pair of their popular ""SoleMates"" sneakers. I've been wearing them non-stop since they arrived, and I'm not exaggerating when I say they've become my go-to shoes.

**Here's the thing:** these shoes are ridiculously comfortable. Like, I-can-wear-them-all-day-without-feeling-a-tinge-of-discomfort comfortable. The arch support is perfect, the cushioning is top-notch, and the materials are super breathable. I've worn them for everything from hiking to just lounging around the house, and they've performed flawlessly.

But what really impressed me was how well they've held up. I've been wearing them for 3 months now, and they still look and feel like new. No signs of wear, no scuffs, no nothing. I've even spilled coffee on them (oops), and they still look great.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Okay, great, but what about the price?"" Well, let me tell you, these shoes are actually pretty reasonably priced. I think I paid around $80 for mine, which is a steal considering the quality you get.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience with you all in case anyone was on the fence about trying out Conzuri shoes. I'm not getting paid to **promote them** or anything (I wish, haha), I just genuinely love these shoes and think they're worth sharing.

**Has anyone else tried Conzuri shoes? What did you think? Let me know in the comments!**

1g52ydd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1g52ydd/guilt/,Guilt ,"My mother is in mental health inpatient right now but that also means she is without alcohol. She has been guilt tripping me through text about how terrible it all is (even though she‚Äôs just as miserable at her home and literally cannot take care of herself, but hey there‚Äôs wine!) but I don‚Äôt want to call her back because she will be totally miserable since she‚Äôs sober. 
I feel guilty that I don‚Äôt do much to help her (besides cleaning her apartment when I visit, buying her things, trying to get her free services at home that she refuses to accept) and that honestly I just don‚Äôt care if she‚Äôs miserable. She has chosen drinking over her only child for 29 years, went to rehab in spring 2021 but I saw her with a bottle of vodka in her purse in the fall that year. I know she has been drinking since then, plus smoking like a chimney when she has half a lung due to cancer. She refuses to make any changes to her lifestyle and expects things to just magically get better. I‚Äôm happy she‚Äôs somewhere safe where she isn‚Äôt going to get wasted and smash her head on a coffee table (happened more than once). Just venting, hate being an only child because the burden all falls on me, and her sisters are after me regarding her health because they think I‚Äôm responsible.

Under any normal circumstance, I would do it. I genuinely miss him, we had a great connection, he was my best friend. But we became a bit toxic. He lied to me a lot, he may have cheated (he says he never did) but I caught him at sketchy places, caught him in lies, caught sketchy texts with his friend, etc. He did treat me like a princess in other ways, he was always there for me, always apologized after arguments, wanted to communicate and work through things, wanted to even do couples therapy. He did a lot of cute sweet things for me, he was romantic, funny, smart, sweet, caring and had a huge heart. He would always help out my family and his friends no questions asked and never expected anything in return. He had all the good things I wanted in a man. 

We had broken up about 3 times over the 2 years and got back together weeks or months later. I ended things for good almost a year ago when he admitted to having thoughts during one of our prior breakups of crashing a car with both of us in it bc if ‚Äúhe couldn‚Äôt have me no one could.‚Äù Obviously he didn‚Äôt do it, and he said he would never do something like that and he could never hurt me. He would hurt himself instead. Which he has also had 2-3 suicide talks/attempts when we broke up in the past but he was really drunk every time it happened, he never said it sober. He apologized every time and said he wouldn‚Äôt do it but it messed with my head. 

When I ended things for good almost a year ago, he didn‚Äôt take it well and blew up my phone to the point I had to block his number. He‚Äôd then try and reach out in other ways (e transfer, sending coffee to my house, a love letter, different social media apps, texting app with different numbers, etc.) He eventually asked me to block him on everything if I can‚Äôt see us being friends and so I did and haven‚Äôt heard from him in months. He has now reached out again on a different text app number asking if we can catch up over lunch or dinner as he would like to see how I‚Äôm doing and keep me in his life in someway.

I struggled really hard with this breakup because I still loved him despite everything because we did have amazing times together and I do miss him as he was my best friend. Do I meet up with him and maybe become acquaintances or friends? Do I respond to him and politely decline? Do I just continue to ignore? I worry if something happens to him that I will live with the regret that I never got to talk to him again. But I also worry about him blowing up my phone again and his mental health if I do open that door again. ",1,1729094530.0,makemychoice,0,1.0,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1g52ot4,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g52ot4/coffee_101_for_new_exmormons/,Coffee 101 for new ex-Mormons:,"1. Drinking coffee is not mandatory. 

2. Don‚Äôt make the mistake I did and just start doing it without saying a word to your spouse if they‚Äôre still TBM. Tell them you want to do it, and find a way you can both be comfortable with it. 

3. All coffee, even really great coffee, is bitter to the unacclimated palate. If you‚Äôre like me and your only exposure to coffee was via sweet treats that were merely coffee-flavored, then the taste of coffee will probably be disappointing to you at first. Unless you go to Starbucks. (Which I and Wilford Brimley don‚Äôt recommend long-term.)

4. Learning to make your own coffee is a lot more fun. And cheaper.

5. Coffee is made by ‚Äústeeping,‚Äù a lot like teas, but without the bags. ie pouring hot water over ground up coffee beans, letting it sit for a time, and then running the steeped water through a filter of some kind into a cup. This wasn‚Äôt immediately obvious to me. I thought at first the coffee grounds went in the cup with the water and were stirred. I didn‚Äôt know that the grounds didn‚Äôt belong in the cup. üòÜ

6. Fresh grounds from coffee beans are the best way to get a good cup. Which means investing in a grinder. Don‚Äôt get a spice grinder. Get a conical burr grinder with adjustable grind sizes. There aren‚Äôt many great pre-ground options.

7. Black coffee is actually healthy for you. Everything else‚Ä¶ well, moderate yourself. Use the least amount of dairy and creamer you can stand otherwise. 

There‚Äôs plenty of info out there for teaching about different types of coffee, different ways to make it, and etc. I thought it would be handy to add the very basics that nobody talks about because people who make it into adulthood without knowing a thing about it are kind of unusual. üòÜ

For what it‚Äôs worth, I like to make my coffee in an AeroPress-type appliance, I use a hand-cranked conical burr grinder with variable grain sizes (usually espresso grind), I froth and heat my milk with one of those cylindrical frother/steamers that are easy to find on Amazon, I have a small scale that weighs in 0.1 grams increments, and a electric gooseneck water boiler pot with precise temperature control - such a nice appliance to have around the house even for the non-coffee drinkers. I also have a fancy vacuum-insulated mug. Keeps the coffee nice and warm for a long time.

I prefer light roast beans from Papua-New Guinea, and I love adding a touch of caramel macchiato non-dairy creamer to my coffee along with foamed, heated whole milk. 

When I‚Äôm in a hurry, I use pre-ground coffee from Europe. They just know how to do it right in a way that we don‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm not recommending any specific brands/products because I don‚Äôt want to come across as a shill and get banned for it.

Let‚Äôs talk about Training Techniques today!

There is so many different ways to train a plant. This is going to be about LST/HST. 

Grab your penjamin, ‚Äúwater pipe‚Äù, coffee, whatever and enjoy! As always, comment to add anything or ask questions! This is to help me learn as well! No one is too good to learn anything!

So I see this get asked every so often on how to do LST. I provided some of my own pics of my plants and what I‚Äôve done. 

LST
Basic form of LST (Low-Stress Training) is to open up the plant to allow more light in and give lower nodes/branches a chance to get their fair share of light. By just doing ANY AMOUNT of LST, YOU WILL INCREASE YOUR YIELD! Another benefit of LST is to even out your canopy, this can also be said for any form of LST/HST. Even canopy means the plant will feed the tops the same (I can do a subject on this Friday!), which means all your tops will be roughly the same size and shape. 

You can use garden stakes like I have or garden wire/tie as well. Bud Clips are another source, if someone will add pics in comments of that! üòÅ 

Topping
Exactly as it sounds. You are cutting/plucking the top. By doing this, you will slow growth for a day or two vertically, but it helps with letting the lowers catch up some. When you top, you get two tops instead of one. You‚Äôll see later on how this helps with other techniques. With Autos, it can be a tricky game, topping too late may stunt or hurt the plant altogether. Shorter vegging plants you may not want to do this to. 

HST (High-Stress Training)
The only thing I will really cover for this is Super Cropping. Super Cropping is very handy and looked over quite a bit. I‚Äôll add a pic in the comments for this. I‚Äôve done it with success on autos. Let‚Äôs say you just want your plant to grow naturally, but it is getting too tall. You will want to pinch the stem to soften it up a little bit and then once you feel the stem is flexible enough, you can bend the stem very gently watching for tears. Once it‚Äôs leaned over, you can use a wire tie or a garden stake, or your preferred way to keep it leaning over. Kind of hand in hand with trellis nets I would say. 

SCROG/Trellis Net
I personally don‚Äôt have any experience with this, but anyone can chime in! The point here is to once again, open up your canopy and spread it wide. You‚Äôd ideally set your net up so the plant will grow into it. From there you will intertwine your branches in the netting to open up each bud site and allow for even vertical growth. Bonus with using a trellis is that if your buds start getting too heavy, the net will help keep them more upright. 

Main-Line/Manifold
I personally love this technique as it appeases my brain. In the pictures you will see P.P.D. This is how I will be doing Autoflower main-lining. Everyone has their own way of doing it. The plant got slightly eaten by my dog, so you will see three mains instead of four. Some people start with only two mains. Personal preference. I do 4 main branches. Pick the two closest nodes to each other and cut the rest. The goal here is to keep even growth and multiply your tops. Topping is a good friend here. If you start with 4 and top once, you have 8 tops. Top it again, you are at 16 tops. And you can keep going from there. Uniform growth and even canopy is the goal here. 

There is a lot more, but this is a start! I know some of it may be me babbling, but it is what it is ü§£ sorry this is so long and thanks if you make it through this!

1g52lup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1g52lup/super_sent_me_flowers/,Super sent me flowers‚Ä¶.,"I moved into a new apartment over the summer and have interacted with the super a few times. He‚Äôs nice enough, doesn‚Äôt show up on time but does try to address concerns as they come up. I hadn‚Äôt talked to him in at least a month when he called me at 8:30 pm Monday night to come over to check my heaters because the previous tenant had issues with them. I didn‚Äôt think they were on but I told him I was cleaning and he couldn‚Äôt come over because it was a mess, tomorrow would be better. 

He didn‚Äôt come the following day and didn‚Äôt let me know even though I told him when I‚Äôd be home from work. I told him the heaters were in fact on though and he could come by when I was home to check on things if he wanted to. 

He called me early this morning and came over with coffee for me. There wasn‚Äôt anything for him to do since my heaters were in fact on, he said he‚Äôd make some adjustments though and also checked out another issue I‚Äôve been having. 

A little while later my doorbell rang and it was a big bouquet of 13 roses, lilies, baby‚Äôs breath. With a note that said ‚Äújust wanted to tell you how beautiful you are‚Äù unsigned. So I texted him and he said he hoped I liked them. I texted back that I have a bf and he said he didn‚Äôt send them that way just that he knows I like plants and that he respects me. Roses aren‚Äôt friendly flowers IMO so I kind of bugged and called my management company, they texted to him and he called me to apologize. He said again that he didn‚Äôt mean anything more than a friendly gesture. He has a fianc√©e etc. I sent screenshots and photos to the management company because while I‚Äôd like to give him the benefit of the doubt, I‚Äôm unsettled by the whole thing. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs sending flowers to my neighbors ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Mind you this whole interaction is happening in my second language so I‚Äôm a little out of my depth to begin with. I do think we‚Äôre in the same age bracket. Idk I just didn‚Äôt feel good about it. He‚Äôs nice but I‚Äôm sincerely not interested and now I‚Äôm uneasy. I‚Äôm a female living alone, you know? 

Has anyone else had that kind of thing happen before? I don‚Äôt think I really overreacted but now I have to continue to deal with him if I have problems in my apartment.

Just looking for some advice or reassurance I guess ‚Ä¶. TIA

1g52jb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/1g52jb7/1year_progress_update_ci8_after_4400_hours_of/,"1-year progress update. CI-8 after 4,400 hours of inflation ","**I know many of you will ask questions in comments or DM me, but please read the entire post first. I've tried to provide as much detail as possible to anticipate what you might ask.** 

It's hard for me to believe I re-started my restoration journey after a very long break (15+ years) in mid-September 2023 just after I stumbled upon an article on circumcision in the news and subsequently found this subreddit. As with many mutilated guys, I was having performance issues with sex (numbness, losing erections and difficulty climaxing). Something had to change! Reading posts about restoration positively affecting these issues definitely caught my attention and gave me hope which spurred me to action. 



When I saw the variety of devices and techniques used by the community, I was overwhelmed and a bit shocked by the sight of various devices and weights hanging off of so many penises! 



Yesterday marked my 1-year anniversary of inflation. I estimated a CI of 2.5 to 3 last September and now, have CI-8 coverage at my normal flaccid size. I've logged a total of 4,400 hours (using the A-tracker app) 98% of which was with the CAR-1 inflation device. To add to those hours, I'd estimate another 600 hrs of manual method 3. I did some other MM but never much liked stretching above or below my scar line. 



My first device which I received 2 week prior to the CAR-1 is a Mantor DS. While I think it's a great device and had high hopes for it, my ventral skin was always slipping out and it was more hassle than I could tolerate (I know many of you love it, but it just didn't work for me).



When I started out and saw posts from guys who'd logged thousands of hours and had been restoring for years, I honestly didn't know how long I would stay committed and how consistent I would be. I'd seen the rule of thumb about setting expectations to gaining one CI level per year or \~1 mm per month. 



It was sometime around the end of the year (2023) when I realized I was making noticeable gains both when looking in the mirror and with hard glide. Then, in March and April it was more obvious (CI-5). Sometime during the summer, it was more like (CI-6 to 7) and by early September I started seeing flaccid overhand with increasing coverage at larger flaccid size (I've measured about 3/4"" variance in flaccid size fluctuations). 



**Routine**:

- 12 hrs per day average

- Zero days off (never thought this would've been possible)

- Manual methods on pee breaks (2-10 mins) and in bed (\~20-30 mins morning and evening)

- Retaining: I started using Chris's silicon retainer at the end of November 2023 which was tight at first then within about 4-5 months, I noticed slack skin with nocturnals. I continued using it every night until mid-August, then quit sleeping with it by mid-September)

I usually wear the CAR on long walks, hikes and trail runs and it stays put without issue.

**Diet**: 

- No seed oils (PUFAs)

- Near zero processed foods

- Plenty of dairy

- Meat

- Coconut oil (to boost metabolism) both by the spoonful and in coffee and rice

- Fruit and juices

- 2-4 coffees per day

- Powered gelatin

- Most every (99%) of meals are home-cooked

**Other**:

- Lots of full body sunshine during the warm months

- 7-8.5 hrs of sleep

- Regular sauna session

- Supplements: Creatine, Taurine, Glycine, Magnesium, Niacin

- Rx: low-dose Tadafinil (Cialis)) 3-5mg, 2-3X per week. I get mine from Amazon Pharmacy



Many thanks to the community and support I've received both in comments and DMs. It's been quite a rewarding journey. While I've not had serious ramps in sensitivity yet, the mechanics of sex have changed dramatically and my wife says it feels totally different. Win win! 

I plan to add red light therapy to the mix soon and will likely take a week off around Christmastime, then target 10 hours of inflation per day in the new year. My next coverage goal is full flaccid tapering and the pucker I have at normal flaccid length. From there, who know!  

I hope you found this update encouraging. I just wish I had some secret to share with you all to mimic my gains. My results could be related to genetics, diet, supplements or lifestyle or some combination ‚Äì who knows! I know many of you are growing at normal rates (\~1 mm per month, 1 CI per year), so please don't discouraged. Just keep tugging consistently and you will certainly induce mitosis and see new skin folds develop.   

**I will be cross-posting this with photos to the sister sub later today or tomorrow.**

We have done longer trips before and know some of the things we really appreciate about the hotels we are staying at.   We travel light, 1 rolling hardshell carry on size each and a smaller ""go bag"" (backpack or small under seat type duffle/roller)

While researching for Japan, I am overwhelmed by the sheer volume of accommodations.  I think I have narrowed down that I would like to do a Luxury Ryokan a couple of times but beyond that, want to stay in hotels with Western beds.  I have knocked off Airbnbs, basic Ryokans, Minshuku, hostels (been there, done that), capsule hotels, etc.  

Based on your experience and my wish list, which **3 brands** should I focus on looking at that would reliably have what I am looking for?  The number of options is completely overwhemling...

**Budget:**  UP TO $250/night.  This is a special trip so happy to pay more for something reliably better.  I am not looking for the cheapest/best value chain or just a crash pad.

**Wish List:**

1. Western style bed, at least Queen sized
2. Quality mattresses (my husband has back issues so prefers firm mattresses which I don't think will be an issue finding in Japan)
3. At least large enough there is somewhere else to sit in the room, a chair and table or sofa (somewhere to get ready, put on make up, write something, etc)
4. Some type of SURFACE, ie a side table, console table, dining table etc...ie somewhere to just put STUFF that isn't the bed or the bathroom.  I can't really do just a room with a bed in it anymore...
5. Accessible outlets, near the bed preferred (charging phones, computers, kindle etc)
6. Onsite Onsen/Sento (indoor and outdoor would be nice).  We love a good SOAK
7. Lobbies or other lounges or relaxation areas...sometimes you want to rest and relax but don't want to lay in bed.  A nice sofa or club chair on the property to read to have a drink is very nice
8. Saunas or steam rooms would be a bonus after long touring days.
9. SOME TYPE of breakfast, even if it's very basic.  Western options appreciated.  We don't love needing to get ready and get out the door before we have a little bite of something and a cup of coffee.
10. Reliably in central/good locations.  
11. On the high end of the budget, rooms with memorable views
12. I don't speak Japanese so brands that often have someone who speaks a bit of English.

  
**Fine to compromise on:**

1. Bathroom can be compact, I don't need a separate toilet room
2. In room laundry isn't required.  We'd like to do laundry once or twice so if there is onsite laundry reliably with a brand, we can make that work.

My problem is that the coffee shot is always a bit sour.

My inner burr setting is 2. My does size is 17g but I have experimented with 18g as well.

I get a decent flow rate only with a grind size of 5 (17 in 34 out in 32 seconds). If I put it to 4, it takes a long time :50 seconds for 34 g. Meanwhile 6 is too fast, 34 out in 18 seconds. So I have locked in 5 as the grind size.

I mailed the roaster and they told me to aim for a shot time of 25 seconds. Not only I am not able to go for that due to the massive variation in the flow rate with the grind sizes, shouldn't aiming for a lower time mean I need to increase the speed and hence reduce extraction?

The other thing they suggested was to increase the yield. I tried going as much as 1:3.5. The sourness decreased, but didn't go away.

Some additional pointers:

* My shot temperature is at max. No more room there for decreasing sourness.
* I am using WDT. I don't have a bottemless portafilter, but the coffee seems to be coming out pretty evenly on both ends.
* The breville handbook says that If I am under extracting, the infusion time will be less than 7 seconds. My first drop comes out at 11 seconds consistently.",1,1729093565.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

My plan last night was to just ignore anything spiritual cause I was getting too distracted by it. Mightve worked on some level.

Issue is that prior I was getting kinda distracted by it all and i'm glad it stopped, at least for the time being, anyone else stop stuff like that and just keep it stopped? I kept feeling that I was having attemtped contact mentally from spiritual beings and it just was happening alot, more than usual, and for a really long period of time and perhaps the coffee helped.

Issue also is that i've been doing heck knows what instead of studying, partially due to distractions and thinking about that near constantly. Maybe also just adhd issues on top of that.

Now that it stopped thats, fine? I had a massive stop in anxiety and paranoia maybe a week or two back which was great honestly, honestly this stopping is great distraction wise cause like hey comeone I need to study and i can;t keep myself focused.

Sorry if this is kinda messy, in a hurry to get somewhere.



edit also my self image last night just changed for la few minutes.

I've been professionally tattooing for 2 years now, I pay my bills that way. But having sold my canvas paintings somehow feels different. 
I had 16 different pieces hanging up in the coffee shop of my hometown for a month, and I just collected the unsold paintings and my check yesterday. It was 3 paintings and 1 print of a pencil drawing that sold. 

One of the paintings that sold was one that I wasn't sure about at all, although I realize I am my biggest critic. It was a 30x36 canvas with an abstract background that I was really going crazy with- it had drippings, splatter, finger smears, and then there was a huge orange octopus in the middle of it all. I wasn't sure about it, but my husband and my friends husband both said it was their favorite out of all of my artwork. The painting that I wasn't sure about had 2 people seriously interested and ready to buy, even with a $140 price tag

The other 2 paintings were smaller. One was of a realistic large mouth bass,  one was of a pair of morel mushrooms.  The pencil drawing print that sold was actually a really cool drawing, it was hyper realistic- a deer skull on one side, a whitetail deer face on the other side. The deer drawing and mushroom painting both sold to the same person.

I am still riding on this high.

Am I wrong?,"Last night I was playing my PS5 and my partner was talking to his friend on FaceTime next to me on the couch. No headphones. Sometimes I respond to things not meant for me. Not because I am listening to the conversation w/ the express purpose of responding. It just happens with whatever I hear. I don't have time to think about it, it just comes out. Mostly under my breath. I assume my mind's thinking it & my mouth speaks it before I can even process that it's coming.

Well, I responded to something his friend said, & he took his hand off screen & shut it closed sharply & forcefully as if to say ""Be quiet,"" like I was a kid. We don't do that. I don't do that to him. I instantly reacted. I turned to him & just looked. I finished what I was doing, shut off the PS5, showered & shaved my head. (Shaving my head always makes me feel better, but it didn't.) After my shower, I went to bed. Still mad.

I didn't say anything in the moment because I wanted to make sure my feelings were warranted. I only offer grace because he doesn't know that's what was happening, but he knows I have ADHD. To me, it would be no point in me exploding. I have a hard time with emotions, so I thought I could also be overreacting.

Fast forward to today, I think he knows he did something wrong. I woke up mad. Laid in bed 30 extra minutes because I knew he was up & I didn't want to talk to him. He's off work, so he's home. I didn't make an effort to say good morning or be as jovial as I usually am. I got dressed, took my medicine, said bye, & left for work. No kiss, I just left. I work from home, but I went to the office today. Office wasn't open, so I'm at a coffee shop. Still pissed. We've been together 11 years. At a point you know how it goes, so I chose not to engage. I'm not leaving, but it bugged the hell outta me. I feel if I bring it up, he's going to say I'm reading too deep into my ADHD, but that's what it was.

# Come utilizzare SearchGPT dall‚ÄôItalia

Uno dei limiti attuali di¬†SearchGPT¬†√® la sua disponibilit√† geografica. Al momento, √® accessibile solo negli Stati Uniti e in pochi altri paesi. Tuttavia, gli utenti italiani interessati a provare il nuovo motore di ricerca possono aggirare questo ostacolo utilizzando una VPN. Utilizzando una connessione VPN, √® possibile simulare la propria posizione negli Stati Uniti e accedere alla piattaforma attraverso¬†chat.openai.com.  
  
Un esempio di VPN gratuita e facile da usare √®¬†[TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/), che permette di connettersi rapidamente a server americani e provare SearchGPT. Una volta configurata la VPN, sar√† possibile esplorare la nuova interfaccia del motore di ricerca e verificarne il funzionamento in prima persona. Nonostante sia una soluzione temporanea, questa rappresenta una valida alternativa per chi non vuole aspettare il lancio ufficiale in Italia.

Quando si accede a¬†SearchGPT, si nota immediatamente un‚Äôicona a forma di mappamondo che indica la possibilit√† di cercare sul web. Una delle funzioni interessanti √® la sezione dedicata agli¬†argomenti di tendenza, che sembra concentrarsi principalmente su eventi e notizie provenienti dagli Stati Uniti. Questa funzione √® utile per rimanere aggiornati su ci√≤ che sta accadendo nel mondo, soprattutto se si √® interessati a tematiche globali.  
  
I risultati offerti da SearchGPT su questi argomenti di tendenza includono non solo testi e link, ma anche video da YouTube e brevi descrizioni che possono arricchire l'esperienza di navigazione. Questa capacit√† di combinare diverse tipologie di contenuti in un unico risultato √® una delle innovazioni principali che distingue SearchGPT dai motori di ricerca tradizionali.

# Test query su notizie recenti

Uno dei principali vantaggi di¬†SearchGPT¬†√® la sua capacit√† di fornire informazioni aggiornate sugli eventi recenti. Grazie alla sua connessione con il web, il motore √® in grado di cercare e fornire notizie in tempo reale, come quelle relative alla politica italiana o a eventi globali. Tuttavia, va segnalato che non sempre le informazioni fornite sono dell‚Äôultimo minuto.  
  
Ad esempio, in una query riguardante il¬†premio Nobel per la letteratura, SearchGPT √® riuscito a fornire informazioni accurate sull‚Äôassegnazione del premio ad Ann Kang, ma i dettagli non erano aggiornati al momento esatto della ricerca. Questo pu√≤ essere considerato uno dei limiti attuali del motore, ma √® probabile che con futuri aggiornamenti OpenAI possa migliorare la velocit√† e la precisione nel fornire notizie in tempo reale.

# Test query sul meteo

Un‚Äôaltra funzione degna di nota √® il¬†widget meteo¬†integrato in SearchGPT. Quando si effettuano query riguardanti le previsioni del tempo, il motore fornisce risultati dettagliati e facilmente comprensibili. Oltre alle informazioni base come temperatura e condizioni atmosferiche, il widget offre anche dettagli aggiuntivi come la qualit√† dell‚Äôaria e suggerimenti pratici su cosa indossare in base alle previsioni.  
  
Per esempio, cercando le previsioni per la citt√† di Lauria, SearchGPT ha consigliato di indossare una giacca leggera per le ore serali, in base alle temperature previste. Questa personalizzazione delle informazioni √® un grande passo avanti rispetto ai classici motori di ricerca, offrendo un servizio pi√π interattivo e utile nella vita quotidiana degli utenti.

# Test query sulla finanza

SearchGPT¬†si distingue anche per le sue capacit√† in ambito finanziario. Utilizzando query relative al mercato azionario, √® possibile visualizzare un¬†widget finanziario¬†che offre grafici interattivi sull‚Äôandamento delle azioni, con la possibilit√† di analizzare i movimenti di mercato nel tempo. Questo √® particolarmente utile per chi segue da vicino l‚Äôandamento delle borse o √® interessato a investimenti.  
  
Un esempio pratico √® la query relativa alle azioni Tesla: il motore ha fornito un grafico interattivo dell‚Äôandamento del titolo, accompagnato da un riassunto delle notizie finanziarie pi√π rilevanti. Inoltre, SearchGPT ha spiegato le ragioni dietro il recente calo delle azioni, rendendo pi√π comprensibile l'andamento del mercato a chi non ha una formazione economica specifica. Come utilizzare SearchGPT dall‚ÄôItalia

# Test query su un personaggio

Quando si tratta di cercare informazioni su¬†personaggi famosi, i risultati forniti da SearchGPT possono essere un po' limitati. In un test condotto su Vincenzo Cosenza, ad esempio, i risultati erano per lo pi√π autoreferenziali, provenienti dal suo sito web e canale YouTube, senza fornire approfondimenti aggiuntivi.  
  
Anche con personaggi pi√π noti, come il regista David Lynch, i risultati erano in gran parte presi da fonti ufficiali come il suo sito web e Wikipedia. Sebbene queste informazioni siano utili, non sempre rappresentano il meglio che il web ha da offrire su un determinato personaggio. Questo rappresenta un‚Äôarea in cui¬†SearchGPT¬†ha ancora margine di miglioramento.

# Test query sulla cucina

Le query relative alla cucina offrono un mix interessante di risultati. Spesso,¬†SearchGPT¬†attinge dalla sua vasta base di conoscenza interna, ma per ottenere informazioni direttamente dal web √® necessario essere molto espliciti nella richiesta. Questo a volte porta a risultati che non sono completamente integrati o ben strutturati.  
  
Ad esempio, cercando una ricetta per il riso basmati, il motore ha restituito una combinazione di suggerimenti da vari siti web e video di YouTube, non sempre pertinenti o in lingua italiana. Questo dimostra che, sebbene SearchGPT possa essere utile per ricette e informazioni culinarie, non ha ancora raggiunto la fluidit√† di un motore di ricerca pi√π specializzato in questo ambito.

# Test query local

Per quanto riguarda le ricerche locali,¬†SearchGPT¬†si comporta abbastanza bene. √à in grado di fornire liste di attivit√† commerciali, come coffee shop o ristoranti in una determinata citt√†, anche se al momento manca l‚Äôintegrazione di una mappa che visualizzi le loro posizioni.  
  
Ad esempio, cercando coffee shop specializzati in¬†specialty coffee¬†a Milano, SearchGPT ha restituito una lista accurata di locali, ma senza fornire una mappa per facilitarne la localizzazione. Questo potrebbe essere un punto da migliorare per future versioni, magari con l‚Äôintegrazione di servizi di mappatura pi√π avanzati.

# Test query shopping

Quando si tratta di¬†shopping, SearchGPT offre una buona esperienza di ricerca, fornendo liste di prodotti ben dettagliate. Ad esempio, cercando i migliori smartphone di fascia alta, il motore ha restituito una lista completa con caratteristiche tecniche e una tabella comparativa dei vari modelli.  
  
Tuttavia, l‚Äôesperienza di shopping su SearchGPT non √® ancora al livello di Google Shopping o di altri motori di ricerca specializzati. Manca un‚Äôulteriore personalizzazione dei risultati in base alle preferenze dell‚Äôutente o a filtri avanzati, che possono rendere l‚Äôesperienza di acquisto pi√π mirata e soddisfacente.

# Query shopping: confronto con Google AI Overview

Il confronto con Google √® inevitabile.¬†Google AI Overview, la piattaforma di ricerca avanzata di Google potenziata dall‚ÄôAI Gemini, offre un‚Äôesperienza di shopping pi√π ricca e completa rispetto a SearchGPT. I risultati di Google sono spesso accompagnati da riassunti generati dall‚Äôintelligenza artificiale, selezioni di prodotti e link per approfondimenti, creando una ricerca pi√π dettagliata e visiva.  
  
SearchGPT, pur avendo un grande potenziale, non raggiunge ancora il livello di personalizzazione e profondit√† offerto da Google. Tuttavia, con futuri aggiornamenti, OpenAI potrebbe chiudere questo gap e offrire un‚Äôesperienza di shopping pi√π competitiva

# Test query di pianificazione e confronto con Google AI Overview

Per la¬†pianificazione di viaggi¬†e attivit√†, Google AI Overview sembra ancora essere il leader indiscusso. L‚ÄôAI di Google fornisce un itinerario completo, con immagini, link a luoghi di interesse, suggerimenti su dove pernottare e una mappa interattiva che rende la pianificazione del viaggio un‚Äôesperienza piacevole e fluida.  
  
SearchGPT, d‚Äôaltra parte, offre informazioni meno strutturate e pi√π basiche. Sebbene sia in grado di fornire consigli su mete turistiche e ristoranti, non offre la stessa ricchezza di contenuti visivi e interattivi di Google. Anche in questo caso, OpenAI dovr√† lavorare su un maggiore sviluppo per poter competere.

# Conclusioni e opinione su SearchGPT

SearchGPT¬†√® sicuramente un passo importante verso l‚Äôintegrazione dell‚Äôintelligenza artificiale nei motori di ricerca, ma la strada per competere con giganti come Google √® ancora lunga. Sebbene offra widget utili per meteo e finanza e un‚Äôinterfaccia conversazionale, le sue limitazioni attuali nel fornire informazioni approfondite su personaggi, ricette o shopping, lo rendono ancora un passo indietro rispetto ai concorrenti.  
  
La competizione tra¬†Google e OpenAI¬†sar√† sicuramente affascinante da seguire nei prossimi anni, soprattutto man mano che SearchGPT continuer√† a evolversi. Sar√† interessante vedere come OpenAI risponder√† alle sfide poste da Google AI Overview e come la SEO dovr√† adattarsi a queste nuove tecnologie.

Full disclosure: I am as my profile will indicate openly a Toast AE- I am located on the east coast, 1,000‚Äôs of miles from any incentive to sell anyone anything. 

That said, I have interesting hobbies, and I‚Äôve recently returned back from California fascinated by how different the operations are, and the expectations of the consumers particularly as it relates to the usage and execution of technology. 

I‚Äôm working on a tech stack restaurant analysis to compare the differences between west coast / east coast. 

If there is anyone here, owners or managers or even just OG‚Äôs like myself that have been in the industry for 15+ years ( willing to allow me to interview them for 20 minutes phone or zoom today) I will give you a $20 coffee gift card of your choice, and provide you an OBJECTIVE and detailed technology stack review, credit card processing analysis, and potential ROI calculation. 

Fun fact: consumer research entities regularly reach out to those of use on the front lines of restaurant technology and pay us for these insights because while the information is publicly available, it‚Äôs all changed so quickly, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to interpret and apply.

Anyhow, will provide supporting evidence that I‚Äôm a real person with real expertise in advance, and not looking for any private information that couldn‚Äôt readily be found on Google.

So I have a glucose monitor because I have been having a ton of shakiness between meals and wanted to check my sugars. I haven't done this right yet to see what the changes are since I've only tested when I'm symptomatic, and I know taking tests before, 30 mins, and an hour after meals would give me more info, which I plan to do. 

But for now here is my experience: This morning I got a decaf coffee with a lot of sweetener and sipped it from 7:30 to 8:30 with an otherwise empty stomach. 

At 10:30 I decided to get breakfast but couldn't butter my toast I was shaking so badly. I decided to test my sugars--couldn't hold the lancet still enough and later stabbed myself a second time removing the needle because I was so shaky. 

My levels were 77. Is this low? This is 2-3 hours after drinking a very sugary drink with nothing else on my stomach. 

Does this sound like I'm coming down too low?

In the future, what would be defined as too big a drop? Like say I go from xx high number to yy low in two hours---what amount of change would be too much?

A friend of mine wants me to get fasting insulin tested--my A1C and fasting glucose have been fine but she thinks I may be overproducing insulin as part of early insulin resistance... could that cause my shakiness?

Any tips would be helpful. Google has little info on non-diabetic blood sugars. I am trying to figure out what is going on and will try some lifestyle changes to see if I can fix whatever may be happening.

In the last 3 weeks I've noticed some discharge that varied between clear and watery to cheesy white. I had a bit more frequent urge to urinate but nothing too crazy. Also some mild kind of pressure feeling on the lower abdomen. Those were the only symptoms.

I assumed it's an UTI or a vaginal infection and I'm at my home country right now where I don't have an insurance and was waiting to go back to where I currently live in another country to do tests. 

However, last night I noticed enhanced cramping and pain in lower abdomen. I decided to go and to urine analysis this morning and fell asleep. 

This morning I woke up with intense cramping and went to bathroom where a chunk of coffee -colord fluid fell out of me. I panicked, put my shoes on and went to the ER. 

They sent me to a gynecologist and, long story short the gyno said that everything is fine but my endometrium is thickened (12mm) and that it's in the state of being in the middle of a period. Other than that, everything is perfect. 

Now, in the last few months (almost a year actually) there have been shortages of testosterone in my country and I had irregular shots. Sometimes I was late for 2 weeks, sometimes for a couple of days, all depending on my ability to find testosterone (sometimes I had to travel to the other end of the country just to find one available ampoule. 

Things are back to normal in the last 6 weeks and my last 3 shots were on time. However, could previous months still leave a mess in my body even if the last three shots were on time?

I am not sure how, but it did. I think I really came to terms with it when I did psilocybin mushrooms a few years ago. My third eye was opened. I had a deeply spiritual experience.  After spending this morning over on r/egg_irl , most of the memes applied to me. 

I constantly thinking of being a woman. Shaving my entire body, getting manicures and pedicures is very euphoric. All of my book characters, my main characters, are female. I look back on my life, and every time I look back, I am replaced by a petite slender redhead female.

I picture myself looking like Elle Alexandra. (Under 18 do NOT look her up please! My avatar is Elle.)

I have been married for a long time. My wife and I have discussed this at length. She is a masculine female, and I am a feminine male. Both of us represent as cis. 

In any case, I am not doing HRT, FFS, GRS, BA, Butt Lift, or any surgeries. I am keeping my AMAB body. I believe in a former life, or future life, I was or will be female again. I do believe (including belief in the multi-worlds theory) that we have multiple lives as is taught in Buddhism. 

I have dreams of waking up female! Maybe this male body and male life itself is a dream I am having in another world, or another mirror in the universe.

I don't really know from a theological, spiritual, metaphysical, or cosmological viewpoint what I am. I do know this late in life M61, I have been in the wrong body my whole life, and my wife does believe people can be born in the wrong body.

My obsession with Elle Alexandra, and I have spoken with her twice on Reddit, is not based on her being a lesbian performer, but based on the fact that I see myself in her. I am a lesbian.

Recently, I was in New York. Brooklyn. I saw some wone in a coffee shop, and immediately I wish I was them. I am six foot and large. I have been a weightlifter for decades, but when I see Elle, or another woman like Emma Stone, I want to be them. I want to be a woman, and when I think of myself as a woman, I am gleeful happy.

The  listing:

>WATER TANK \*NO LID\* For Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Breville BNV125TTN OEM Part

We don't have the Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe -- just the Pop+ -- but it works.  The lid from our original water tank fits on the new one, and there's no leaks, after about a week of use.

Size comparison of the new and old:

I (25F) have a friend, she started where I work 2 years ago and we soon became friends, the job wasn't for her and she left after a few months. My parents also know her due to other circumstances.

The thing that annoys me is she's horrendously unreliable. For example, weekend just gone we were going to meet at our towns coffee shop for a catch up Saturday morning. She cancels on me as she had a medical appointment come up (that I understand) so we rearranged to do it Sunday morning instead. Turns out her daughter was staying Saturday night and Sunday but she didn't tell me straight away. My parents saw her Friday evening and she told them about her daughter.  My mum told me Saturday morning when I saw her but my friend didn't tell me until Saturday afternoon. 

I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but this is far from the first time. She's let me down and canceled more times than she hasn't and it really winds me up. I work mon-fri and only have weekends free and if plans are made I then plan the rest of my weekend around my plans with her which then get messed up when she wants to cancel or change planes it's incredibly annoying.

She calls me her 'best friend' and 'adopted sister' but it really doesn't feel like it. Me and my husband have recently had family issues with his step dad passing and she keeps saying how she's there for me if I need anything but she can't seem to spare a little time at weekends for a chat never mind if I actually needed something.

Now I've unfriended her on Facebook and blocked her on messenger as I've had enough and don't want anything to do with her, I've just had enough of her. However I don't think she's noticed and our birthdays are coming up (mines the 5th hers is the 6th of the month) last year we got gifts for each other went out for the day at the weekend etc and this year I really don't want to I don't want her in my life

I don't want to effectively lead her on thinking we're still friends but I don't know what to say to her that isn't completely cruel to get rid of her from my life especially as saying the wrong thing could then make my relationship tense with my parents and make their life more difficult.

I really don't know what to do. 

WIBTA if I cut her out of my life when she doesn't think she's done anything wrong?

For the past 3 months, I've been ruminating about everything I've done wrong in the relationship, and it won't stop. This is affecting our relationship, and I'm afraid I might push him to break up if I don't find a way to stop. I keep thinking back to when we first met in college. We lived in the same building and that's how we met. When we met for the first time, I had so much fun, but I wasn't entirely sure. At that time, I had no experience with guys at all, only chatting online. We hung out twice, and then I went back home. During those two weeks, I started chatting online with another guy, and I really liked him because he was direct, while my current boyfriend wasn‚Äôt showing any direct signs. And during those two weeks, he didn‚Äôt text me very often. When I returned to the city where I studied, I went for coffee with this other guy, and I didn‚Äôt like him. The very next day, I started liking my current boyfriend. I keep blaming myself for not knowing right away and for even talking to someone else.

The next thing I think about is that I couldn‚Äôt open up to him about private things, and that blocked me from committing to the relationship earlier. I have alopecia and wear a wig, and I didn‚Äôt want to commit to the relationship because I felt like I was withholding something important if he didn‚Äôt know.

There are some private things I didn‚Äôt tell him until now. I felt ashamed of the fact that I live with my family in a very small apartment, share a room with my brother, and my parents sleep in the living room. Everything is pretty old. I never talked about the issues at home with my brother, who hasn‚Äôt worked in a long time. Now I realize that none of those things are abnormal or something to be ashamed of. I feel like it really affected our relationship that I couldn‚Äôt open up about it.

The last thing I regret is related to sex. But that‚Äôs actually about my need for control. It was always important to me what date we had our first kiss, the date we officially started dating, and I wanted the first time we had sex to be with rose petals, candles... I regret wanting to control all of that. So it ended up happening six months after the official start of our relationship, although we had done other things in the meantime. I feel like I made that whole beginning more difficult. I hadn‚Äôt resolved everything within myself before meeting him, and I wasn‚Äôt mature enough for a relationship, and I regret not being able to give him everything.

We stand in silence as I input the orders until I notice one doesn't define the size. Without thinking in my delusional state, I ask ""I'm sorry what size was this one"" pointing to the sticky note. He then casually answers ""oh grande"" and my jaw DROPPED. We stood there for a good like 78 seconds in complete silence beforehand. I immediately profusely apologized telling him I thought he was deaf to which he wasn't offended and laughed it off, but I felt terminally stupid because 1. When I was under the presumption of him being deaf, I said something thinking he would hear it and 2.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Dr. Theresa Chambers, Acting Director of Collections, AMNH**

**Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: October 12th, 2136**

I sat in the jump seat of a small cargo vessel known as the *Borealis*. The *Borealis* was an old venlil made cargo hauler that was currently being operated by an American shipping company. It was showing its age, with clear signs of wear and tear on many of the fixtures and detailing. Included in this wear and tear was the jump seat that I was sitting on. It had a cushion, or really what was left of one. Much of the fabric and upholstery had rotted and worn away with age, but honestly, I didn‚Äôt care. Sure it was uncomfortable, but I was hopefully going to avoid the extermination fleet.

I sat alone, as the only free space for me was in the cargo hold. It was clear that this vessel was extremely utilitarian, with space for the crew and nothing else. Thus, as a passenger, I was really treated as an afterthought. Still, I was glad that I at least had a seat, even if it wasn‚Äôt a very comfortable one. I shifted a bit on the seat, trying to get comfortable. Sadly, it‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs errand. No matter how I sit on the seat, I simply can‚Äôt get comfortable. With a sigh, I lean over to my duffle bag and open it. Fishing through it, I pulled out my tablet and began to read through the plan for what I was to do when I landed.¬†

One thing worried me about the plans for my arrival. I had done some research during the scant few moments of free time I had on the exterminators and now was dreading meeting them. Online, there already were a few horror stories circulating about them. Stories about how they treat humans, how antagonistic they were to us and I was dreading experiencing this first hand. Still, I was only the first of many humans arriving in Grovelake, so I suppose I should probably represent humanity the best I can to them.¬†

I looked over the contact information I was given, trying to memorize the names of the exterminators that would be greeting me. If I was to leave a good impression with them, knowing their names would be a good start. I repeated the names over and over quietly to myself for a bit. Once I felt that I had a good grasp on how to pronounce the names, I decided to also memorize the names of the other Venlil I was given contact info for. I found that they were all pretty straight forward to pronounce, and all were fairly short. I just hoped that I memorized the correct pronunciation.

Once this was done, I looked at the time on my tablet and saw that only around an hour had passed. I still had plenty of time left to kill. Maybe I should try to familiarize myself with the area a bit. Couldn‚Äôt hurt to learn about the town I‚Äôd be living in for the foreseeable future. Thankfully, I had managed to find a small guide about the town published by the local government. Opening it, I started to read.

As soon as I laid eyes on the town I knew I‚Äôd like it there. The few pictures of it were gorgeous looking. The town was situated on the shores of the peaceful looking Grove Lake, a lake that looked perfect for swimming in. Flowing from this lake was the equally tranquil looking Grove River. It too looked like a wonderful place to swim in, its waters looking pristine. The town itself was equally lovely looking. Sure the alien architecture was different looking, but it had a unique charm to it. It seemed like any other sleepy small town to me, a far cry from most of the places I‚Äôve lived in. I was actually feeling a little excited to see the town when I landed.¬†

Once I finished reading the guide, I checked the time again and saw that I still had plenty of time left before I was to land. I thought for a moment, before realizing just how tired I was actually feeling. I hadn‚Äôt had a chance to really rest with all the chaos of the evacuation and I was really feeling it now that I had time to myself. I felt my eyes growing heavy and before I knew it, I was out cold.

\[SUBJECT ASLEEP, SKIPPING FORWARD 3 HOURS\]

I was enjoying my rest when I was suddenly awoken to a call over the PA system. It called out, ‚ÄúATTENTION ALL CREW, PREPARING TO ENTER VENLIL PRIME‚ÄôS ATMOSPHERE. PLEASE PREPARE FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY‚Äù This was the first time I was ever entering or reentering an atmosphere and I had no idea what to even expect.

My question was soon answered when the ship began to violently shake and rumble as we entered the atmosphere. An unearthly roar filled the ship as we descended, almost deafening in volume. Then, just as quickly as it began, the shaking and roaring stopped. I had then noticed that I was gripping a bar next to me so hard that my knuckles were white. I released my grip on the bar and looked around. Thankfully, nothing had shifted during entry into the atmosphere.¬†

Leaning over, I quickly pulled out the mask I was to wear when I landed. I looked at it, my reflection visible on its mirrored face. God, I was a mess. Even after sleeping for who knows how long, I still look exhausted. My black hair‚Äôs a mess, and there‚Äôs bags under my eyes. I place the mask on my lap, before fishing through my bag once more to find my brush. If I want to leave a good impression with the exterminators who‚Äôd be greeting me, I probably shouldn‚Äôt look like a mess. I quickly brush my hair, trying to work out some knots in it, hoping to make myself look even remotely presentable.¬†

Once I had gotten myself looking the best I could manage with my limited resources, I began running what I was going to say to the exterminators. I quickly decided that I was going to be courteous and reserved, only speaking when spoken to. That way, they‚Äôd have no reason to go after me. As I ran through the possibilities in my head, I heard another message start over the PA.¬†

‚ÄúATTENTION ALL CREW, PREPARE FOR FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING.‚Äù¬†

Upon hearing this, I put my mask on and make sure all my things are in order. This is it. I‚Äôm about to step foot onto another planet for the first time in my life. Had you told me I was going to be doing this a year ago, I would‚Äôve called you insane. But here I am. I take a few deep breaths, trying to keep myself calm, but it‚Äôs difficult. The gravity of the whole situation is finally hitting me. I was here on an alien world overseeing the entire collection of the museum I worked at. My home was likely not even going to exist in a few days and I have no idea if I‚Äôll ever even get to go back to earth. It hurt knowing this, but at the same time I felt somewhat proud. I was chosen to oversee the whole collection. These feelings mixed, making me feel confused and frustrated more than anything. I could feel tears running down my cheeks under my mask as I continued to take deep breaths. Finally, after a few more moments, I managed to get myself calm enough to feel that I could handle talking with the exterminators. Once I got to my residence, I could let my emotions flow there.

Continuing to take deep breaths, I looked around as I could hear the hum of the engines die down, followed by a sharp jerk as the ship stopped moving forward. I was shaken in my seat and knew that I was to be landing soon. I could feel the ship slowly descend, before stopping for a final time. The engine‚Äôs humming finally stopped and I looked around as I waited to see what‚Äôll happen next.¬†

Soon, I could hear footsteps approaching, and I saw the form of the captain emerging from around a crate. Captain Hern√°ndez called out to me, and asked me ‚ÄúHow are you holding up down here? Sorry about not checking with you earlier, but we were struggling with something on the bridge.‚Äù ‚ÄúI could be better, but it‚Äôs not any fault of your own. This ship clearly isn‚Äôt made for a passenger and I get that. I‚Äôm just glad you got me here in one piece. Thank you‚Äù I replied as I stood up and stretched for the first time in a long while.¬†

‚ÄúStill, I‚Äôm sorry that we didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to have you sit. Hopefully you never have to travel like this again. Anyway, we‚Äôve landed safely and you‚Äôre free to disembark at your earliest convenience.‚Äù Captain Hern√°ndez replied, before departing just as quickly as he showed up.¬†

I took another deep breath, before gathering my things and walking towards the aft exit. The door opened with a swish, before I was blinded by the bright light of the Venlil Prime sun. Not only that, but I began noticing that everything, including myself, felt far heavier than what I was used to. blinking a few times, I slowly made my way out of the ship. Each step I took was shaky and unsteady as I tried to get used to the higher gravity of Venlil Prime. Looking around, I spot a few Venlil looking at me. They‚Äôre clearly a little nervous as they continue to watch me making my way down onto the landing pad. Not seeing a sign for where I‚Äôm supposed to go, I call out to them

‚ÄúUh, hello? I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm scaring you, but where am I supposed to go?‚Äù Once they hear me speak, they visibly tense up, before one of them, a medium height Venlil with black wool speaks up

‚ÄúT-the main passenger terminal is that way‚Ä¶‚Äù They stammered out, before pointing to a large door with their tail. Once they‚Äôd finished pointing, they practically sprinted away from me. I sighed and began walking towards the indicated door.

Once I‚Äôve reached it, I watch as it opens automatically for me, much to my relief. Carrying my two suitcases and duffle bag, I headed into the main passenger terminal. It was deserted, not another person inside. Not another person, save for 3 figures who stood by the entrance on the far side of it. Two of them were clad in silvery suits, with one standing taller over the rest of them. The figure not in a silvery suit had an almost cream colored wool and was carrying a basket filled with something. The tallest of the figures in the silvery suits was the first to spot me, and quickly made their way to me. As they walked towards me, their tail flicked back and forth. What this meant, I had no idea.¬†

Once they got to within a few paces of me, they stopped and spoke. With them standing in front of me, it was clear that they were at least a couple inches taller than me. Their voice translated as feminine and had a professional edge to it. ‚ÄúGood paw! Dr. Theresa Chambers, I assume?‚Äù Good paw? What on earth did that mean? Still I knew I had to be courteous. So, I replied with ‚ÄúUh, good paw to you too? And yes, I am Dr. Chambers. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?‚Äù¬†

The figure before me took a second to reply, before she said ‚ÄúChief Exterminator Veni, Grovelake Exterminator‚Äôs Guild. Next to me is Prestige Exterminator Nira and Magister Chevek. Nira and I will be taking you to where you‚Äôll be staying, and will answer any questions that you‚Äôve got.‚Äù As she introduced each of the other Venlil, she pointed to them with her tail. The next Venlil to speak was the one introduced as Chevek. The title of magister was unfamiliar to me, but based on the messages they had sent me, I suppose it was similar to a mayor.

‚ÄúI h-hope that you had a safe trip, Dr. Chambers. As the magister of Grovelake, let me be the first to welcome you to our h-humble town. While I originally wasn‚Äôt going to be here, I simply couldn‚Äôt resist the c-chance to welcome our first human!‚Äù He told me, before handing the basket he was holding to the exterminator identified as Nira. She takes it and simply holds onto it. He then adds ‚ÄúSeeing as your hands are occupied, I‚Äôll have Nira here hold onto it for the time being. A-anyway, It was a pleasure meeting you, but I‚Äôve got a meeting to get to soon. I-If you need me, you have my contact information.‚Äù He then made a quick exit out of the terminal and out of sight, leaving me left with the two exterminators. A prospect I was not exactly thrilled with. I could practically feel Veni looking me over like I was some sort of threat or something, and a shiver ran down my spine. I wasn‚Äôt sure what her intentions were for me, but it left me a little worried. After a moment of awkward silence, Nira speaks up.

‚ÄúS-so, why don‚Äôt we get you and your luggage loaded into our van?‚Äù There‚Äôs a nervous edge to her voice, almost like she‚Äôs nervous about my presence. The same could not be said about Veni. She exuded confidence as she walked up to me and told me‚ÄúHere, let me help you with those bags. You must be exhausted from your journey.‚Äù Her tail flicked back and forth in what seemed like contentment as she grabbed one of my suitcases. There was a hint of something else in her voice as she spoke to me, something that I simply couldn‚Äôt place. Once she has my suitcase, she starts walking towards the exit, gesturing for me to do something with her tail. I stared at her in confusion for a moment, before I realized that given the context, she probably wants me to follow her.¬†

I followed along behind her as I‚Äôm led outside of the terminal and to an equally silvery van. Nira opened the back, placed the basket inside, before she gestured for me to climb in too. I tossed my duffle bag and suitcase inside, before I climbed into the back of the van. It was sparse inside, to say the least. There were a few seats in the back, seats that thankfully looked far more comfortable than the ones on the ship I had just gotten off of, and what appeared to be a few spots to hang equipment on the sides of the van. Other than that, there was nothing else. Just the bare minimum and that was it.

Once I was seated, I could hear talking outside the van. I couldn‚Äôt make out exact words, but I could tell that it was about who was going to drive the van and who would be watching me. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long to get my answer, as Veni soon climbed into the back, carrying my other suitcase. She placed it with my other suitcase, before she took a seat across from me. As she made herself comfortable, she took off the silvery hood of her uniform. Under it, was a charcoal gray face with a striking splash of white surrounding her right eye. As she sat across from me, she didn‚Äôt show a single sign of fear, instead there was a hint of interest on her face. She stayed silent for a bit, before she spoke up, breaking the awkward silence we had found ourselves in. ‚ÄúSo, Dr. Chambers, how was your trip? And would you mind if I asked you a few questions? Ever since your people made first contact with us, there‚Äôs so much I've been dying to know about your kind. Sapient predators, I mean who would‚Äôve thought such a thing was possible!‚Äù She sounded excited as she spoke with me, much to my confusion. This was a far cry from what I was told to expect from exterminators, much to my relief. Still, her wording was strange. Sapient predators? Really? It didn‚Äôt make much sense to me, but I suppose it fits with the simplistic view that the federation has on predator and prey. With a sigh, I answered her

‚ÄúWell, it could‚Äôve been more comfortable. I was seated on a jump seat in the cargo hold of a tiny old freighter. In fact, I‚Äôm still a little sore from the whole trip. But I‚Äôve been worse. I‚Äôm just glad that I made it here in one piece. As for the questions, I don‚Äôt mind answering a few!‚Äù She flicked her tail back and forth with apparent excitement, although I still wasn‚Äôt sure of the exact meaning of her various tail gestures just yet, and then spoke with clear excitement in her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that you had a rough trip here. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll try my best to ensure that your stay here in Grovelake is both safe and *comfortable*. As for my first question, I simply must know what your job actually is. I tried doing a little research on you before you arrived, but was left extremely confused by the whole thing.‚Äù Her first question wasn't that out of the ordinary, but that first part had an almost flirty edge to it. I simply shrugged and decided to ignore it, instead answering the question she asked me. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm a paleontologist. Simply put, I study long dead organisms and their traces. Specifically, I specialize in studying paravians, which are birds and their ancestors. As for what I did at my museum back in New York, I was responsible for planning and approving additions to my department‚Äôs collection, what exhibits we displayed, outreach programs and educational programs. It was a lot of work, and now I‚Äôm responsible for doing the same thing, only for the whole museum‚Äôs collection. But, I love what I do. I just find this stuff fascinating.‚ÄùVeni seemed to listen to what I was saying with interest, although I could also see that most of it went over her head. She flicked her tail back and forth as she seemed to be thinking about what I said, before finally replying.

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt fully understand what your job is, but it certainly sounds interesting! Maybe once you‚Äôre settled, you can show me what it is that you do?\~‚Äù I took a moment to consider her request. I suppose it couldn‚Äôt hurt to show her what I do. After all, it could help alleviate any worries about my line of work being ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù. Using my best customer service voice, I cheerfully replied to her ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôd be delighted to show you what I do! Although, I must warn you that it isn‚Äôt nearly as interesting as it sounds.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre showing me it, I doubt I‚Äôll be bored‚Ä¶ As for my next question, I simply must know what you *predators* do for entertainment. During my research on your museum, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice a massive park across the street from your museum. Was it some sort of reserve to hunt?‚Äù Veni asked me, her voice once again briefly taking on that slightly flirty edge. I didn‚Äôt have time to dwell on it, as her second question blindsided me.¬†

‚ÄúNo, Central Park isn‚Äôt a reserve for hunting. It‚Äôs just a big park that people can enjoy. In fact, hunting it in is illegal. Anyway, there‚Äôs a lot of things we humans do for entertainment. Every Friday after work, a whole bunch of the museum staff would go out for drinks at one of the local bars. It was fun, getting to mingle with staff you wouldn‚Äôt normally see often. As for what else we do for entertainment, well we‚Äôd do all sorts of things. Hell, the city has almost limitless options, ranging from art galleries, to theater and so much more.‚Äù¬†

She took a moment to respond, before she excitedly told me ‚ÄúHuh, I thought that it almost certainly would‚Äôve been a hunting reserve.‚Äù She paused and then in that same somewhat flirty voice, added ‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs a couple bars here in town. Your tradition of going to a bar every ‚Äòfriday‚Äô can continue! Although hopefully, I can join too\~ You humans are fascinating\~ I mean, who would think that predators would make art, nevermind have whole buildings dedicated to it! And theater! It all sounds so wonderful!‚Äù¬†

Her reactions to my answers confused me. Weren‚Äôt exterminators supposed to be strongly against anything ‚Äòpredatory‚Äô? Yet, here she was, sounding almost enamored with many of the things I was telling her. There wasn‚Äôt even a hint of malice in her voice, instead, there was quite the opposite. In fact, it almost seemed like she was hitting on me at points, although I simply chalked that up to cultural and linguistic differences.¬†

I waited for her to ask her next question, only to hear Nira call out from the front of the van. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here!‚Äù This was followed by the van gently coasting to a stop. Looking out the window at the back of the van I could see that we were in what appeared to be a residential neighborhood. Veni called out ‚ÄúAlright, Nira. I‚Äôll help Dr. Chambers to Teva‚Äôs house. You can stay in the van if you‚Äôd like‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù replied Nira. Veni then got out of her seat and opened the back door of the van, before grabbing one of my suitcases. I followed her lead and grabbed my duffle bag and other suitcase, before reaching for the fruit basket. As I reached for it, she also reached for it, telling me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll get it‚Äù¬†

I let her take the basket, and made my way out of the van. Once my feet hit the ‚Äúpavement‚Äù I could tell something was different. It wasn‚Äôt like the asphalt back home. Instead, it was soft and almost spongy. I didn‚Äôt really dwell on it as I stretched a little. Veni soon followed me out of the van, still not wearing her hood. She gestured for me to follow with her tail, or at least that‚Äôs what I think she meant, and led me towards a squat, almost hexagonal, two story house. Once she reached the door, she rang the doorbell and waited.¬†

I stood next to her as she quietly told me ‚ÄúBe careful, Teva can be‚Ä¶ she can be a little skittish. I‚Äôve accidentally scared her before. So, just don‚Äôt make any sudden or ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô movements.‚Äù As the doorbell rang, I could hear someone shuffling around inside the house. The shuffling sound grew a little louder as Teva reached the door. Slowly, the door creaked open, revealing one of the shortest venlil I‚Äôve ever seen. She didn‚Äôt even come up to my shoulder. Not only was she short, but her sandy-brown wool was some of the fluffiest wool I‚Äôve seen in a while.

She looked around, first spotting Veni. A little nervously, she tells Veni ‚ÄúO-oh hello there Veni‚Ä¶ I-Is there a problem?‚Äù She then spotted me, and froze. She looked up at me for a second, before sprinting off into her house. I could only watch in horror as she sprinted towards what seemed to be her coffee table.¬†

***THUNK***

My horror only grew as I watched her run at full speed into the table. Glancing over at Veni, I could see that she was equally horrified‚Ä¶

In ep1, upon meeting sister Megan, Lois takes Megan into the break room for coffee from the Italian coffee maker her husband bought (also, odd to me that he'd buy a coffee maker for the police station). They both have coffee cups with what I assume is coffee. Lois starts telling the story of the Burnside murders in the break room.

It then transitions to the crime scene for about 20 seconds and then back to Lois and Megan at her desk in the office.  Lois' telling of the murders has no break or interruptions other than the visuals. It's not as if they stood up and moved to the desk while telling the story.

Lifetime on an off insomniac here. I am 30F, otherwise very healthy. No medical conditions, healthy weight, eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, I don‚Äôt drink and don‚Äôt smoke (recently 30 days fully sober after a few years of maybe 3-4 drinks a month). I drink one cup of coffee in the morning and maybe a Diet Coke around noon. Melatonin doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôve tried all the commonly mentioned tricks like magnesium, sleep hygiene, etc. Sometimes indulge in a CBN/THC gummy (this seems to help falling asleep but still wake up too early and can‚Äôt fall asleep). I have recently lost 20 pounds. Sometimes take Zzquil. I share a bed with a partner that sometimes snores, but I experience the problem I‚Äôll describe below when sleeping alone also. Recently went off B vitamin supplements as I feared it was causing sleep disruption, but it‚Äôs too soon to tell. 

I have always had trouble falling asleep, to the tune of taking 1-2 hours sometimes. Typically sleep great once I do fall asleep and never had trouble sleeping in or staying asleep.  In the last 6 months, I have begun waking up at 5am, nearly on the dot, and most of the time cannot fall back asleep. I often work until 11pm so this has really messed me up, as I used to be able to sleep in after my later shifts. Schedule rotates from 10-4, 4-11, or 11-11. I wear a Fitbit to track sleep and after night shifts find myself suffering through grogginess and bad moods the next day, on 4.5 hours of sleep. Has anyone encountered this and been able to change their newfound sucky habit? 

I have made so many good strides with my health and my messed up sleep is the final frustrating thing I‚Äôm dealing with. I feel like I might need less sleep than a typical human, but I‚Äôve often felt like my body just doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúoff‚Äù switch.

For the past 3 months, I've been ruminating about everything I've done wrong in the relationship, and it won't stop. This is affecting our relationship, and I'm afraid I might push him to break up if I don't find a way to stop. I keep thinking back to when we first met in college. We lived in the same building and that's how we met. When we met for the first time, I had so much fun, but I wasn't entirely sure. At that time, I had no experience with guys at all, only chatting online. We hung out twice, and then I went back home. During those two weeks, I started chatting online with another guy, and I really liked him because he was direct, while my current boyfriend wasn‚Äôt showing any direct signs. And during those two weeks, he didn‚Äôt text me very often. When I returned to the city where I studied, I went for coffee with this other guy, and I didn‚Äôt like him. The very next day, I started liking my current boyfriend. I keep blaming myself for not knowing right away and for even talking to someone else.

The next thing I think about is that I couldn‚Äôt open up to him about private things, and that blocked me from committing to the relationship earlier. I have alopecia and wear a wig, and I didn‚Äôt want to commit to the relationship because I felt like I was withholding something important if he didn‚Äôt know.

There are some private things I didn‚Äôt tell him until now. I felt ashamed of the fact that I live with my family in a very small apartment, share a room with my brother, and my parents sleep in the living room. Everything is pretty old. I never talked about the issues at home with my brother, who hasn‚Äôt worked in a long time. Now I realize that none of those things are abnormal or something to be ashamed of. I feel like it really affected our relationship that I couldn‚Äôt open up about it.

The last thing I regret is related to sex. But that‚Äôs actually about my need for control. It was always important to me what date we had our first kiss, the date we officially started dating, and I wanted the first time we had sex to be with rose petals, candles... I regret wanting to control all of that. So it ended up happening six months after the official start of our relationship, although we had done other things in the meantime. I feel like I made that whole beginning more difficult. I hadn‚Äôt resolved everything within myself before meeting him, and I wasn‚Äôt mature enough for a relationship, and I regret not being able to give him everything.

----------------------------------------------

When it comes to building a home, one of the most exciting aspects is the chance to take advantage of stunning views. Whether it's a picturesque mountain range, a serene lake, or a vibrant city skyline, house plans designed for view enhance the living experience. Properly integrating these views into your home‚Äôs design can create a space that is not only beautiful but also functional.

In this regard, orientation is key. The way your home sits on the land determines how much of these stunning sights will be visible from inside your living spaces. Here are some important considerations for optimizing views:

- **Site Analysis:** Before you lay out your house plans, study the landscape. Identify the best views from different angles. Consider how the sunlight shifts throughout the day.
- **Building Orientation:** Position your home to face the views directly. Large windows and strategically placed balconies can ensure you do not miss out on nature‚Äôs display.
- **Landscape Design:** Incorporate outdoor living spaces like decks and patios. This invites the outdoors in, allowing you to enjoy the view wherever you are in your home.

Windows play a pivotal role in house plans designed for view. The type and placement of windows should maximize your scenic backdrop while keeping energy efficiency in mind. Here are some tips for choosing the right windows:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
- **Large Picture Windows:** These are ideal for framing picturesque views. They offer expansive sightlines and fill your space with natural light.
- **Floor-to-Ceiling Windows:** This design can create a seamless connection between the indoors and outdoors, offering a panoramic view.
- **Window Shapes:** Consider unique shapes like arches or casements. These add character and can frame the view artistically.

Your indoor layout should also be carefully considered when designing house plans for view. Open floor plans allow for flexibility and can enhance the experience of the view from different rooms. Here are some layout ideas:

- **Main Living Area:** Place the living room or dining area with direct access to the view. This becomes the focal point of the home.
- **Bedrooms:** If a view is particularly breathtaking, consider orienting master suites to take advantage of it. Morning views can enhance your daily routine.
- **Multi-level Designs:** If your property has elevation changes, multi-level designs can provide different vantage points. Each level can offer unique perspectives.

Beyond just the view, don‚Äôt forget about outdoor elements that can affect your house plan. Here are some ways to enhance your outdoor spaces:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
- **Decks and Balconies:** Create spaces to enjoy the exterior view while still enjoying the comforts of home.
- **Landscaping Considerations:** Use trees and shrubs to frame the view rather than obstruct it. Carefully placed plants can enhance the scenery.
- **Outdoor Lighting:** soft lighting around patios or on pathways can create a magical experience during evening hours.

One important aspect often overlooked is the material selection. Choosing the right materials can enhance both the home‚Äôs aesthetics and create a comfortable atmosphere for enjoying views. Materials can reflect or absorb heat efficiently, helping in maintaining energy costs while enjoying the best outlook.

In addition to traditional materials, consider eco-friendly options. They not only signify a commitment to the environment but often provide better insulation, contributing to a more cozy home.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
Remember that house plans designed for view should consider local building regulations and homeowners‚Äô association guidelines. These may dictate the height of your home or the distance from the property line, which can impact your ability to take full advantage of the views.

Your home should be a place of comfort, beauty, and connection to the surrounding landscape. By thoughtfully designing your house plans for scenic views, you can create a living space that amplifies the beauty of its environment while providing you and your loved ones with an inviting retreat.

The Importance of Natural Light in Homes with Stunning Landscapes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In homes designed to embrace stunning landscapes, the role of natural light cannot be overstated. It plays a crucial part in shaping the ambiance, energy efficiency, and overall aesthetic appeal of living spaces. When strategically incorporated, natural light can illuminate breathtaking views and enhance your living experience.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
Homes that capitalize on natural light with expansive windows or open floor plans can create a seamless connection between indoor comfort and outdoor beauty. Below, we delve into several important aspects that demonstrate the significance of natural light in homes framed by picturesque landscapes.

### Benefits of Natural Light

Natural light enhances your living environment in multiple ways:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
- **Improved Mood:** Exposure to sunlight helps elevate your mood. Natural light promotes the production of serotonin, a chemical in the brain associated with happiness and well-being.
- **Energy Efficiency:** By utilizing natural light, you can reduce the need for artificial lighting during the day. This not only saves energy but also lowers electricity bills.
- **Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Beautiful landscapes are best admired in sunlight. Large windows allow you to frame outdoor views, turning your home into a canvas of nature.
- **Natural Ventilation:** Homes that incorporate natural light often have a design that encourages airflow. Good ventilation helps reduce indoor humidity and enhances air quality.
- **Health Benefits:** Natural light can improve sleep patterns as it regulates your circadian rhythm. More exposure to daylight during the day promotes better sleep at night.

### Design Strategies to Maximize Natural Light

Designing a home with an emphasis on natural light requires careful planning. Here are some advanced strategies to consider:

#### Large Windows and Glass Doors

Large windows or sliding glass doors blurs the boundaries between indoor and outdoor areas. Floors-to-ceiling windows can bring in ample sunlight while allowing breathtaking views from multiple angles. Consider placing windows where you can enjoy the landscape in different aspects as the day progresses.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
#### Open Floor Plans

An open floor plan encourages a free flow of light throughout the space. When rooms are connected without rigid walls, light can travel easily, illuminating areas that would otherwise remain dim. Open designs can create an inviting atmosphere while showcasing nature's beauty outside.

#### Skylights and Clerestory Windows

Skylights or clerestory windows can significantly increase the natural light entering your home, particularly in spaces with limited wall space for traditional windows. Skylights direct light from above, while clerestory windows, placed high on walls, allow sunlight to filter in without compromising privacy.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
#### Strategic Landscaping

Your landscape design can also influence the amount of light entering your home. When planning your garden, consider planting trees and shrubs that frame your view without blocking too much sunlight. Positioning plants carefully can also provide natural shade where needed.

#### Reflective Surfaces

Utilizing reflective surfaces like mirrors can amplify the effects of natural light in your home. Mirrors, especially when placed opposite windows, can bounce light around the space, creating a brighter and more open environment.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
### Creating a Harmonious Balance

Finding the right balance between natural light and effective shading can enhance comfort. It's important to consider the orientation of your home. East-facing windows might be ideal for morning sunlight, while west-facing windows can capture stunning sunset views.

Additionally, using adjustable window treatments like shades, blinds, or drapes allow you to control the amount of light entering a room. This flexibility lets you enjoy natural light without overheating or creating glare.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  

Natural light in homes designed for stunning landscapes is more than an aesthetic choice; it embraces several health benefits and energy-saving qualities. By focusing on design strategies that maximize light, you can create a revitalizing atmosphere that enhances your overall living experience.

Natural light serves as a bridge between the comfort of indoor spaces and the beauty of the outdoors, enriching your home and your life.

### Conclusion

Creating house plans specifically designed for breathtaking views not only enhances aesthetic appeal but also enriches daily living experiences. When you focus on capturing scenic landscapes, you invite nature into your home, making it a serene sanctuary. By including large windows and open spaces, you bring the beauty of the outdoors inside, allowing you to enjoy stunning vistas from the comfort of your living room or kitchen.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-designed-for-view  
  
Moreover, the strategic placement of windows is crucial for maximizing natural light. Homes that use ample daylight help create a cheerful, vibrant atmosphere that can improve your mood and productivity. The interplay between light and landscape transforms every room into an evolving gallery, showcasing seasonal changes and the natural world outside.

Additionally, combining spacious layouts with outdoor spaces allows you to engage with your surroundings fully. Whether it's a cozy deck for morning coffee or a patio for evening gatherings, these features provide a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor living, enhancing your overall lifestyle.

When designing your ideal home, always consider how the architecture interacts with the environment. From positioning to material choices, each element should work harmoniously to highlight the beautiful views that make your property unique. Ultimately, house plans thoughtfully created for views aren‚Äôt just about aesthetics; they‚Äôre about enhancing your quality of life and creating a personal oasis that celebrates the beauty of nature.

1g51ahw,https://i.redd.it/f41n60nlt4vd1.jpeg,Amazing Specialty Coffee roasters in Tokyo & Kanagawa,"I wanted to share some of my recent favorite roasters, especially ones that are not part of the bigger ones (Glitch, Leaves, Mameya, ‚Ä¶).

Feel free to add yours with reasons for why you like them!

*Important note*: I mainly drink light roast filter coffee and often chase unique flavors (both in washed/naturally processed beans and in co-fermented beans)

*1) Radar Room* - Online

Radar Room is a brand new microroaster operating from Tokyo, offering a small but always unique and amazing coffee bean selection. 
The roaster is a former barista from Glitch, the former head barista from Dark Arts and a guest barista at the famous QIMA booth at this year‚Äôs SCAJ (which is where he sources his beans from). Amazing quality and super friendly and approachable guy!

*2) Dark Arts Coffee Japan* - Hayama

- Great value for money beans ‚òïÔ∏è 
- Amazing single origin espresso drinks and filters
- Cool vibes & the tastiest food (with vegan options)

-> My personal favorite in Kanagawa

*3) Raw Sugar Roast* - Setagaya

- Best value for money beans ‚òïÔ∏è 
- Huge selection of amazing light roasts
- Laptop friendly

-> My personal favorite in Tokyo

*4) Seven Years Coffee* - Setagaya

The Barista and Owner from Seven Years is a well known barista trainer and his coffee preparation is mesmerizing to observe. He hand selects every single bean for every order and his latte art is unparalleled. He also produces his almond milk himself and the interior is very homey. His beans are more on the medium-light side but always tasty.

He shares his shop with an independent barber and a drink at his coffee shop is included with every haircut you get üòÖ

*5) Kielo Coffee* - Akihabara, Ginza, Bunkyo

Probably the most known roaster from this list. Great selection of light roasts, creative drinks (recommend the banana espresso shake), a fully vegan branch in Bunkyo (Be Green), amazing sweets and I appreciate them from opening shops in areas where there are not many great options for specialty coffee enthusiasts.

*6) Glitch - but not crowded: Covert Coffee, Nadoya no Katte, Horikawa Coffee*

If you desperately want to drink Glitch Coffee, but you want to skip the busy main shops, then you should check these 3 options out.
They are in Shinjuku (Covert), Yoyogi-Uehara (Nadoya) and in Kanagawa (Horikawa). They are far less crowded, while offering Glitch coffee in a more relaxing atmosphere.

*7) Acid Coffee* - Shibuya/Yoyogi-Uehara

- Amazing bean selection going from popular farms to CoE microlots 
- Options for half cups to save some money or compare two coffees at a better price
- unfortunately very pricey for buying beans


Honarable mentions:
- Red Poison Yokohama (expensive but amazing coffees in an area that is lacking great specialty coffee options)
- Mermaid Coffee Roasters Ikebukuro (they let you taste all their filter offerings prior to ordering)
- Aka Ahma Coffee (mostly light roasts from Thailand with very interesting flavor notes - a nice change from the usual South American and African coffees)",6,1729090435.0,coffeejp,1,1.0,False

Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, not really anything personal. We both are teachers and we teach similar subjects. 

Usually when I‚Äôm in public, I put on a mask that I‚Äôm very confident, but deep down I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm currently going to therapy for this so I can change how I talk to myself.

I really wanna ask her out for coffee, but I can‚Äôt muster up the courage to do so, probably because I put her on a pedestal and how I talk to myself. 

I feel like I get signs from her though.

I didn't want to argue so I just took the venti but I'm still confused why she couldn't just make it in a venti.

I haven't worked at Starbucks for a LONG time, so maybe things have changed. But we used to measure the milk for steaming in the pitcher, just poured it up to the grande line and steamed it and then put it in the cup. We also used to make grande drip coffees in venti cups when people wanted a ton of room in their cups.

Do you guys no longer have the steamer measurements anymore? Has policy changed so that you can no longer make a smaller drink in a larger cup? Was she just misunderstanding what I wanted?",7,1729090249.0,starbucks,5,1.0,False

We've been on a couple of dates and hung out at her house a couple of times. I pass her place every day when I pick up my coffee before I go into work. We weren't exclusive but I didn't really have a problem with that at the time.

A day ago, after we had been talking about missing each other, she tells me she has Chlamydia and might have passed it to me. I'm a little angry, but again we aren't exclusive, so it's not a big deal. I am very certain she didn't get it from me, but just to make sure I didn't get it from her I go and get tested. Results pending (5-7 days)

I go out with a friend and grab a beer to cool off. Once I had enough to not be mad, I consider that she is probably having a worse day than me. So, like I had done less than a week before, I go out and buy her some roses to leave on her porch in hopes that it would cheer her up. It worked the first time and she seemed happy.

It's around 8 PM when I drop them off and there is an extra car in her driveway. I almost drove off without leaving the flowers but then I thought to myself ""F*** it, this girl might have just given me Chlamydia and I just spent $25 on these. She's getting the flowers."" I didn't want to mess with anything she had going on so I left them on her porch furniture and send her a text before leaving. 

The next morning I woke up to a text saying that leaving her gifts without notice is a violation of her privacy, makes her feel uncomfortable, and we shouldn't see each other again. So I'm assuming I ruined her night because Chlamydia boy saw the flowers I bought her. I didn't really invade her privacy any more than the mailman does but I'm sure it ruined her night.

I constantly get behind on my reports and data processing because ADHD reasons, which leads to the usual stress-induced work explosion every few weeks.

Anyone experience this and if they could give advice on how to break this cycle/establish a more productive work routine I would very much appreciate it. 

My current thoughts are:
- Exercise more to get rid of excess energy
- Do NOT forget to take your meds
- Meds before coffee, obviously wait a couple hours before intaking caffeine while using a stimulant but still
- Go into the office more, having the proper environment can help with focus
- Make sure I have clear deadlines for my work from my managers

Every year I try to go above and beyond and make it special for her. Every year she's not remotely appreciative. But also gives me conflicting information and comments. 

Her birthday isn't a big deal. I don't need to spend a bunch of money on her. It's just another day. We don't have to do anything. As long as I get her a nice coffee in the morning, make her/take her to breakfast, get her some flowers, do X, Y, Z that's good enough. 

...what?

Same thing this year. I feel like I'm being set up to fail. I've asked her several times the last month or so what she wants to do for her birthday. And to please give me some ideas for gifts she'd like. So I have time to make arrangements. 

She's repeatedly ignored my requests. 

Finally the other day she told me for things she'd like to do she wants me to take her shopping, run her a bath, or go to a waterfall. And sent me a handful of gift ideas. 

Okay, great. I bought her some gifts. That part is taken care of. Doesn't really matter what I get her for gifts. It's always the same outcome. She says thanks but acts disappointed/sad that I didn't get her ""the right gifts"" that she ""really wanted."" I also didn't get her enough gifts. She wants numerous gifts to open because that's how I show her I really care and love her, by buying her several gifts. Even though I buy her 3-5 gifts every single birthday, it's never enough. 

For the ideas she gave me on stuff to do: There are no waterfalls right now near us that aren't dried up. Sure, I can run her a bath. Every time I offer though she says no, she's not in the mood or she can do it herself. Including on her birthday in past years. And taking her shopping is a fucking recipe for disaster. What happens every single time is we go to a mall/store(s) and she walks around for 20-30 minutes getting increasingly annoyed/irritated/agitated. Says several times she hates shopping for herself. Then says we can go, she's had enough. And then acts like an asshole to me for several hours/the rest of the day. 

I hate it so much. I feel like no matter how hard I try, how much I do, I'm set up for failure. I've honestly thought about just doing nothing and buying her nothing and saving myself the hassle, but then she'll just have an even bigger meltdown.

Then last night she once again mentioned how I don't need to go crazy spending a bunch of money on her. I go overboard and it's not needed. She doesn't need a bunch of gifts or money spent on her for her birthday. As long as I get her a nice coffee, take her out to eat, take her shopping, run her a bath, and get her a dessert she'll enjoy, that's good enough.

Put a magnaflow exhaust on because the original was falling apart. If anybody wants to know, it doesn‚Äôt sound like a coffee can thank god and is only slightly louder than stock. looks way better than the original as well. Only other things that I replaced was some brake rotors and callipers 6 months ago. 

The matrix is the perfect size for me, I‚Äôve helped people move and car camped while not having to worry about parking a huge car all the time. 

The sound insulation leaves some room for improvement, you have to yell a bit on the highway to talk to somebody in the back seat. I know my exhaust didn‚Äôt help but idc i like the way it looks and sounds almost any other time. 

The front bumper is a little different shade than the rest of the car because I replaced it. For the life of me I can‚Äôt find paint that matches the original. The OEM seems to have a green tint to it that isn‚Äôt in any of the paints claiming to be a match. If anybody knows anything about this please let me know.

I‚Äôm 30 years old, and I find myself in a pretty comfortable financial position:

* **$400K in mutual funds, Individual Stocks, IRA**
* **$600K house completely paid off**
* **No debt whatsoever**
* **Stable work-from-home job** earning over six figures annually

I've always been extremely frugal and disciplined with my money. I saved aggressively throughout my 20s, and now I‚Äôm at a point where I have a solid financial cushion and no immediate financial worries. I know I‚Äôm in a position that many people work their whole lives for, and I‚Äôm extremely grateful. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to ask myself, *what‚Äôs next*?

For years, my focus has been on building wealth and achieving financial independence, but now that I‚Äôm here, I feel a bit lost. I don‚Äôt have any pressing financial goals, and I‚Äôm finding it hard to figure out what to do with my life. I guess I always thought having financial security would bring me a sense of fulfillment, but it turns out that‚Äôs not the whole story.

I‚Äôve listened to **a lot of Dave Ramsey** over the years, and his advice on being debt-free, investing, and building wealth has shaped a lot of my financial decisions. About **30% of the money I have today was inherited** (gratefully), but I didn‚Äôt spend a dime of it. As soon as I received it, I felt like it wasn‚Äôt mine to spend‚Äîit was hard-earned by someone else. So I invested it right away in mutual funds, wanting to honor that money by growing it instead of spending it.

On top of that, I‚Äôve always been super frugal. Even though I make well over six figures, I still drive a 15-year-old car (2011 LR4) and debate whether I should buy a $5 coffee. And while I‚Äôd **love** to upgrade to a nice car (I‚Äôve been eyeing a New Land Rover Defender or something fun to drive), I can‚Äôt shake the thought that it‚Äôs not a wise financial decision. ‚ÄúWhy spend money on something depreciating when I could invest it?‚Äù

Same with vacations. I‚Äôd **love** to travel more and see the world, but I‚Äôm hesitant because it means taking PTO from my job. I don‚Äôt want to lose the momentum or be seen as slacking, even though I know I‚Äôm financially secure. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck between wanting to enjoy life now and holding on to that sense of frugality and security I‚Äôve been so focused on for years.

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I don‚Äôt have enough money where I can just go out and splurge on big-ticket items like fancy cars, boats, or other high-end material things without it making a dent. But I do have enough where I can live comfortably, at least by my own standards. I‚Äôm in that weird middle ground where I‚Äôve built a lot of security, but not quite enough where I feel comfortable spending on luxury items.

One thing to note: I have **zero interest in having kids**, so building a legacy through a family isn‚Äôt part of my future plans. I feel like that‚Äôs something a lot of people my age focus on, but it just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me. That‚Äôs probably contributing to the whole ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù dilemma because, without that traditional family goal, I‚Äôm not sure what I should be striving for.

I‚Äôm at a point where I want to find something more‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a new passion, giving back in some way, or just learning how to *enjoy* what I‚Äôve worked so hard for. But I don‚Äôt know where to start.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How do you find purpose once you‚Äôve hit your financial goals? Do I just need to start spending a bit more and enjoy life, or is there something deeper I should be exploring?

I had a drainless Modified TT - skin-only, lipo, and no MR.

Some history: I had two c-sections and my kids are now 11 and 14.

I am petite. 5‚Äô 1‚Äù and was 128 pounds before surgery and now weigh 127. I had a sack of blobby skin removed that was leftover from pregnancies and it feels AMAZING to have it be gone.

My surgeon used surgical glue on my BB so it looks gnarly and that glue will come off at 1 MPO along with the surgical tape. It will be the bug reveal!

I am walking as often as I can and have the energy to. I track steps on my phone. 
I started with 2500 steps last Thursday and the last two days I have made it to 3600 steps (1.8 miles). This walking is done outside or inside my home and not in big chunks.

There is still swelling but even with swelling I look so much better I don‚Äôt mind it! I included two before photos at the end of the gallery. The other photos are from today.

I was told I can sleep on my side but I haven‚Äôt yet because I am sleeping so soundly with my cushy reading pillow tucked in with other pillows in my bed.

Today my incision hurts on one side whenever I try to bend over so I am avoiding that‚Ä¶ouch.

I am 100% upright but sometimes at the end of the day only at 95% and I am SO tired by 8:30pm.

Oh, last night I had Chinese food and guess what? I didn‚Äôt swell up like a balloon! I think the key is stying hydrated. I drink only water all day long except for my morning cup of coffee.

I also have been taking bromelain for three weeks as well as arnica. I take a bunch of other supplements too. B12 is excellent for wound healing by the way! :)

My mood is better and I feel more positive. I was pretty freaked out the first week. Feeling has returned to most of my stomach except for below my belly button. I expect incision is numb to but I don‚Äôt touch it.",48,1729088917.0,tummytucksurgery,17,1.0,False

Performance- 9/10 

The only reason it isn‚Äôt a 10 is because it almost lasts too long. I sprayed a spray on my wrist yesterday evening around 6:30, it‚Äôs now 10:15am the next day and the wrist area of my jack still very strongly smells like it. On skin it lasts around 12-14 hours, becoming a skin scent after around 5-6.

Scent- 8.5/10

This would be a little higher, but unfortunately the scent isn‚Äôt very versatile and a lot of people I know who smelt it really didn‚Äôt like it, although I quite enjoy it. It opens with this rum and crisp apple note, and dries down to more of a rum tobacco. If the apple was more potent in the dry down it would definitely be closer to a 9.5 for me.

Bottle- 5/10 

Typical pineward bottle, not ugly but nothing notable. Atomizer feels slightly cheap.

Sample- 8/10

Figured I‚Äôd throw in the sample. The sample I got was mint cocoa, which to my knowledge is releasing along with coffee tobacco, which I‚Äôm also interested to smell. 

This one is exactly what it sounds like. Mint and cocoa with some powdery aspect to tie it together. The chocolate part smells rich and dark, which I actually quite enjoy. I didn‚Äôt expect to enjoy this type  of fragrance, but I actually will probably be purchasing a full bottle when it releases this winter. Just a fair warning, it is quite strong, and I could smell the sample when I opened the packaging, so if you don‚Äôt like chocolate scents, that one definitely isn‚Äôt for you.",5,1729088793.0,fragrance,3,1.0,False

Heres the back story:

About 15 years ago I went to a birthday party and had some bbq food. The next day I was in screaming pain, my stomach hurt so bad. Went to a gastro and told me I had acid reflux (i'm a teenager). Fast forward 5 years later I was living on multiple iced coffees, fast food, smoking and not taking care of myself at all. Stomach issues include gargling sounds, burning sensation and constipation. Never experienced anxiety before until I had my first panic attack. Since then, I have not been able to figure out what was going on. Doctors keep trying to put me on antidepressants. I've learned to manage them a little better but I still get all the physical symptoms. I have done years of therapy, yoga, meditation, vagus nerve tapping and nothing works. I even get anxiety/panic feeling when i'm just sitting and relaxing or eating! It feels as my body is inflamed on the inside and something is triggering it! I'm always out of breath, exhausted, dizzy, extreme brain fog and anxious.

I then started to really think about my life when I started feeling sick and may have thought this could all be from my stomach issues that I never took care of? I changed my diet around a year ago and only eat farm fresh veggies, fruits and grass-fed meats, kefir, no processed sugars or processed foods. All of my products and things I use at home are non-toxic, stainless pans, no seed oils you name it, I have it. I started a probiotic about 3 months ago and experienced some die off symptoms (gave me hope that its something in my stomach). Kind of helped my constipation! So I was excited about that. I found a functional doctor and did a GI map (still waiting on results). I just want to know if I should try regulating my nervous system? Should I try retraining my brain? 

I just want a baby so bad but I need to regulate myself first!! It hurts to think this is whats holding me back but I just want to be the best mom I can be. Any advice here is greatly appreciated

The morgue was silent except for the soft hum of the overhead lights. I sat at the desk, staring at the stainless-steel cabinets lining the wall.

*Thud... Thud...*

It wasn‚Äôt loud, but it came from somewhere in the back‚Äîwhere the bodies were kept. I froze, the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.

I told myself it was just a noise from the ventilation system. Old buildings like this creak, groan, and make weird sounds all the time. But something about that thudding noise felt‚Ä¶ deliberate. It sounded like someone knocking.

I grabbed the flashlight from the desk and forced myself to walk toward the cold chambers. As I approached the drawers, the air felt heavier, almost suffocating, like the temperature had dropped several degrees. My breath fogged in front of me.

Then I saw it: Drawer #7 was *slightly* ajar.

I swore I‚Äôd closed them all earlier. My heart started pounding in my chest, but I tried to convince myself it was just an oversight. Maybe I‚Äôd forgotten to latch it properly. That‚Äôs all. Nothing weird. Just a tired mistake.

With trembling hands, I reached for the handle and slid the drawer open. The body inside belonged to a woman in her early 30s. Her file said she was found drowned in a lake a few days ago. Her skin was bloated and pale, lips tinged with blue, eyes shut tight like she‚Äôd drifted off into an eternal sleep.

I stared at her for a moment longer than I should have, feeling a strange discomfort settle deep in my gut. Something was off. Then, just as I was about to push the drawer back in, I heard it‚Äî

A *giggle*.

Soft. Childlike.

It came from her.

I stumbled back, dropping the flashlight. The beam rolled across the floor, casting long shadows along the walls. My stomach churned with dread, but I forced myself to look at the corpse again.

Her eyes were open.

They shouldn‚Äôt have been open. They were sealed shut when I first looked. But now those lifeless, glassy eyes stared straight into mine. And her lips... her lips were curled into a faint, twisted smile.

I froze, unable to move, as her jaw twitched. Then, with an awful, wet cracking sound, she *spoke*.

‚ÄúWhy are you scared?‚Äù she whispered, her voice raspy and filled with mockery. ""You don't belong here... but *I do*.""

Her words sent an icy stab through my spine. Every instinct in me screamed to run, but my legs refused to cooperate.

She blinked‚Äî*twice*. I swear I saw her blink.

Then the smile widened, grotesque and wrong, stretching far too wide for a human mouth. Her cheeks split at the corners, oozing something black and oily that dribbled down her chin.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay with me, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù she crooned, her voice like nails scraping glass. ‚ÄúForever... just like me.‚Äù

The temperature plummeted even further, and I felt my limbs grow numb, like the cold was creeping into my bones.

And then she *laughed*.

It wasn‚Äôt just a laugh. It was a cackle‚Äîloud, shrill, and filled with malice. It echoed through the room, bouncing off the metal drawers, growing louder and louder until it sounded like dozens of voices laughing along with her.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the desk, knocking everything off in a frantic mess. The corpse in the drawer began to move, twisting her body in unnatural ways‚Äîher neck bending, her joints cracking as if she was a puppet pulled by invisible strings.

Her grin remained, locked on me as her body slid off the drawer and hit the floor with a sickening *splat*. She lay there for a moment, limbs bent at impossible angles, before she slowly crawled toward me, dragging her bloated, dripping body across the floor.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run,‚Äù she whispered. ‚Äú*It‚Äôs rude to leave when someone‚Äôs talking to you.*‚Äù

My heart pounded in my chest, and I turned to bolt for the exit‚Äîonly to find the door slammed shut. I yanked on the handle, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. The lights above flickered, buzzing violently, casting brief flashes of her grotesque form crawling closer and closer.

Then, the lights went out entirely.

I was plunged into the dark, with only the sound of her dragging body getting closer. And closer. And closer.

Just as I thought she was about to reach me, the lights flickered back on. She was gone.

But the drawer... the drawer was wide open, and inside was *my own body*, lifeless and cold, staring back at me with dull, empty eyes.

And then, from behind me, I heard it‚Äî

A voice, identical to mine, whispering:

‚ÄúWhy do you look so scared? You don‚Äôt belong here... but I do.‚Äù

The last thing I remember before everything went black was the sound of *my own voice* mocking me‚Äî

And the corpse...  
Laughing.

Will things ever work out or better to give up?,"My girlfriend (29F) is so jealous and anxious that I (30M) cannot deal with it anymore.

My girlfriend is extremely insecure, anxious and I suspect she has some sort of trauma-induced bi-polar disorder and ADHD.

She is so jealous that she has come to the point where she started accusing me of hiding things from her for the most stupid things. I went motorcycling and she saw a photo of me in a group of 10 people where there were also 2 girls. She started saying that I am seeing these girls and that I chose the pictures I sent her on purpose to make it look like it was just males. And that explains why I go motorcycling every weekend and so on and so forth. That is even if I told her there were girls but told her they are not my type at all, while she finds them attractive.

We also had some discussions because she wants to occasionally be able to take drinks/coffee or going to the pool with male friends or acquaintances¬†*one-on-one*, which is a boundary for me. She even came to the point of saying that it is a double standard that I train martial arts where girls wear shorts but she cannot hang out solo with male friends. I encouraged her instead to do activities like playing board games and so on, even if she will be surrounded by guys.

When she starts getting insecure there is nothing I can say to reassure her to the point I lose my patience and start saying nasty things to her that she later on brings up to shame me. Unfortunately, I also have made mistakes last summer that undermined her trust in me (although she did the same too and I did those things in response, nothing serious anyway).

Today, after we argued yesterday night about the motorcycling group, she started crying and having a sort of anxiety attack about me not wanting to be with her because tonight I wanted to go to one of my hobby classes (which is once a week) instead of staying to take care of her for her panic/anxiety attack. She insisted so much that I had to agree skipping class because she feels like I do not care about her and she cannot rely on me when she is sick.

I do not want to live like this. She even insists so much when these things happen that I arrive late for work. I keep telling myself that maybe, if instead of snapping, I were thoughtful all the time, we could avoid arguing so much. The problem is, that I am sure we will keep having these type of fights, Something new will always emerge about how I am not caring enough, affectionate enough, or some girls will pop up and she will have a right to be jealous.

I do not think things will ever work out and thinking about breaking up. How can I decide whether I should keep trying to make things work or give up? This is becoming stressful and not adding any value to my life. I think I love this girl but cannot see a future with her. I also do not think I should skip my hobbies when she is feeling anxious or mentally sick for something she brought up.",0,1729088334.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

1g50fur,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1g50fur/never_mess_with_work_moms_coworkers/,"Never mess with ""work mom's"" co-workers","While I appreciate petty revenge that takes a while to carry out, this is a much more simple, quick story that culminated due to ""the consequences of your actions"" with one particular team that my team has been having problems with.

Context: I (34f) have a nickname at work with the new hires that we hired on earlier this year, which is ""Work Mom"". One new hire (I'll call her G, 34f) started it because I had literally everything on hand at my desk to help her when she randomly got stung by a bee. I love it because that sums me up in a nut shell personality wise. I tell our team and teams we work closely with that if they ever need something from my desk or coffee nook, that they're welcome to it and to just tell me when they had to take something after the fact.

G is also very kind and caring and loves making connections with our teams and trying to help out in anyway she can so that she can be as well rounded of an employee as possible. It's great and her and I work off of each other very well due to this. From what little I can tell about my work, I'm in QA (Quality Assurance) and majority of our time every year is spent doing quarterly audits. Normally, they go over very well and quickly and we have no issues. But, when we do have issues, we write them down as Datasheets to be resolved at some point by the team that screwed up. Often times it's as simple as ""Hey you guys have a new procedure, but you didn't update any of your SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), can you please do that?"" Or ""Hey, there was a massive re-org of your team, update that."" And the worst offender being ""Everyone's training is late, please get everyone up to date"".

However, 1 such team that another team member of mine deals with, is definitely seen as the main Problem Child when it comes to these Datasheets. It's worse than pulling teeth with them to get them to reply and even update us on what is going on with their progress. And 1 person in particular, is an absolute Cee U Next Tuesday and causes more issues than he's worth; I'll call him Neckbeard, because if you recall the South Park WoW episode, he is THAT Neckbeard guy. Don't know his age, but it's close to our age for sure. This is where the petty revenge starts.

G would often go over there to see how she could help that team with work and audits coming up, and also because one of the guys on the team was a friend of her's, outside of being friendly to each other at work, they text each other quite a bit. I had met him too when he came over for birthday cake I made for G and thought he was pretty cool as well. This one day, G went over to see if she could help with their progress on the 7 Datasheets this team has against them and brought Halloween candy with her that we keep in a cauldron I brought in (I'm one of the office Goths/Witches, lol).

Upon entering their small lab area across the hall from us, the whole Problem team grabs some of the candy, and when G turns to the Neckbeard and asks ""Any chance I could help you with those Datasheets?"", Neckbeard literally WAVES HER OFF and says ""Be gone."" The entire team, plus G's friend, LAUGH at her, so she thinks Neckbeard is kidding at first and kinda nervously laughs with them; but then they laugh harder.

G stops and looks at Neckbeard and says ""Wait, you're serious?"" To which he replies ""Yeah, I don't need your fucking help, I know everyone has been breathing down my neck about these things. So be gone, you're dismissed."" Still waving his hand dismissively at her.

She comes back to our cube, tells me the whole exchange with a fed up look on her face, and begins to gather her things so she can head home for the day and continue work from there. To say that I became overcome with Mama Bear rage is an understatement. But, this is where Neckbeard fucked up. Because, you see, I was put in charge of tracking the Datasheets progress and sending out weekly emails informing not only the teams responsible for them, but their supervisors and managers as well. And Neckbeard's Datasheets are going to be 2 years late come the 1st quarter of the new year (2025).

And because of my tracking sheet, our new manager has been incredibly happy with the new communication between all the teams that have Datasheets against them. And apparently Neckbeard lied to our manager in saying that he was almost done with the Datasheets, and he said he was in active communication with the QA team about them. 

So, I calmed down, I sought out our QA Lead and updated him of the situation, and then I went to our supervisor. Our supervisor, JUST came out of a meeting about the Problem Team and their outstanding Datasheets, so when he saw the look of hate and discontent on my face, he knew something was wrong. So, he then started a new email to our manager and the Problem Team's supervisor to let them know what just happened. Oh, and G's friend that also laughed at her? He must have figured out that he fucked up, because he swung by shortly after the incident and asked if she was still in office. I just smiled at him and said ""No, she left""; and he cursed under his breath and took off back towards the lab.

That was about end of last week, that this occurred. And my update on what is going to happen to Neckbeard is satisfying, to me at least. Now, if you work where I do, it's known that you're allowed to work from home, so long as you can be contacted and you get your shit done when it's due. I go in 3 days a week just to give myself a break from being at home. My Lead informed me, that the Problem Team's work from home privileges are being entirely revoked, they MUST be in during certain hours of the day (which is another slap in the face, cuz we can log in whenever we please), and any PTO they had planned is now being rejected and they're all being written up. This will also probably fuck with any future raises they may get.

I feel like I'm dying,"I'm just wondering for those of the people here who was diagnosed with chronic gastritis, do you ever feel fine for years after diagnosis and then experience a flare up again?

I believe I'm experiencing a flare up, or if not, maybe cancer or ulcer üò≠. I was diagnosed five years ago, and I feel fine for about three years, close to four years. I could even take spicy food and coffee without any symptoms.

But early this year, I started having trapped gas kinda of feel in my upper left abdomen. There'll be so much gas and I believes that's what making my stomach gurgle so loudly when I belly breath. And recently, I started having what I believe should be indigestion. There be a burning sensation at my epigastric area and perhaps it's the trapped gas that's making me feeling so full even tho I'm hungry. There's definitely some sort of loss of appetite. 

I don't really understand the definition of chronic gastritis tbh. Does it means that the gastritis symptoms will be there forever 24/7 or does it means that the lining of the stomach is inflamed over time and that we could experience flare up from time to time? 

I really hope that all the symptoms that I'm having is just gastritis and not ulcer or any cancer. I hoping to get another gastroscopy done soon but tbh I'm so so afraid of going under sedation and fear the lack of control. ",2,1729088111.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

This morning I tried ordering an iced chai with pumpkin foam, but asked if I could make the foam with just heavy cream instead of sweet cream. The barista at first ignored my request, just repeated my order back to me saying ""ok, an iced chai with pumpkin foam, anything else?"" I then asked again if I could have the foam made with heavy cream instead of sweet cream. I prefer the foam this way because I think the consistency of just heavy cream sits on top of the drink better. I also know the sweet cream has vanilla syrup in it, and I just don't want that extra bit of sugar. She told me ""oh, we can't do that that's against our policy"". I was a bit taken aback, because I am a former partner, I was promoted to customer in 2022. I remember making customized foams for customers all the time! There was one customer we had who'd order a tall iced coffee with 2% foam. I was also working in the height of the tik tok drink era so there were a million different foams I'd make often. We were even making the pumpkin foam before it was put on the menu! So after she told me it's against policy, I didn't want to be difficult so I just said ""oh, ok I guess that's fine"", and she then said ""yeah it just wouldn't foam up right"". And I said ""I don't mind how the heavy cream foams up, if that's alright"". I didn't think mentioning I was a former partner would have been helpful so I didn't mention it. I was alao just trying to be the least bit difficult as possible. She pretty much just told me no again, so I left it at that. I was the only car in line so I pull up to the window not even 10 seconds later, and the partner I talked to opens the window, as she's talking into the headset ( I can see she's talking to another partner only by the way the headset was flashing) and I heard her say ""...yeah but I don't want to do that"". She doesn't look at me when I pay or when she gives me my drink. I will have no idea if she was talking about my order on the headset or not, but I have a strong suspicion she was.

So I just want to ask, is making customized foams now against policy? I'm skeptical, especially with how my interaction went down today and the fact I heard her say what she said at the end there. Thanks for reading!",1,1729088011.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

Hi there ‚Äî 

I am desperate for help on these health issues that I‚Äôve been having and I feel I have tried everything under the sun to try and cure and heal myself, only to continue dealing with the same issues of impossible to lose belly fat, no periods, chin hair, and just generally not feeling that great. 

I have had so many blood tests, seen so many doctors, and the majority of my blood work has come back normal, and the most advice I‚Äôve gotten from doctors is to go on birth control or eat less than 1200 calories a day. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and pretty muscular, so that‚Äôs not in the cards for me‚Ä¶ and also pretty horrible medical advice? 

My most recent attempt at healing myself was seeing a nutritionist, after trying to figure out the right diet for myself for years, but I don‚Äôt feel like she was telling me anything I didn‚Äôt already know and she didn‚Äôt really have an issue with anything I was eating, she just wanted me to focus on eating blood sugar balancing meals, so balancing a carb with more protein. But I already generally eat like that and eat enough protein. 

The only time I‚Äôve had any luck losing weight was during Covid, when my stress levels were very very low and I was doing Crossfit 3 hours a day, 6 days a week with very close friends in our own little bubble. I was living with two close friends, felt very safe and comfortable at home, and enjoyed not having the pressure of regular life. I was also eating predominantly plant based and not focusing on protein at all, probably very high carb at the time. I lost 30 pounds easily, didn‚Äôt even notice or try, didn‚Äôt count calories. But eventually I gained it all back and the crossfit workouts stopped feeling good for my body, and I would leave the gym chronically fatigued and angry after a workout, which would have previously energized and de-stressed me. 

I grew up in a very stressful environment and have had a pretty stressful life overall with toxic workplaces and bad friendships that were mimicking the environment I grew up in or were created because I let people walk all over me. I had a good amount of emotional and verbal abuse and manipulation from a narcissistic mother and grandmother, that trickled down into other relationships in my family. I‚Äôve done A LOT of therapy and I feel I am in a good place with all of this at least consciously and mentally, but I have read that this type of childhood can lead to PCOS later in life so not sure if that‚Äôs still playing out in the background and I feel overwhelmed about what to do about it if it is. 

To give more context, here are all of the health issues I‚Äôve been dealing with: 

I feel pretty stressed out often and I can‚Äôt sit still and can‚Äôt relax until my to-do list is done, but often by the time it‚Äôs done I‚Äôve exhausted myself and I‚Äôm tired but wired. 

Extremely sensitive to caffeine, coffee makes me feel sick and gives me migraines, matcha sometimes makes me shit my pants or have a really upset stomach and loose stools.

Highly sugary foods, like Skittles, make my heart race and my face flush. 

Don‚Äôt get a period unless I take a progesterone only pill to trigger it (take it 10 days out of the month and 1-2 days after I stop taking it, I get my period), but I get an actual period when I take the pill, not a withdrawal bleed. I get cramps and bloating and all of the typical symptoms of an actual period. Period has always been irregular since I first got it at 12. 

Intermittent painful bloating and digestive issues that seems to come on randomly, not from specific foods or periods of time. Sometimes gluten is a trigger, sometimes it‚Äôs not. Fiber makes me extremely bloated. Stomach issues sometimes resolve with an extra strength IBS level probiotic (450 billion), but not always. Bloating and digestive issues definitely get worse with stress. 

Chin hairs, light happy trail on belly. 

Impossible to lose belly fat and love handles, no matter what I do, how little I eat, what I eat, what supplements I‚Äôve taken, etc. I primarily hold fat in my belly and love handles, and slightly in my underarms/armpits, and maybe a bit in my upper back, but I am generally pretty apple shaped, but my stomach isn‚Äôt round it‚Äôs kind of a { shape. 

I‚Äôve had so much bloodwork done, including glucose tests, cortisol urine, blood, and saliva tests, hormone tests. Glucose and cortisol came back normal, but I did have elevated testosterone, low DHEA, and low luteneizing hormone. 

I eat very healthy, whole food focused, and don‚Äôt over eat often. I‚Äôve tried vegan/plant-based, keto, low-carb high protein, no sugar, no dairy, no gluten, paleo, cutting calories, etc. Nothing worked. When I lost weight during Covid I was eating predominantly plant-based minimal processed and was not counting calories at all. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with chronic plantar fasciitis, tight stiff back pain, weak hips, knee and ankle pain. I saw a PT for a while, and she helped a lot with the hip pain which helped with the other pain too. I have to wear intense arch supports in my shoes to stop my high arches from collapsing when I‚Äôm walking, which often leads to the pain I mentioned. 

I have very clear, glowy skin and don‚Äôt really ever get pimples or acne. I have had those bumps on the back of my arms and sometimes I get light bumps on my forehead. The bumps on the back of my arms went away permanently after I got a lymphatic massage and the masseuse dry brushed me. The bumps on my forehead go away with a light BHA formula. 

I got a PCOS diagnosis when I was 16 and they confirmed that I had cysts on my ovaries with an ultrasound, but they haven‚Äôt done one since and I‚Äôm 30 now. 

Historically have gotten sick very easily, but that‚Äôs calmed down and now I get sick only 2-3 times a year. 

Don‚Äôt really have trouble falling asleep, but I often wake up at 3am and have trouble falling back asleep, and sometimes have trouble staying asleep and will wake up fairly early, like 2 hours before I should and won‚Äôt be able to get back to sleep. Magnesium and weed help with this for the most part, but not always. 

Exercise beyond walking can stress me out and make me feel very activated. I went to the gym the other night and did a very light weights workout, but again I left the gym feeling really activated and stressed out, not relaxed nor happy. And I could barely fall asleep that night. Generally I walk for about 1-2 hours a day with my dog just around the neighborhood (we live in a quiet part of Boston with a lovely community) and I started incorporating wearing a 20lb weighted vest to those walks. It‚Äôs also been almost a year since I stopped doing CrossFit.

Pretty healthy bowel movements. I poop 2-3 times a day, and usually it feels firm/well-formed/normal, but the last couple of months or so I‚Äôve had really bad upset stomach a few times and have actually just shit myself a couple of times because I lost complete control of my bowels for whatever reason and couldn‚Äôt hold it in any longer. Both times were after I had a whole milk iced matcha latte with a little sweetener and on hot days when I walked 20+ minutes and one was after doing a brutal hot yoga class, so thought maybe it was heat stroke. Have since stopped drinking those and taking those classes.

Often get cravings for candy, and sometimes salty things, or both at the same time. But sometimes I get no cravings at all and I can go without this type of stuff for a while. 

I have tried every PCOS related supplement under the sun and nothing has really seemed to make much of a difference. Progesterone and spironolactone helped reduce the chin hair and induce periods, but it didn‚Äôt really do much otherwise. I‚Äôve tried birth control and had really awful reactions to it, gained 30 pounds and my emotions were insane. I‚Äôve tried an anti-depressant, but it was so activating it made my anxiety ten times worse. I tried Lexapro, but it made me gain weight and it just masked my stress symptoms, but the stress was still there. 

I get weird stomach pains sometimes. Like if I lie down too soon after eating or eat while I‚Äôm laying down (like snacking while watching tv laying on the couch), if I got to stand up my stomach will be extremely painful and it will feel like everything in my stomach is shifting in the wrong direction and it only goes away if I lie down again. 

I‚Äôve also been dealing with some back pain and a very tight back, but I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until I got a deep tissue massage and it was so painful I was crying on the table and had to ask the masseuse to take a break multiple times. He said my back was extremely tight and I had a ton of knots. That was a few weeks ago, but recently my boyfriend lightly poked at my back while I was lying down and I yelped because it was so painful just to be lightly poked! 

If anyone has any insight into what might going on with me or recommendations on doctors see and tests I should get, please send them my way!
