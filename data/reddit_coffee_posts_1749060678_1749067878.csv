1l3fp7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3fp7y/a_job_i_did_for_a_healthcare_company/,A job I did for a healthcare company,"At the shop this morning we had the regular faces. I was early for once. That's because we were working on my first job I had been assigned as a foreman. 

Laz Healthcare was the hardest job I have encountered so far. It's not like I haven't had good help either. Turd was banned from the site the first hour he was there. Something about “wandering into the lab or some shit”. They said he was muttering and trying to break down the door. I had Lou pick him up immediately. Ever since I've had Zeke and Izzy. They're smart guys, but they're green. The whole job is to install some new bathrooms and the some acid piping for the new lab. 

Bill told me the job should take 5 weeks. After looking at the plans, I figured I could get it done in 3. Oh how I was wrong. It was Friday on the third week and we weren't even close to making the 5 week deadline. I have a tailgate meeting every morning to discuss site safety and what jobs the boys and I will be doing today. 

“Zeke, Izzy, come here. We’re making a game plan for today.” 

“Lemme guess, drill more holes?” said Zeke

“Yea,” I responded exhaustedly. 

“Tefucinhelaralltheezgonefer,” said Izzy 

“The holes are for the piping Izzy. I'm trying to run it as fast as you’re drilling them. How many are we at Zeke?” 

“313”

“How many do you have left abouts?” 

“Teneac,” said Izzy 

“Figure we can get those 20 done today?” 

“We’d be pushing hard at that rate. It is about an hour a hole in some places.”

“Do the best you can.” 

“Ferckinryin” 

“I know Izzy, I was hoping to have the job completed this week.” 

After that brief tailgate meeting, the boys had their jobs and I had mine. The day proceeded as normal. I went to where I was working and set my radio up. I go a bit crazy if I don't have something playing in the background on my jobsites. Today I was listening to these two guys yap away about scary stories they've read. I like these two. One is some kid from Appalachia, you know what they say about people from Appalachia, and the other is some old dude who's got a kickass neckbeard according to the kid. They spend hours yammering on about spooky shit. However, the noise they make helps me concentrate. 

I continued working and at lunch break I asked the boys to give me a progress update. 

“Zeke, how we doing?”

“Way we’re going today, we may just hit that deadline,” Zeke said enthusiastically. 

“Gotreelef, ezegerttoo,” said Izzy.

“Make’s 5, we’ll see if we're lucky by the end of the day.” 

We, in fact, we’re not lucky. Zeke did fine with his final 2 holes, Izzy however…

“FERCKINPICEOFERCKINSHIET!” 

*a sound of something heavy and expensive hitting a wall then proceeding to fall to the floor* 

“IZ! The fuck are you doing?” I shouted 

“TISFERCKINOLESFERCKINWENTIFERVFERCKINFETTICK! TEFERCK, TELESTFERCKINOLE! FERCKTISFERCKINTUPIDFERCKINJHOB!”

“Walls only supposed to be a foot thick Izzy, did you mark it where it supposed to be on the plan? You could’ve hit a structural column?”

“UMERKDTEOLE! DONNTFERCKINAYEYEFERCKINRILLEDTEFERCKINOLE!”

“Well, I’ve been wrong before Izzy, I can be wrong again. Let’s go check on the plans and have a coffee,” I said calmly.

 Izzy muttered under his breath angrily as we went to my makeshift on-site office.

“Look Izzy, there’s a column right next to where you’re drilling, guess it was just a little bigger than the plans said. I fucked up buddy, I’m sorry I tried to blame you.”

“Isnotyeristeferckinjhob, iferckinateferckinbeinher.”

“Do you hate your career? Buddy you’ve been doing this for 3 years with us. I thought you loved it?”

“Iontferckinateeingaferckinlumber, Iferckinatedisferckinjhob, isgivinmeighmars” said Izzy frustratedly.

“Yea, I hear you Izzy. It’s getting to me too. I’ve found myself waking up with a cold sweat or two about this job lately,” I said exhaustedly. 

“Isyerirstjhobyergertnerosses,” said Izzy concernedly.

“Don’t remind me, I’ve wanted to call Bill, Bob or Lou and ask what the fuck to do on a few occasions,” I laughed. 

“Disjhobiskillinus.”

Izzy’s comment hung in the air as we walked quietly to where Zeke was. He had heard the commotion Izzy had made and must’ve tidied things up while we were checking the plans. 

“Well Zeke, thanks for cleaning up. I’ve gotta check that location I marked for Izzy. Seems like I fucked up.” 

I checked the location of the hole. 

“There’s not supposed to be a support here,” I said as Zeke looked into the hole.

“This sure looks like a support.”

“Well throw the last extension on the drill and we’ll see if Lou can talk his way outta repairing it if I'm wrong.” 

Izzy did as I asked and almost immediately went through.

“Guess we are lucky today,” I said to the two. 

Zeke looked into the final hole.

“Why’s it dark? Should be through to the other side, right?”

I walked into the room we were drilling into. The lights were on, but no hole. 

“Where the hell is that going? Izzy can you push further into the hole?” 

Izzy did as I asked. 

“Asferasshellger,” said Izzy 

He was in about four feet. The specs on the supports say they're solid all the way through and three feet thick.

“Zeke grab me a length of pipe.”

“Twelve foot piece or twenty-one?” 

“Twenty-one.” 

He brought the length over and I pushed into the hole. We were able to slide the entire length in. 
Puzzled, I stepped back to assess the situation. 

“Pull the pipe out Zeke. I have a feeling we’ll have to drill a new hole.” 

Zeke pulled the pipe, but it didn’t move. Suddenly the pipe jerked Zeke towards the hole. He let go and the pipe vanished. 

“Teferck?” Said Izzy. 

Astonished at what we’d just witnessed, I spoke up. 

“We still need to go through that wall, I guess drill it lower?,” I said with a tone lacking confidence. 

So Zeke mounted the drill back up and drilled another hole. Before I could get going on what I was working on, I heard Zeke shouting for me. I walked briskly back to where he was working. He was through, but we still had the same problem. There was a hole too somewhere but not where we needed to go. Finally, I had enough and grabbed my flashlight to take a look through the holes to see if I was missing something. 

“What do you see up there boss,” said Zeke. 

“It’s a massive room about 40ft deep by 60ft wide, it looks like a laboratory,” I said. 

I thought in my head if we actually drilled through the labs walls but there’s no way I had, it was a hundred feet in the other direction and plus I’d seen the interior of that lab, it was completely different. 

I shined my light through the hole to the centre of the room. It’s light reflected of 7 massive glass tank. 

“Holy shit! It looks like a sci-fi movie. There’s tanks that look like you could float…,” I trailed off. 

It was then I noticed there were things floating in the tanks. They’re were small, barely noticeable in the liquid filling the tanks. Only 4 of the tanks were full. 3 of them contained what looked to be masses of cells, though the 4th explained why the looked that way. It was a baby. It was curled in a ball. I thought it wasn’t developed enough but I noticed it was missing a hand. 

Under all the tanks was a nameplate. It appeared the first empty three were:

L04WR

L04GR

L04EN

The last 4 were

L04GL

L04SL

L04LU

L04PR

It was the oddest scene. I couldn’t describe it to my apprentices, that’s why I told them to look. 

“Guys you have to see this,” I said. 

Both Izzy and Zeke climbed the ladder and looked into the holes. 

Neither saw what I had.

1l3fowd,https://i.redd.it/pf2z9r6gwy4f1.jpeg,I feel like I don't like my friends enough,"I had one friend who would've done almost anything for me and I just let our friendship fizzle out after he moved. He moved like half an hour by public transport away. And I always felt a little annoyed listening to him. I really appreciate what he did and I know he's a good person but I just couldn't be bothered. 

Another friend moved like 10 minutes away (we were all roommates at one point). It's been like 3 months and I haven't met him since, we messaged once because he reached out. I did say that it'd be nice to do something together again but we've never made specific plans. 

Now I'm regularly meeting this old lady. She's an alternative practitioner but she really knows her stuff. I've been in therapy a lot (currently on another waiting list) and what we do is basically the same. She's super nice. She charges other people but she doesn't charge me because she wants me to get better. She also often invites for ice cream or coffee for these sessions. I kinda feel that what we're doing is working. But I feel bad because I notice that she really cares about me but I don't care about her at all.

I don't think I have anyone in my life that I actually like. I think they're nice but that's it.

1l3fos8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1l3fos8/just_happened_at_the_bookstore/,Just happened at the bookstore,"I was at the mall bookstore, and made my first stop the bathroom.  I'm in the stall and hear someone outside say in a loud, chipper voice ""Erica, that's really loud.  Can you turn it down?"".  Now, there was zero noise in the bathroom, but I didn't think anything about it.  I come out, and there's a woman washing her hands.  She's nicely dressed, hair and makeup.  She finishes washing her hands, then sort of stares up to the corner of the bathroom and says ""Sarah, people are working, that's too loud.""

Now, she had that sort of polite, high pitched, enunciated voice that everyone uses as their customer service voice, so I assume she's working there and is talking on an earpiece walkie talkie.  She steps aside, I start to wash my hands and she just sort of goes and stands in the doorway, staring off into space for a moment with a little smile.  As I turn to leave she says ""Maddie, you need to turn it down."" She's not looking at me, but is blocking my way and not making any attempt to move. As I shuffle around her, I realize she has no earpiece in.  Evidently, she's just talking to herself

I start browsing, and a few minutes later she comes behind me, ""Dana, its too loud, you're bothering people who are working"".  I look over and she's just staring off with that little polite smile.  At this point, I make a point of trying to catch her eye, and when that doesn't work I just smile and say hi to her.  She doesn't answer.

For the next half hour, she followed me around the store, never talking to me, but just looking off from me and telling various women's names that something is too loud for a work area.  I tried engaging her in conversation twice, saying things like ""oh, do you need to see this section?"" but she ignored me.  Finally I went to the in store cafe and she stood by the line, repeating herself a few times.  I chatted with the barista who seemed to be equally confused by her.  By this point I figure I'm part of some weird prank so I'm looking around for someone recording, but no dice.

Finally I just left without buying anything other than my coffee, and when I got to my car I turned around and she is just standing outside the doors to the bookstore, staring off with a little smile towards nothing.

1l3foee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1l3foee/bass_modelers_worth_my_time/,Bass Modelers. Worth my time?,"So I have been playing bass for a quite a while, and my band is starting to get picked up a bit more often for gigs. The gigs we are playing are low volume: we have a small, low volume drum kit, acoustic guitar, and my guitar player and I both sing (more him than me). We are starting to get into a really good groove, and we get a lot of compliments on sounding good while not overpowering the farmer's markets, coffee shops, and events that we are playing.

Anyways, we've been running everything direct into a mixing board and the mixing board out to a powered speaker. We are, however, at a point where we need a slightly... MORE powered speaker, and I've bought one (a 300 watt, 10in Behringer if you must know, and it's replacing a Kustom monitor wedge that I think is something like 80 watts and has an 8in speaker). We probably really only need about 100 watts or a little north of there, but hey, I found an open box deal. Call it... headroom. Heh.

I've been using a small practice amp because realistically its 50 watts has been more than plenty. I am currently planning on ditching the amp and going straight into the board - which I have done a trial run of with our existing PA speaker, and it sounds just fine, just not QUITE loud enough.

That's where my question comes in: is it worth it to get an amp modeler? I'm playing 100% clean and simple, and I can dial in EQ well enough with the mixing board, my tone knob, and my fingers. I won't be using any distortion or any effects or anything. If I decided that I wanted compression, I have a compression pedal but I don't feel that I need it right now. I have a few other pedals too if I ever feel I want them.

1. what do _ and _ have in common: this started off easy for me, 2 and 7 are numbers, two animals, two instruments, then i got “what do push and clap have in common?” and i said they’re both force exerting movements LOL and the second one i got that stumped me was “what do friends and enemies have in common?” and i said they’re both a relationship to someone??? when she asked me to elaborate, i couldn’t lol i just clarified that someone could be a friend or an enemy to someone=a relationship/status to that person.

2. curious how everyone answered the picture book test. i found it really hard to be imaginative and found myself just narrating what i saw “the boy looked shocked or maybe he’s scared….now they’re walking somewhere and there are birds next to them”. we took turns with the pages and i was trying to somewhat copy her style of telling but think i fell flat lol 

3. she asked me to describe my friends, my family, and home, and i gave her very objective and maybe some subjective details “this person is kind, they work at a coffee shop, they studied school at __” “my apartment is on the second floor, 800 sq ft, etc” 

4. there were multiple times i didn’t know the answer to things like “what does this saying mean” or “define this word” and i would say i didn’t know and she would prompt me to make a guess and im just repeated i did not know and that was my answer lol i couldn’t come up with something on the spot.

I also think I have mild dysautonomia from my bacterial infection, but I've never been officially diagnosed. 

I'm in my late 30s and have had chronic constipation since I was young due to my cerebral palsy. I mostly use a power wheelchair now. Constipation is very common with cerebral palsy. Recently, it's gotten much worse, even though I've increased my water intake, take Lactulose (laxative), and eat prunes. I'm unable to drink coffee anymore because of my GERD. 

I guess I never thought about the possibility of GERD and chronic constipation being chronic illnesses. Both do affect my life daily, though. So, are they? 

I also have a history of chronic Candida from being on antibiotics from 2018 to 2020 due to my infected rods and surgeries in 2017-2018. My Candida infection lasted from 2018 to 2022 and drastically affected my health. It gave me brain fog, fatigue, gut dysbiosis, and more, and only went away after being on a strict antifungal protocol of two alternating antifungal medications. Not even the anti-Candida diet alone was enough to eliminate it. I've been on high-quality probiotics for a long time and it still wasn't enough until I got the antifungal treatment. So I was wondering, if that was considered a chronic illness as well, even though it went away. Because I am actually more susceptible to future Candida infections now.

1l3fgbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1l3fgbb/letter_for_why_i_left/,Letter for Why I Left,"I created the following letter to share my journey with friends and family members who asked why I left the Church. I have not shared it with anyone yet. Full disclosure: It's long but I would love feedback if any of the details (historical/doctrinal) are inaccurate. I also plan to include this when I have my records removed this year.  
  
To Whom it May Concern-  
  
I’ve found that Church members rarely want to hear the details of why someone leaves the organization—or they assume they already know the reasons, often saying, “all the people who leave have the same story.” I don’t believe my story is unique, but I’ve found it therapeutic to write about my journey. And if someone is curious enough to read this, perhaps it will help them better understand why I chose to leave an institution I was so deeply invested in. I served in bishoprics, completed a two-year mission—spending the final six months as an assistant to the president—spent years participating in ward councils in various capacities, and attended the temple once per week. For a long time, I set aside my doubts to avoid disappointing my family and friends, most of whom remain active in the Church. A common script I heard when I was active in the Church was, “people leave to take the easy way out.” I can assure you that no part of (1) Accepting the truth about something that was near and dear to my heart, (2) disappointing family, friends, and fellow church members, and (3) the massive strain on a marriage this deconstruction places on someone you love, is easy. Having studied the scriptures, conference talks, and being deeply ingrained in this culture for many years, I assure you, no one was more disappointed than I to come to this realization.

I am also well aware that the Church creates a lot of fear around information from “unapproved sources” and I am in fact an unapproved source. 

A common analogy for leaving is that when something (a doctrine, a policy, a fact of history) troubles us, we place it on a shelf, hoping that someday we’ll find an answer. But eventually, for some of us, that shelf gets too heavy—and it breaks. The associated cognitive dissonance eventually forces action. So here are the items that broke my shelf and caused everything to come apart. 

Shelf Item #1

I’ve always struggled with the idea of “one true church.” Even during my mission, it felt oddly small-minded and arrogant to believe that our relatively tiny organization of 15 million people possessed the only complete truth—especially when almost every human being who’s ever lived has likely uttered some version of the plea, “God, show me the way.” Yet people arrive at vastly different conclusions: some become atheists, others Buddhists, shamans, Catholics, Muslims, or adopt countless other belief systems and phillosophies. It seems improbable that a loving God would make discovering “the truth” so technical and elusive that billions of sincere seekers throughout history would end up with conflicting beliefs.

Today, with the Church losing members and estimated active participation down to around 5 million or less, it’s even harder for me to believe that a loving Heavenly Father would allow the vast majority of His children to be misled. The story of the Prophet Muhammad is strikingly similar to that of Joseph Smith—yet these two men, both claiming divine revelation, produced radically different doctrines and organizations. Are we to believe that one was inspired by God and the other deceived by the devil, even if both were sincere in their seeking? Especially when historical evidence suggests that Joseph Smith was often deceptive, manipulative, and narcissistic throughout his life (more on that later), he hardly seems the worthy vessel for the full restoration the Church gives him credit for.

It seems far-fetched that, between these two figures, God would grant one the full truth and the other just a fragment—particularly given that Islam, the faith founded by Muhammad, has grown to over 2 billion adherents, while Mormonism remains relatively small at 17 million, most of whom are not active. If God’s priority were truly to spread “the truth” to the greatest number of His children, Islam appears, by any measure, to be far ahead.

Shelf Item #2One thing that always stood out to me—even as a teenager reading the *Book of Mormon*—was how frequently Jesus Christ is mentioned, long before His earthly life. The text, which is supposedly set on the opposite side of the world centuries before His birth, refers to Him by name as early as the book of *Jacob*. Even more striking is the presence of distinctly evangelical Christian themes throughout—a form of Christianity that didn’t emerge until the 18th century and was especially prominent during Joseph Smith’s lifetime. Evangelical Christianity, rooted in the Protestant Reformation and shaped by figures like Martin Luther, William Tyndale, and other reformers, was a theological development that evolved well after the life of Christ. Its ideas simply wouldn’t have existed in the pre-Christian era described in the *Book of Mormon*.  
  


Examples Include:

1. Born-Again Language and Personal Salvation

* Evangelical Christianity emphasizes being ""born again""—a personal conversion experience as the foundation of salvation.
* Book of Mormon Parallel:
   * *Alma 5:14*: ""Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances?""
   * *Mosiah 27:25*: “And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind... must be born again.”
* These verses use terminology that mirrors 18th- and 19th-century revivalist language more than ancient Hebrew or early Christian ideas.

2. Sola Fide (Salvation by Faith Alone)

* A core Protestant and evangelical belief is that salvation comes by faith, not by works—*sola fide*.
* Book of Mormon Parallel:  
   * *2 Nephi 25:23*: ""...for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.""
   * While this verse attempts to balance grace and effort, the emphasis on grace and salvation by Christ's merits echoes Protestant views more than the works-based theology of ancient Judaism.

3. Direct, Personal Relationship with Jesus

* Evangelicalism teaches that individuals can have a direct, personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
* Book of Mormon Parallel:
   * *Enos 1:4-6*: Enos prays fervently and receives a personal forgiveness from God.
   * *3 Nephi 11–27*: The resurrected Jesus appears directly to the Nephites and teaches them much of the same doctrine found in the New Testament.
* These personal interactions with Christ and a focus on emotional conversion are hallmark features of evangelical revivalism.

4. Preaching of Christ’s Name Centuries Before His Birth

* Book of Mormon Example:
   * *2 Nephi 10:3*: “Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ—for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name—should come among the Jews…”
   * The use of the Greek-derived word “Christ” (not “Messiah”) before the time of Jesus, in a non-Hellenistic culture, is both theologically and linguistically anachronistic.

5. Altar Calls and Revivalist Preaching Styles

* Many sermons in the *Book of Mormon* resemble 19th-century revival preaching in tone and structure.
* Example: Alma 5 – Alma asks a series of soul-searching, emotional questions to stir personal repentance—much like a revivalist preacher would.
   * “Can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you…?” (Alma 5:16)
* The emotional appeal and direct challenge to repent resemble tent revival sermons common in Joseph Smith’s America.

6. Doctrine of the Trinity as Understood in 19th-Century Protestantism

* Book of Mormon Example:  
   * *Mosiah 15:1–5*: “God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.”
   * Early Book of Mormon passages often blur the line between the Father and the Son, resembling modalism or simplified Trinitarianism found in some Protestant preaching.

7. Bible-Quoting Culture and King James Language

* The *Book of Mormon* mirrors the King James Bible in tone, syntax, and even entire passages, aligning with the Bible-saturated culture of 19th-century Protestant America.
* It even quotes from New Testament passages (e.g., *3 Nephi 12–14* reproduces the Sermon on the Mount almost verbatim).

8. King Benjamin’s Sermon

* “And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons and his daughter.” (verse 7)
* “I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ…” (verse 8)

Shelf Item #4

Plagiarism of the New Testament in the Book of Mormon. I often wondered while studying the Book of Mormon, how the nearly exact verses in the New Testament found their way into the Book of Mormon, many years before the New Testament came into existence. Particular language and ideas aligned with Pauline doctrines. The New Testament as we know it, did not come into existence until after 1066 or even later. And the verses in the Gospels themselves were not written until 70+ years after the death of Christ, making it difficult to justify the Book of Mormon’s historicity and [timeline.Direct](http://timeline.Direct) Parallels Between the Book of Mormon and the New Testament

1. The Sermon on the Mount

Shelf Item #5The Doctrine and Covenants. Each time I read the Doctrine and Covenants, I couldn’t help but notice the manipulative language used by Joseph to get what he wanted. The most prominent example being Section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants where “God” condemns Emma if she doesn’t accept Joseph’s other wives as his property (more on polygamy later). But the idea of a loving God condemning a woman who only recently discovered her husbands infidelity–it is known that Joseph slept with a number of his wives over the six years preceding this “revelation”–is more conducive to narcissistic manipulation than revelation. This is but one example. There are countless other examples of Joseph sending men on missions and marrying their wives while they were away. The God I was raised with would never have approved such actions.Shelf Item #6The Book of Abraham. There is perhaps no greater evidence of Joseph Smith’s Fraud than this. A script of Papyrus he got his hands on and expounded on as the Book of Abraham, but these images are known to be common funeral texts, easily translated by Egyptolygists. Unfortunately these are not only damning, but also humorous, as the image Joseph Smith cited as being Heavenly Father on his throne (Image 7), is actually the Egyptian God of fertility, and this Egyptian God has a massive erection. Perhaps this was the beginning of Joseph's “revelation” on polygamy/the new and everlasting covenant.

Shelf Item #7

Lying, Cheating, and Stealing. One of the things most difficult to come to terms with is that the organization that provided opportunities to serve others and be part of an incredible community, violates many of the founding moral principles it teaches.

* Lying - Church historians have known for many years that Joseph Smith never used a Urim and Thummim–at least not how it was described in the bible. Even though Russell M. Nelson spoke about the translation process being done by looking at a rock in a hat in the early 90’s, Church marketing materials continued to depict Joseph looking at the gold plates well into the early 2000’s (see the 2006 image below). Dr. Richard Bushman is one of the foremost experts on Joseph Smith still active in the church, and he confirms that the process of translation did not in fact include looking at the plates at all, and he isn’t sure what role they played or why they needed to be in the room at all when Joseph was just looking at a rock in a hat. It is deceptive to in any way shape or form use the term translation, as the word itself denotes changing a text from one language to another. It has also kept quiet the fact that Joseph’s account of his first vision changes drastically depending on the account you read, and only published the one which aligns best with the long term theology they have adopted. It also fails to take accountability for the fact that Richard Bushman later confirmed–Joseph believed he was the final prophet before the second coming of Christ. A point the Church still keeps quiet. There are more but another standout is that much of the non-mormon neighbors of the early Saints were unsettled by the fact that Joseph was setting himself up to be the “King of Zion” and they felt it was a threat to democracy. This was one of many reasons mobs and militias rose up against the early Saints.

* Cheating - Some might think this far fetched but through much investigation and interviewing people internally at Church Headquarters and Ensign Peak Investments, The Securities and Exchanges Commission discovered attempts to hide earnings across shell corporations and changing tax filings. And only after this SEC violation did the Church begin ramping up their own philanthropic efforts, being in the 10’s of millions range rather than the Billions.
* Stealing - On my mission we frequently taught the blessings of paying tithing. We most frequently taught these to the poor and needy who were barely getting by without paying the extra 10%. After learning about the Church’s holdings equating to over $250 Billion in the United States, and potentially over $1 Trillion worldwide, it is difficult to understand why the impoverished must pay into such a fund. Now I recognize that the contributions from these poor people make up a relatively small portion of the Churches overall assets, but that makes it all the more damning.

In 2019, I began reading *Saints*, the recently released, Church-approved history of the LDS Church. While driving across Missouri for work meetings, I listened to the audiobook and was stunned by the Church’s open acknowledgment of things I had long been told were “anti-Mormon lies.” These included Joseph Smith’s secret practice of polygamy—publicly preaching monogamy while privately engaging in polygamy and even polyandry—his early use of a seer stone to hunt for buried treasure, and later using that same stone to “translate” the Book of Mormon. It also detailed his talent from a young age for telling elaborate stories about Native American culture. That experience reshaped my understanding: there was no such thing as “anti-Mormon” material—only documented history. Yet *Saints* continued paint a favorable version of history rather than the unfettered truth. It attempted to justify Joseph’s lies to Emma and his own brother Hyrum, it failed to admit that Joseph Smith Sr. was an alcoholic, and the men in the Church often drank together (Porter Rockwell owned a saloon in Salt Lake City).

Shelf Item #9

Wealth Practices of the Church. As I younger man, I used to marvel at the Church’s immense resources. Thinking that if the second coming happened, we would be well prepared (much of this being placed in my mind by priesthood leaders and family members). Later I realized what happens to stocks during economic downturns, and realized that these resources would be of little to no worth. 

Shelf Item #10Polygamy and Polyandry. While there is much discrepancy as to how many wives Joseph had, whether or not he had children with these women, and dates of actual practice. Two things stand out. First, that all sources confirm he practiced polygamy–both in and out of the church, and two, that he kept this polygamy quiet from Emma. Jacob 2 tells us that the only purpose of polygamy is to “raise up righteous seed,” yet if the Church is correct in it’s assumption that he had no children with his polygamous wives, what would be it’s purpose other than pleasure? And if he did have children with these women, they have clearly kept that under wraps. Regardless of how you draw the line, the “approved source” of information, appears to be unsure about justifying Joseph’s behavior here.

Shelf Item #11  
Murder in the name of God. Two well-documented stand outs of this in the early days of the church are:  
  
1. Porter Rockwells attempting to murder Governor Boggs on Joseph Smith’s order. One of likely many errands that early prophets sent Porter on.

2. The Mountain Meadows Massacre. This is not only one of the darkest events of Church History, but one of the darkest events in American History, and the Church made attempts to cover it up for years. Threatening any members who wrote about the event with excommunication. Fortunately people like Juanita Brookes were brave enough to release it anyways.

Shelf Item #12  
Hiding sexual abuse charges to protect the name of the chuch. This could be an entire letter on its own–as could much of the above, but here are some brief examples:

1. AP Investigation (2022) – Arizona Case

One of the most high-profile investigations was reported by *The Associated Press* in August 2022. It involved:

* A bishop in Arizona who learned in 2011 that a church member was abusing his daughters.
* The bishop reported it to the Church’s “help line”, which routed the situation to lawyers for the Church, not law enforcement.
* As a result, the abuse continued for several more years, even producing video evidence uploaded by the perpetrator to the dark web.
* The Church claimed clergy-penitent privilege protected the bishop from reporting the abuse.

Key issue: The Church allegedly used the help line as a legal shield, prioritizing institutional liability over victim protection.

2. LDS Help Line – A Legal Tool?

The “help line”, created in the 1990s and operated by Kirton McConkie, the Church’s law firm, is ostensibly to help bishops navigate abuse disclosures. However:

* Critics argue it has been used to manage risk for the Church more than protect victims.
* Calls to the helpline often don’t result in law enforcement notification, particularly in states with clergy-penitent privilege laws.

3. West Virginia Lawsuit (2018)

* A lawsuit claimed church leaders covered up abuse by a stake high councilman in Martinsburg, West Virginia.
* The suit alleged the Church discouraged the victim’s family from going to the police, and transferred the abuser rather than reporting him.

The Church denied wrongdoing, but the case raised national attention regarding how the Church handles abuse internally.

4. Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Connection

The LDS Church was one of the largest sponsors of Boy Scout troops, and many sexual abuse claims in the BSA bankruptcy proceedings involve LDS-affiliated troops.

* Thousands of abuse claims have implicated church leaders who allegedly failed to report abuse or protect youth under their care.
* The Church was named in hundreds of lawsuits stemming from those allegations.

5. Culture of Silence

Many former members and abuse survivors have described:

* A cultural and doctrinal emphasis on protecting the Church’s reputation.
* Discouragement from reporting abuse, especially if the perpetrator was a respected member or leader.
* Shaming or disbelieving victims, particularly if their claims threatened a male priesthood holder’s standing.

Lay Clergy. Throughout my childhood I was repeatedly taught about the nobility of free service given by people of the Church. However, only those at a local level give free service. General Authorities and Mission Presidents are given healthy 6-figure stipends in order to serve, while missionaries survive on meager allotments each month. I survived on $135 per month in the state of California for two years which meant going without food most of the time, however, that was still pay.

The Church didn’t save me. In November of 2018, I sat in the basement of my home watching my 6-month old daughter play on the floor while my wife and older daughter were on a date. I was in a severe state of depression and had been for several months or more. Despite temple attendance, keeping the commandments, and active engagement in my calling in the Church, God didn’t give me this peace and I was even contemplating suicide. He wasn’t saving me. Eventually I found Stoicism and it proved to be my salvation in many ways. This letter isn’t about Stoicism but I will simply say, I found a richness in this philosophy that the Church lacked. A beauty in the simple reality and brutality of life. A beauty in embracing the struggle, and my own worth as a person living at this moment in time. Even though I fall far short of living this philosophy, it continues to give me hope and inspiration and a healthier view of self than I had previously.

Conclusion

Fast forward a year and some change after officially making the decision to separate myself from the Church. I’ve found that while I’ve chosen to take the harder path, it is in fact, more peaceful. I find myself more aligned with humanity and the facts of life. Not that I am without fault or flaw, but each mistake doesn’t weigh nearly as heavily as it used to. I can still be arrogant, and narcissistic at times, and I still really suck at relationships a lot of the time.It’s said that when a soldier going on a suicide mission is preparing for their final days, they notice and savor everything. Each and every moment. I am not a soldier. I am not noble, nor heroic, but perhaps the greatest gift from leaving the Church has been savoring the sweetest parts of life. Embracing my small children and reading stories to them at night, riding a good horse, a mountain breeze as it comes through the pines or quakies, the taste of a good cup of coffee or a small glass of whiskey, the colors of the sky as the sun sets behind the mountains. I’ve always appreciated these things but they are somehow sweeter now. More vibrant. Eat, drink, and be merry no longer carries a negative connotation to me but a short sermon on the brevity of life and that heaven is found here, probably not somewhere else.   
  
I see the life I have as more of a gift than ever. I have a love and appreciation for the time with my children that I didn’t have before. Maybe there is an afterlife, maybe there isn’t. I spent years trying to figure it out and the reality is, it just doesn’t matter that much. What I have control over is making the most of the life I have now. In squeezing every drop of joy and satisfaction out of every moment in time. In helping my children reach their potential and helping them understand that they are not broken, but beautiful little apex organisms–the result of billions of years of evolution–whose cells are powered by a giant nuclear reactor that inevitably rises in the east each day. There is joy in doing hard things, and in the words of Eric Greitens, “Joy is typically a result of your activity, not your aim.”

The agreement stated that if Marvin abandoned Amber nine times for Lydia, the former would have to give up the title........","I Fixed My Ex Husband's Broken Bones Then Broke His Heart

**Chapter 1**  
  
When Marvin Johnson's first love, Lydia Foster, returned, the first thing she did was make a bet with Amber Harper. The agreement stated that if Marvin abandoned Amber nine times for Lydia, the former would have to give up the title of ""Mrs. Johnson."" Amber agreed.  
  
The ninth time, it took only a phone call from Lydia for Ethan to abandon her again on the highway.  
  
""Amber, something urgent came up. Can you get out of the car here and take a cab home?""  
  
Before she could even answer, he shoved an umbrella into her hands, not caring that it was pouring rain outside or that she was on her period. He didn't even ask if she would be okay as he was in too much of a rush to see Lydia.  
  
""Call me when you get home,"" he added.  
  
When she saw him typing Lydia's home address into the GPS, Amber's heart heart twisted painfully. She watched as the sports car sped off, its taillights vanishing into the rain.  
  
The icy wind whipped against her skin, causing her to shiver from the cold. Within seconds, her dress was soaked.  
  
Alone in the downpour, she stumbled down the side of the freeway. Her heels tore into her skin, and soon, her feet were raw and bleeding.  
  
Five hours later, Amber finally made it to Coastal Villa. Her dress was stained a deep crimson with blood, and she collapsed at the gate. She clutched her aching stomach and gasped for air.  
  
Rain blurred her vision. Through the haze, she saw Lydia approach with an umbrella, wearing a smug smile.  
  
""Hurts, doesn't it?""  
  
""Do you regret signing that bet with me now? You really thought that after all these years, Marvin would have developed any real feelings for you? You forgot one thing— I'm the only one he truly loves.""  
  
""Whatever he felt for you was nothing.""  
  
Amber struggled to her feet, her face pale but eerily calm. ""Nine times. You win. I'll divorce Marvin.""  
  
With that, she stumbled toward the house.  
  
Suddenly, a small figure came running out of the villa.  
  
""Mommy!"" Six-year-old Thomas Johnson rushed into the rain, but when he saw Amber soaked through and covered in blood, a flicker of hesitation crossed his little face.  
  
Then he turned to Lydia and grabbed her hand. ""Aunt Lydia, why is Mommy so dirty? Has she been doing those gross surgeries at the hospital again?""  
  
Amber's heart felt like it was being cut by a knife. Even her own son was taking the other woman's side.  
  
Lydia gently stroked Thomas's head. ""Be good, Thomas. Mommy's just tired from work. Come inside now, don't catch cold.""  
  
""I don't want Mommy to hold me—she smells like blood. I want Aunt Lydia to hold me!"" Thomas said, reaching out his arms for Lydia to pick him up.  
  
Watching her son acting sweet and cuddly with another woman, Amber's tears finally began to fall. In the pouring rain, the memories she had tried so hard to bury came flooding back like a tide.  
  
Amber and Lydia were college roommates. Back in freshman year, Lydia had thrown a huge birthday bash, and that night was the first time Amber ever laid eyes on Marvin. With just one look, she was completely drawn in by his aloof, polished charm that left her breathless and her heart pounding like crazy.  
  
That night, Lydia had introduced him to everyone as her childhood best friend. Then, right before everyone, she announced her new boyfriend—a notorious campus troublemaker.  
  
Amber could still remember the shock, pain, and loss of composure on Marvin's face when he heard the news.  
  
One look was all it took for her to know that the person he loved was  
  
With just a glance, she knew exactly the person he loved was Lydia.  
  
Nonetheless, Lydia was always the type to chase thrills, preferring the rebellious bad boy who would skip classes with her, race cars, and seek thrills in bathroom stalls. She had no interest in the proper, well-mannered heir to a fortune like Marvin.  
  
She found Marvin too controlling, and eventually, after discovering Amber's feelings for him, Lydia deliberately created encounters and dinner gatherings, doing everything possible to push him toward Amber, just to get him off her back.  
  
Amber witnessed Marvin's transition from resistance to feeling insulted, then numb, and finally, accepting the situation.  
  
In their junior year, as Lydia had wished, Amber and Marvin became a couple.  
  
Two years later, Marvin proposed.  
  
For three years after marriage, they lived like polite strangers, but their days passing peacefully and warmly.  
  
A year later, Thomas was born.  
  
Amber had truly believed that they would grow old together this way.  
  
Until a month ago, when Lydia returned from abroad and arranged to meet with Amber, proposing a bet.  
  
""Amber, I've changed my mind. I want Marvin back. You two have known each other for nine years now, right? So let's bet on nine incidents. If he abandons you for me nine times, you lose—you'll divorce him and return him to me.""  
  
Amber agreed, almost without thinking. Deep down, she really wanted to know if Lydia still occupied a place in Marvin's heart.  
  
What followed was she learned a brutal lesson in how willingly Marvin would drop everything for Lydia.  
  
**Chapter 2**  
  
The first time was on their third wedding anniversary. Knowing his passion for astronomy, Amber had carefully selected a location and prepared an outdoor picnic to watch a meteor shower together. However, after receiving a text from Lydia, he turned back halfway, leaving her alone on the mountaintop all night in the cold wind.  
  
The second time, Thomas had a high fever at kindergarten and needed emergency medical attention, but just as they were about to leave, he went to rescue Lydia from some thugs who were bothering her, and then disappeared for an entire week. That night, she held their feverish son in the emergency room, waiting all night long...  
  
The third time, her grandmother died, but he left the funeral to have dinner with Paige...  
  
All the love Amber had for him was completely drained away after being abandoned time and again.  
  
It turned out that after all these years, not only did he still have feelings for Lydia, but he had never forgotten her from the beginning...  
  
This time, she knew that she had lost the bet completely. She was ready to own it.  
  
After arriving home, she took a long, hot shower and changed into soft, cozy pajamas. Then, she went to the kitchen and made herself a warm cup of ginger tea. Sipping it slowly, she finally felt alive again.  
  
After that, she pulled out the divorce papers she had prepared on the day of the bet, signed her name, and handed it to Lydia.  
  
""Here. You can be the one to give it to him.""  
  
Lydia raised a brow, looking slightly surprised. ""Why me?""  
  
""I don't want to waste time explaining to him why I want a divorce. Only if you give it to him will he sign without even looking.""  
  
Hearing this, Lydia took the agreement with satisfaction. ""Don't feel too bad."" She offered her sympathy, fake niceties dripping from her voice. ""Give it a few days, and I'll introduce you to some hot new guy.""  
  
""Sure.""  
  
Seeing her quick agreement, Lydia's eyes flashed with surprise.  
  
""You agreed? Have you gotten over Marvin so quickly?""  
  
Amber let out a soft laugh, but there was no joy—only a bitter ache. ""He's the only man I've ever truly given my heart to. And look how that ended. I gave him nine chances, and every single time, I lost. If I still can't walk away, I'd be pathetic. From now on, I'm only living for me.""  
  
Just as she finished speaking, the front door swung open.  
  
Marvin, who had just returned, froze when he saw Lydia.  
  
""Lydia? Didn't I just drop you off at the hospital? Why are you here?""""  
  
Lydia did not bother explaining that her sprained ankle had been nothing more than an act. She just smiled and took the agreement, walking over to him.  
  
""I came to see you. Here, help me sign this.""  
  
Marvin's gaze remained fixed on Paige, not even glancing at the document as he signed where her finger pointed.  
  
After signing, he finally thought to ask what it was.  
  
Lydia opened her mouth to answer but paused. A thought flickered across her mind, and she replied smoothly.  
  
""It's a special gift; something Amber and I worked on together. You'll know what it is in a month. Don't worry, you'll definitely be surprised when you see it!""  
  
Marvin's curiosity was piqued, but before he could examine the document, Lydia quickly handed it back to Amber and stood up to leave.  
  
""Well, that's settled then. Goodnight.""  
  
Marvin's curiosity instantly evaporated, and he quickly offered to drive her home. However, Lydia shook her head and glanced at Amber, her smile cryptic. ""No need. Stay here and keep Amber company. After all, you won't have much time left.""  
  
Marvin frowned, just as he was about to ask about it, Thomas came running downstairs and threw himself directly at Lydia: ""Aunt Lydia, please don't leave, okay?""  
  
""Thomas, Aunt Lydia has to go home now,"" Amber said gently.  
  
Thomas turned around and glared at her: ""Mommy, you're mean! Why are you making Aunt Lydia leave? You're just jealous that Daddy likes her!""  
  
Hearing her son's words, Amber's heart was pierced with pain once again. Even a six-year-old could see Marvin's favoritism.  
  
Lydia crouched down and hugged Thomas: ""Be good, Thomas. Mommy isn't making Auntie leave. Auntie just has to go home now.""  
  
""I don't want Mommy anymore! I want to go with Aunt Lydia!"" Thomas cried out loudly.  
  
""Aunt Lydia buys me yummy food and plays games with me, not like you who always makes me eat that gross stuff that tastes like dog food!""  
  
These words cut through Amber's heart like a knife.  
  
Thomas had a delicate constitution and had been sickly since childhood, so she had always been very careful about his nutrition, preparing healthy meals for him every day with great care.  
  
But every time Lydia came over, she would bring all kinds of junk food, which Thomas naturally preferred.  
  
Marvin walked over at this moment too, joining Lydia in comforting their son.  
  
The three of them stood there, close and intimate, as if they were the real family.  
  
She stood there in a daze, her throat feeling like something was blocking it, unable to make any sound.  
  
Watching this scene, Amber turned around and silently went back to her room.  
  
Her heart felt like it had a hole in it, and the pain left her unable to react at all.  
  
Amber lay on the bed, curled up in a ball, and fell asleep without realizing it.  
  
Late at night, Marvin returned home after seeing Lydia off.  
  
The sound of the door opening echoed faintly, followed by the lights flicking on.  
  
Amber groggily opened her eyes to see Marvin pulling open a drawer, placing a few boxes of condoms inside.  
  
Then, he crawled into bed and gathered her into his arms, his warm breath tickling her ear.  
  
""Didn't you used to wait up for me until midnight? Why did you go to bed so early tonight, hmm?""  
  
Marvin. That was before. It won't happen anymore.  
  
Amber thought silently, making up an excuse. ""I'm on my period. I don't feel well.""  
  
Marvin froze for a second, clearly remembering that he had left her in the rain on the side of the highway. ""Sorry, I forgot.""  
  
""Would it have mattered if you remembered?""  
  
The question left Marvin speechless.  
  
Silence filled the room for a long while before he finally explained in a low voice, ""I'm sorry, Amber. Lydia sprained her ankle. She's been terrified of pain since childhood—that's why I was in such a hurry. I promise this won't happen again.""  
  
A self-mocking smile flashed in Amber's eyes. ""You're right. There definitely won't be a next time.""  
  
After all, they were about to get divorced.  
  
**Chapter 3**  
  
The next morning, Amber woke up to find a mug of warm coffee on her nightstand. Before long, Marvin walked in with breakfast in hand, saying, ""Amber, drink your coffee, and let's eat.""  
  
It was a scene she used to wake up to every day, before Lydia came back into their lives. Back then, she had mistaken this routine for love, which was why she had foolishly agreed to Lydia's bet. In the end, she lost everything.  
  
This time, she did not respond like she used to. Instead, she got up, went to her closet, and picked out an outfit.  
  
""No thanks. I don't have much of an appetite. I need to go out soon, so you go on ahead.""  
  
After washing up, she grabbed her purse and headed for the door. However, Marvin also picked up his jacket, insisting on giving her a ride. She did not have the energy to argue, so she gave in.  
  
As soon as Amber got into the car, she noticed something amiss. The dreamcatcher she had hung on the rearview mirror was gone, replaced with a cutesy plush keychain. The dashboard had also been redecorated with an entire row of Kayromi figurines.  
  
Marvin noticed her stare and quickly offered an explanation. ""I parked by the curb yesterday and forgot to close the windows. The dreamcatcher got soaked. My assistant Hayden cleaned up and swapped in some new stuff.""  
  
Was it really his assistant?  
  
She remembered that Lydia loved those trinkets. Her entire guest room was filled with Kayromi merchandise.  
  
Amber did not call Marvin out on the lie. Instead, she simply asked, ""What about my dreamcatcher? I got it at Redwood Mountain, just for you. Give it back to me.""  
  
Marvin's face stiffened. ""Ruth probably threw it out by accident. I'll have her track it down.""  
  
Hearing him continue to cover up, Amber felt only exhaustion.  
  
""If it's gone, then forget about it. I don't want it anymore.""  
  
He looked surprised. ""You really don't want it?""  
  
Amber gave a nod and mumbled, ""I don't.""  
  
The lucky charm, this marriage, this man—she was done with all of it.  
  
At the country club, Amber headed straight to Room 908. The space was already filled with people, and her college friends eagerly greeted her.  
  
""Amber! Did you come alone? Didn't bring your husband? Is Marvin buried in work or something?""  
  
Before she could say a single word, Lydia, who was seated right in the middle, chimed in casually. ""He has a meeting this morning that runs until 11:00 am. Then, he's heading straight into another negotiation in the afternoon. He definitely doesn't have time.""  
  
Seeing how well she knew Marvin's schedule, everyone half-jokingly commented.  
  
""I guess childhood sweethearts really do know each other best, huh? She's got his calendar down better than his assistant!""  
  
Lydia raised her glass and swirled it gently, smiling faintly. ""Oh, Marvin just mentioned it when he drove me home last night around midnight.""  
  
Someone chuckled. ""Wow! Are you two still keeping in touch like that? It's no surprise, though. You two grew up together. How fortunate for Marvin that Amber's so understanding. Any other woman would've lost her mind knowing that her husband used to follow Lydia around like a puppy.""  
  
Another chimed in, laughing, ""Amber is married to the CEO of Johnson Corp. She has a perfect marriage and a perfect life. And Lydia's the one who set them up in the first place. Why would she be jealous? Let's be real—if Lydia wanted Marvin, she could've had him years ago. Everyone knows that he's wrapped around her finger.""  
  
Hearing this, Lydia looked increasingly pleased.  
  
""It's a funny story, actually. Back then, I was the one who told him to pursue Amber in the first place. Even the proposal was my idea. I kept telling him that he owed Amber a real title, and he finally caved. Those who knew better understood he and Amber were dating, but those who didn't might have thought I forced them together.""",1,1749067162.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

So, my brilliant self tried to use one finger to pull open a door labeled push. My hands were full... anyways I am a calisthenics trainer so I pulled really hard and felt a pop and sharp pain. The pain hasn't stopped since and it's been 48 hours. 

I don't typically swell under any circumstance (even with my wisdom teeth) and I have a neurological disorder that messes with my ability to gage most pain levels or muscular skeletal issues. So I cannot tell you my pain levels. 

The pain sensations are stinging and burning. I can move my finger but with a sharp shooting sensation down into my wrist and elbow. When I grasp anything like a phone, coffee mug, or steering wheel I feel as though there is an air bubble or 'rock' around my inner (medicarpul???? The long hand bone connecting to the big knuckle). Making a fist is the worst as there is alot of pressure in my hand around the bone connected to my finger. I cannot do weight bearing exercises like pull ups and pulling. 

Does this seem like a tendon/ ligament issue or should I look into getting an Xray for a stress fracture? I don't have primary care set up yet so I am doing my best to avoid urgent care.

## Key Features Analysis

The best copper tea kettles of 2025 boast a combination of aesthetic appeal and practical functionality. They offer superior heat conductivity, durability, and designs that complement any kitchen decor. Let's dive into some of the key features that set thes kettles apart.

**Material and Construction:** The quality of the copper used in the kettle's construction is paramount. Top-tier kettles are typically made from heavy-gauge, 100% pure copper or copper with a high copper content. This ensures even heat distribution, prevents hot spots, and maximizes heat retention. The thickness of the copper also contributes to the kettle's durability and longevity, making it resistant to dents and warping. Internal linings can also vary,from tin to stainless steel,each affecting the kettle's performance and maintenance requirements.**Handle Design and Ergonomics:** The handle of a copper tea kettle plays a crucial role in its usability and safety. Ergonomic designs, often featuring heat-resistant materials like wood or bakelite, provide a agreeable and secure grip. A well-designed handle minimizes the risk of burns and allows for easy pouring, even when the kettle is full. Some handles are fixed, while others are foldable for compact storage. The handle's construction and attachment to the kettle body are critical for ensuring stability and preventing leaks.

**Spout Design and Pour Quality:** The spout is another essential element of any tea kettle. A well-designed spout ensures a smooth, controlled pour without drips or splatters. Gooseneck spouts, common in pour-over coffee setups, offer precise water flow for optimal brewing. Other spouts might potentially be wider and shorter, designed for quicker pouring. The angle and shape of the spout can significantly impact the user experience,making it important to consider when choosing a kettle.**Capacity and Size:** Copper tea kettles come in a variety of sizes, typically ranging from 1.5 liters to 3 liters. The ideal capacity depends on your specific needs. Smaller kettles are suitable for single servings or smaller households, while larger kettles are better for entertaining or families who drink tea frequently. Consider the size of your stovetop and storage space when deciding on the optimal capacity.

**Base Design and Compatibility:** the base of a copper tea kettle determines its compatibility with different stovetop types. Flat-bottomed kettles are generally suitable for gas,electric,and ceramic stovetops. Kettles with a wider base tend to heat water more quickly and efficiently.Some copper kettles are also induction-compatible, featuring a magnetic stainless steel base fused to the copper body. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility with your stovetop.

**Aesthetic Design and Finish:** Beyond functionality, the aesthetic appeal of a copper tea kettle is a significant factor for many buyers. Copper kettles come in a variety of finishes, including polished, hammered, and brushed. Polished copper offers a bright, reflective surface, while hammered copper provides a textured, rustic look. Brushed copper offers a more matte and understated appearance. The finish can also affect the kettle's maintenance requirements, as some finishes are more prone to tarnishing than others.

Key features of a quality copper tea kettle include:

*   heavy-gauge copper construction
*   Ergonomic, heat-resistant handle
*   Precision-pour spout design
*   Suitable capacity for your needs
*   Stovetop compatibility
*   Aesthetic design that complements your kitchen

## Core Benefits

copper tea kettles offer a range of benefits beyond their visual appeal. From superior heat performance to potential health benefits, these kettles provide a unique and enjoyable tea-making experience.

**Superior Heat Conductivity:** Copper's exceptional heat conductivity allows water to heat up quickly and evenly, saving time and energy. A copper kettle will bring water to a boil faster than kettles made from other materials like stainless steel or glass. This rapid heating also helps to preserve the delicate flavors of tea by minimizing the time the water spends at high temperatures.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:** A well-made copper tea kettle is a durable and long-lasting investment. Copper is a strong and resilient metal that can withstand years of use with proper care. Unlike some materials,copper does not rust or corrode,ensuring that your kettle will remain functional and attractive for many years to come. The thickness of the copper also contributes to its resistance to dents and damage.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Timeless Elegance:** Copper tea kettles add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any kitchen. Their warm, reddish-brown hue complements a variety of decor styles, from traditional to modern. Whether displayed on the stovetop or showcased on a shelf, a copper kettle serves as a beautiful and functional piece of kitchen art. The natural patina that develops over time adds character and charm to the kettle.

**Antimicrobial Properties:** Copper possesses natural antimicrobial properties, inhibiting the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. This can help to keep your water cleaner and safer to drink. While the antimicrobial effects are limited in a kettle due to the short contact time, it's an added benefit for those concerned about water quality.

**Improved Flavor and Aroma:** According to some tea connoisseurs, heating water in a copper kettle can enhance the flavor and aroma of tea. This is attributed to the copper's ability to distribute heat evenly and quickly, preventing the water from becoming overheated or acquiring a metallic taste.The result is a smoother, more flavorful cup of tea.

## FAQs Section

choosing the right copper tea kettle can be daunting, especially with the wide variety of options available. Here are some frequently asked questions to help you make an informed decision.**Are copper tea kettles safe to use?**
Yes, copper tea kettles are generally safe to use, as long as they are properly lined. Pure copper can react with water,potentially leaching copper ions into the water. To prevent this, most copper tea kettles are lined with tin or stainless steel, creating a barrier between the water and the copper. Ensure the lining is intact and free from damage before using the kettle.

**How do I clean and maintain a copper tea kettle?**
Cleaning a copper tea kettle requires gentle care to preserve its finish and prevent tarnishing. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes, as these can scratch the surface. Rather,use a soft cloth and warm,soapy water to clean the exterior. To remove tarnish, you can use a commercially available copper cleaner or a homemade solution of vinegar, salt, and flour. rinse the kettle thoroughly after cleaning and dry it with a soft cloth.

**Can I use a copper tea kettle on an induction stovetop?**
Not all copper tea kettles are compatible with induction stovetops.Induction cooktops require cookware with a magnetic base to generate heat. To use a copper kettle on an induction stovetop, it must have a magnetic stainless steel base fused to the copper body. Check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility.

**How often should I descale my copper tea kettle?**
The frequency of descaling depends on the hardness of your water. If you live in an area with hard water, you may need to descale your kettle more frequently. Look for signs of mineral buildup,such as white or chalky deposits inside the kettle. To descale, you can boil a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar in the kettle. Let the mixture sit for an hour, then rinse the kettle thoroughly with clean water.

We’ve met a few times before and they’ve shown a kind interest in my project.

I’m a historian by training, but due to the nature of the historically marginalised community I’m studying (which overlaps heavily with the anthropologist’s fieldsite), I’m planning to do some fieldwork there this summer. I’d really like to make the most of this conversation, but am not sure how to.

I know they’re not particularly interested in being “buttered up” by being asked to talk at length about their own work for the sake of it so I’d rather focus on thoughtful, relevant discussion points.

So far, here’s what I’ve been thinking of bringing up:
	•	As an outsider, how can I best use my positionality in a respectful and constructive way?
	•	I sometimes feel like I have no right to study something I’m not part of — and I struggle with whether my research can even make a difference. Is that normal, and how do you handle that?
	•	Any advice for getting along with locals and navigating the dynamics of being a visiting researcher?
      •      Best ways to gain familiarity with the local dialect? 
	•	How to build connections with local academics and researchers who may not have institutional links?

Are there any other questions or angles I should consider bringing up in this meeting? I want to make the most of it but am feeling kind of stuck with how, so any help will be appreciated!

Thanks so much in advance!

1l3f6si,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3f6si,RSS Dashboard - Beta Version is Finally Here!,"Hello lovely people!

Back in March, I shared [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1jd5ccf/working_on_a_new_obsidian_plugin_rss_dashboard/) announcing that I was working on a new plugin, RSS Dashboard, and was blown away by your response. I’ve spent the last couple of months building this out, incorporating your suggestions, and making it as useful as possible. Today, I’m thrilled to share that the beta version is ready! 

  
I’d love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think. As always, I’m open to feedback, suggestions, and ideas for improvement. I want to refine it as much as I can before final submission for community plugin.   
  
What is RSS Dashboard?  
It's an obsidian plugin to bring your favorite RSS feeds, Youtube videos, and podcasts (working on) more directly inside Obsidian. You can collect your feeds, consume them (read, watch, or listen), and save them as Markdown file**,** perfect for archiving, referencing, or just building a knowledge base of what *you* want to consume.

I am also open if you guys have a better name for this plugin for final release. Also let me know if current name is okay to move ahead with. 

[Download here - Github Link](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard)

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/YwBu3Kdn1Qk)

The delay in release was mostly due to school. I had exams, a paper to finish, and a conference to attend and to top it off, my laptop broke 😅 I’ve been borrowing my college’s laptop for few weeks now. If you enjoy my plugins and feel like tossing a few bucks my way to help me, it would mean the world (and help me maintain these plugins better too).

## Key Features Analysis

The quality water bottle bag is more than just a holder; it's a carefully designed piece of gear. Modern water bottle bags incorporate features that enhance both functionality and style.

**Insulation:** A well-insulated bag will keep your drinks at the perfect temperature for hours.

Insulation is crucial for maintaining the temperature of your beverages, whether you're keeping water ice-cold or preventing coffee from getting lukewarm. Effective insulation often comes from materials like neoprene,closed-cell foam,or thermal linings that create a barrier against external temperature fluctuations. Look for bags that specify the duration of temperature retention, as this can vary significantly based on the quality and thickness of the insulation.

**Adjustable Straps and Carrying Options:** Versatility in carrying options is essential for different activities.

Adjustable straps allow you to customize the fit of the bag, ensuring comfort and stability while you're on the move. Some bags offer multiple carrying options, such as shoulder straps, cross-body straps, or even handles for hand-carrying.Consider the types of activities you'll be using the bag for and choose one with the appropriate carrying style. A bag with a detachable strap can also be advantageous, allowing you to switch between carrying styles as needed.**Durable Materials:** High-quality materials ensure the bag can withstand daily wear and tear.

The durability of a water bottle bag depends heavily on the materials used in its construction. Look for bags made from rugged fabrics like ripstop nylon,polyester canvas,or even recycled materials for added sustainability. Reinforcements at stress points, such as the seams and strap attachments, further enhance the bag's longevity. Water-resistant or waterproof materials are also desirable, especially if you plan to use the bag in outdoor conditions.

**Pocket and Storage Options:** Extra storage for essentials increases the bag's functionality.Many water bottle bags feature additional pockets and storage compartments for holding essentials like phones, keys, wallets, or small snacks. These pockets can be zippered, mesh, or flap-covered, depending on the level of security and accessibility they offer. Consider the types of items you typically carry with your water bottle and choose a bag with sufficient storage capacity and organization. A small front pocket for keys or a larger compartment for a phone can significantly enhance the bag's practicality.

Key features of high-quality water bottle bags include:

* Durable construction
* Insulated lining
* Adjustable straps
* multiple pockets

## core Benefits

The advantages of using a water bottle bag extend beyond simply carrying a drink. They offer practical benefits that improve your daily routine and enhance your overall experience.

**Hands-Free Convenience:** A water bottle bag frees up your hands, allowing you to focus on other tasks.

With a water bottle bag, you no longer have to juggle a drink in your hand while walking, hiking, or shopping. This hands-free convenience allows you to maintain better balance, carry other items more easily, and generally move more freely. Whether you're navigating a crowded city street or exploring a hiking trail, having your hands free can make a meaningful difference in your comfort and safety.

**Temperature Regulation:** an insulated bag keeps your drinks cold or hot for extended periods.

Insulated water bottle bags provide temperature regulation, ensuring that your cold drinks stay refreshingly chilled and your hot beverages remain pleasantly warm for longer. This is particularly valuable in extreme weather conditions, where drinks can quickly lose their desired temperature. Whether you're braving a summer heatwave or venturing out on a chilly winter day, an insulated bag can help you maintain an enjoyable drinking experience.

**Protection and Security:** A bag protects your water bottle from damage and prevents leaks.A water bottle bag provides a protective barrier for your water bottle, preventing scratches, dents, and other damage that can occur during transport. Bags with secure closures and sturdy materials also help prevent leaks, minimizing the risk of spills and messes. This protection is especially critically important for glass or stainless steel bottles that are more susceptible to breakage.

**Stylish and Customizable:** Water bottle bags come in a variety of styles, allowing you to express your personal taste.

Water bottle bags are available in a wide range of styles, colors, and materials, allowing you to choose one that complements your personal taste and lifestyle. From minimalist designs to bold patterns, there's a bag to suit every aesthetic. Some bags also offer customizable features,such as interchangeable straps or detachable accessories,allowing you to further personalize your hydration gear.

Some bags feature adjustable closures or elastic straps that can accommodate bottles of varying sizes.

**Is the bag machine washable?**

Check the care instructions on the bag's label for specific cleaning recommendations.**How durable is the insulation?**
The durability of the insulation depends on the quality of the materials used. High-quality insulation, such as neoprene or closed-cell foam, can maintain temperature for several hours.Avoid bags with thin or flimsy insulation, as they may not provide adequate temperature regulation. Test the bag's insulation by filling it with hot or cold water and monitoring the temperature over time.

For starters, I live in Greece.

My phone is sadly overheating to the point where I have to go for a new one. I say sadly cause I really do not care about having the latest device, as long as the usages I want it for are being met.

That being said, Nothing looks promising, and with a lot of value per euro spent to offer.

The use cases I want my phone for are:

\- Spending some time on youtube / insta, though not that much. I do like it to be snappy though  
\- Gps for when I travel. I use a motorcycle, so there is some sun exposure.  
\- Running android apps I develop, so the battery takes a toll on a daily basis  
\- General usage such as using my banking app, ordering a coffee, some talking on the phone ect

With the above in mind, and keeping in mind I do not want to overspend for features I will not really use, such as a better camera, would going above the 2a model make sense?

I can find, brand new, the 2a (8GB/128GB) at 250 euros, whereas the 3a (12GB/256GB) for 330 euros.

I would pay for better battery, which the 3a seems to not have, and lack of overheating (though this should not be an issue at any of the 2)

Of course, any other recommendation in that price range is welcomed

r/relationships/comments/1j4pgjt/how\_does\_a\_34\_year\_old\_male\_virgin\_with\_6/

I did meet a woman when travelling and I again I had difficulty getting an erection. I enjoyed her company and we had some fantastic days together, but she was very overweight and 10 years older than me. The country I was in sold Cialis over the counter, and after a 2nd attempt it worked.. So I did manage to have sex, really for the first time..… Maybe if an opportunity comes I can use this as a crutch to figure things out. I’m terrible at having sex, I find sex physically awkward, maybe this will improve. But this aspect is solved, at least to an extent.

Now I'm back home and faced with the same situation, the only women that will match with me on apps want a commitment that I will have children and or marriage before even a coffee date. I've never lived with a woman nor really had a relationship with a woman. The women my age are locked on like a missile to having children, they don’t have the time to allow me to figure things out. I also don’t want to waste their time.

Can I really hide this situation from the women? Should I be hiding it? The women matching with me certainly don’t expect this situation when they bring up children and marriage.

Why is it so easy for me to have children but so difficult to casually date?

How do I explain that I have never really had sex or a relationship at 34 years old but I have managed to have 6 children? How can I be honest about this? It feels so toxic to discuss.

TL;DR I had difficulty meeting women, I went travelling later in life, kissed a woman for the first time at 26 years old, found I couldn’t even have sex any more, privately donated sperm, I don’t know how to move forward.",0,1749066341.0,relationships,5,0.43,False
1l3f3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardReddit/comments/1l3f3ek/abdullah_how_we_got_together_qa_with_neville/,Abdullah How We Got Together Q&A With Neville Goddard,"Now are there any questions, please? Yes, sir?

(Question mostly inaudible but about Abdullah and imagining and demonstrating)

Well, I’ll tell you in details exactly how we got together.

It was 1933. If you remember, there was a frightful Depression on in our country. Millions were unemployed. In New York City, you would go through the tunnel into Gimbel’s (Department Store) from, say, the square (Herald Square), where Gimbel’s begins… it goes all the way through to the… well, the Holland Tunnel. They were sleeping with the permission of the Mayor… three and four deep, as far as the eye could go. There was no place to go. In the park, in the summer months, they were allowed to sleep in the park, sleep all over the place. And the long lines for coffee and bread were there to give them. There were millions unemployed. We then had a population of not more than, say, a hundred thirty million, as against today’s a hundred ninety two million.

I was a dancer, and if you couldn’t eat, you couldn’t pay to watch a dancer, so there were no shows playing on Broadway. I think we had five Broadway shows, and they were running on paper… just.. (unintelligible 1:20) passing out paper to go and see them, really, instead of the usual 50 to 60 shows that you usually get.

Well, what I’m getting at is, I didn’t have a job, I had no money, and I was living in a basement on 75th Street and he (Abdullah) lived on 72nd Street, in a very lovely home that was owned by Morgenthau, whose son (Henry Morgenthau Jr) was then the treasury (sic) of our country, a cabinet member (US Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt), but his father owned this house, but he didn’t live there, and he rented the first floor to my friend Abdullah.

I said to Abdullah, in the month of October, late October, “Ab, you know I’ve been gone from Barbados for almost twelve years… I came here in ’22. And it’s almost 12 years, and I’ve never had a desire to go back. But now I have a hungry desire, a haunting desire, to go to Barbados. Not a thing stops me but a lack of money. I have no money.”

He said to me, “You are in Barbados.”

I said, “I am in Barbados?”

He said, “Yes. You are now in Barbados. And so… you see Barbados, and you see America from Barbados, and you can smell the tropical land of Barbados, see only the little homes of Barbados, and that’s all you do. You just simply sleep this night in Barbados.”

Well, I thought him insane, really… I mean, at the moment, it seemed so… stupid. Because… 72nd Street, we still had 50- and 60-story buildings. And little Barbados with a little three-story building almost the tallest that you’d find. And narrow little streets and no sidewalks. And I’m walking on a sidewalk that is wider than the widest street in Barbados on 72nd Street.

Well, nevertheless, that night I slept in Barbados. I assumed that I’m in Barbados in my mother’s home, and that I saw America relative to Barbados, and it wasn’t under me that night… it was north of me, about two thousand miles.

Well, the next day, I didn’t tell him anything… about a week later when nothing happened, I thought I would approach him. This time we’ve moved into November.

I said, “You know, Ab, there’s no… not a thing has happened.”

He wouldn’t discuss it with me. He turned his back on me and went into his little library and slammed the door.

About three times I tried to open up the discussion with my friend Ab between that moment when I first talked to him and the end. He would never discuss it, on the basis: “How could he discuss with me how I am going to Barbados when I am already in Barbados?” That’s stupid to discuss how I’m going to go when I am in Barbados! And if I am faithful to my assumption, I can’t discuss the “how.” I’m already there!

Well, this went on… on the morning of the fourth day of December… there’s no job, no place to go… and the last boat that will get me there by Christmas is going to sail on the sixth.

Under my door is a little letter from my brother Victor. And he said, “As a family we were never around the table at Christmas together. That Cecil”– he’s my oldest brother… he left home before the last was born, because we have a large family; there’s eight years between my sister Daphne, who was the eighth child, and then my brother Joe. Well, in that interval, my brother Cecil went off to Demerara. So… never as a family were we ever together at Christmas. So in the letter, he justifies why he’s asked me to come. “I know you don’t have a job, and there’s no excuse for not coming. And so I’m enclosing a draft for fifty dollars… you may need a shirt, a pair of shoes, socks or something, and I’ve notified the Furness Withy Line that you’ll come for a ticket. So the ticket is waiting for you at the Furness Line.”

Well, I was so excited… I rushed on down to the Furness Line and I told– gave them my letter. They said, “Yes, we have a message here from your family in Barbados. We’ll give you a ticket, but we haven’t any First Class tickets left. You can go Third Class, and use the facilities of the First. But you have to sleep Third Class, until you hit the island of St. Thomas. When you hit St. Thomas, someone disembarks, then you may take a First Class bunk.”

I said, “I’ll take it.”

I rushed right up to Abdullah, and I said, “Ab, I got my ticket for Barbados, but I have to go Third Class.” I’m all elated and happy about it.

He said, “Who told you that you are going to Barbados? And who told you that you went to Barbados Third Class? You went to Barbados, and you went First Class.”

Would say no more.

He isn’t even happy that I’m going to Barbados now. (audience laughter)

So I went down on the morning of the sixth day of December, with my Third Class ticket. Went up to the desk as they’re checking in the passengers, and I put my ticket forward, and they said “I’ve got good news for you, Mr. Goddard. Someone has cancelled, and you’re going First Class.”

And I went First Class all the way down to Barbados. Ten days down; ten days back, with three heavenly months in Barbados.

So all that I did… I tried to the best of my ability to with his almost insolence… he was rude. But he taught me by his rudeness that I cannot discuss how if I am doing what I’m supposed to do. He tells me right away, “You are in Barbados.” Like someone comes to you now, and you would apply this principle toward their request, and they say, “Oh, I would love to be happily married.” And you say to her, or him, “You are now happily married.” They look at you as though you’re insane.

But that’s exactly what you’re supposed to do. “You are now happily married.” Well, if I am now happily married and I’m a lady, I would instantly begin to feel that ring there in my imagination. And I’d let others see that I have my ring– well, that would imply I’m happily married, a wedding ring… and so if I don’t wear it from then on, I’m not doing what I’m supposed to do.

So in my imagination, I have to go to bed wearing my ring, and actually do all that I would do in that state.

Oh, he said, “You’re in Barbados.” And I’m in New York City physically, but he put me in Barbados in my imagination. So that I slept in Barbados to the best of my ability. But you know days go into weeks, and the weeks went into a month, and I’m trying my best to open the discussion with him, to get a little hope. No, no hope! (audience laughter) He wouldn’t give me any encouragement if I did what he told me to do. Well, we all are human enough to want another little discussion, another little push. And so he taught me the lesson that there is no such thing as “a little pregnancy.” (audience laughter) No such thing. If you did it, then you’re pregnant. Let the child grow. And interference with it is going to be a miscarriage. “You assume that you are in Barbados.” Now you are pregnant. The idea is that you are going to give birth to a journey which will land you right in Barbados. So you’ve assumed it. That is conception. Now, don’t try to argue. You have conceived. And all you have to do is be a faithful mother, and bear that child, and don’t discuss it with me anymore.

He never discussed it, after he told me I was in Barbados.

And I learned so many things from the old fellow. I came back, because I wasn’t drinking– I brought him two lovely old bottles of brandy. The best that we have on the island… two lovely bottles, and some rum. So I gave him my father’s rum, gave him the brandy.

A week later, he said to me, “Say… how long do you expect those things to last?” (audience laughter)

I learned my lesson. I thought he would sip those things for a year– oh, no! They were gone! And he wondered how long I supposed these things to last for him.

And of course he really disillusioned me terribly on so many things because I would go and dine with him, and Abdullah… I was then a strict vegetarian. I was trying to overcome it, after I came back… gradually. And of course he would sit down and he would have two or three big shots of rye–I mean, big shots of rye– and then he would wash down his meal with a lot of Porter, or… it wasn’t beer, it was ale… and then he would at the end, like Churchill, a huge big bowl of ice cream.

I said, “Ab, how can you do that?”

“Oh,” he said, “you couldn’t do it… it would poison you, because you have quibbles.” (audience laughter) “But you know that God made everything? Everything is God. You would assume that he made something and not the rest? No, God made everything.” And he’ll send me back to the Bible. “Go back to the Bible and read the book of Acts.”

“And Peter couldn’t eat the unclean thing. And then the Lord said, ‘Slay and eat, for that which I have cleansed, I have cleansed.’” Then a sheet (?) came down filled with all manner of animals and food. And the voice said to Peter, “Slay and eat, for that which I have cleansed, I have cleansed.”

So he said, “You have quibbles, Neville. With any of your quibbles, it’d poison you.”

But he would sit down and polish off this enormous meal, and wash it down with ale, preceded with three shots of rye. And here was a man truly of the spirit.

But if I judge from appearances, I would say, “Well, he can’t be a holy man.” For which today I am most grateful that he wasn’t! Because he taught me real Christianity. And he was born in North Africa, of Jewish parents, and raised in a strict Orthodox Jewish home. But he knew more Christianity than anyone I’ve ever met, because he spoke the Hebrew tongue perfectly. He spoke other tongues. And Rabbis would come to study with him. And he and I would discuss, day in and day out, for over five years, teaching me all that he could teach me that I could absorb concerning the Kabbalah, the great mystery of how this thing is put together in these simple little letters of Hebrew.

I know that in the– before the Civil Rights Bill, in New York City, no negro could go to the box office and buy a seat in the orchestra. You’d get a seat in the balcony. You think Abdullah would ever let me go and buy the seats? No. Abdullah would go right straight down to the box office–and he was a negro, I tell you– and he’d go right down and say, “I want two in the center. I don’t want too far back. Not beyond the sixth row. Right in the center.”

“Yes, sir.”

Buy the two seats. For any show.

The first opera I saw, Abdullah took me to it. It was Parsifal.

Five hours, and I’d never seen one before. It seemed it would never come to an end. Of all the operas to be introduced to opera, through Parsifal. Good Friday it was, too… you go on Good Friday in New York, he said, when you go to Parsifal, and you sit there, and think “My Lord, is it ever going to come to an end?” And he is drinking it in, every little note, he understands every little point, and he’s so in love with it. And I’m sitting because I’m next to Ab, just waiting, hoping… but nothing happens… it goes on and on and on and it’s five hours later, and then… that’s it.

This recap includes key takeaways and a bit of commentary to help make sense of what happened—and what it might mean for Sammamish moving forward.



Public Comment – Inglewood Road Reclassification Sparks Outcry

Roughly 20 residents spoke during public comment, most from the Inglewood area. Their shared concern: a city notice had been mailed informing them that roads currently maintained by the city were being reclassified as private, and that maintenance would end in 30 days. The notice came without prior outreach, explanation, or alternatives.

Speakers were passionate, organized, and clearly blindsided. Council members appeared surprised by the intensity of the response. After a lengthy executive session, Council returned and voted to continue maintaining the roads in Inglewood while exploring long-term solutions—effectively removing the June 30 deadline.

This was a rare and powerful example of public comment directly influencing Council action.

Public Hearing – Amendments to Title 21 of the Sammamish Municipal Code

The hearing addressed a series of municipal code changes, many of which have been circulating between the Planning Commission and City Council for months.

One of the most controversial changes was the modification of the *fee in-lieu* for affordable housing. Simply put, this is an additional fee based on the square footage of a home. Homes under 1,500 sq ft are exempt. However, the fee also applies to homeowners planning to expand past that threshold—or rebuild a larger home after a fire, for example.

The Planning Commission had recommended an exemption for individual (non-corporate) builders. The Council majority chose to ignore that recommendation, opting instead to apply the fee uniformly—citing the goal of supporting affordable housing.

Here’s the irony:  
During public comment, one speaker shared that she and her husband—both teachers—had been unable to afford a home in Sammamish. But they *were* able to purchase a piece of land, and had spent years working toward building their home. With the newly approved fee in-lieu charge, their project now faces tens of thousands in added costs—potentially making it unaffordable.

These are exactly the types of residents the city claims to support. Instead, the Council majority just priced them out. Not one Council member from the majority asked the speaker to follow up or offered to connect.

Apparently, it takes a packed room of angry residents to get the Council’s attention. A policy intended to increase affordability has now possibly pushed two teachers out of the city.

 

Unfinished Business – Draft Town Center Plan and SEIS Overview

Council reviewed the pre-release version of the Draft Town Center Plan and the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS).

Key Dates:

* June 9: Full SEIS release
* June 11 (5:30–7:30 PM): Community Open House @ Farmers Market
* July 9: Deadline for public comments
* The tentative full calendar is pictured

Two planning alternatives will ultimately be considered:

1. No Action – Maintain the current Town Center plan
2. Major Revisions – Allow up to 4,000 new residential units

The presentation was polished and visually optimistic—but left many unanswered questions. How will thousands of new units impact traffic, schools, emergency services, utilities, and water capacity?

Building Height & Density Concerns

One of the more confusing elements was the reappearance of building height increases. Although the Council had previously backed away from exploring a 150’ limit, that number reappeared in this presentation, alongside new mentions of 85’ structures (the current limit is 75’). Council members continue to insist they are not pursuing increased heights—but no vote has ever confirmed that. So why do these height discussions keep showing up?

As staff noted, if height limits are raised, developers will be allowed to build up to those maximums—and the city cannot control the type or style of what is ultimately built. Despite the attractive renderings shown during the presentation, there’s no guarantee they’ll reflect reality.

Affordable Housing – Still Missing?

Interestingly, the presentation itself acknowledged that affordable housing in the Town Center has not materialized to the extent originally planned. Yet now the proposal includes adding *another* 2,000 units in hopes of getting it right this time. That raises a fair question: *If the city didn’t achieve affordable housing outcomes under the original plan, what’s different now?*

Shift to Form-Based Code

Another major proposed change is a shift from a unit-count-based code to form-based code. According to the presentation, this would prioritize the physical form and design of buildings rather than how many units are built. But here’s the key detail: the final “form” would still be determined by the applicant or developer—not the city.

While it was noted that *unit counts would still have to meet traffic concurrency, school concurrency, water certification, and sewer certification*, this new framework raises more questions than it answers.

This is new and potentially confusing territory. Residents may want to keep a close watch on how form-based code is implemented—and how it could affect the future character of Sammamish.

How Much Is This Costing Us?

One key question remains unanswered: How much is this costing us, as Sammamish taxpayers, to go through this entire planning process again?

 

Ordinance – Changes to Chapter 2.60 (Planning Commission)

Council voted 6–1 to approve amendments to Chapter 2.60, which officially reduce the role of the Planning Commission—a volunteer group of residents that has long served as a community advisory body.

The move shifts some responsibilities from the Commission to city staff. According to staff, this simply formalizes changes already in practice. Still, as seen in the public hearing on the in-lieu fee, Council has increasingly dismissed the Commission’s input. This vote codifies that trend—minimizing structured community involvement in city planning.

  
New Business – SE 6th Street Design Contract

Council approved a $305,695 contract (plus 10% reserve) with Perteet Inc. to design a portion of SE 6th Street in the Town Center. This is part of a $2.6 million project the Council previously approved—despite acknowledged budget concerns.

The developer handling the adjacent section of SE 6th is using a different firm. That firm did not bid on the city’s portion, raising questions about how the two designs will integrate. Additional concerns were raised about Perteet’s performance on past Sammamish projects.

  
City Manager Report – Key Dates

* June 7 (Saturday, 9:30 AM): Coffee with Council @ Metropolitan Market
* June 11 (Wednesday, 5:30–7:30 PM): Community Open House on SEIS @ Farmers Market
* June 12 (Thursday, 6:30 PM): Meeting between Inglewood residents and the City

  
Final Observations

The standout moment of the night was Council’s decision to reverse course on Inglewood road reclassification—showing that when residents show up and speak out, they *can* make a difference.

But elsewhere—particularly on housing policy and Town Center planning—the meeting reinforced a growing concern: Council only listens when faced with a room full of frustrated residents.

The city’s decisions on development, fees, and community input continue to feel disconnected from the lived experiences of Sammamish families.

With the SEIS release and Town Center decisions looming, June could be a critical month for civic engagement.

I’m Ashiraf from Uganda 🇺🇬. I originally studied Oil & Gas Production Engineering (yes, pipelines, simulations, reservoir models, all that deep geeky stuff 😅). I was all in — using tools like Petrel, OLGA, CMG, Pipesim and optimizing flows, until I stumbled onto something that completely changed my trajectory...

While working on my final-year project — a pipeline monitoring system — I thought, “Why not build an app to visualize this data in real time?” 🤔

That’s when I discovered Flutter 💙 and it was like flipping a switch in my brain.

I didn’t have a CS background. No software papers. Just tutorials, docs, trial and error… and a lot of coffee ☕. Within weeks, I was building apps that:

Pull real-time sensor data from Firebase
Display live dashboards 📊
Detect anomalies using TensorFlow Lite (hello, autoencoders 👀)
Implement clean architecture, BLoC, GetIt, CSV exports — the full stack!
I realized software gave me superpowers. I wasn’t abandoning engineering — I was evolving it. Now I build solutions that bridge the gap between hardware and intelligence — things like pipeline monitoring, anomaly detection, and industrial safety tools.

💬 I don't have a CS degree. But I have proof of work and a hunger to keep learning.

If you’re pivoting careers or feel like you don’t “belong” in tech, hear me out: skills > papers.

Now I'm texting my contractor about installing them in every bathroom. This is my love letter to the machine that changed my life.

Look, I used to be one of those people who rolled their eyes at ""luxury bathroom experiences."" Steam showers? Come on. Just take a hot shower and call it a day, right?

I was so painfully wrong it hurts.

# The Backstory: How I Became a Steam Convert

My wife had been dropping hints about a steam shower for literally two years. ""Honey, it would be so relaxing..."" ""Think about the health benefits..."" ""It's like having a spa at home...""

Me, being the practical genius I am: ""We have a perfectly good shower. Why do we need steam?""

Then my back went out. Badly. Physical therapy wasn't cutting it, and I was popping ibuprofen like candy. My wife, with the patience of a saint, said four magic words:

""I'm ordering the Kohler.""

# Enter the Kohler Invigoration 2.0 (AKA My New Religion)

This beast showed up and I immediately knew I was in over my head. The K-32326-NA isn't some cute little steam maker - it's a 9kW monster that looks like it could power a small city. My installer took one look at my electrical panel and started muttering about amp requirements.

I'm standing there thinking, ""What the hell did I just buy?""

**Four hours and $1,795 later: Oh. THAT'S what I bought.**

**Spoiler alert: TOTAL $4,200 I've ever spent.**

# The First Experience That Broke My Brain

Day one: I step into my shower, hit the steam button on the digital controller, and wait.

Within 90 seconds, my bathroom transforms into this otherworldly cloud chamber. The steam isn't just hot air - it's this perfectly calibrated, silky vapor that wraps around you like a warm hug from the universe.

**My exact thought process:**

* Minute 1: ""Okay, this is nice I guess...""
* Minute 5: ""Holy shit, my back pain is melting away""
* Minute 10: ""I understand why people build shrines to things now""
* Minute 15: ""I'm never leaving this bathroom""

# Why the Kohler Is Different (Technical Stuff That Actually Matters)

**The Raw Truth About the 9kW Power:**

Holy shit, this thing doesn't mess around. I flip the switch and BOOM - my bathroom goes from normal to tropical rainforest in 45 seconds flat. Not the weak, pathetic steam I was expecting. This is like standing inside an actual cloud.

The first time it kicked on, I literally jumped. The sound, the instant fog, the way the temperature just HITS you - it's intense. My wife walked in and went ""Jesus Christ, what did you DO in here?""

**Here's What Nobody Tells You:**

The Invigoration 2.0 has this auto-flush thing that scared the crap out of me the first week. You're standing there all zen in your steam cloud, and suddenly this thing starts making sci-fi noises and flushing itself clean. I thought it was broken. Turns out it's just being smart about maintenance.

The aromatherapy feature? I was skeptical as hell. ""I don't need my shower to smell like a damn spa,"" I told my wife. Then I tried the eucalyptus option during a head cold. Game over. I was converted.

# The Unexpected Life Changes

**My Morning Routine:** Used to be coffee, stumble around, eventually shower. Now? 15-minute steam session, then coffee. I start every day feeling like I just got a spa treatment.

**My Back Pain:** Basically gone. I went from hobbling around like an old man to feeling 20 years younger. My physical therapist asked what I was doing differently.

**My Sleep:** The evening steam sessions have turned me into one of those people who actually falls asleep quickly. Who knew?

**My Relationship:** My wife now gives me the ""I told you so"" look daily. She's earned it.

# The Addiction Is Real

I'm not joking when I say I've reorganized my entire schedule around steam time. Morning meetings? After steam. Gym sessions? Steam first. Bad day at work? Steam therapy.

My friends think I've lost it. ""You're obsessed with your shower,"" they say.

**Damn right I am.**

# The ROI Nobody Talks About

Here's something I didn't expect: this thing has basically replaced my gym's sauna, my massage appointments, and my stress-relief shopping habit.

**Monthly savings:**

* Gym with sauna: $120
* Bi-weekly massage: $160
* Stress-induced Amazon purchases: $200+ (don't judge)

The Kohler pays for itself in about 6 months, and that's not even counting the fact that I haven't taken a sick day since installing it.

# The Technical Specs for the Nerds

**Model:** Kohler K-32326-NA Invigoration 2.0 Steam Shower Generator (9kW) **Installation:** Surprisingly straightforward if you have basic plumbing/electrical **Maintenance:** Monthly cleaning cycle, annual professional service **Warranty:** 5 years parts, 2 years labor **Steam time:** Up to 60 minutes continuous **Multiple user profiles:** Yes, because apparently my wife and I have different steam preferences

# The One Downside

I've become insufferably evangelical about steam showers. I bring it up at dinner parties. I show before/after photos of my bathroom to anyone who'll listen. I've turned into that guy who can't shut up about his new obsession.

Also, my water bill went up. Worth every penny.

# Bottom Line: This Changed My Life

I'm not exaggerating when I say the Kohler steam generator has legitimately improved my quality of life. Better sleep, less pain, lower stress, and a daily ritual that I actually look forward to.

If you're on the fence about home steam, stop fence-sitting. If you're choosing between brands, I can't speak for others, but Kohler absolutely nailed this.

**Fair warning:** Once you have steam at home, hotel showers feel like punishment. Regular showers feel incomplete. You'll become that person who texts their contractor about adding steam to every bathroom.

**Anyone else have a Kohler steam setup?** What's your experience been? And please tell me I'm not the only one who's become completely obsessed with their bathroom upgrade. Drop your steam stories below!

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite [here](https://discord.gg/dhzJ2Q3kw7).

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

1l3ex2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1l3ex2a/how_to_apply_for_social_security_easy_steps_to/,How to Apply for Social Security: Easy Steps to the Right Decisions,"Hey RetirementReady folks,

Ever thought about what it's like to retire with a comfortable Social Security check every month? It’s something we all look forward to, but the process of actually getting those benefits can seem a bit daunting. Today, I want to break down how to apply for Social Security in a way that makes sense—and maybe even inspire some stories about your own experiences or questions!

### How to Apply for Social Security: A Simple Guide

#### Introduction
Timing is everything when it comes to Social Security. Getting your ducks in a row early can make a huge difference in how much you’ll receive over your retirement years. Whether you’re already nearing the finish line or just starting to think about it, this guide is for you.

#### Confirm Eligibility
To start, you need to be at least 61 years and 9 months old to apply. Additionally, you must have worked at least 40 quarters (that’s 10 years) contributing to Social Security. This sounds straightforward, but it’s worth checking if you’ve got the required work credits before moving ahead.

When was the first time you realized you needed to check your work credit count? Did it give you any pause?

#### Gather Required Documents
You need to pull together some key documents to smooth the process:
- Your birth date and Social Security number (obviously!).
- Details about your spouse and children, if applicable.
- Your employment history.
- Bank account details for direct deposit.

I once forgot to update the name of my bank after a move, which turned into a minor headache. Have you had any funny or frustrating moments like this?

#### Submit Application
Now comes the fun part—applying! You can do it online at [SSA.gov](https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib), by phone, or in person. If you opt for online, you can fill it out over coffee or a cup of tea. Just be sure your computer is hooked up to a stable internet connection, and voila! If you prefer human interaction, hitting up your local Social Security office can be a good fallback plan.

How did you decide between online or in-person application? What was the experience like for you?

#### Monitor Application Status
Once you submit, you can check the status online using your SSA account. Alternatively, you might get updates through the mail or by phone. Be patient because it often takes a few weeks to process.

Any tips or tricks for keeping yourself patient during this wait period? We could all use some stress-relief ideas here!

#### Important Considerations Before Applying
Timing is crucial. Starting social security benefits too early means you’ll get less monthly income compared to waiting until your full retirement age or even delaying till age 70. So, take a moment to assess your financial situation and think about when to pull the trigger.

When did you finally settle on your decision, and what factors influenced your choice? Any big realizations along the way?

### Conclusion
Making sense of Social Security can feel overwhelming, but breaking it down step by step makes it easier. Whether you decide to start benefits at full retirement age or hold off, having a clear plan can make all the difference as you approach those golden years. Utilize resources like the SSA’s online tools for better planning.

So, where are you in your journey to apply for Social Security? Share your experiences or ask any lingering questions below. Let’s chat and help each other out!

The spell was complete, and I brought it out to where we were tipped on a sighting of our cat. We found him, but he was not coming to us.

Ig most of my story is like other people only, however the timelines can be a bit different. 
Prep time taken:3.5 months
Started from scratch after entering into MSY3 as an img. Started first aid and along side system wise uworld and finished approximately 85% of it with an average of 61%, did not do a second pass or even looked into incorrect for that matter. 
I started giving nbmes like 25 days before the real deal
The first two thatIg gave were:
Nbme 25- 61%
26- 61%
That was without any revision and to check my base levels, took 5 days off, did review them thoroughly and did the mehlman msk + entire biochem( didn't even do it lol, was the first pass, micro) for 5 days and tested again gave:
Nbme 30 -72%
31-68%
Was feeling p confident so went outwithf my boyfriend for a short 1 day trip, yeah that's me lol, on 10th, I was supposed to give the test on 21.
The ig plan was to give uwsa1, uwsa2, free 120 and go give the exam 
I came and did free 120, got a 64, it was 12th, lost my fucking mind. Decided to do one question paper a day and got burnt out. Gave 
Nbme 29- 65%
Uwsa1 went soo bad I didn't even check my score honestly, 
Uwsa2-65% 
At this point I gave up and broke down 3 days before my exam, I remember crying for an entire day in front of my mother in a coffee shop and she trying to console me, I didn't know where I was going wrongoand I knew pushing it further would do no good as I already did whatever I could, gave it all of me. 
Decided to chill for a day and review whatever I did wrong, in that cafe only sipping on nice coffee and eating nice food, one hour at a time. 
Last exam I gave was 
Nbme 28-79.5% 
Could've been a fluke, I think I was just burnt out, a chill day and everything fell into place
Was planning to give another exam on the last day but decided not to idky, I'm happy I didn't. 
Exams p easy and yes there are longer questions and weird ones as well, but if you're clear w your concepts and fundamentals, no exam can beat you, skimming through it gives 90% of questions away. 
An advice to juniors would be to get done with this in the 2 nd year itself cuz it's an easy exam, it's fear mongering and self doubt that kills. Speaking this as an img from India doing mbbs from a government Institute in Delhi
It's more of a mental game that it is academically. 
Btw tested on 5/21

1l3ert8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l3ert8/hr_the_things_i_learned_while_stuck_in_a_time_loop/,[HR] The Things I Learned While Stuck in a Time Loop,"Most of us have seen *Groundhog Day*. Bill Murray gets stuck repeating the same day over and over until he learns to be a better person, charming enough to win over Andie MacDowell’s character. Great movie. What the movie doesn’t really focus on, though, is just *how long* Murray is stuck in that loop. He learns French, piano, and ice sculpting. All of those would take decades to master. You’ve got to admire the dedication, but when you repeat the same day over and over, it’s not like you have anything *better* to do.

I wish I could remember the first few days. The early decades are just noise, static in the back of my skull. If there was a first day, it’s gone now. But I’ll do my best.


I wake up at 7:15 a.m. That was my start time for the next 215 years. I’m supposed to be at a “work” event by 8, about half an hour away, so I’m already rushing. The quickest I’ve ever managed to wake up, get dressed, eat something, and get out the door was 4 minutes and 23 seconds. My drive takes exactly 19 minutes and 50 seconds if I avoid the speeding cameras and cops. On the first day, I wasn’t so quick, took me 15 minutes just to find clean pants. I arrived late, panicked, set up, and started playing.

By “work event,” I mean I was hired to play music at a local weekend market. My income was a bastard mix of Centrelink, odd jobs, and whatever strangers tossed in my guitar case. It’s not like I was rolling in cash. I played shitty covers for three hours, just loud enough to compete with the blender from the smoothie stall across the path. Then I had lunch and a coffee break. I tried every single food stall in existence during the loops, and the only genuinely decent one was a little Mexican joint in the corner of the field. The coffee onsite was garbage, but I found a good café about a five-minute sprint away. By the hundredth loop or so, I’d mastered the timing—I could grab my lunch and a decent long black and be back before my 15-minute break was over.

After that, I played another two hours and packed up. Then the rest of the day was mine. I can’t even remember how I spent it that first time. Maybe I went to the pub, maybe I just went home and doomscrolled. Either way, I’d eventually fall asleep.

Then it reset.

The first time it repeated, I thought it was déjà vu. The second time, I figured I’d just dreamed the previous day. By the fifth loop, I gave up on the market and just… did whatever. There were no consequences. I drank. I stole cars. Broke into people’s homes just to see what they were like inside. I joyrode down highways, ran red lights, did all the things you’d never do unless you were *absolutely* sure you’d get away with it.

And for a while, it was the most fun I’d ever had.

But fun decays. The thrill softens. Eventually, even anarchy becomes routine. So I pivoted. I decided I’d work through every movie I could ever have wanted to. I think I spent 50 years just watching movies. Which is funny, considering I don’t even remember half of them now. It’s not like I could take notes. I tried doing the same with TV shows, music, and books. I binged, absorbed, forgot, and repeated. I tried games too, but that was a mistake. Can’t save your progress when the day resets.

 

Eventually, I started picking up skills. Painting, cooking, writing, anything I could do within a 24-hour timeframe. I got *really* good at latte art for a while, even won a few barista competitions, unofficially, of course. I taught myself to draw photo-realistic portraits. Learned origami. Memorised entire books and then rewrote them with new endings. It wasn’t about meaning. It was about motion. About numbing the clock. Keeping my hands busy so my thoughts didn’t crawl out of my ears.

There’s a lot I wish I could’ve done. Travel. See the world. But even if I could permanently leave the city, I only had about $400 to my name. I once tried walking until I collapsed from exhaustion. Slept on a stranger’s lawn. Woke up in my bed.

The weirdest part? You still get tired. Not physically. Not even mentally in the usual sense. But spiritually. Like your soul starts grinding its teeth. You decay in place. You forget who you are, not all at once, but by attrition. Like your mind is being sanded down by repetition.

I’ve lived so many lifetimes in the same 24 hours, and the one thing I learned above all else is this: time doesn’t heal anything if it doesn’t move forward. You stay stuck. You replay grief, shame, boredom, every unwanted emotion, forever. You can’t evolve. You can’t forget. You just endure. I became an endless, powerless God.

 

I tested the boundaries of the loop. I pulled all-nighters to see if staying awake would let the day progress. It didn’t. As soon as 7:15 a.m. hit, I’d blink and wake up in bed. Still, I made the most of it. Sometimes I’d watch the sunrise just for the hell of it.

I played with influence. Tried saying the right combination of things to the right people. I made it as far as a meeting with the Secretary of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That took—I don’t know—thousands of loops? I delivered rehearsed speeches, memorised policy briefs, and rehearsed my charisma like it was a performance. But it never changed anything. At the end of the day, reset.

 

Eventually, like Murray, I tried to kill myself. Repeatedly. Sometimes dramatically. Sometimes grotesquely. Maybe I’m just a worse person than he was, but I gave up on morality early on. I stepped off overpasses. Drank bleach. Set myself on fire in a church. I hung myself from a traffic light outside my old high school just to see if the janitor would notice.

One time, I walked into a preschool and gutted myself in front of the kids. I remember blacking out with my intestines in my hands, blood pooling around my boots, hearing the shrieks of children still too young to process it. I woke up laughing.

There was this one guy, a stranger, who was just being released from a mental health facility, traumatised from seeing someone die. I spent an entire week killing myself in front of him. Made it worse each time. He didn’t remember, of course. No one ever did. So it’s okay. None of it mattered. Nothing could kill me. Nothing could change the day.

I became a museum of horror curated by my own boredom and withering sense of reality.

 

I began seeing things. At first, it was subtle,  shadows where there should have been none, a flicker of movement at the corner of my eye that vanished the moment I looked directly. Hallways seemed to stretch longer than they should, doorways framing nothing but darkness. Sometimes, reflections in windows or mirrors didn’t quite match my movements, a delayed blink, a smile that lingered too long.

I became convinced that a man was watching me on one of the days. I could feel his gaze like a weight on my back, cold and unyielding. No matter where I went, he was just beyond reach, lurking behind crowds, slipping into shadows.

He never spoke, but his presence was a constant, a slow poison that seeped into my skin. At night, when everything was silent and the world outside my window grew still, I’d lie awake, waiting to see him step through the door. But the door never opened.

Sometimes, I swear the world itself warped around him. The sky darkened a shade too deep, the air thickened, and a low hum thrummed through the walls, like the loop was breathing, watching, waiting. When I slept, voices whispered secrets I couldn’t understand, secrets about time, identity, and consequence.

 

And then, one day, it ended.

Time moved forward.

I don’t know how. It’s not like I did the right things in the right order or became a better person. I didn’t have an epiphany or reach enlightenment. It just... happened.

I stared at those changing numbers on my phone like they were written in ancient script. I hadn’t seen that time in centuries. And it hit me hard. I had no idea who I was anymore. I’d been so many versions of myself, tried on so many personalities, lived so many fragmented lifetimes that I forgot how to be someone. Or at least the person I was before all of this.

I forgot my birthday. I forgot my friends’ names. I had to relearn how to hold a conversation without knowing what the other person would say. How to plan. How to *wait*. How to live when things don’t reset.

 

The final lesson I was given by the loop:  
It’s that you don’t need eternity to become someone better.

You just need time that *hurts*.  
Time that *moves*.

I don’t know who I am anymore. Maybe that’s something I have to find out.

For now, all I can do is wait.

And see what time decides to do next.

Smelled Britney's **Fantasy** when it first came out (I'm an older Millennial), didn't like it, smelled Jlo's **Glo**, meh. Then recently changed my mind (whatever, you're allowed to be wrong).

Then someone here said Pure Honey was good and I got it (I've been in a ""honey phase"" the last few winters), and now I'm 5 celeb frags in, think I've almost had enough.... Or maybe not?

**Pure Honey (Kim Kardasian) 5.8** \- Actually great frag for the price. Smells just like those golden bars from Lush, and it lasts forever. A lil grandma-y, but not off-putting to me. The white florals are a bit much, but the bees wax and honey scent is carrying the team. Nothing complex, but good for mood uplifting.

**Sweet Like Candy (Ariana Grande) 6.8** \- Bought it because found it in a thrift store for $4. I thought it was ok at first, love the bottle though! After a few days I started loving it, and only wear it. It led me down a rabbit hole of candy smelling perfumes and oils, which I do not regret. I know these sweet scents are a bit one dimensional for some ppl, but I kind of get the hype after a few wears. It brings out a girly side of me that doesn't come out often.

Ok this is where I smelled someone that I *thought* was wearing **Baccarat Rouge 540** (something I dislike intensely, and all it's clones/family members, idk why the smell reminds me of public NYC bathrooms), but she said she was wearing **Cloud** by **Ariana Grande**. I was so turned off smelling it on her, I stopped being curious abt Ariana Grande perfumes for a while. Then I found 2 for super cheap and bought them as well.

**Thank U Next (Ariana Grande) 2.5** \- Gross, synthetic in a bad way. Not sure why this is a perfume or who wants to smell like this, but it is one of the worst perfumes in my collection.

**R.E.M (Ariana Grande) 7.4** \- Actually really enjoy this before bed time. This and **Green Tea** are my bed-time stories.

**Private Show (Britney Spears) 7.8** \- Ok at first I wasn't impressed, but after a few sprays and time, I've grown to really enjoy this. It's like if **Sweet Like Candy** lasted longer, less sweet but creamier. I do not smell any coffee, but I do smell sweet citrus, a lot of whipped cream, and heavy on the sugar.

Is there something else I should try before going back to never trying any celeb frags? I think I'm almost done with them, they are meh at best, **Private Show** might be as good as it's ever gonna get. Right?? ",2,1749065247.0,fragrance,10,0.6,False

To prove my point that this is actually a completely rational way to choose where to live, I built this handye [tool](https://econholic.shinyapps.io/CoffeeSlutApp/) that does exactly that.

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows which DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. I scraped Google reviews and Reddit posts about DC coffee shops in the past 12 months, then built a  text analysis model that  score how ""hipster"" each place is based on what people actually say about them. Covered 33+ shops as of now, but will be adding more soon!

The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Shaw or Georgetown. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area. 

Anyway, figured other people might want to use this to justify their housing decisions. Will drop the link if anyone's interested:

My phone is sadly overheating to the point where I have to go for a new one. I say sadly cause I really do not care about having the latest device, as long as the usages I want it for are being met.

That being said, Nothing looks promising, and with a lot of value per euro spent to offer.

The use cases I want my phone for are:

 \- Spending some time on youtube / insta, though not that much. I do like it to be snappy though  
 \- Gps for when I travel. I use a motorcycle, so there is some sun exposure.  
 \- Running android apps I develop, so the battery takes a toll on a daily basis  
 \- General usage such as using my banking app, ordering a coffee, some talking on the phone ect

With the above in mind, and keeping in mind I do not want to overspend for features I will not really use, such as a better camera, would going above the 2a model make sense?

I can find, brand new, the 2a (8GB/128GB) at 250 euros, whereas the 3a (12GB/256GB) for 330 euros.

I would pay for better battery, which the 3a seems to not have, and lack of overheating (though this should not be an issue at any of the 2)

We arranged to meet, but I had to reschedule because something came up. She replied a few days later saying she’s bad at replying but could do the following week.

We rebooked — on the day, I was literally about to leave to go meet her, and she messaged saying she went out the night before, just woke up, and wasn’t feeling great. She asked if we could rearrange. I said yes, no problem.

I asked if she still wanted to meet and when was good for her. She said:
“Yeah I do I’m just figuring out when’s best for me cause I’m busy next week again. Honestly I wasn’t doing anything now everything seems to be popping up.”

I said cool, just let me know.

1l3ef90,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1l3ef90/job_market_bet_hedging_advice/,Job market bet hedging [Advice],"As a recent grad. I’ve seen a fairly common mistake among my peers during their job search that is only going to get worse if the job market continues on its current trajectory. Not hedging bets and exploring careers paths. 

It was not uncommon for people to go all in on consulting or IB and completely strike out. This normally wouldn’t be an issue in a year with plenty of just in time recruiting opportunities, but the COVID job market is over. 

This starts relatively early. Everyone rushes to apply to consulting internships in the fall only to either not receive an interview or to not receive an offer post interview in January/February. At this point, most on campus recruiting applications have came and went… and the ones that are left are hyper competitive because everyone without an offer is in a mad rush to apply to what’s left making it ultra competitive. Making matters worse, many of the remaining options aren’t companies that have solid return offer pipelines.

This is repeated in the second year when people wait for the right opportunity that may never come in the current market. 

To remedy this, your best bet is to focus on your 2nd and 3rd options early and often. Take school provided coffee chats and set up time with companies you’re interested in. There were companies I had never imagined paid as well as they did and companies with jobs I never knew were so interesting beyond the surface level until speaking to F500 LDPs, general management programs, etc. For every 2-3 consulting or IB coffee chats you should aim to hedge with at least 1 in another industry that has a history of MBA recruiting. This also builds room for full time recruiting if you decide you don’t like your summer employer.

I used this strategy during a particularly tough year for consulting recruiting. I ended up with 5 job offers as a result across F500, big tech, and LDP programs despite striking out at consulting. Many of these roles were typical consulting exit opportunities or were industry favored tracks to upper management. It also gave me a multiple offer situation I used to bump my salary at the company I finally took a full time role at. 

Tactically, this doesn’t mean spray and pray job applications to every company you see. You should be hyper specific in tailoring your resume, recruiting, and interviewing. These jobs are also extremely selective and shouldn’t be waived off as shoe ins for a top MBA. Many people had this mentality and it led to 0 offers. You should be reading company 10-Ks, following their news, looking for the unique value you can provide and how you can angle your experiences for the role, etc. Being smart and following the check the box steps to achieve consulting is far more straightforward. Companies that operate in industry expect curiosity, genuine interest, and just as much preparation as any consulting/IB gig. 

If for nothing else, you may find yourself in a role that is a better fit for you by exploring other options and displaying broader industry interests.

1l3edn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1l3edn1/looking_for_a_grinder_for_americano_and_moka_pot/,Looking for a grinder for Americano and Moka pot coffee maker - electric or manual?,"Hi! I'm not a barista, I just like plain, good American, black bitter coffee. Until now, for years I've been using a cheap Ikea blade grinder and a Bialetti Venus moka pot coffee maker.

I recently fell in love with a coffee made with an electric burr grinder and the piston espresso machine so I though I'd go ahead and buy a combined machine with a grinder. But I quickly realized I don't need a piston espresso machine if I only drink Americano, as with their 15 BAR they are meant for espresso, so I decided to stay with my Bialetti Venus and get myself a decent but cheap-ish (max $150) coffee grinder.

Questions:

1. does it make sense to replace the blade grinder with a burr grinder at all
2. for Americano coffee, is manual grinder going to be just as good as electric? I like simplicity so there's part of me wanting the manual one, so I was thinking about Timemore C3, but is it going to be well suited for Americano? For electric I was thinking about sth like Graef CM80",1,1749064645.0,barista,0,1.0,False

1. Can you over tamp? I don't mean to many times, but can you push to hard and make the puck too dense? Would this affect espresso volume or would the unit want you to change the grind setting? Obviously consistency (the same every time)  is important too.
2. Old beans - for drip coffee, I buy a few pounds at time, each in its own ""sealed"" bag. Besides flavor, is there any reason not to use this for espresso?
3.  The overflow tray - how often should it fill? I know there is some kind of cleaning cycle happening, but there is no indication on what to expect, except when the tray is full. 

I have another post where I am having problems with water volume during brewing, but I wonder if these things could have an affect. I know that grind size will affect the flow through the grounds, but what else might?",1,1749064592.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,1,1.0,False

1l3eb3q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3eb3q,First Smoke on OCB Gravity,"As an update to my previous post. Did a no wrap rib this week and while it was not perfect, I'm happy with the first use. Held temp like a champ and got plenty of smoke. Did a no wrap method using a combination of Jeremy Yoder and Aaron Franklin's instruction. Oak chunks with Jealous Devil briquetes.

The Method:
1) Seasoned with 2:1 ratio of pepper and salt (a bit of coffee in there which I may increase in the future)
2) 3 hours at 225
3) 1 hour with a spritz every 15 minutes
4) 1 hour a 275 with a sprits every 20 minutes
5) Wrapped in paper with smoked manteca I had (previously used for carnitas). Brought to internal of 207.

I glazed 2 racks and kept 1 dry. Using Franklin's Fig Ancho sauce (highly recommend).

Lessons Learned:
-Too Salty! Needee to cut back on the seasoing and account for the manteca being salty.
- The ribs were at room temp when I added them, but, after putting the meat on, the temp took way too long to come back up. I will set the temp high for the initial heat up in the future and also give it another 20 minutes for the smoker to stabilize before adding food. 
- The spritz bark got a little overdone in spots. Need to rotate the meat more to avoid hot spots. Part of that is me learning the machine.
-I had juice in the spritz (25/25/50 of Apple Cider Vin/Cherry Juice/water) which didn't add much flavor. The juice probably contributed to some of the crunchy spots. But didn't add enough to justify.

Disclaimer for what I’m about to say, I’m a touch neurodivergent and I’ve always been a little closed minded about flavor mixing. Like my husband eats pretzels and milk at the same time and I think that’s so strange, I refuse to drink orange juice with sweet breakfast like pancakes, that kind of thing. So this might just be a me thing, idk.

I feel like it’s pretty obvious that some flavors (cupcake, vanilla, caramel, etc) are good for the coffee drinks and some flavors (all the fruits) are good for the energy drinks. What I can’t figure out is how to order the flavors that are kind of in the middle, like the cobbler flavors. It just doesn’t sound quite right as a coffee or an energy to me.

Give me all your recs for flavors that are a blend of the fruity and rich sweet flavors, and how you order them. I really want to try them!

I’m also trying to wrap my head around the energy drinks with cream, it seems weird to me so I’ve yet to try it. Give me recs for those too!

With its rich cultures, diverse landscapes, affordable cost of living, and increasing internet infrastructure, it's no surprise that many countries across the continent are launching visa programs to attract remote workers.[ More about Digital Nomad Visas:](https://digitalnomadroutes.com/)

In this guide, we explore which countries in South America currently offer digital nomad visas, the requirements, and what makes each destination unique.

# 🇧🇷 Brazil – Digital Nomad Visa (VITEM XIV)

**Application Requirements:**

* Proof of remote work or freelance income for a foreign employer
* Health insurance valid in Brazil
* Criminal background check

# 🇨🇴 Colombia – Digital Nomad Visa (Visa V)

**Launched:** October 2022  
**Visa Duration:** Up to 2 years  
**Minimum Income:** USD $684/month  
**Application Requirements:**

* Proof of employment or freelance contract with a foreign company
* Letter of motivation for living in Colombia

**Why Colombia?**  
With Medellín dubbed the ""Silicon Valley of South America,"" Colombia has become a hotspot for nomads. Affordable rent, modern coworking spaces, and eternal spring weather make it a favorite.

# 🇺🇾 Uruguay – Temporary Residency for Remote Workers

**Launched:** 2023  
**Visa Duration:** 6 months (extendable to 1 year)  
**Minimum Income:** Not explicitly stated (must demonstrate financial solvency)  
**Application Requirements:**

* Proof of remote work
* Declaration of health coverage
* Clean criminal record
* No job offer from a Uruguayan company

**Why Uruguay?**  
Montevideo is calm, safe, and stable, with decent Wi-Fi and public services. Uruguay also offers a favorable tax environment for foreigners staying under 183 days a year.

# 🇦🇷 Argentina – Planned Digital Nomad Visa

**Status:** Announced but not fully implemented (as of mid-2025)  
**Visa Duration:** TBD  
**Minimum Income:** TBD  
**What’s Known So Far:**

* Argentina has proposed a visa for freelancers and foreign-employed workers
* Buenos Aires has launched a ""Digital Nomads BA"" program with perks

**Why Argentina?**  
Despite economic fluctuations, Argentina offers an exciting mix of European-style cities, Patagonia’s wild beauty, and strong coffee-shop work culture. Buenos Aires in particular is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Latin America.

# 🇪🇨 Ecuador – Digital Nomad Visa (Rentista for Remote Workers)

**Launched:** 2022  
**Visa Duration:** Up to 2 years  
**Minimum Income:** USD $1,275/month (3x Ecuador’s minimum wage)

**Why Ecuador?**

# 🇨🇱 Chile – No Official Digital Nomad Visa (Yet)

While Chile does not have a specific digital nomad visa, many remote workers use the **Temporary Resident Visa (for Independent Workers)** or **tourist visa extensions** to stay long-term.

**Why Chile?**  
Santiago offers modern infrastructure, Patagonia offers nature, and Valparaíso offers charm. Plus, Chile has one of the most stable economies in the region and fast internet in urban areas.

# 🇵🇪 Peru – No Digital Nomad Visa (as of 2025)

Peru offers **183-day tourist visas**, which many digital nomads use. However, you cannot legally work for a Peruvian company on this visa. There are rumors of remote work-friendly visa discussions, but nothing is confirmed.

**Why Peru?**  
For adventurous nomads, Peru’s mystical energy (think Machu Picchu), incredible cuisine, and affordability are irresistible. Lima has a growing coworking scene, and Cusco attracts nature-loving freelancers.

# 🇵🇾 Paraguay – Freelance and Self-Employed Residency Options

Paraguay does not offer a digital nomad visa per se, but **residency by deposit** or **freelancer residency** options are common among expats.

**Requirements:**

* Deposit \~$5,000 in a Paraguayan bank
* Clean criminal record
* Proof of self-employment or income

**Why Paraguay?**  
As a lesser-known destination, Paraguay offers low living costs, light regulation, and friendly locals. It’s especially appealing for long-term expats or digital nomads looking for residency, not tourism.

# 🧭 Choosing the Right Country: Key Considerations

When selecting a South American country to live and work in as a digital nomad, keep these in mind:

* **Internet Speed:** Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina offer the fastest and most reliable internet.
* **Cost of Living:** Paraguay, Colombia, and Ecuador are among the most affordable.
* **Safety:** Uruguay, Chile, and parts of Argentina are generally safer.
* **Visa Duration:** Colombia and Ecuador offer the most generous timelines.
* **Language:** Spanish or Portuguese is essential in most regions, although English is growing in urban centers.

I plan on taking about a week-long trip this summer from South Florida, probably in the first week of July, to Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana. As of now, I have nothing concrete but was thinking of flying into SLC for a couple days and then driving to Idaho for a couple before flying to either Wyoming or Montana since both seem too far to drive to alone on what I suspect would be steep, mountainous terrain. 

I'm almost done with a goal to run in all fifty states, and since I'll be in the area, I absolutely want to visit all four of these states. Theoretically, it doesn't matter where I go in each state as long as I run there, but if I'm traveling, I'd prefer to go someplace good, not just the middle of nowhere. So my very longwinded questions are, should Boise be my Idaho destination? And is my proposed order of visiting states the most logical way to go? 

A few Google searches have shown it's about a 4.5 hour drive from SLC, which I feel totally fine making by myself, but I also see it's a bit into Idaho. I was thinking my two choices were to drive to Boise and then fly to Casper (based on nothing other than googling coffee and beer in Wyoming) and figure out the Montana part or just drive somewhere in Idaho not as far from SLC, run, and then head back to SLC to fly to the other states or if, since I wouldn't have traveled as far into Idaho, it would be close enough to drive instead of fly to the other states. 

Is it worth it to make the drive to Boise? Breweries, coffee shops, running, and vegan food are all on my list of important things. And wherever I end up, can anybody recommend some great places to run?

It is always an unpleasant task to be a Debbie Downer about the state of reality these days. It's like crafting a shite sandwich, then putting it on the table for everyone to take a bite. No one needs to be told just how horrific things have become in our time; and for years and years now.

The above was about 1954. Long time ago. Most of us weren't even born yet. Since 1947/48, and while the world was restarting after a 6 year long world war, the worst nephies in power were already doing everything in their power to enslave and create artificial realities for the world to

* consume,
* identify with,
* become passionate over,
* believe in,
* fight for, and
* die for.

All of it fictions. The music was intentionally slid down into the lowest forms. Thumping beats of bass and drums, mostly to engage the simple minded and easily enslaved. Repeating patterns of catchy hooks and riffs. With a soulful voice at first; then to mere grunted phrases and soulless “divas” whose voices are hopelessly average in the extreme. From this and with this, jingoistic phrases, to march for or against, depending.

Labels became the thing. Started in the 1990s. Boomer, Gen X, Gen Y, Zoomers, Millenials – making it easier to split families up along identity lines, handed to them and shoved down their throats a hundred times a day. Now grandpa is hated, because he is a “boomer” and for no other reason than that. And the world happily swallowed it. Since the days of Mae West, Garbo, and others (1920s), they have put men in women's makeup and clothes to fool the world with their satanic modalities.

It's a flat fact that movies were created for the express purpose of sending subtle political struggles deep into the psyche of the viewer, so that the more overt political agenda emerging from Washington would be supported. Director John Ford routinely and openly admitted that his westerns were DESIGNED ON PURPOSE to both influence and create affinities for WW2, Korea, and the upcoming Vietnam war. Warner Bros were/are big on propaganda films, to influence the emotions and sentiments of the world, to embrace a struggle that was wholly a setup. Like CASABLANCA, African Queen, or any John Wayne western after 1938. All the major studios worked with the Pentagon on films. All the while also designing guilt into them, so anyone not on board with the latest agenda was an outcast and was unAmerican...or unBritish, et al. The movie *Rio Grand* *1950* was specifically made to sell the moral obligation to fight a foreign war – the Korean War – to Americans. Wayne and Ford, both said so, the star and director.

All the while, our moral foundation was being intentionally eroded, year by year, song by song, movie by movie, until we – the world – had slid downward into murdering our children for an easier life, becoming wholly self absorbed, and nihilistic. I remember the 1960s. I ought to, I grew up in that time.

* Tune in, turn on, drop out. (quit life, do drugs)
* If it feels good, do it. *(feeling good is good enough*, was the saying then)
* If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you are with.
* Don't be square, grow your hair like a girl. (you had to, because the girls wouldn't even look at you, openly calling you square, not hip, uncool. What chance does a teenager have against that?)

The selfie craze that has only grown with the coven sluts, and has taken over those easily led into satanic ways and doings.

The use of *pyschic driving* (repeating a thing over and over until it became the fabric of the lower, uninspired mind) in commercials, music, movies, TV became the standard.

The CIA created NASA (Hebrew, *to deceive*) to erase flat earth, the firmament, and heaven above with hoaky stop motion animation of the 1960s and onto the lying astronots who would, to a man, not put their hand on the Holy Word and swear by their souls, they did these things for real. Hundreds of hours of video proof that the NASA fictions were fictions and still they push the agenda for the weak minded and mentally challenged whom refuse to consider and think, but just accept ANYTHING they are told as factual because...authority and “I saw it on TV.”

There are entire teams of demonic group think agendas pushed routinely on any public forum. It's why they created these forums. To control the narrative, push fake events and agendas (Sandy Hoax was a total fake out; as was the Boston bombing, et al) with crisis actors from coven/CIA/FBI/NSA operatives. Usually, behind it all, jewish creators of porn, filth, the fake events and the agendas for the world to swallow, while they silently hyper inflate everyone eventually into poverty, hopelessness, and despair.

Outliers were and are, targeted. Gangstalking, poverty, attacks both within the family and without, all the while making it plausibly deniable so that when such targeted souls speak of these things happening to them, those doing it just smile in a patronizing way and roll their eyes; all to cue. Soul crushing isolation and grief became the modality for these kind, strong enough to survive it all – barely.

I haven't even started yet.

By the early 1970s they created the vaccines – the vax weapons. To destroy us from within. Many of these are binary weapons; meaning, once in the system, it only needs yet another chemical or frequency to activate its deeper agenda. Diabetes, various diseases, cancers, etc. They created the “virus hoax.” You cannot see it or isolate it, but they “know it's there.” And we trusted them with these hoaxes because it was IN OUR SCHOOL BOOKS. Our teachers told us it was true; by 1966, there were globes in every classroom in the west. When I was in school, every science class had 2 views of the flat earth maps our teachers taught from, as well as the globe. Those maps are NOT to be found in class rooms since the early 1980s. FACT.

We never had a chance. Really.

One way or another, they were shaping how we perceived reality with their agenda and that was to make double sure that a “God above” was completely removed from the mind as something akin to believing in the easter bunny. They took over the real churches, planted wizards and sorcerers as pastors and priests, and raped the children and taught false doctrine. No stone was left unturned. And the Jesuits behind most of it had been hard at work for many centuries, creating the framework that is what we call reality now in our times.

I could go point by point illustrating these truths and have, over the years, done so.

While all the above was and is going on, they weaponized with their own “hate speech” entire groups of peoples, one against the other. Blacks against whites, Muslims against Christians, jewbies against all mankind. It's in the music, online topics, and painful to watch videos of people failing at life and being shot down by zog bots eager to “stay safe” while putting fat dykes into uniform whom can only be angry bitches, when they sense they have the upper hand in a situation. All these thugs have glocks. Where do they come from? Who brings them in and sells them to inner city and dumbed down people? Why are there NO arrests for this tens of thousands of guns that come into every single city in the west, every single day? They want to ban guns, but whom is bringing them into the cities and selling them to thugs? No one, anywhere, ever mentions this fact.

No one anywhere, stops it. WHY?

Because they want it this way. *They want idiots with guns taking their ephemeral happiness at gunpoint and the thugs like the Adrenalin rush killing gives them.* It becomes the ultimate drug, better than dope. And we tiptoe around, looking over our shoulder or out in the parking lot, to see if thugs are there, ready to kill for a cellphone or a couple of bucks and your car.

While all this is distracting us, watching our destroyed economy going overseas, year by year, until it is all there – and it is now – and we are left with nothing to look forward to. Ever again. Like it is now. They are very busy. Busy indeed.

CYM pics

Creating entire cities underground, with tunnel systems, vast networks of stores and adrenochrome harvesting of the some 8 million trafficked children a year under USAF bases and the like. There is so much DUMB stuff beneath our feet that you cannot drive anywhere more than twenty minutes, in any direction, where you are not over something ugly. What is beneath us is so unholy and demonic that the sheer magnitude of it all takes my breath away. I had/have the Phil Schneider maps of DUMBS from the early 1990s. There was about a dozen; even then, one was in Tehachapi. And this stuff was put in during the 1950s and 60s. Long time now. But it was a lie, to sell aliens. In that the real number and its real purposes of these DUMBS, he never mentioned. He gave over a little truth, to sell a Great Lie – the alien agenda. There are more than a thousand in the USA alone. Even little 8 mile wide Ojai, Calif has a DUMB on each end, one that was built by lake casitas in 2002/3, which I reported on at the time. What goes on in these places is beyond description to the mind of mankind. And the smell is awful, given the creatures and people that populate these places.

And now we have, what they have been working on since the 1950s, trans humanism creations, that can and are inhabited by demons that can mimic any person, any sound, and train of thought, empowered by satan himself. These have moved from below ground, to above ground. The demons don't like sunlight, so they prefer a chemtrailed sky to function in the daytime, or they must stay indoors until night falls. The whole silicone vs carbon reality. And it is quite real, decades ahead of what they admit.

Each generation of the damned, the coven families, is worse than the one that preceded it. Far worse. They get the satanic ritual abuse and psychic driving and Mkultra, Super Soldier training too, but unlike previous iterations, these new kind of the last 40 years and every year since instantly takes to it with eagerness and alacrity. I've never seen anything like it before. I cannot describe to you how bloody awful and evil these souls are, coming in since 2000. They are literally the darkness reaching out for the darkness.

Well gee, Don, what now? Thanks for ruining my day or at least the last 20 minutes of my life; thank you very much...*asshole*.

I know. I wake up with what I've seen the previous night and if I were a drinking man, would be reaching for the bottle first thing. Before coffee. Awareness doesn't make it in the least bit palatable. You think the above is bad? How about this one, then.

***When the restrainer stands up, Total War against mankind will be permitted.***

All I did was synopsize the realities I have been trying to inform the world about for a very long time now. And I left out a great many because it would take about 20 pages to state each aspect point in a minor way. That's just a MINOR WAY.

We already have more than 43% of the weak minded west vax weaponized. You can take an older cell phone or blue tooth scanner to any group and scan it and see for yourself. If you have the guts to do so. I did. I even went to graveyards with my scanners and all the fresh graves that weren't cremations pinged with a MAC code. The weapon killed them. It is still killing them, by the thousands every single day. Every single day the sun rises, in the previous 24 hours some 3 to 4 thousand people, somewhere in the vax weaponized world, fell dead as Dillinger. Those that still walk around have a death sentence they know they have, but ignore and pretend to pretend that it will never happen to them, until it does.

**They ALL have the Mark of the Beast. ALL OF THEM. The walking dead.**

Dare I mention that graphene oxide is on or in all foods and many liquid products have the vax weapon? Everything sold in ANY market has been sprayed with graphene oxide or made with it during manufacture. The meats and dairy have the vax weapon. Nice huh?

All fast food not only has the weapon and graphene oxide but the bodies of all those 8 million children have been put into the hamburger meat, sausages, and chicken nuggets. Even the meat isn't meat anymore. It's tumor meat, fast grown in labs that wholly resembles real meat, except for subtle changes I've well covered in the last several years. Even the seafood I've purchased was fake; it wasn't even real fish, but some kind of plastic, something.

Dare I go on?

I could. But, as is usually the case, by this time in writing and I have been at for an hour and a half now, I am sick and mournful, too. At this point, I want to draw the weapon of FIRE and start making things right, count the cost later. I've been very close to that many times. Especially when they do what they do and shove it in my face. Even two days ago, the little lake I visit, had these six foot long sticks at the water's edge. When I went to pick them up, all the ducks flew into the water. I instantly saw what had happened there, the day before. These sick bastards had got themselves sticks, ran into the sealed zone and swung it at the ducks and geese, to hurt the thing I love. *To hurt me.* I wanted at that moment to WASTE THEM ALL. Not because of their attack on me, but those sweet innocent birds. It took me a few minutes to calm down and just seal their homes and a few famous people, like Peter Thiel and the like. I go High and Low now, because that is the PRICE when you bring it to my door. That Instant. Not later, then and there. That kind of labor is RARELY rescinded. If the satanic network cannot keep their people in line, that's their problem. And the idiots quite forgot that Eduardo already put a curse on anyone doing such things, their walk and way is forever cursed; they quickly wonder what fell on them and why it is all going WRONG.

Right Elon?

The thing is, like you, all the above weighs on my heart and soul. To even write this up brings a grief to my soul I cannot begin to express to you all. Really.

All we have, now, any longer, any where, anyhow, is our soul. Or what's left of it. I gave mine to Christ Yeshua on December 16^(th), 1975 and since. It's all I have. My heart. It's all I can give to Him whom I love with all I am. More than myself. For I have given myself to serve mankind and for a very long time now. Very long time. And none of it matters. Not in heaven or on Earth.

I labor on. Do what I can. Teach, educate, make aware. Fight evil when the fight is on and try to eek out a few minutes in the sun with Him, walking with me. A good meal, once in awhile. A night filled with horrors beyond description as yet more of their doings are revealed to me. Or some event to take place in my life, yet in the future. I usually awaken agog. My mind freaking out over the doings and seeings of the night just past. Sometimes, it is so very horrible I try to remember all the details for the knowing of it, but also, at the same time, wish it all away so I can manage functioning in the day just coming. It is a very strange thing to be me, most of the time. Most people I run into think I am judging them on sight, especially here in Tehachapi, a total coven place. Not so. ***I do not judge you. Don't even care. Yeshua handles judgment,*** I don't bother about that. You want to cast spells, no one stops you or hinders you. I don't. I treat everyone with a sincere smile and greeting, unless they are purposely bracing me in public for some kind of reconnaissance or other viciousness. That's on them, not me.

There is always the VFW. Go in, tie one on, blather about my problems to anyone who will listen. In my case, it wouldn't be sympathy, but smiles at my “suffering.”

But Don, don't you have Christ and Our Father?

Of course. How do you think I made it this far and retained what little sanity I have left? It's how I can manage an easy smile for one and all, regardless of their spiritual estate. Yeshua, the Right Hand of Almighty YHVH is the VERY REASON I can even do anything. I would have been a drug overdose a long time ago, had They not become so fully all that is remaining within me. That's a fact.

How He manages to keep me together I will never know. Seems impossible to me, yet here I am, still alive, still doing, still fighting the good fight, pointless to me in the extreme, save for His Glory, not mine.

Nothing I do matters. I know this. Matters not a whit. There is no job well done, only the work to be done. That's it. Until it is not. That's it.

You'd think all this would be cathartic, good to get off of one's soul, but it never is. It only anchors the ugly deeper within, sad to say.

Would you expect me to lie and sugar coat all this as happy camper ways and means? I cannot be false with you or myself, in such a fashion. Others do. Others lie. A lot. Every true soul of Christ feels as I do, even if you cannot see it. We are so done with all this shite. Really. All of us. If we are being honest. Behind all my smiles and warm greetings lies a deep inner grief that is the size of Texas. I am being most serious and earnest in saying that.

Don

1l3dxvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3dxvd/i_was_hired_to_maintain_an_old_mans_farm_property/,I Was Hired to Maintain an Old Man’s Farm Property,"	In 1973 I had just made my way out of high school and into an entirely unforgiving world. One which had no interest in supporting my needs. Without parents, who had long separated and abandoned their lives, and no discernible skills to set myself apart, money came slow. I lived under the heel of one Mr. Harrison Furgen, ruler of the desolate and depressing cafe establishment, Furgen’s Mug. Being one of many such institutions in our city streets, dust fell over unused booths while the coffee makers hydrated no one but Mr. Furgen and myself. Simply looking at the store’s exterior might entirely suck the life right out of you. For my shifts, consisting of only staring out a window into the street and occasionally sweeping a boot-printless tile floor, the abysmal pay of 50 cents an hour may have been appropriate, ignoring how legal it may have been. I used to ponder, during my banal work, how Mr. Furgen could possibly afford to keep the shop open all these years. I concluded I was likely contributing to a money laundering operation. 

	It was one day in the middle of  June when through the smouldering city streets, filled with factory smog created by the mass underpaid labour that defined this county, a man appeared. I believe I was asleep sitting at the counter with my head hunched down as I usually was when the unfamiliar jingle of the cafe’s door echoed through the silent establishment. 
“Hello sir, how’s it going today?”
	He was a completely unassuming elderly man, normal and charming in every sense. At what I would have guessed to be around 70 years old, he stood slightly hunched but on his own. Walking slowly with the gate of one just happy to be alive. Circular spectacles sat upon his round nose and rosy cheeks, too large for his face and magnifying his eyes slightly under the power of their prescription. His head very slightly nodding up and down with the shakiness of an elderly. He seemed to glint under the light of the smoke-shrouded sunrise as he removed his hat to let out his thinning hair . He took off his jacket to take a seat in front of me. 
	“Oh, I’m doing just fine son, and how are you? Shop doesn’t seem awfully busy; am I all you’ve served this morning?”
	“This must be your first time here sir, you’ve got to be the first customer in three days.” I said with an awkward chuckle.
	He laughed back. “Why do you bother comin’ in if there’s no one here lad? If I may ask.”
	I observed how his smile was so welcoming and kind. It radiated the simple joy of someone in love with people, and the conversation at hand. Like no matter what you said next, he would earnestly care. Inviting, is how I’d describe it I guess. 
“Well I just need it sir, not much I can do ya’ see.”
“Surely you don’t own such a shop at your young age son?”
I snickered at the thought I’d ever make it that far in life.
	“No, no. I do believe I’m the only employee though. I’m surprised Mr. Furgen can even afford to pay me anymore.” Adding “Not that he really does,” under my breath.
	As he laughed, the man adjusted his glasses and said, “Indeed it’s a tough world right now. So many people with nothing to do I’m afraid. But it’s going to be alright, we all just have to remember that son.”
“Of course, sir.”
“No need to call me sir young man, the name’s Albert Seamore.”
“Nathan Wesley. What can I get for you, Mr. Seamore?”
	He ordered a small brew of coffee with more milk, cream, and sugar than one would expect from a man his age. I turned away to begin fulfilling his order and a calming pause in conversation fell upon Furgen’s coffee, accented by the quiet hum of machinery and whispers of the morning radio. 
	“Ya’ know son, if you’re looking for a better job than this one I can help you out.”
	“Well I’ll take whatever I can get Mr. Seamore. The truth is my shifts aren’t all that exciting, and the pay certainly isn’t any better, believe it or not.”
	He chuckled at my attempt at humour and I found myself laughing along with him as I made his drink.
	“Well you see I own a small bit of land up north out of the city. I’ve been living there alone but as I get older I find I’m unable to maintain it. Hard work supporting even the smallest farms with a back like mine. It’s a lovely place though son, old house that creaks with each step, but it’s home. I could use some help if you’re interested, lad.”
	I was shocked. The only customer in days walks in and just offers me an escape from this deathly mundane job and the city’s reek of burning labour. I stopped my work and turned to him. “Oh well, that’s quite kind of you Mr. Seamore sir…I- I frankly am not sure what to say.” He smiled as I collected my next words, welcoming any response at all. “I mean, h- how far is it? Where would I stay?”
	“Oh it’s about an hour drive up north once the city ends and becomes the farm and woodland. But, no worries son, I’ve got a comfortable guest room you can stay in and fit to your sort while you’re there on the job. Of course there’s no pressure at all, son. Just thought a young lad like you might appreciate the quiet and the pay. It’s a- it’s a peaceful life up there ya’ know.”
	At this point I was convinced it was God that walked into the shop that morning.
	For another half hour the two of us discussed what tasks I would be assigned to do around his property. His explanations painted a soothing picture of quaint farm life where my only concerns would be mowing lawns, tilling soil, sweeping floors, etc. I began to think of it as a great pause in my life. For two summer months I would be fed and housed, away from the world, and I would miss nothing. I could catch up in life, get on my feet, and only once I was ready to return would the world keep spinning.
	As he left, we parted with the agreement to write me a letter with further information within the next few days, and a firm handshake. For the first time in years I was hopeful. I did not hesitate to leave my rat filled moldy apartment and severe absence of human connection when Mr. Albert Seamore’s letter arrived the following week.
To my dearest future caretaker, Nathan Wesley:
Hello Mr. Wesley, I pray this letter arrives without delay and finds you well and as eager to start this next chapter as you were the other day. If you still are of course, you’re free to arrive anytime from June 28th to August 1st. You’re all prepared for your living, however I wasn’t certain about some of your preferences so we can settle some things once you arrive. I want you to be as comfortable as possible. Specifically, I did not know if you prefer silk or cotton sheets so I bought both. Do not worry about your first days being hard, I’ll show you around and introduce the basic aspects of your duties, so you can be comfortable. As for directions…
	The letter continues on describing a convoluted twisting path through a hundred miles of woods. 

	Without a car, I took a taxi and, to the begrudging driver, I read the disorienting instructions as we went further down our hour-long journey. I’m sure Mr. Seamore would have gladly picked me up and driven back, but I felt guilty at how accommodating he had been already. After several wrong turns and a close call with a deer, a stone and wood house began to peek out from between the trees. The now miserable driver dropped me off to walk the last stretch.
	As I descended the small gravel road, carrying two suitcases of what little possessions I had, making the last gradual turn before my destination, it was then, the property of Mr. Albert Seamore opened up to me. 
	The two-story residence of Mr. Seamore appeared as a thousand year old relic of a simpler time. Crafted of logs and cobblestone, the structure appeared to have been expanded upon dozens of times throughout the years it stood. Sections of differing material jutted off in unnatural directions that surely called the structural integrity of the house into question. I could only imagine the inside was a maze of unnatural hallways, curving, raising and lowering in all manners of an unprofessionally modded home. Of course I would come to find I was right. 
	I was wondering what Mr. Seamore could have needed so much room for when the front door creaked open inwards and the torn screen door creaked open outwards. 
	“Nathan, it’s good to see you! I’m glad you decided to come, my boy. How was the journey up here.”
	“Hey, Mr. Seamore. It’s nice to see you too. It was uh…good.” I said nervously.
	“Oh no need for formalities son. I want you to be comfortable here. Call me Albert.” His infectious smile had made its way to me now.
	“Oh-oh. Of course.” Of course, my reciprocal grin was awfully awkward.
	I explained my turbulent journey north and as I predicted, Mr. Seamore said I should have just written to him and he would have gladly picked me up all the way from the city. In the first week I knew the man, he was only ever accommodating, respectful, and contagiously joyous. 

	He showed me to my small quarters first, leading me through cramped hallways of varying floral wallpapers, quaint living rooms filled with hand crafted furniture and various assortments of trinkets collected over a lifetime, and a humble dining room. Small table accompanied by two seats and decorated dishes. I did not however notice any photos throughout the house. Only meaningless abstract paintings on the walls.
	My bedroom consisted only of a small single bed and a nightstand, a lamp on top and a small storage space behind a panel in the wall. I decided to leave my cigarettes there. Mr. Seamore had clearly made an effort to suit the quarters as best he could to my unfamiliar young self, based only on our limited interactions. Two sets of sheets were folded at the foot of the bed, and various posters of relevant rock bands adorned the walls. Personally I didn’t care for Lynyrd Skynyrd, but it was the thought that counted I guess. If anything I appreciated such unnecessary effort to connect and make me comfortable.	
	My duties were simple. Rake leaves, till soil, mow the lawn. Any task too laborious for an old gentleman like Mr. Seamore; I would have done. Under the baking sun, clothes sticking to my skin as they soaked my sweat, I would look out over the heat haze on the corn field to think about how lucky I was for the change. 
	Most days Mr. Seamore was gone doing whatever activities he was still able to, out in the city. Whenever asked about his daytime goings he would reply along the lines of: “Oh I just enjoy the walking. It’s all I can do anymore son.”
	One might think the monotony of the labour, ever the same vista, and one man for company would begin to grind away at me as I grew sick of apathy. However, when you spend years of your life working in Fergun’s Mug, boredom is impossible. I suspect that Mr. Seamore, on the other hand, had long grown tired of the routine, and really just needed me as company in his lonely existence. I sometimes wondered how he kept such a jolly attitude cooped up in his labyrinth of a home before I came along. In fact, I often wondered what went on in such a place before myself.
	Rarely in my first week would I encounter anomalies in my work. It was only on the morning of my eighth day when I remarked a swarm of flies gathering above a patch of crop. 
	“Weird.” I thought. 
	In moments of suspense the howling wind changes from comforting white noise, to an eerie tunnel pulling you towards the unknown. And pull it did, as I creeped towards the dark between the wheat. Where had the sound of the birds gone? Finally, I brushed away the small swarm and patted my way across the surrounding dirt. I didn’t find anything. I didn’t smell anything. And I continued my work.

	On the tenth day I was cleaning the interior of the house when I realized I had not yet cared for Mr. Seamore’s master bedroom, though of course ‘master’ is a highly exaggerated description for the room. It was hardly larger than my own, and seemed to be located at a cross section of multiple renovations on the home. As an unnatural four sided shaped room, the old man’s bed did not sit flush with the wall. One wall was red brick, the other shambled wood, and the other two drywall. Frankly, it was a much worse room than the one that I was residing in. I guessed that Mr. Seamore was much too humble. Noticing scratches and general dust on his ancient hardwood floor, I decided to do the man a favour and sweep up, surprising him with a refurbished chamber not on the list of my tasks for the day. He at least deserved a comfortable sleep.
	A gentle breeze flew through unseen gaps in the architecture as I gently worked away. After a few minutes and a quick brush beneath the shadow of his bed, a small black square drifted out with the debris. Picking it up, I realized a single exposure, cut out from a roll of film I presumed, was between my fingers. In the transparent dark red impression I made out a man resembling a slightly younger Albert Seamore, standing with his arm around the shoulder of a similarly aged woman, and behind a young girl of what I guessed to be 3 or 4 years old. I was highly surprised at the discovery of what was likely Mr. Seamore’s family. Something about his living arrangement implied he hadn’t been close to anyone in his life. “What happened to them?” I wondered as I put the photo back in its shroud of darkness, noting the old man’s unfamiliar lack of warmth. 
	Later that night Mr. Seamore pulled into the gravel driveway followed by a cloud of dust.
	“Hey, son, I noticed my uh- my room was extra tidy today. Did you-“
	“Oh yes. I just had extra time and thought I’d do you something nice, that’s all.” I smiled
	I remember in that moment, Mr. Seamore’s smile faltered. I was not sure if it was actually what happened on his face, but it was what I saw.
	“Oh well, I appreciate the hard work lad…But ya’ know I do value some privacy so…Don’t you worry about my own room. I can still manage that at least.” He chuckled and his familiar smile returned. 
	Shifting his glasses with a wrinkle of his nose, he got up from our small dining table and announced his departure to his quarters. We exchanged good nights, but I couldn’t help it. I just couldn’t help but ask. 
	“Do you have any family, Mr. Seamore.”
	He paused on his way up the steps. His spectacle inflated eye peaked over his hunched shoulder as his head gently shook. 
	“Oh no no, never met the right someone I suppose. Never did good with love anyways. Your company’s just enough.”
	He turned and walked into the darkness.

	The next morning, I found the house untouched from the night before and despite not hearing the huff of snoring emerging from his doorway, I concluded Mr. Seamore was just sleeping in. A common occurrence in the flexible and practically empty schedule of an elderly man like him.
	 While making myself breakfast, the house creaked with each of my steps, echoing slightly to break the quiet morning air. 
	My work of the day began with spreading fertilizer across the crops. In the now intimately familiar field, I toiled away. The waist high growth brushed against each other in the wind, creating a musical shimmer. In this meditative state paranoia began to bubble up in my spine. My skin tingled under the sensation of being watched. Whipping up I quickly surveyed the land around me, stopping as I became aware of a dark silhouette standing a few hundred feet away, next to the tree line. 
	It was Mr. Seamore. Looking at me.
	In the split second our gazes met I could note no discernible emotion in the grooves and wrinkles of his usually friendly face. His head was still, absent of its usual shiver. However, on the other end of a momentary blink, darkness gave way to his signature smile and nod. He waved and motioned for me to continue whatever it was I was doing. I did not turn away but he did, walking back towards the house.
	I did not get much work done that day. Mr. Seamore was not a threatening man, but in my usual isolated routine, the idea of anyone spectating, unknown to me but for the bumps on my neck, was heavily distracting. 

	When I retired to join the old man in the house, I decided to ask about it.
	“Hey, uh- Albert. Why were you watching me uh- work this morning?”
	“Oh! Sorry son; didn’t mean to startle ya’. Just stayed home today and wanted to check on your work, lad. And I’m glad to know you’re doing great. You’re a hard working boy, Nathan.” He smiled.
	“Oh well, I appreciate that sir. You were sleeping in this morning and I didn’t want to wake you, so I just started tidying the back shed.”
	“Ah- yes- yes. Thanks for that. I find I need more and more sleep each day. Guess it’s all part of getting old.” He said, exhaling and shaking his head.
	I found his answer adequate and my worries were slightly alleviated.
	“Say, do you smoke sir? I was thinking I’d have a smoke out on the porch and watch the sunset, if you care to join me.”
	“No, no. Ya’ don’t get to my old age by smoking, son. But I’d love to join you; that sounds lovely.”
	I went upstairs to my room and retrieved a pack of cigarettes from the small leather bag I kept in the wall compartment. I met Mr. Seamore on the porch which he was already sat. Rocking in his chair, a second empty for me a few feet adjacent.
	The two of us conversed here and there about life and whatnot, but mostly we sat in silence, watching the great ball of flame melt upon the horizon of pine. I believe it’s when you can sit in the absence of conversation and remain comfortable, that you truly know someone. I was contemplating that when the old man said:
	“Are you happy here, my boy? It’s been nearly two weeks now and you’ve been an incredible help. I sincerely hope you don’t die of boredom up here.”
	“No, no sir. I actually enjoy the serenity.”
	“Well that’s good. Young folk are always chasing something so big. But I learned in my own youth that you rarely make it that far. But ya’ got to be okay with that, ya’ know?”
	“Well, I never had any great ambitions to begin with sir. I guess I’m similar to you, I’m okay with something quaint. All I ever wanted was to leave the city. The constant whirring really got to be.”
	“Ah, I get that my boy.”
	In a lapse of conversation I decided to ask:
	“But.. do you ever think about what life would’ve been, if you went for something greater?”
	He thought for a moment. “No, I guess I lost that curiosity long ago. The majority of my life has been small. But I’m happy. I’m happy here.”
	“It is very nice here, Albert. I think I get it.”
	When the sun disappeared, we retreated to our beds. That night’s sleep came reluctantly as the house creaked more than usual.

	The morning of my twelfth day began the same as the last 11. I ate breakfast with Mr. Seamore and bid him farewell as he left in his rusty truck on another voyage to god knows where. After mowing the expansive lawn I began cleaning inside the many purposeless rooms of the house that sat collecting dust.
	A muted and singular thud rang out from the second floor above me.
	I froze. I was alone. Above me, I was fairly sure, was Mr. Seamore’s room.
	I cautiously made my way upstairs and noticed the old man’s door slightly ajar. Of course I had questions about what lay in there after my previous discovery, and of course the noise and unshut door irrefutably invited me in. 
	Inside, the room was nearly as I left it two days ago, just slightly used, bedsheets unmade, minimal dust buildup, etc. The air of the place seemed to carry whispered secrets as it sucked up all the gentle noises the structure regularly extruded. I looked around for a few minutes when I noticed the subtle scratch marks on the floor had grown in intensity. They seemed to lead in a curved path from the wood panelled wall. Gazing over the surface I observed a spot where the end of five panels, from the ground to about four feet up, lined up in a straight break. After a bit of prying and elbow grease my self doubt and thoughts of irrational paranoia were alleviated as the panels gave way to a hinged trapdoor. I only stole a quick glance inside the small room before I heard the front door clatter and squeak open. I hastily shut the compartment and left Mr. Seamore’s door ajar as it was before. Looking down the stairway I saw him dropping his keys and taking a seat on the couch.
	“Oh hey there son. How’s it going?” He said pleasantly after seeing me.
	“I’m- I’m doing just fine…uh- just tidying my own room. Ya’ know I- I kinda neglected it with my other jobs and such.”
	“Ah, makes sense. Some folks need a tidy place to sleep like that.” He scratched the back of his neck. 
	“Yeah, yeah…what are you doing home so early?” It was only 11.
	“I hope you weren’t somewhere you’re not supposed to be.”
	“Huh?” My face dropped and a bead of sweat left my brow to tap the step beneath me.
	“Huh? Oh sorry. Yeah I just went out to watch a film in the city. Didn’t much feel like sticking around once it ended. Thought I might as well come home.”
	“Oh okay, yeah…”
	I avoided the old man for the rest of the day.
	I could only see it for a second. Hundreds of unlit candles lay melted into one amalgamation on the chamber’s floor. Drapes of rag hung from the ceiling in flowing patterns, as if the room itself wore a veil. Upon the limited surface area of the walls hung many paintings of swirling black that created impressions of forms I did not know. On every inch of wood between such frames were the scribbles and ramblings of incomprehensible… ideas? Prayers? I have no clue. 
	I found that after that day I did not want to stay with Mr. Albert Seamore any longer.

	After two weeks I had had my fill of this property and was paid an adequate enough amount so that I was more than okay with leaving. I did not know what the old man had going on, what secrets he held about his past and present, but I was not about to be involved. So, on the fourteenth day, I approached Mr. Seamore to announce my resignation. He was home by five and I had finished my final work.
	“Uh… sir. May I have a word.”
	“Oh, of course son. What do you need?”
	“I think I’m- I think I’m going to go home now. I think I’ve uh- worked here long enough, I think.”
	His smile dropped slightly and a look of concern infected his features. “Oh well that’s a shame. I do so enjoy the company and you’re a mighty help. I really don’t know how I’ll keep this place going without you. Do ya’ need more money? Ya’ need only ask my boy.”
	“No, no that’s okay…I just think I may be more well off in the city now… try and make something of myself now… if that’s alright.”
	He grew more stern. “But I thought you liked it here. Do you not like it here?”
	“Oh no Mr. Seamore I do enjoy this place I- I just feel as though I’m falling behind. Like I better catch up with the worl-”
	“Call me Albert.”
	I paused. “Oh… okay”
	“I think ya’ best stay another day or two to see how ya’ feel boy.”
	“I really think-“
	“No, I think ya’ best stay.”
	His face had completely dropped now. I had never seen the man so cold. 
	I retreated. Without a phone or my own car, what was I going to do? I just crept backwards towards the stairs, maintaining eye contact with my captor. On the first step I turned and hastily went to my room. 
	I was practically silent for dinner. As we ate the clank of dishware and gated chewing was interrupted by the old man’s attempts at conversation.
	“Ya’ know boy, I saw a young lad who looked just like you in town today. Good lookin’ fella working down at the bowling alley. Uh, what was his name…Ricky? Roger? Ah! It was Roger, definitely Roger.”
	“Oh uh… yeah.”
	I came to the conclusion that night that I would simply steal the man’s truck in the shadow of darkness. He always left his keys hanging at the front door. All I would have to do is take a drive to the nearest town, get his truck towed back to his driveway in the night, back in time for his morning expedition. I would just take a taxi the rest of the way, and live the rest of my life in some distant place, likely safe from the possibility of ever reuniting with Mr. Albert Seamore.

	After laying awake for what I assumed could only have been a dozen hours, the sun long set outside my window, I got up. Gently tip-toeing across the delicate hardwood I tried my best not to make the house scream. I held my breath as I traversed the short, tangled path to the stairs. On the eighth step they cracked, on the twelfth I was free. Approaching the front door I found the old man’s keys, hung on a small, ornate wall fixture, decorated with a small quilted keychain. I grabbed them.
	My final obstacle was the door. It seemed to tower above me. Scraped and eroded with age, the wood was filled with deep scratches. I knew if I opened it, it would shriek. It would crack a wide chasm in the silence of night as it violently squealed open. As if a siren, my presence would be known. But I didn’t care. I gently, but quickly swung the door open. It cracked only once. I did the same with the screen door. It cracked only twice. To me, my escape was guaranteed, so I just prayed the sounds would blend in with the normal, nightly voices of the structure. 
	Speeding across the gravel driveway, my bare feet were agonized by the jagged rock. It was just me out there. I know it was. That night was so quiet. It was just my frantic footsteps and my heaving breath in that darkness. It was just me flinging open the car door and leaping into the driver’s seat, seconds away from launching the key into the ignition to let loose the roar of an engine into the silence. 	But it was not just me.
	 It was not just me, when I looked to my left and met with the spectacle magnified, bug-like pupils of Albert Seamore. An inch away from the glass, his breath laid a patch of fog on the glass. 
	“What are you doing, Nathan?”
	“I-“
	“Go back to bed, son. Go back to bed, son.” He showed no discernible expression as he slowly opened the car door. I was frozen.
	“Go back to bed, son.”
	I stepped out slowly, awkwardly maneuvering around the man as he stood still, only turning his head to maintain his gaze.
	“You should go back to bed, son.”
	He slowly pointed to the front door, still ajar. I was compelled, yet reluctant, to turn my back to the man and do as he said. And I did. I felt his searing eyes burn holes in the back of my head as I walked all the way back to my room. I never heard him move away from his stance at the car, though I felt the eyes the entire way. Of course I never slept.
	Hours of paralyzing fear passed like a thousand. Once my terror had ever so slightly dissipated, deciding that if I was in physical danger I would likely have suffered such by now, vulnerable and helpless as I was in that room, I got up. I got up and stood there for a long time. In the dread my legs’ ache became obsolete. After this small lapse I continued gently towards the window. I felt I needed to look out. I needed to see outside. 
	And solitary in the field there stood a man. Torch flame alight in his hand, he was still. Facing away from me, the flickering light illuminated the surrounding crop, painting a vivid red line around his hunched form. He did nothing at all. 
	For thirty minutes, I watched him stand like that. I was not sure if I had happened to look out the window around the same time his presence befell the field, or if he had stood there for hours before. But, soon his neck craned. His head turned to me. Right into my window, his gaze fell. I ducked quickly, but there was no way he would have even seen me from so far away, in a dark window to a dark room, what difference would a silhouette make on the black, right?
	I sat under that window until dawn arrived.

	In the morning, so exhausted my eyes ached as if melting out the bags beneath them, I slumped downstairs cautiously. A singular piece of paper, ripped from something larger, sat on the countertop. It read:
I will be leaving for a few days. It will be okay. We will be okay.
	He wasn’t lying, his truck was gone, the house was quiet, and I was completely alone. I knew what I had to do.
	Unworried about monitoring my volume I clattered upstairs to the place in the wall. Prying open the panelling, the trapdoor swung open. Before me was a small room as I had seen before, the area of which could not have been larger than 16 square feet and five feet tall. I imagine one could only sit down in there, on the small area of bare floor in the center. The monster of candles stretching over the room was alight on hundreds of its wicks. Along with the indecipherable scribblings and paintings I had seen before, the center of the opposite wall presented a portrait of something I couldn’t understand. Even through the paint strokes of adaptation, I was beneath its power. I had no idea what was being depicted, but I made out an eye in the chaos. A small dot I could only assume looked down on me. What was I witnessing in this snapshot of artistic expression? What could it possibly be?
	Below the work, an ancient note read:
I love you, oh Great One
	Beneath was a small red cloth draped over a small table, on top was something that made me fall back in shock. An offering, I assumed, sat there. A small skull, old and grey, shattered and collapsed at the right temple, a second set of teeth above the first, on both the bottom and top jaws. I slammed the trapdoor shut. Inside I locked every possible point of entrance, even barricading the front and my bedroom doors. Stacked high were the old man’s antique furniture against everything. 
	I don’t know what I planned to do, perhaps I thought an angel would descend and take me away from Albert Seamore’s hell. I just didn’t want him to come back, I never wanted to see him again. I guess I planned to kill him upon his arrival proceeding his current escapade, so I set up any jangly devices, bells and windchimes, etc, that I could find. Set along each doorway I knew when the old man came along I would be prepared. I went to bed with an axe meant for wood chopping next to me.

	Laying sleepless in the night, fist tight around the wooden grip, I heard murmurings. Creaks and echoes of the house shattered my ears as they came. I flinched and writhed of fear each time the wind tunnelled through a hallway and rumbled the delicate frames of my prison. I could’ve sworn I heard impossible whispers in other rooms. Multiple voices below, adjacent, above, outside. Conversations of the night tormented me with their vague existence. I convinced myself none of it meant anything.
	But then a whisper came from my own room.
	So close to my ear that I felt the air of breath.
	“I love you…” 
	A visceral, primal shock of horror ripped through my nervous system and out of pure reactionary intent, I swung. The axe flew like a hurricane as I whipped my shoulder towards the side of the voice’s origin. A boom echoed out in a split second cacophony of sound as the blade crashed into the wooden frame of my bed, leaving my grip. In the chaos something scittered away, crashing through my bedroom door’s reinforcements. The bells echoed out. The moment was deafening. I saw nothing in the shroud of night, but I heard it all, I heard it leave.
	I jumped up, adrenaline expelling all exhaustion out of me, and ran downstairs. The front door’s barricade was thrown apart and the door wide open. It was just me now. In the silence I was sure. Though, I had been sure before, and when I ascended those steps and entered my room to retrieve the axe, I noticed the storage space in the wall was slightly ajar. A small note on the floor nearby.
Bear witness to my love  
	Looking inside, I of course saw what I feared. Reeking of piss and shit, the space contained empty cans and a scrunched up blanket.
	I ran. I ran with everything I had. I began down the road. In delirium I ended up careening through the woods. Tumbling over rock and brush I felt the blood in my head thin. The taste of iron overwhelmed me as I heaved. Where was I running to? Would I ever stop? Or would I just die here instead? After endless woods, it just kept going and going and going. So I collapsed. I spent my last few seconds of consciousness sitting against a mighty tree. Weak and helpless. As my eyes shut, the leaves to my right crunched. A gentle, wet kiss grazed my forehead.

	The brush of wheat on my skin woke me up. I was lying down in a field I knew very well. I did not need to get up to guess. I stretched my fingers to make sure I was alive and as my joints slowly bent, I heard quiet crackling. I looked down upon myself to see what had become of me. I was completely naked and covered entirely with dried blood. Injuryless, I assumed it was not my own. Brush stroke patterns could be seen in my coating, and the layer was equal across every inch of my skin, suggesting it had been applied carefully by someone. But of course I knew who did it.
	In my sleep induced, dream-like hysteria, I stood up slowly, feeling as though I was gently floating to my feet. 
	And I saw it.
	In the night a great flame bellowed from the center of the field. An intentional circle had been lit in the crop, a small opening in the fire facing me, inviting me in. 
	But in the center, in the center he stood.
	Like a beacon flaring up from the earth to reach something greater in the sky, he stood. On an enormous cross, towering ten feet above me, he had been crucified. Cut apart into hundreds of mangled, bloodied pieces and reassembled into a horrific imitation of the human form. Blood flowed out as each piece pressed against another to flow like a river down the cross. But it wasn’t just him on this obelisk of human meat offering. No, the form was much too large. I could tell there were others mixed into the construction. But the worst part…his eyes. The only eyes in that nailed together, mess of a face. Impossibly wide they glared down at me, pupils small and judgmental. To this day, I am unsure if I imagined them following me, or if they actually did. In that moment of terror it felt as though I was at the center of everything. The air was thick and the sky rumbled. Did the clouds shift into form or did I imagine it? In every possible sense, I felt I was being watched.
	So I ran.
	Through my unbearable sickness, vomiting on myself as I went, I turned and ran to the woods. I looked at the house for the final time. It was engulfed in flames. 
	I don’t know how long I ran. I don’t really know where I ended up. But, eventually, the pines gave way.

	I never thought I would have made it out of the hopeless city, I never thought I could escape that labyrinthine farm property in those woods, I never thought I could ever live without seeing the mangled face of Albert Seamore in a dark corner, in the black behind my eyelids, in the abyss of a loved one’s pupil. But eventually, the pines will give way.

1l3dwdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1l3dwdu/trip_report_for_richmond_and_london_late_april/,Trip report for Richmond and London: late April into early May 2025,"We are a married couple from the United States (Gen X age group). This was our 5th trip to England in 4 years

Day 1 Saturday:

We started the trip at Richmond and stayed 6 nights at the Orange Tree pub hotel at an average of £164 per night for a King room. It was a good location and good value and included continental breakfast, but the planes flying overhead were very low and very loud. We stayed on the top floor and thankfully the room had AC as the weather was quite warm during our visit with zero rain.

On arrival day we had lunch at Pizza Portofino, wandered the Richmond Green (saw a cricket match) and walked around Richmond Palace, then got gelato at Gelateria Danieli. I was delighted by all the wisteria in bloom - so pretty! But I was extremely groggy from the overnight flight and felt myself hitting an emotional and cognitive wall, so I went back to the room and did the unthinkable: I took a nap. The nap helped immensely and I didn’t have any trouble getting up after snoozing for 1 hour. Then we went to the Ted Lasso gift shop and walked along the Riverside. Had dinner at our pub hotel (Orange Tree). The food was fine but took a long time to come out, so we didn’t eat there again during the trip. 

Day 2 Sunday: 

Had breakfast at the hotel then walked to the Richmond Hill view point. There is something really magical about this hill that I can’t put into words, and pictures don’t really do it justice. You have to experience it for yourself! We continued the walk up to King Henry’s Mound (I enjoyed using the Merlin app to identify all the bird sounds in the area), then back down the Capital Ring path past The Dysart Petersham to the Terrace Gardens. 

We had Sunday roast at the Prince’s Head (prebooked). The service was great and the pub is all decked out in Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond gear, but the food was a bit flavorless compared to other roasts I’ve had in England. Did some window shopping then rested in the room. That night we ate dinner at Sebastian’s Italian restaurant, which was excellent.

Day 3 Monday:

Spent 6 hours at Kew Gardens! We entered via Victoria Gate and exited out of Lion Gate. Had a light lunch at The Orangery (for convenience sake). Went in most (if not all) of the glasshouses and toured Kew Palace & The Royal Kitchens. The palace was rather somber, understandably so if you are familiar with the story of King George III and his illness. Queen Charlotte’s Cottage wasn’t open but we saw the exterior, along with the Great Pagoda. We really enjoyed the Woodland walk as it was shady and cool, with lots of bluebells in bloom! Dinner that night was sushi at Hanana - very good.

Day 4 Tuesday:

Had a full English breakfast at Butter Beans cafe - very tasty and satisfying! Then I went to Kew Archives to do some family history research (I looked at chancery records that mention some of my ancestors). Meanwhile, my husband took the Tube to South Kensington and did a tour of Royal Albert Hall and also popped into the V&A. We reunited around 5 pm to see the MI-5 exhibit at Kew. We found it a bit underwhelming. Dinner was at Curry Bae Indian restaurant (slow service but tasty food).

Day 5 Wednesday:

This was a fully packed and fun day out in Twickenham. Originally I had planned to go to Ham House, but I checked the website a few days before and saw that it was closed for filming (Bridgerton S4 perhaps?) so I had to revise the plan, but everything worked out. We had coffee at Black Sheep then walked across the bridge to Marble Hill house. Interesting house with lots of volunteers on hand to tell the stories of the property and its owner Henrietta Howard. Then we popped into the Orleans House Gallery (free to enter, loved the Octagon Room) and squeezed in a visit to the Turner House (home of artist JMW Turner). Lunch was at The Crown in Twickenham - a lovely pub. Our last house of the day was Strawberry Hill, a “gothic revival villa” - highly recommend! It was blissfully uncrowded. We didn’t need any bookings for this day, which was wonderful.

All of our transport up to this point was on foot, but we took the bus back to Richmond and had a pint at The Cricketer’s. Dinner was Italian at Bacco (it was fine, but we liked Sebastian’s better).

Day 6 Thursday:

We went to Windsor for the day via train from Richmond. (I had already been years ago but my husband hadn’t.) We walked around the riverside (saw the swans) then watched the Windsor Guard March. Our prebooked entry for the castle was 11:30 but maybe I should have booked later in the day. Holy moly it was crowded. Lots of European tourists and school groups. Honestly I think they let too many people into the castle at one time. We had to queue for each portion: The State Rooms, Queen Mary’s Dollhouse, and inside St George’s Chapel. No photos allowed inside. It felt like a cattle herd and not super enjoyable. We skipped the Long Walk - it was too hot (at least 80F/27C). We had afternoon tea (this was also our lunch) at The Ivy. The sandwiches and sweets were not my favorite, but the service and presentation were excellent. 

Back in Richmond: we had dinner and pints at Railway Tavern. I think I had a chicken and mushroom pie.

I really wanted to make another visit to Richmond Hill but we didn’t have time or energy :-(

Day 7 Friday:

Moved to the next hotel: The Clermont Charing Cross Hotel, King Deluxe room for 3 nights, breakfast not included, average nightly rate of £394 per night (ouch). Prices were really high for this weekend. I didn’t like this hotel as much as I thought I would. Front desk personnel were very friendly and professional, but we were in the portion of the hotel that is over the bridge/walkway and the route to our room was confusing. The hallway outside our room smelled like a mix of truffle oil and dirty socks. The room itself was fine.

While waiting for our room to be ready, we walked across the Golden Jubilee bridge to Southbank and went to see the newish Paddington Mural. We stayed in this area when we visited in 2022 and we noticed this time it was much more crowded, not really with locals but with tourists from Europe. The crowds continued all weekend, presumably due to the May 1 bank holiday in Europe. (I think in the future I will avoid central London on this weekend).

Lunch was Hobson’s Fish & Chips. It was very busy - good thing we got there right at noon when they opened. Then we went to Covent Garden and popped into the Coach & Horses because they were advertising a Pimm’s Cup on their board and we love a good Pimm’s Cup. Good vibes at this pub - highly recommend. 

Dinner was the pre-theatre meal at Bocca di Lupo - a great choice! We sat at the chef’s counter and service was exceptional. Then we saw Oliver at The Gielgud, first row balcony. Tickets were pricey but totally worth it. I loved the music, choreography, and energy in this show. The whole cast was phenomenal, especially Simon Lipkin as Fagin. 

Day 8 Saturday:

We had coffee at Blank Street and decided we prefer Black Sheep lol. Then we took the Tube to Oxford Circus because my husband wanted to visit the Gibson Garage. Walked from there to Outernet at Tottenham Court Road. I was really disappointed to see the changes at Outernet since my last visit. The small hall to the left now has a completely unnecessary coffee bar in the middle of it and the large hall to the right is either taken over by boring adverts or closed for private events. At least the semi-hidden walkway to the south is still open. 

We had lunch at Flat Iron, Tottenham Court Road (prebooked). We love this chain. I always get the steak with creamed spinach, and my husband gets the burger with chips. When we first visited in 2022 the steak was only £12, now it’s up to £15 but still a great value, and they give you a free ice cream cone at the end.

Next we walked to St James Piccadilly. There was a free lunchtime piano concert in the church (they might do this every Saturday?). Then we walked through the Burlington & Piccadilly shopping arcades and went to Fortnum & Mason. It was so crowded in there I couldn’t think straight. I bought some loose-leaf tea and we left. We completely forgot to visit the food hall on the lower level! (next time…)

Dinner was the pre-theatre meal at Cora Pearl and it was meh. Our starters and drinks came out fast but the mains took a long time. I had every intention of ordering dessert, but we didn’t have enough time.

Our show that night was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button at the Ambassadors Theatre. Great performances in a smaller, more intimate theatre. I think I prefer a different style of show, with more memorable music, but it was good.

On the way back to the hotel we stopped at The Marquis pub, which was packed (it’s smaller than it appears on social media). A DJ was playing “Mod Classics.” The vibe in here was amazing!! Lots of regulars, mostly a middle-aged crowd, everyone very friendly. 

Day 9 Sunday

Went to the National Gallery right when they opened at 10 AM (prebooked time slot). There were 2 long queues - one for those who prebooked and one for those who didn’t. Confusing at first, but the prebooked line did move faster. We just saw the permanent collection (free). Didn’t take long.

We then went back to the hotel to grab our dirty clothes and headed to Boswell Laundry. (I've had bad experiences sending my laundry out at a hotel so I prefer to go to a launderette). The attendant made change for us and provided washing powder/detergent pod. We washed and dried our load in about 70 mins for \~£11. This was really the only time we needed cash.

I then tried and failed to get a last-minute Sunday roast booking at various nearby pubs. The only times available were too late in the afternoon. We ended up eating lunch at the Franco Manca in Holborn. We decided we prefer Pizza Express. 

We had coffee and a pastry at Ole & Steen on the walk back to the hotel. Yes, it’s a chain, but we like it. We took a walk down Embankment, over Westminster Bridge, then had half pints at Between the Bridges. Then went back The Marquis for a pint and some excellent people watching. 

For dinner we tried to go to Mother Mash and were turned away, fulled booked. We ended up at Nag’s Head pub in the upstairs dining room. I didn’t have high expectations but I was blown away by how good the steak & ale pie was here. Highly recommend. I was also able to add a side of carrots and parsnips, which made up for the fact that I missed Sunday roast. On the walk back to the hotel we caught the end of a guitar busker sing-along in Covent Garden. Good times.

Day 10 Monday (Bank holiday)

On Monday my husband flew home and I switched hotels to stay 5 more nights solo. This report is getting long so I might post my solo portion in another post... But hopefully I have inspired you to visit Richmond and Twickenham.

1l3dshv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l3dshv/the_devils_on_the_delta/,The Devils on The Delta,"
The camp that day was too busy—too alive for the heat. Shouted orders echoed across the clearing, punctuated by the wet thumps of boots sinking into orange mud. The air hung thick and unmoving—like a well-fed snake, it slithered slow, unhurried. No breeze stirred the dark green leaves or the broad, swaying palms high above in the treeline. Even under stretched canvas, there was no relief.

Every surface gleamed with a slick sheen of damp. You could fight heat with water, sure—hydration was key. Water cooled the body, flushed the system. But this… this wasn’t heat alone. This was a stew of humidity, the kind found in a kitchen that never stops boiling lobsters, crabs, and corn. Imagine that—and you’re halfway there.

Foot care had been drilled into them back at boot camp, over and over. But no one mentioned how fatigues would rub and chafe in all the wrong places—how armpits would blaze raw, rashes bloom around your waist like angry halos. No one said you could get jungle rot on your balls—raw, weeping sores that stank like a week-dead fish abandoned on the riverbank.

But hey—as long as your feet were dry, as long as you had clean socks and could still walk straight on patrol, everything was peachy, right?

If it had been quiet, maybe you could’ve coped. Just lie still, soak up some rays. But no—the noise made it worse. Ammo boxes dropped like bricks. Grunts shouting over trenches, laughing, cussing, singing off-key to a radio that crackled more hiss than harmony.

Hueys whupped low over the sediment-heavy river, their rotors barely shifting the dense air. That same air was thick with layers of scent: the sweet-pungent tang of gasoline, smoke from woodfires, the acrid burn of overheated engines—and through it all, the underlying stink of the river: sewer-sweet, rotten.

On the makeshift wharf, thrown together by the engineer corps, sat Jackson.

The boys called him Birdie—on account of his whistling. At reveille, in the latrine, cleaning his rifle—it didn’t matter. He whistled like a songbird that hadn’t yet realized it was caged.

Now he sat as if behind a piano in some smoky, back-alley jazz club. Perched on a box of .50 cal rounds, back straight, head nodding to a rhythm only he could hear. Arms bent. Fingers moving swift and sure across an imaginary keyboard—just him and the crate, keeping time.

The radio crackled, hissed—and then, miraculously, cleared. A change in tune.
“Mack the Knife.”
Ella Fitzgerald’s voice slid through the static—smooth, warm, honeyed.

Jackson’s fingers stilled.
He drifted away…

---

Three days before his eighteenth birthday, Jackson stood at the crossroads.

It was the last day of May, heat rising from the land in slow, lazy waves—not yet unbearable in his home state of Louisiana. He stood at the heart of a four-way crossroads, seven or eight miles from his family’s farm. Close to midnight, he reckoned. A waning moon cast soft blue-white light over the scene, bathing the world in an eerie, ethereal glow.

Cotton fields stretched out on all sides, the earthy, musty scent of the crop thick in the night air. He wasn’t quite a man—not yet—but he aimed to become one real soon. The gravel crunched beneath his thick leather boots as he paced in a tight circle, nerves ticking through his limbs. One hand ran over his sweat-dampened scalp, across his tight, coarse black curls.

He’d heard his uncle talk about Robert Johnson when he was just a boy. The tale hadn’t scared him like it was meant to—it had stuck. Haunted him. Played over in his mind through long, hungry years. Because how else was he supposed to lift his daddy and momma out of the dirt?

His father, old before his time, hunched and weathered, hands thick with calluses from a life behind the plough and with little to show for it. His mother—oh, his poor momma—cooking and cleaning at the big house for folks still pretending the world hadn’t turned.

He stopped pacing. Looked down at his hands—slim, agile fingers.
""You got talent, boy!"" they’d said. Plenty of times. But talent wasn’t enough. Talent opened the door; luck decided if you got invited in.

With a heavy sigh, Jackson rubbed his sweaty palms down the legs of his rough wool trousers.
""I’m too old for fairy tales,"" he muttered.

He cast one last look down the three roads in front of him, about to turn back—when he heard it.

Footsteps on gravel behind him. Then a melodic whistle, lilting and slow.
It stopped him cold.

Spinning on his heel, a little puff of dust rising, Jackson’s wide eyes locked onto a stranger.

The man strolled toward him with lazy confidence, a black cane balanced across his shoulder. Though the night air was warm, a chill wrapped itself around Jackson's spine. His breath caught in his chest—his heart thumped like a brass drum being struck from the inside.

The stranger came to a halt a few feet away. He wore a tall hat—Jackson remembered hearing it called a stovepipe once—and stood a little taller, a little broader than Jackson himself. A long, knee-length coat hung off his shoulders, its dark cloth near-black beneath the moonlight. Beneath it, a cotton shirt lay open at the collar, a loose cravat drooping beneath his neck.

Lowering the cane, the man lifted his hat’s brim and offered a low, sweeping bow. His face, now free of shadow, tilted up—meeting Jackson’s gaze.

His eyes gleamed dark and deep, like coals dancing behind glass. Sharp cheekbones framed his face, a short curly beard lining a strong jaw. His smile was wide and easy, too perfect to be safe.
“Late for one so young, mon cher, to be out in these fields, yes?”

His voice rolled like thick molasses, sweet and smooth. Jackson said nothing.

“Ah… such shyness,” the man crooned, tilting his head, grin never faltering. “Come now, petit, tell us why you’re here, eh?”

The cane flicked up, then gently tapped Jackson’s shoulder. Not hard—but enough to stir him from the spell.

Jackson blinked, swallowed, managed to close his slack mouth. “I—I don’t…”

The stranger laughed—a rich, velvet sound—and began to circle Jackson with an odd, stalking gait, the way a predator tests a meal it doesn’t yet intend to eat.

“Not yet a man, no,” he said, voice almost purring. “But close, oui? I see why you came. You seek old Clooty, yes? Come, boy. Tell us what you want. Say it clear.”

Jackson saw it then—not with his eyes, but with the longing in his soul.

He saw crowded clubs, packed tight with people cheering, clapping, screaming to hear him play. He saw record deals, stacks of money, a suit that fit him like it was made from starlight. He saw his father in fine clothes, standing tall. His mother smiling like she hadn’t smiled in years.

A warm, dry whisper tickled his ear.
“Sign here, mon cher. I have the pen.

---

A sharp whistle snapped Jackson back to the present.

He was still perched on that munitions box, his fatigues soaked through—especially under the arms and across his back—dark with sweat and clinging like second skin.

“Yo! Birdie! C’mon, man—let’s hustle! We got eighty clicks of sewage and green hell ahead of us. Grab that brick your ass is on and get aboard!”

Jackson blinked. Rubbed the heat from his eyes. He snatched up the M16 propped beside him, then hefted the heavy .50 cal ammo box onto his shoulder. A quick nod—a soldier’s farewell—and he climbed aboard the olive-drab and jungle-camouflaged gunboat.

Let’s get some, he thought.

---

Night fell fast in the jungle. No lingering, romantic sunsets here—just light one minute, then darkness like a dropped curtain.

After an uneventful patrol upstream, Captain Chayson—Chay to the men—ordered the riverboat close to shore. A short while later, they slipped into an RPB, a makeshift rest post thrown together by the engineers just days ago. Sandbags, broken crates, and sheets of corrugated metal made up a crude dock. They tied up against another boat headed downriver, and Jackson was handed watch duty—alone with both crafts.

The rest of the crew had vanished just before dusk, laughing and ribbing him on their way out.
Old man Chayson had chewed him out earlier over something Jackson still swore wasn’t his fault.
“That was my lucky coffee mug, Bird. And you decided to throw it overboard?”
Those piercing steel-blue eyes of Chay’s had sparkled with mischief, sure—but the spit flying from his mouth and flecking his beard? That hadn’t matched the tone.
Jackson had protested. Last he saw, the mug had been on the map table, leaving brown rings on the charts.

At least Adams—solid, steady Adams with two tours already behind him—had slipped him a couple Lucky Strikes and a Hershey bar before leaving.

Jackson tipped his helmet back slightly and spat into the swirling black of the Mekong.

He lit a cigarette, letting the smoke fill his lungs. The orange-red tip flared, briefly casting a glow against his cheek. He held it in, then exhaled slowly into the thick, still air.

Sitting by Chayson’s wheel, he flicked the butt into the undergrowth. It sparked once against a wet stump—then the jungle swallowed it whole. All was quiet now. A few sounds had floated down earlier—some guys arguing over cards, no doubt—but the silence had settled back like a shroud.

Only the occasional creak from the tied ropes or the groan of the metal hull kept him company as the current rolled past.

Jackson leaned his head against the cool metal rail, eyes scanning the black water. The stillness crept into his bones.

“Shit!” he cursed, a little too loud.

Something with too many teeth had landed on his neck and bit deep. He slapped at it hard—but froze as he heard it—

A sound.

Not the jungle. Not water.

A laugh.

Wet. Slippery. Wrong.

It came from behind him.


---

Jackson snapped alert, M16 gripped tight, swinging toward the sound.

Crouched on a crate, lashed down in the corner of the boat, was a man-shaped silhouette. But darker. Too dark. It swallowed light.

What chilled Jackson’s blood wasn’t the figure—it was the smile. Shark-like. Wide. Gleaming teeth lit from within, as if they remembered hellfire.

“Ah, my little zanmi,” it purred, the voice slipping out, languid and thick. “Why youse make old Clooty come to this dirty, hot country, huh?”

Jackson’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. He clutched his rifle tighter—not like a weapon, but like a crucifix.

The smile vanished. The silhouette shifted.

A match flared. A furnace of light in a closed fist. Sulphur bit the air.

“You—you’re—what the hell are you doing here?” Jackson managed to rasp.

Old Clooty, a slim lit cheroot pinched between thin lips, took a long drag and exhaled. The smoke curled unnaturally—floating, coiling, like it knew something.

He lowered the cheroot to his knee, still crouched. The glow revealed eyes—glistening. Hungry.

Jackson stared.

The helmet was standard issue—cloth-covered M1—tilted rakishly. Tucked into the band were two black aces and two black eights. Spades and clubs. The dead man’s hand.

His fatigues were crisp. Clean. No sweat stains. The company patch on each shoulder grinned—a demon’s head, baring sharp teeth. Beneath it, upside-down sergeant stripes. Where U.S. Army should be: “Devils Own.”

“You have something of mine, mon chéri,” Clooty said, voice dry as old paper.

His smile returned. He tilted his head. “We have a contract still, yes?”

Jackson stood straighter, sweat slick on his brow. The rifle eased slightly from his chest, though still held firm. His voice came stronger than he felt.

“You promised me fame. Fortune. Ain’t got neither. You can go pound sand. I got nothing for you. Hear me? Nothing.”

Clooty tipped his head back and laughed.

It was like someone tuning a violin with broken strings.

He brought his blazing gaze down and said, calm as sin, “Boy... you came knockin’ on my door. You don’t like my encore, moun fou? Difisil. Tough luck.”

He took another drag, blew a smoke ring that twisted into a noose.

“You take my offer. Come back with me. Neon lounge, baby grand, ivory keys still wet from the last girl who played ’em. Coin. Sweet-tasting bel fanm just for you. Refuse—”

He spat on the deck.

Jackson glared, lip curled, heart pounding.

Then—snap.

A branch behind him.

“Psst… Hey, Jackson. Chay says I’m to relieve you. Go find a hole, man. Who the hell you talkin’ to anyway?”

It was Adams, stepping from the undergrowth.

Jackson turned back.

The crate was empty.

But the cigar smoke still curled in the air. And it smelled like brimstone.

---

They passed a village the next day. Women washing clothes got doused with spray as the gunboat surged by. Some were knocked into the river. The crew—Chayson included—roared with laughter.

“C’mon, guys. Not funny,” Adams muttered, but his voice held no force.

Jackson said nothing, but his eyes lingered on the struggling women. He shook his head.

They were getting close to Firebase Endzone.

Or as the men called it: Devil’s Armpit.

The river narrowed, green choking in tighter, like a throat. Jackson leaned back near the wheelhouse. His skin prickled.

No birds. No monkeys. Nothing.

“Stand ready,” Chayson barked.

The banks rose. The boat felt smaller. Smothered.

Ahead, shadows moved. Black shapes in the foliage. Ducking down.

Crack!

Orange blooms lit the trees. Splinters of paint flew from the hull. Screams.

One sharp. One low and awful.

“Adams!” Jackson shouted, even as his finger squeezed the trigger.

Gunpowder stung his eyes. He smelled hot brass, oil, sweat.

The boat surged forward as Chayson gunned the engine, bow lifting. But it felt slow—like wading through glue.

Jackson’s rifle thumped against his shoulder. The jungle shredded with every shot.

Then—

Clunk.

His weapon jammed.

“Fucking thing—!”

A metal clink drew his gaze. Inches away, a spent bullet was caught mid-fall, hovering like time had hiccupped. It dropped with a soft clang.

In his ear, a whisper:
“Pa jodia, zanmi’m.”

Not today, my friend.

A screaming rocket. A curse. Then Chayson collapsed, groaning.

The boat lurched.

Jackson ran. Skidded. Boots sloshed through thick blood. He hit the wheel, grabbed the throttle. Looked up.

There—through parted leaves—was a figure.

Black pyjamas.

RPG-7 braced on their shoulder.

Jackson spun the wheel. Slammed the throttle. The boat twisted hard.

He aimed the prow straight at the rocketeer, staring into his dark eyes.

The engine howled. Metal screamed.

FWUMP.

The rocket launched in fire and smoke.

Jackson jerked the wheel.

The boat listed, corrected.

Too late.

The grenade screamed toward him.

“Timoun Bata!”
(Devil’s Child!)

A voice—not his.

Then—

Flame. Heat. White light.

---

A few days later...

The two-star general arrived. Clean uniform. TV cameras in tow. He smiled wide. Practiced. Hollow.

Jackson stood at attention.

The man took his hand, soft and scented with cologne.

“Here’s your tin star, son,” he said for the cameras.

Jackson forced a smile.

The man turned, laughing, not waiting for a reply.

Behind Jackson, a nearby radio crackled to life. Clear. No static.

> “The Devil went down to Mekong,
Tryin’ to honor a deal,
He was in a bind, runnin’ outta time,
And lookin’ for a soul to steal.

He found a boy on a riverboat,
With fingers born to play,
But the kid went to war, tried to settle the score,
And the Devil don’t like to wait.”

 “‘You play real sweet, son,’ he said,
‘But you’re runnin’ outta track—
I got time, and blood, and the long way back.
And you? You owe me that.’”

Jackson turned around.
Picked up the battered case.
Drew back his arm...

...and threw the damn thing in the river.

Epilogue:

The stars hung low over Firebase Endzone, heavy and watching.

Jackson sat alone on a sandbag wall, boots untied, rifle across his lap like a sleeping child. The ribboned medal weighed awkwardly on his chest, a tin lie he hadn’t yet found the courage to take off.

In his hand, a match flared. He didn’t remember striking it.

The scent—sulphur and tobacco—wasn’t his.

There's plenty of free parking and the inside is very nice! I've gone three times now and it has spoiled me when it comes to comparing it to other Amtrak stops.

One of the best parts is that you just walk straight onto the train, no stairs!! It's really convenient for our seniors and those with a lot of heavy luggage.

Someone did say that they close during certain hours so just be mindful of that when you have to pick someone up or be picked up. Otherwise you'd be waiting outside.

I think if they added a little coffee Cafe it would be super cute!

I ended up hanging out with some high school friends, people I don’t even see often, maybe once every six months. (Not gonna lie, I didn’t really like most of them.)

Anyway, we went out around 11 p.m. to grab food at a restaurant, and our waitress turned out to be someone who also went to our high school. She used to be a really close friend, one of the first people I ever truly opened up to. The last time I remember seeing her was back in 2018 when we got coffee and had a really deep conversation. After that, we just drifted apart.

I was caught off guard seeing her again, especially since I was kind of high and later had a couple beers. I got shy, but I cracked a couple jokes and she laughed. I didn’t say much else and ended up just going home.

Two days later, I messaged her and asked if she wanted to catch up. She responded really warmly, something like “OMG yes! I loved seeing you! We should definitely catch up.” She told me she was about to travel out of the country for a few weeks, but she said she’d love to meet up when she gets back. I told her to reach out when she’s back so we can plan something.

So now I’m wondering:

1.	⁠How would you personally interpret a reconnection like this after years apart, friendly or romantic?
2.	⁠Would you keep the DM conversation going while she’s away, or give it space and wait until she’s back?

No food
No phone (especially Reddit!)
Just Bible study with prayer to receive revelation.

The camp that day was too busy—too alive for the heat. Shouted orders echoed across the clearing, punctuated by the wet thumps of boots sinking into orange mud. The air hung thick and unmoving—like a well-fed snake, it slithered slow, unhurried. No breeze stirred the dark green leaves or the broad, swaying palms high above in the treeline. Even under stretched canvas, there was no relief.

Every surface gleamed with a slick sheen of damp. You could fight heat with water, sure—hydration was key. Water cooled the body, flushed the system. But this… this wasn’t heat alone. This was a stew of humidity, the kind found in a kitchen that never stops boiling lobsters, crabs, and corn. Imagine that—and you’re halfway there.

Foot care had been drilled into them back at boot camp, over and over. But no one mentioned how fatigues would rub and chafe in all the wrong places—how armpits would blaze raw, rashes bloom around your waist like angry halos. No one said you could get jungle rot on your balls—raw, weeping sores that stank like a week-dead fish abandoned on the riverbank.

But hey—as long as your feet were dry, as long as you had clean socks and could still walk straight on patrol, everything was peachy, right?

If it had been quiet, maybe you could’ve coped. Just lie still, soak up some rays. But no—the noise made it worse. Ammo boxes dropped like bricks. Grunts shouting over trenches, laughing, cussing, singing off-key to a radio that crackled more hiss than harmony.

Hueys whupped low over the sediment-heavy river, their rotors barely shifting the dense air. That same air was thick with layers of scent: the sweet-pungent tang of gasoline, smoke from woodfires, the acrid burn of overheated engines—and through it all, the underlying stink of the river: sewer-sweet, rotten.

On the makeshift wharf, thrown together by the engineer corps, sat Jackson.

The boys called him Birdie—on account of his whistling. At reveille, in the latrine, cleaning his rifle—it didn’t matter. He whistled like a songbird that hadn’t yet realized it was caged.

Now he sat as if behind a piano in some smoky, back-alley jazz club. Perched on a box of .50 cal rounds, back straight, head nodding to a rhythm only he could hear. Arms bent. Fingers moving swift and sure across an imaginary keyboard—just him and the crate, keeping time.

The radio crackled, hissed—and then, miraculously, cleared. A change in tune.
“Mack the Knife.”
Ella Fitzgerald’s voice slid through the static—smooth, warm, honeyed.

Jackson’s fingers stilled.
He drifted away…

---

Three days before his eighteenth birthday, Jackson stood at the crossroads.

It was the last day of May, heat rising from the land in slow, lazy waves—not yet unbearable in his home state of Louisiana. He stood at the heart of a four-way crossroads, seven or eight miles from his family’s farm. Close to midnight, he reckoned. A waning moon cast soft blue-white light over the scene, bathing the world in an eerie, ethereal glow.

Cotton fields stretched out on all sides, the earthy, musty scent of the crop thick in the night air. He wasn’t quite a man—not yet—but he aimed to become one real soon. The gravel crunched beneath his thick leather boots as he paced in a tight circle, nerves ticking through his limbs. One hand ran over his sweat-dampened scalp, across his tight, coarse black curls.

He’d heard his uncle talk about Robert Johnson when he was just a boy. The tale hadn’t scared him like it was meant to—it had stuck. Haunted him. Played over in his mind through long, hungry years. Because how else was he supposed to lift his daddy and momma out of the dirt?

His father, old before his time, hunched and weathered, hands thick with calluses from a life behind the plough and with little to show for it. His mother—oh, his poor momma—cooking and cleaning at the big house for folks still pretending the world hadn’t turned.

He stopped pacing. Looked down at his hands—slim, agile fingers.
""You got talent, boy!"" they’d said. Plenty of times. But talent wasn’t enough. Talent opened the door; luck decided if you got invited in.

With a heavy sigh, Jackson rubbed his sweaty palms down the legs of his rough wool trousers.
""I’m too old for fairy tales,"" he muttered.

He cast one last look down the three roads in front of him, about to turn back—when he heard it.

Footsteps on gravel behind him. Then a melodic whistle, lilting and slow.
It stopped him cold.

Spinning on his heel, a little puff of dust rising, Jackson’s wide eyes locked onto a stranger.

The man strolled toward him with lazy confidence, a black cane balanced across his shoulder. Though the night air was warm, a chill wrapped itself around Jackson's spine. His breath caught in his chest—his heart thumped like a brass drum being struck from the inside.

The stranger came to a halt a few feet away. He wore a tall hat—Jackson remembered hearing it called a stovepipe once—and stood a little taller, a little broader than Jackson himself. A long, knee-length coat hung off his shoulders, its dark cloth near-black beneath the moonlight. Beneath it, a cotton shirt lay open at the collar, a loose cravat drooping beneath his neck.

Lowering the cane, the man lifted his hat’s brim and offered a low, sweeping bow. His face, now free of shadow, tilted up—meeting Jackson’s gaze.

His eyes gleamed dark and deep, like coals dancing behind glass. Sharp cheekbones framed his face, a short curly beard lining a strong jaw. His smile was wide and easy, too perfect to be safe.
“Late for one so young, mon cher, to be out in these fields, yes?”

His voice rolled like thick molasses, sweet and smooth. Jackson said nothing.

“Ah… such shyness,” the man crooned, tilting his head, grin never faltering. “Come now, petit, tell us why you’re here, eh?”

The cane flicked up, then gently tapped Jackson’s shoulder. Not hard—but enough to stir him from the spell.

Jackson blinked, swallowed, managed to close his slack mouth. “I—I don’t…”

The stranger laughed—a rich, velvet sound—and began to circle Jackson with an odd, stalking gait, the way a predator tests a meal it doesn’t yet intend to eat.

“Not yet a man, no,” he said, voice almost purring. “But close, oui? I see why you came. You seek old Clooty, yes? Come, boy. Tell us what you want. Say it clear.”

Jackson saw it then—not with his eyes, but with the longing in his soul.

He saw crowded clubs, packed tight with people cheering, clapping, screaming to hear him play. He saw record deals, stacks of money, a suit that fit him like it was made from starlight. He saw his father in fine clothes, standing tall. His mother smiling like she hadn’t smiled in years.

A warm, dry whisper tickled his ear.
“Sign here, mon cher. I have the pen.

---

A sharp whistle snapped Jackson back to the present.

He was still perched on that munitions box, his fatigues soaked through—especially under the arms and across his back—dark with sweat and clinging like second skin.

“Yo! Birdie! C’mon, man—let’s hustle! We got eighty clicks of sewage and green hell ahead of us. Grab that brick your ass is on and get aboard!”

Jackson blinked. Rubbed the heat from his eyes. He snatched up the M16 propped beside him, then hefted the heavy .50 cal ammo box onto his shoulder. A quick nod—a soldier’s farewell—and he climbed aboard the olive-drab and jungle-camouflaged gunboat.

Let’s get some, he thought.

---

Night fell fast in the jungle. No lingering, romantic sunsets here—just light one minute, then darkness like a dropped curtain.

After an uneventful patrol upstream, Captain Chayson—Chay to the men—ordered the riverboat close to shore. A short while later, they slipped into an RPB, a makeshift rest post thrown together by the engineers just days ago. Sandbags, broken crates, and sheets of corrugated metal made up a crude dock. They tied up against another boat headed downriver, and Jackson was handed watch duty—alone with both crafts.

The rest of the crew had vanished just before dusk, laughing and ribbing him on their way out.
Old man Chayson had chewed him out earlier over something Jackson still swore wasn’t his fault.
“That was my lucky coffee mug, Bird. And you decided to throw it overboard?”
Those piercing steel-blue eyes of Chay’s had sparkled with mischief, sure—but the spit flying from his mouth and flecking his beard? That hadn’t matched the tone.
Jackson had protested. Last he saw, the mug had been on the map table, leaving brown rings on the charts.

At least Adams—solid, steady Adams with two tours already behind him—had slipped him a couple Lucky Strikes and a Hershey bar before leaving.

Jackson tipped his helmet back slightly and spat into the swirling black of the Mekong.

He lit a cigarette, letting the smoke fill his lungs. The orange-red tip flared, briefly casting a glow against his cheek. He held it in, then exhaled slowly into the thick, still air.

Sitting by Chayson’s wheel, he flicked the butt into the undergrowth. It sparked once against a wet stump—then the jungle swallowed it whole. All was quiet now. A few sounds had floated down earlier—some guys arguing over cards, no doubt—but the silence had settled back like a shroud.

Only the occasional creak from the tied ropes or the groan of the metal hull kept him company as the current rolled past.

Jackson leaned his head against the cool metal rail, eyes scanning the black water. The stillness crept into his bones.

“Shit!” he cursed, a little too loud.

Something with too many teeth had landed on his neck and bit deep. He slapped at it hard—but froze as he heard it—

A sound.

Not the jungle. Not water.

A laugh.

Wet. Slippery. Wrong.

It came from behind him.


---

Jackson snapped alert, M16 gripped tight, swinging toward the sound.

Crouched on a crate, lashed down in the corner of the boat, was a man-shaped silhouette. But darker. Too dark. It swallowed light.

What chilled Jackson’s blood wasn’t the figure—it was the smile. Shark-like. Wide. Gleaming teeth lit from within, as if they remembered hellfire.

“Ah, my little zanmi,” it purred, the voice slipping out, languid and thick. “Why youse make old Clooty come to this dirty, hot country, huh?”

Jackson’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. He clutched his rifle tighter—not like a weapon, but like a crucifix.

The smile vanished. The silhouette shifted.

A match flared. A furnace of light in a closed fist. Sulphur bit the air.

“You—you’re—what the hell are you doing here?” Jackson managed to rasp.

Old Clooty, a slim lit cheroot pinched between thin lips, took a long drag and exhaled. The smoke curled unnaturally—floating, coiling, like it knew something.

He lowered the cheroot to his knee, still crouched. The glow revealed eyes—glistening. Hungry.

Jackson stared.

The helmet was standard issue—cloth-covered M1—tilted rakishly. Tucked into the band were two black aces and two black eights. Spades and clubs. The dead man’s hand.

His fatigues were crisp. Clean. No sweat stains. The company patch on each shoulder grinned—a demon’s head, baring sharp teeth. Beneath it, upside-down sergeant stripes. Where U.S. Army should be: “Devils Own.”

“You have something of mine, mon chéri,” Clooty said, voice dry as old paper.

His smile returned. He tilted his head. “We have a contract still, yes?”

Jackson stood straighter, sweat slick on his brow. The rifle eased slightly from his chest, though still held firm. His voice came stronger than he felt.

“You promised me fame. Fortune. Ain’t got neither. You can go pound sand. I got nothing for you. Hear me? Nothing.”

Clooty tipped his head back and laughed.

It was like someone tuning a violin with broken strings.

He brought his blazing gaze down and said, calm as sin, “Boy... you came knockin’ on my door. You don’t like my encore, moun fou? Difisil. Tough luck.”

He took another drag, blew a smoke ring that twisted into a noose.

“You take my offer. Come back with me. Neon lounge, baby grand, ivory keys still wet from the last girl who played ’em. Coin. Sweet-tasting bel fanm just for you. Refuse—”

He spat on the deck.

Jackson glared, lip curled, heart pounding.

Then—snap.

A branch behind him.

“Psst… Hey, Jackson. Chay says I’m to relieve you. Go find a hole, man. Who the hell you talkin’ to anyway?”

It was Adams, stepping from the undergrowth.

Jackson turned back.

The crate was empty.

But the cigar smoke still curled in the air. And it smelled like brimstone.

---

They passed a village the next day. Women washing clothes got doused with spray as the gunboat surged by. Some were knocked into the river. The crew—Chayson included—roared with laughter.

“C’mon, guys. Not funny,” Adams muttered, but his voice held no force.

Jackson said nothing, but his eyes lingered on the struggling women. He shook his head.

They were getting close to Firebase Endzone.

Or as the men called it: Devil’s Armpit.

The river narrowed, green choking in tighter, like a throat. Jackson leaned back near the wheelhouse. His skin prickled.

No birds. No monkeys. Nothing.

“Stand ready,” Chayson barked.

The banks rose. The boat felt smaller. Smothered.

Ahead, shadows moved. Black shapes in the foliage. Ducking down.

Crack!

Orange blooms lit the trees. Splinters of paint flew from the hull. Screams.

One sharp. One low and awful.

“Adams!” Jackson shouted, even as his finger squeezed the trigger.

Gunpowder stung his eyes. He smelled hot brass, oil, sweat.

The boat surged forward as Chayson gunned the engine, bow lifting. But it felt slow—like wading through glue.

Jackson’s rifle thumped against his shoulder. The jungle shredded with every shot.

Then—

Clunk.

His weapon jammed.

“Fucking thing—!”

A metal clink drew his gaze. Inches away, a spent bullet was caught mid-fall, hovering like time had hiccupped. It dropped with a soft clang.

In his ear, a whisper:
“Pa jodia, zanmi’m.”

Not today, my friend.

A screaming rocket. A curse. Then Chayson collapsed, groaning.

The boat lurched.

Jackson ran. Skidded. Boots sloshed through thick blood. He hit the wheel, grabbed the throttle. Looked up.

There—through parted leaves—was a figure.

Black pyjamas.

RPG-7 braced on their shoulder.

Jackson spun the wheel. Slammed the throttle. The boat twisted hard.

He aimed the prow straight at the rocketeer, staring into his dark eyes.

The engine howled. Metal screamed.

FWUMP.

The rocket launched in fire and smoke.

Jackson jerked the wheel.

The boat listed, corrected.

Too late.

The grenade screamed toward him.

“Timoun Bata!”
(Devil’s Child!)

A voice—not his.

Then—

Flame. Heat. White light.

---

A few days later...

The two-star general arrived. Clean uniform. TV cameras in tow. He smiled wide. Practiced. Hollow.

Jackson stood at attention.

The man took his hand, soft and scented with cologne.

“Here’s your tin star, son,” he said for the cameras.

Jackson forced a smile.

The man turned, laughing, not waiting for a reply.

Behind Jackson, a nearby radio crackled to life. Clear. No static.

> “The Devil went down to Mekong,
Tryin’ to honor a deal,
He was in a bind, runnin’ outta time,
And lookin’ for a soul to steal.

He found a boy on a riverboat,
With fingers born to play,
But the kid went to war, tried to settle the score,
And the Devil don’t like to wait.”

 “‘You play real sweet, son,’ he said,
‘But you’re runnin’ outta track—
I got time, and blood, and the long way back.
And you? You owe me that.’”

Jackson turned around.
Picked up the battered case.
Drew back his arm...

...and threw the damn thing in the river.

Epilogue:

The stars hung low over Firebase Endzone, heavy and watching.

Jackson sat alone on a sandbag wall, boots untied, rifle across his lap like a sleeping child. The ribboned medal weighed awkwardly on his chest, a tin lie he hadn’t yet found the courage to take off.

In his hand, a match flared. He didn’t remember striking it.

The scent—sulphur and tobacco—wasn’t his.

From the shadows, a whisper:

“Next time, mon ti zanmi… we play for keeps.”

A breeze stirred the heatless air.

The match died.

And Jackson, staring into the dark, wasn’t sure whether he was still alone.

Long post inbound.

I have the opportunity to buy my moms home in south shore Suffolk for like half the FMV. This would be in probably 1.5/2 years. At this point in time I have no other viable options for ownership, but I am expecting a big bonus (75% bonus) from work in a year, plus a raise at the end of this year but nothings guaranteed. I have some small savings currently but not house buying money. I live in Brooklyn and I’m happy where I am, but the rents keep going up…

My dilemma is a few fold: 

I am in a relationship, but it’s very unlikely she would wanna accompany all the way out there. Things can change and who knows, but I’d wager that I’d be going back to the island a single man in his mid 30s.

I currently work in Nassau, my job is very niche and any other company I could work for would be out of NYC, possibly some remote or hybrid. The commute for my current job would be better, but I don’t know if I plan on staying that long.  

I have a few friends on the island, but my best friends are all in NYC. Of course they would visit, but we all know people in the city don’t leave often.

I am pretty active in the local music scene, less so as I’ve gotten older, but it is still important to me. I grew up on LI and the local scene just is not my bag. No disrespect. 

Lastly, buying it and renting it out is off the table. A big part of why my mom wants to sell for so cheap is so that she can still have somewhere to come back to (she wants to move to fl). 

Now the pluses: The house is big and well maintained. It would give me a ton of room for my many hobbies. It has an in ground pool and a nice backyard. Lots of space to grow if I ever had a family. Could even rent a room while I’m there to make some extra change. It’s close by my two brothers and their families as well as my dad. It’s in a quiet area, and it is really nice to have a cup of coffee on the deck on summer mornings. Finally I would not have to worry about rent going up, constantly moving, and shitty landlords.

So I’m really split 50/50 here. I love Long Island for a lot of reasons, but I love the city for many too. Truthfully if I won the lottery today I’d be buying a brownstone, but I don’t think that’s happening so here I am, and I’m grateful to have the decision. I understand some people may think I’m crazy for considering not doing this, but I ask that you understand different strokes.

Tl;Dr: Great opportunity to buy childhood home as a single man in his 30s. Would you leave the city for this? ",28,1749062707.0,longisland,56,0.86,False

1l3dgla,https://www.reddit.com/r/HelixSleep/comments/1l3dgla/why_a_customized_mattress_actually_matters_and/,Why a Customized Mattress Actually Matters (and How Helix Helps You Find Yours),"Let’s be honest: buying a mattress shouldn’t feel like a shot in the dark.

But that’s how it goes for most people. You scroll endless reviews, lie on five beds in a showroom for 30 seconds each, and hope for the best. And that’s the problem, most mattresses are built to be “fine for everyone” but great for no one.

The truth is, “standard” mattresses are often designed to work for everyone. But in trying to please everyone, they end up being ideal for almost *no one*. At Helix Sleep, we’ve spent years working to solve that.

# Why Generic Mattresses Don’t Work for Most People

There’s a concept called the *myth of average*. It means that by trying to build something to fit *everyone*, it ends up fitting *almost no one* well. Sleep is personal. So is comfort. And your body and sleep habits aren’t identical to anyone else’s.

In fact, studies show that **only about 27% of people feel well-supported by generic, one-size-fits-all mattresses.** The rest? They’re either sinking too much, not getting enough support, or overheating through the night.

# How Personalization Actually Helps

Think of how you customize nearly every part of your life. Your coffee order, your jeans, your playlists. But most people still sleep on something completely generic, even though they’re spending 6–8 hours on it *every single night*.

Here’s why that matters:

* **Your sleep position** changes what areas of your body needs more or less pressure relief.
* **Your body type** changes how much support you need from foam or coils.
* **Your environment** (hot room, partner who moves a lot, etc.) can make or break your comfort.
* And if you have **pain, overheating, or tossing at night**, that’s often a sign your bed isn’t a match.

# What Helix Does Differently

We took the guess work out of trying to figure out what mattress you should get and built the [Helix Sleep Quiz](https://quiz.helixsleep.com/618eb09d56612) to make mattress personalization simple.

You tell us things you already know about yourself:

* Do you sleep on your side, back, or stomach?
* What’s your height and weight?
* Do you wake up with back pain or feel too hot at night?
* Do you prefer a soft, medium, or firm mattress?

We use that info to match you to a specific mattress built with the right:

* **Foam densities and coil zones** to improve spinal alignment
* **Comfort top layer** (soft, medium, or firm) to reduce pressure points
* **Cooling options** if you sleep hot
* **Durability upgrades** for heavier body types or shared beds

Behind the scenes, it uses our **Helix Color MATCH™ algorithm**, which we developed with sleep researchers and based on real customer data. It helps match your answers to one of our mattress designs, each built with a different mix of support layers, foam densities, and cooling upgrades.

The goal is to match you to your perfect mattress and avoid guessing. And ideally, to help more people actually wake up rested and pain-free.

# What Happens When You Actually Sleep on the Right Mattress?

Better alignment → better sleep.  
Customized comfort → fewer wake ups.  
A mattress that fits → mornings that don’t hurt.

In fact, **people who sleep on a Helix mattress report a 36% increase in quality of sleep**. That’s deeper rest, more REM cycles, and a noticeable difference in how your body feels when you wake up.

# The Bottom Line

A mattress that fits your body and sleep style isn’t a luxury,  it’s a basic building block of better sleep. Whether you have been thinking our getting a new bed or not, it’s worth taking a step back and asking:

* Do I wake up feeling rested or sore?
* Do I know what firmness or support my body actually needs?
* Have I ever really tried a mattress built *for me*?

After thinking it over, what’s the one thing you’d change about your current mattress to make it perfect for you?

(#soulmate #soinlove #oneimgonnamarry #loveofmylife #alwaysandforever) -- massive eyeroll now, like so much that you see the white of my eyes.

So, this is how it started--- we were both 13 years old sitting in a freezing cold science room for our freshmen orientation night. I was a very outgoing, bubbly, happy person. Them they were dark, mysterious and kept to themselves and hated everyone. I was sitting towards the front of the room by the windows and there she sat at the back of the room with her screaming little brothers and her mother standing behind her telling her off in Spanish. She caught the flash of my pearly whites and responded with a middle finger and a ""What the hell are you looking at, b?"". Our first interaction was one for the books for sure. For the next few years her and I got closer and became close friends. We had classes together and would even hangout after school at their house. That was until I got a boyfriend. That stuck a huge wedge between us for some reason. At the time I didn't realize that she liked me just as much as I liked her. She was always telling me all about her boyfriend and showed me pictures of him. But, I had never met him or saw him in person. So, I never tried to cross any boundaries. I assumed she was boo'd up and I had a boyfriend too so... anyways that's only part of the problem at that point in time.

Later my boyfriend, who was much older than me at the time was telling me just how much my friend was really into him. She apparently tried to make a move on him while he dropped her off one night. He showed me missed calls from her number. This infuriated me, why would she be calling him and how could she be trying to sleep with my boyfriend? The next day at school I saw her walking towards me. She was dressed up and had makeup on. She had a huge grin on her face and was holding flowers. When she finally got close enough to me I let her have it with the I can't believe you! You knew he's my boyfriend and you go and do what you did!? I want nothing to do with you!! We are not friends! Her huge smile dropped from a cheesy grin to heartbroken with tears in her eyes. She dropped the flowers and stormed off. After that I saw her maybe 3 more times. She would give me the meanest looks and would flip me off. Then it was like she fell off the face of the earth. People said she dropped out.

Fast forward about 10 years.. I'm casually scrolling through facebook when I notice I've got a friends request from her. I've got so many thoughts going through my head. I took to messenger.. what's your story? Is what came to mind and was sent. It took her a week to respond. Out of all things to txt after ten years and a really bad fall out. Her birthday was coming and there was a party she text back and wanted me to attend. I declined. I couldn't help but to think this was a setup for humiliating her in high school. Her and I had been chatting. Caught up some. She was married at this time. Me, single as a Pringle and was mingling with many. That day came up. She asked me what I meant by you know what you did. I explained to her that my bf told me that she tried to bone him that night he brought her home from my place and that there were missed calls from her phone number. She explained that night that he took her home she was talking to him about how she dumped her boyfriend and that she had a huge crush on this girl at school and wanted to ask her out. He told her that she just needed a real man and tried to force himself on her. She explained that the missed calls were from her mom because he had called before a few times looking for me and her mom wanted to know what older man needed to be calling their house. He apparently would just keep calling and calling until someone picked up and would never leave a message on their answering machine. She also added that the girl she was gonna ask out was me. That cheesy grin she had, those flowers, makeup and all dressed up was to ask me out! She said she couldn't return to school after awhile because it hurt to much to see me around. But, she's married now and her husband is great. I couldn't help but to feel like such an idiot. I did confess my crush like feelings for her back then too and we both laughed about it.

Now, let's fast forward another 8 years. A lot has changed in our lives. She's now married to me, we have a daughter, house, dog. The whole cliché love story. I always texted her good morning and would go on a spew about just how much I loved her, you know setting the tone for the day. But, this day I didn't. My alarm didn't go off and I was running late for work. I threw clothes on and didn't even get to make her coffee or breakfast. I didn't even get to set her clothes out.. nothing was right about this morning. The night before her and I were arguing. She was in her office all night this night. On her phone late. I always waited to eat with her to make sure she ate. It was my love language. Anyways, she had just gotten home from a work trip that afternoon. We picked her up from the airport. She was extremely distant. Didn't even kiss our daughter. We made plans to have lunch as a family but, she just wanted to pick up something and go home. Understandable considering the long plane ride back home. Once we got home she was locked away in her office. We could hear her yelling and carrying on on her phone. It went on til the late hours of the night. I attempted to knock, sent her texts to come have some lazy love with me. Relax and watch a show and have some dinner. She finally responded with ""You're such a b! Can't you tell I'm on the phone I don't want them to hear you: it's my job!"". I decided I was just going to attempt to go to sleep when she came storming into our room. She was pacing the room and carrying on about how I don't understand how everything she does is going to split our family. I tried to get her to explain what she meant but she refused to explain and gifted me my birthday gifts. My birthday wasn't for another few months but she insisted. They were crystals. She told me I needed them because the next few months were going to be the worst for me. She then sent me a text of a food order she wanted and told me to go get food. When I got back she seemed fine. We had the tv on and chowing down on late night junk food in bed. It got later and she rolled herself over and stole all the covers for the last time. No kiss. No goodnight. No, I love you.

I stumbled into our house after a long day of it being off. I had sent her many text. Wondered why she hadn't responded. Many missed calls from me. It felt off the whole day. But, usually after her work trips she would always be far and few with text and calls because she said she was catching up on work. Which never made a lot of since if she was gone out of town for work. But, hey I was a trusting spouse. The house was quiet at first. Then I hear our daughter in her room. Came down the hallway and there my wife was on the floor unresponsive.

She died 3 days later. They pronounced her brain dead from a stroke that lead to a brain hemorrhage. I needed her phone to contact her work to let them know what happened. Her first contact when clicking into her numbers was ""Babe"". Babe!? I'm babe.. it got much worse. Those trips were get aways for her to see her other fiancés. I found videos, pictures, texts. Going through her things I found letters, rings. Some of these people had been in our house. Pictures of some of these people with our baby. She had multiple relationships with other people and she used our daughter to make these people think she was a single mom to get them to send her things and pay for trips. Many different email addresses, social medias, had many apps to use different numbers. She used to always ask me to let her take our daughter on her trips and I always refused. I dug deeper and found that she was planning on taking our daughter and leaving the states but she couldn't because she was legally married to me. The day after she died her sister called me and told me she was so sorry for all that her sister did to me but she always told her I was the good one and to love me right. I was like what!? Then she continued to tell me that I was family either way no matter what her sister did. Confused af, I began to realize her whole family knew she was seeing other people and they all kept it from me. They all had met some of these people she was seeing. There were pictures of them all at family functions that she left me home for. Her funeral was interesting to say the least. Her whole family came. A lot of people I had never seen before. A few exs. Some of which came to me to tell me she loved me most that she would never shake me. I went up to speak at her wake and told our love story and promised to take care of our daughter. I was too embarrassed to say what I really wanted to say. How she was a liar and a cheater. How I hated her so much for putting me in this situation. But, I didn't. I stood before her body and her family and lovers and told them how much we loved each other.

The whole time she was in the hospital I had to suck it up and make decisions that was best for her being even though she hurt me the deepest anyone could ever hurt anyone. I had to plan her funeral with her and her family and our daughter in mind. They wanted to see her one last time. They wanted a place to come see her. The funeral home even offered me a space to be buried with her once I passed years from now to be with my loved one in death. The betrayal is real. It's been a few years since she's died and I still have her affairs haunting me. They call, they text, they find me on social media demanding to see our daughter. For my daughter I show her pictures of her mom. Tell her how much she loved her. I keep her memory alive for her. But, honestly I wish I could just forget her and it all.",1,1749062079.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Or should I confront him first?,"Hello everyone! This is my first post on this subreddit, so pardon if my formatting is odd. I appreciate any and all advice you can give.

I work at a coffee shop and one of my coworkers has been making me super uncomfortable with his increasingly inappropriate comments and jokes. It started out after I told him I was nonbinary and he went on and on about how he loves dating AFAB-specific nonbinary people and that his current partner is also nonbinary. When that had originally happened, I had assumed that he was trying to show support but in a rather clueless way, as he always gave off the 'a little stupid but well-meaning' vibe.

After that interaction, however, he started to open up to me more and more about inappropriate/sexual topics. He confided in me that he was diagnosed hypersexual after some past sexual trauma. I was confused by why he wanted to confide that in me, but I didn't want to make him feel put-out or bad for sharing something vulnerable, despite how awkward the situation was. Then, he started talking about his sexual preferences and his past experience in SW through audio erotica voice acting. I had listened but didn't really engage in the conversation because I was caught off guard.

Ever since then, he started to make more and more sexual jokes or remarks. First, he complimented me on my music taste (I listen to metal/alternative music) and then shifted the conversation to how metal music is ""the best to have sex to"" and went on and on about which specific songs he preferred to listen to with his partner during sexual intimacy. Immediately, I tried to change the topic, but it took some effort to convince him to talk about something else. The next time, we were on bar together and he had made a comment about how every time he reaches around me to grab the milk for lattes, he was ""breathing on my neck"" and that it was creating sexual tension between us. I made a stern but dismissive remark about how we were ""just making drinks"" and carried on.

Then, yesterday, I had walked into the shop before my shift to get my staff drink. He had been working at the cash register and we had been making small talk before he interrupted me to tell me that the strap of my messenger bag (slung across both shoulders) was making my chest look huge (he had started the sentence with ""Not to be a pervert but...""). Feeling extremely awkward and thrown off, I just sort of laughed and ordered my drink. Then, later in the same shift, after I had clocked in, he had made a joke about how short I was (I am very much under average height unfortunately) and had said that I was shorter than his mom. I had grumbled about how my height genetics were sniped because of my dad being far shorter than my mom, and he had made the joke that my dad ""fucked me"" with being short. Then, he twisted it into a joke about my dad ""actually fucking me"" and I was so flabbergasted that I just left the area.

Having laid that all out, what should I do? I am afraid that my humoring nature has led him to believe that I am okay with him making sexual jokes or comments to me despite my true feelings. Especially with his diagnosis, I am hesitant to talk to my boss about his behavior, because I'm worried that he doesn't realize exactly how uncomfortable he's making me. But, at the same time, I've changed the topic and the conversation enough times that I hope that it would clue him in on how I feel about it. These comments and jokes are also just extremely inappropriate for a workplace environment. Further, because of how uncomfortable he has made me, I don't want to confront him, especially if he lashes out or dismisses my feelings. But I also don't want to take it to my boss and get him in trouble if he just needs to be told to stop.

What should I do? Should I report him to my boss for sexual harassment, or should I confront him myself first? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2,1749061850.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

How Secret Societies Manufactured Mysticism to Perfect Social Control","Secret societies don't preserve ancient wisdom. 

They manufacture consent for modern domination.

**Key Revelations:**

* All ""ancient"" traditions were forged in the last 400 years
* Masonic degrees exploit your pattern-completion compulsions
* Orphanages operated as loyalty factories targeting vulnerable children
* Your pattern-recognition creates mystical significance from deliberate manipulation
* Consciousness became a commodity requiring professional development
* Integration mythology prevents recognizing systematic exploitation

**The Bottom Line:** Your spiritual experiences are mechanical responses to environmental stimuli designed to trigger your meaning-generation systems. Every breakthrough, every transcendent moment, every sense of authentic development is biological machinery mistaking its own activity for contact with something beyond biological machinery.

There is no authentic development.

There is only mechanical processing generating temporary patterns that desperate survival programming converts into illusions of meaning, significance, and transcendent possibility.

I have never said anything bad to their face ever. There is also absolutely no paper trail to prove anything (i.e. no emails or messages of me saying mean things etc.). In fact quite the contrary, there is evidence of me offering this person coffees, inviting to team outings (team lunches) etc., checking in on things etc. 

The only wronging that I can possibly think of is that 8 months ago, I was with a small group of close colleagues and we discussed this person in the context of their performance and team contribution and I likely said something along the lines of ""they're useless and add nothing to the team"" (I've never said anything about race, gender etc , only about their performance) - whilst I'm not proud of the talking behind the back of a colleague I don't believe there is anything illegal behind what I said.

I've been invited to a investigation meeting next week (not a disciplinary) but I still don't understand what they could possibly have on me, unless my comments made to the small group of colleagues made the way around the gossip rumour mill in the company (and even then, it doesn't add up to harassment/bullying in my view).

I work in a regulated industry (insurance) so a dismissal would absolutely ruin my career. Been at this company for 6 years (England).

My main thing was walking. I don’t drive so I started walking so much anyways after I moved out of my parents house. Also biking. I’m from a southern state so it gets really hot in the summers, ofc I had to work so that never stopped me I sweat bucket loads. 

I drink mainly water/coffee. I will have a coke or soda from time to time. One cup of coffee a few days a week ( I don’t drink coffee everyday but often). And if I am in the mood for something other than water I usually do sweet tea or just a Gatorade. Overall though, water is my best friend. 

I still eat what I want, but I’ve always been a salad/veggie person bc I grew up around a garden. I try to just do portion control. I won’t promote this part but I don’t usually eat three meals a day (I don’t like breakfast food is why ) 

If I eat snacks I try to eat a smaller amount. Like for example I’m in the mood for some chips I’ll eat a little handful of the bag, then wait, maybe go back and another small handful. That way I can portion it I dont give myself all of it. 

I do struggle sometimes with motivation to workout, so I like to do high intensity. I do something that I can do fast pace, then stop for a little then start again. I don’t work out everyday but a few times a week I do probably about 20-30min. And of course a mix of walking and jogging regularly ! 

Motivation help: SUNLIGHT! even just going outside boost energy . VITAMINS! good for metabolism. WORKOUT VIDEOS! 

Also, stressing so much about how much weight you’re losing is gonna take a mental toll. Find something that feels good for you! You won’t see it all at once and it’s NOT HEALTHY to see any weight loss all at once. 

When I was at my biggest weight (320lb) I was depressed, and part of my weight loss was the discipline of making myself do something I didn’t want to do. I still even struggle with it, but changing small little things is bigger than you realize :)

1l3czus,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1l3czus/569_days/,569 Days,"There were 569 days between the first time I cleaned your room and the moment I realized I had to let go.  
  
569 days of growing up beside you, loving you the best way I knew how. Eventually, I learned that love isn't just a feeling. It's responsibility.

From the outside, it may not look like much. Two young people in different countries. Too many calls, too many late-night “I miss you”s. But from where I stood? Every moment with you felt like magic. Even the simple ones. Especially the simple ones. When you’d send me a selfie video or call me just to hear my voice, that was enough to make the entire day feel made.

You moved to Spain about a year into our relationship. The time difference, the busyness, it scared me. I didn’t want you to ever go a day without feeling loved. So I started writing you letters. Every day we were apart, you had a piece of my heart to read. Not because I was good at it, but because you mattered that much to me.

There was so much beauty in our beginnings. You were anxious, guarded, and brilliantly sharp. I was steady but searching. In a lot of ways, I was teaching you how to be loved. But I never wanted to change you. Not really. I loved you exactly as you were, beneath the walls, beneath the fear, all softness and spark. You were never a project. You were my person.  
  
I still remember the twin names. Stacey May and Nicolette, Colette, as we liked to call her. We dreamed of building an empire together. You’d be its queen. I’d be your safe place. We imagined our dream home, you said you wanted an art room where you could create, and right outside, a garden waiting to bloom under the sun. We believed in a future made of shared blankets and morning coffee and maybe even little feet running across wooden floors. Maybe even a stationery shop. You gave me hope I hadn’t felt in years.

But more than anything, you gave me God again.  
  
That’s something no one else has ever done for me. You showed me grace and faith not with sermons, but with the way you lived. The way you forgave. The way you held on. The way you believed. I never told you this the way I should’ve, but it changed everything for me. And I’ll always be thankful.

And yet… I failed you.  
  
I let fear speak louder than love.  
  
I lost my patience, raised my voice, made you feel small when you needed comfort.  
  
Worst of all, I threw your own pain back at you like a weapon. That’s something I’ll always regret. There are things I said that I can’t take back, but God, if I could, I would. A thousand times.

But I changed. Because of you, I changed.  
  
Not because of guilt. Not out of desperation. But because you deserved better.  
  
You deserved the version of me who finally understood that real love is a choice. It’s writing a letter every day even when I had no idea how to. It’s learning how to love someone the way they need, not the way that’s easy. It’s growing, not just after the fight, but in the steady rhythm of everyday love.  
  
I don’t know what I’m trying to write here.  
  
Maybe it’s not a goodbye. Maybe it’s a memory I want to hold onto a little longer.  
  
But if you ever read this, I hope you remember the love.  
Not the breakdowns or the distance or the hurt I caused.  
But the quiet afternoons snuggled up in bed, the promises whispered at midnight, the empire we almost built.  
  
I hope you remember that someone in this world still believes in you with everything he has.

569 days. It wasn’t a perfect story, but it was ours.  
And if I had to live it all again, even knowing how it ends, I would.

Because you taught me how to love.  
  
And more importantly, you made me believe I could be loved too.

1l3cyti,https://www.reddit.com/r/RestlessLegs/comments/1l3cyti/opinions_on_starting_ropinirole_without_seeing/,Opinions on starting Ropinirole without seeing neurology?,"Hi! Usually I'm just a Reddit lurker, but I'd love some input from people with experience going through the RLS journey on how to best manage my RLS while I'm waiting to get in to see neurology.  I am scheduled to see a doctor who is double boarded in neurology and sleep medicine.

I went to my primary care doc a month ago, after several weeks of unbearable restless legs at night that kept me up. It's every night for me, although some nights are worse than others. She agreed that it sounds like I check all the boxes for restless leg syndrome but that she doesn't actually have any experience diagnosing and treating RLS so she isn't exactly sure what to do. She referred me to neurology, did some basic labs, and offered to write me a script for Ropinirole. My iron was low end of normal at 48 ug/dL, ferritin low end of normal at 42 ng/mL, and moderately low saturation at 13%. My primary care doc has been largely unhelpful, said these results were probably due to just coming off my menstrual cycle and recommended taking a multivitamin and eating a high iron diet. I already was doing those things, so I read the American Academy of Neurology and American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines and decided to put myself on an additional 45 mg iron supplement with some extra Vit C, for a total of  63 mg iron daily. I also cut out melatonin at night, rarely drink alcohol, limit myself to one cup of coffee in the morning, and cut back to half a zyrtec per day for my allergies. After a month of trying this, still no relief! I've found a few things that help a little, but not enough to get a good night's sleep. Magnesium, cannabis, and compression leg massagers before bed have been the only things that have given me a little bit of relief, but the restlessness always comes back in the middle of the night once those effects have worn off. 

I still have another 6 weeks to go before my neurology appointment, and I'm not sure whether I should tough it out and wait until I see the neurologist to start any new treatments, or if I should take up my primary care doctor on her offer to prescribe me Ropinirole. My initial gut feeling was to wait until I see neurology given the potential side effects of Ropinirole, the complexity that there seems to be in diagnosing and treating RLS, and the fact that I haven't really had a formal evaluation to make sure this is a correct diagnosis for me. But the longer this drags on, the more desperate I am for relief, and now I'm thinking maybe a trial of Ropinirole is worth it and the neurologist can always modify my treatment as they see fit.

So fellow RLSers, what would you do in my position? TL;DR: should I let my primary care doc prescribe me ropinirole to try and help while I wait to get in to see a neurologist? Any opinions or suggestions are welcome!",1,1749061326.0,RestlessLegs,2,1.0,False
1l3cy8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1l3cy8s/assemblying_a_large_plexiglass_display_case/,Assemblying a large plexiglass display case,"Hello,

I live in a very dusty environment and all my lego sets tend to build up lots of dust after just a few weeks, therefore I started looking into plexiglass display cases. However, the custom made ones I found are wildly expensive (often more than the sets themselves), but it's just 5 panels of transparent plastic assembled in a simple shape. I looked up a nearby store, and I could get such panels for under 40€ (instead of spending over 250€ just for one case).

Most tutorials I looked up are about assembling small cases, up to 30x30x30 cm (width x length x height), where a bonding agent is often sufficient to hold everything still. However, my sets are very big (mostly ships, so they tend to be long and tall. I calculated that I would need **30x60x70 cm** case for the largest ship) and especially one of them fills an entire coffee table, so ideally the display case would be **50x80x60cm**.

For such large dimensions, I doubt a thin strip of glue is going to securely hold everything together. I'm also unsure if the top of such cases could be subject to bending, if the panels are only 3 mm thick. Looking at similar enclosures made of other materials, I often see the use of wedges placed in all 8 corners to keep everything secure, but I wonder what's the best approach here, especially if they need to be occasionally lifted and removed. Would a base with notches where to lodge the individual panels be a potential solution? I'm mostly after a practical solution (I even considered using wobbly PVC thin sheets as temporary covers, so if you got better and cheaper alternatives, let's hear it).

I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn’t even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that’s what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou’s guys their morning pleasantries.

“Morning, Brandon”

“Morning, Jo”

“How are you today?”

“Living the Dream”

“You’re dream or someone else’s?”

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we’ve had about a thousand times now.

(It’s too bad.)

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at “Lou’s Plumbing and Heating Co.” Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

“Here comes the straggler!” says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn’t say walk. It’s more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He’s a dick. He’s also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He’s been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

(Lies.)

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything…

“Holy shit, you know how to read?” says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice “Well you’re one to talk, didn’t your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn’t even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.”

“Ladies please”

In walks Bill. He’s our boss and Lou’s adopted brother.

“What my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.” I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

“Hey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?”

“We’re not just decommissioning it, we’re replacing it, Jo.”

“How are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.”

(They're all burning.)

“We’ve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you’ll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

“Fuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?”

“I didn’t like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.”

“So why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?”

“We came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial”

“Uh huh, how big is the contract?”

“Twelve million”

“Shouldn’t it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?”

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the “supply chain issues” and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

“Are we removing the old boiler?”

“Not exactly, we’re going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.”

Whatever you do won’t work. It will happen again.

“When can I see the plans?”

“Next week, I’ll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.”

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we’ve had since 1987. We’re real cavemen here at Lou’s. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I’m pretty sure it’s just so the old bat, who’s been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She’s a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

“So Darryl, what do you have for me?”

“Remember Frank?”

“Frank Sinatra?”

“No Farmer Frank, your best buddy.”

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he’s my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

“Okay, what’s going on at my buddy’s place?”

“His wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn’t do anything to help his situation.”

“Why am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.”

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I’m more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

“He asked for you, he’s been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It’s a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.”

“Sounds good.”

“And take Mini Zeke with you. Can’t leave the boy sheltered all day and I can’t send him with Turd.”

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn’t hear what Darryl said.

(He hears everything.) I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He’s a wizard. He can look at a system that’s just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was…

Interesting.

“Johnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.”

“Why the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,” he said angrily.

“Greedy fucker.”

“Lou never listens when we tell him anything.”

“Ain’t that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That’s an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there’s never enough heat coming out of them.” I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, “Because when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.”

I chuckled at that.

“Whatcha laughing about boy?”

“Remember the old Angel Fire commercials?”

“Fucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.”

We’re the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

“He gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.”

“You don’t work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven’t changed. Sure they’ve gotten smaller, more ‘efficient’, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we’ll get the call saying it’s too cold. Lou’s pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. “Nobody makes a furnace for our weather, it’s -50 some days, and 30 above the next.” He’s right when you’re dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they’re selling at the supplier they’re great. The only issue is that they get too hot…” he trailed off.

“So what do you figure is wrong with Frank’s? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?”

“Nah, Franks a smart old fucker, he’d have checked that. He only calls if he can’t figure it out.”

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

“I reckon it’s the burner box, there’s a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I’ve only ever changed one in 40 years.”

“So why do you think it’s that then?”

“Cause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that’s why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.”

(When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.)

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou’s part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn’t work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

“Oh yeah, I’ve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou’s. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.”

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

“Don’t talk about The Plant.”

“Sorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.”

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. “Let’s check the barn”

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They’re big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

“That must be Frank,” Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

“Hey, Frank!”

“Well, how are you now boys?”

“Good and you?” Me and Mini said at the same time.

“Better since you two are here.”

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70’s, still spry for an old fella.

(Tic toc, tic toc.)

“I don’t know what’s wrong with the damn thing, I can’t get it to light, I can’t get the pump to go.”

“Me and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.”

“Good luck boys”

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn’t get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could’ve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must’ve been my imagination.

“Well Mini, want to try the thermal reset?” “I thought you said there’s no way it’s the thermal reset.”

“Well, is it possible I was wrong and there’s only one way to cut power to the entire system and it’s through that reset, right?”

“Well yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,” he says as a smirk appears on his face. “Smart ass”

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. “Where is it?”

“I don’t know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he’s got a manual for this thing?”

“Sure.”

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. “So does he have anything?”

“Says he might have it in his attic. He’ll come over if he finds it.”

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

“Here’s the manual boys.”

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It’s said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

(4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.)

“Thanks, Frank”

Frank walked back to his tractor

“Alright Mini, keep cleaning, I’m going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me”

“Must be nice, sit in the heat and I’ll stay out here and freeze.”

“Shouldn’t have been a smart ass then.”

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

(When hell freezes over.)

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

“How the fuck did Johnny change that?” I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

“What’s up, buddy?”

“Look.”

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

“Yea?”

“I found it in the furnace.”

He paused

“Underneath it was the thermal reset switch.”

“What’s wrong Mini?”

“It felt warm when I grabbed it.”

“Furnace could’ve still been holding some heat.” I reassured him.

“Sure. That’s why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.”

“I’ll go talk to Frank about it. Don’t worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It’s getting late.”

I’d started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it’s just my imagination. It must’ve taken longer to get here than I thought.

“Fucking Lou should’ve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.”

Customers don’t like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

“Hey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.”

“My dog?” He solemnly chuckled

“Sadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.”

“I’m sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?”

“Yeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn’t want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.”

He laughed sadly again.

“I couldn’t help noticing, but the…” Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

“That’s my wife. She went missing last year… the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.”

“I’m so sorry to hear that again Frank.” “It’s alright, she wasn’t herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn’t my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I’m sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I’ll let you get back to work.”

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

“Huh, must’ve been a longer chat than I thought.”

Mini was covered in soot.

“Hey Mini, are you running for office with that face?”

“No.” He said curtly

“What’s wrong buddy?”

“I just want this job to be done. I want to go home.”

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. “Damn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.”

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. “Mini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.” The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

“That was easy. Got the new one?”

“Here.”

And with that, it was in.

“Mini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.” As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

“Mini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I’ll go fire on the pumps inside.”

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

(H) (E) (L) (L) (F) (R) (E) (E) (Z) (E) (S) (O) (V) (E) (R)

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

“Huh, didn’t think that walk was very long. Must’ve been my imagination.”

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

“Don’t fucking creep up and scare me like that, you’ve done that four times already.”

“I think you're going crazy buddy, here I’ll take the bill and tell Frank he’s all good.”

(Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.)

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

(And close the door.)

I shouted

“FRANK!”

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

I too have a scar. From you, not him. And while mine is not anything you can physically see or touch, I swear it's there.

I can't imagine you're having fun in there. And I could do without the scar. But I can hear my stomach gurgle as my morning coffee and eggs digest, and I can look down and ask ""how's it going!?""

1l3cury,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1l3cury/addresding_the_marketing_line_from_anh_kafe_in/,Addresding the marketing line from Anh Kafe in Thailand. We were deeply misinformed about the whole thing.,"To sum up the situation first

u/Armlife recently made a post https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/s/COG80XVSMk here which has a marketing board in Thai saying ""You guys think we were poor in the past, but now we're opening a huge Vietnamese coffee shop in the middle of Bangkok! Do you feel sad?""

This prompted many reactions in the comment saying this is nationalism and the stores are biting into it and this is shameful. 

However one comment stood out to me which is from u/ngocminh12697 which said it's a meme phrase for a new shop.

Seeing this I got out my google translate and translated the line, the FB line said smt like :""This is a popular marketing strategy in Vietnam but it hurts. They should have hired a Thai interpretor."" Interesting, popular marketing strategy in Vietnam? Are they talking about nationalism or something else here? 

With that I got to work, and oh boy did it shock me 

After doing research about this whole thing, I found a very particular ad with the catchphrase being: ""Linh ơi! Ngày xưa em chê anh nghèo, giờ anh mở hẳn salon tóc lớn nhất L.K. Linh! Em hối hận chưa?'"" 

It roughly translates to ""Linh!! Back then you told me I was poor. Now I open the largest salon in L.K. Linh! Do you regret now?"". Very close to the advertising line on the billboard isnt it? 

Apparently this was a trend for a while because while researching I found 2 facebook posts also using this catchphrase 

https://www.facebook.com/share/15a9cLaLit/

https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16SNxtQdTr/

And I also found a post from vietnamese news outlet thanhnien talking about this(remember to remove the dot between thanhnien since reddit blocks thanhnien links) 

https://thanh.nien.vn/quang-cao-la-thanh-hot-trend-tren-mang-xa-hoi-ke-thich-nguoi-che-185231208170213307.htm

From all of this, it seems to me that it was less of nationalism but rather a marketing stunt gone wrong. They tried to be trendy using a popular Vietnamese marketing catchphrase but it turned out wrong for Thai which made them sound cocky and nationalistic. It also explains why the Facebooker in the image said they should have hired a Thai interpretor instead. 

In conclusion, I think many of us deeply misunderstood the situation including me and worsened it. We were misinformed or not informed enough about the whole thing and quickly jumped to conclusions based on our biases. The store meant no actual harm and wasnt trying to nationalistic or cocky, it was simply a marketing ploy gone wrong.

1l3cqzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowVDisscussions/comments/1l3cqzd/review_9_supergirl_season_4/,Review 9: Supergirl Season 4,"Season 4 opens with Kara flying throughout the world, fulfills her day-to-day role as Supergirl. Kara has stayed busy in her heroic duties working with the D.E.O., and as a reporter at CatCo proving she can multitask. In one instance she catches a Balloon for little girl, goes to Kaznia and stops a runaway train in another. Kara flies back in time for a press conference than President Marsdin is givng. Kara gives Lena a bottle of Kaznian Vodka. Things seem to be peaceful overall......I said seem. Otis (played by Robert Baker) and Mercy Graves (played by Rhona Mitra) attack an alien named Dr. Vose and steal an EMP device from his lab. J'onn believes this to be a hate crime, with the rise of anti-alien hatred in the country (Season 3 planted the seeds for said hatred). Kara disagrees with J'onn, citing the Alien Amnesty Act and the equal rights in the World. Kara sees hatred closely and realizes J'onn is right and apologizes, asking for his help in dealing with the hate crimes. J'onn declines, saying he's committed to being a man of peace (J'onn left the DEO at the end of Season 3 to help alien citizens and find peaceful solutions). 

At the DEO, Alex adjusts to having Brainy on the team, he's proving to be a challenge. He's doing everything too literally, even trying to be like Winn (Who left at the end of Season 3 to go the Future with the Legion). Alex tries to be Patient with Brainy, eventually he figures it out a balance. A new employee joins CatCo, Nia Nal had worked in DC for Press Secretary Cat Grant in the Marsdin Administration. Nal has a degree in international relations from Georgetown University. She's sent to CatCo so that Kara could take Nia under her wing. When Kara first meets Nia, the latter drops coffee all over the floor. Kara says to her ""Oh my god, you're me"".

Olivia Marsdin (played by Lynda Carter) is forced to resign as President of The United States due to being exposed as an alien. Vice President Phil Baker (played by Bruce Boxleitner) became the next President of the US. Paranoid against more alien crises and his dropping ratings in the polls, Baker turned around the country's policy on anti-alien movements, putting him at odds with the D.E.O[.](https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/D.E.O.) and Supergirl.  Tensions rise, and anti-alien sentiment increases more and more. Later, A new leader steps in to relieve Director Alex Danvers on the orders of Baker, Colonel Lauren Haley (played by April Parker Jones). 

Haley is determined to find out Supergirl's identity, despite the fact that the D.E.O. keeps her off the books. Haley finds out that Supergirl is Kara Danvers, forcing the latter and Alex to seek J'onn's help. They want him to wipe the Colonel's mind of Kara's Identity. They realize that J'onn views it as a form of rape and that he swore not to do it again (he wiped someone's mind back in season one of the memory of he seeing J'onn). J'onn agrees to do it since Kara and Alex are family, but he cannot erase Haley's intent. At least this buys some time until they figure out what to do next. The next day, the colonel comes in with truth seekers, creatures that bring the truth out of someone, or kill a liar. 

Now comes a new plan, J'onn now has to wipe the memories of the D.E.O of their knowledge of Supergirl's secret Identity. Alex offers to leave the D.E.O, Kara tells her ""You need to stay and fight Haley from within"". Reluctantly Alex agrees to the mind wipe, but not before she and Kara cry together on the couch as they both know what it means. Alex wouldn't remember that Kara is an alien, let alone Supergirl. This is a big chunk of their sisterhood taken away, thereby creating a half relationship. With Alex's memory wiped, even fewer people know the truth about Kara.

Over the course of this season, we see the Children of Liberty, led by Ben Lockwood/Agent Liberty (played by Sam Witwer) a terrorist group determined to get rid of aliens. Lockwood is the former host of The Lockdown and a Former history professor at National City University. Lockwood's dad George died months prior in Reign's terraforming. Lydia died at the hands of an Alien, whose husband was wrongfully arrested by Children of Liberty.

We also meet Manchester Black (played by David Ajala) this season, a pro-alien human from England and football hooligan turned vigilante. Manchester's fiancé was an empathic alien, Fiona Byrne therapy sessions for aliens at Al's Dive[ ](https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Al%27s_Dive_Bar_(Earth-38))Bar, which J'onn attended. Fiona was later captured by Agent Liberty, who sought to use her psychic powers for the Children of Liberty's anti-alien agenda. When the plan failed, Fiona was killed. You can imagine Manchester would be very angered and hurt that. Manchester sets out to kill the Children of Liberty, including their leader, and anyone who gets in his way. Manchester is killed by J'onn using the Staff of H'ronmeer (also known as the Staff of Kolar) in vengeance as his believes Manchester shot James Olsen.

Towards the End we meet Lex Luthor (played by Jon Cryer) and see the entirety of his plans. He set in motion many of the events in this season. The President and Ben Lockwood are in cahoots with Lex. Eve Tessmacher had been secretly working for Lex for years. Kara's duplicate from the end of season 3 now named ""Red Daughter"" is residing in Kaznia and has been fed Propaganda and lies so that she'd do Lex's dirty work. He plans to use Red Daughter as a weapon against the US, to discredit Supergirl, and make himself a hero. Lex had exposed himself to radiation, then had Lena create a cure for him made from Harun-El (Black Kryptonite). Lockwood gave himself injections of Harun-El to make himself stronger. Once Supergirl defeats Lex Luthor, Lena removes the Harun-El from his system and shoots him. Lex has the last laugh; he had recorded evidence the Kara Danvers is Supergirl.

Also, this season, we get the Elseworlds crossover, which begins with The Flash 5X08, Continues with Arrow 7X08, and ends with Supergirl 4X08. Elseworlds sets the scene for Crisis on Infinite Earths next season. Mar Novu appears twice this season of Supergirl, he's in Elsewords Part 3, and The Quest for Peace. 

Casting: Our main cast led by Melissa Benoist returns this season, with some changes. Jeremy Jordan left at the end of Season 3, with Winn joining the Legion in the 31st Century. Jesse Rath joins the main cast as Querl Dox/Brainiac 5. Rath does a terrific job as the Coluan 12th level intellect. History is made this season with the introduction of Nia Nal, played by Nicole Maines. Maines, a transgender performer herself, plays the Arrowverse's first Transgender character, and DC's first TG superhero. Maines played Nia beautifully. Bruce Boxleitner plays President Phil Baker and does a great job too. Boxleitner famously portrayed Captain John Sheridan in Babylon 5. Interestingly enough, Baker had been cast with Brent Spiner in the role, the latter had to back out due to other commitments. David Ajala (Manchester Black) would go on to do Star Trek: Discovery as Cleveland Booker. Jon Cryer makes his debut as Lex Luthor. Cryer was perfectly cast as Lex and held his own as an antagonist against Melissa's Supergirl. The whole cast was terrific. 5/5

Writing: One of the four best seasons of my favorite series. Jessica Queller likely did her best work as showrunner here. Lots of high stake's action and drama, yet we still have plenty of humor and heart. Alex and Kara's relationship is literally split in half this season. On one hand you have the family dynamic of the Danvers sisters that's held strong for the previous 15 years, On the other, there's a piece of that dynamic missing due to Alex having her mind wiped to protect Kara. This leads to the other half of the relationship, Boss and subordinate, Supergirl and Director Danvers. Not the sister duo that kicked ass, had game nights, and fought over potstickers. Something does reverse the mind wipe, a blood memory, back when they were kids, Kara saved Alex's life. 

When Kara was getting beaten to death by red daughter, Alex's memories of Kara come back. She sees Kara laying on the ground bloody and runs to her. With her sister's love and help, Kara regains her strength through the solar energy in the plants. Other highlights include Nia's story, where she and Kara go visit the former's family. Nia has a dream of her mom dying and passes the dream powers over to Nia. Maeve Nal was angered by the fact that Nia became the Dreamer and not her. She's Nia as not being a real woman and that she should have gotten the powers. On the way out of town, Kara pulls the car over and comes out as Supergirl to Nia as a way of telling her she understands. 

The Children of Liberty storyline was well done, Manchester Black was a great villain, and Lex Luthor was the best villain of the season. Lex was as a great an antagonist for Kara as Manchester was for J'onn. J'onn has a story where he comes to terms with the fact that he is not a man of peace despite trying to uphold his people's traditions and make his dad proud. 5/5

Special Effects: Visually amazing. 5/5

Sound Effects: 5/5

Entertainment Value: Highly entertaining. 5/5

Replay Value: I would most certainly rewatch. 5/5

25/25: (Season Score)

35/35: (Overall Score)

Final Thoughts: Beautifully Done season, you had plenty of mini arcs in this, tied into a main storyline is that compelling. You have the Danvers sisters who are always fun to watch. One of my favorite scenes with them is after the mind wipe when Alex and Kara are talking about movies, specifically Terminator 2. Alex calls Kara a Goober and throws popcorn at her. Another favorite Danvers scene is when Alex's memories return, and she runs over to Kara and apologizes. Elseworld's part 3 is one of my favorite episodes in this season. J'onn fighting Manchester for the last time is awesome, and even him tracking him down is intense. Lex was a hell of a great villain in this season; Cryer plays an evil bastard well. Will Season 5 be just as good, or worse? We'll see. The Final Season review of Superman & Lois will drop Saturday.

Notes: Carl Lumbly, who first played Myrnn last season, was the voice of J;onn in the DCAU. The Quest for Peace is a reference to Superman IV, which had Jon Cryer as Lenny Luthor. Helen Slater, who had been playing Eliza Danvers since season 1, was Kara Zor-El/Supergirl in the 1984 movie of the same name. Red Daughter's disguise at the bar includes a nametag that say ""Linda Lee"", that's a reference to the '84 Supergirl's earth name.",3,1749060825.0,ArrowVDisscussions,2,1.0,False
