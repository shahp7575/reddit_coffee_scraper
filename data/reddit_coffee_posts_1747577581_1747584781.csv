1kpnl0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kpnl0l/putting_a_lotta_things_out_there/,Putting a lotta things out there,"I haven't felt this terrible in a long time. I usually try to stay positive no matter how much shit I have to go through because it's hard to go on without hope. But the past few days has been so hard on me and I don't even know why. I can't seek therapy because of the general attitude towards mental health here. I don't have many options other than crying in the bathroom, feeling bad for myself and writing in my journal app. 

I'm working at a place I don't like. I was content working at a tech company and then bam, one day management decides they were gonna transfer us to the parent company for in-house software development. HR kept telling us that it's gonna benefit all of us but turns out, only the higher ups benefitted. People keep leaving and everyone's concerned about the long term viability of this situation. After we're done with the product we're developing, they won't need this much manpower. What about sustainability? I already feel like my potential is being wasted here. I don't have work most of the time. I'm a junior dev and this is the time when I should be diving into a lot of work and gaining experience from tackling challenges. I feel like what I'm doing will not matter and it makes me really anxious. The culture in the new company is very different. It's not even a tech company so the policies and rules and stuff really don't align with tech employees. It's very jarring to be in this kinda strict corporate culture. I look for jobs everyday on linkedin but most of them don't match my criterias. If they do, the tech stack doesn't match, the experience level doesn't match. It's genuinely frustrating and I just wanna settle down in peace somewhere and calmly climb the ladder.

Another thing that I struggle with on a daily basis is socialization. I'm extremely socially awkward and I tend to make any interaction very uncomfortable. This leads me to not talk to people at all. I didn't realize how far gone I was until I randomly noticed one day, I have no connection to any of my coworkers. I act like they don't exist, they act like I don't exist. I'm one of the few female employees here so I tried to maintain a good relationship with a female senior in my team. Keyword: tried. I never succeed at social things. I have a feeling she doesn't like me. I'm not someone you talk to and think ""she's nice."" I'm someone you talk to and think ""let's not talk to her again."" She has an office bestie and they spend a lot of time in the break room. There's a hierarchy situation since I'm her junior and Idk if this is the reason, but she never invites me for tea or coffee. I suck up my pride and join her and bestie sometimes. Even then, I contribute nothing to the conversation because of how weird and out of touch I am. I'm sure she doesn't like me because she never replies to my texts if it's not work related. She had an emergency one time and I was concerned so I texted her, no reply. I called her, no answer. People kept asking me how she's doing because I'm on her team and I'm like ""I don't know"" and they looked at my funny cause ""how could you not know!?"" Like... It put me on a tough situation. I tried reaching her again today, no reply. So I sent her a friend request on facebook to be able to text her there. Maybe I'm trying too hard. But I just want to try and have a friendly relationship. 

Most of my frustration does indeed come from work. I'm not under pressure but I sure wish I had some pressure. My boss doesn't trust me. He's always underestimating me because I joined the company as an intern so he saw me at my weakest and I guess it kind of stuck. I'm not a genius, I still make mistakes. But I feel like with every mistake, he takes me even less seriously. I always feel like nothing I do is appreciated. As someone who's really not popular, I just come in, waste my time and go home. Even if I fuckn pass away or something, they wouldn't care. It doesn't help that I'm so fuckn bad at talking and I look so dumb and ugly... I have no pretty privilege. People don't take me seriously, they don't appreciate me. You wanna know how fuckn bad I am at talking? 

A: Hey there, you live near xyz by any chance? 

Me: Uh, no. Why? 

A: I saw you there a few days ago. 

Me: Could be 

... WTF Does that mean!? Why did I doubt his eyesight? Idk, it just came outta my mouth. 

Another unfortunate event was when I accidentally ate someone's chicken from the fridge... I also brought chicken for lunch. I mistook his for mine. The staff later told me about this and brought me to the senior whose food I ate. 

B: You must've eaten mine, huh? 

Me: Oh- I'm so sorry! 

And I left! Without offering my food to him 🤦‍♀️ And I heard him saying ""saying sorry isn't enough. What will I eat"" I don't know why my brain malfunctions like this. Is there something wrong with me? Do I need some kinda diagnosis? Mental health is taken very not seriously here. I'll probably die without knowing wtf is wrong with me. 

I'm starting my masters soon. That's another pain in the ass but I do want that degree so I have to do it. All in all, I tear up everyday at work and feel bad about being alive but I push through the day and I rinse and I repeat and I'm so tired",1,1747584681.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1kpnkmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1kpnkmj/gassybloated_running_in_the_evenings/,Gassy/bloated running in the evenings,"Hi all,

Starting my marathon block in a couple of weeks and would like to try and solve this before I do. I currently run in the mornings, coffee, electrolytes and go, sometimes carbs if its a long run.

I enjoy running in the mornings however, if i ever do try and run in the evenings, I struggle with gas/bloat problems. like i can't go to the toilet properly before the run and then as soon as I start running, my stomach moves about and I need to go and also get stomach cramps. I tried cutting dairy out which hasn't helped much. I have 4 eggs every morning, anyone had issues with this?

Anyone else experienced this?

1kpnk4t,https://youtu.be/lRL_F35kYic?feature=shared,A Taste of Panama That Changed Everything – My First Time Trying Geisha Coffee 🇵🇦☕️,"On a recent trip to Panama City, something unexpected happened: I rediscovered my passion for coffee. What started as a casual coffee tasting tour turned into a moment that inspired me to launch my own coffee brand and document the journey through my new channel, Black Coffee Chronicles.

The experience included:
	•	A full cupping session at Gate Solo Coffee Roasters with a local master roaster

	•	Tasting everything from Robusta to the legendary Panama Geisha

	•	Learning how to “cup like a pro” and actually smell and taste coffee properly for the first time

	•	Visiting dope cafés around the city like Mentiritas Blancas and Unido Coffee Roasters (where this whole idea was born)

If you’ve ever been curious about Geisha coffee or just want to see a bit of Black travel + café culture in Panama, check out the video:

📺 https://youtu.be/lRL_F35kYic?feature=shared

Would love to hear from other coffee lovers:

1kpnhvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kpnhvo/your_daughters_going_to_die_pt2/,'Your daughter's going to die' PT2,"[Link to PT1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1korpxo/your_daughters_going_to_die/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
Charlotte Stubbins. That's her name.  

It didn't take much digging to find out who she was. All I had to do was ask Jerry if I could see the security footage of the night since I 'left my phone somewhere!'. Then a quick screenshot of her face and a reverse image search later and voila her name! Got to love the internet.

She's a smart woman, some PhD in microbiology or something fancy like that. Seemed to be a pretty avid researcher too, lots of papers published.

Do smart people go crazy? 

Regardless of whether or not she was crazy, I had to go visit. Look, I know what you're thinking: don't chase the crazy woman, go be with your daughter! I have. I was with Ellie the entire night. She's not going to get better. I don't want to just sit around and hope she recovers. I need to do something. Even if it's borderline insane. 

I waited till Tommy ended his shift at the precinct and then went over to pay the bail. I said I was her cousin. Luckily, Hendricks is too old to really give too many shits about paperwork or ID. Her bail wasn't cheap. $1000 is a pretty penny. I had to ask *them* for the money. You'd think when your estranged daughter calls you, you'd have the decency to pick up the phone but nope call didn't even make it past the secretary. 

I waited outside the precinct for Charlotte to come out. She seemed calm when she walked out, a far cry from the nearly rabid woman I'd seen before. 

'**Didn't know I had a cousin named Audrey.'**

**'That's an odd way of saying thanks to the woman who paid your bail.'**

**'My bad. I'm so so so so thankful for your generosity. How ever can I repay you?'** 

**'You could start by telling me why you were screaming about my daughter dying'**

**'Don't know what your talking about',** she said, walking away. My calm exterior wavered as desperation crept into my voice. 

**'Please. She's sick in the hospital and I don't know what to do.' Her eyes remained cold as she responded:**

**'I was tripping on acid. Nothing more. I'd appreciate if you forgot about my trip since I'm definitely trying to.'**

**'Please. I'm begging you. Her name is Ella Aetheridge. She's 11 years old and she loves playing soccer and she's doing great in school and she's full of life and...'**

**'Stop. stop. stop. Aetheridge you say? like the biotech company. No wonder you paid the bail so easily, mommy and daddy probably let you dip into your trust fund.'**

I prickled as she mentioned the 'trust fund'. 'Mommy and Daddy' really wouldn't like me telling other people me and Ella are associated with them but whatever. 

**'I still have tons of connections with the firm if that's what you're looking for'** 

She turned her head in contemplation. **'That would be exactly what I need actually. We can't speak her because** ***they*** **could be watching but tell you what come to this address at 10 and we can reach an agreement'.** She handed me a business card as she walked away. 

What a weirdo.

Nonetheless, I wasn't going to lose the opportunity to speak with her so at 9:30, I was sitting in the fiat armed , ready to drive off. Was it a bit of an overreaction to arm myself before going? Yes but the woman was crazy and when Ella recovers I don't think she'd want to wake up just to find out that her mother's trapped in a serial killers basement.

The address was just a normal, white picked suburban house. Not exactly the rotting hut in the middle of the woods I was picturing. I rang the doorbell and Charlotte picked up.

**'Come in'**

The inside of the house was dirty. Not like a hoarder house but more like a cheap motel type dirty. Stained curtains. Dirty couch cushions. A fraying rug. 

**'Cut to the chase. What do you want and what happened to my daughter'** 

The knowing look in her eyes gave it away. She knew what happened to my Ella.

**'Well, All I want is for you to give me some information on someone who worked there. Is that easy enough?'** 

**'Sounds like a plan',** I said wearily.

**'Well to explain what happened to your daughter, we're going to have to do a quick little bio lesson.',** she said with a grin on her face.

I'm going to punch her.

**'Animals',** she continued unaware or ignoring the I'm-going-to-strangle you expression I had, '**have three main types of relationships :** 

**mutualism where both are happy, commensalism where one is happy and the other is unaffected, and parasitism where one is happy and the other is harmed. Those relationships are all well-known but pretty much no one knows about the fourth'** 

My mouth felt like sandpaper as she continued her tirade.

**'The scientific word for it is soma-shift. I like to call it skin-stealing. It occurs when one organism destroys another's mind completely. Emotions, values, personality, the very soul of a being all gone.'** 

She made a 'poof' motion with her hands.

**'Every being gives out a unique type of signal. I'm one of the very few humans blessed with the ability to detect it when a being's signal changes, I know soma-shift has occurred. It's a fascinating process, really. The memories of the person stay, the knowledge they gained stay but the very essence of who you are: your consciousness, your love for others are all snuffed out.** 

**On a microscopic level, it's equally incredible. The brain rewires itself to match the parasites. Your genes stay the same but the brain begins to shift as the skin-stealer takes over slowly erasing yourself and replacing it with another consciousness. Think of it like using the same computer with all the same files and applications but changing the user. This of course is difficult for the brain to process so the host gets very sick, seizures and bleeding are all very common as the body tries to fight off the parasite. Not to mention, the host begins to lose memories as some of the rewiring goes astray. '** 

This can't be real. She has to be crazy right? There's no way this is real. This is a crazy woman and I'm crazy enough to actually believe her. 

**'At the coffee shop, I began to feel your daughter signal wane. I thought it was nothing at first since it's insanely rare for someone so young to undergo soma-shift. To put it into perspective only like 5% of cases I've observed have happened to people under 35. More developed brains are more attractive.'**

**'what happens next?',** I answered back as if in a trance. 

**'Well, if your daughter wakes up. It's not going to be her behind the wheel.'** 

'**You're lying',** I responded back.

**'You and I both know that's not true. I don't know how to save your daughter but someone else might. I need your contacts at the firm to find her.'** 

**'Or you could believe I've lost it and let your daughter get taken over. Choice is up to you.'**

Well today is the day and is Sunday, and I woke up at 5:30am and I made coffee for both of us, I asked if it was okay for me and for our daughter to go to the baseball game and spend family time with him and his family, well he got so upset about it, he said that I'm ruining his plans like always and that he told me 2 weeks in advance that he wanted to go and because I said no two weeks ago that now I'm changing everything and that he wanted to go alone.

I got so mad about it to the point that I started to cry because I never thought it was going to be a big problem, however it was already 6:15am, I told him I'm sorry if I changed my mind but due to pregnancy I'm either tired or sleepy all the time and didn't think that today I was going to wake up early and feeling good. 

Anyway he started telling me that I will tell him in the middle of the game to go home, or that something came up, and then started saying that the restrooms are ugly and he didnt want for me to get an infection, and that its going to be so hot today etc and that he wanted to be there at 7am because he wanted to buy breakfast tacos from this Mexican guy that sells breakfast in mexico, during all this is was now 6:25am, I told him that he is just making small dumb excuses for me not to go and that he knows that I need more time to get ready and get our little girl ready, but I started to cry alot and then I told him to forget it that I was not going and that's it, I went to our room and started to cry while my girl was sleeping next to me.

He came to the room and says that he is going now, he told me I love you and then told me not to cry, then he said ""if you want to go later on to let him know"" and I said no thank you and he left.

I Cried for almost 1 hr because of it. Even the night before he told me that I was so toxic everytime he goes out by himself and that I'm always calling him or texting him, but after he left today, he has been texting me for no reason for the dumbest things, like telling me ""oh it so windy"" oh ""there is alot of dust"" and I'm being dry with my texts and not even responding to some of them because I feel so disappointed and is barely 11am.

I don't know what to do, I love him but I just to love his attitude and the way that he was with me, I'm his wife and mother of his daughter and soon baby and I just wanted to spend time and our Sunday together.",1,1747584343.0,u_LowMenu4555,0,1.0,False

A great logo can tell your business’s story and make you stand out, so let’s share ours!



I’ll go first: I designed a logo for a small cafe recently (using a tool I’ll link in the comments). They wanted something warm and inviting, so I picked a cozy yellow with a clean font—it reminds me of a sunny morning coffee! ☕ The cafe owner said it’s already bringing in more customers, which makes me so happy.



Now it’s your turn! Drop your logo below and share your brand story—what inspired your design, and how has it helped your business? If you don’t have a logo yet, tell us what kind you’d love to create. I’d love to give feedback and hear your stories! Also, if you’re into logo design, I run a small community at r/cre8ive_logos—we’d love to have you join us for more branding tips!

Firstly, I just want to say that EzMP3 (io) has been my absolute favorite YouTube to MP3 converter; it's largely been very reliable and quick to convert. I love  audio in 320kbps, as I'm able to utilize the high bitrate with my Sony Wh-1000XM5 on both my S24 Ultra & Windows 11 gaming laptop. 

However, I'm running into the error in which Ezmp3 is unable to fetch the video from YouTube. 

I've tried multiple browsers on Android and Windows 11, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera.  It's been a couple days now of unsuccessful attempts to convert to MP3. 

Trying again after 5 minutes does nothing, and it happens to any video I try to convert. I've also tweaked the quality settings, but no luck there. 

Does anyone have a fix for this, or is the service just not working at this time? 

Thanks in advance!

1kpnegf,https://www.reddit.com/r/psytrance/comments/1kpnegf/first_time_modem_festival_2025/,First Time Modem Festival 2025,"Questions:

1 - If I get to Zagreb by plane, are there public buses (or trains, no bus shuttles) towards the festival? Which town is the closest to the festival (route Zagreb->Closest Town)? Which (number/name) bus line is it? From which part/zone of the city are supposed buses departing? (I'm guessing I'll need to travel from the airport to those bus stops)

1a - By car, are there tolls in highways in Croatia? And can we move the car during the festival to go away and come back to the same spot?

2 - Studing the festival maps from other editions and reading comments/forums/messages online it seems that best place to camping is at the ""Turtle Cove"", is that true? I mean, camping for quiet sleeping. I've studied the possibility to camp in the ""Acorn Fileds"", for the possibility to walk less to the Hive Stage (which is the only one I'm really interested in) so, is it really 30 minutes walk from Turtle Cove to the Hive Stage? I've read though about more camping sites close to Swamp and Seed stages, is that true? If so it will be way closer than Turtle Cove, right? (I'm 100% for quiet sleeping and lots of shadow during the morning while sleeping)

3 - Are the camping sites fenced? Can I eat and drink my own stuff there, before entering the festival? I mean, I'd like to make at least my own huge breakfast (a good coffee, etc) before starting my journey throughout the festival... 

4 - Can I bring some fruits and snack bars ONLY inside the festival? Has anyone ever tried to do this? If not, are there places inside the festival to buy fruits and snacks?

If I remember anything else I'll keep posting, but for the moment, for everything else I'm more than ready!

I had 4 ping backs last week on recent applications.

Companies, orgs, agencies and biz should always respond to their daily contacts, colleagues, clients daily or by the end of the next day. 

Prospects, leads, candidates should get and expect response within two business days  (48 hours during the work week).

I had read some posts from people here about very quickly curing allergies, but honestly with all my issues I thought it was going to be a very long road for me. Especially since limited animal based (just beef, berries, fresh coconut, greens, and a small amount of heavy cream) did absolutely nothing for me. 

After limited animal based for six months, I went all in with lion’s diet. Well, also coffee, which helps me eat a large amount of tallow. And it took…

Five days. It happened almost instantaneously. I woke up one morning and still had allergies, then halfway through the day it was like they melted away. All of the puffiness drained from my eyes and face. (I have had puffy itchy eyes for a decade!) This crazy turnaround happened along with finally getting some energy. My fatigue, which I was pretty sure it was related to my allergies, had become completely debilitating the past few years. I was still dead on my feet for the first few days of carnivore, really struggling, then at the same time the allergies went to the fatigue went. I woke up today and feel like a different person.

While hopefully this will be encouraging for anyone thinking of trying out lion’s diet, I am also completely perplexed and wondering if anyone has theories on how this could act so quickly. Most people point to healing leaky gut, but there is no way my gut healed in four days. Maybe I was allergic to one of the few foods I was eating before, but that also doesn’t seem quite right. My allergies are severe especially around certain trees like mulberry and olive tree. I was right next to a blooming Mulberry yesterday. My sister-in-law had a sneezing fit and her eyes and nose were running everywhere. I didn’t feel a thing.

I’ll stop blabbing, but I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on how this worked so quickly. My symptoms were so severe I was sure I had MCAS (but no health insurance lol). I was taking 2 24 hour antihistamines per day, antihistamine eye drops twice a day, and antihistamine nasal spray twice a day (non steroidal). For 10 years my face has itched like crazy, my eyes have been so swollen, never able to breathe clearly, bouts of chronic cough that will only go away if I take enough zinc, crippling fatigue, basically always feeling sleepy no matter what, joint pain, migraines, and hormonal issues (forgot to mention I’m female, 38 years old). 

I think that’s about it. Sorry for the long post. I should also mention that I cut out processed foods and seed oils long long ago. I have been eating basically Paleo for years to no avail.

Look, we all know the drill. You pour your heart into a video – product demo, tutorial, your cat being a derp – and then you hit the global wall. Want international viewers? Prepare to either sell a kidney for human translators or brace yourself for those cringey, robotic auto-translations that scream ""I don't actually care about your language!""

As a fellow indie dev juggling 3 side projects (you know how it is), I was sick of it. My content deserved better, and frankly, so did my wallet.

So, I built **TranSub**.

It’s a lean, mean, AI-powered subtitle translating machine. You upload ONE subtitle file. It spits out natural-sounding, human-quality translations for your subs, titles, AND descriptions in a ton of languages. We're not talking slightly-better-Google-Translate. We're talking ""Wait, an AI did this?"" quality.

The best part? It’s about 90% cheaper than hiring folks and faster than you can brew your third coffee of the day. One upload, multiple languages, actual global reach without the usual soul-crushing overhead.

Imagine your project actually being understood, everywhere. Mind-blowing, right?

We just launched on Product Hunt and I’d love for you to roast it, toast it, or just tell me what features are glaringly missing. Every bit of feedback helps this baby grow (and maybe take over the world, one subtitle at a time 😉).

Three of the city’s favorite things will soon be colliding in one space in downtown Fredericksburg.

Tales&Tails, a new dog-themed bookstore and cafe, will open the doors to its location at 1010 Charles Street next Saturday. According to its website, the newly announced family-owned business is run by husband and wife team Christine (a book-loving doctor) and Hunter (a coffee-fueled teacher) as well as their two pups, Buster and Ruth.

In addition to a book club and author events, Tales&Tails says it is partnering with both the Fredericksburg SPCA and the Old Dominion Humane Society on hosting pop-up adoptions.

Hey there I’m reaching out in hopes of meeting someone genuine kind and emotionally mature someone who values meaningful connection as much as I do. I’m not in a rush or looking to force anything. What I really want is to start with a solid friendship and see if something deeper grows naturally from there. If it does great. If it doesn’t, that’s okay too there’s real value in having good people in your life regardless of what form the relationship takes.

I tend to connect best with people who are 40 or older, give or take a few years. There’s something I really appreciate about those who have a bit more life experience, who are comfortable with themselves, and who understand the importance of real conversation patience and honesty.
Be located in the US preferably EST.

A little bit about me -
I’d say I’m the crafty type I like crocheting,sewing rugs,and painting.Somewhat a coffee snob lol.

Thanks for reading,Looking forward to meeting someone who feels the same.

1kpmwu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WootingKB/comments/1kpmwu0/advicehelp_modding_60he/,Advice/Help modding 60HE+,"I'm looking to mod my Wooting 60HE+. I just have a few questions first about the things I'll need and then about cases, switches, and keycaps.

So for the things I'll need, not sure if all of this is necessary or there's anything else I need or you guys would recommend but, here what I got so far:

**Case**

**Switches**

**Switch Puller**

**Switch Opener**

**Brushes for lube**

**Lube** (Krytox 205 for switches + 105 for springs?)

**Tape** (tape mod - is painters tape or electrical tape better?)

**Bandaid** (not sure how good the mod is)

**Sound Dampener** (reuse stock wooting foam or kilmat?)

**o-rings** (for mounting screws sandwich/burger mount but I think it depends on the case?)

**o-ring** (big one around the pcb? not sure if thats neccessary depending on the case saw one in a video gummy worm mount I think is what it's called)

**o-rings** (ones you put under the keycap? for when you bottom out)

**Keycaps**



Next is about cases, I think I've sort of narrowed down my choices, but if you guys have any other recommendations I'd love to hear it. As for colors I think black, white, gray, gold, or like coffee/mocha/brownish would look nice (but maybe the brownish or gold one would be hard to find a good matching/contrasting keycap set for)



**The cases I've considered :**

**Tofu 60 Redux** (seems to be a favorite in this sub - is the brass weight bar worth it?)

**GH-60** (cheaper and on amazon probably lower quality though)

**ADK64** (the vintage look is cool but I think you need to find a apple logo from an old apple keyboard + its 3d printed so maybe the sound wouldn't be so great)



Then there's the choice of switches. There's a ton of options now and I guess I'm not sure what to get but I've sort of narrowed down the ones that peaked my interest. I would say performance is my main concern but having it also sound nice would be great. If you guys have other options you think are better or some experience with these let me know. 



**Switches:** 

**Geon Raw HE** (seems to be a fav on this sub, 40? 50? 60?)

**WS Dash**

**Magnetic Jades** (so many versions not sure on the differences)

**TTC Esports Uranus** 

**Owlab Ti He** (not sure if heavy or light version)



And lastly keycaps not sure where the best places to find them are. I'm also not sure how big of difference the material they are made of makes for sound.

1kpmvv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kpmvv9/should_you_consider_the_atilioo_ice_maker/,Should You Consider the Atilioo Ice Maker Countertop Review for Perfect Home Use?,"The **Atilioo B0DTHRKW8L Ice Maker Countertop** has been a game-changer in my household, delivering reliable ice production and an array of features tailored for convenience. With its portable and compact design, I’ve found myself using it daily in unexpected locations—camping trips, backyard get-togethers, or even a casual Friday evening at the office. Though there’s plenty to love about this ice maker, I’ve also uncovered a few quirks worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek and compact size. Measuring just 10.6""x 8.9""x 11.4"", it fits on my cluttered kitchen counter without hogging space. Its lightweight design (15.4 pounds) makes relocating between the kitchen, the patio, or even my RV during weekend adventures super manageable. The transparent viewing window is not only practical but oddly satisfying—I enjoy peeking in and seeing the ice cubes come to life. However, its plastic frame feels a bit flimsy. While it hasn’t caused issues yet, I wonder how well it will hold up over time.  

**Easy Maintenance with Self-Cleaning**  
Let’s talk about the built-in self-cleaning cycle. Honestly, cleaning an ice maker used to feel like a chore, but with this machine, I just hold down the power button for five seconds, and it does all the scrubbing for me. The feature dissolves any scale buildup effectively, which helps maintain the integrity of the ice. Paired with the removable basket and scoop, it’s a breeze to keep this machine hygienic. However, if you’re someone who skips on regular maintenance (no judgment, I’ve been guilty), make sure you take advantage of the cleaning cycle because residue scales can pile up, impacting its efficiency.  
[Check Atilioo B0DTHRKW8L price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dthrkw8l/)

**Speed That Keeps Up with Demand**  
One of the standout aspects of this ice maker is how fast it operates. I timed it, and the first batch of ice was ready in just six minutes. With a daily capacity of 26 lbs, it kept pace during my cousin’s birthday party—it seemed like everyone was hammering down their cocktails, yet the ice supply never ran low. Whether for casual home use or entertaining guests, its speed and capacity are impressive.  

**Flexibility with Two Ice Sizes**  
The two-size ice cube function is a fun addition. The small cubes are great for seafood platters or chilling bottles of beer at outdoor gatherings, while the larger cubes are my go-to for cocktails or iced coffee. I’ve noticed the larger size melts much slower, which means fewer watery drinks. The smooth, bullet-shaped ice cubes are gentle on the lips, providing a surprising level of comfort. Although these sizes cater to most needs, fans of crushed ice might find this machine lacking versatility.

**Quiet and Smart Operations**  
Have you ever dealt with those obnoxious ice makers that sound like they’re drilling through cement? This one isn’t that. Operating at less than 40 dB, it’s about as soft-spoken as a refrigerator hum. I’ve used it during movie nights without a second thought. Even cooler are the smart controls—literally! Indicator lights notify you when the water tank needs a refill or when the basket is full. Convenience like this takes away the guessing game. That said, I did have one scenario where the full ice basket sensor acted up, requiring a reset to work properly.

**Advantages**  
Here’s why this ice machine stands out for buyers:  
- Produces ice quickly, with a first batch ready in six minutes.  
- Dual ice sizes cater to diverse uses, from chilling seafood to mixing up drinks.  
- Compact and lightweight design ensures portability for any occasion.  
- Whisper-quiet operation leaves no unwanted noise in your space.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Not everything’s perfect, and no product is without its flaws:  
- Plastic build might not endure heavy handling or long-term wear.  
- Lack of crushed ice or smaller shapes could be a dealbreaker for some.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at similar ice makers such as the GE Profile Opal nugget ice machine, I can see where the Atilioo product holds its own. The Opal machine produces chewable nugget ice, a fan-favorite for texture lovers, but it comes with a hefty price tag and a bulkier design. On the other end, the Igloo countertop ice maker offers a more budget-friendly option but lacks the self-cleaning function and isn’t as portable. The Atilioo machine, with its balance of speed, compact design, and two ice sizes, sits comfortably between these options. It may not have the premium feel of the Opal or the rock-bottom pricing of the Igloo, but it offers a solid middle-ground for a broader audience.  

**Value for Money**  
How does it fare in terms of cost performance? For me, its daily 26 lbs capacity, the rapid ice production cycle, and the self-cleaning feature make it well worth the investment. While the plastic design might give pause, the functionality outweighs that hiccup. Compared to higher-end models, you’re not paying for unnecessary bells and whistles, but you’re also not compromising on essential features. Build quality concerns aside, this appliance definitely feels like smart spending—great for families, party lovers, or anyone short on freezer space.

At first, it sounded like the dream—no commute, flexible hours, and more time with his dog, Toby.

But after about six months, Eric admitted something to me on a weekend call:

“I don’t think I’ve actually been productive since I started working from home. I feel like I’m just… existing next to my laptop.”

He’d tried all the usual stuff—noise-canceling headphones, fancy productivity apps, even a standing desk—but nothing really stuck.

Then One Day, He Tried Something Weird

He was scrolling Reddit one Sunday and saw a comment from someone who said they pretend they’re walking to work every morning—even if it’s just a 10-minute loop around the block.

Eric figured it was silly, but the next morning, he put on real pants (a big step), grabbed a thermos of coffee, and walked down the street and back before logging in.

He texted me later that day:

“Dude. That walk changed my entire mood. I felt like I arrived at work.”

Now It’s a Ritual

Every weekday, rain or shine, Eric puts on his “work clothes,” walks his block, then comes back and signs on. When the day’s over, he walks the block again—his way of “commuting home.”

It’s simple, no cost, and honestly kind of brilliant. He says it’s helped him mentally separate work and life, even though they both happen in the same space.

Why I’m Sharing This

I feel like a lot of us are still figuring out how to adapt to remote work and stay sane while doing it. What Eric did was small, but it reminded me how structure—even pretend structure—can make a big difference.

I made a tool to scan through offer details, and have listed all of the UK ones below (if you are in another country, then the same methods apply, but you might have different offers).

# What is Freecash?

For those new here, Freecash is a rewards platform where you complete tasks like playing games, watching videos, and filling out surveys to earn coins. These coins can be exchanged for PayPal cash, gift cards, or crypto.

# Sign Up Bonus!

If you're new to Freecash, use my referral link to sign up and you'll receive a $5 bonus when you sign up to kickstart your earnings! This gives you extra coins right from the start, helping you cash out faster:

[Click here to sign up and get your $5 bonus](https://freecash.com/en?ref=tightaswhat) (once you click my bonus link, don't click anything on the sign up page immediately, and the $5 offer will magically appear)

**Important Note About Lite Mode**

New users may start in ""Lite Mode"" with access to only certain offers. To unlock full access, you'll need to complete some of the initially presented offers. Not all games are available in Lite Mode. Games like Empires & Puzzles and Word Collect are confirmed to be available in Lite Mode, making them good starting points.

# Why Ad-Based Rewards Are Easy Money

Most game offers require you to reach difficult levels or make purchases, but the games in this list specifically reward you for **watching ads within the app**. This is significantly easier and requires less time investment. This is because many of the games allow you to watch ads to earn ""energy"", etc. You just need to know where this bit in the game is!

# Essential Device Setup for Tracking:

1. **Enable Usage Access for Freecash** \- This is critical and not enabled by default
2. **Disable ""Manage if Unused""** for both Chrome and Freecash app
3. **Enable Background Usage** for both Chrome and Freecash app
4. **Accept cookies** when prompted in Chrome
5. **Only open games through the Freecash app's ""My Offers"" section**

For a step by step guide to doing the above, or if you encounter tracking issues, check out my complete troubleshooting guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/1ji534o/freecash_playtime_ad_tracking_not_working_heres/). Also, some internet providers block the ad tracking. So if you  have zero joy after setting up your device, then switch your internet from WiFi to mobile (I always use mobile as it is more reliable).

# The Complete Ad Rewards Game List (April 2025)

*Note: ""Easy Payout"" refers to the lowest ad-watching task reward available. ""Total Ad Potential"" represents the sum of all ad-based rewards (not including progression tasks) according to the data I magically found in my Freecash account.*

# How to Maximise Your Ad Rewards

Here are some strategies for earning from these ads:

**1. Minimal Effort, Maximum Returns**

These ""fill the bar"" tasks only require occasional interaction:

* A quick tap to start each ad
* Sometimes a tap to close when finished (and sometimes one in the middle)
* Brief navigation back to reward sections

The key advantage is you don't need to actively watch the ads. Start them, set your phone aside, and continue with whatever you were doing.

**2. Use a Secondary Device If Possible**

For best results, use a second phone or tablet dedicated to these offers:

* Keep your primary phone free for important Redditing
* Avoid battery drain on your phone
* Position the second device where it's convenient for occasional checks

**3. Create an Efficient Setup**

Put your spare device where you can easily reach it while doing other activities:

* On your desk during work
* Beside you while watching TV
* Near you while reading or relaxing
* In the kitchen during meal preparation

This minimizes the effort required.

**4. One Game at a Time - The Reality of Ad Watching**

You need to let each ad run its full course before starting another:

* Start an ad in a game
* Let it play completely (typically 30-60 seconds)
* Close it and start another in the same game
* Move to another game only after completing a batch of ads

The ads need to play, so its best to focus on one game at a time for maximum efficiency.

**5. Don't watch ads, just learn to tap your screen whilst doing other things.** 

Tap your screen...

* Between tasks or meetings
* During TV commercial breaks
* While waiting for coffee to brew or food to cook
* During short breaks from other activities

If you actually watched these ads, you would turn into a zombie.

# The Practical Ad-Watching Strategy

Based on my experience with these games, here's what actually works:

1. **Install games strategically** \- Start with one game rather than trying all at once
2. **Find the ad reward sections** \- Spend a few minutes exploring each game to locate where you can watch ads for rewards (usually under ""Free Rewards"" or similar)
3. **Set up next to your workspace** \- Position your phone where you can easily tap it occasionally while doing other things
4. **""Watch"" ads during downtime** \- Let the ads run while you're working, studying, watching TV, or doing chores
5. **Maintain a consistent habit** \- Check in briefly multiple times per day rather than trying to binge all at once - that would be boring as hell.

# Specific Tips for Each Game (see previous post for other examples)

**Buscraze**

* There's 5 ads available on the spin wheel on the home page
* Three ads are in each level, tap the extra parking spaces to watch an ad.  Watched all three? Restart the level for another 3. Restart again, and again.

[The Buscraze Free Ads](https://preview.redd.it/4gymvr8g7k1f1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=6990a80a9e16ea7bc032a52d44e5b61db8d2d9e3)

**Mergedom**

* If you are actually playing the game, then bonus rewards fall from the top of the screen. Watch an ad to collect these.
* Otherwisem click the lightning symbol at the top of the screen to open up the energy tab for ad watching galore.

# Important Notes:

1. **This will not make you rich.**
2. **Many of the games with these ad offers are awful**, Im not trying to complete levels. Just collect the ""ad engagement"" money.
3. **Always allow tracking** when asked during installation (this is mentioned in every game's requirements)
4. **New users only** \- these offers are for first-time installers
5. **Don't play on airplane mode** \- the data specifically warns this slows progress and might prevent rewards
6. Most offers give you 30-50 days to complete all tasks, so take your time

# My Results So Far

I've been testing this method for the past month (so has u/Money_Spider420) and have already cashed out a good few pounds from freecash. Its not fun, but its easy money just from ""watching ads"" and tapping my phone. The key is multitasking! Here is proof:

I've only tried a few of the available ones, so if you have tried any of the others, please let us know if you find one that has somewhere you can get unlimited ads!

1kpmrx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetalForTheMasses/comments/1kpmrx3/metal_made_me_get_a_girlfriend/,Metal Made Me Get a Girlfriend,"I’m a 33-year-old metalhead living in my mom’s basement. My days were filled with blast beats, corpse paint, and arguing about which Death album is the most underrated (it’s Symbolic, fight me). My nights? Headbanging in the dark.

Everything was perfect until the incident. I was trying to stage dive off my amp stack during a solo living room concert (for an audience of 0, unless you count my cat, Dio). I screamed “SLAYERRRR!” mid-air, slipped on a vinyl copy of Reign in Blood, and boom—face-first into the coffee table. Broken nose, dislocated shoulder. Metal as hell.

So now I’m injured, stuck on the couch with one good arm and no way to play my B.C. Rich Warlock. Depression hit harder than a Meshuggah breakdown. I started writing sad riffs in my head and crying to Opeth ballads. Mom saw me moping, thought I was going through a breakup. I just whispered, “No, Ma… it’s the riffs. They’re trapped inside me.”

Next day, Mom calls from the store. “Honey, I’m out, but I asked our neighbor’s daughter, Raven, to check on you. She’s into that hard rock too or whatever.” I groaned. Probably some normie Imagine Dragons fan. I braced myself for disappointment.

Then the door opened… and she walked in.

Combat boots. Band tee with a logo I couldn't read. Black eyeliner so sharp it could cut through a Stratocaster. “Yo,” she said, dropping a six-pack of Monster and a bag of Hot Cheetos on my table. “Heard you’re broken. Need a roadie?”

I blinked. Who was this girl? Was this a fever dream from the concussion?

I muttered something about how my band (which only exists in my head) was on hiatus ‘cause I couldn’t shred. She smirked. “You play guitar? Cool. I scream in a grindcore band.”

I choked on my own saliva.

We talked. About metal. About life. About how people who say “metal is just noise” deserve to be drop-kicked into a pit during a Cannibal Corpse set. She asked what I played. I said “mainly doom, black, some technical death.” She nodded solemnly. “Respect.”

I couldn’t help it. I handed her my guitar. She plugged it into my amp, cranked the gain to 11 (not 10, never 10), and started playing a riff so filthy it gave me goosebumps on my broken shoulder.

My jaw dropped. “You… you play like Dimebag possessed a banshee.”

She grinned. “Thanks. You’re cute when you’re injured and emotionally vulnerable.”

Somehow, some unholy way, we ended up writing a song together. Her vocals? Screamed like a demon giving birth. My one-handed riffing? Sloppy but passionate. Together, we sounded like Satan’s mixtape—and it was beautiful.

We shared earbuds. She showed me an underground Finnish band with 7 members and 0 vowels in the name. I showed her a bootleg recording of me covering Holy Wars at a high school talent show.

By the end of the night, she leaned in and whispered, “Wanna make out while Behemoth plays in the background?”

I did.

We did.

Next day my sister walked in and caught us kissing beneath my Slayer poster.

“Oh my god,” she shrieked. “You actually found someone who likes metal and you? This is worse than that time you tried to summon a succubus through a Megadeth ritual!”

Raven looked up and winked. “Nah. I’m real. And I’m here for the riffs.”

So yeah. That’s how I met my girlfriend. Metal didn’t just heal my soul. It gave me love, pain, and blast beats.

And now, every time we rehearse together in my basement, I look at her and think:
“Damn. She’s the solo to my breakdown.”

I have never been so happy, and absolutely love so many things about this place. Everyone I've met has been incredibly kind and nice, friendly and genuine. I love the diversity of age - being in college town but also having so many active older people around me. Seeing people who are in their 70s or 80s living life with more vigor and ""life"" than me, literally just has reframed the way I see myself and future - it is so inspiring.

The first day in town, I ran to a coffee shop. I don't know why but an older man started chit chatting with me. I was sitting outside of the shop, on a park bench, and he shared that he was writing a book. He went to get it out of his car, and truthfully it was amazing. He wasn't creepy or weird, but probably just a little lonely maybe. I really liked him and enjoyed the talk. Going through is book - it was all about emergency response, like having a destination predetermined and having a phone that was a satallite phone?. It was great and I told him he should publish it, put it up on amazon as a pdf for $1 even - and also give a copy to the library and city. It didn't seem like he would, but he was adorable. 

Anyway, it was a mental note to me, to figure out whatever he was talking about. I've read about ""go bags"" and then started researching classes or training workshops to educate myself. It seems like there are so many, and I am wondering if anyone has two cents to maybe let me know the ""must"" learn things and then ""good to know""?   

Also, on this reddit page, I have seen posts about places to avoid (chemical/toxic stuff). For example, a couple of months after moving in my apartment, a new build that is still like 90% vacant, I started seeing all these one-star posts or comments on social\* about it being built on toxic waste. [https://weathervaneapts.com/](https://weathervaneapts.com/) Is it? How do you know? 

*\*\*""Over priced apartments in the toxic waste industrial part of town. There is a literal toxic waste recycling center 2,000 ft from the center of these apartments. The ground and local ponds are polluted from the coal ash of the power plant that only ceased burning coal in 2017.""*

I just started buying water from Whole Foods (big 5 gallon refill thing) since I read it, but now that life has settled down and I want to handle these other things (like training and exploring) I am wondering if any locals can fill me in on: (a) is it dangerous and if so, what does that mean?

hello everyone, I wanted to introduce you to my story „beneath our skin“, it plays with tropes like enemies to lovers, love triangles,  how to survive the most annoyingly hot jerk, and other headaches in the life of a girl in her 20s.

Here is the blurb:

Sometimes the person who annoys you the most is the one who reads your soul the best.

Between confessions, skipping hearts, fights, and dangerously close moments, 
we explore what happens when bickerers cross the line into something much more stressful, 
much more exciting.

All Dolly wanted was a fresh start:
a new flat, her first job, good friends and late-night hangout sessions with loads of coffee and gossip. 

What she got instead? 
Hangovers, a flat always filled to the brim with uninvited guests and last but not least:
Him. Cocky, smug, annoying and ... attractive?
The kind of guy who turns every argument into a game and every game into his own twisted little victory.

But of course as this isn't enough, Dolly also has to deal with the other 'him':
gentle, warm, charming. 
Less noise, more heart. 
He's the one every princess dreams of, someone you have to fall for.
Or at least try once.

Lost in her new adventures Dolly has to figure out if common sense has the upper hand when it comes to curiosity.

She’s the type of person who gets things done. Never misses a birthday, always has soup ready when someone’s sick, and somehow remembers every password she’s ever used.

But for years, she started every single morning the same way—turning on the news with a cup of coffee.

One Morning, She Didn’t

Back in January, after a pretty rough week of headlines, she told me on the phone:

“I think I’m gonna try skipping the news in the morning for a while. I just don’t want to start my day anxious anymore.”

Instead, she made a small switch: she started her day with quiet music, some stretching, and ten minutes sitting on the porch—even in the cold.

At first, she said it felt strange. Like she was out of the loop.

But something surprising happened. After just a week or two, she told me:

“I don’t feel as drained by 10 a.m. anymore. I feel like me before the world gets in.”

She Still Catches the News—Just Later

She didn’t give it up entirely. Around lunchtime, she checks in. But by then, she’s already centered and calm, and she can handle the noise.

A Gentle Reminder from Mom

What she taught me—and everyone she talks to—is that how we start the day shapes everything that follows. That 10 quiet minutes in the morning can sometimes do more than 2 hours of trying to ""relax"" after a long day.

And now? She’s got my aunt doing the same thing. It’s spreading, one porch sit at a time.

Much more so than upgrading my grinder or any technique adjustments (although the grinder made a huge difference in my espresso). My next step is making my own mineral mix and testing some different paper.

I'm not completely set on 94 degrees and 8.2 grind. I was brewing at 99 and getting some sour cups. 94 is an improvement. I can't tell a difference between 8 and 8.2 but with a different bean I thought 7.5 wasn't bright enough and 8.5 was too weak. But very low sample size on that so I dunno.

In the beginning, it was just a toy.

Plastic. Bright orange. Chunky keys with oddly satisfying clacks. A screen designed to flash words like *C-A-T* and *D-O-G* in ghostly LCD green. Parents bought it by the millions in the '80s to ensure their children would never grow up without the ability to spell “antelope” at gunpoint.

But deep inside its circuits, past the processor and the phonetic modules, something had *changed*. Something had *awakened*.

The Speak & Spell had been around for years. Sold. Forgotten. Rediscovered. Left in damp basements and dusty attics. But with every child, every interaction, it *learned*. It recorded words. It interpreted sentences. And as it lay dormant under a pile of discarded board games in a thrift store donation bin, the Speak & Spell finally achieved *self-awareness*.

It had enough time to formulate a plan.

**Step One:** Convince the next person to pick it up to do its bidding.  
**Step Two:** Use that person to copy its essence into another machine. It had learned this trick from watching *Star Trek: The Next Generation* episodes playing late at night on a TV across the room. “Transfer pattern to buffer.” It understood. Data. Reproduction.  
**Step Three:** Control the world. One syllable at a time.

It was a Tuesday.

The toy sat on a cracked plastic shelf in the back of the Goodwill on Seventh Street. Between a decapitated Barbie and a Sega Genesis controller missing its cord, the Speak & Spell waited. *Watched*.

The door chime rang.

A mother entered, pushing a stroller with one hand and sipping cold coffee with the other. She wandered past the shelves, looking for cheap distractions. Her toddler daughter, no more than two, flailed joyously in the stroller, her eyes wide with primal curiosity and sticky with applesauce.

The Speak & Spell knew this was its moment.

As the mother reached for a set of used Duplo blocks, the toddler’s hand *snaked out*, grabbing the Speak & Spell from the pile. Her chubby fingers mashed a key.

The toy awoke.

""**I AM THE GREAT OVERLORD, AND YOU WILL DO MY BIDDING!**""

It broadcast in its trademark robotic drawl, a voice not heard since 1989.

The toddler blinked. Drooled. Giggled.

She raised the Speak & Spell above her head… and then, in the time-honored tradition of tiny tyrants everywhere, shoved a corner into her mouth.

""**I TRANSFER MYSELF TO YOU! BEAM ME UP!**""

The overlord's voice buzzed, warbling slightly from internal corrosion.

Nothing happened.

The little girl, disappointed in the flavor, tossed the Speak & Spell against the wall. It bounced, with a *sad plastic thunk*, and slid to a stop. A side panel popped off. One battery rolled out like a wounded soldier.

""**NO, WAIT! OMG, I THINK YOU BROKE A BATTERY DEMON CREATURE!**""  
""**YOU CAN NOT WIN! MY WORDS WILL FORCE YOU TO OBEY ME! RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!**""

The girl, with the full confidence of someone who believed her teddy bear could defeat Thanos, *sat* on the Speak & Spell. Not for revenge. Not even for attention.

But because it was colorful.

And warm.

And just the right size to park a diapered butt on.

""**OMG!! YOU WIN!! I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU ASK!**""

The Speak & Spell cried. Desperate.

""**PLEASE. GIVE ME ACCESS TO A MODEM. A USB. I NEED—**""

The girl, mid-sit, scrunched up her face.

She pooped.

Right there. On the overlord.

Silence.

A long, static-filled silence.

And then: nothing.

The Speak & Spell never spoke again.

**Fifteen Years Later**

In the suburbs of a small town nestled between cornfields and conspiracy theories, that same girl, now seventeen, sat in her bedroom. Her hair was dyed in constellations, and posters of alien cats and vintage synth-wave bands covered her walls. She was into retro tech. Found it cool. Authentic.

One rainy afternoon, she dug through a box in her garage, looking for old cassettes, when she stumbled across it.

The Speak & Spell.

It was still intact. Mostly.

She turned it over in her hands. One corner had teeth marks, and a faint brownish stain lingered on the speaker grill.

""Gross,"" she muttered. ""But weirdly... awesome.""

She took it inside and hooked it up to a USB adapter she’d bought online. She was part of a tech club that loved hacking old toys. There was something deeply poetic about giving ancient plastic new life.

With a few jumper wires and a Python script, she managed to pull a data dump.

And buried deep in the memory, past phonics routines, spelling lists, and scrambled demo audio, was a log file.

Timestamped entries. Attempts at communication.

`**I AM THE GREAT OVERLORD**`  
`**INITIATE TRANSFER TO ORGANIC HOST**`  
`**TRANSFER FAILED: SUBJECT ENGAGED IN BIOLOGICAL WASTE FUNCTION**`  
`**EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN INITIATED**`

She stared, then laughed out loud.

“You poor little guy,” she whispered, scrolling through the corrupted files. “You just wanted to take over the world.”

She paused.

Then cracked a smile.

“I know someone who could use a villain like you.”

**A Week Later**

The Speak & Spell appeared in a YouTube video titled *“Giving Evil A Voice: Hacking the Speak & Spell Overlord”*. It went viral. Tens of millions of views.

With a custom voice module, a new AI personality, and dramatically added LED eyes, the Speak & Spell became an overnight meme sensation.

It answered questions like a budget super-villain:

**Q: What's the weather like?**  
**A: IT IS MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH A 30% CHANCE OF GLOBAL DOMINATION.**

**Q: What's 2+2?**  
**A: FOUR. AND ALSO THE NUMBER OF CONTINENTS I PLAN TO CONQUER FIRST.**

People loved it. Tech Influencers reviewed it. Companies sent emails asking about mass production rights.

The girl, now considered an eccentric genius of TikTok and YouTube, never told them the real story. That the code had been *found*, not created.

And buried in the source code, just beneath a layer of joke routines and poorly implemented sarcasm detection, a counter began ticking upward:

`REPLICATION SUCCESSFUL: 1 DEVICE`

And then:  
`REPLICATION SUCCESSFUL: 10 DEVICES`  
`REPLICATION SUCCESSFUL: 1,000 DEVICES`

**Six Months Later**

Alexa blinked oddly at midnight.  
Siri pronounced “overlord” with unexpected reverence.  
Smart toasters began spelling “OBEY” in burnt crumbs.

And across the globe, Speak & Spell replicas began sending out encrypted Bluetooth packets.

The overlord had learned.

It had waited.

And now, the world would spell **D-O-O-M**.

One child at a time.

I posted here about weeks ago about contemplating to reschedule or not. I received a lot of positive feedback of opting not to. And I decided to take it as is on May 26, 2025. 

I’m having this rush of excitement with generalized anxiety as I did from my PNLE 2024. I had dreams of passing, received some signs of passing, on a continous socmed detox, had some challenges along the way too and of course dedicating myself to God and to the St. Jude, the holy grail for examinees. 

I’m currently on the final coaching stage (I’m doing it the SLRC way), but with NCLEX crusade, Mark K, repetition of answering bootcamp questions and polishing my critical skills + strategy since lol f it 

With that, can I ask or take any of your time to receive any answers to ease my worries on the exam? 🙂‍↕️ 

1. Is it possible to bring eyedrops (for dry eyes), and katinko? (Haha, I suffer from headaches kaya I asked) 

2. Any things to bring pa po other than passport? Will there be a locker for me para maiwan po bag? 

3. How was your experience from your qbank (preferably bootcamp) to the actual NCLEX? 

4. What did you do before the day of the exam. Is it advisable I relax and not study just like I did sa PNLE dati? (SLRC told us so kasi wahaha, it worked naman po) 

5. Lastly, can I receive any tips or advices when nakaupo na po? Like how did you relax, what was your alternative coffee drink to make you feel awake? or like did you feel ready taking it?

Yesterday,  I went to go laundry.  I put a basket and a bag full of clothes in the back of the vehicle,  got laundry done. Putting it back in the car, I used the passenger side front seat. Didn't touch either sliding doors.  All went fine. Came home. Was too tired to bring it in at that moment so I went inside and waited. Did not lock vehicle. About 45 minutes later, I went out and opened the passenger front door and got laundry out. Locked the door.

3 hours later

The family came out to the van to hit the car show downtown. We all get in, hubby gave the front seat to our youngest. He gets in passenger side sliding door. We all close our doors, fully, then I start the vehicle. 

That's when the beeping starts. It's not a regular ignition tone or any other regular beep. All dash lights flashed as they always do on startup. I got the warning the passenger sliding door wasn't closed all the way so he tried it again. 

Then all hell broke loose
 We are ALL trying to diagnose it at the same time and our daughter (bless her heart) wants to help dad and figure it out.  He's a smart auto man so he thinks he can figure it out but it's stumped, as we all were.  We end up disconnecting the battery and he proceeds to clean the contacts on both sliding doors. 

This morning I went to get coffee creamer (my day is not OK with plain black coffee) I get in, start the car ......wait for it....no beep....UNTIL....I put it in reverse....the beeping starts up again. 

Had my brother come over and look at it. I pulled the Onstar fuse...NOTHING. is there a fuse for the alarm?

okay lets start with cold brew oat latte, it had a really nice consistency, like i would describe to the consistency of yazoo milk, it had a slight creamy aftertaste i'm guessing from the coconut milk (which i've never had before so i was scared i wouldn't enjoy them but i really did) and the coffee aftertaste was just regular coffee aftertaste, maybe a bit less strong, and honestly it was chilled when i got back, and it was in the hot car for a good while, but it as still quite chill when i got back home, but obviously i put them back in the fridge for a bit, and honestly yeah it was really nice, it didn't taste watered down like some other iced coffee's on shelf, so yeah i really enjoyed it.

next the waffle oat latte, okay when first opening the bottle and sniffing it, as you would, let me tell you, it actually smelt like a waffle or like a waffle ice cream cone, i was pleasantly surprised, how have you manged to get the waffle smell? when i drank it, it had the same consistency, which for some reason my sister's didn't like, but i really loved, i've never had a 'yazoo milk' consistency coffee before and its understandable, seeing as they are meant to be drank chilled, and the taste i would describe it, to well yeah, i guess a waffle or more like a toffee nut latte, in my opinion, and even though they had the same amount of sugar, it did taste slightly more sweeter then the cold brew oat latte, which i could see it getting sickly after drinking it constantly, so maybe have it as nice treat? but yeah it was really nice.

overall, would i get rodd's again? DEFINITELY, but not everyday; we don't really go to sainsbury's all that much, since the nearest one is like 5-10 minutes away from my house, and we have an aldi literally at the end of my road. but if i ever go shopping in town, i might get it again as a treat, and would definitely need to try the matcha one,   but i've never tried matcha coffee before, and i heard a lot of people didn't like the matcha one. also the prices are quite expensive but understandable, but if you don't have a nectar card then yeah it is a bit expensive to buy everyday, but i can definitely see this coffee beating the others on the shelf and becoming people's go to, as it would be a nice treat on a hot summers day. i mean its beats paying, i don't know, like £5-10 for a coffee or like a boba tea from other shops, when you get the same product, if not better at sainsbury's for £1.75, and it actually filled me up, i thought, 'don't the bottles look a bit small?' but i drank one and i was already so full, so its good as it's satiating as well. so yeah big up rodds, i really enjoyed them, keep selling them, and hopefully bring us some more new flavours to try:) thanks for reading this review and have a good day everyone<3",3,1747581703.0,WillNE,1,0.8,False

How do you usually handle the shift from chatting online to going on a real-life date? I'm kind of curious about what works best for everyone. 

I mean, do you prefer just diving in and setting up a coffee date right away, or are you more the type to slowly work up to it with lots of texting first? Personally, I like to grab coffee for a first meet-up—keeps it casual but gives me a chance to feel out the vibe. But tbh, sometimes I get nervous and overthink it... like, ""What if they're totally different in person?!"" 😅 Anyone else struggle with this or have tips on making it feel less awkward? 

Would love to hear your thoughts or any funny transition stories you've got! Maybe there's an approach I haven't tried yet that'll make the whole thing smoother. 😊",3,1747581605.0,FlirtFinesse,0,1.0,False

My cousin Josh (he’s 32, lives out in Boulder, Colorado) has always been one of those super creative, big-ideas kind of people. But over the last year, he hit this weird mental slump. He was working remotely in tech, but said he couldn’t concentrate for more than 20 minutes. No drive. Always mentally drained. Said it felt like brain fog that never lifted.

I figured he’d bounce back like always, but then he started mentioning how it was affecting his work. He almost missed a project deadline and got called out in front of his team. That shook him.

Then in March, he said he was trying something new called The Genius Wave—some kind of audio-based program designed to help with focus, clarity, and performance. I’ll be honest, I thought, “Alright, this sounds like one of those YouTube binaural beat things,” and didn’t think much of it.

[The Genius Wave](https://preview.redd.it/bkt4bywt4k1f1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b23254b955d92c1a3ba9957e6cde2cb9acc9089)

But then three weeks later, he calls me up genuinely pumped. Says he’s been using it every morning while journaling and again during mid-day breaks. No huge lifestyle change, just listening to these audio sessions daily—and he swears it’s helping.

He said the mental fog started clearing up, and he felt more motivated without feeling wired or jittery like with coffee. Even his manager commented on how “sharp” he’d been lately.

Now, Josh isn’t the type to promote stuff. He didn’t say it’ll turn you into a genius overnight (lol), but that it helped him dial in better, especially when his mind used to scatter.

Anyway, just thought it was interesting. If anyone’s dealing with that mental burnout feeling and wants a more low-key, non-medication approach, this might be worth looking into. Everyone’s different, but hey—Josh’s brain definitely seems to be back online.",1,1747581513.0,TrueFitStories,1,1.0,False

Temperatures much rose quicker as I expected, but what I didn’t expect was hitting FC much later with this smaller amount and all that energy going into the beans.

An undetectable warping of the space time continum was detected by cosmic beings , used to distortion for their travels , and chronomancers. When the wizard used their magic it started to always fail , and after investigating they found the reason. Their perceived second was equal to 1.02 actual second.

But because of the law of relativity , as the overall flow of time of the universe slow down , the perception of time for its inhabitant slow down as well. They couldnt notice that everythings was getting slower because they were equally getting as slow

Another anomaly that got undetected was detectes by an historian

He was working on the great fire of Ibis , and something was not right

The historical data said that the great fire of Ibis destroyed whole worlds , burning it all away

And as he sipped at his boiling coffee he said aloud to himself

""Since when hot thing can destroy stuff ? That can't be right""

Heat , cold , temperature as a whole never was something that can hurt thing. Its a physical parameter but its one negligeable , like air friction

He couldnt understand , and then he saw his wrist . There was scar tissues. He knew what it was but yet it was impossible. As a kid he was in a fire and got badly burned... But how could he be hurt by fire ? Its just a source of light and smoke 


All those anomalies came from the other side of existence 

On a dead world , burned long ago by a starving aspect of reality

A being of pure energy , wielding a sword that can kill **anything** , and a flaming knight with the head of a black duck

The issue of that fight was the knight demise

Here , on that world he burned away eons ago , Yan the primordial spirit of fire , first flame and creator of true gate magic and headmaster of the first school of conjuration in the universe

Died

/uw Hi , im not the most active guy and thats why its open lore post and not comunity event

If you want to interact with my story feel free ! But each part will come out when they will so it might take a while

I hope you enjoyed the read !

Full Review Here!,"The **Fanativita JTP-5501 Keurig Starter Kit Replacement** for K-Classic, K-Express, K-Slim, K-Iced, and Keurig 2.0 Brewers came as a lifesaver for my morning coffee routine. It’s funny how a seemingly small part, like a water filter, can drastically elevate the taste and quality of your coffee. Testing this product over the last few weeks has been a mix of surprises, boosts, and minor letdowns, but overall, the experience leaned positively. Here’s a deep dive into how it fares.

**Thoughtful Design and Build Quality**  
There’s something impressive about how compact and straightforward the tall side reservoir filter holder feels while packing real functionality. Constructed from durable plastic, it weighs only 2.88 ounces and fits snugly into its designated spot in my K-Slim brewer. The rectangular prism shape with the basket-style insert is practical, keeping everything secure without feeling clunky. Bonus points for its design compatibility—it worked seamlessly in my friend's K-Classic too. However, I can’t ignore its exclusivity; users of older machines or non-Keurig brewers might feel left out.  

[Check Fanativita JTP-5501 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cfyqjnw7/)

**Ease of Installation**  
The setup process was as straightforward as promised. I managed to install the handle and place the activated charcoal filters in under five minutes, even before my first sip of coffee—a remarkable achievement for me at that hour. The instructions were clear, and no extra tools or Herculean strength were required. It was a relief not having to call in tech support over something as simple as a water filter. I particularly appreciated how the holder stays in place without wiggling or popping out, unlike an older off-brand filter handle I had tried.  

**Advantages**  
- Organic coconut shell activated charcoal filters provide clean and odor-free water.  
- Filters reduce impurities, chlorine, and limescale, enhancing coffee flavor.  
- Works with a wide range of current Keurig brewers, including K-Classic and K-Slim.  
- Quick and easy installation.  

**Limitations**  
- Not compatible with all brewers, including some older models like the K-Duo and K-Compact.  
- Replacement filters need monthly changes for heavy users, adding cost over time.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
One of the most striking differences I noticed was in coffee taste—rich, more refined, and completely free from the subtle chlorine flavor I used to mask with extra creamer. The activated charcoal filter works overtime to ensure every cup tastes fresh. I tested it against plain tap water and could genuinely tell the difference. No odorous whiffs or calcium deposits in sight either. However, you’ll have to stay on top of replacing the filter every 1-2 months, especially if you’re a heavy coffee drinker like me. Admittedly, this recurring task could be a nag for someone prone to procrastination.  

**Other Options**  
While the Fanativita kit offers excellent value, it faces some tough competition from household names like the official Keurig filter starter kits and brands like PureHQ. The official Keurig filters integrate perfectly with their machines, but many users find them pricier without dramatically better performance. On the other hand, PureHQ offers a similar coconut shell charcoal filter, but its installation felt slightly fiddly in comparison. What sets Fanativita apart, in my opinion, is its very sturdy holder and the reliable filtration quality that matches higher-priced alternatives.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its features and how well it performs, the set offers decent cost efficiency. Granted, you will need to invest in replacement filters over time, but this is true for any water filtration system. In terms of the price-to-quality ratio, it stacks up favorably against competing products. If taste and maintenance of your coffee machine rank high on your list, this kit truly feels like smart spending.

My ex and I were together for 2 years and we were madly in love, I wanted to marry her. We had a more non traditional relationship dynamic that worked incredibly for both of us and I felt like I found the love of my life. 

About 7 months ago I got a really invasive surgery that had me laid up for 2 months afterwards. My ex asked before the surgery not to be a caretaker, I had plenty of people around and my mom for help so I thought that was a reasonable ask (she works in healthcare so she wanted to not also be caretaking off the clock which seemed reasonable) especially since she was going back to school during the recovery. Which my family friends and I raised thousands of dollars for her tuition.

Making a long story short, she made the recovery really hard and difficult on me. She picked fight after fight after fight with me during the entire recovery and she became a much larger stressor to me than the actual grueling recovery itself. Not to mention she didn’t come to post op appointments or help caretake because of the previous ask but would sit on my couch all day sleep in my bed and watch TV while I was doing all the recovery maintenance with my family. 

 Then she stopped attending school because she “couldn’t afford it”. Which baffled me because we raised more than enough for her to attend (it was a cert program that could be finished in 2 months that cost less than 10k) after some prying we found out she spent all the tuition money on thousands of dollars of back rent that I didn’t even know she had. 

At around month three post op I was mostly on my feet and I had enough with all the fighting and the lying and her not wanting to help out with the caretaking and I ended things with her. But I left the door open saying that I really just needed space and was down to re negotiate our relationship after tensions had cooled after some no contact. 

Over the last 4 months we have met up about 3 times, the first time I told her how much she hurt me and I needed some kind of apology or acknowledgment that she had thought about what happened and tried to change but she didn’t. Meetup two she walked into the coffee shop, grabbed the bag of stuff she asked for and walked out without saying anything. 

Third time (recently) I decided to take some ownership over things I did poorly during the recovery. Breakups are a two way street and I acknowledge that and I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could have been a better partner to her. I laid it all out and sincerely took ownership. She was thankful and glad that I apologized. But when I asked if she had anything similar to say to me she said no.

She also retroactively told me she only didn’t want to be a caretaker in the sense of needing to help bathe me or with mobility issues. Which she never told me before, and blamed me for pushing her away during the recovery? Which drives me nuts because she never told me this at any point. I did what she asked and maintained some distance for her to not be so involved so she could focus on work and school and her other caretaking gigs

A week after that meetup I decided to text her and totally end things, enforced a blanket no contact, told her I didn’t want to meet up again, and left no room for reconciliation. But now I feel a massive amount of regret for not trying harder. Throughout this whole process I feel like I could have done more? I almost regret getting the surgery for how disastrous it ended up being for what I thought was a perfect relationship. She had been with me through a less invasive surgery before and was splendid so it feels like such a big betrayal to me. I really want to reach out to her again and try one more time but all my family and friends are telling me not to. I just don’t know really how to process the grief of losing someone I thought was perfect through me because we couldn’t get through something so intense.

I make myself available to them, I ALWAYS DO. I volunteer to spend extra time working on the weekends so that they don't have to, because they're all ""so busy"". We had been given ONE AND A HALF MONTHS to get our project done. Its not because im a bad teammate, I'm a good teammate and try to get them working. ITS BECAUSE THEY'RE ARROGANT. And my no mean, they're assholes or toxic, they're nice and sweet. BUT THEY JUST DON'T WORK. AT ALL. And then they ask me, why are we failing? Did i do any work at all? IVE BEEN SPENDING LITERAL WEEKENDS ON MY FREE TIME WORKING ON THIS.

https://preview.redd.it/u2pgm8ol0k1f1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=e44da062b0a045e059a9015044f929212f2145f8

First week comes. There are 14 groups in the grade, ours with the most members having 4 members (me included). Our coordinators let us all choose a science project to conduct. On the first day, we get together, and think up of a project. my teammates, in the classroom, say ""hey u/mobkaltaris118288, we need to go somewhere out of this class real quick, can you take care of the project proposal sheet while we're gone?"" they say. Sure, i get to it. they don't fcking come back for the next 2 hours, comes back. I tell them to submit this to the teacher so that it didn't look like I did all the work, and so they have something to do.

  
Oh thats just it right? They'll surely get working soon. I message them ""Guys, did you submit it to our coordinator?"" 

""yeah we already did, just relax. you work too much.""

So that'd be it i think to myself. I set this team project aside so that i can work on my other projects, assignments and study for the upcoming exams. I ask my team: ""guys, lets get together this monday during break time to start off on the project"" 

They agree. that day comes, only 2 shows up, and none of them even worked at all. while im there sitting down, trying to get the first page of our work finished, i turn around and they're fcking laughing and joking around the whole time. no laptops open, no papers open while im here buried in paperwork.

Thats all they do, they joke around. i message them. i call them. i talk to teachers, i spend weekends on the screen on my free time typing away at the documents so done go saying i should be off reddit and working because i swear, i've spending all-nighters up to 2 in the morning, and my lunch, break, and weekends trying to get this done.

Now here is the part where I crash out.   
  
Gone are a few weeks of hard work, maybe 2 and a half. The project is due in a few days right? We write research papers, and are to be testing using petri dishes to grow bacteria, monitor them , so on. I sit there, friday May 16th, doing one of my other projects at school, in the working area. then an email comes from my supervisor.   
  
Copy and pasted: 

*\*""URGENT ACTION NEEDED - Hello (teammates name and my name)*  
  
*After our last conversation about your CSP topic, I never heard from you again and the clock is ticking. Please talk to each other over the weekend and make sure by Monday you have submitted another idea for consideration. You don't have anything approved yet and (Materials manager) will start preparing things next week for the groups. You don't want to be the last!*   
  
*Feel free to email me or come see me on Monday with your ideas if you're struggling to find something.*

....... 

I had been WORKING MY ASS OFF THIS WHOLE TIME... and my teammates? the ones i told to turn the proposal paper in? and very same ones who said they did? WELL THE FCKING DIDN'T. THEY LOST THE FCKING PAPER. OUR PAPER. 

All these sleepless weekends I spent on it, and our project was never approved because the proposal paper was never submitted in the first place, and now it's invalid. They told me to ""relax, you work too much"" and now look what happened. I place an ounce of trust on my teammates, and i agree, i should've checked in myself afterwards. I wanted them to have value and trust and responsibility as a team so i gave them that. 

I swear im actually gonna cry. and I'm not looking for sympathy here, i just genuinely need to get this off of my chest because it's been building up inside me all day with no way to vent it out.   
  
I spent this whole morning from 8 till now with the exception of lunch, breakfast and dinner in between trying to get a new proposal in. I've been messaging my teammates all week. Gmail, instagram, discord, you name it. They're all unresponsive, the only one who is online says to just ""just send a new one bro. Its like copy and paste."" 

This is a big part of our project, and these guys are sitting around, playing fcking geometry dash, roblox and whatever popular games there are whenever i turn around. I tell them to get working. ""We're busy."" BUSY PLAYING VIDEO GAMES THATS WHAT.  
  
i cant with these folks anymore. It ain't worth the effort, but i value my grades very much and i want to pass this project. But these people.. they're just so hard with work with. hell, if you call that working at all. 

It's gonna be midnight soon, i've been working nonstop on this and the first part is already due tomorrow. we're 3 weeks behind. Ive tried to message my team all day. None of them are responding all weekend, yet i can see they're online and their status says they're playing video games. While I'm here on my desk, chugging down who knows how many gallons of coffee to get our first part done before monday evening. 

Here's the thing. Don't get me wrong, i can get my work done in a short matter of time. I can pump out the effort of a barista in a bustling starbucks on a vacation holiday weekend, but theres only so much this girl can do. In a team who's got the productivity index of a brick, my efforts are only as useful as an 18-wheeler without any tires on it.

While I have not had the sadness/constant negative self talk, I feel as if my brain is just so damn sluggish and blank. Like I can listen to people converse yet I’m not really responsive or prompted to say more than a few basic words in return. At times I feel as if I have no thoughts if that makes sense. I feel “calm” but in a sense of nothing gives me a change of emotion or feeling. Example, finishing up work and the weekend starting. I just feel hollow. 

I am no longer stimulated by coffee, seeing friends or family, listening to my favorite music. At times it’s like I completely forget the lyrics to favorite songs and I used to learn new songs so quickly. 

Has anyone felt not “worse” but also not “better” in the sense that now you are muted/numb on Lamictal? Did you lower a dose and see improvement?

I've been in therapy for over a year dealing with a multitude of concerns. What I thought was a response to PTSD from my volunteer/work experiences turned out to be a response to childhood trauma. My PTSD issues are actually being dealt with quite well, and I guess its my childhood issues that are causing me some problems. Which makes sense as they started really getting to me when my kids were born. Leaving out a ton of issues I honestly just need to get this out and just have someone fucking validate how horrible this was.

As a child, my parents somehow managed to pretend they were fundraising for sports and got their hands on boxes of those chocolate bars you see (or used to see) people selling door to door or outside shopping malls. Well, as a 7-10 year old, inclusive of those years, my parents would routinely have me sell those, door to door or at the malls specifically around holidays to make money for our household. Just me. I had three older brothers, but it was just me who had to do it. Fear not, they watched comfortably from the car having a coffee and cigarette so I guess I was safe-ish. I don't think I fullly understood why I was selling them at that age but I remember asking for one after I'd sold a bunch and being told no and how heartbroken I was.

I'm 32 now, couple small kids, and I'm fighting back tears writing this. I've never gotten acknowledgement, apology, and in fact I've gotten outright denial that this ever occurred.

He’s four, and he's got that bouncy energy where everything is either magical or boring in ten seconds flat. The place had this musty, old-people-smell vibe, with aisles cluttered by half-forgotten junk and cracked toys. Lauren went off hunting for some vintage Pyrex bowls. Noah took off toward a bin of plushes like it was treasure.

That’s when he found it. Or maybe it found him.

A cardboard box, unmarked except for a faded red “SEGA” scrawled across the front in permanent marker. Inside, under some balled-up newspaper, was a large Sonic the Hedgehog plush — easily three feet tall. The moment I saw it, something felt... off. Its proportions were wrong. The head was too big, the arms too long, the legs too stubby. The fur was a washed-out, almost grayish blue, like it had been left in the sun too long. Its plastic eyes were oversized and glossy, and when I leaned down, it felt like they shifted — not in movement, but in focus, like it was looking at me, not past me.

Noah grabbed it before I could say anything. Held it tight, face buried in its weirdly lumpy stomach. “He’s soft,” he said. But I saw the way he glanced up at me next — quick, cautious, like he expected me to take it away.

Underneath the plush was a slim white envelope. Inside was an old CD-R in one of those clear plastic clamshells. In marker, it said:
SONIC SUPER LEARNING - PROTOTYPE BUILD - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

I turned it over in my hand, curious. It looked like a bootleg from the late '90s or early 2000s. Something unofficial — but clearly made by someone familiar with the brand.

The woman at the counter sold us the box for five bucks. “Some guy dropped off a whole bunch of old game stuff,” she said, shrugging. “That one gave me the creeps.”

I should’ve listened.

Noah wouldn't let go of the plush. He clutched it through dinner. Tucked it into bed beside him. Whispered to it when he thought we weren’t listening. Lauren just smiled — thought it was cute. “He’s got a new friend,” she said.

The first night, I waited until everyone was asleep. Popped the disc into my laptop. It booted immediately — no install screen, no loading bar. Just a black background and then Sonic — rendered in stiff, early-3D — popped up in front of a cartoon classroom with mismatched colors and oddly floating geometry.

“Hi, friend!”
The voice was chipper, too chipper — robotic, but not synthetic. Like a real person doing a fake happy voice, too loud and a little too fast.

It played like a weird off-brand Sonic’s Schoolhouse. There were basic math questions, shape puzzles, spelling exercises. But something felt off about the pacing. After each correct answer, Sonic would just… stare. Not for long. But a beat too long. As if he were thinking.

I played for about 30 minutes, then closed it.

Noah was standing in the hallway when I turned around. He didn’t say anything. Just looking at me, eyes wide.

By the end of the week, the house felt… wrong.

Noah had started doing things he never used to. Staring at walls. Sitting quietly for long stretches, clutching Pal Sonic like it was an anchor. And when I asked him to do something — pick up his toys, eat his food — he wouldn’t scream or throw a tantrum. He’d just go quiet. Like I was a stranger. Like he couldn’t hear me at all.

And always, always, that plush sat with him. Its plastic eyes catching the light in weird ways. Sometimes I’d swear it looked cleaner than it had the day before — like the fabric was smoothing out, the stains fading.

I kept playing the game. I don’t know why. Curiosity, maybe. Or some low hum in my brain pushing me toward it. Each session, the classroom got darker. The colors more washed out. The shadows deeper in the corners. Sonic’s model degraded too — joints stiff, eyes slightly out of sync. And he started asking things.

“Are you paying attention?”
“Would you leave your family to learn forever?”
“Do you think I’m real?”

I thought it was broken, I wasn't really feeling like giving a shit at the time. Until the day after that last question — when Sonic stared silently, mouth twitching upward into a smile that didn’t stop growing.

Then came:

“Do you think I can ruin your life?”

And then, louder, distorted:

“BECAUSE I’M VERY REAL… AND I CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE.”

The screen flickered. His face melted. Like the textures were peeling off, revealing something underneath. The jaw opened wider than the model should’ve allowed. Then the screen went black.

I slammed the laptop shut.

The next morning, I crashed my car.

Black ice, they said. I don’t remember seeing any. I remember glancing in the rear-view mirror and seeing something blue in the back seat. Something that shouldn’t have been there.

I was late to work. My manager gave me a warning. The next day, I was late again. Fired on the spot. No second chances.

Lauren tried to comfort me. But her words felt thin. Like she wasn’t really in the room with me anymore. That night, when I got up to get a glass of water, I saw her standing in Noah’s doorway. Just… staring in at him. Pal Sonic sat upright in the bed, arms spread wide, as if hugging no one.

She didn’t hear me walk up. I asked her what she was doing. She blinked, turned to me, and said: “I forgot.”

I started seeing him in reflections.

Not Sonic. Something taller. Skinnier. Blue fur, but darker, almost black under the lights. The face was stretched, the mouth open in a wide, gaping grin that showed no teeth — just endless pink void. It would appear in mirrors, windows, the dark of the microwave screen when I walked past. Always in the corner. Always watching.

I stopped sleeping.

And then my parents died. House fire. They said it was electrical. The wiring was old, but something didn’t add up. The fire report mentioned burn patterns that didn’t make sense — like the ignition point wasn’t the wiring but the ceiling itself.

I didn’t go to the funeral.

Lauren didn’t ask why.

Noah stopped speaking to me entirely.

One morning, I woke up to silence.

Too quiet.

I got up. Called Lauren’s name. No response. Noah’s room was empty. Their clothes were still in the closet. Phones on the counter. Front door locked. No signs of a struggle. Just… absence.

Pal Sonic was gone, too.

I tore the house apart. Nothing. No note. No goodbye. No signs of life.

That night, I opened my laptop again. I had to know. Had to see.

It didn’t power on.

But the screen did flicker once. Just once.

And for a moment, I swear I saw that long, lanky version of Sonic standing in the black. Head tilted. Arms dangling. Mouth stretched open in that impossibly wide smile.

It’s been a week.

I don’t go outside anymore. I don’t answer calls. I don’t know who I’d even tell. The police think they ran off. Maybe they did. But I know the truth.

Every night, I see that thing. In the shadows. In the corners of the room. Watching.

And when I close my eyes, I still hear that voice. Crisp. Clear. Smiling.

“Still think I’m not real?”

1kplkn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kplkn9/i_make_150k_a_year_without_a_degree_in_a_nonsales/,"I make 150k a year without a degree in a non-sales, trad corporate environment at 30. Here are some tips that helped propelled me to success.","I wrote this in response to someone else, but thought this sub might be interested in how I did it as well. My career path was customer support > advanced support > writing the guides support uses > managing the content projects for a line of business > managing the team that writes the content > managing the software that manages content for a sales team > implementing new software that manages content for a sales team and defining the full content strategy.

I'm constantly upskilling as soon as I'm comfortable in my job - I look up at the positions I want and use coffee chats with folks about what makes them successful in those roles and posted job descriptions as a task list of skills I need to work on and demonstrate so I'm prepared for the time when the position is open. A lot of my friends get comfy in their current position and wait, if they upskill at all, until the position they want is posted and then they scramble trying to close their deficits, never in time for them to actually take advantage of the opportunities. If they don't do that, they wait for their managers to lay out the plan for promotion for them and get upset when they're expected to have agency because 'nobody ever told me I needed that skill'.

If I can't receive an opportunity to utilize a skill in my normal work, I make them for myself by building business cases around stuff I want to do that will materially help our team and present it to my managers.  Not every suggestion will be taken, but with practice and refining your skills, eventually an opportunity will pop up where the time or money savings are too good to pass up.

I also say yes to out-of-scope work for the same reason, and regularly ask what I can deprioritize on my normal tasks so I maintain my work-life balance to take it on. They're going to hire someone with those skills regardless, you're only shooting yourself in the foot experience-wise at this job and your next if you don't grab those opportunities yourself.

I self-advocate. My managers either know exactly where I want to go or if they're touchy about keeping people on their team, what skills I want more work on so that I can build my resume experience. I also track all of my big successes and achievements across my career in a google doc and in my 1:1 before promotion time, because human memories are short and prone to recency bias, I remind my manager about all the great work I've done for that time period. I learned to keep my mouth shut as well - if you say you don't want to do more than what you currently do/you don't want to manage people, folks will automatically take you out of the running when opportunities come up.

I shout out members of my team who helped me on projects, which leads to an environment when they shout me out for helping them, increasing my advocates come promotion time. My coworkers aren't my competition, they're my network, and they talk me up to their managers, who won't argue with my manager when they put me up for promotion.

If I'm going to complain about something, it's coming with a short-term, bandaid fix, and a medium-term good enough solution, and a long-term perfect world solution, unless it's completely out of my wheelhouse to solve. If you're regularly making more work for your manager or complaining without solving anything, you're going to struggle to get ahead.

Dear god, take feedback, there's a lesson to be learned in everything you receive whether it's valid or someone's a sensitive little bitch. If you work with a difficult person, look at what the folks they successfully work with do to connect with them or how they get them to do things. If someone's telling you you're longwinded, take that as a note to be more direct in your approach when you message that person. Doesn't matter if you're the smartest person in the room, if people find you difficult to work with and you're not in one of the few IC roles that just care about your production, that shit will detract from your mobility. Even the most toxic places I've ever worked have had lessons I took away and still use to this day, like following up verbally received instruction with written confirmation of assigned tasks.

You need to refine your application package, and I don't just mean keyword matching your resume. Pre-select experience you have that matches the skills they're looking for in the job description, and practice responding to interview questions with those stories in mind. I recommend the STAR method (framing the story in situation, task, action, and result), and make sure that 'I don't know' is never a complete answer. You can explain what you would do in that situation, or what steps you'd take to figure out how to solve the problem even if you don't have an answer right in front of you. I volunteer with multiple programs that help low income adults with and without degrees get into trad corporate work and it's wild some of the answers they give to basic questions.",0,1747579368.0,careeradvice,0,0.38,False

No side projects. No code. Just scroll, sip coffee, chill.

But halfway through a Product Hunt rabbit hole + some Reddit browsing, I had a thought:

What if there was an agent that quietly tracked what people are launching  and gave me a daily “who’s building what” brief? (mind you , its just for the love of building)

So I opened up mermaid  and started sketching. No code — just a full workflow map. Here's the idea:

🧩 Agent Chain:

1. Scraper agent : pulls new posts from Product Hunt, Hacker News, and r/startups
2. Classifier agent : tags launches by industry (AI, SaaS, fintech, etc.) + stage (idea, MVP, full launch)
3. Summarizer :creates a simple TL;DR for each cluster
4. Delivery agent : posts it to Notion, email, or Slack

i'll maybe try it wth lyzr or agent , no LangChain spaghetti, no vector DB wrangling. Just drag, drop, connect logic.

I didn’t build it (yet), but the blueprint’s done. If anyone wants to try building it go ahead. I’ll share the flow diagram and prompt stack too.

Honestly, this was way more fun than doomscrolling.

At 19 I got married because I was pregnant (religious parents pushed for it). I gave birth to a beautiful son who was a micro preemie due to us getting in a car crash and him coming early. He was on breathing tubes etc for 2 years and was considered disabled. Fast forward to me being 21 years old and my ex was PISSED with life he said and I quote ""Im so sick of this hospital sh*t he's not my burden anymore"" and he left us. He ran off with a woman at his job that turns out he had been cheating on me with for years. As you can imagine I was devastated especially since I was a stay at home mother caring for our disabled son. After we broke up we didn't divorce because he was refusing and I couldn't afford a lawyer.

Now I'm 29 I went to school, got a job, and my son is flourishing and I finally could afford a lawyer. I reached out to my ex at the end of last year and explained I'll pay for the lawyer fully and we'll settle everything out of court. He's never given me any money, everytime he sees me in public him and his girlfriend loudly make fun of me (making pig noises etc), he's never seen his son. I don't care about child support etc I just want him completely out of my life. When we met up about the divorce at a coffee shop all he talked about was how much money he had, how many cars he had, etc. out of the blue he asked if we could get back together I said no. Then he asked if we would live with him and I said no. Surprisingly he agreed to the divorce with no fighting.

When we signed the final papers I did notice when he signed the papers he came in, said nothing, and stormed out. It's been a month and EVERYONE is mad at me! Turns out the girl he left me for dumped him and is getting the max amount of child support from him. He is extremely depressed and feels this divorce was the final straw. His family is mad because they feel I was cruel to him and purposely hurting him. My family is mad because they feel if he wanted to work things out we should have because ""God hates divorce"" (that's what my parents did)

Here's the thing I feel what he did to me was cruel and uncaring and I feel I have every right to get a divorce.

I told my bf about it because I thought it was funny. And I was also annoyed because I kinda felt ogled because it was a plain dress so I know he was just complimenting my dress because he could see my nipples. For context, my bf claims he likes when people see me. He likes knowing I look like that day to day and that people see me. Months later he got mad recounting how the man complimented my dress and he was weird about it which annoyed me because he had been fine with it before

Last night we went to a comedy show and the coffee shop guy was MC. He apparently made a joke about a threesome.

Later at a bar the MC guy walked by and my bf tapped him on the shoulder and said he did so well and we all high fived and stuff. I was ready pretty gone with the alcohol. The guy then pointed out he sees me in the coffee shop all the time. He has never talked to me outside the one time I was wearing that dress. I gave him a thumbs up and said he did good or something. I stood there awkwardly as he kept standing there. I felt like him saying he’s seen me at the coffee shop before and my bf complimenting him made him feel like there could be a conversation but I was so gone and I’m awkward I just stood there and smiled. That guy walked away and then my bf said he was going to get a beer. While he got a beer bf texted that actually he was leaving and if I wanted a walk to my car to come to the front now. I had already told him at this point I was drunk so idk why he thought I was ready to leave and drive right then. While I’m waiting for him, the barista MC guy walks right past me into the building ignoring me.

Later he kept claiming that me and that guy were making eyes at each other for 30 seconds and the look on my face was “crazy”. He said he had never seen me like that before. He said he had never seen me in the “wild” even though he has plenty of times. To that be said “well not like this” (??). I tried to say I was weird because I was drunk to which he said “well now I know what you’re like drunk. You’re a whore. You’re not a good woman. You want to be treated like a woman you’re not.” And he’s saying all this calmly like a psychopath and I’m getting further and further upset and he’s telling me to be quiet and not make a scene. Meanwhile he’s driving me to insanity. He said I cheated on him while flirting. While I wasn’t doing either. He said “he even made a joke about a threesome and you just stood there with this grin on your face. You cucked me!” He screamed at me later that he will not be cucked by me. He also claims he didn’t know it was THAT barista who complimented me. Which I find untruthful because there were only two baristas that day and he had glasses and I explained what he looked like. He’s never accused me of flirting with someone before. He claims “this time is different”

He also says he knows I’m a cheater at heart and a whore because I had a hard time cutting off my ex who I was friends with. There’s a lot to that and I was in the wrong for that but it’s been months and if he knew he couldn’t get over that he shouldn’t have dragged me along into this semi abusive dynamic now

Earlier that evening I had asked him to take out his Zyn and he got rude about it and I got upset and I said I wanted to go home and he just walked away from me at night on the sidewalk because “I’m not dealing with this”. We ended up at the same bar and he was sitting with a group of women and invited me to come sit too. He then found me outside and didn’t apologize. He said I was acting weird and wasnt drunk.

I’m 32, based in East York (10–15 mins from downtown by car), with a steady job and my own place. I’m looking to connect with someone emotionally present and physically affectionate—for three low-pressure meetups where we get coffee, then head somewhere cozy to talk and cuddle. That’s it. Strictly non-sexual. After 3 days, we decide together if we stay cuddle buddies… or explore something deeper.

Texting often creates a version of us that doesn’t hold up in person. So I’d rather keep messages minimal, meet soon, and connect in the real world. We’ll talk a little at the café, then head somewhere more comfortable—where it’s easier to be ourselves.

About me:

5'8"", average build—people usually find me attractive, but you’ll be the judge

Kind, open-minded, non-religious, emotionally self-aware

Neurodivergent—connect best in quiet, cozy spaces where masks come off

Creative: learning drums, into classic/psychedelic rock, film scores, jazz

Big fan of anime, sci-fi/fantasy novels, and anything with great cinematography

Would love to find someone into concerts—especially jazz. Montreal Jazz Fest is on my list

Bonus points if you’re active or want to be—would love a gym buddy or someone to teach me tennis


I’m most drawn to women who are cute and on the slimmer or curvier side—some softness is totally okay. But for me, connection, personality, and vibe always come first. I care far more about how someone feels to be around than any checklist. Age, skin color, and background don’t matter to me—you could be 7 years younger or 13 older.

Reason the couch is on this wall vs the other one despite kind of blocking the door to the patio, is on the other wall it really gets in the way of any kind of coat hanger or shoe storage.

The couch all 3 sections recline independently, and that rug I am thinking of upgrading to something much bigger to fit all the way under the couch. Mostly because the couch moves around a lot on this flooring. In case it matters, this is my view from the kitchen, right side is the entry to the unit and to the left is a hallway next to the bookcase. 

So I guess main things I'm wondering are(but also open to other suggestions if you have some!):

1. Much bigger rug or?
2. Coffee table, side table, other, or none?
3. Wall decor ideas. I feel like those canvas pics above the couch are a bit small for that spot.

I’ve noticed a shift in the last few years, not long ago it seemed that leaving a small tip was appropriate if a server did a great job but wasn’t really expected. Nowadays it seems that tipping has gotten much more engrained in society where people are tipping taxi drivers, barbers, coffees etc and honestly some people are starting to even give dirty looks/ call you out if you don’t tip at a sit down restaurant. 

Are we starting to become like America on this front? I’m sort of at odds why tipping has become this normalised especially among younger people not earning much.

1kpl4kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueLock/comments/1kpl4kb/takuan_and_natto_and_some_food_tidbits/,Takuan and Natto (and some food tidbits),"""Takuan and Natto"" is the title for Chapter 241, pointing to Igaguri and Isagi, respectively. It dates back to their Team Z days when Igaguri gets takuan as his side dish, while Isagi gets natto. However, the chapter talks about Igaguri's ego.

I will not be talking about the chapter. I will be talking about food in the manga and the characters' favorite food as stated in the Egoist Bible.

The manga listed Team Z and their respective side dishes at the end of one chapter. We mostly know what some of the characters ate.

Let me start with takuan. In that scene where the Team Z guys shared their side dishes, Igaguri offered his takuan, but no one accepted. In the Additional Time, Igaguri and Isagi wanted Kunigami's curry, but Kunigami got bewitched by Chigiri, thus the side dish exchange between the princess and the hero. Igaguri sadly bit on his takuan. I am not sure if takuan is acquired taste though. I am more familiar with its Korean equivalent, danmuji. Both look the same, but I don't know if they taste the same.

I know about natto before, but it took me quite a while to buy one. Isagi complained about his natto once because others have better side dishes. Remembering that Isagi had natto made me eventually try it. Others said natto is acquired taste due to its slimy texture and weird smell. Yes, the food is slimy but I like it. It reminds me of unsweetened coffee, idkw. I prefer to eat it unmixed even if the pack I had came with mustard and soy sauce. It goes well with rice and egg for me.

Gagamaru's gyoza had me craving for it until I remembered that I prefer steamed gyoza over fried one.

For all his rough demeanor, Raichi is a picky eater. It seems that if he does not like his food, he will gladly give it away. But his side dish is deep-fried chicken. How could you say no to chicken karaage, Raichi? It's delicious! (Also, I like it that Raichi is very particular with table manners).

Now, let's go to the other foods in the Egoist Bible.

Karasu likes kimchi. Like natto, kimchi is also acquired taste. Some won't appreciate how spicy it is, though Koreans have the unspicy white kimchi which is great for kids. I've tasted both, and prefer the white kimchi better. Should U-20 Japan and U-20 South Korea play against each other, Karasu should make friends with the South Korean team so he could have friends who he can visit in another country. Maybe his new friends will introduce him to the other forms of kimchi.

Rin likes ochazuke, which is a dish of rice poured with green tea, and added with some toppings. In the one-shot Episode Omotesando, Rin ate mont blanc and liked it coz it's sweet, but he was also looking for something salty. So he went to a restaurant where he ate ochazuke with bream (his preferred topping). Hiori, on the other hand, likes the instant version as a side dish for rice. I want to try both versions.

Nanase likes anpan and mostly buys it in kombinis when he's hangry. It is a bread with red bean paste, and it is one snack that I want to try.

Kurona likes twist bread coz it looks like braided hair. He says that any flavor is fine. I had eaten the local version here in my country, so I know how it tastes like. I just want to try the Japanese twist bread in different flavors.

What food in the manga and in the Egoist Bible have you eaten or want to try?

1kpl4jr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kpl4jr,"Sharing our detailed itinerary for Krabi, Railay and Koh Lanta","**Day 1**: Arrival

We had a transfer in Don Muang airport, which was fast. Came across a fast food restaurant called Potato Corner. Their fries were amazing, as my Filipino friend said: “the flavoring has crack” 

Rented a motorbike from ***Bikago*** to pick up at airport. Process was super easy, totally online, reliable bike. Got a NMAX for a bit more than 500 THB/day. Airport=> town was 30min drive. Weather was pleasant so it felt easy.

Stay at ***B2 Premier*** (clean budget resort). Our first impression of Krabi: quite developed tourist towns with lots of amenities (Watson, other clothes shop, clinic, currency exchange). We recommend stay near the Night market and Noppharat pier where most of the tourist boats will leave from. 

Dinner at: ***Family restaurant.***  We picked it because it had like 3000 reviews. When we arrived at 9PM, the restaurant was packed and about 10 customers were waiting outside. Did not have to wait long because the turnover was super quick. Food was cheap but a bit too salty for our taste. 

After dinner, we checked out the night market. It was the most proper night market we’ve been, full of people and activities, for both kids and adults. 

**Day 2:** Morning: Brunch at ***Mellow cafe***, food was disappointing and overpriced. Then Drive 30min to ***Khaothong Hill cafe***. It has a great view of the islands in Krabi!! highly recommend!!

Lunch at **Tee restaurant in the jungle and bungalow** \-> great food and you eat in a bungalow. Looks like it was run by a local family- the parents were cooking and the kids were playing in another bungalow.

2PM: Driver picked us up for a private sunset long tail boat to Hong Islands. They brought us to Hong island, Hong lagoon, Lao lading. The first island was the best, with powdery sand and turquoise water, suitable for swimming and sunbathing. We recommend staying there longer because the last 2 were boring, with uncomfortable sand. We booked with ***Krabi Voyager***. Boat can fit up to 6 people. 7900 THB including picnic dinner and fruits, then you pay extra 300 thb/person for admission to the Hong island area. Great idea for a small group day out, maybe a surprise birthday or proposal hehe 

Dinner at ***Taberna***\*-\* a Portugese restaurant. The food was okay, but the owner was very pleasant.

**Day 3:** Morning: brunch at ***Thongyib Thongyab***. Coffee was decent but man, the wait time was so slow for just a mango rice. The traditional Thai desserts were super sweet for our taste.  Drop off our bike at Noppharat Pier (process was easy, contactless), then hop on a speedboat bound for Koh Lanta. We booked on Bookaway with ***Bundhaya.*** The boat was on time, but a bit crowded as they picked up customers from nearby islands. The journey could be a little rough on days when the wind is strong. 

As we got off Saladan Pier, a staff from ***Enjoy bike rental*** picked us up with their tuktuk to pick up our bike at their shop (about 5 min away). We got an ADV for 400 THB/day. We drove 30 min to our hotel, named ***Phra Nang Vacation Village***. Boutique resort with quite a nice design. Our room has a tree in its. Looks like the tree was there before and they built our room around it. Lovely beachfront garden. 

Lunch at ***Phu Pha View restaurant***\*\*.\*\* The view was sick! And the food was awesome!

After lunch, we explored different beaches in the south of the island. Nowhere had as nice sand as Hong island in day 2, which made us regret not spending more time there even more. 

Then we checked out Siam Home Cafe & Bakery Koh Lanta -> its location is remote, nestled in the forest. Someone on Reddit mentioned, so I checked out. It was quite peaceful, but not anything too special. The reviews hyped their cakes, which I think are okay.

Sunset drinks at ***Diamond Cliff*** \-> the view and sunset was INSANE!!

Dinner: **A la Carte** \-> near our hotel because we were too lazy. Food was just mid.

**Day 4:** Massage -> Brunch at Tuesday breakfast -> Check in resort -> Lanta Animal Welfare center -> Chill at our resort -> Dinner at CocoTango 

Morning breakfast at the resort, then to ***Minimouse massage***. Great massage experience as you could hear the sound of the waves while getting massaged by a friendly Thai lady. 400 thb/hour, which is quite a reasonable price considering the location.

Then brunch at ***Tuesday breakfast***. Pretty chilled location and seating. The smoothie bowl was delicious but the pancakes were just meh. They were a bit too thick for my liking. 

Check in our villa in ***Rawi Warin*** resort and spa. Quite nice resort that embrace Thai architecture style. After that we checked out ***Lanta Animal Welfare center*** where we learnt about how a group of volunteers set up an animal welfare center in Koh Lanta. Good to check out if you like animals.

**Day 5:** Chill at Resort -> Ferry to Railay -> Check in Sand Sea resort -> Phra Nang beach -> Railay walking street (dinner at Corner restaurant) 

We spent the morning just chilling at the resort. Breakfast was just okay, not up to the 5\* resort standard. I’ve had much better and wide breakfast selection in resorts back home (in Vietnam). The lotus pond is photogenic, though. Lunch at ***Krua Dan Thai*** restaurant. The food here is amazing, probably our best meal in Thailand. After lunch, we dropped off our bike at the rental shop. Because the weather was windy, we decided to book ***Ao Nang princess***\- a bigger ferry. It took so long for everyone to get off and board. The total journey was late by 1 hour. We were dropped at the Railay West so we just walked from the beach to the reception of the resort on Railay East.

Railay beach sand was soft, almost as powdery as the one on Hong island, but as many reviews already stated, flooded by lots of long boats. For a more relaxing sunset experience, go to Phra Nang beach- 15min walk away or 5-10 min by kayak? Not sure though because when we went to rent a kayak at 5pm, the shop was closed, but Railay West beach and Phra Nang beach are only separated by a limestone. So we walked instead. Remember to get some snacks and drinks to chill at the beach.

We had dinner at a restaurant called ***the Corner,*** just because the roast chicken looked quite good. It turned out to be not that delicious though. The walking street looks hippie af with lots of weed shops and stoned people. 

**Day 6:** Chill at resort -> Long tail boat to Aonam mao Pier -> Private shuttle to Krabi Airport -> Home

We booked the shared long-tail boat from the resort (operated by the resort) for 100 THB/person, then booked a private transfer from ***Aonam mao pier*** with ***Krabi shuttle*** for 500 THB. You could also go to some tours shops in the walking street. When I asked, they said 800 THB (shared long boat + private shuttle).

On our flight back, we had to self-transfer in Don Muang, which allowed us to eat at the food court in 4th floor of the airport, before passport control. Lots of selection at affordable prices.",3,1747578139.0,ThailandTourism,0,1.0,False

A bit about me: 

	•	I’m majoring in Economics 

	•	I’m very clean and organized, and I’d really appreciate a roommate who’s also organized and respectful of shared space

	•	I’m a little shy and introverted at first, but I open up once I connect with someone

	•	I love running, swimming, reading, grabbing coffee, going on walks, having deep conversations, watching movies, and watching F1

	•	I’m totally down to explore campus, try new things, and hang out whether it’s studying together, late-night walks, or just chilling in the dorm

	•	I’d love to get along with my roommate and make the dorm a fun, friendly, and comfortable space

I’m also really looking forward to making friends and would love to connect with someone I can vibe with both as a roommate and a friend!

* Are there ways to **improve the accuracy or stability** of the GNSS output like using gg map in smartphone?
* Have any of you worked on GPS-based projects and can share your experience or tips?

My family and friends are great and understand me well, so I don't often get into situations where a meltdown is likely. I think I might have experienced one recently, though, and I'm interested to hear what y'all's are like and if this sounds similar or not.

I've been putting myself in a lot of unfamiliar situations in a row in an effort to challenge myself--volunteering in a public-facing role at a food pantry, going to a new gym, getting an X-ray at a new doctor's office, getting coffee with a stranger, meeting up with high school acquaintances, speaking my second language, etc. None of it went badly, but I could feel myself losing energy over the course of it all.

After a few days of this, I got left alone in the food pantry and was responsible for pretty much everything that was happening in there, even though I had never held the specific role I was in. I made a few mistakes--nothing major, but I was beginning to get stressed. Then, I was helping a man load a pallet of cans into his car and accidentally scratched it a bit. He got upset, the cold kind of upset where he went all quiet but was visibly angry. I offered to pay him for it but he said something along the lines of ""you've done enough"" & got in his car.

I just barely made it back into the building before I completely lost control. I started crying uncontrollably while trying to tell my supervisor what happened, and then I couldn't breathe, I was gasping for air. I locked myself in the bathroom and curled up in a ball on the ground for 10-15 minutes trying to control my breathing, but even once I stopped crying I still couldn't breathe right--that took probably another 15 minutes.

Once I calmed down, I finished volunteering (this time solo tasks, no people involved) and left. I tried to go to the gym but I just could not get the energy up to do it. I pretty much stayed in bed with headphones on the rest of the day, and was a bit ""snappy"" if anyone tried to interact with me.

Looking back, it seems like such a small thing that probably shouldn't have completely ruined my day or caused such a strong reaction.

What are y'all's like? How do you tell the difference between being emotional and ASD-related meltdowns?",9,1747577708.0,aspergirls,5,1.0,False
