I(28) am dating Steven(29). We have been dating for about 2 years and this christmas he decided he wanted to visit his family. I was less enthusiastic, I hate flying and his family lives across the country. I suggested we stay with my family again but he insisted.  I agreed and he bought our tickets. He must have bought the earliest tickets possible because our flight left at 7 am. He wanted to be there way too early but I knew he was just being paranoid. I do admit i maybe dragged my feet out of the house a little bit but we got to the airport at 630. Security was super fast so I figured I had time to stop at starbucks to get some coffee. He was very pushy and said we didnt have time but I figured he was just paranoid. I dragged him to the line with me and got my coffee. He was basically giving me the silent treatment as we walked to out gate. And I learned it was because the plane had already been boarded and we missed our flight. I tried to make a joke like "" the universe didnt want us to go to your parents place lol"" but he just started freaking out. He told me that he couldnt deal with my ""immaturity"" (hes only one year older than me) and told me thqt we were over. He apparently had booked another ticket for himself but not one for me.  I asked him what I was supposed to do and he told me to take an uber home and then he just left me at the gate. Ive been texting him nonstop and he just wont respond. Im worried that his parents have started gaslighting him to break up with me. I think that yeah maybe I shouldnt have gotten the coffee but hes being such a dick about the whole thing.

1q295a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q295a2/how_to_choose_smart_plugs_for_home_offices/,How to choose smart plugs for home offices?,"Setting up a productive home office means getting your tech setup right, and smart plugs can make a huge difference in how you manage your workspace. These little devices let you control electronics remotely and automate your daily routine.

**What Makes a Good Smart Plug for Your Office?**

When shopping for smart plugs, you want ones that work reliably with your WiFi network. Look for models that connect easily to your home's internet without constant drops. The best smart plugs support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, giving you more connection options.

App quality matters too. You'll be using the smartphone app daily to control your devices, so make sure it has good reviews and regular updates. Some apps let you set schedules, monitor energy usage, and group multiple plugs together.

**Key Features to Consider**

Voice control compatibility is a game-changer for home offices. You can turn devices on or off without stopping your work. Most quality smart plugs work with Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit.

Energy monitoring helps you track which office equipment uses the most power. This feature can help lower your electricity bill by showing you exactly what's drawing energy throughout the day.

Timer functions let you automate your workspace routine. Set your coffee maker to start brewing before your workday begins, or have your desk lamp turn on automatically at sunset.

**Safety and Reliability**

Choose smart plugs with proper safety certifications like FCC and ETL listing. These certifications mean the device meets safety standards for home use. Overload protection prevents damage if you accidentally plug in something that draws too much power.

The physical design should fit your outlet setup. Some smart plugs are bulky and block neighboring outlets, which can be frustrating in a home office where outlet space is limited.

**Making Your Choice**

Smart plugs typically cost between $10-25 each, depending on features. Basic models handle simple on/off control, while premium versions include energy monitoring and advanced scheduling options.

Before buying, check what smart home ecosystem you already use. If you have Alexa devices, prioritize plugs that work seamlessly with Amazon's platform.

You can find a wide selection of reliable smart plugs that meet these criteria by checking out [quality options available here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs). Reading customer reviews helps you understand real-world performance before making your decision.

**Getting Started**

Most smart plugs take less than 10 minutes to set up. Download the manufacturer's app, plug in the device, and follow the pairing instructions. Start with one or two plugs to test compatibility with your home network before expanding your setup.

Remember that smart plugs work best with devices that have physical power buttons or turn on automatically when they receive power. Items like desk fans, lamps, and coffee makers are perfect candidates for smart plug control.

Smart plugs transform your home office from a basic workspace into an automated, efficient environment. The right smart plugs make your daily routine smoother while giving you better control over your office equipment and energy usage.",1,1767384561.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False

I mean, It was so high that I just knew something was wrong. So, I decided to do research to try and figure out what was going on and guess what I found out?

**Over 93% of small business owners and freelancers overpay in taxes every single year.**

93%. Every year. Thats insane but whats even more insane is the reason why we’re all overpaying: we’re not tracking write-offs correctly.

At first, I wasn’t tracking them at all, which Is why my bill was so high, so I decided to start tracking. I began by looking up the best methods to do so, and I was between these two options:

1. Saving receipts and logging them into a spreadsheet 

2. Paying a premium for software that has a ton of features that I don’t actually need.

Both options seemed miserable. Im not consistent enough to save and log every single receipt and Im not trying to pay a premium just to track my own spending.

But taxes are taxes and even though I don’t really gaf about them, they’re important so I came up with my own solution.

I built an app called Deduct AI. It scans your transactions, flags every expense you can write off, categorizes them, tells you what additional information you need to add in order to properly claim the expense, then you can easily export a IRS compliant expense report. 

In 3 minutes, it scanned my transactions from 2025 and found $13,459 worth of write-offs. All I had to do was tap one button. 

To test it, I ran ads across tiktok and its already found more than $120k in deductions for small businesses and freelancers. Its help entrepreneurs discover purchases that can be written off for their business, and most have reported that the app helped them save more in deductions compared to when they tracked them themselves by saving receipts (and it took far less time).

SO, if you’re in this subreddit, you’re an entrepreneur like me thats likely overpaying in taxes. To solve this problem, all you need is a simple and quick solution at a fraction of the cost to lower your tax bill by thousands. Download Deduct AI. You’ll pay less taxes and never have to worry about this problem again. Theres a free trial available for a limited time, then its only $6 a month. Same price as a cup of coffee.

1q293nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1q293nb/why_some_people_speak_loudly_psychology_explains/,Why Some People Speak Loudly: Psychology Explains,"We have all encountered that one person in a quiet coffee shop or a library whose voice seems to carry across the entire room. While it can be jarring, psychology suggests that ""loud talking"" is rarely a simple act of rudeness. Instead, it is a complex cocktail of biological triggers, personality traits, and environmental conditioning.

Understanding why some people have a higher baseline volume can help us navigate social interactions with more empathy and less frustration.

# 1. The Lombard Effect: A Biological Reflex

One of the most common reasons for increased volume is the **Lombard Effect**. This is an involuntary psychological and physiological response where speakers increase their vocal effort in the presence of background noise to enhance the clarity of their communication.

As explored in the **2011 study ""The Lombard effect""** by **Sue Anne Zollinger and Henrik Brumm**, published in **Current Biology**, this phenomenon isn't just about being heard; it's a fundamental shift in how we process our own voice. When we cannot hear our own feedback loop clearly, our brain automatically ""cranks up"" the output.

# 2. Personality Markers and Extroversion

Psychology has long linked vocal characteristics to specific personality types. People who score high in **extroversion** and **dominance** tend to speak louder because their internal ""arousal"" levels are higher, and they are naturally more comfortable taking up social space.

* **Social Presence:** Loud talkers often use volume to command attention or establish leadership within a group.
* **Arousal Levels:** Extroverts often require more external stimulation, which can manifest as more energetic, high-volume speech.

In the **1976 study ""The Relationship Between Speaker Tone of Voice and Personality Perception""** by **Charles D. Aronovitch**, published in the **Journal of Social Psychology**, research indicated that listeners consistently associate higher volume with higher levels of extroversion and self-confidence, even if the speaker isn't consciously trying to project those traits.

# 3. The ""Sounds of Narcissism""

While many loud talkers are simply enthusiastic, psychology also looks at the ""Dark Triad"" of personality traits—specifically narcissism. For some, a loud voice is a tool for **social magnetism** or a way to ensure they remain the center of attention.

>

This was examined in the **2010 study ""The sounds of narcissism: Physical attractiveness, social magnetism, and the vocal expression of narcissism""** by **Nicholas S. Holtzman, Simine Vazire, and Matthias R. Mehl**, published in the **Journal of Research in Personality**. The study found that narcissism was positively correlated with more frequent and louder speech, as these individuals tend to be more ""socially expansive.""

# 4. Cultural and Environmental Conditioning

Sometimes, the psychology of a loud voice is rooted in childhood development. If a person grew up in a large, boisterous household, they may have learned that the only way to be heard or acknowledged was to speak over others.

* **Baseline Volume:** Every individual has a ""vocal set point"" developed in youth.
* **Cultural Norms:** Certain cultures value high-energy, high-volume communication as a sign of honesty and engagement, whereas others view it as aggressive.

# 5. The Physical Reality: Hearing Loss

It is important to consider that ""psychological"" loud talking can sometimes be a compensation for physical decline. **Presbycusis** (age-related hearing loss) often causes individuals to lose the ability to monitor their own volume. When they can’t hear themselves, they assume others can’t hear them either, leading to a permanent increase in their speaking ""floor.""

# Summary Table: Why We Speak Loudly

|**Factor**|**Description**|**Psychological Driver**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Lombard Effect**|Response to background noise|Communication survival|
|**Extroversion**|High energy/social comfort|Search for stimulation|
|**Narcissism**|Dominating the ""auditory space""|Need for validation/control|
|**Upbringing**|Learned behavior from family|Seeking attention/recognition|

Speaking loudly is rarely a choice made to annoy others. Whether it’s a reflex to noise, a trait of an outgoing personality, or a learned behavior from a crowded childhood home, our volume says a lot about our inner world.",1,1767384458.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

I took over managing their care; fast forward a year later, I ended up with diagnoses for all four kids (ages 3-8) that went ""missed""; all four special needs, two autistic, a genetic mutation, adhd, anxiety; developmental delays, the whole nine. Two SSIs approved, two pending (the two with the most severe issues are pending, IMO). 

I gave up my career, but I wanted to switch careers anyways to something more asynchronous because it left me driving around a ton. I lost every dime I'd ever made to my ex essentially stealing it behind my back and either hiding it or blowing it. I'm starting over at 40. Live with family, but need my own place within a year or two. I want to work part-time, but it's incredibly hard finding said work. Jobs are either AI spam scam, want senior or mid level, are dying due to AI automation or are full-time entry level in person jobs that I'd likely be fired from within the first week due to the immense amount of therapy, sick days and other demands that come with having special needs kids. I can't compete with a 22 year old fresh out of college who can go on 4 hours sleep and coffee, pumping out 10 hour days. 

  
I love the babies dearly and am SO grateful for the SSI, because I don't know what to do. I'm open to any ideas. I have 15+ years experience reviewing investigative documentation, preparing reports and interviewing, with some basic understanding of SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

  
Do I keep grinding the software stuff behind the scenes while I live off the SSIs? Is it even worth it due to AI taking over? Do I go back for ABA therapy licensing myself, or would it be too much emotional demand since I deal with it at home? 

  
I'm ranting now - but open to any ideas.

A week ago I (28F) asked my mother if her and I could have coffee or breakfast together, just the two of us. I was under a lot of stress from my career and wanted someone to talk to. I specifically asked her to please not tell my sister so my sister wouldn't feel left out and assured her we wouldn't take long. My sister goes out with her almost every weekend without inviting me so I really thought this would be fine for her to do.

**TLDR Background context:** Sister and I do not communicate. **Background context on family dynamic:** I live at home with my mom, dad, older sister (33F) and grandparent (rent is very expensive where I live + cultural factors). I have been no communication with my older sister since she re-directed anger she had with someone else in the house at me by throw a body-length mirror on me. Long story short, she is a sweetheart when everything goes her way and physically violent and emotionally abusive when things do not. My parents refuse to discipline her and enable her behaviour, I think because a few of her past outbursts have really scared them and they just want peace. Seeing her needs prioritized at my expense deeply hurts me but I've accepted for the most part that it's a complex situation and I can't change how they deal with it/hurt too 

  
**Ok back to the story**

My mom ends up telling my sister that I want to go out and I see her sitting in the front seat of the car with my mom when I come downstairs. ""But she wanted to come! I felt bad"" is what my mom whispers when I pull her to the side and confront her. I did not go out with them. The next week, I spent it mostly in my room, head-down, focusing on tackling my career stress and pretty hurt. I did not speak to my mom and she did not reach out to me either. I felt a shift in both my parents; they would always have their back towards me when we were in the same room, no hello/bye, no reaching out. On NYE, they all (everyone but me) sat together downstairs and had lunch - I only found out as I was leaving my room to go to the washroom and heard the chatter downstairs. Nobody had told me.

On New Year's, I stayed in my room until afternoon and then went to take a shower. I did not run to them in the early morning and wish them a Happy New Year, which I usually do. After my shower, I look out my bedroom window and noticed they had all dressed up and were in the car going for dinner. I was not given a heads up or invited. I spent New Year's alone. I went for a drive to make myself feel better, got pulled over (completely my fault - my plate was expired), called my family panicked to send me a photo of my documents. When I got home half an hour later, they were all sleeping. 

  
I confronted my mom today. This is her response.

1. She felt bad about my sister including herself in the attempted coffee chat a week ago and ""there was nothing \[she\] could do"" because my sister wanted to join.

2. Nobody talked to me the last week because I was stressed and they didn't want to stress me out further because they didn't want it to affect my performance with my career issue.

3. I didn't need to be ""invited"" to the lunch on NYE because it was my house. (I agree with this. I don't need special treatment, but if it were me, and a person is missing from the table, I'd go check on them to make sure they knew we were all eating together since we rarely do)

4. They went out on New Year's without me because I wasn't talking to THEM and they thought I wouldn't want to come.

5. They were all concerned I got pulled over but didn't want to upset me further so they didn't check in.

I told her she is selfish- that she takes the easy way instead of the right way because it makes her feel like a good person with the least amount of work. I told her that nobody talking to me was not for my sake but it was punishment that I dared get upset and stand up for myself; if it was for my sake, they would have at least checked in. She said ""I guess I'm a horrible mom!"" and I said ""This is not about you. But yes, you are awful"". 

  
Yes, I am generally a sensitive person. However, I am deeply sad about this scenario; spending New Year's alone despite all my mental efforts for my family and being told that I'm imagining things/ inflicted it on myself makes me feel so sad that I feel empty. I do not yell, I have never been violent (I actually hate loud noises, conflict, and violence) so the whole ""we wanted to leave you alone so you wouldn't be upset"" makes me feel like I am a monster and don't know it.

1q292yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q292yn/aio_in_this_situation/,AIO in this situation?,"I’m a 25M and she’s a 26F. We’ve been together for about a year. This is my first time posting something like this, so apologies in advance if the narration isn’t perfect—I’m genuinely looking for advice.

Before we got together, she had two previous relationships, both about a year long. In her most recent one, she told me she was physically assaulted by her ex. At the time, I didn’t know her personally, but I used to see them at the gym kissing and holding hands even after that incident. She later said she stayed close to him out of fear that he might hit her again. From an outside perspective, though, she seemed happy around him.

Fast forward to when we met. Her best friend approached me at the gym and asked for my number on her behalf. I’ll call my girlfriend “G” and her best friend “C.”

G and I started talking, going on late-night drives, hanging out, and things felt easy and fun at first. During this time, I learned that C hated me because of my immigration status. For context, I was (and still am) a valid student in the U.S. on a legal visa. C was openly racist toward me because of where I’m from. Whenever this happened, G would say that C “wasn’t really like that” or that she’d change, but she never firmly stood up for me.

C’s behavior was concerning in general. She would go on dates, and if she liked someone, she would AirTag their car and follow them without their knowledge. That alone made me very uncomfortable.

Once G and I officially started dating, things got worse. C began fighting with G constantly and told her she had to choose between me and her, or that G had to prioritize her time before spending time with me. This went on for around five months. During that same period, G is an extremely emotional person she would fight with C and then she would fight with me.

G and I were fighting almost every single day over small things—why I wasn’t posting her on social media, or some other issue.

Around this time, G moved in with me without directly asking. I’d wake up to fights and go to sleep after fights. It became constant. Another important detail is that we come from different religions. Because of that, I couldn’t immediately introduce her to my mom. I was slowly preparing my mom so it wouldn’t become a big issue, which eventually worked—but G kept pushing to talk to my mom immediately, even knowing it could cause problems.

Eventually, the fights between G and C calmed down, but they remained best friends(I didn’t want her friendship to end so I didn’t insist to choose anyone ), and C continued to dislike me and make comments about my visa status. G continued defending her. The fighting between G and me never really stopped, and here we are one year later.

Now, my mistake: after months of nonstop conflict, I was snapping another girl on Snapchat for about four days. The snaps were just random pictures of my room or scenery—similar to what I send my male friends to stay in touch. One day she sent me a selfie, and I replied that she looked good using a cheesy movie line. I immediately felt bad, deleted the entire chat, and stopped talking to her.

Later, my girlfriend found out while checking my phone (which she did frequently). She said I cheated on her. That same night, she told all my friends before even talking to me about it. I later found out that she had been talking badly about me to people—including my roommates—behind my back for a long time, often turning them against me and then telling me a completely different story.

After that incident, I apologized repeatedly. She even made me apologize to some friends and her cousin, saying that I had cheated on them as well. I did it, but I was confused about why so many people were involved in our relationship, especially since I had never spoken to anyone about our issues out of respect for privacy.

From that point on, she would randomly cry saying she “remembered it again,” accuse me of cheating constantly, and get jealous even if a female coworker spoke to me. ( I don’t have any female friends just 1 friend like a sister and she didn’t even like that) She needed reassurance almost daily and wanted control over everything.

For the entire year she lived with me, she didn’t help around the house. I cleaned, did laundry (including folding her clothes), dropped her off in the mornings, picked her up in the evenings, planned meals around her, and paid for everything when we went out. Despite this, she claimed I never loved her or showed enough physical affection. She pushed hard for PDA, which I struggled with because I’m introverted and grew up in a conservative family. I tried to compensate in other ways, but she mainly wanted people to see that we were together.

Early on, whenever we traveled, we’d spend hours arguing because I wouldn’t post her on Instagram. My family follows me, and hiding/unhiding stories was stressful, so I suggested posting her on Close Friends instead. That wasn’t enough for her.

Over time, I became completely drained and felt like I lost myself.

To make things worse, there was a guy staying with us temporarily while job hunting. He and my girlfriend fought twice, and I had to step in both times. Neither of them paid rent. I eventually told both of them not to interact. In November, I told my girlfriend I couldn’t continue a live-in relationship and needed space to see if things improved. She completely lost it, packed her things (and some of mine), and left while spending the entire day talking badly about me to the same guy she had fought with.

She lived about 20 minutes away. She later came back to “reason things out,” but after that, she kept finding excuses to return—saying she couldn’t sleep without me, that she was having panic attacks, or that her family was forcing religion on her. Interestingly, she had no issues sleeping or functioning when she went on trips with friends.

She came back to stay for another week, during which I even bought her makeup because she needs it every morning and expects compliments daily after her makeup is done and I’ve always told her that she looks beautiful without makeup . I prefer minimal makeup, but that didn’t matter. I also used to get her Starbucks coffee almost every day because she said she couldn’t function without it—even though we had two coffee machines and multiple coffee options at home. She’d take two sips and throw the rest away every time, which honestly built a lot of resentment in me.

Recently, she fought again with that same guy. This time, he showed me messages where she had been talking badly about me. When I confronted her, she didn’t seem to care and instead warned him not to talk to either of us. The next morning, he told me even more things she had said about me. When I confronted her again, she completely flipped.

I tried to calm things down by talking to her in the car, telling her we could work through it together, but she refused to talk and insisted on going home. Once inside, she went straight to his room, humiliated him, kicked things around, threw his phone, and threatened to call the cops (her brother is a cop) to get him deported. He was crying and begging her to forgive him, saying he’d leave within a week, but she didn’t care and even told him to go to a homeless shelter. I had to physically step in multiple times to stop it. Watching that scared me, especially imagining what might happen if she ever behaved like that toward my family. He moved out a week later.

Later, on my birthday, I found out that after the Snapchat incident, she had told everyone before ever talking to me. She even created a group chat without me just to talk badly about me. On my birthday, she texted my roommate saying I only deserved the “bare minimum” because I cheated.

For context, I’ve always told her she’s free to leave if she wants to. When it was her birthday, she had a long list of expectations, and I met every single one. For my birthday, I told her not to spend money since she didn’t have a job—I just wanted to have dinner together. Despite that, she continues to complain about me to everyone.

There’s a lot more I could say, but even typing this out has left me exhausted. She’s extremely demanding, always wants things her way, presents herself as very sweet to others, but constantly talks badly behind my back. She’s very self-absorbed and always positions herself as the victim.

I genuinely don’t know if I’m overthinking or if this relationship is as unhealthy as it feels. I’d really appreciate outside perspective.",1,1767384415.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1q292pe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q292pe,Promises kept,"Super proud of myself for keeping my promise. I decided I wanted to do a 3 day water fast to start the new year fasted. I love fasting and do it for various reasons mainly health and religious reasons. Personally, I don’t experience true hunger during a fast, it might be my small frame, someone once said that my body might just conserve energy better than the average height human body. Really I just experience boredom because I’m not thinking about food and the meals I have to prepare. Regardless, fasting is still hard. You are still denying yourself one of life’s greatest pleasure, food. Fasting for me feels like a reset, a cleanse, and my body healing. It was so nice to commit to something I set out to do. I broke my fast with my usual breakfast egg whites with cheese and coffee, nothing fancy.

1q29284,https://i.redd.it/xr1nmlylszag1.jpeg,Great Shot has me Confused [Bambino Plus/Baratza ESP],"I just pulled a really great shot that has me confused.

I’m a newbie and I got this setup around 2 months ago. When I first got the setup I was only doing around 17g of coffee and grinding not super fine.  This was keeping the extraction time under the 30 second mark that I hear people saying is ideal. But I have been noticing my shots are little bit bitter and somewhat acidic/juicy tasting. 

On this last shot I ramped up to 20g and ground a lot finer (12 on the Baratza ESP). It was too much for the machine and nothing came out. But I pulled the shot again through the same puck and what came out actually tasted really good. 

So tried again. I kept my process the same (20g coffee, RDT, WDT, tamp to 30lbs, puck screen) except I ground more courses (15 instead of 12 on my grinder) and this time the shot did come out on the first pull but kind of strangely. It came out a little in the beginning, then stopped flowing, then started flowing again with a ton of crema, the most I have seen in one of my shots. I extracted it to 40g so 2:1 ratio and did about 8 seconds of pre infusion. I didn’t measure the total extraction time unfortunately, but it was definitely a lot longer than 30 seconds.

So this is what I’m confused about. This shot was so much smoother and creamier than any shot I have pulled before and there was almost no burnt flavor. But because the extraction was way longer than 30 seconds I had expected it would taste burnt. Also It was a lot more creamy and earthy tasting and not as juicy/acidic like a lot of the shots I have been pulling. 

Can anyone help me understand with such an extended extraction time why it wouldn’t taste burnt? And why there would be less juicy/acidic flavor with this pull? ",2,1767384367.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1q290py,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q290py/i_stumbled_into_a_fairy_tale_turns_out_it_wasnt/,"I stumbled into a fairy tale. Turns out, it wasn't the happily-ever-after kind.","I took up smoking last month. Why the hell not, at this point? What, exactly, was I trying to stay alive and healthy for?

That sounds dramatic, I know. But really, the fucking year I've had--if you'd been there, you'd understand.

It started with my mom dying last January. The only family I had left. She was only 56, in perfect health, but that doesn't matter when some asshole decides to drive himself home after one too many beers.

He walked away with just a couple scratches, by the way. So fucked up how that always seems to happen. He spent six months in jail, and now he's out on probation. I still can't get my head around it. How is that fair? What the fuck was that judge thinking?

I fell into a depressive fugue state after that. Slept all day, played video games all night, stopped talking to people. My boss extended me as much bereavement leave as he could, but eventually he fired me after I stopped showing up and answering his calls. Can't blame him, really.

My girlfriend put up with me longer than I probably deserved. I guess she figured it'd be pretty shitty to leave a guy for being sad his mom died. But it became too much, she said. Like the asshole I am, I refused to go to therapy like she asked. She said she couldn't help me if I wouldn't help myself, and she walked away. That was three months ago. Haven't heard from her since.

The unemployment checks stopped not long after that, so I had to take a much shittier job a few towns over and move into a perpetually damp basement apartment. My friends started drifting out of my life once I no longer lived close. Oh, and my car crapped out, so now I have to walk half an hour to the nearest bus stop before the sun comes up to get to work or the grocery store or literally anywhere else.

What else? I saw a mouse in my apartment a few days ago, and I'm sure there are more where that came from. My shower has mold creeping up the corners that no amount of bleach will get rid of. My boots keep letting water in, and I can't figure out where from or afford to replace them.

If I had a dog, I'm sure it would've run away by now.

Anyway, that's enough of my sob story. Suffice it to say, everything sucked. Every single day I got up and only did the stuff I needed to do to stay alive, and even that had started to feel pointless.

And that's where the cigarettes came in. They didn't exactly make me happy, but they dulled the pain enough that I just kept going.

One day I was sitting at my desk, bullshitting my way through some spreadsheet or something, I don't even remember. Susan--oh man, I forgot to tell you about her. She had this godawful high-pitched voice, the most grating laugh I've ever heard, and she did this obnoxious throat-clearing thing every ten seconds that made me want to smash her face in--no, you know what? Never mind. It doesn't matter.

So Susan was clearing her throat even more than usual and I'd forgotten my noise-cancelling headphones at home. Barry was whistling away at the desk next to mine. It was driving me up the wall, I felt like I was going to punch a hole right through my desk any second.

So I went out for a smoke break. Technically we weren't supposed to smoke at all on company property, so I went around back where there were no windows. I had to stand by the dumpsters, but it was better than walking all the way down the street to the park.

There was a patch of trees behind the building. Nothing much, just went back maybe a quarter mile until you got to the highway on the other side. I was standing there staring into it, not really thinking about anything, just trying to regain my cool before I went back inside.

As I was about to toss the cigarette and get back to work, I noticed something.

It hadn't been there before, I was sure of it. I'd never seen it on any of the dozens of smoke breaks I'd taken back there.

A trail. Why would anyone even put a trail back there? Who would want to hike in a sad patch of trees by the highway?

But there it was. The trees around it were bare, their leaves having fallen and started to rot on the ground weeks ago. But not on the trail. It was coated with a layer of yellow and orange leaves--golden bright, like they'd just fallen. A few still clung to the branches overhanging it.

I knew it was weird. A trail that shouldn't be there could not lead to anything good. But something about it drew me in. I can't really explain it, but I just felt like if I followed it I would find hope at the other end. I'd had so little of that the past year that I just couldn't make myself turn away.

So I followed it.

The leaves were just starting to turn crisp; they had that satisfying *crunch* when I stepped on them. As I walked, a few more leaves dropped gently from their branches and fluttered down to the ground.

The further I went, though, the fewer leaves were on the ground. More and more of them were in the trees, creating a golden canopy overhead.

I noticed then that I couldn't hear any cars. The noise should've been getting louder as I walked toward the highway, but it just wasn't there at all. No faint odor of exhaust, either.

I kept walking and walking and the leaves went from golden to a brilliant green. Some of the trees grew fruit or flowers. The bright colors, the birds singing, the sun shining gently through the trees--I know it sounds stupid, but I felt like I was walking through a fairy tale.

I don't know how long I walked. Long past the point where I should have encountered the highway, in any case. I knew I should turn around and go back, but I just couldn't. Wherever this trail was taking me, it had to be better than my life back there. I had to find the end of it.

Eventually, the trail opened up into a clearing. Wherever this was, it was far away from the freezing, wet, dying transition from fall into winter that I'd left behind.

Here, it was midspring. Morning. Soft golden light poured down from overhead. Dew coated each blade of grass. Birds sang, bugs hummed.

And in front of me was a house.

Not a log cabin or anything you'd expect to find deep in the woods. It was...cute. Colorful. A heavy wooden door was set into the clapboard walls. Intricately carved scrollwork ran along the roof, which was covered in multicolored tiles. Somehow, it worked--none of it clashed, it just...made sense.

In front of the house were ten or twelve garden beds, each overflowing with herbs and fruits and vegetables. As I got closer, I realized that none of the plants were familiar. I saw what I thought were little red and orange peppers, but they grew in a double helix shape, wrapping around themselves until they came to a fine point. There was a fruit that looked like a tomato from far away, but closer up I saw that it had burst open, its blue insides spilling out.

Some kind of herb grew next to it--tiny three-pointed leaves with little pink flowers growing out of the middle. I reached out a hand to touch it--

""Can I help you?""

I fell backward and scrambled away, looking around wildly for the speaker.

It was a woman in her 50s. She was wearing overalls and thick gardening gloves. Auburn haired streaked with silver poured over her shoulders.

She smiled down at me like I was an old friend she hadn't seen in awhile.

She pulled off her gloves and reached a hand down to help me up, and I took it. Her grasp was soft and gentle, but I felt an unexpected strength behind it when she hauled me to my feet.

""So,"" she said, ""what brings you to my neck of the woods?""

There was a slight southern twang to her voice, just like my mom had.

""I, uh,"" I stuttered. ""There was a trail and I just...walked.""

She gave a quick nod. ""There are a few ways to get here, but I think that way's my favorite. It's peaceful. Solitary.""

I nodded, despite my confusion. What other ways was she talking about?

""You got a name?""

""Oh! Yes,"" I said.

She raised her eyebrows. ""And that would be...""

""Nathan,"" I said. How had I forgotten to say it before?  Something about this woman's presence was throwing me off.

""Hello, Nathan. I'm Gwen. Welcome to my humble abode.""

Suddenly I realized that I shouldn't be here. I was trespassing. And I was ridiculously late getting back to work.

""I'm so sorry to intrude, I'll just get going,"" I said, turning around.

Gwen grasped my hand again. ""Nonsense. What kind of barbarian do you take me for? You're my guest, and you're welcome here. Come on inside and I'll get you something to eat.""

""I appreciate it, but I've really got to get back to--""

""I insist.""

She turned and walked toward the door and I followed. I wasn't ready to leave this place yet.

Inside, she sat me down at a long wooden dining table. The ground floor was a single room, small but cozy and inviting. Big armchairs piled with mismatched pillows and blankets, a big fireplace, stacks of old books along the walls. In the kitchen area, the shelves were crowded with jars full of herbs, dried mushrooms, and a bunch of things I didn't recognize. A huge cast-iron pot was boiling away on the ancient-looking stove. It was a lot like the one my grandma had when she was alive.

Gwen set a mug of tea down in front of me. It didn't smell like regular tea, like Lipton or whatever. It was somehow sweet and savory at the same time. I could see some tea leaves still floating around at the bottom, plus some of those tiny pink flowers.

""Well, go on,"" said Gwen impatiently. ""Drink!""

I raised the mug to my lips and took a sip.

Instantly I felt the tension go out of me, a calm settle over my mind. I'd been walking around angry all this time, and now it was like I was incapable of feeling anger. I could hardly even remember what it felt like.

She pushed a tray of cookies toward me and I didn't hesitate. I gobbled up so many so fast without thinking. By the time I stopped, I was pretty mortified by how I must look to her.

But she just gave me that warm smile again, like she couldn't be happier I was enjoying her food.

And holy shit, was I enjoying it. I don't know what was in those cookies, but they were the most delicious I've ever had. Sugary sweet, but not cloying. They made me feel full in a way I hadn't for a long time. Not I-ate-too-much-and-now-I'm-dying full, but full in my soul. That makes me sound like an asshole, but it's true. Mom dying had hollowed me out, and I'd been desperately trying to fill that hole with rage and despair, but instead of filling me up it just made me hungrier.

Now it was like I was whole again. And until that moment, I hadn't realized how empty I felt before.

To my horror, I felt myself start to cry.

""S-sorry,"" I said, looking down and trying to wipe my face clean, but the tears kept coming. ""I don't know why--""

""I think you do,"" said Gwen. ""Don't you want to let it out?""

I did. I really, really did.

And once I started talking, I couldn't stop. I told her about thoughts and feelings I wouldn't have dreamed of telling anyone else--if I'd had anyone else to tell them to. But it felt safe to do this here. I told her everything, about the dark place I'd been in since Mom died and then Alyssa left, the way my life had fallen apart. I even told her about Susan and her goddamn throat thing.

By the end of this speech, my heart was racing and I was breathing hard.

Gwen just watched me for a while.

""Sounds like you've been through an awful lot,"" she finally said.

""Yeah, I guess so.""

""And how much of it, exactly, do you think was caused by your self-pity?""

I started at that, sloshing lukewarm tea down my chin. ""W-what?""

""Because I'd say almost all of it.""

I was stunned at this sudden turn. She'd been nothing but warm and supportive until now. ""I--my mom--""

""What happened to your mother was awful. A tragedy. And the depression, well--that was bound to happen. But everything after that? Sounds like you just sat back and watched it happen. Left your life up to the fates, and any old thing that tried to claw its way into your heart while you were walking around empty.""

""What was I supposed to do?""

""Your girlfriend handed you the answer on a silver platter. You let her walk away anyway.""

""I didn't really think she'd leave over it.""

""And after she left--did you start therapy then?""

""I didn't see the point. She was already gone.""

""The point is that if you'd gone, you might not be living in your run-down apartment and working a job you hate. Maybe you'd have a few new friends by now, or a new lady in your life.""

I felt like I should be angry, but I wasn't. Mostly I just felt sad. Guilty. Because she was right.

""I should have, I guess.""

""Mhmm. And if you know that, why aren't you going now?""

""Can't afford it. My job has shitty insurance.""

""Well, I've got some good news for you,"" she said with a grin. ""Talking to me is free. And you're welcome back here any time.""

""You're a therapist?""

She laughed hard at that. ""Oh, honey, no. But I do make an incredible brown butter pumpkin pie, and that's almost as good.""

My spirits started to rise again. ""That's my favorite.""

""Mine too.""

There was a long silence.

Then I said, ""I don't even know where to start.""

""You start small,"" Gwen said gently. ""If you set out to fix it all at once, you'll get overwhelmed and fail. Pick one thing that feels doable, and make a change. It could be anything.""

I nodded, now lost in thought, sifting through all the things that were wrong in my life and what I could do about them. There were so many, it was hard to choose.

I started to reach for another cookie, but suddenly became aware of how much time I'd passed there. ""Oh no, oh shit. Sorry!"" I said as she raised her eyebrows at my foul language. ""I just--I should've been back at work like two hours ago. I can't lose this job.""

""I wouldn't worry,"" said Gwen. ""I've got a feeling you'll make it back alright. Come with me, I'll show you a shortcut.""

We went back outside toward the tree line and Gwen pointed vaguely into the trees, told me to follow the path, that I couldn't miss it.

But I couldn't see a path. I turned around to ask her to point it out again, but she was gone, like she'd just vanished from the spot.

I took a few steps into the trees, figuring the path might be more obvious once I was inside.

It wasn't. In fact, it was so dark in there I could hardly see anything at all. I tried to go back, but the clearing was gone. It got darker and darker with every step I took.

And then, just as panic was about to set in--

I was sitting at my desk. The spreadsheet I'd been working on was open in front of me. Barry was whistling the exact same tune as when I'd left for my smoke break.

Had I fallen asleep? Had it all been a weird dream?

As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I knew it wasn't true. I still had that full feeling from the tea and cookies. There were even a couple of stray crumbs on the collar of my shirt.

I checked the time. Only ten minutes had passed since I'd stepped outside to smoke. How could that be right?

""Uh, hey, Barry? I have kind of a weird question,"" I said.

Barry stopped whistling and looked up from the crossword puzzle he'd been working on. ""Hmm?""

""How long was I away from my desk?""

Barry's forehead scrunched up in confusion. ""Oh, I dunno. Ten, fifteen minutes. Like usual.""

""And...how long ago did I get back to my seat?""

Now he was starting to look genuinely worried about me. ""Just now, maybe thirty seconds ago. Do you not remember?""

""Don't worry about it,"" I said. ""It's just been a weird day.""

""If you say so."" He went back to his puzzle, but I sensed that he was watching me out of the corner of his eye.

I tried to go over the events of that morning again in my mind, but it was making my head spin. Nothing that happened made any sense. I was starting to realize how stupid I had been to just wander down a random path to a place that physically could not have existed.

I needed something else to focus on.

Nothing to do at my desk but work, so I got back to it.

It was weird--never in my life had I worked that hard for that long. The work was still boring and kinda pointless, but I just...kept going. Every time I felt like stopping, like this was stupid and I'd rather be doing anything else, something in me just powered through. Yeah, it was bullshit, but I was never going to get anywhere better by slacking off. Stupid, pointless tasks are the key to success, I guess.

By the time I had finished, it was well past dark. Most of the offices had their lights off, and only a few people were still milling around. I looked at my phone--5:46 PM.

""Fucking fuck,"" I mumbled.

""Something the matter?"" asked Barry. He had stood up and was pulling his coat on.

""I missed my bus,"" I said. ""My options are wait an hour for the next one or spend half of this day's pay on an Uber.""

""I've got a third option for you,"" said Barry. ""I can give you a ride.""

I stared at him, surprised. ""Are you sure? I don't want you to go out of your way.""

""How do you know you're out of my way?""

""I live in Grantwood. It's out of everyone's way.""

Barry chuckled. ""Well, I don't mind. I like driving around, and I don't get out that way much.""

""Well...okay. If you *really* don't mind.""

""Hurry up, or I'm leaving without you,"" Barry said. But then he laughed and waited for me by the door while I packed up.

The drive wasn't nearly as awkward as I expected. Barry's music was bad and the car smelled kind of funky, but at least he knew when to talk and when to just let the silence be. A lot of the people who take my bus could learn a thing or two from Barry.

By the time he dropped me off, I felt much lighter than I usually do after work. Normally I just want to eat a frozen pizza and go to bed, but I felt like maybe tonight I'd actually cook, and maybe read a book or something.

My mood soured as soon as I opened my apartment door and the damp smell washed over me. Back to reality, I guess.

Still, I at least made myself a sandwich instead of a frozen meal. I even put some vegetables on it.

The next morning, it was back to the bus. I could feel the misery starting to creep back in.

I tried to shake it off as I walked into the office, to have a positive outlook, but I swear to god the instant I walked past Susan's desk and she did that throat-clearing thing again, it just shattered my will to have a good day.

That place fucking sucked, there was no way around it.

Barry smiled and greeted me as I approached my desk, but I barely managed a terse ""Hey"" before I sank into my seat and switched my computer on. Barry looked taken aback but didn't say anything, just went back to work. I felt a twinge of guilt at that, but not enough to apologize.

I spent maybe an hour working on another pointless task before I couldn't stand Susan anymore. I got up and basically half-ran to the bathroom just so I could have some peace and quiet for a few minutes. Get my thoughts in order.

I yanked open the door and by the time I realized there was a dark, empty void in front of me I had already stepped through and started falling.

I don't know how long I fell, exactly. It was probably just a few seconds, but it felt like longer. Like months or even years.

I landed, hard, on a wooden floor. Groaning, I pushed myself up to a sitting position so I could look around.

The cottage. I was back.

""Hello there,"" said Gwen. She was crouched down, loading something into the oven. ""You find another way here? What was it?""

""Uh...some kind of void?"" I rose slowly to my feet.

Gwen slammed the oven shut and stood. ""Ah. That one takes some getting used to. It's alright after a while, though. Once you learn how to land on your feet.""

""How did I...I didn't do this on purpose this time.""

""After you make it here the first time, it gets easier. You don't have to decide to do it--you just have to want it.""

It wasn't making a lot of sense to me, but then again I was still recovering from the fall.

""I'd ask how you've been, but the fact that you're back tells me the answer is 'not so great.'""

""Yeah, that about covers it.""

""What's troubling you?""

I sat down at the table, and Gwen was already placing another cup of tea in front of me. It was sweet this time. Like apples with cinnamon.

""I think I might be broken.""

Gwen raised her eyebrows.

""Whatever you did to help me last time, it didn't last. I had an okay afternoon, things were starting to look up, just a little. But one little thing goes wrong and I just lose it.""

""There's that self-pity again. Things just happen to you. What did you *do* about it?""

I shrugged.

""That's what I thought.""

""What can I do? Where do I start?""

Gwen smiled, and for the first time I felt unsettled in her presence, like I had walked into a trap. The warm, welcoming smile was gone, replaced by a wicked grin. Her face was harsh, all sharp angles and shadows.

I leaned away from her, unnerved.

Suddenly her face softened, settling back into its usual cheerful expression. She slid a plate of pastries across to me. I took one and bit into it. A sense of ease washed over me, erasing my fear.

""You've got to get to the root of your problems. Dig deep.""

""This all started with my mom dying. I can't bring her back.""

""No. You can't. But there are other things you could try.""

""Like what?""

""Oh, you'll think of something. All done?""

I nodded as I shoved the last bit of the pastry into my mouth.

""Good. It's time for you to go.""

""What? I--""

But I was already gone. The room fell away and I was in the void again.

Next thing I knew, I was crashing to the bathroom floor, landing hard on my hands and knees. I took a minute to scan under the stalls; no one was in there. So that was something, at least.

Still in a daze, I brushed myself off and made my way back to my desk. I blazed through my work like the day before, but it was different this time. Instead of feeling energized, it was like I was in a fog, like I wasn't really thinking, just doing. I was barely even aware of what I was typing.

A couple of hours had passed by the time I was jolted out of this state by someone standing in front of me, talking.

With sudden dread, I realized it was my boss. Probably chewing me out for something or other, I'd missed everything he'd said so far.

But now that I was finally tuning in, I realized it wasn't that. The opposite, actually. He was praising my work from the day before, saying if I kept it up I'd be looking at a raise in six months, maybe a promotion in a year.

I nodded and thanked him before he walked away, but I couldn't really absorb what had happened. Partly because of the fog settling back in, but also because I'd never been the kind of person who got raises, and especially not promotions. Before my mom died, I'd just kind of floated from job to job, doing well enough not to get fired but never enough to stand out. That was the way I liked it. That's what I told myself, anyway.

I kept working in that fog until I noticed Barry talking to me, offering a ride again.

The whole way home, I could hear Barry talking, trying to make conversation, but the fog was just getting worse and I barely understood him. I just nodded along and smiled now and then and hoped he wouldn't notice how out of it I was.

By the time he dropped me off, I was basically falling asleep. I gave him a slurred goodbye and stumbled to my apartment, not sure I was going to make it until I was sliding the key into the lock.

I didn't even bother to eat, just crashed on my bed and was out instantly.

The next morning I was somehow even more tired, despite the ten hours of sleep. I felt heavy, like I was sinking down into the earth.

Somehow, I made it to work. I'm not normally a coffee person but I was mainlining the breakroom sludge that day. I added a lot of sugar to mask the taste, but it actually made it worse.

Slowly, the caffeine brought me back to my senses. Then I realized the heaviness I'd been feeling was pain. My muscles--all of them, but especially my arms and shoulders--were aching like I'd spent the whole night lifting weights instead of sleeping. I was pretty sure I had bruises too, all over, but I wasn't about to check in the middle of the office and the thought of going back into that bathroom made me nauseous.

I took so many smoke breaks that day, hoping the path would appear to me again and that Gwen would have some kind of tea or cake or whatever to ease the pain, but nothing. I was almost tempted to try the bathroom void again but couldn't bring myself to do it.

By the time 5:30 rolled around, I was desperate to be anywhere but there. Even my crappy apartment.

As I waited for Barry to finish up the last of his tasks, I switched my phone back on.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks.

First: nine texts from a friend I hadn't spoken to in months.

Next: the content of those texts.

It was about the driver who killed my mom. He was missing, and there were signs of a disturbance at his house. Despite hours of searching, the cops had no idea where he'd gone or who might be responsible.

I just sat there, numb. It was weird. I felt like I should be happy, or at least relieved, that this guy may have finally faced justice in some form. I should've felt *something*, right?

But I was just blank, for a long time.

As Barry drove me home, a feeling did start to form, just not one that I expected.

Dread. It started out as just an itch in the back of my head, but it expanded and expanded until I was full with it. Until I wanted to punch the hell out of Barry's radio just to make his shitty Christian rock stop. I wanted to scream at him, ask him what that fucking smell was, why did this goddamn car always smell faintly of BO, like he hadn't showered in three days. How could it ALWAYS smell like he hadn't showered in three days?

I made it home, barely. And I didn't sleep. I tossed around, got tangled up in my blankets, until I realized I wasn't in my bed anymore. I was cold, and damp, under a thick layer of rotting leaves, gnarled tree roots digging into my back.

It was too dark to see much, but I knew where I was.

I knew the clearing couldn't be far.

""Gwen?"" I called out.

The response was a soft skitter of laughter from behind me, just over my shoulder.

I whipped around, but no one was there.

""Where are you? What's happening?""

More laughter, this time I couldn't tell from where. It was behind me, then over my head, then far off, then inside my head.

I stumbled to my feet, branches scraping at me, tearing at my skin. The laughter had stopped. Now it was a whispering, from all around, just soft enough that I couldn't hear the words.

It was so dark I couldn't see more than two or three feet in front of my face. But I had to get out of there, so I took a cautious step forward--

\*\*\*

And I was stumbling off the bus in front of my office. I stood there in shock for a minute before the cold started to eat at me, and then I rushed inside.

I looked down. Somehow, I had gotten dressed. The clothes were rumpled and a couple shirt buttons were undone, and I had no coat, but at least I hadn't shown up in my underwear. I straightened myself up as best I could and tried to walk into the office like everything was normal.

Susan gasped when she saw me. It was the least annoying sound she'd ever made. ""What *happened*?""

I caught sight of my reflection in the window behind her desk. My clothes were mostly fine, but my face was scratched up and blotchy with dirt.

""I, uh...a cat?""

""A cat?"" Susan stared at me, her mouth hanging open ever so slightly.

""An angry cat,"" I said, pissed at myself for not coming up with a better lie.

""You were attacked by an angry cat."" She stared at me like I had just said something unimaginably stupid, which I guess I had. But I couldn't take it back now.

""Yes. I need to go clean up.""

I left before she could say anything else.

I paused outside of the bathroom for a second before I shoved my way through the door.

My face was a mess, and my hands weren't much better. I washed up as much as I could, but the scrapes still looked pretty gnarly. It was bad enough that I considered taking a sick day, but I only got five of those a year. Plus, I was already there. And I had no desire to spend more time in my crappy apartment which was also now apparently a portal to hell.

So I went back to my desk and kept my face pointed directly at the computer screen.

Barry tried to talk to me a few times, but I brushed him off. It would be the bus that night for me, I guessed.

The fog was back, and I was struggling to pay attention to anything happening around me. I never got up from my desk, but I think I maybe got five minutes of work done the whole day.

By the time I packed up my desk and left, it was dark and freezing outside. Clumps of wet, heavy snow pelted me all over, and without my thick winter coat my clothes were soaked through pretty fast. I stood at the bus stop shivering hard, the wet cold sharp against my skin.

The bus was late, and yet I was still the only person standing here, a lone figure under the dull light of the streetlamp, surrounded by darkness.

I was about to descend into a spiral of self-pity about that until I heard the noise behind me.

The quiet clacking of heels on pavement, and then--

*eh-UM*

I whipped around before I could even think about it and thrust my open hand toward the noise and my fingers wrapped around Susan's soft, fleshy neck, and I PUSHED.

\*\*\*

I sat at Gwen's kitchen table. It felt like no time had passed since I was at the bus stop, but my clothes were completely dry and my scratches were healing.

The sun was setting. Outside looked cold, but in here it was cozy. There was a fire crackling away in the fireplace. I had a blanket over my shoulders and a steaming cup of tea in front of me. And Gwen was roasting something rich and savory in that old-fashioned oven.

""Ah, Nathan! You're back with us."" Gwen sat across from me, chopping up some of those vegetables I'd seen in her garden.

""What's going on? How did I get here?""

""You've been sitting here a while, but your mind was somewhere else. Seems it's finally caught up.""

She hadn't answered either of my questions.

""Where's Susan? Is she okay?"" I asked.

""Don't you worry about that. She's not your problem anymore.""

""What...what does that mean?""

Gwen shrugged, eyes still pointed down at the vegetables. ""I told you I'd help you take care of your problems. Seems only fair you help me with mine, don't you think?""

There was a hissing sound from inside the oven--fat dripping down and sizzling on the searing-hot metal.

I stared straight into her eyes, waiting for her to say more. But she didn't.

""That...the guy who killed my mom. That was you, too, wasn't it? Or, me. Us.""

Gwen smiled slightly, still said nothing.

""Why is this happening?""

""I told you the first time we met. It's dangerous to go through life just letting things happen to you. To become an empty shell. Leaves room for all kinds of things to seep in.""

""What are you?""

""What do you think I am?""

Shadows grew up around her, emphasizing her sharp edges, the hollow places beneath her cheeks, the emptiness in her eyes.

I didn't want to say it. Despite everything that had been happening, I felt so stupid even thinking it.

But Gwen was waiting.

So I blurted it out as fast as I could: ""Are you a witch?""

She stared silently at me for a long time--so long I almost thought she hadn't heard me.

Then she threw back her head and cackled.

""A witch! I suppose I can see why you'd think so. But no, Nathan, I am nothing so pedestrian as that.""

""Then what--""

Gwen’s face split into a grin–too wide, too many teeth--and the world went dark around us. No, not just dark--gone. Like Gwen had taken the clearing with the cottage and ripped it away from the Earth, the universe, entirely, and thrown it into an abyss, a horribly empty place devoid of life and light and hope.

I wanted to scream but there was no sound here except the deep, guttural groan of the blackness surrounding us. I felt my mind start to break apart, crushed under the gravity of this nowhere place, my memories and my sanity gushing out, everything that comprised my existence rushing away, vanishing into the void.

Suddenly, the abyss was gone, and the world I knew was back.

For a long time, I was too scared to move or speak. My existence felt fragile, like drawing attention to myself might tear me away again into the nothingness.

Then Gwen spoke.

""I am something far older than a witch. I am the well your witches draw from. The most powerful among them can only ever hope to skim the surface of my power, seize just a few droplets before it overwhelms them.""

""For fuck's sake, would you just say--""

""I am of the fae.""

I stared at her, utterly lost.

Gwen rolled her eyes. ""More commonly known, these days, as a fairy.""

""A fairy? Like...like fucking Tinkerbell?""

""I am like nothing in your fairy tales. You think that little pixie could do what I have done?""

""I wouldn't put it past her,"" I muttered. ""She was kind of a bitch too.""

Gwen cackled again. ""I suppose you have a point.""

""And if you're so powerful, why do you need me to do your bidding? That's what I've been doing, isn't it?""

""My power is great, but it is tied to these woods. I cannot leave.""

""So just eat me then. Get it over with.""

Gwen shook her head. ""Not many of your kind wander here anymore. No cast-out children leaving breadcrumb trails, no weary travelers looking for a safe place to rest. When I finally lure someone in, I must use them for all they're worth.""

""I won't do it. Not anymore.""

""Oh, I think you will.""

I swept my arm across the table, sending my teacup crashing to the floor. It shattered there, the liquid staining the wood black. ""No. I won't.""

""Hmm,"" said Gwen. ""So you'll go back to your life, as it was? No one left who loves you, a job you're bound to lose, a home that's slowly rotting away? I can give you more than that. Much more.""

I wish I'd had the strength to stand up then, to walk out. I don't know if she'd have let me, but I should've tried.

Too bad I'm a fucking coward.

""Remember that first day, after you left? How things seemed like they were coming together? That was just a taste of what I can do for you. *If* you help me in return.""

I didn't answer at first. Not for a long time.

""What would I have to do?""

Gwen's mouth stretched into that creepy, too-wide grin. She stood and started preparing another cup of tea.

\*\*\*

I don't recall ever going home or sleeping that night. Next thing I knew, I was sitting in my office chair at 9 AM on the dot, scanning through my emails. From the corner of my eye, I could see that Susan's desk was empty.

I breezed through my tasks. I barely even remember doing them. My boss came back to my desk, said more nice things about me going places if I kept it up.

Then it was dark, and I was climbing into the passenger seat of Barry's car. I sorted through my personal emails as Barry got his usual playlist set up. They were mostly bullshit, except for one: an email from a company in the town where I used to live, asking me to interview for a job I didn't remember applying for.

I was still trying to process this when my phone dinged.

A text. From Alyssa.

My mind reeling, I switched the screen off and put the phone back in my pocket.

Then it was just me and Barry, rolling along through the dark.

That awful, lingering stench was still there, as always. Some horrendous Christian rock band crooned through the car's speakers--and this time, Barry sang along. That was new. His voice was off key and horribly shrill.

For fuck's sake, why was he doing this? Why couldn't he like normal music? Even fucking showtunes would be better than this. Why did this asshole have to be so goddamned *annoying*?

The rage came over me suddenly, before I could even register what was happening. I wanted to grab him by the hair, slam his face into the steering wheel again and again until his face was obliterated, I wanted to send the car careening off the road and into a ditch just to make it fucking STOP

I held back, barely. My fists balled up tight, drawing blood from my palms.

I would wait until he pulled up outside my building. I would bring him to Gwen in one piece.

I’m not married; however, I live with my partner and thought married folks would provide the best advice. Essentially, we both feel unappreciated and a bit burnt out.

Background: together 2 1/2 years; living together almost 1 year. Both late thirties. Both work full time remotely. Both work in IT (him app dev; me healthcare). Both have had to work hard for what we have as we don’t have help from family. House never feels clean or seems to stay clean.

Him: Owns his own home (ex gf is on the mortgage); makes 3 x what I do; pays mortgage, utilities, his bills. Does bulk of grocery shopping and large expenses. Works from coffee shop daily.

Me: in new role that is complex and more demanding, prepping to go to grad school, do bulk of cleaning, cook most meals, do most of the mental load type work (planning, organizing, research, holidays), does most of the emotional labor in relationship. Buy furniture that he needs, pays for most food  delivery. Pay all my own personal bills (paid my car off). Had a bad medical situation midway through our relationship so have had medical debt to pay.

Issue: I feel as if he does not clean enough nor does he appreciate the amount of invisible cleaning I do. He feels as if he does clean and I don’t notice. He feels unappreciated for the amount he pays.

First off, I want to say I do appreciate how much he does for me and pays. He is a great man in many ways and has worked his ass off in life for the job and lifestyle that he has. I have also worked my ass off…I just don’t make as much to show for it. I want to make more money to ease the burden in that way (I make about 80k per year) and am taking steps to do so. 

I truly want to find a solution that makes us both feel seen and appreciated: For the bills stuff, he does pay more and we have tried to work out rent/bill splitting by proportion to our income. I didn’t feel comfortable paying rent upfront as his ex gf was still on the mortgage (I’m also saving for my own house.) That being saiid, I’ve tried coming to a compromise on me paying all utilities and groceries. But, whenever he goes shopping he never sends me the request or tells me the amount and when I insist he tells me it’s ok. He also said initially he didn’t want me to pay any rent or anything because I was saving money and my medical expenses at the time. I don’t feel comfortable with this because I’ve always been independent and never want to feel like I’m mooching off someone else. Also, it always comes up in fights later that I don’t pay rent and then when I try to send it he tells me no just forget it. I already pay a lot in proportion to my income for our entertainment, dining out, gifts for him, stuff for the house. 

For chores, I honestly feel like I’m constantly working or cleaning. He has so much leisure time for his hobbies and then chastises me for not doing mine. I don’t feel like I have the time nor energy to enjoy them. I have back to back meetings most days and mutlitask cleaning while working. When he’s home, I would prepare him three meals a day. When he’s working at a coffee shop, I’ll make him dinner. I was doing his laundry for the first half of our relationship but stopped. Now, his two hampers are usually full and he’ll start putting his stuff into other hampers (mine, towel hamper) or all around the house. I’m constantly picking up after him but he thinks he’s doing the same with me which boggles my mind. One day, I decided to take all the things of his left out around the house and put it in his office. I did this so he could have a visible representation of the invisible labor I was doing. Instead of  it being a light bulb moment, he was upset that his office (which he barely uses) was a mess and thought I was being passive aggressive. I don’t feel like there’s any getting through to him and whenever I bring up how overwhelmed I feel, he tells me how he’s so confused why things can’t stay clean - because when he lived alone the house was always clean. Not only does it make me feel unheard, but completely unappreciated and even feeling like things were so much better for him when he lived on his own. I even tried telling him I was purposefully taking a step back from cleaning for a couple weeks to see if it made a difference. It did. The place was a mess, he was really stressed about it and telling me he felt like he was the only one cleaning. I told him that was the point so he could see how much labor it took to keep up. When I’ve asked him to step up during times I have busy weeks, he forgets and then gets upset again about how messy the house is. I’m burnt out. 

1. Since we both feel like the other doesn’t appreciate the amount of effort visible cleaning that we do, what is a good way to track that so both parties have an understanding of what the other does?

2. What would be a fair way to divvy up expenses in this situation?

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

Before this situation, we hung out *daily*. I’m her daughter’s Godmother and have always been close with her family. Like any long friendship, we’ve had ups and downs, but we always worked through them... until now.  
  
A few years ago, my husband (35M) and I went through the hardest thing we’ve ever faced: unexplained infertility. Most of our close friends, including Phoebe, already had kids, and we were among the last to start trying. I’d never had cycle issues and we were both healthy, so I never thought we'd have any problems getting pregnant.

We started trying in early summer 2022, right after I was the MOH in Phoebe's wedding. To put it plainly, my friendship with Phoebe has always felt one-sided, even though I never wanted to accept it. I am also VERY type A, while she is VERY type B.

In 2018, Phoebe was my MOH. Looking back, it seems that the title was more important to her than the responsibility that came with it. I had to rely on other bridesmaids because she always had an excuse. She skipped dress fittings and tastings and didn’t show up for things she really should’ve prioritized. I’m not one to keep score, but it feeling unsupported by my so-called best friend was painful.

Despite it all, I took my role as her MOH seriously. She was very hands-off as a bride, which meant I was essentially at her beck and call. By the wedding day, a lot of stress was taken out on me. After the wedding, I intentionally created some distance to protect my mental health, and we reconnected in the fall.  
  
Part of me wonders if our relationship unraveled because I pulled away after such a significant day. I know I absolutely share some of the blame, but what came next changed everything.

That same time, my normally clockwork cycle was suddenly off. I was two weeks late and repeatedly testing negative, while dealing with symptoms like nausea, headaches, extreme fatigue, and breast pain.

After two weeks of strange symptoms and no period, I opened up to Phoebe, telling her I suspected I was pregnant but that something felt wrong and that I was considering seeing a doctor. I felt completely invalidated when Phoebe brushed me off and redirected the conversation to announce ***her*** ***positive*** **pregnancy test** and upcoming doctor’s visit. I congratulated her, spent a little more time at her house, then went home to re-group and gather my thoughts.  
  
Later that week, while I was at another friend's house, Phoebe called to tell me she was pregnant with *twins*. I tried to be present and supportive, congratulated her and her husband, and let her talk about the appointment. I was happy for her, but I still didn’t feel well and admittedly didn’t have much emotional capacity to offer, so we didn’t talk much after that.

That weekend, I started bleeding heavily, far more than a normal period. I called my doctor who couldn't see me for another 3 days, and scheduled an appointment for early the following week.

That very same day, I got a text from Phoebe, saying she was hurt that I wasn’t as excited for her as she had hoped, even suggesting that my reaction came from *jealousy*. I'll admit, I became instantly defensive. It felt like I was being kicked while I was already down: dealing with health concerns, fertility fears, and trying to confide in my best friend, only for it to be turned back onto her. It wasn’t that I wasn’t happy for her; her expectations just felt impossibly high in that moment.

The conversation escalated into a major fight, and I told her I needed space. Between how stressed I already was from my health and this huge fight blowing up, my husband urged me to block her, so I listened.

At my appointment, doctors confirmed I’d had a chemical pregnancy. My hcg levels had been too low for the cheap strip tests to detect, which is why I never got a positive pregnancy test.

During my time apart from Phoebe, my husband and I met up with some of our mutual friends. That’s when we learned they already knew about the situation... from *Phoebe’s* perspective.   
  
She had told our mutual friends, and God knows who else, that my husband and I were trying to get pregnant and that we were “racing” her and her husband to do so. To be clear, we weren’t. I'm not sure if this was stemming from her own insecurities, as I had gotten married 6 years before her and become a homeowner, but I never viewed our lives as a competition, especially since she had already become a mother years earlier.  
  
Hearing this was humiliating. While I'm generally an open book, infertility is incredibly personal, and I wasn't ready to share *my* story.

After a few weeks, I asked Phoebe to meet me for coffee. I came prepared, shared what I’d learned, took ownership of my shortcomings, and tried to talk it through. She took no accountability, instead doubling down on accusing me of jealousy, and even accused me of **faking** my chemical pregnancy, saying that I ""would've had to get a positive test at home if I were really pregnant"".

The whole conversation was completely unproductive. It felt like she *needed* me to admit that I was jealous of her in order to validate herself.

Fast forward to now, I have an almost two-year-old daughter, and I’m grateful to have made it through infertility. Phoebe and I have seen each other only about a dozen times over the last few years. While I’ve physically moved on, I’m not emotionally over that period of my life, and I don't know if I ever will be. So far, it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through, and I’ll always remember who showed up for my husband and I when we were at our lowest.   
  
I recognize my mistakes too, but without accountability or an apology on her end, our relationship feels permanently stained. I sometimes miss what we once had, but I can’t seem to forget everything that happened. Every time I try to reconnect or see her now, I’m reminded of how she made me feel during the most painful time of my life.

This has been eating me alive for months, and I would genuinely like to know if I am in the wrong. So please, be honest... AITA for ending a 25-year friendship over how my best friend treated me during infertility?",3,1767383997.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False
1q28vul,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1q28vul/a_lot_of_questions_about_unmasking_since_my/,A lot of questions about unmasking since my experience seems off,"I see many posts about how unmasking wrecks a person's social life. Has unmasking actually *helped* anyone else socially? I'm certainly not excelling socially. I've lived in my city for years and don't have any local friends (but I do have my dog and long-term partner <3).

(The closest I've come is an older lady whose garden plot is next to mine. We chat a couple times per gardening season and I feel we're kindred spirits. If she invited me to socialize I would happily do so even though she's several decades older.)

While I crave community I'm somewhat content not having friends. So when I say I'm doing better socially I mean I'm able to work in an office once a week without any of the major misunderstandings that plagued me in the past and led to me losing jobs.

In my teens I started getting comments about how I was perceived. People would often tell me they had thought I was a bitch or stuck up when they first met me. It would make me really sad (and uncomfortable) to have that dropped on me once they felt comfortable.

Note: I don't know if this facade I put up starting in my teens was a result of middle school which was a disaster - I still have nightmares about the bullying once in a while.

Even after people got to know me they'd still say I was intimidating and they'd never give me the benefit of the doubt if I misspoke/misstepped. It's like I was always fighting a losing battle against these bitchy/intimidating/stuck up accusations.

In my early 20s I had to take on a lot of adult responsibility and became outwardly type A to survive. So I understand why people who knew me then think of me a certain way and I've distanced myself. Now that my financial needs are met I've somewhat reset to my true self.

Before realizing I'm likely AUDHD I'd already started strategically unmasking a little. I didn't know I was unmasking. But I was letting my hair be natural, dressing down, and showing more of what people probably consider a 'quirky' side in an effort to be less intimidating.

Note: In a way it's **unmasking** my oddball traits while **masking** my intimidating traits so not a total unmasking. But am I just downplaying less palatable parts of AuDHD so they only see the 'cute', 'quirky' parts? I truly don't know.

All of a sudden people gave me the benefit of the doubt. Less men wrongly assume I'm interested in them sexually. Women no longer think I'm a bitchy, stuck up person. When I misspeak the worst I get is an 'Aww, OP is awkward and doesn't know any better' look.

I'm being treated like a proper weirdo and taking full advantage. I gather many of you disdain being infantilized or pitied because you've had to endure it throughout life. But I'm just so, so happy to exist without having these accusations lobbed at me.

While I know this won't result in an upward career trajectory I kind of don't care. I'm content to stay in a stable role that won't be threatened by how I'm perceived. No one is threatened by me now, and even if they don't like me, they'd risk looking like a bully if they acted on it.

Like I said the unmasking is very strategic. I haven't unmasked fully and don't intend to. If I get an official AuDHD diagnosis I likely won't tell my coworkers. They know next to nothing about me anyway because they're more wrapped up in themselves and their cliques.

But if I did, I think it would be the missing puzzle piece (just like it was for me) whereas people from my past wouldn't believe it. The ADHD part was so shocking but I've suspected autism for many years and people disagreed saying I was too this or too that.

Sometimes I get a little sad if I'm being spoken down to which happens daily. I know I'm capable of much more. But am I consistently capable of high performance? Probably not. Tbh it's probably better to continue hiding my natural aptitude and letting my freak flag fly.

One of my coworkers is very belittling. Sometimes she does get to me, but for the most part, it kind of amuses me that she thinks so little of me. Being so capable (and hiding it so I can funnel it in to my interests) instead of letting her drain me feels like a secret flex.

But there's something that makes me question if I'm even an AuDHDer. Masking/unmasking doesn't seem to cause me great pain like it seems to cause others. It almost feels like a game where I play a character and tell myself ""you're going to be a normal person today"".

Note: Socializing does cause exhaustion masked or unmasked. When I say it doesn't cause pain I just mean it doesn't deeply hurt my soul 24/7.

One time two new team members joined and I decided I was going to turn over a new leaf. There's a team member who I like observing because she's so socially adept. When she started she asked me to get coffee so I copied her message and asked them to get coffee.

At coffee it was like a game pretending to be her. I did very well socially that day but keeping it up was too tiring, plus it was weird for my relationship with them to be so different from the rest of the team, so I suddenly went back to how I actually am.

Note: If I'd pulled this in the past they would've concluded I was bitchy and stuck up. But because of my strategic unmasking I'm given the benefit of the doubt.

I could tell it confused them and they even asked if I was okay. Eventually they seemed to understand but once in a while I'll revert back and it's like they're confused all over again. But the whole thing amuses me a little and that makes me question if I'm an AuDHDer.

If I thought I was hurting anyone I'd absolutely stop. It's not a matter of me doing it to play games *with* people. More like just taking a break from myself, role playing for awhile, and proving to myself I can be socially adept if I follow certain steps. Some days I feel like I 'won' at masking.

Deep down I probably want to be seen and accepted as I am. But in the end being perceived seems so scary. Masking/unmasking strategically is kind of working out - half the time my coworkers forget about me and I can happily do my own thing. Is that bad?

Another thing to mention is maybe my strategic unmasking hasn't even been successful. In my new city there's a culture of being passive aggressive. So maybe I'm perceived as I've always been but people are too reserved to say it to my face?

I've always felt like I need to get all the 'steps' right and I've figured out a pretty good basic formula since starting this job. I'm clean/hygienic, I give my female coworkers compliments, I ask questions and remember their answers, and the biggest one - I bring baked goods.

I've tried to say the truth more but I usually regret showing myself. A coworker assumed I love baking and I said I'm shy (a half truth - I don't think 'shy' is the right word but it's more accepted than 'anxious') and bringing baked goods is my way to show I like everyone.

So it's possible I've just gotten a better basic formula. Is that masking or just learning how to behave? I think the compliments have helped me with other women (just don't compliment men), and crazily enough, I learned that from watching Real Housewives!

Sorry this was so long. My post was originally just asking if unmasking has helped you socially, but the more I typed, I began to question if I've even unmasked? By the end of this I feel like I've actually masked *more* in some ways.

Edited to add: I just reread what I typed and think what I actually thought all along but somehow never typed. That I'm masking in some ways that cause minimal energy BUT it's so I can unmask in other ways for maximum enjoyment. For example, I bake some cookies so people will know I'm not mean-spirited when I inevitably say something wrong.",1,1767383982.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False
1q28uj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q28uj0/aita_for_cutting_off_my_best_friend_after_she/,AITA for cutting off my best friend after she accused me of faking a miscarriage?,"Hi Two Hot Takes fam. This one is long, but I could really use some insight. I’m struggling with whether I made the right decision to cut off my lifelong best friend.  
  
I (30F) met my best friend Phoebe (30F) in kindergarten, and we’ve been friends for 25 years. Before this situation, we hung out *daily*. I’m her daughter’s Godmother and have always been close with her family. Like any long friendship, we’ve had ups and downs, but we always worked through them... until now.  
  
A few years ago, my husband (35M) and I went through the hardest thing we’ve ever faced: unexplained infertility. Most of our close friends, including Phoebe, already had kids, and we were among the last to start trying. I’d never had cycle issues and we were both healthy, so I never thought we'd have any problems getting pregnant.

We started trying in early summer 2022, right after I was the MOH in Phoebe's wedding. To put it plainly, my friendship with Phoebe has always felt one-sided, even though I never wanted to accept it. I am also VERY type A, while she is VERY type B.

In 2018, Phoebe was my MOH. Looking back, it seems that the title was more important to her than the responsibility that came with it. I had to rely on other bridesmaids because she always had an excuse. She skipped dress fittings and tastings and didn’t show up for things she really should’ve prioritized. I’m not one to keep score, but it feeling unsupported by my so-called best friend was painful.

Despite it all, I took my role as her MOH seriously. She was very hands-off as a bride, which meant I was essentially at her beck and call. By the wedding day, a lot of stress was taken out on me. After the wedding, I intentionally created some distance to protect my mental health, and we reconnected in the fall.  
  
Part of me wonders if our relationship unraveled because I pulled away after such a significant day. I know I absolutely share some of the blame, but what came next changed everything.

1q28ui4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q28ui4/opinions_needed/,Opinions needed,"So, we have been married for 25 years and recently took a trip to Guatemala to visit some of my family.  We hadn’t seeing my brother in 24 years, so the very next day he invited us over because he was hosting a friends and family Christmas party.  My wife and I showed up at around 7:00 pm and everything was fine, then my wife starts drinking shots of tequila and mezcal and I asked her to be cautious and slow down but she brushed me off, she was having shots with my sister in law, nieces and nephews who are late 20s.  Around 7:30 my wife was really drunk, so I was keeping an eye on her the whole time. A little context before I keep going, we have established rules for each other when it comes to dancing with someone else, she didn’t like it when I danced with other females so about 23 years ago we agree that our parents and siblings were always ok to dance with ( no brainer, safe zone ).  So going back to the party, next thing I know is she asks my brother for a dance, he es 55 she is 49.  And it didn’t bother me at all except that I notice that my brother ( who was also drinking but wasn’t that drunk) started holding her and looking at her on a very creepy way. I decided to let things go and convinced myself it was all in my head.  I was having some fun with my nephews drinking a beer and singing along.  Around 8:30 pm my wife kept asking for shots and my brother would comply but next thing I know they are holding hands, they were sitting next to each other holding hands. My mom, his wife and his friends and kids were there too hellooo!!!?!!!  I started to feel very uncomfortable and asked my brother for another drink forme so that he had to get up and let my wife’s hand go, that’s exactly what happened but….. my wife got up and came next to where he was and grabbed his hand.  I was very upset and confused but try to keep calm and composure.  He was then rubbing his fingers on my wife’s hand and she would do the same, I had to act quick, ( was everyone else seeing these?? I am imagining?? But I did see my brother’s wife noticeable vigilant ) coincidentally my mom wanted to leave and I had the hardest time convincing my wife to go with me and drop her off, we finally took off and drop mom off and I asked her for some coffee to help my wife sober up, we spent about 90 minutes at my mom’s and then went back to the party.  First thing my wife does is ask my brother for more shots and he sat down next to her and the holding hands thing stared again, I told them to smile for me for a picture and before I could snap the picture he let her hand go ( that to me proved he knew what he was doing). I didn’t know what hat they were talking but at a moment he grabs her head and hair with his two hands in a very affectionate gesture and tells her something to her ear. I’ve had enough and wanted to leave, before I can wrap things up and leave, he decides he wants to hear a different type of music and tells my wife to go downstairs, yes the two off them, alone. She was holding his hand and willingly going, but I told my brother that I had come to spent time with him and he literally physical pushed me away and asked me no to come along, I was waiting for my wife to react but she was probably too intoxicated. I didn’t let them go alone and came downstairs with them and sat my wife away from him but he was visibly very upset, like he couldn’t do whatever he had in mind.  My wife finally agreed for us to leave and we went back to our hotel, the whole thing is killing me and I told my wife and she says that she doesn’t recall anything at all.  Maybe some flashbacks but nothing more. Any feedback please. During the whole time, not even once she came to me and held my hand at was affectionate with me.",1,1767383899.0,Marriage,2,0.99,False

I got the following:

\- Panettone Ciocolatto  - Federico Cantelli

I was really excited for this one from the notes however I was sadly disappointed. I feel like its a very bready and nutty chocolate fragrance. The projection is there 100% but the scent itself just isnt for me.

\- Eviasion BonBon - Maison Mahata

This one I didn't pick out they were just kind enough to send me an extra sample which I appreciated. However, I also don't like this one. It smells like bubblegum to me which makes it feel quite childish in my opinion. The dry down is a nice vanilla but I don't think that saves it.

\- Cafe de Delices - Maison Mahata

I really want a nice coffee fragrance and I think this is a nice contender. This is a very sophisticated gourmand, not like anything I've actual smelt before. It's a lovely biscuity latte scent which I enjoy. Definitely one that I'm considering ordering in a full size.

\- Popcorn Cake - Federico Cantelli

I added this one in for funsies and I thought it would be interesting to try. This is just straight up caramel popcorn with a hint of salted butter. It's unique to say the least and not what I expected.

\- Lick Me - Michela Mezzetti

Dulce by Rosie Jane is now one of my favourite perfumes ever and I noticed the notes aren't too different from this one which put Lick Me on my radar. It is definitely a lovely sweet vanilla ice cream which I really enjoy and I think this will be an amazing summer fragrance.

\- Bianco Latte - Giardini Di Toscana

I LOVE this. Bianco Latte has been on my wishlist for 2 years now but I couldn't afford it. I toyed around with the idea of just blind buying it due to the mixed reviews. However, I have not been disappointed. Will be buying the full bottle.

\- Escapade Gourmande - Maison Mahata

Another favourite from the bunch. It's a gorgeous brown sugar, vanilla scent that I just cannot stop sniffing. I will be trying to get my hands on a full bottle when I have more money!",4,1767383832.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

It's not super noticeable, but I wanted to make that clear since the piston is not removable for cleaning. The broad nib on this is probably one of my favorites; it's super juicy and smooth, but I do not enjoy the slightly triangular grip section. Includes original box

**Junlai / Wingsung 630, Teal/Gold, Medium Architect Steel Nib** | Asking Price: $25  
Condition: A2 | \[[Image](https://imgur.com/q8cNwbN)\]  
A fun, large piston filler pen with a custom grind from Bobby at StPenpps. A little finer than I prefer my medium nibs, but it has a good ink flow and nice line variation. Comes in an extra Asvine box I had lying around.

**Platinum Preppy, White Muji Var., Fine Steel Nib** | Asking Price: $15 each / $25 for both  
Condition: N | \[[Image](https://imgur.com/aIDVaOA)\]  
I have two spares of this pen. A great version of the Preppy, I love the solid white look of these. I have added an o-ring on each so they can be used eyedroppered. Each includes the cartridge it came with.

**Majohn / Moonman A2, Teal/Black, Fine Steel Nib** | Asking Price: $10  
Condition: N | \[[Image](https://imgur.com/5OyxvSN)\]  
Great as a starter pen. This is the plastic version of Majohn's retractable, so it's nice and lightweight. Includes all the accessories that came with it.

**Jinhao 10, Black/Silver, Fine Steel Nib** | Asking Price: $10  
Condition: N | \[[Image](https://imgur.com/zEZj4mw)\]  
Great as a starter pen. This is the metal version of Jinhao's retractable, so it has some heft to it. Includes all the accessories that came with it.

I fell in love with the pen this nib unit came on, and convinced myself I might actually be a flex nib enjoyer. I am, unfortunately, not a flex nib enjoyer 😂 This nib unit is still a lot of fun though, and should go to someone who will use it. You cannot buy this nib separately, so this is your chance to try it out on a pen of your choice. I believe the ebonite unit is Jowo threaded.

**Muji Aluminium FP, New Version, Extra Fine Steel Nib** | Asking Price: $10  
Condition: N | \[[Image](https://imgur.com/7oNXlty)\]  
This is a nice, lightweight metal pen. The step from the section to the body is a tiny bit sharper than I prefer, and I personally like the original Muji Aluminium FP more. That said, this is a great little starter pen. Includes original box and comes with a pack of extra ink cartridges.",1,1767383810.0,Pen_Swap,5,0.67,False
1q28ssh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyWinterCar/comments/1q28ssh/how_to_make_the_warehouse_job_actually_profitable/,How to make the warehouse job actually profitable and fit into the game,"We can all agree that the main job is made to break you and get you to quit. I mean how would you be able to experience everything the game has to offer when you have to waste so much IRL time there. Well after just 4 days of hard labour I found the solution:

Use and abuse them as much as they do you. You only have to be punched in, pack 1-2 boxes a day and interact with the job items from time to time to not get fired, the rest is up to you. As of right now I havent been able to find any value that checks if the charger boxes are put  together correctly so Ive been throwing more and more empty or half emtpy boxes into the mix. So hitting the quota for the day is done in literally like 3-5 minutes.

To lessen the wait time until I can clock out I just put the sofa and an alarm clock into the upstairs storage room. Sleeping during work did not have any negative effect on my work performance or time worked. The hours and boxes still count correctly and even my slackminutes arent rising much more than I anticipated (upstairs storage area isnt part of the workfloor i think and therefore you slack when going from and to the couch). 

I try to get to work with full fatigue so I can hit the quota, go to sleep, tend to my needs and then clock out and do whatever I want to do for the day. 

This means you can treat work like a tertiary base which you only visit to hit your quota, sleep and eat. You can do all you winter car stuff during off hours and still get paid in full for mostly sleeping. Only real bad thing is that you cant save there but I am okay with that.

Lore wise I'd even say that this is what Topless had in mind. The job is there to put pressure onto the player to conform to an expected lifestyle but it simply cant be maintained while staying happy and healthy. So every player will sooner or later quit or get fired so that they can move on to do what makes them happy and what is interesting to them. 

Buuuuut you can also sacrifice seing sunlight, eating healthy foods, quitting alcohol/ caffeine/ cigarettes, sleeping enough/ regularly and try to make it work for that extra payday or added challenge. I really like that this is possible and a choice to the player and not just one dimensional pain you do once and never again like the strawberry job was. 

Even after only 4 days of maintaining the sleeping at work schedule my character is noticably more addicted to alcohol, coffee and cigarettes. This is bc you're never actually home for long but rather on the road whenever you're not at work. 

You only eat gas station food so your stress cant be managed with anything else than smoking. This leads to weight increase and a stronger nicotine addiction. 

You dont always have running water near you so you chug beer like a madman without even realising it and fuck up your alcohol tolerance and addiction.

To make it to work without falling asleep at wheel you drink loads of energy drinks and coffee which in return make you get tired even faster.

Even this cheesy method of trying to use and abuse the workplace as much as possible is not maintainable in the long term in my humble opinion. And I love it. It really drives home the improvements regarding addictions and how important they now are in MWC compared to MSC. Also it highlights the message or story of the game once again by letting the player experience the slow but heavy downward spiral that comes from living in the short term and doing something you absolutely hate. You can really feel how each added day at work takes something from you and you start to wonder how long you can last before your body takes a break for you. 

I interpreted the meaning/ message/ story of the game to be a journey of self discovery, passion and returning to your roots after a time of losing yourself. You try out new things, revisit old places and hobbys and take care of your mental and physical health for maybe the first time ever. Maybe thats because I am going through something similar and I truly feel seen for the first time in ages but I still think that this exact train of thought I showed here was the one Topless had in mind when creating the game. 

That is what I call true art. A piece of work that conveys not just a single feeling or emotion but rather lets you naturally live through a whole part of the human experience. It creates a sort of special bond between its author and the people interacting with it because both partys will have this moment when it all clicks and you see the intentions behind everything and how they shaped your own first interaction with the piece. You see others interacting with it going through the same thing you did but slightly different. Yet in the end you both made an invaluable experience which only can be truly understood by those who have interacted with the same piece or actually lived through this irl. 

Being able to get this deep and philisohpical while talking about a game that barely is 1gb in size is not something I expected when it first released. I really want to show my love and appreciation for Topless here. He is a god when it comes to subtle or gameplay enforced storytelling. MWC is all I ever wanted it to be and so much more. Many hundreds of hours of fun will be had.

Anywhooo I will keep this lifestyle up for as long as I can and I will probably share my future findings here as well. So wish me luck in trying to become a rally and ice racing champion with a full time job and raging substance abuse problems :)

This explains so much.","I've always been the ""**strong one.**"" The one who never needs anything. I thought it was a good thing, but recently I crashed hard. Burnout, exhaustion, the works.

I started looking into why I can't just ask for help like a normal person, and I found this concept called the ""**Transactional Mindset.**""

Basically, if you have this trauma response, you view every interaction as a debt.

If someone buys me coffee -> I owe them a debt.

If someone gives me a ride -> I owe them a debt.

And because my brain is terrified of ""**owing**"" anyone (because in the past, owing people meant I was unsafe), I refuse the coffee. I refuse the ride. I stay ""**solvent**,"" but I end up totally isolated.

It’s like living behind a glass wall. You can see people, but you can’t touch them because the **cost** of connection feels too high.

It blew my mind to realize this isn't just ""**how I am**,"" but a glitch in my nervous system (specifically the Amygdala hijacking the prefrontal cortex).

I made a deep dive video analyzing how this mechanism works and the steps to actually turn it off (without having a panic attack). If you’re the type of person who researches their own brain to fix it, you might find this interesting:

I didn’t tell my boyfriend this, because I didn’t want it to seem like I was giving him a timeline/deadline. 

So he planned a surprise outing for us near year end. I know he was going to propose that day. He didn’t want to give me any hints as to what we’d be doing, so I had no idea how to prepare/dress. He knows I hate surprises and I have very high anxiety. I was expecting it to be something easy going/low key.

The day started off on a bad note, because I ran into my abusive parent who I’m no contact with and hadn’t seen in idk how long. I really would have preferred to NOT see them on that day (or at all). Seeing them always brings me down. But I tried to put that out of my head and carry on with the day. 

So we go to the outing and it’s an activity we’ve never done before. This gives me anxiety. Also, I wasn’t prepared or dressed properly for the activity, so I was very uncomfortable. I feel like he should have given me a heads up when he saw what I was wearing before we left the house. He could have just told me to change into something more comfortable for an active outing. I also ended up twisting my ankle during the activity, which also put a damper on my mood. I wish he would have just stuck with things he knows I/we enjoy. Instead of picking a random new activity for that specific day.

After that, we went to do another activity and it’s an activity that I specifically avoid doing, because 1) I’ve never enjoyed it and 2) it gives me anxiety. I was just surprised he picked this, out of all the things he could have picked. We’ve done dozens of activities together over the years that we’ve enjoyed, so it just seems odd for him to pick something random that he has no idea if I like. 

When we walked in and I realized what it was, I told him I was uncomfortable. So he asked the staff about cancelling. They said he would still have to pay at that point because of the timing. And it was VERY expensive, plus we drove over an hour to get there. He said he was fine forfeiting the money and leaving. But I felt so anxious and uncomfortable being in the situation and wasting his money, and not doing the activity he planned for the day. So I decided to stick it out. Had he told me what we were doing beforehand, I would have told him not to schedule that. But it was uncomfortable being IN the place with the staff in my face, and being forced to make a decision within 2 minutes of our appointment start time. I also wasn’t dressed for this activity, and we had to ask the place for accommodations because of what I was wearing. It was honestly embarrassing. I was also on the heaviest day of my period and that made it even more uncomfortable. Again, I would have worn something else to be comfortable, had I known what we were doing. I should have just worn sweat pants and a t-shirt for the things he planned.

I just started to feel upset like he didn’t really consider me when he planned any of this. It felt like he just threw together a random outing to get the proposal over with, instead of actually putting thought into whether I would be comfortable or happy during these activities. Even if I had been dressed properly, I would have grinned through all the activities and my anxiety, for the sake of the day. But it was all just too much.

I would have been happy to just go out to dinner or go get coffee or go for a walk or something, and then he propose. Instead, it was a day filled with anxiety, stress and uncomfortable situations for me. He could tell I wasn’t in a good mood, so he didn’t propose and we went home. 

Now, the year has ended and I regret it. I feel like I ruined the proposal. I wish I had just hid my feelings/anxiety and allowed him to finish out the day. But it’s hard for me to hide my feelings, and I really hate being put in uncomfortable situations, especially multiple situations back to back.",1,1767383644.0,Waiting_To_Wed,0,0.67,False

Ever feel like your savings are just… sitting there? Like a forgotten gym membership, collecting dust instead of gains? What if I told you that *right now*, your money could be working harder than you are?

Here’s the thing: **Most people underestimate their financial potential.** They see their savings as a static number—$10K, $50K, $100K—without realizing how much that could *actually* grow over time. Compound interest isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the secret sauce that turns ""meh"" into ""whoa.""

### **3 Ways Your Savings Could Be Hiding Serious Wealth**
1. **The ""Latte Factor"" Lie**
   You’ve heard it: ""Skip your daily coffee, and you’ll be a millionaire!"" But here’s the real kicker—**it’s not about cutting small joys, it’s about redirecting them.** That $5/day could turn into $30K in 20 years (assuming 7% growth). Now imagine if you *also* automated investments. Boom. Game changer.

2. **The ""I’ll Start Later"" Trap**
   Procrastination isn’t just bad for your to-do list—it’s *expensive.* Waiting 10 years to invest could cost you **hundreds of thousands** in lost growth. Time is your biggest asset, and it’s ticking.

3. **The ""Safe"" Savings Account Illusion**
   Keeping cash in a low-interest account? That’s like storing your groceries in a fridge that’s *slightly* less warm than room temp. Inflation eats it alive. **Your money needs to grow faster than your Netflix subscription.**

### **The Reality Check**
Here’s the wild part: **You might already have enough to fund a killer retirement—you just don’t know it yet.** Tools like [this one](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) can show you *exactly* how far your savings could go. (Full transparency: That’s an affiliate link, but it’s a legit way to see your money’s potential.)

So, ask yourself: *What’s one small move I can make today to let my money work for me?* Because the best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time? Right now.

Some background: I am in my young 30s, generally healthy, no smoking/drinking, occasional green tea, no coffee. I brush with an electric toothbrush twice daily (fluoride vs nanohydroxyapatite toothpaste depending on what's available/cheapest) and floss nightly. Sometimes I use Zellie mints. I usually am vigilant about twice yearly cleanings but have been moving a lot recently with lack of insurance so was about 2 months behind this last time. I was prescribed a night-guard which I had stopped using for a while, but have now started back up again. I am aware that I have quite ridge-y teeth.  

I recently moved and saw a new dentist who recommended I get fillings to prevent cavities. I tend to prefer no procedures on my teeth unless absolutely necessary, and generally prefer dentists who are a bit more conservative when recommending procedures. I've also been scammed before into getting more procedures than needed, so I am a bit cautious. I am looking for some education/possibly second opinions. 

Dentist took these images at the office, see imgur link. Said no cavities, but they quickly became concerned about my top molars. Initially said no need for procedure, then recommended one tooth filling, then after looking at my teeth with loupes, said three. They only looked, did not poke my teeth surfaces. They said they would need to drill out the stains in order to put the fillings in. No need for anesthesia. They said even if I only want sealants, that's fine, but they would still need to drill out the stains, and it's likely I had sealants in the past that fell out. So at that point, just get a composite filling

I'm actually not really sure exactly which teeth they recommended but have highlighted a couple that I think they were referring to. Definitely the two on my top left, and one on the top right that I'm not sure.   
[https://imgur.com/a/cLx16ji](https://imgur.com/a/cLx16ji)

Part of why I am a bit cautious is because of my trauma with getting unnecessary procedures (happy to go into detail if needed). Another thing is I noticed that everyone who walked out of this office before my appointment (at least 4-5 people) was prescribed multiple fillings, and the office was a bit pushy about scheduling an appointment for me to get fillings even after I said I wanted to think about it. Dentist seemed a little offended that I wanted to wait and think about it. So, I don't know if this is a red flag, or just a different style of what I generally prefer. 

So, is this a typical thing to recommend and everything sounds appropriate? Should I rush to get these fillings done? Can I wait to see if they get any worse with watching-and-waiting, now that I am back to wearing my night-guard regularly (hopefully not wearing my teeth down even more)? If I can wait, how long should I wait? If I can't wait, how long do I have before it's emergent? Do I really need fillings for all 3 teeth?

\------

**Day 16: A fragrance that is underrated**  
*Maison Crivelli - Rose SaltifOlia (full bottle)*  
In discussions about Maison Crivelli, I rarely see Rose SaltifOlia mentioned, and I honestly wonder why. Do people find it boring? To me, it is anything but! This is the perfect mineralic, coastal rose. It leans fresh instead of briny, but still smells like sea air with a hint of salt and rocks. A tea rose bush growing next to a bluff. It is quite a subtle scent, so I like it especially for fragrance-free-adjacent applications. **10/10**

**Day 17: A fragrance that makes you feel festive**  
*Parfum d'Empire - Wazamba (official brand spray sample)*  
I really wanted to have a day for festive, given the month and the time of year, but the truth is, I don't care for the scent profile typically associated with Christmas. 😅 So I picked a frankincense and myrrh scent instead, which is still very holiday-relevant. Wazamba opens very strongly medicinal (think Buckley's or Vick's Vapo-Rub) but dries down to an incredibly accurate Catholic church incense. Jury is still out on whether I want to get a full bottle, but I like it a lot. **9/10**

**Day 18: A fragrance that you expected to dislike**  
*Diptyque - L'eau Papier (spray decant)*  
I would never have even sampled this if I hadn't physically gone to a Diptyque and sprayed this on a card to see what all the fuss was about. I never expected a scent based on white musk and Iso E Super and/or ambroxan to be a new favourite, but here we are. This one opens with a laundry musk to my nose (like it literally just smells like dryer air scented with laundry detergent) but acquires a peppery woodiness as it dries down. It is, in a way, reminiscent of paper, like new book paper. I'm still in the infatuation phase with this fragrance, so maybe my obsession will cool off after a few months of wearing, but for now: **10/10**

**Day 19: A fragrance that makes you feel reflective**  
*Frederic Malle - En Passant (dabber sample)*  
I didn't have a fragrance in mind when I thought this one up and it shows. I ended up picking En Passant for the dream-like quality it imparts. It's watery lilac with a wheaty backbone, but the way it comes across is like a watercolour painting. Pastoral, with a nostalgic blurriness. This scent is very, very good in the late spring. I'll definitely upgrade to a spray decant. **9/10**

**Day 20: A fragrance that reminds you of a song**  
*Frederic Malle - Synthetic Jungle/Nature (spray decant)*  
The first time I smelled this fragrance, ""Memories of Green"" from Blade Runner came immediately to mind. Maybe I'm influenced by the name, but this fragrance has a very distinct ""synth"" quality to it. And it's very melancholic. The opening green note is *immense* and not at all natural. It starts loud (the synthesizer key is pressed) and continues throughout (the synthesizer key is held), but it grows softer as the fragrance dies down and mingles with some powdery jasmine, until it cannot be heard anymore. This fragrance is a masterpiece, Art™, and I adore it. **10/10**

**Day 21: A fragrance that was not love at first sniff**  
*Xinu - Copala (dabber sample)*  
I immediately hated this when I tested it first on paper, then on skin, at which time it came across to my nose as abrasive woods and not much else. I abandoned the sample for almost a year, but upon revisiting, I discovered the woods element was less abrasive and I was able to appreciate some resinousness and a sweet, but piquant vanilla. It will (probably) never be a hall-of-famer for me, but I like it! It's a far cry from the Hate it was at first. **8/10**

**Day 22: A fragrance that is non-linear**  
*Guerlain - Shalimar (vintage bottle)*  
One of my first experiences with true non-linearity was with Shalimar, although it was with a sample of the modern Extrait, which still had all of its top notes. My little bottle from the late '70s doesn't have quite the same opening anymore, but it has some more oomph to the middle and truly eternal longevity on fabric. Shalimar is truly singular in its scent profile: ""stinky"" bergamot opening, to jasmine + iris + civet, to powdery vanilla + iris + tonka. But even that description is reductive, because there is a symphonic quality, a baroque-ness, to all of the Guerlain extraits that kind of defies explanation. If I was only allowed to wear one fragrance for the rest of my life, it would be Shalimar. **10/10**

**Day 23: A fragrance that comes in an ugly bottle**  
*d'Annam - Vietnamese Coffee (spray decant)*  
It's all subjective of course, but fragrance bottles that look like acrylic eggs are not my idea of cute. 🙂 I do *really* like this fragrance though, so I will eventually have to decide whether I want to purchase an acrylic egg or just continue to buy spray decants. Vietnamese Coffee is exactly what I hoped it would be - a coffee scent that actually smells even remotely like coffee. It doesn't smell like black coffee, it smells like a traditional latte, where the only ingredients are espresso and whole milk. There's a sweetness, but it's really light and airy, like there are sweet things you're smelling nearby in the same café where you're having your latte. **9.5/10**

**Day 24: A fragrance that makes you feel happy!**  
*Armani - Light di Gioia (full bottle)*  
This scent is simple, but feels like happiness in a bottle. I would describe this as Dior Pure Poison's cheerful, optimistic younger sister. It's creamy gardenia and sunshine citrus and nothing else. 😁 The ultimate rainy day fragrance if melancholy is not your desired vibe for the day. **10/10**

**Day 25: A fragrance that is old**  
*Givenchy - Eau de Givenchy (vintage mini dabber)*  
I had just bought a sealed gift set of some Givenchy minis from (I suspect) the late '90s, and apart from my Shalimar bottle and a vintage Cabochard sample of unknown age, these are my actual oldest fragrances, so it had to be one of them. Since we were going to have people over for Christmas dinner, I picked what I hoped would be the lightest scent in the box. Upon application, I was surprised that this formulation of EdG had been marketed to women, since it struck me as a more masculine, shower gel type fragrance. There's a freshness and a florality to it that I quite like, but underlying it all is a Brut-like base which pulls it decidedly in a masculine direction. I do want to try wearing this in the summer, but I might prefer it on my husband. **8/10**

**Day 26: A fragrance that is new**  
*Les Indemodables - Immortelle Solaire (spray decant)*  
This is one of only two 2025 releases in my collection and what a worthy release this is, indeed. This smells like the last day of a golden summer, evening rays from a setting sun, autumn fast approaching. It has a kind of nostalgic haze to it and a well-judged vegetal note that reminds me of the smell of corn fields in the fall. This fragrance is a feat of perfumery, also Art™. There is a richness in here that can overwhelm if I overapply, so I have to be a bit careful with this one. **9/10**

**Day 27: A fragrance that is subtle**  
*Parfum d'Empire - Le Cri (official brand spray sample)*  
I didn't think too hard about this selection, because I frequently revisit this sample trying to Get It. The opening is sparkling, red berries and a little bit woody (very similar actually to Salute! by the same house, but I think it makes more sense in that one) and it pretty quickly dries down to a rosy/iris skin scent with ambrette musk. It's kinda soapy, very Clean Girl-coded. I keep wanting this fragrance to be just a little bit more than it is. **7/10**

**Day 28: A fragrance that was composed by your favourite perfumer**  
*Eris - Night Flower (full bottle)*  
I consulted the statistics and unsurprisingly, Antoine Lie is my favourite perfumer, having the highest overall rating with multiple contributing fragrances. So I picked one of my absolute favourites of his. This could count as love at first sniff as well, since I've never bought a full bottle so fast. It's similar to Musc Ravageur, but the cinnamon is subtler and this one is more animalic, with a birch tar note that is absolutely incredible, smooth and sueded but still phenolic and burnt-smelling. As such, it's more of a modern, edgy Shalimar. Goes perfectly with a leather jacket. **10/10**

**Day 29: A fragrance that features your favourite note**  
*Neela Vermeire Creations - Ashoka (dabber sample)*  
After consulting the statistics once again, I was surprised to discover that my most highly-rated note (with multiple contributing fragrances) was actually *Balsam fir*. I had expected birch tar. Fortuitously, I had a new sample with both of these notes listed on the brand's website, so this was my first skin test of Ashoka. I was... underwhelmed, to say the least. I was reminded of Rare Tiffany by Afnan a bit, except this one did have a whisper of - as promised - birch tar, before drying down to smell almost identical to the Good Girl Legere flanker, which is a lighter, more lactonic version of the original Good Girl. I had very few thoughts while I was wearing this, sure it was *nice* I guess, but it did not spark joy. Maybe my opinion will change with future wears, but for now, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. **5/10**

**Day 30: A fragrance that reminds you of someone else**  
*Frederic Malle - Portrait of a Lady (official brand deluxe spray sample)*  
The rose note in this fragrance is unlike rose notes I have smelled in other fragrances, perhaps because there are white florals (jasmine?) or maybe musks contributing to make this smell incredibly reminiscent of this pink bar soap that my late grandmother used to use. There is a dusty and dated quality to this fragrance that is clearly intentional, aestheticized with the incense note and evocative of old churches and Gothic architecture. There will always be a place in my fragrance wardrobe for PoaL in the winter. **9.5/10**

**Day 31: A fragrance that would be generally considered ""in season""**  
*Azzaro - Wanted Girl (official brand spray sample)*  
I wanted an agreeable scent for going to a relative's house for New Year's Eve, so I pulled out another of the designer floral ambers. This one is slightly sweeter, which can be overwhelming if I spray too much, but the woody amber base is smoother in this one than in the others. If I was going to buy a bottle of one of these, Wanted Girl might be the most cost-effective and one of the more well-blended options, I think. **8.5/10**

\------

I had a lot of fun doing this challenge - it motivated me to wear a scent every day of the month, whereas normally I'd probably skip a few days due to apathy. I was (mostly) able to select for my faves, but I'm already planning to do something similar in February with scent textures, where I'm not likely to be able to totally avoid pans. 🙂",0,1767383580.0,fragrance,0,0.33,False

My wife just got me a set of Knodos prep tools along with the bottomless portafilter. At first I was getting channeling and I couldn't eliminate with my prep so I could only assume it was the beans (I was using good beans but over 2 months old on roast date). So I went to a fresh roaster an got beans roasted one week ago.

Now even with the new beans I'm getting wildly under extracted shots. Like water is pouring through like there's barely anything in the basket. I've got my grinder on the finest setting possible, and i've upped my dose to 20-21g. The probably is the dose is now so large that its spilling out of the basket when I distribute.

My shot is super liquid, like I'm pulling 100g in 25 seconds.

My understanding is that at this point I should be using a finder grind and a larger dose... but I've essentially maxed those variables out... so what gives!?

I also adjusted my Tamper spring to the 30lb option.

* Breville Smart Grinder Pro 
* Breville Bambino Plus

About 4 years ago, my brother (currently 35 yo) was living in a different state and was on parole. He was unhappy were he was staying and would say that he was the only one paying any rent in the house he shared with multiple people, he was the only one that cleaned, and his room mates traded him like garbage. One of his roommates was also his boss and would with out his check and threatening to turn him in to his parole officer. Several times a month he would ask for money for cigarettes or food. I didn't mind helping for the most part, and had no problem saying no if I didn't have extra money. At the time my husband was diagnosed with a chronic medical condition that no longer allowed him to work around the house like he used to ( we are updating our old home). My brother said that he could help as that is what he does at his current job. He just needed to get off parole first and he should have permission to transfer if he paid his restitution. I offered to pay the $600 to get him to my state so that he could help my husband (mostly lifting and holding). After several months of waiting he told me that he was denied the transfer and still had to pay 200 fine, seperate from restitution. I never asked for my money back because he assured me that he would pay the fine and apply again. Needless to say that took two year.
Before he moved in with me and my family, I explained that we would help him out to get started, but he is expected to help around the house including chores, bringing in firewood, helping my husband with fixing up the house (things that everyone is expected to do including my two kids both over the age of 10). We provided him is own room, access to laundry, food, heat,and internet.It took him almost two months to get a minimum wage job. We provided transportation to his job for nearly three month before we asked him to contribute to the gas, as his job was often out of the way. After 6 months we asked that he pay 100 a month for part of the groceries and 300 for rent. During this time he should have been saving money to buy a car as he was making about 2000 a month and had less than 700 a month in expenses. He was often late for rent over the next 6 months, always had to be reminded to contribute to groceries, hardly ever  did his chore for the week, and would frequently avoid my husband when he mentioned tasks that needed to get done. When we would get frustrated enough to say something about his lack of contribution he would straighten up for about a week or two then fall right back into his old routines. When we asked for him to help pay for gas, he spent 60 dollars on a cab ride instead. 
By July of last year I was so frustrated with him, I told him that we needed to sit down and talk about his stay with us, and emailed him a proposed rental agreement outlining the rules, expectation, increased rent to 600 and how it was configured, our obligations and his obligations. He avoided us for a week, until I finally had to tape to the entry way a notice of eviction. He then finally decided to sit down, discuss the agreement, made some adjustments including rent being due on the first friday instead of the first day of each month. Included was also fees for not completing chores and being late on payment. 
For over a year he has been inconsistent with paying rent on time, states since he doesn't eat here (drinks coffee, eats left overs) he shouldn't have to pay 100 for part of the food portion of rent, doesn't do his chore and believes he shouldn't have to pay his chore for when other people have to do it, or pay a late fee when he fails to pay rent on time. Has also made statements that ""so and so said they would never charge family rent"". We have also heard from people that he says that he pays 400 a month for food for the house. My husband keeps track of the food or supplies we ask that he purchases and reimburses him. Not to mention the room he is using is absolutely disgusting ( food containers, drink cans, body hair, the bed we provided is black in places)
After 9 months of employment he saved almost 2000 to buy a crappy car that he was told he could have to replace after a year. In that year he: got a gf, the newest cell phone, a used car with a loan, multiple streaming/gaming subscriptions. He is currently behind on rent and fees by over 1500 dollars, and is upset when I sent him 2 messages reminding him that rent is due (neither he responded to). I normally wouldn't be so frustrated but I lost my job almost 5 months ago and In school full time. I explained to him that he nows that now is not a good time to not be paying rent, and that if I was an actual landlord and not his sister, he would have been out a while ago. I have looked at his finances and he currently carries deficit and that he is spending more than he makes.

1q28iuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1q28iuu/advice_for_severe_insomnia_with_no_root_cause/,Advice for severe insomnia with no root cause,"Apologies in advance for the long post:

Add the title suggests, I have been dealing with severe insomnia, yet I can't pin point what might be causing it. Most nights I get 1-3 hours of sleep. It has now come to a point where I don't sleep at all for a whole night. My brain won't shut off and is filled with endless, useless thoughts. My body feels tired, but as soon as I try to sleep, my brain becomes wired as if I've had 12 coffees. I'm getting frustrated and I don't know what to do.

For the record, I've always had issues with sleep ever since I was a baby. I'm a very light sleeper and sensitive to light. Have always struggled with sleeping in unfamiliar environments as well. I try to use sleep ear plugs and an eye mask which used to be effective, but now they don't really help anymore. I've aso tried listening to white noise but that doesn't seem to help.

I have seen multiple doctors regarding my sleep issues, all of which have failed to determine what thing or things may be contributing to my sleepless nights. I have seen a gynecologist who suspects I may have endometriosis (and ruled out PCOS). Ultrasound scans and hormone tests revealed nothing, so a lapscop surgery is my last resort to confirm whether I have it or not. The wait time for the surgery 12 months. I'm moving overseas within the next six, so surgery isn't on the cards atm. I have also had multiple blood and thyroid function tests, all of which have come back normal.

I've tried all of the classic meds (e.g., magnesium, melatonin) and antipsychotics (Quetiapine). The meds either didn't improve my sleep or I just built up a tolerance to them instead. Quetiapine in particular was pretty rough. It complicated my already dodgy menstrual cycles and it felt like I had been hit with a tranquilizer shot the next morning after a quarter pill dose. My already horrendous brain fog was just amplified by it as well.

I have also gone down the diet route as I have digestion issues. I'm on a FODMAP diet which does help minimise the excessive bloating I used to experience. I am intolerant to both gluten and dairy, so I limit those too. Alcohol and caffeine trends to increase my heartrate dramatically, even after one weak drink. On the rare occasion I do go out, when I get home I end up lying in bed while it feels like my heart is working overtime causing my body to feel like it's pulsing. I don't really drink at all anymore because of this.

I'm starting to wonder if I have undiagnosed ADHD - it runs in my family. I also wonder if I have some form of autonomic issue. I have an ectopic heart beat and experience heart palpitations at rest. I have caught my heartrate at 140 bpm while sitting completely still before. I'm an active person, and used to gym frequently prior to my insomnia becoming worse. I've tried to exercise to tire myself out, but that doesn't seem to work anymore.

And to top it all off, I'm in the final months of my master's degree. I work in a lab and I find I'm making the smallest of mistakes which jeopardises whole experiments. It's not ideal (or safe for that matter) to be in that environment while sleep deprived. On days where I hardly sleep, I just stay at home. Not ideal for a struggling student 😅

So, I've come to Reddit as a last resort. What could be going on with me? Has anyone had any shared experiences? I'm sick of just hearing that it's all in my head. Any sleeping tricks would be greatly appreciated too (aside from the classics like ""try breathing techniques"", ""counting sheep"" etc - they don't work for me).

Emotion: Emotion is really fucky wucky for me, in that its generally a mess lmao. I'd say I'm led by emotion – I can't dedicate myself to something if I'm not actively emotionally enamoured and driven by it, and often have new interests that I'll drop without hesitating because they outlived their novelty (hobbies, fandoms, people...)

 I often act as the therapsit friend and am very openly receptive to others emotions, because fulfilling their emotional crisis makes me feel better about not tending to mine lmao. I repress my emotions as I'm petrified of being a burden but will spill them out if someone approaches me with the intent of comforting me.

Logic: Logic is what I use to navigate the world, typology specifically – I like analyzing and understanding people to feel safe and guided in the external world. Logic is a means to an end, and I'll refer to tons of sources, people to form an opinion (I get VERY antsy if I don't reach a conclusion) and generally remain stern on my opinion once formed unless better evidence debunks my take. Empirical, rigid logic in structured systems is agonizing for me.

Voilition: I have plenty of goals and dreams yet none of the know-how to implement them, which brings me a great deal of frustration. I despise being seen as weak, delegated for my helplessness but I react with internal resentment moreso than asserting myself through insecurity. I want success without the work. Dedicating myself to a goal in competition or spite is how I work best lmao

Physics: I'm trying to get more in touch with physics, as I greatly adore aesthetics but struggle to implement them IRL. I often spend hours at a time customising aesthetics on e.g. website pages, Pinterest boards, game skins/avatars... I get overwhelemed in the physical environment easily and feel trapped in my body. I have familiar comforts I opt for (I've started my morning with some variety of bottled iced coffee latte for years now lol), though I don't have much attachment to the item itself per se, rather that theres nothing better.

I recently ordered a **1Zpresso J grinder**, but it hasn’t arrived yet and I’m starting to wonder if I made the wrong choice. After reading more and watching additional reviews, I’ve become more interested in the **ZP6**, but I’d prefer not to go much over **$150 USD**.

The grinder will be used exclusively for **filter coffee**, mainly **V60 and AeroPress**, so I’m prioritizing **clarity and grind consistency** over espresso capability.

Given this use case and budget, do you think the **1Zpresso J** is still a good choice, or would something like the **ZP6** (or another grinder in this price range) be a better fit?

Any advice or firsthand experience would be greatly appreciated.",1,1767383110.0,pourover,8,1.0,False
1q28hpr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q28hpr,2025 Coffee Recap: New Coffee Journey,"I used to drink basic sweet cold coffee almost every day. Then one day, my sugar levels spiked and that was the wake-up call.

I decided to quit sugary coffee and switch to black coffee. Started with Americanos, and over time began brewing my own coffee at both the office and at home.

Right now, my setup is pretty simple but solid: a V60 and a Moka pot. These days, my mornings usually start with a Japanese iced brew. I’ve experimented with around five different types of beans so far, learning what I actually enjoy instead of just drinking coffee for caffeine.

One of the best parts of 2025 has been starting a coffee page with my partner, where we explore coffee shops and cafés around Bhopal. It’s been a fun way to learn, taste, and document the journey together.

Somewhere along the way, this stopped being “just coffee” and turned into a real hobby. I started taking my brews seriously, dialing grind size, ratios, water, everything. I’ve probably spent close to ₹10k just learning the basics, and honestly, no regrets.

My goal for 2026 is to buy a good espresso machine and maybe even step into the coffee business in some form.   
  
Not sure where it’ll go yet, but I’m excited to find out.

1q28hms,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1q28hms/my_grandmother_told_me_to_dump_my_boyfriend/,"My grandmother told me to dump my boyfriend because ""commitment at my age is like leaving a party at 8pm.""","Just wanted to get some perspective on a situation that’s been bothering me for a while, it’s long so I’m sorry!

I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (27M) for about a year and a half now. By all my standards, he’s an amazing man with a great heart, good values and a family that’s basically included me in from the very beginning. Not by any means a bum, he does well for hisself, has a college degree and a career as a data analyst. I’m a biomedical researcher. I’ll include that he’s white and I’m black for context, it could be important.

My family, however, especially 2 members (my dad (47M) and my paternal grandmother (69F)

have been pretty critical, particularly my grandmother, making comments about my weight and rude comments about my other family members, their partners, and even my mother, who’s so sweet and unproblematic. Basically whatever she says my dad feeds off of and vice versa. For that reason, I’ve kept my love life pretty private, not really disclosing details or opening up about any love interests through college and into my adult life. I guess for the sake of wanting to protect my partner from the criticism that I’ve struggled with personally.

Since I can see a future with my boyfriend, I wanted my parents to meet him. I live across the country from my family which is the only reason they hadn’t met him yet. Well, eventually, in October, my parents came down to visit me and it was *ridiculous*. Part of the reason they came was to celebrate my mom’s birthday, and even before they made it to my city, my dad made sure to let me know that my boyfriend *wasn’t invited to have dinner with us-* a type of exclusion his family would never do. When they got in, I noticed that they didn’t really care to bring up when they were going to meet him or even ask about him. It bothers me

That they never ask how he is, or how we are because they’ve been prying about my love life all these years and suddenly they don’t care.

Anyhow, I set up a brunch at a grass wall brunch spot (ik bad choice) and we all met there. I was so nervous I knocked my mom’s glasses off hugging her. Everything is going good, but I notice my dad being an extreme hardass. He’s generally a pretty outgoing and talkative guy, but he was so unemotional and stern with him, even taking several phone calls during our meal. It was so odd to me but my boyfriend did his best to answer all his ridiculous questions. At the end of the dinner, the bill comes and the waiter hands it directly to my dad, who slides it out into the middle of the table. Now my boyfriend asked me many times if I thought he should pay for the meal beforehand and I didn’t know if the right answer was yes or no, and thought my dad could either be flattered or really offended. Given that the waiter handed it to my dad, he assumed he’d pay it. But after 20 mins my dad doesn’t take his card out and even picks up like 2 more calls, my boyfriend’s still chatting with my mom. Then my dad says very softly “alright we’ve got $300 here, rock paper scissors for it” well unfortunately, there’s a giant speaker behind my boyfriends head and he doesn’t hear that part. He loses and doesn’t take his card out either. Eventually my dad gives up, pays the bill and essentially storms out of the restaurant, not even shaking his hand bye.

Later that night my dad grills me at our dinner saying “*you don’t think that’s someone you could get married to”* and saying that he didn’t check off any boxes (which I don’t even know what they were?) meanwhile, my moms defending him and saying that he was great and my dad is overreacting. The next day, I wanted to meet my parents for coffee before the airport and thought my bf could redeem himself but my dad actually didn’t gaf.

Fast forward to three weeks ago, I decided I’d like to spend some time with my boyfriends family over the Christmas holiday, I thought it would be okay not to be home on Christmas Day because I spent around $2k on a family cruise that ran through New Year’s Day (which my bf also wasn’t invited to go). However, once I told my family I got all kinds of nasty messages from my dad and grandmother saying that they can’t believe I’d do something like this and that my family if so much more important than my bf, I never claimed that he was. I had super bad anxiety the week before Christmas will all them pressing me to change my flight to be home on Christmas. Ultimately I ended up keeping it, but I go a phone call from my grandmother right before that set me off. She called and basically told me that I need to not invest in my bf and I should date other men, because there’s so many kinds to experience and I don’t know what I like yet. Told me our relationship was moving too fast (???) Told me that my bf isn’t worth it, and basically told me to either break up with him or cheat on him with other men because he’ll stay if he loves me (???) some of the things she said genuinely made me sick to my stomach and made me feel extremely guilty for even bringing my bf into a situation like this, because he doesn’t deserve it. She told me to ponder on what she said and then revisited it on our vacation. Asking what I thought about it, then telling me that being committed or getting married at my age would be like going to a night party and leaving at 8pm. My whole heart is in pieces over it all and I’m really at a loss. I typically try to stay in my family’s expectations to avoid confrontation but I’m not destroying one of the best things that’s ever happened to me for them. I do want them to eventually be more comfortable with it, but I don’t really know how to proceed. Should I just do me and keep pissing them off or try for a resolution??

**TLDR**: I (Black, 24F) introduced my boyfriend (White, 27M) to my parents. My dad was cold and judgmental, while my grandmother is now calling me with ""advice"" to cheat or date other people so I don't ""waste my youth."" They guilt-tripped me for spending Christmas with his family despite me paying for a separate family cruise. I’m tired of trying to meet their impossible standards—how do I move forward?",3,1767383086.0,family,2,1.0,False

1q28h74,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ancient_Tiger_665/comments/1q28h74/mandarin_oriental_vienna_review_dont_do_ityet/,Mandarin Oriental Vienna Review (Don’t Do It….Yet),"Hello!

  
We recently returned from our annual Christmas time trip- this year to the Christmas Markets in Budapest, Prague and Vienna.  After lovely stays at the Four Seasons Budapest and Four Seasons Prague, we checked in to the new Mandarin Oriental Vienna.  As the Mandarin is brand new, I thought I would leave some thoughts (happy to comment on the other hotels if any questions).  Overall, I was very disappointed with our stay.

  
The hotel is brand new- so I expected some service hiccups.  However, given the brand and the price (our rooms were $1200 and $1500/per night) I expected they were confident they could deliver a great stay.  That was unfortunately not the case.  I will detail some of the numerous service issues below.  However, the hard product overall was also disappointing.  I expected this to be our new go to in Vienna but I’m not sure it will ever fully compete with some of the existing properties.

The lobby and check in area has a unique sculpture but is missing some grandeur.  Despite some Christmas decor, the lobby and hallways were very clinical (they must have used every bright white bulb they could find for the hallways!).  There was also some false advertising- I had booked a Mandarin Room and an entry level room for my mother in law.  Upon check in, the entry level room only had a shower (all photos and written information indicated a bathtub).  They were able to move her to a room with a bath however.  The Mandarin Room was spacious but a narrow rectangle.  Based on past experiences, the Mandarin Rooms usually have something that makes them unique- this room did not- it was simply larger by about 5 empty feet in the middle of the rectangle when compared to the other room.  The fixtures and finishes were nice as you would expect of a brand new luxury hotel.

The website also listed 4 dining venues- two restaurants, a bar, and a cafe/patisserie.  As it turns out these are all one restaurant- the fine dining is a private room, the patisserie is a coffee bar and cart of pastries in one corner, and the bar is in the other corner.  While the greenhouse-like space is lovely, it all seems a little budget for a new hotel like this.

  
Breakfast was listed as a buffet.  Instead you received an etagere- a three tiered platter of fruit, bread, and then a beetroot spread with crudite.  This has to be even more wasteful than a buffet as how many people are going to devour beetroot spread first thing in the morning.  It is also not ideal in a new hotel as you know service is going to be slow so the buffet at least would have allowed us to get in and out quickly.  When I asked for just the fruit we actually ate the next morning, we still received the full platter so we enjoyed our three slices of pineapple and some grapes while the rest went to waste.

  
The location is also not as good as expected.  It is a 5 minute walk from St Stephen’s which was lovely at Christmas given the market.  But outside of that time, I’m not sure that’s the most major draw.  The surroundings had little to offer and seemed a little more gentrifying than gentrified?  It felt like a normal city hotel but when you are comparing it to the Park Hyatt (Am Hof market out the front door and Prada next to the cafe entrance around the corner) or the Rosewood (literally come of the door facing Bottega) it didn’t feel nearly as lux.

The pool is a little nicer than competitors- heated but still cool (several ladies aborted their planned swims after dipping their toes) with several hydro stations and the sauna/steamroom are lovely.  However, there are a total of 4 loungers by the pool so those will certainly go fast.  Additionally, you can usually reliably stock up on bottled water at the spa or gym but the relaxation area only had a small carafe and some weird granola snack.

Now for the service issues-

Now, I know we brought some of this on ourselves and we debated staying somewhere else up to the last moment.  The opening was originally scheduled for October so I thought they’d have over a month to work out the kinks.  As it turns out it was pushed to just a week before our stay.  I was assured that all facilities were open and again, the rate was certainly full price.

Prior to arrival there was no request for preference lists or stay personalization.  There was a somewhat terse (but hey it’s Austria) email about early check in only being available for a fee.  We arrived well after check in time and our rooms were not ready as an inspection by housekeeping was still needed.  After some flailing about, one room was ready.  We went up but the keys wouldn’t activate the elevator.  The gentleman took us up to the first room (the entry level one without a bathtub) and then left us there while he went to get keys that worked for the other (Mandarin) room and then the new entry level room.  When he came back, we still didn’t get any room orientation- had to call later for the WiFi password, found out about the what’sapp with reception/concierge 3 days into our stay, and had to hunt for all the hidden plugs.

  
The most unacceptable issue was that our HVAC systems did not work.  The rooms have lovely radiant heated flooring in the bathrooms but it was so warm that it actually heated the room.  However, the room would not cool and as you turned down the temperature no air would come out of the vents.  When I first phoned reception, I was told to open a window.…. When I called back an hour later, they said “well we set your temperature manually so is air not coming out?”.  As it was not, I was told that unfortunately maintenance is only there during the day (seems like a bad idea when you are opening a new hotel).  After a mini-meltdown, they offered to move rooms.  As packing our belongings at 1 am didn’t sound appealing, they eventually offered a temporary room just to sleep in.  This lovely suite two doors down still didn’t have an HVAC system that I could adjust but at least it was set to a comfortable temperature.   This all happened in my mother in laws room as well but she’s British so she just suffered through and bitched about it to me in the morning.   The following day our HVACs were ”fixed” but I think that just meant the radiant heat was turned off so the room was tolerable with minimal airflow.

  
Service was also a total mess.  Housekeeping one day left my side table with an empty water bottle, my charge cord clamped in the drawer, and my glasses knocked on the floor.  I’m used to my glasses being carefully placed on a personalized wipe so this was a change.  Our first two nights we only got turn down for one despite it being fairly obvious there were two guests in the room.

  
Breakfast the first day I went down alone before my family joined.  This was too much for them to comprehend- when the third person asked for silverware they brought a placemat.  They asked again and got a napkin.  Third try they asked specifically for a fork and finally got silverware.  The second day after our night of not sleeping, I asked to place our order when they first approached to take our drink order as we were in a bit of a hurry.  The gentleman said “Oh I will be right back”- didn’t even take our drink order and then proceeded to refill the water glass at every table around us while I glared at him.  Eventually I was able to flag down someone in a different outfit who took our order and the food did come quickly (admittedly the mango in the yogurt bowl was amazing- like almost Badrutt’s Palace level).  

  
By the weekend of our stay, there suddenly seemed to be more people who knew what they were doing (more different outfits)- maybe I just noticed them because they were all gathered to great a VIP guest at the front door.  But you would think if you are opening a hotel you would have staff that know what they are doing available at all times!

  
I suspect that they will get the service issues figured out (if past experiences at Mandarin Oriental’s like Ritz Madrid, Barcelona, Lago di Como, and Hyde Park are accurate) but overall I was disappointed by the overall vibe and it just didn’t seem as grand as expected.

1q28gm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dominican/comments/1q28gm9/las_terrenas_restaurant_report/,Las Terrenas restaurant report,"Just got back from four days in Las Terrenas.  First time for us in the DR, so this is a purely tourist view.  We are family of 5 with 3 teenage kids.  Our aim was to find good food, walkable from our AirBnB, nice setting, focus on fish/seafood.  Here is where we ended up and our thoughts, in order of our trip.

Sol Y Sombra - Good food, decent cocktails, very good service but was relatively expensive.  Cost us 12,000 DOP for starters, mains and a cocktail each.  Accepts credit cards.

El Kiosco -- Beach side lunch, connected to the Costa Arena Beach Hotel (we were not staying at the hotel).  The food was excellent, our best meal of the trip.  But it took a LONNNNNGGGG time for the food come.  Like 90 minutes.  The family next to us, who appeared to be Dominican, were also waiting a super-long time (so it wasn't just us).  But eventually we went for a swim (its on the beach!) and when the food arrived we ran out of the water to our table and enjoyed some amazing Dorado al Coco, Camarones and other treats.  Cost was 5,500 DOP.  Accepts credit cards.  Would go back in a minute for that seaside Dorado.....

Casa Azul -- Went for dinner one night, recommended by our host.  It is REAL DEAL thin-crust pizza with fresh toppings.  Solid cocktails, great setting on the beach, efficient service.  Just good all around.  6,000 DOP, accepts credit cards.

Empanadas y Mas -- Ended up here for lunch one day after some false starts (showed up too late one day, next day they didn't open).  It was excellent.  The chef whips up empanadas on order, so they are all freshly made.  And we had 2 types of ceviche which were both super-fresh.  Laid back vibe, tiny place (only 10-12 seats in the place).  It was great.  Cost was about 3,000 DOP, cash only.

Restaurante Dulce Playa -- Located in one of the beachside restaurant stalls near the town center.  Food was excellent.  Enjoyed Dorado, Lambi, Pulpo, cevice, etc.  Service is made to order, so it's not quick.  But who cares when you're sitting on the beach with a drink enjoying a warm evening! Cost was about 5,500 DOP, cash only.

Paco Mer - Also located in the beachside restaurant stalls, just down from Restaurante Dulce.  Food was good, similar to Dulce's plus some Italian-inspired dishes. Great appetizers, well-made cocktails.  Very attentive service.  Cost was 9,000 DOP, credit cards accepted.

Cafes -- There is still a cafe culture in Las Terrenas.  We hit 2 cafes for morning coffee & treats.  Boulangerie Jean located next to the Supermercado Linda was excellent -- great coffee, flaky & buttery croissants, shaded & quiet patio.  Really great, but unfortunately a hike from our villa.  Boulangerie Francaise is located right in the town center and has a nice covered patio.  The coffee is good but the baked goods are not as superior as Jean's.  But Francaise has a wide selection of baked goods and I got a bagful of treats to bring home for the kids and for lunches, which is a big plus.  Both cafes are cash only. 

Hope this is helpful for your visit to Las Terrenas.  Also, a plug for JM Transfers who provided transfer for us from SDQ.  Flawless execution, good communication, reasonable cost.",4,1767383021.0,Dominican,0,1.0,False

I’m a Twitch streamer, and for three years, I had a moderator who slowly became a huge source of stress and emotional drain.

What really opened my eyes were the constant jokes when I played games like Tears of the Kingdom, Pikmin 4, and FF16. He joked obsessively about cooking Koroks, Pikmin, and Chocobos and turning them into messed up food dishes. He joked about how he thought Chocobos were just oversized chickens and proceeded to make jokes about how he thought all birds were chickens. He wanted revenge on fictional characters for hurting villains he called his husbands. He was genuinely upset when I defeated Ganondorf and even fantasized about Link and Zelda being sent into space. Everything had to be dark, hostile, or provocative.

After a breakup, he refused to move on. He villainized his ex and constantly trauma dumped. He was so bitter. He claimed to have been hospitalized after attempting to harm himself, though parts of the story didn’t add up. Other people told me they never felt comfortable around him because of how heavy his trauma dumping was. He even did it on my birthday about a family death. Moments that should have been neutral or joyful were always redirected back to him.

He thrived on stirring drama and got satisfaction from provoking others. He hijacked my streams and made them about himself, including custom commands mocking me whenever I made a mistake. He dismissed everything I said and ignored boundaries. He made lewd comments about fictional characters and flipped my healthy choices, like switching to sparkling water, into something wrong. He bragged about his coffee intake and fixated on hating Christmas and fantasizing about burning Christmas trees. He had bizarre habits like eating Kit Kats by scraping all the chocolate off with his teeth or taking a full bite instead of breaking it apart. Even small things became exhausting.

Being around him was draining, and I believe dealing with him contributed to my depression.

Looking back, much of what I was shown was distorted or manipulative. The patterns mattered more than the stories themselves. Every joke, every drama, every boundary he ignored was part of the same exhausting cycle. But I walked away. I reclaimed my space, my energy, and my peace. I set boundaries, spoke up, and chose myself over someone who constantly drained me. That relief, and knowing I am no longer trapped in that cycle, is more real than any lie I was fed.

I finally cut him off back in August, and the relief has been immense. People have thanked me for speaking up, saying they felt safer afterward. I am reclaiming my voice and my life. For anyone dealing with someone charming on the surface but emotionally destructive underneath, your experience is valid. Walking away is not cruelty, it is self-preservation.

1q28dux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q28dux,Met an weird person near UCLA — can’t tell if I overreacted or dodged something,"This happened on the afternoon of December 30th. I was waiting for a bus near Westwood when an older man, probably in his early 70s, started talking to me. The first thing he asked was whether I was a UCLA student. When he found out I was an art major, he introduced himself as a filmmaker and said he had once given a lecture at Luskin.

While we were talking, my bus arrived. He clearly noticed, but didn’t seem to want to wrap up the conversation. Out of politeness—and because r12 runs pretty frequently—I stayed and kept chatting. Then he suddenly asked if I wanted to walk a block or so to a nearby coffee shop so he could show me a script he was planning to turn into a TV series.

At the time, I didn’t think much of it. I didn’t have plans that afternoon, so I agreed.

On the walk over, he talked a lot about himself and said he was working in five different fields at once: writer, producer, photographer, astronomy enthusiast, AI researcher, etc. He also mentioned that the next day (the 31st) was his birthday. I wished him a happy birthday and casually asked what he was doing for it. He said he wanted to see a movie, then asked about my birthday.

Throughout this, I genuinely saw him as a very talkative, slightly eccentric but humorous older guy with a lot of interests. He mentioned he was originally from New York and had a studio there. When I asked what he was doing in LA, he said he had an intern at UCLA and that someone had “just dropped him off here.”

When we reached the coffee shop, before even going inside, he struck up a very animated conversation with an elderly couple sitting nearby. They had just met, but he was already chatting with them enthusiastically, handing out his name card and exchanging contact info. Since he had invited me and said he’d buy me coffee, I didn’t refuse.

Once we sat down, he pulled out a few stapled pages of a script and started explaining the story to me. The script was set around the Vietnam War era, and combined with his somewhat old-fashioned vocab, I honestly had trouble following it. I mostly just smiled and nodded politely. After the opening, he changed the subject and asked what I was interested in and if I had any questions for him.

I asked what area of AI he focused on. This turned into a long monologue about his views on AI and the future, very pessimistic overall. He claimed that around 70% of jobs would be replaced by AI, that governments wouldn’t actually provide the jobs or benefits they promise, that developed countries would inevitably race to colonize Mars, and even said Katy Perry had secretly paid to go to Mars (he added that he knew more but “couldn’t say”). He also said AI should be regulated at the UN level, similar to climate change.

By this point, I had been talking with him for close to an hour and had been fully engaged and polite the whole time. He then mentioned that if I didn’t have plans the next day, we could meet again to chat with “totally no pressure.” I didn’t respond directly and changed the subject. During this time, he kept complimenting me, saying I was very open-minded, that he admired me, and repeatedly emphasized that he already considered me his “friend.”

Later, he asked about my art practice. I showed him some of my work, including a short film. I casually mentioned that I liked film too. He suddenly became very excited and said that since he had a lot of interns at UCLA, he’d be happy to mentor me.

At that point, the conversation started feeling off. Even a very generous person usually wouldn’t make that kind of offer to a student they just met, especially someone who isn’t even a film major. But I also felt awkward outright rejecting him, so I didn’t give a clear response.

He then talked about introducing me to people in the film industry, showing me the full production process, and even name-dropped Spielberg. After that, he said he was planning to see a movie called Marty Supreme at 7 p.m. the next evening at the Laemmle Film Center in Santa Monica and asked if I wanted to go with him. He added that the theater manager knew him and that there was a chance (not guaranteed) they might display his photography there.

He asked me to look up the theater and showtimes on my phone. I saw there were three screenings the next day—1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 7 p.m.—and casually mentioned the 4 p.m. one. He immediately said, “No, it’s the 7 p.m. one.” Internally, I really didn’t want to say yes. But since I had already deflected some invitations earlier, the conversation was already deep, and I’m very familiar with Santa Monica, I ended up agreeing. He then started planning when we’d meet in Westwood and take the bus together.

He also repeatedly mentioned that he liked playing mini golf, that he used to go with interns, and that he planned to play regularly every week in the future, asking if I’d be interested. I declined each time, saying the new quarter was about to start and I’d be busy.

Not long after locking in the movie plan, he packed up and suggested leaving. As soon as we stepped outside, he ran into another older couple walking their dog and immediately started chatting, promoting his book, petting the dog, taking photos, and exchanging name cards.

It was only then that I realized he had never given me his name card. For my person safety, I was planning that when I got home, I wanted to look him up, so I messaged him asking for one. He pulled a card out of his pocket and said he’d give me “the best-designed one.”

I complimented the card and asked if he designed it himself. He proudly said yes. But earlier, when I showed him my work, he wasn’t familiar with many basic digital art or design concepts and kept emphasizing that certain well-known designers were people he personally knew. So out of curiosity, I asked what he used to design the card. He just smiled and didn’t answer.

On the way back, he kept saying things like “you really made my day” and “thank you for trusting me.” When we got to the bus stop, I made an excuse to leave. He said, “See you tomorrow.”

Once I got home, I immediately regretted agreeing to the movie. I realized I had been internally resisting the whole time, but I’m really bad at saying no, so I kept compromising. Since I had his name card, I started looking him up online (everything I found is from public sources).

Online, he does appear to be a legitimate and accomplished photographer who has worked with celebrities and published books, mostly consistent with what he told me. But something still felt off, mainly for these reasons:
	1.	His public bio online was almost a condensed version of our entire conversation—his parents’ jobs, childhood trauma, interest in space, connection with Armstrong, street photography, ballet photography, mini golf, etc. Every single thing I wanted to verify was already there.
	2.	When we first met, he mentioned lecturing at Luskin in a way that made it sound like he was a regular speaker, but online records show he was a one-time guest speaker promoting his book back in 2022.
	3.	He didn’t give me his name card initially and avoided explaining how it was designed.
	4.	He repeatedly thanked me for “trusting” him. I’ve gotten enough scam calls that this specific wording makes me uneasy.
	5.	He kept pushing to meet again the very next day, like chatting, mini golf, and a movie.
	6.	Inviting someone you met the day before to spend your birthday together is, at the very least, unusual.

I debated this all night and talked to several friends before deciding to cancel the movie and email him the next day. I know this situation can be interpreted in different ways, but from a personal safety standpoint, it didn’t feel right.

At the same time, I didn’t want to ruin his birthday if he really was just a welcoming person. I even prepared a small birthday gift and wrote in the email that due to a sudden work conflict (which I had mentioned multiple times during our conversation), I couldn’t go to the movie, but if he’s available, I could meet him an hour earlier at the agreed spot to wish him a happy birthday and give him the gift.

Over an hour later (the night before he had replied almost instantly), he responded with an email (pic 1) that was openly accusatory—saying I was inconsiderate, needed to meditate on myself, and completely ignoring the gift I mentioned.

That email basically confirmed my gut feeling that something wasn’t right. I genuinely don’t understand the mindset of someone who expects to build “trust” and make one-on-one plans with a stranger they met less than a day ago. And I can’t reconcile the polite, humorous, “no pressure” version of him from the day before with the person accusing me of having poor character in that email. Some friends think he might just be emotionally unstable and very rude.

In the end, I didn’t go. After reading that email, I felt that not responding at all was already the most graceful way to handle it. Still, I can’t stop thinking about it, which is why I’m writing this post.

Sorry this is a long ass post. But I tried to summarize everything that happens on that day. If anyone happens to know this person, I mean no offense. From my perspective, everything felt overly deliberate. I truly hope he’s just a regular person who felt disappointed by a stranger canceling. But if this situation could have gone in a worse direction, I hope this can serve as a reference for others.",1,1767382847.0,ucla,14,0.53,False
1q28deu,https://i.redd.it/gk3um3q4ozag1.png,"I built a small iOS app — building it was fun, getting users was much harder","I wanted to share a quick reflection on a side project I recently launched.

Because of a health condition, I have to stick to a pretty strict diet — no coffee, no alcohol, no gluten, no sweets.  
I tried a bunch of habit and “bad habit” trackers to help with that. Most of them were fine technically, but none really worked for me long-term. Not because they were bad apps — they just leaned heavily on discipline and tracking failures, which didn’t help much when motivation dropped.

So I decided to build something for myself.

I made a small iOS habit tracker with a virtual pet.  
The idea was simple: instead of pressure, use emotional motivation. If you stay consistent, the pet is happy. If you slip up, it reacts too. That emotional layer turned out to work much better for me than streaks or warnings.

Honestly, building the app was the fun and relatively easy part.

What I didn’t expect was how hard marketing would be.

I tried a few things:

* organic posts on Reddit
* short videos on TikTok and Instagram
* small paid experiments with Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit ads

Some videos even got decent views and engagement, but installs stayed very low.  
It was surprising how big the gap was between “people saw it” and “people actually went to the App Store and installed it”.

I’m attaching a screenshot from App Store analytics just to show what early traction realistically looks like.

The project didn’t feel like a failure — but it was a very clear lesson that:

* shipping is only the first step
* distribution is a completely different skill
* attention doesn’t automatically turn into installs

For now, I’m treating this as a learning experience and continuing to experiment.

Just wanted to share an honest snapshot of what the early days of a small side project can look like.",1,1767382819.0,iosapps,0,1.0,False

1q28bfl,https://i.redd.it/2obaelx5ozag1.jpeg,"🌱🚽 BREAKTHROUGH: ""Soylent Brown"" & Carbon-Negative Cooking Oil - From Toilet to Table in 24h","


TL;DR: We've developed a system that converts human waste into high-quality protein powder (""Soylent Brown"") and premium cooking oils using graphene-doped carbon aerogel technology. It's carbon-negative, uses plasma sterilization, and could revolutionize urban food systems.

---

🤯 THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT

The Process:

```
Toilet Waste → Carbon Aerogel Pyrolysis (800°C) → Plasma Gas Upgrading → 
Resublimation Purification → Food Synthesis → Soylent Brown & Cooking Oil
```

Key Technologies:

1. Graphene-doped Carbon Aerogel - 2800 m²/g surface area, captures 99% of nutrients
2. Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalysts - Convert methane to protein precursors
3. Atmospheric Pressure Plasma - Sterilizes AND upgrades molecules
4. Temperature-Graded Resublimation - Produces 99.99% pure compounds

---

📊 WHAT WE CAN PRODUCE (Per 10,000 People Daily)

Product Daily Output Equivalent To Market Value
""Soylent Brown"" Protein 150 kg 300 kg soybeans $750/day
Cooking Oil (Olive-like) 100 kg 500 olive trees $300/day
Essential Oils 5-10 kg Lavender field $500-$2,000/day
Clean Water 9,000 L -- $450/day
Phosphorus Fertilizer 10 kg Critical mineral recovery $20/day

Total Daily Value: ~$2,000 (for a town of 10,000 people)

---

🌍 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT (Mind-Blowing Stats)

· Carbon Negative: -2 kg CO₂e per kg protein produced (vs. +15 kg for beef)
· Water Positive: Produces MORE clean water than it consumes
· Land Use: ZERO agricultural land needed
· Phosphorus Recovery: 95% of this critical mineral saved from waterways
· Methane Elimination: No more sewage plant emissions

---

🔬 HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM HISTORIC ""RECYCLING""

1. Not ""night soil"" fertilization - This is molecular-level breakdown and rebuilding
2. Pathogen Destruction: Plasma + 800°C pyrolysis = 100% sterile
3. No ""Eww Factor"": Starting molecules are CO, H₂, NH₃ - not recognizable as waste
4. FDA GRAS Status Possible: Using existing novel food pathways

---

💰 ECONOMICS THAT ACTUALLY WORK

For a 100,000-person city:

· Investment: $7M (with 50% green subsidies)
· Daily Revenue: $20,000
· Payback Time: ~7 years
· Jobs Created: 50-100 high-tech positions

Compare to Conventional:

· Beef protein: $15-20/kg (needs 15,000L water/kg)
· Our protein: $2-5/kg (produces 900L water/kg)
· Olive oil: $15-30/L (needs 5,000L water/L)
· Our oil: $3-5/L (produces water)

---

🎯 POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS

1. Space Colonies: NASA already researches waste-to-food (but ours is better)
2. Climate Refugees: Rapid deployment food systems
3. Cruise Ships/Luxury Yachts: Zero-waste prestige
4. Military Operations: Secure local food supply
5. Climate-Positive Cities: Urban carbon sinks

---

🚫 ADDRESSING THE ""ICK FACTOR""

We get it. The mental hurdle is real. But consider:

· Coffee beans come from bird poop (Kopi Luwak)
· Premium olive oil from goat-digested olives exists
· Mushrooms grow on manure
· Your vegetables are fertilized with sewage sludge

Our system is MORE hygienic than conventional agriculture. The pyrolysis breaks everything to atoms and rebuilds food molecules from scratch.

---

🧪 CURRENT STATUS

TRL 6 (prototype demonstrated in relevant environment)

· Lab-scale: 1 kg/day operational since 2023
· Pilot plant: 100 kg/day under construction (Munich, Germany)
· First commercial: 2026 target (Singapore water system)

Partners: Two EU universities, one German wastewater utility, and a Swiss food safety lab.

---

🤔 PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION

If we're going to have 10 billion people by 2050 and need to reduce agricultural land use by 50% for reforestation... what better solution exists?

We either:

1. Continue deforestation for agriculture
2. Accept recycled nutrient systems
3. ??? (Magic doesn't exist)

💬 LET'S DISCUSS!

Questions for Reddit:

1. Would you try ""Soylent Brown"" if it was 1/10 the price of whey protein?
2. What naming/marketing would work? (""Urban Protein""? ""Circular Nutrition""?)
3. Should cities MANDATE nutrient recovery from wastewater?

I work full time M-F, so you may not see me often. Most of the time, I come home and take a nap after work to relax, so I tend to be pretty quiet and keep to myself. In my free time, I like playing video games, driving around to explore, karaoke w my friends, napping, or traveling. I go out maybe once or twice a month, but depends on finances lol.

I’m looking for roommates that like to keep the shared spaces neat and tidy and hope you’ll do the same! Don’t mind guests, but if you have someone staying for a while just give a heads up. I’m also gay, so hope for roommates who are lgbtq friendly :)

Hey, I’m CJ! I’m a 25-year-old male currently working in the marketing industry. Past roommates would describe me as easygoing, considerate, and likes to keep things clean and tidy. I value having open communication with my roommates to make sure we are on the same page about the shared spaces to work out any differences or issues before it gets too out of hand. On weekdays, I work from home on Mondays and Friday, and in-office for the rest of the days. On my free time, I like to explore new foodie spots and areas, go to the gym, test out new receipes, and catch up on some shows or books that are on my list. I’m currently relocating from Miami, FL, so I’m excited to meet new people and become good friends from being roommates!

 The sharp dinging from Robin’s phone alarm was enough to wake him up. His fingers took on a mind of their own as they went right to the email app after turning the alarm off. There were two unread emails indeed waiting for him: one confirming the reception of his job application, and another thanking him for his application, but unfortunately letting him know he would not be moving in the application process, both were unrelated; the last 50 emails in Robin’s mailbox oscillated between confirmation of application reception, and “regretfully” letting him know he wasn’t moving on in the process of the respective position. Needless to say, the expectation of these emails had been fully incorporated into Robin’s morning routine.

The next place Robin’s fingers decided to check out was the job board. He found a job he could have sworn he applied to just the other day, but upon cross checking with the thousands of jobs in his “applied” list, it was nowhere to be seen. He finally found an excuse to dig himself out of bed, just not yet though. His laptop pestered him, trying to leer him over – he found a new job he could apply to, and this may just be the one, but the bed took on a more realistic tone.  “This *could* be the one, but weren’t the other 400 jobs you applied ‘the one’?” His bed reminded him as Robin found himself readjusting his blanket on him rather than taking it off so he could get up. 

Hours went by - the sun had now painted the walls of Robin’s room a bright golden shade. Reluctantly, he took this as the final plead to get out of bed, and start his day, at 6 pm. While he was out of bed, it took him another two hours to make his way over to the kitchen and prepare himself his breakfast – a burnt slice of toast with poorly spread cream cheese, and instant coffee that gets cold way too quickly. Amidst the uncertainty of ever securing a job, he would rather have the consistency of burnt toast than bring on any sort of change. He sat at his desk at last, 9 in the evening, ready to dreadfully apply to the job he picked out when he woke up.

To Robin’s surprise, he had a resume perfectly ready for the job he was about to apply, and yet after a second round of going these applied jobs, he had never applied to that specific job. The resume already seemed to be aligned with job description, there was no point of going through it again with a fine-comb brush as it would only take away time from him feeding his hamster, Dusk, and dig himself back into his bed. Still, it took Robin another half hour to simply submit his application that he had no plans to changing anyways.

Robin meandered back into his room to feed Dusk. The excitement with how Dusk ran on the wheel was contagious. For a brief moment, Robin imagined himself as Dusk – running endlessly on the wheel and forgetting everything else. He’d have nothing more than the closure of eating and running on his fun, little wheel, no mortgage to worry about, no jobs to worry about, no income to worry about – simply eating, sleeping, and exercising. After feeding Dusk, taking another solid two hours through his very minimal night routine, Robin wrapped his day up.

Okay, onto editor Rob Malone's commentary! Once again, I so connected with the periods of time in which Rob would go quiet during it. It's always so hard to talk for 90+ minutes straight, especially when you're doing a commentary by yourself.

Rob also gets up and gets a drink (this time coffee) during the commentary, echoing the same move Patrick did during his.

He had previously worked on the *Chris Gethard Show* (both the public access and cable versions of the show) which was very fun to learn, especially as clips from the *Chris Gethard Show* end up making it into the doc.

Oh boy, I also connected with Rob when he started talking about his blu-rays and 4Ks that he owns and how he gets excited seeing special features, especially commentaries - same brother. He specifically mentions recently ordering *Kindergarten Cop* on 4k and discusses how *Home Alone* on 4K was one of the last ones that Fox released before being taken over by Disney.

He got involved after getting an email from (who else) Patrick discussing the project and offering him the possibility of editing it. 

Rob briefly touches on the process of editing the film. Annamaria and Ryan had an assembly document before he started which he worked off of to cut the film. Like Ryan, he mentioned that the opening was very difficult to cut and his earlier version of it had more intense music and was more fast paced. And he discussed going through the hours of interviews and grouping clips from them into batches that had the same theme or discussed the same topic. 

And he gives some of his thoughts on the state of modern docs (bemoaning them for cutting too quick because he likes to let things play out) and that he thinks when you get a laugh in a documentary from the editing, that it's kind of a cheat. 

Rob also mentions that his favorite scene in the film was the planning session at Patrick's place. 

A Couple Fun Facts:  
\- I've never met Rob but apparently he's a friend of a friend and I didn't realize it. My film school buddy Corey Stevens (who's also an editor in the industry) commented when I logged Rob's commentary on Letterboxd that he knows and has worked with Rob a bunch of times and vouched for him being a cool dude.  
\- He began editing the doc in 2021 and had another full time job as he was working on it for about three years which made it a little challenging.   
\- He never thought he'd be editing documentaries but enjoys it now that he's done it. And he mentions both the good thing and the challenging part of docs is that there's so much footage with them.   
\- At the time of his commentary recording, he had squirrels in his walls and was worried they could be heard during it. 

Okay, that's it for now! I'll be back early next week with the next commentary. ",9,1767382371.0,GeorgeLucasTalkShow,2,1.0,False

The problem is that while Getting guys is still comically easy-I can open an app and hate a date within minutes if I’m not too picky.

She decided I also said it was an option that she could say goodbye to him or they keep the friendship and we become friends but she chose to say bye to him, but she then said to cut off someone I worked with because apparently she flirted with me and I did too, but nothing had ever happened and she is double my age however attractive but still, and then she was in her hometown of Bulgaria and there was a guy friend that was gonna give her a two hour drive one to one with her and I said I wasn’t comfortable with it, so she didn’t do it however she made me cut contact with my uni friend because I once had a crush on her however nothing happened. She has also head butted me when drunk, pushed me into a wardrobe and this morning threw the milk plastic cap at me because I drive her about places and she will get me a coffee etc instead of petrol etc, however since she saw a couple of months ago with the woman that was double my age messaged me cos she realised I had cut her off, my girlfriend checked previous messages and saw kisses etc however in these messages we were both saying how happy we both were in our relationships, whilst kisses which I understand is wrong however when we had discussion about coffee and why she is not getting me one, as I would go Starbucks with her in car to drop her off she would only get her self one, not me, the morning after we spoke about this she was making us both one but from home and I said funny now your making one from home isn’t it and she shouted at me and through a plastic milk lid at me and said stop giving me a headache I’ll whether it’s me or her or both….

1q283wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q283wv/was_he_being_entitled_and_presumptuous_or_have_i/,"Was he being entitled and presumptuous, or have I misread this situation?","  
I am a 36 year old woman and for the past couple of years I've been ""online friends"" with a group of about 5 people, we post on a social media platform about music, mostly, and share jokes and so forth. I became closer friends to one of them, a man aged 64, talking on WhatsApp about our friends, families, daily life etc.

This continued without incident for several months - the man would occasionally compliment my selfies, but I assumed he was doing so in an avuncular fashion. He said he would be in my city in early January and would I like to meet up for coffee - I said great, that would be nice.

He then texted (in response to a humorous video I'd uploaded which features me) ""You look fab, and I'm looking forward to our date.xxx"". I was aghast to read this, as I have NEVER shown any romantic interest in him, and because of the 28 year age gap assumed he wouldn't even think about romantically pursuing me.

It made me very uncomfortable - I replied in a breezy way something like ""It will be nice to meet up - been ages since I had a good catch up with a friend"". The next day, however, I completely got cold feet and texted to say that I am very busy this month and cannot meet after all due to work commitments. He replied passive aggressively about having made arrangements ""but never mind"".

I want to text to say I found it alarming that he would text that we were going on ""a date"" when we had never agreed to a date, nor even used the word. I did consider if I'd misunderstood, but then again as it was suffixed to a compliment (""you look fab, and I'm looking forward to our date.xxx"" plus the passive aggression when I gave reasonable reasons I couldn't now meet, makes me think I understood him perfectly.

Is it a good idea to give up looking for jobs in my field and try to work at the coffee shop. Will it change my view on cafes if I begin working at one. I find that sometimes you shouldn’t work in things that are leisure in your life. But I also think it would be a good learning experience too. I hope to open my very own coffee shop in a few years and I started the planning for it. I’m also currently in school again and use this time off to move through school quicker. I know if I start a full time office job again I will probably have to go back to normal pace.

I became closer friends to one of them, a man aged 64, talking on WhatsApp about our friends, families, daily life etc. 

This continued without incident for several months - the man would occasionally compliment my selfies, but I assumed he was doing so in an avuncular fashion. He said he would be in my city in early January and would I like to meet up for coffee - I said great, that would be nice.

  
He then texted (in response to a humorous video I'd uploaded which features me) ""You look fab, and I'm looking forward to our date.xxx"". I was aghast to read this, as I have NEVER shown any romantic interest in him, and because of the 28 year age gap assumed he wouldn't even think about romantically pursuing me. 

It made me very uncomfortable - I replied in a breezy way something like ""It will be nice to meet up - been ages since I had a good catch up with a friend"". The next day, however, I completely got cold feet and texted to say that I am very busy this month and cannot meet after all due to work commitments. He replied passive aggressively about having made arrangements ""but never mind"".

I want to text to say I found it alarming that he would text that we were going on ""a date"" when we had never agreed to a date, nor even used the word. I did consider if I'd misunderstood, but then again as it was suffixed to a compliment (""you look fab, and I'm looking forward to our date.xxx"" plus the passive aggression when I gave reasonable reasons I couldn't now meet, makes me think I understood him perfectly.

This unit is light enough at about 12 lb and small footprint wise it fits where a coffee machine would, so compactness and portability are legit strengths.

Ice production speed is the main selling point and it mostly delivers: first batch really does show up around that 6 minute mark for 8 bullet ice pieces, then it cycles steady. Capacity and output feel “small household” not “team party,” since the basket is only around a big tumbler or so before you need to dump it into a freezer bag. Suitability for gatherings depends on babysitting it, because ice retention capability is the weak spot. This is not a freezer, the ice cube quality ends up wet, half melted, and sometimes clumped, since meltwater drops back into the water reservoir and gets remade. That constant loop can mean more compressor/fan runtime, and yeah, I expect it’ll show on the electric bill.

Two sizes of bullet ice are handy for cocktails vs. water bottles, though bullet cubes melt faster than real clear cubes, that’s just physics. Noise level is decent, not silent, but I’d call it “kitchen background” and not obnoxious.

Ease of use is straightforward: fill reservoir, hit start, watch through the viewing window. Control panel usability is simple and digital, but I still dislike these cramped membrane style panels long term, spilled water and greasy fingers happen. Water reservoir size seems generous enough that refills weren’t constant, every day or two in my case.

Self-cleaning function works as a rinse cycle, not a miracle. Cleaning and maintenance still means dumping, wiping mineral film, and running citric acid now and then. Ice scoop and basket features are fine, basket is a basic lift-out, scoop is the usual plastic deal.

Price to performance feels fair compared to other portable ice machines in this size, not “cheap cheap,” but reasonable if it lasts. Durability over time is the big question: I’ve seen folks get 2+ years of heavy daily use, and I’ve also seen at least one horror story where it came back from storage making loud noise and tiny chips. Customer service experience sounds sketchy in that case, warranty help was basically a runaround.

Anybody else here run this model for a full year plus, and did the compressor or pump start acting up?",1,1767381824.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

A soft click from the hallway at night, like a light switch being tested and changed back. I assumed it was the building settling, or my neighbor coming home late. Old apartments make noises. You learn to accept that.

Then things started moving.

My keys were no longer on the hook by the door but on the kitchen counter. My shoes were aligned neatly under the bench, toes pointing out, the way my mother used to insist when I was a child. I live alone. I am not neat.

I checked my carbon monoxide detector. I read articles about sleepwalking, dissociation, stress. I was working too much. That explanation felt comforting.

The first thing that scared me was the mug.

I only own one chipped blue mug. It was in the sink, rinsed, placed upside down to dry. I had not washed it. I distinctly remembered leaving it on my desk the night before, ringed with cold coffee.

I stood in the kitchen for a long time, listening. The apartment smelled faintly of lemon cleaner. I do not own lemon cleaner.

I installed a camera in the living room, pointed at the door. It felt dramatic, but it helped me sleep. For two nights, nothing happened.

On the third morning, I woke to a notification. Motion detected at 3:12 a.m.

My hands shook as I opened the clip.

The footage showed me entering the apartment. Or someone who looked exactly like me. Same posture, same slight limp in the left foot. He removed his shoes, aligned them carefully, hung the keys on the hook, paused, then turned toward the camera.

He looked directly into it.

He smiled, the tight, polite smile I use with strangers. Then he raised a finger to his lips.

The next clip started an hour later.

The camera showed the living room empty. Then the bedroom door opened. I watched myself step out, blinking, disoriented, wearing the clothes I had fallen asleep in. I stood there, staring at the empty room, confused. After a few seconds, I rubbed my face and went back into the bedroom.

I woke up moments later, heart pounding, the phone buzzing in my hand.

I did not sleep again.

That night, I stayed awake with every light on. At 2:47 a.m., I heard the click in the hallway. Slow footsteps approached the bedroom door. They stopped just outside.

A familiar voice spoke softly through the wood.

“You can sleep,” it said. “I’ll take care of things.”

The handle began to turn.

I realized then why everything had been getting cleaner. Why my emails were answered. Why the bills were paid on time. Why I felt so tired lately.

Someone had been living my life for me.

I bought a knock off chemex a few years back to use when we go camping with no electricity. It works well and provides coffee but I never “nerded out” with it. 

Currently we use a Nespresso Vertuo coffee maker… yeah yeah I know lol. I’m looking at possibly getting more into coffee and moving on from Nespresso but don’t want to give up the automation and assistance it provides. We don’t really need a batch brewer but having the option is certainly not a negative. We survive with the Nespresso just fine, but I might use the batch option for us if it’s there. 

Regardless which one I’ll need a grinder. The fellow can be bundled with the opus for $497 and of course the studio is all in one at $599. Either way, it is a steep barrier to entry and a little off putting. 

I’m interested in the idea of playing around some but also want simplicity when desired especially for the wife as I would imagine she has no interest or desire in having to fiddle much with the coffee maker. She would prefer simplicity and no adjustment necessary. 

I’m kind of over the Nespresso pods, however I do like the coffee that we get. So moving to another pod brewer is… kind of meh. But it changes the experience and you don’t have to use pods with the studio.

1q27sdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonLadies/comments/1q27sdg/finding_friends_fr/,Finding friends fr,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 24-year-old Indian woman who moved to London about four months ago for university. Today was my birthday, and I realised I don’t really have anyone here to celebrate with. It hit harder than I expected, so I thought I’d finally write this.

I’m at uni, but it feels like most people already have their groups, and interactions stay surface-level. Everyone is polite and friendly, but not really open to forming genuine friendships. I miss having someone I can hang out with casually, like unplanned coffee, random walks, or just talking about life without it feeling forced.

I’m naturally empathetic and optimistic, but I’ve been taken advantage of in the past, which makes me a bit guarded and introverted at first. I still really value meaningful connections and would love to build at least one genuine friendship here.

If anyone else has been through this phase in London, or is currently in the same boat, I’d really appreciate hearing how you navigated it. And if you’re also looking for a real, low-pressure friendship, feel free to comment or DM. Even knowing I’m not alone would help.

Hello Fellow Nerds,  
a few days ago I posted the alpha version of my game: [Cricket Manager 25](https://cricket-manager.com/) which a lot you all seemed to enjoy and pointed out a few suggestions and bugs, but a lot of you were also unable to play it because Airtel had falsely flagged the website. All of the bugs and the false positives has since been rectified and this release would be the first stable release of the game. The game has **No ads, sign-ups or downloads and is completely free-to-play**. enjoy!  
  
the official secure URL for the game is: [https://cricket-manager.com](https://cricket-manager.com)  
  
Note for Players: Please use the ""Feedback"" button in the header if you encounter any bugs or have any thoughts about the game. and please feel free to criticize! It would greatly help me to identify things to improve upon

**Note for potential collaborators**: As mentioned earlier, I am a sole developer and would love to have more hands on deck, be it for UI/UX, Gamedev, Marketing or anything else at all. Please note that the game is meant to be open source and there is no monetary incentive apart from donations (which will be 100% funnelled back into the game). I strongly believe that a collaborative project would be the best way to make the game grow and my DMs are open to anyone else who sees the potential of the game and would like to help out in any way possible!

Dear mods, this is not any spam or promo❤️ It's a fun free no sign up required game. Please approve",2,1767381437.0,Cricket22,1,1.0,False

I have the plant in 3 different environments (pictured) and with varying levels of watering, but all are experiencing this wrinkling and curling. I love this plant very much and need advice on how to improve things. All of these are from cuttings and have rooted.

Picture 1 - White glazed ceramic. This one is near a south facing window next to two coffee plants that are thriving. This one is probably the most neglected in terms of watering. I have cinnamon on the soil to try and discourage the fungus growth and the fungus gnats

Picture 2 - submerged in water 24/7 (I need to transplant!) and on a north facing window

Picture 3 Huge pot with fresh potting mix (so nutrients should be good) I have a clay ollas at the center to ensure a consistent and even amount of watering. It is in the living room where it has access to bright indirect light.

All 3 plants seem to have the same problem. The leaf coloring is a little off, but Marosa leaves often can be neon pink so the color isn't the strangest thing.",1,1767381430.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False

• sessions always go at least 30+ minutes over (he only charges for 1 hour)

• he's given me old clothes of his and some things related to a shared hobby we have (he didn't buy anything new... was just getting rid of stuff and thought i would like it) he also gave me a christmas gift this year

• he does a lot of self disclosure. always relevant and helpful to me but his personal life is certainly no mystery to me...

• lets me email him whenever and usually responds within a few hours. i also have his personal phone number (but i think he gives this to everyone)

• i was out of state for like 7 months and couldn't see him for therapy but we stayed in contact the whole time i was gone via email. He also called me one time when i was going through it and we got coffee while i was back in town once

• i made a playlist that i shared with him and add to regularly

• i am in a really rough place currently. like lots of suicide attempts and i think im making him really worried… i guess for good reason… but he’s mentioned that he wishes i lived with him so he could like monitor me, has sent me texts really late when he knows im having a bad time (i usually get suicidal at night), and almost showed up at my house when i didn’t respond right away … 

• he's also referred to me as a ""favorite"" of his 

i know all of this probably seems a little crazy but um some things in defense of him: we are both trans men. it's hard to be trans in the US rn. we live in a red state.... i think there's some trauma bonding due to the current moment. i think he feels sort of protective of me (im like \~late 20s, he's like 50). I think he likely ""gets"" something from the relationship in the sense that i think he likes to care for people but i don't like... provide anything to him emotionally. It's very one sided in that sense.

i have honestly no one in my life that im close to besides him and i love him a lot but part of me is kind of like... what is wrong with him?",0,1767381415.0,TalkTherapy,9,0.5,False

Three attorneys and their paralegal are chilling in the break room getting some coffee. 

Suddenly they start discussion who is the best for the firm. 

The litigation attorney says,  ""Well, God spoke to me and said litigation is the best department. We have attention to detail, work under deadlines, and help people in need.""

The M&A attorney says,  ""That's funny, because God also spoke to me, but said corporate work is the best. Corporations make our society function and benefit way more than just 1 person, especially when corporations hire hundreds of people.""

The elder law attorney scoffs. ""Estate planning and admin is best. God spoke to me a long time ago, and that's why I chose this area. Not everyone builds a company, and not everyone gets sued in their life. But everyone dies.""

They all look to the paralegal, hoping they would break the tie.

1q27nwh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q27nwh,Winter Day Journal — 2nd Jan 2026,"Wake-up:
Today I woke up at 10:00 AM—yes, very late. Winter mornings make it extremely hard to leave the bed. Eventually, I was woken up by Gauri and her dad.
Morning:
After waking up, I had my syrup and made myself a cup of coffee with some peanuts. I told Nani that I would eat batti chokha in the evening, but she brought it immediately, so I had to eat it then. It turned out to be a very heavy breakfast, and my stomach felt completely full.
Work & Learning:
I went to my room and did some work. Today, I researched DevOps and tried to understand how frontend, backend, and databases connect—not in depth, but enough to get a basic idea. I plan to go deeper this week.
I also need to start with the MERN stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, and Express. After that, I watched some podcasts featuring Nikhil Kamath and Elon Musk.
Lunch & Afternoon:
By the time I finished, it was already lunch time (even though I woke up so early 🙂). After lunch, I got back on my PC, but my room was extremely cold. I couldn’t focus on anything, so I went back to bed, masturbated, and slept around 5:00 PM.
Evening:
I woke up around 7:00 PM, had another cup of coffee with Parle biscuits, and then went out of the house. I took Bhumi for her injection, and after that, we went to the park. I did a really good workout there and felt great.
Night:
After coming back home, I got on my laptop again. I registered for a hackathon and learned that I have to attend a startup meet tomorrow. I also had a call with Prashant.
Then I had dinner. After dinner, Bhumi made me buy chocolate to try making grape-coated chocolates. However, she added milk to the chocolate, making it too thin, so the grapes didn’t coat properly—the experiment failed. We then used the remaining chocolate to make chocolate milk.
End of the Day:
I went back to my room, read Metamorphosis, and now I’m writing this journal under the blanket.
Overall, the day was decent, but it felt like it ended before it really got started. Still, I’m confident that I’ll work more and wake up earlier than today.",1,1767381223.0,u_Solid-Firefighter888,0,1.0,False

1q27jnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1q27jnf/i_26f_am_at_a_crossroads_in_my_relationship_with/,i (26F) am at a crossroads in my relationship with my husband (26M) and wondering if i should be contemplating divorce. is the grass really greener?,"this stories history dates back a full decade. i will have to sum up a lot of things but will do my best to give you a broad understanding of the pickle i am in. apologies for this being such a lengthy read. all responses are appreciated!

my husband (26M) and i (26F) got married about a year and half ago. our liking for each other started way back in middle school however, we didn’t start dating until our sophomore year of high school. we broke up in the summer after our junior year but started dating again almost immediately after graduation in 2018. we have been together ever since. totaling 9 years of dating history together.

we go through ups and downs like all relationships but recently we had been doing really really well. we spend a lot of time together and always have. i would definitely consider us to be best friends. our work schedules are opposite on W T F & S of the week but we still see each other for a minute in the morning on those days and always say goodnight. we make sure to reach out to let each other know we are thinking of them on the days we don’t see each other much.

the saturday before christmas was an especially good day for us. even though he was at work by 6:30am and by the time he got home i was gone for work and wouldn’t get home until after 11:00pm our day was filled with super flirty messages between each other. i offered to bring him a coffee to work but he said he was ok. later on, when i was at work he ended up visiting me and hanging out for a while. he told me to wake him up when i get home because he wants more time with me. i rushed to get out of work and headed home about and hour and a half later.

he was asleep in bed and wearing nothing. i started rubbing his back and trying to gently wake him up. he can be a deep sleeper so after about two minutes i headed back downstairs without getting him to wake up. the neighbors were having an ugly sweater party and wanted us to stop by. i grabbed a bottle of wine to bring them and before heading over thought i would try and wake up my husband one more time. he didn’t wake up. but this time i got a weird feeling like something might be off… i lifted the covers to find the beginning of the crime scene: he had …finished and was in the process of cleaning up but must have passed out. at first i thought it was kind of funny and maybe hot ? he was clutching his phone. i tried to grab it out of his hand but he magically and instantly awoke.

quickly realizing what i had just stubbled upon, he did a kind of alligator death roll to try and cover his tracks. i started to calmly ask him what he had been up to for the last hour and a half since he saw me. he started falling back asleep which i can only assume he was pretending to do to avoid the situation. he wouldn’t answer any of my questions and was giving me the full silent treatment. he then got up and hurried to the bathroom taking his phone with him. i followed him. still remaining incredibly calm. i was not raising my voice or being demanding. i was just asking him “did you jack off?” and “please can i see your phone?”

at this point he is nude and on the toilet. any time i ask him a question he pretend to start to doze off and fall asleep. i know he is pretending now because the only question he will answer is “babe are you awake?” ..all other questions are met with silence.

i asked probably 100 times for a good duration of time (at least 30 minutes) before i was done getting played and started telling him he needs to come clean or else… the more serious side of me lasted about 30 more minutes before he finally started to talk.

i was worried he had been messaging other women which had been a part of our dating history in our beginning years. but i am so done feeling like i have to snoop through phones and i really thought we had worked out all of that chaos years before we got married.

turns out dude wasn’t messaging any women but he was looking up porn on reddit incognito mode. now… i know what some of you are thinking. that’s it?! just a little porn? it wasn’t even anything crazy or weird. it was just simple searches. HOWEVER from day 1, i have always made it a clear boundary that i don’t want that as part of my relationship. my parents marriage ended because of many reasons, but a big one being that my father had a wild porn addiction. following their divorce i lived with my dad. he would openly watch porn in the living room and eventually started getting into other SA behaviors. i love to get down and dirty but watching other people have sex is a huge trigger for me. so i don’t watch it. and i don’t need it in my space.

the crazy part is my husband met me shortly after my parents divorced and started dating me when my father would openly engage in porn at home. he has seen the trauma happening first hand and knows exactly why i have that boundary in my own relationship. (this feels like the biggest betrayal)

another huge concern for me is the way he played me like i was dumb (probably out of panic but still) wild behavior. if i had not caught him i would have never known. he was definitely trying to evade me and wasn’t willing to start being honest until i reminded him that he made a vow to me.

i was really mad, of course, with the new cards i was getting dealt and at the time he was drunk so i told him we are spending the night in different beds and can talk about it sober tomorrow. we have never spent the night in separate beds because of a conflict. this was a first for us.

he didn’t respect my space for the night. calling my phone, texting me, knocking on my door. and when he would talk to me he would act all mopey and almost baby-like. this only annoyed me more and i eventually told him if he can respect anything right now, let it be my space. the next day i was too emotionally exhausted to have the talk. i had done about 9 hours of driving, plenty of crying, and no eating. i called one of our mutual close friends who is a dude, because i wanted a mans advice on this one. we talked for about 3 hours and he advised me to take a nap before trying to have the conversation. i did. and didn’t wake up till morning. i also told my husband i don’t want to sleep alone so we slept in the same bed that night.

he was gone to work by 6:30am the next day but we talked for a good 30 minutes before he left for work. i did feel like he was taking the time to let me get all my thoughts out and not rushing me by worrying about being late for work. i appreciate that but didn’t want him to get fired so i told him to go. i told him i need him to be ready for our talk when he gets home. i need him to handle like the man of the relationship. handling it with honestly, full accountability, every detail, the timeline of things, and the why’s need to be answered.

when he got home, we talked. for a long time. and a lot came up. the conversation remained super civil. voices weren’t raised and i feel like he was answering all my questions with honestly and handling the situation how i asked him to. one thing that concerned me and really hurt my heart is that he said he said he has a problem with viewing porn. that was a big shock to me because i have been oblivious to it all.

i asked him why he got me to marry him knowing fully well that he still lies and deceives me and what good does it do to tell me the truth once i am so emotionally invested? almost as if he knows i won’t or can’t walk away. i asked him why he thought that was fair? and why this deceit is a pattern of behavior. he always comes clean to me about things but it is always after i move states with him, or get a house with him, or marry him…. once i am already locked in.

the conversation ended by us agreeing we need to ask ourselves what we love more than each other. does he love not putting his shoes on the shoe rack more then he loves me? does he love not picking up the dog poo more then he loves me? does he love watching porn more then he loves me?? big things, little things. ask it! and that goes for the both of us. we also agreed we are wanting to work through this and stay together.

then christmas came and we had to socialize with a bajillion people and pretend like everything is all good and dandy. he has been putting in a lot of effort to take me on dates, by me flowers, send me sweet texts, get the house cleaned, and so on so i feel appreciated and like he really wants this and is trying. but i can’t help but still want to just punch him in the face sometimes. metaphorically of course.

right now i feel like my whole marriage is a sham and i have been played by another person i let get close to me. i really truly feel alone in this situation. and i feel like i was never given the chance to make my own decisions because i was never being given the truth. i am trying to fall back into wanting my husband as much as he is showing he wants me but i am mad.

to make matters even worse i now am wanting to reach out to an old “friend” just to see where life has taken him these days. he would have been someone i would have most definitely pursued if my husband and i didn’t get back together in 2018. once committing to my husband back then i unfriended this guy on all social media platforms and have not been in contact with him since. when i got engaged, he tried to send me a facebook friends request. i never accepted.

i think me wanting to reach out stems from wanting to know what could have been or what is out there now if i did decide to end my marriage. not saying that is the decision i am going to make but a part of me feels like i owe it to myself to see what all the possibilities could have been because i was never actually given that chance to make the decision before.

but also… reaching out to someone you haven’t talked to since you guys were 19 years old after so many years is kind of cringe.. right? and i would have to tell my husband i am wanting to do that or did that …right?? because i am also wanting honesty and that would then be hypocritical of me.

i just want to say hey and see if he is in a relationship and how dating went for him over the years. not saying i would then pursue this guy but ask him “what’s up?” so i get an idea of what the world is like? i haven’t dated anyone else besides my husband in 8 years and the person i was interested in before that was THIS guy.

are my feelings valid?! am i on a different planet and need to come back to earth? if we fix this now how will i know that i am actually getting honesty in the future? how would i survive a divorce? do i even want a divorce? is my husband a great guy but also just an idiot? is this how relationships go???? what would you do if you were me

Universe sometimes shows you signs interms of repeated number(11:11,11,22 etc).
There was a girl that i liked so much when i was working a job and she was a model and a makeup artist and her studio was in front of my office and my office was in ground floor and her studio was in 1st floor and my office had a glass as most do where i can see everything on the outside but you cannot see on the inside and from the first day at work ,i was so in love(instantly she became my crush)  like i used to watch her everytimes she came out of studio but she was a model and a makeup artist and ofc i thought she is out of my league and its normal to think like that cause it was a fact but then i remembered that i am also a powerful manifestor and had an instinct of manifesting her cause whenever i saw  her,i felt something that i never felt before .So i started doing different thing ,figuring out different stuffs but at the end i created my own visualization which i already shared in recent post and then i kept the practice going and limiting belief was strong but i was overcoming and overcoming and i was shifting even though i saw no changes but boom suddenly one day what happened was i usually take my lunch break at 1 but that day i was so full from the morning that i didnt thought of eating but at 2pm ,i suddenly wanted to go to a cafe and have a coffee and usually i used to go to same cafe cause i was introverted at that time to try out different place but that day,i felt like going somewhere else so i went somewhere else and entered there and then she was sitting there and i said hi randomly and i sat infront of her as she was alone and i asked her where is your friend and  she said to get her parcel and she will be back afrer sometimes and then we had a great conversation and we exchanged numbers and i forgot to ask her socials and i was so excited and happy ...

 the syncronicity(sign of manifesting her) is that we exchanged number on 30th december 2023 and we didnt talked that day but she called me another day and said to accept her fb request and i was unaware of her fb request cause i only use fb simetimes and lol i login through website so i was unaware and then i quickly accepted her fb request and it was exact (10)pm when we started talking at 31st december and then she said she was most active in insta and i didnt have insta as i was traumatized by it cause i had a breakup there so i wasnt using it and she said to download insta and i agreed and i logged in to my quotes sharing account where it had (11) posts and 0 followers and 0 following and i followed her(1)  and she followed me back(1) and when she said hey on insta then it was (11:10) and when i replied it says (11:11) and she said lets make a wish and i prayed for our deep bonding and relationship and then we texted and texted and it was 12am( jan 1) ,2024 which was new year and also her birthday is in june and mine is in may and when we subtract it ,we get (1)and the signs and pattern repeated in 1 like crazy and from observing  birthday ,i hit her with a rizz : may minus june is 1 and maybe its because you were the 1 i was searching for and i still remember this line that i said and she loved it so much and then now we are soulmates ,have deep loving relationship and i know what you guys are gonna ask ...i manifested her in 17 days as i was also working on my deep concept to make my sp to  stay with me for the rest of my life and thats how a love alchemist was born and then i started helping people to manifest their love life.

Notes: dark blanket is for the pup.. it’s our compromise so she can be on the couch with us, not a design choice.

The flavors are realllllly good. The minty ones especially are great, the spearmint doesn't taste like dip mint, it's true mint, if that makes sense. ( I don't like how other brands minty flavors remind me of dip)

Some mild complaints - they are moist, which is fine, but all the filling of the pouch is packed hard to one side. You have to work it in your fingers or teeth to break it up, or you're putting a rock in your lip. 

Also noticed immediately they burn a lot. Zyn/on has that refreshing quick burn/tingle, these are like... wow that burns... wow... and it still burns... a lot. The burn lasted the entire pouch, rather than fading like other brands after the initial tingle.

Also, the coffee pouches are flipping MASSIVE. I wish they didn't do that. Makes it obvious you have a pouch in your lip.

1q27d1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q27d1f/somewhere_beyond_the_sea/,Somewhere Beyond the Sea,"My grandfather practically lived in the ocean. The sea called to him, uttering sweet songs of promise and peril, and he answered, fishing rod and bait in hand. There wasn't a day where he wasn't drenched in the sea or carried its scent with him. There would be times when I would visit him during the summer and he would just get inside his own house after fishing for a while. He wasn't at all a frail old man and he was probably more physically fit than other elderly people I have met, yet he did have his moments of weakness.

Our neighborhood was built along a cliff facing the water, so whenever my grandfather needed to get his fix of sea salt, all he would need to do is walk out his back door. I always lived down the block from my grandfather, so going to his house was only a matter of deciding whether or not to take two minutes out of the day to go and visit him. My parents never cared how long I went to his house. I could have been at his house for a year and they wouldn't care. But the amount of time he spent out at sea disturbed them. It wasn't unheard of to go to the beach by the cliff side. It was normal to play around in the sand, make sand castles, and watch them get wiped out by waves, mocking you with the slightest bit of sea foam that followed it. But something about the frequency and how he would talk about the sea felt unnatural. He was family though, and that was enough for my parents to trust him.

I remember the first time he took me out to the ocean like it was yesterday. It was in the summer and my parents were out of town for the night. My mom had to stay the evening shift at the museum and my dad's boss decided to give him overtime at the office. Sure his wife worked evenings often, but this was a fantastic opportunity to squeeze more work out of him like a soggy rag. I remember walking to my grandfather's house with a big smile on my face. I always loved going to his house. Though in hindsight, I feel he was a bit weird and off-kilter. But as a kid, he was possibly my favorite person to be around. He had a huge back yard that I would sometimes bring some toys with me to play in. There was this wooden fence with a gate that prevented me from accidentally falling off the cliff side and I would always try to take a peek over the fence. My grandfather, being the responsible babysitter my mother always relied on, always made sure to keep me from tipping over, and would sometimes instead have me sit on his shoulders to see the view of the vast sea that he visited almost every day.

He had this fire pit in his backyard that we used to make s'mores in at night. It had a shoddy setup of old metal foldable chairs, rusted by the wrath of the atmosphere. But despite that setup, we made it work. He would always tell stories of giant fish he wrestled with in the ocean and of maidens singing beautiful ballads to him. Every fish that he caught, there was a story behind it. Every wave he rode was an adventure. Every sound was a song. I would always look forward to listening to these stories and he would always be looking forward to telling one. This particular story was about how he saw this giant fish that he found swimming in the middle of the night. He didn't catch it yet, but he plans to go out tonight. I would always ask him if I could go with him, ever since I was four. Usually, he would say that I was too young. But this time, after he finished his story, he said, ""So kiddo, I told you this story because I might need some help catching this one. I think you are at the age where you can help me. Would you like to help me catch it?"" I was ecstatic. I practically fell out of my seat. ""Yes! Yes I do!""

""Alright, let's go!"" He picked up his fishing gear and started to leave towards the cliff side.

I jumped up from my seat and followed him with a huge grin on my face. We made it to the fence and went down the rocky steps formed by the cliff side. As soon as we made it to the boat, my grandpa took both oars and rowed with all his might. I asked if he needed help, but he assured me he got it. It took several minutes before we went out to the ocean away from land. I could see the entire cliff side from the water. 

My grandfather closed his eyes and took in the evening breeze. “The beauty of the ocean is the silence. There’s no arguments or interruptions, just the sounds of the waves. It feels safe. Almost like a blanket. And now, kiddo. I think you should be able to experience this with me, too.”

I couldn’t agree more. The ocean was peaceful. No wonder grandpa came out here so often. My grandpa stood up, threw his hook into the water, and sat back down. He then offered me the fishing pole. “The fish won’t catch itself.”, He said with a smile. I snatched it with excitement and almost started reeling in as fast as I could. My grandpa’s words stopped me, “Not yet, wait for a bite.”

“How will I know when the fish bites?”

“When it tugs on your fishing pole. You should also see the tip of it bend more. Focus on the rod itself.”

I then squinted my eyes and “focused” on the fishing rod harder. My grandfather laughed. “This isn’t a competition, Sam. Just feel the breeze. Save your energy for the fish.” 

I closed my eyes a bit and breathed in the sweet scent of the ocean. I felt the waves rock the boat ever so slightly and felt the soft breeze gently push against my face. It all felt still, safe. Suddenly, a yank from the fishing pole. I jumped up. My grandfather kept me steady. “You got him! Now reel! Reel! Pull away from the fish!”

I did as he asked, I gripped the fishing rod with iron resolve and pulled away from the fish as I furiously reeled the line in. It was hard, but luckily my grandfather was there to root me in the boat. I kept cranking the reel, my noodle arms wiggling from the stress I placed on them. “Hey grandpa! This must be a big one!”

“It must be to give someone as strong as you a problem!” He laughed at his own joke.

I pulled, I reeled, I yanked and cranked. It wasn’t budging. Suddenly, I felt my grandfather pick me up. I kept on reeling, and pulling with all my might. The fish flew out of the water and flopped around on the boat. My grandfather quickly picked up the creature and wrestled with it until it stopped. And there it was. In my grandfather’s arms was a striped bass. It was huge. The thing passed beyond his shoulders. He could take someone out with it. This was the fish of his legend.

“Nice catch, kiddo,” He said with a smile, still trying to get the fish to stay still. 

Once we gave the fish the time to stay still, he dropped the fish on the boat, looked at his watch and said, “Woah, look at the time. It is time for bed, kiddo. Do you want to do this with me again? I can get you your own fishing rod if you would like.” My eyes widened, “You mean it?”

“Yeah, why not?”

That was probably the happiest I have felt in a while. I got to live the adventures that my grandpa spoke to me about. “Yes! Please get me my own fishing rod!” My grandpa smiled and pat my head, “Sure thing, kiddo.” 

After a few hours of being out at sea, my grandpa took both oars at hand and rowed back to shore. Once we got back to the house, my grandfather told me to wait in the living room for dinner and so I turned on his old “flat screen” TV to \*Avatar the Last Airbender\*. He never wanted me to see him gut the fish, thought it would be too much for a ten year old to witness him cut open a fish carcass and watch as the innards spilled out. I could still remember the thick, metallic scent of fish meat intermingled with blood coming from the kitchen as he whistled the song, \*Beyond the Sea\*. His whistles kept in time with the harsh scraping sounds he made with the knife as he cut into the flesh of the fish. Once he finished dicing up the remains of the titan, he stored them in tiny little containers and kept them in the freezer. The next few days we had bass for dinner. I surely didn’t complain, mostly because I knew in my mind that I helped catch it.

For the rest of the summer, it became routine. Every afternoon, I would visit my grandfather and we would go out to sea. Then, when it would get dark, he would place a lantern on the floor of the boat and tell his stories out in the middle of the ocean. His stories seemed much more real when he told them out at sea. I felt that I could imagine them better. That I could put myself and his shoes and actually feel the light evening breeze at the sea that he would rave about. I could feel the rocking of the boat and even imagine what it was like to man a boat in the middle of a storm. It all just clicked. And whether or not we caught a fish didn’t matter much to us. It just felt right. Just to go out to the ocean felt worth it. 

By August, the fantasy was over. I had to cram my Summer Reading assignment before the school year started, so I stopped going out in the ocean with my grandfather. Instead, I would just read my book in his living room, alone. During the first few weeks of school, my time was so limited with homework and projects that I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had been neglecting my grandfather. Whenever he would ask me if I wanted to go out into the ocean, I would be so busy that I just had to say no. And I can still recall that every time I declined his offer, he looked as if he felt hurt. Like I had rejected him, rejected the sea. I felt a bit sorry for him, leaving this old man to go out to the sea alone again. So, I decided to go out with him for one day during the weekend. Homework and projects be damned, but I wanted to spend time with my grandfather for a little bit. So, the next time he asked, I gladly put my books down and went out with him.

Though this time I went out to the ocean it was different. It felt different. It felt alien. Like I wasn't supposed to be there. The wind felt sharper, more cold. The sea felt more rough than relaxed. My grandfather was stone faced the entire time he was rowing us out to sea. I would constantly ask if he was alright or if he was tired, and he would always answer that he was fine, that he felt great, even. He would ask me about school and I would tell him, though I still couldn't shake the feeling of something different that might happen. He pulled out his lantern and placed it in the middle of the boat. Then he stood up as if he were to tell me a story again. But this time it was different. This time, he got up and said, ""You know, the ocean here missed you Sam.” 

“What?”

“The ocean misses you. You were gone for too long. I could hear it calling to me. It was asking where you went.” 

I was puzzled. Why would the ocean miss me? I tried to force a laugh to see if my grandfather was joking. He wasn’t. He was dead serious. His face contorted with fury, “You think this is a joke? You abandoned our friend like that, and you think this is some sort of joke?” His voice escalated with every word that left his mouth. You could physically touch the scorching hot rage boiling inside of his chest. My throat dropped to my stomach. “G-grandp-?” 

“It’s not very nice of you to abandon our friend like that, Sam! And to laugh at her grief too? What’s wrong with you?”

The waves matched his fury and rocked us both violently as I held onto the side of the boat. My grandfather started to get closer to me. His giant hands snatched my shirt like two giant bear traps and tried to lift me up. I held onto the boat for dear life not knowing what he would do when he lifted me into the air. My ten-year-old strength failed me and he started to hold me by my shirt. He brought me close to his face. I could see his blood-shot eyes and the veins popping out of his neck. His breath smelled like an awful combination of coffee and rotten fish. Then he spoke through his gritting teeth.

“Do you hear her?”

“W-what?”

“Do you hear Carol?”

I shook my head. Then suddenly, something switched inside my grandfather. His veins were no longer bulging out his neck, his bloodshot eyes stared beyond me, but his vice-like grip remained tucking at my shirt. The waves also calmed down. Everything was still. The slightest breeze sent a chill down my spine. He slowly let me down and sat down in his seat, still staring into space. Then, realization kicked in. He looked at his hands in horror and looked at me. He reached out to me. “Kiddo…” His voice shook. “I’m-” 

I recoiled to the back of the boat. We stared at each other in silence; the only sound that was heard was the light rolling of the waves. Any slight movement my grandfather made, my grip on the boat tightened. He grabbed the oars and slowly started to row us back to shore, trying to make no sudden movements to startle me further. As we were slowly cruising towards the shore, the air felt sour. I felt sick, like I could hurl off into the infinite sea. Once we made it to shore, without saying a word, I jumped up and ran towards my house. I ran inside, ran upstairs to my room and shut the door violently behind me. 

I couldn’t sleep. As the night went on, all I could do was stare at the coat hanging behind my door, praying, hoping my grandfather wasn’t going to slam it open. The coat just hung there, and I could swear the sleeves were stretching and creaking their way towards me. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t get up. The sleeves started to slither on the ground towards me like snakes. The ends of the sleeves  reached towards me as it started to climb onto my bed. The claws of the coat were getting closer and closer, I think I could feel them pulling at my shirt, trying to make their way towards my neck, then suddenly, day broke. The coat was normal. My room was illuminated by the harsh, bright light shining through the window behind me. The birds chirping and the sound of the sea, beckoning me to come back to the waters. 

My eyes were wide open, but I still felt tired. I sluggishly got out of bed. I have never felt the weight of not sleeping until I got up that morning. My head was pounding, every move I made felt sluggish and I fought every urge I had to go back to bed. It was seven in the morning. I had school today. I got dressed, dragged my feet down the stairs and slowly made my way to the kitchen. I took out a box of Frosted Flakes from my cupboard and poured the cereal into my bowl as the golden, sugary grains made ringing sounds against the ceramic. I then dragged my feet to the fridge, pulled out a gallon of milk, and carefully poured the milk into the bowl, watching the grains drown in the liquid, completing my sugary soup. As I shoveled the cereal into my mouth, I brought all of my attention to the clock, seven-ten. I still have some time. My bus came by the house at eight-thirty, so I felt I had plenty of time. I shoveled more of the sugary substance drowned in milk as I made mental notes in my head about what I was missing. I’m clothed, and my backpack should be by my-. My backpack. I left it at my grandpa’s house. The sooner I realized it, the sooner I quickly dropped my spoon into my bowl and rushed out the door towards his house.

I stood there at his front door. I was frozen. The wooden titan loomed before me. I could see myself in the brass knob, pale and disheveled from a lack of sleep. Struggling to bring my hand towards the door to knock. Why am I so afraid? This was my grandfather. He would never hurt me. But, last night felt like an exception. Last night was the first time I ever feared the old man. Fear. That word and my grandfather even as a concept together felt like it would never be. Like water and oil – they never mix. But all it takes is a little shake. All it takes is a disturbance and the two can seemingly meld together.

I swallowed what fear remained of the old man and promptly knocked on the door. I waited a few minutes. Nothing, not a sound. I knocked on the door, louder this time. Nothing again. I tried to twist the doorknob. It was locked. I didn’t know what time it was now, or how long I was standing there. All I knew was I needed that backpack.

I rushed to the right side of the house and tried to open the giant wooden gate before me. It was locked. I hoisted myself over the fence and dropped over the other side into his backyard. It felt foreign. The grass blades of his back yard flowed in the wind and almost looked as if they were breathing or feeling for my presence. I slowly walked towards the back sliding doors of the house. As I drew closer, I was hoping my grandfather wasn’t staring before me or worse, waiting for me at the open doorway. I hid myself along the side of the house and looked towards the backyard. I found him. He was blankly staring off the cliff. He seemed to be out of it. I slowly tiptoed towards the sliding doors, keeping an eye on him so that he wouldn’t surprise me. I kept going, thinking about each step that I took, making sure that I didn’t make a sound. My eyes constantly shifted between pointing between two places, my grandfather and the wide open sliding doors.

I eventually made it inside and my nostrils were attacked with the metallic scent of blood and fish. I usually expected this smell from this house but this time it seemed stronger, like he recently gutted open a fish. I continued towards the living room where I left my backpack and there it was. I slowly made my way towards the backpack and headed straight for the front door before I heard the sliding doors shut followed by the feeling  like a quick rush of wind from behind me, bursting through his bedroom door. I quickly looked behind me. Nothing was there. The door was closed, and suddenly the house seemed darker. My attention was pulled toward my grandpa’s room. Illuminated by a small, dim, light. A voice in my head screamed, “Get out of there! What are you doing?” But my body seemed to move on its own. 

I slowly tiptoed my way towards his room. The smell grew stronger. The closer I got to the doorway, I swear I could hear something get louder. The sound of sobbing. I got closer and closer to the door as the sound got louder and the stench grew stronger, practically holding my nose in a chokehold. I held my breath and pushed onward and found my grandfather’s bedroom. In disarray. Books on the floor, pages torn out. Heads, fins, innards of fish strewn all over the floor. And above his headboard were the words:

I CAN STILL HEAR HER. HER SONG CALLS TO ME.  

EVERY TIME I DON’T ANSWER IT GETS LOUDER.  

THE SIREN GROWS RESTLESS.  

THE SEA CALLS TO ME.  

IT SPEAKS.  

THE SEA SPEAKS

repeated over and over again written in rotting fish entrails and blood, some of the intestine was sliding of the wall and obscured the other messages. I could still hear the sobbing, even louder this time, easing its way out of his bathroom door to the right. I tiptoe closely to the door, careful to not stand on any loose floor boards as the sobbing gets louder and louder. I peek into the room and finally see him. His hands were drenched in the blood and mucus of whatever he just butchered, cupping his hands around his ears. 

“It won’t stop.”

“The song won’t stop.”

“I can’t stop it.”

“No matter what I do I hear her.”

My grandfather slowly curls onto the floor, uttering the words, “Make it stop… Make it stop….”

He kept sobbing. Though I was horrified by him, I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. I tried to extend my arm to him from the creek in the door. Before suddenly, the door creaked open. My heart ran to my stomach. My grandfather’s head bolted up and looked right at me. 

“You…”

I jumped back and ran for the door. I heard him scramble onto his feet and follow behind me, howling

“YOU DID THIS TO ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT!!!”  

“YOU ANGERED HER—THE SIREN!”  

“THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR PUNISHMENT, NOT MINE!!!!”

I burst through his bedroom door and scrambled down the hallway. I could hear his footsteps getting closer. I ran into the kitchen before he picked me up with my backpack and turned me around. I tried to slip out of the straps before his bear-like claws snatched at my neck, squeezing tight. I could feel the air getting trapped in my lungs, all the blood rushing to my head. My hands tried to pull his hands away from my neck, but nothing, they wouldn’t budge. My right hand rested on the bloody mess that was his countertop. I tried to feel around and—got it. His knife. Without a second thought I shoved the knife into his shoulder right. He howled in pain before letting go of me. I dropped to the floor finally taking in air again. My grandfather sobbed more wildly, holding the knife in pain. I raced for the front door. I heard my grandfather’s sobbing quickly turn to shouts of rage as his footsteps got louder behind me. I unlocked the door and ran outside, shutting the door behind me. As I ran away from his house and towards mine, I thought I may have heard a squeak on the floor and a thud against the door. 

I rushed towards my front door before being confronted with my mother. “Where were—”, She gasped. “What happened?” She quickly grabbed me by the shoulders to look at my neck, covered in whatever my grandfather was butchering. “What is this? What happened to you?” My heart sank to my stomach. Tears were welling up in my eyes. I sniffled and said, “There’s something wrong with grandpa.” My mother, no questions asked, rushed to the phone and called called nine-one-one. She stated on the phone that he fell. She then called work and told her that she was going to be home today, that something happened. She put the phone down after saying, “Thank you.” and quickly got me into the bathtub. 

For the rest of that day, all I could do was stare into space, imagining how safe the ocean was with my grandfather. Imagining better times while my mother washed the blood and mucus that used to caked my grandfather’s hands. There were times where she held down the vomit from the smell that came off of it. My father came out of his room and passed by the bathroom door before exclaiming, “Ugh, what is that awful sme—”. His eyes grew wide as he saw his wife, practically in tears trying to clean off their dead-faced son. “What happened?” My mother told him how she found me, and what I said. Horrified, he went to the phone straight away to call off from work. This call, unlike my mother's, ended in a screaming match. He promptly told his job that he quit and hung up the phone. For the rest of the day, he did whatever he could to help my mother. For the entire time I was home, I was silent, staring into space while my parents were trying something, anything to get any words from me. They would constantly ask what happened, where grandpa was, what he was doing. All they got from me was silence.

Later that day, my grandfather was reported missing. They suggest foul play since the first responders saw what I saw in the house and found a pool of blood with a streak resembling someone who slipped in it sitting right by his front door. They also noticed some bloodied footprints that led out to the door, and out to sea. The case was never solved though. My grandfather was never found and his house was condemned.

Ever since then, I have been doing fairly well in school. I was a top student for most of my academic career, and since high school, I had a certain draw to marine biology. I was always fascinated with the ocean, so the field didn’t seem too far away from what I knew as my safe place. 

I went to university and graduated with a masters in marine biology. Saying that I made my parents proud was an understatement. Later that week, everyone in my family was invited to my house for my graduation. I was happy to see who had shown up, cousins, uncles I haven't heard from in years came all this way to congratulate me. It felt nice, but I couldn't help but notice that there was always someone missing whenever my family hosted some of these events. After a while, I felt I needed some fresh air, so I went outside to the beach into our back yard to just stare out into the vast ocean that was behind my house.

My mother came out the back of the house to meet with me, and asked if I wanted to join the family. I said, “I just wanted to get away from the noise. It’s quiet out here.” She nodded her head, ""Well, don't stay out for too long, everyone is here for you."", ""I know. I will catch guys in a bit."" My mom kissed my forehead, told me how proud she was of me, and turned back to the house to join the rest of the family.

After I stood out there and gazed at the stars, I noticed that a rowboat appeared to my right. That was weird, I haven’t seen that before. There was something in me that compelled me to go in, so I went in. I rowed out to sea, out to the spot my grandfather and I went fishing. The waves were calming, reflecting the night sky while rocking the boat like a cradle. It felt safe. I closed my eyes and started to hear something. Whistling. I knew the whistling sounded familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The longer I heard the whistling, it became clear to what tune it was whistling to.

1q279lm,https://i.redd.it/zcyfh0nn7zag1.jpeg,Random thoughts after a week with the XBloom Studio,"tl;dr - fantastic machine that mostly matches the marketing. A lot of room to become an even better brewer with a few more first party accessories and some app tweaks

Things I love

* It's not just hype. The xPods really are dialed in for the machine. When you're brewing standard pour-overs, maybe you get a banger 9.5/10 or 10/10 every so often and you spend the rest of your bag chasing that dragon. The xPods so far have been a pretty solid 9/10 with every brew. They're pricey, but they are all extremely good and consistent
* For single cup brews (brew volume aside), this is a far better brewer than the Aiden
* Brewing with your own beans takes a bit to set up if you want to go with a known recipe that works for you, but the setup time is worth it. Want a Tetsu 4:6 without the babysitting? The xBloom will run that playbook while you're getting ready in the morning. The Omni Dripper will tolerate 20g brews, which is my preferred dose, so no issues there
* Built in grinder is excellent, and reasonably high clarity. It's no Zerno Z1, but for your average weekday brew where time is scarce, it doesn't feel like you're compromising much
* The water line feed has been fantastic. I have a gallon jug of prepped water (using the TWW packet) feeding into the xBloom and it is way better than refilling the really small reservoir constantly

Things I hate

* 15g pods are really not enough coffee for me. Brewing 2 15g pods back to back works giving me a nice giant cup (but you go through pods 2x as fast). What I want is 18g or 20g pods
* Had to 3D print a negotiator to avoid too much bypass - would be nice if xBloom released an official negotiator with nicer materials
* Very limited clearance height for cups basically means no brewing into most thermal mugs. I'd be ok with that if there was at least room to put a normal sized server under there, but most won't clear. My Orea Z1 small server does fit, and just holds 2 xPods worth of brews at 1:16 ratio, so pick carefully
* App does not record past brews, and does not show brew yield weight. It's a small detail, but both are important to me for dialing in beans. There's already a graph that tells me they capture this already - just show me the numbers
*  It's really hard to experiment with the xBloom. Would be nice to have a mode in the app to let you easily take a recipe and tweak variables without committing it as a new recipe. Same stuff as you do when you do manual pourover. ""Let's try hotter"", ""let's grind a little coarser"", ""less agitation"", ""pour slower"", etc. And when the experimentation is done, then I want to lock that in as a preset to finish my bag
* Your water temp choices after 203F is BP. Granted BP is probably coming out closer to 208F or so, would be nice to have more temp variability after 203F
* I get the water line is really meant for pressurized feeds, so the 19 inch limitation for a passive water line hose makes sense. But I'd really love if there was hardware that would do a pressurized feed to the xBloom over longer distances. Like I want to keep my water jugs probably 5 feet away from where the xBloom is - I could probably cobble something together with a pump and the inline pressure regulator to make that happen, but how about a first party solution for those of us that don't have plumbing at our home coffee bar? 

End of the day, no real surprises here - the Studio has been out for a while. Hope they continue improving on it.",25,1767380363.0,pourover,19,0.9,False

I've had migraines since I was a kid and usually just took advil and coffee (didn't always help, but usually did). I can't take advil anymore because my stomach won't tolerate it. I saw my doctor for an alternative, and she prescribed me zolmitriptan. I tried triptans once twenty years ago (imitrex) and it didn't help. I had a migraine start last night, but upon reading through the potential side effects, I got spooked and decided I'd hit this one with tylenol, though tylenol rarely helps. I've also been drinking coffee. I drink A LOT of coffee when I have migraines (and am a regular coffee drinker otherwise) and have noticed there's a point where I can feel the blood vessels in my brain constrict (usually after 6 - 8 cups), and it's a lovely feeling when I have a migraine. Instant relief (not fully, but enough to function).

So my question is, if I tried triptans 20 years ago and had no ill effect, and if caffeine tends to help most of my migraines now, should triptans be safe and work for me? I'm aware my family doctor thinks this should be safe for me, but I'm mostly looking for reassurance. Also, I'd love for this migraine to go away fully. It's hanging in there.

1q278mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q278mo/portafilter_too_tight_breville_bambino/,Portafilter too tight [Breville Bambino],"Hi y’all. I’m new to espresso, but I found out something that might help with something I’ve seen mentioned a couple of times in this group.

I have a Breville Bambino. The portafilter is really tight and hard to get in place. I did a little bit of experimentation to figure out what was going on. I’ve tested it with out coffee in the basket and it’s still extremely tight. The next thing I did was pull the basket out and just put the porta filter in and it wasn’t very tight at all.  That made me wonder if it was mostly to do with the interface between the portafilter basket and the gasket itself.

Then I started to wonder if the portafilter basket having to twist on the rubber gasket was creating enough friction to where it was really hard to get the portafilter in. So I took a tiny bit of avocado oil on my finger and lightly oiled the edge of the porter filter basket that touches the gasket and I put the porta filter in and it went in nice and smoothly.

So I think this would probably apply to almost any machine where this is a problem.  Keep in mind that the amount of oil I used was super small. I lightly got oil on my finger and then just rubbed that on the edge of the basket. There wasn’t even enough for the basket to seem like it had oil on it. The other thing is it wears off after a time or two of use so it doesn’t last super long. I’m sure that over time this probably changes as the gasket gets broken in a little bit, but in case anybody’s struggling with it, here’s an idea that might help!",5,1767380305.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
1q277zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BWCA/comments/1q277zv/prepping_for_second_trip_into_the_bwca/,Prepping for second trip into the BWCA,"As we pass into the new year, and the time draws near to obtain a permit, I find it cathartic to write out my thoughts and then post them. Maybe someone will get some use, maybe someone will have some advice, you never know until you post, right?

Anyway, last year myself and 3 others took our first trip into the BWCA the first week of June. We had a nice split of skills - my brother and I are avid fishermen with little camping experience, and our friends are experienced campers with little fishing knowledge. We did 6 nights out in the BWCA and it was one of the best times we've ever had. We did really well with our packing for a first time trip, especially of that length, where we feel like we're on the cusp of single portaging. We're going to give that a better shot for our next trip (likely only 4 nights this time). 

A few things I learned from that trip:

Pack a better variety of food. I relied too heavily on peanut butter honey wraps and protein bars for 2 of my 3 meals a day. This next time I'll take some hard cheese, some sweet snacks, and less nuts and peanut butter. 

The fishing was so good that I think I can risk bringing just a couple packets of oatmeal as a backup dinner (or two). 

We lost far fewer lures to snags than I thought we would. If you're snagged, don't try and yank it out (rarely works), just paddle past the snag and tug it out from the other direction (almost always works). Leave less tackle in the water, and bring less with you - just a win/win. 

Plastic/Aluminum paddles don't work as cutting boards. I'll be bringing my own wooden paddle next time, just so I don't have to clean fish in weird spots. 

Knowing how to clean pike was a good plan - it tastes way better than smallmouth and we ate like kings with just a few fish. 

Doing dishes in the morning is lame. Bring breakfasts that aren't oatmeal.

Even after cutting the number of clothes down, I still had too many. It's not really weight that was a problem, but rather bulk, by cutting down slightly on my clothes bag it'll make packing way easier. 

Collapsible tubs were an MVP for us. Having two was a great call by one of our experienced campers. 

The Navionics App was nice to have a number of times. Worked great. Was also glad I had tethered my cell phone to my life jacket, because I almost lost it in the lake. 

My footwear was Neoprene Socks and Crocs for the entire trip, and will be for the next one. Putting the wet socks on in the morning was awful, but worth it. 

I never used the drift sock or the mosquito tarp, but I'll still probably bring both next time. 

Getting moving in the morning is one of the hardest parts. Even though we were awake early, my brother and I never went out to morning fish. This next time I'm bringing a jet boil to get coffee started early. The stove we brought in case of a fire ban was a Dragonfly and neither of us actually knew how to set it up and the other guys slept in, so we built a fire (no ban) and by the time we had it up, the coffee ready, and started to wind the fire down it was time to start moving for the day. 

Our group was 2 tents 2 hammocks, and we only came across one site the entire trip (and we stopped a few of them just to check them out) that we couldn't have made work. A fifth shelter of any kind would have been pretty tough in a couple of them. 

The wanderlust hit all of us pretty hard, which was surprising. The original plan had us base camping 3 nights in the same place, but we ended up changing the trip and only staying for 2 so we could see more lakes. 

  
Anyway, we're looking to get out early June again targeting Snowbank EP, this time for probably 4 nights. Covering some pretty decent sized water with this trip, so we might be forced into morning travels to avoid the worst of the wind.

We're just getting started on a remodel of our kitchen.  By just getting started, I mean, we have ideas and have talked to 0 souls with actual experience, expertise, or skills in this area.  I have some pictures here and some general feelings I have.

**How we use the kitchen:**

We do a lot of cooking, a LOT of baking, I like to have storage and prefer to have things out of sight if possible, don't like seeing a lot of cords, make coffee every day, sometimes just use the kitchen counter to work from.  It's a very central area in the house, but separated from the living area by a door and bedrooms by a hallway, then there's a large opening that goes into the sunroom

  
**Pictures:**

**My Ideas:**

* Peninsula (2nd pic) --> Island (I'm a bit torn here because the island will need to be pretty thin to accommodate for appropriate clearance on either side of it, but the peninsula is the bane of my existence).  Although I DO wonder if a shorter peninsula that is extended to the end of the wall the main part of the kitchen is on would work okay too.  The main issue is just having so much to walk around, but the secondary issue is I think we would just have more cabinet space and less hassle to access it without the peninsula.
* The upper + lower cabinets extend to the end of the wall on the left (2nd pic)
* Lower cabinets --> drawers
* Double ovens --> one oven under stove as stove/oven combo, center that on the wall it's currently on.  I'd love more room on either side of the oven. (2nd pic)
* Microwave moves altogether OR is just raised higher over the stove.  I really need more vertical space here one way or the other.  If I move the microwave, I'm not really sure where it could fit. (2nd pic)
* Sink moves in front of the window.  I'm a little torn here.  I generally like this better in every layout I see, and would love for a completely empty island.  The hard part is that this has been my prep area for so long, I'm kind of attached to it, and I don't know what working next to the sink or on the island would feel like... If it's too expensive, I may decide to keep the sink relatively where it's at on an island. (2nd pic)
* Upper & Lower Cabinets next to the fridge - gone.  Need room for a bigger fridge and this will allow more space for a wider pantry. (2nd Pic)
* Floors - will probably change.  The grout between the fake brick right now is really hard to keep clean (it is not, in fact, very clean, and I'm not sorry about that)
* Countertops - haven't really decided what I'd like.  I'm kind of a fan of the marble extending up the wall vs. tiled walls, but not sold on any of that yet
* Built in cabinets on the far wall for bar/extra storage for less used appliances, glassware, etc.
* Trashcans (3rd pic)- ideally we go down to just two trashcans from four (we have trash, two cardboard/paper/plastic recycling, one glass recycling) and can store those in some of the new cabinet space we're opening up in the kitchen proper.  This is the walkway to/from the hallway, and I'd ideally like it to be clear/maybe just some decorate shelving on the wall
* One thing that REALLY bothers me is how little light there is in that same corner on the far wall, with the table (1st pic).  I don't know how to accomplish getting more natural light in.  A window to the outside isn't an option, but maybe I could extend the entryway into the sunroom or add an interior window?  Maybe just better lighting overhead would solve the issue

**My questions:**

* Is there anything I should avoid?
* How do you know when you've found ""the"" company?
* Designer + outside contractor or company that can do both?  We have contractors we're considering and people who can build the cabinets/countertops, so I'm consider just working with a designer, but I can see how it would be a little more streamlined with a company that can do both jobs.
* Anyone have an opinion on how much this should cost?  I'm about to start getting quotes from companies, but it would be nice to know which ones are like out of the ""normal"" ball park.  I don't need the highest end appliances, countertops, cabinets, etc, just things that are built well and will last and aren't unsightly (although maybe that described expensive).",2,1767380252.0,kitchenremodel,1,1.0,False

Mia is in a polyamorous relationship (17m, 20f) , for 5 months.

Ever since the start of their relationship Mia has always said complained about it. Telling me about issues and fights she’d have with their partners. I’d always listen and offer her very general advice, not wanting to overstep, just telling them they should communicate.

Most of my comments are ignored, as Mia absolutely HATES confrontation. Regardless of how upset or sad Mia is she will refuse to bring it up to said person but others instead.

One day as we sat at a coffee shop and talked, I decided to be a little more blunt with my comments. Night’s previous to this I had made sure to educate myself the best I can on the polyamorous community, wanting to be as understanding and respectful as I can.

So after her long rant about her partners I told her in the most gentle and respectful tone I could, that if she truly had issues with her partners it’s her responsibility to be upfront and tell them. I told her that communication is already very important in a monogamous relationship and in a polyamorous one it’s importants doubles with every new relationship (something I had learned in a book so correct me if i’m wrong). 

After I spoke she blew up at me, telling me I had no place to say everything I did, that communication wasn’t something she was willing and ready to face, that I was being a bad friend and not supporting her when she needs it most.

I began getting a little emotional as she continued to berate me in the middle of the rather quite cafe and I just said “well you’re not mature enough for a relationship if you can’t communicate, let alone a polygamous one”. 

She turned red as she began to tell me off, telling me how my own relationship was going to end, how she was so much better thus getting two partners not just one, and a slurry of more insults. 

I go to leave, just wanting to cry in my car and go home as she says something along the lines of “yea well you’re not mature, that’s why your pdf boyfriends with you” (my boyfriend is newly 21 and we met when he was 20 and I, 18 at our school’s library). I made a bee line to my car as I knew some people were definitely looking at us. 

A few days passed and I reached out apologize for upsetting her, I was ignored and blocked. Worst of all she had told all of our friends my boyfriend was a pdf and I was a liar. A few of our mutuals knew she was lying and agreed that my conversation with her was a much needed one, while others told me it wasn’t my relationship and I shouldn’t have said anything. 

I’m starting to regret my conversation with her, as it wasn’t my relationship and I didn’t know the dynamics and differences within a polyamorous relationship. But I feel a part of what I said was true, relationships don’t work without communication.

For months now, my girlfriend has been on this epic quest for the ultimate morning espresso companion, a petite ceramic mug that's short in stature but boasts a generously wide diameter. Think of it as the Goldilocks of coffee cups: not too tall (so her shots don't get lost in a cavern), but just wide enough to let that rich aroma swirl and hit you right in the feels. She's got this super specific vision in mind, kinda like this rough sketch I whipped up based on her descriptions:

We hit the jackpot at this year's Christmas market, spotted *the one* that ticked every box. It was love at first sight... until we flipped the price tag: a whopping $70! Oof, our budget said ""nope"". We walked away heartbroken, but the dream lives on.

So, wise wizards of Reddit, I'm turning to your collective genius! Do you know any sellers, artisans, or shops that craft similar mugs? Bonus points if they're affordable and in Europe (under $30 would be a miracle), and handles are optional, we're flexible. Etsy gems, Amazon hidden treasures, indie potters, or even international spots with reasonable shipping? Hit me with your recs!

He lifts the tiny ceramic thimble, gives it a wry little salute—half mockery, half ritual—
—and downs it in one.

The world detonates.

Color explodes behind his eyes: violent auroras of crimson, gold, and void-black. Sound collapses into a single, deafening heartbeat.
Then—Silence.

He is no longer in the café.

He stands in space.

Before him hangs Novawolf Station.
Or what was Novawolf Station.

The great rings are shattered, torn apart like broken ribs. Bio-domes are ruptured, venting atmosphere into nothingness. Fires burn where fire should not exist, clinging to debris as if refusing to die. Wreckage drifts in slow, accusing spirals.
And around it—

Starfleet ships.
Dozens. Hundreds.

Cruisers. Dreadnoughts. Clean, precise, clinical. Their hulls gleam untouched, immaculate against the ruin they’ve made.

Weapons cycle. Shields hum.
Leeroy tries to move.
He can’t.

The vision forces him to watch.
The scene shifts.

Now he is planetside—streets he knows reduced to trenches, streets he grew up on. Wolves in uniform fall around him. Dale screaming orders. Kira dragging a wounded recruit. May bleeding out against a shattered bulkhead.

Gotham—
Gotham firing until her staff cracks, until her scream is swallowed by artillery.
Rhea roaring defiance atop a mountain that is reduced to glass.

The sky burns.
Starfleet insignia blot out the stars.

Another shift.
Leeroy is on his knees.

Armor shattered. Cloak torn away. Blood—his blood—floating in zero-G droplets around him. His hands shake, not from fear, but from exhaustion so deep it feels ancient.

A Starfleet admiral stands before him, pristine, calm.

“Stand down, Lord Commander.”

Leeroy laughs.
It’s a broken sound.

“No.”

The vision accelerates.
He is back in space, but now he is inside his own command shuttle, racing toward a star.

Not just any star.

Sol.

Earth hangs below—blue, fragile, full of voices, laughter, history, mistakes.

Starfleet fleets swarm it like carrion birds.
His hands are steady on the controls.
Tears stream down his face.

“I’m sorry,” he whispers—to his mother, to his pack, to everyone.

He arms the device.

A weapon no one should ever build.
A sun-killer.

The star begins to destabilize, light warping, screaming in physics-defying agony.

Starfleet realizes too late.

The admiral’s face flashes across a screen—horror replacing certainty.

“Leeroy—don’t—”
The star goes nova.

White.
Absolute.

The solar system unravels in a cascade of annihilation. Planets vaporize. Fleets are erased. Earth is gone in a single, merciless flash.

And at the center of it all—
Leeroy floats, alone.

No pack.
No station.
No council.
Just silence.

A voice—not loud, not cruel—echoes through the void.

This is the cost of being strong enough to win.
This is the price of protecting everyone.

Are you willing to pay it?
The vision snaps.

Leeroy gasps, slamming back into his chair in the café, knocking it over as the cup shatters on the floor.

The lights flicker violently.
The hourglass on the counter explodes into dust.

He’s breathing hard—ragged, animal—hands clenched into fists, eyes wide, pupils blown.
For a long moment, he can’t speak.

When he finally does, his voice is quiet.
Hoarse.

“…That’s what they’re afraid of,” he murmurs.
Not Starfleet.
Not the Void.

1q273qs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q273qs,Percy's aquarium: The Seahorse (Part 1),"(A/N: Hey, just a head's up! I know that with this part, the flair is a bit confusing but I promise with later parts, it'll make sense! With that, I hope you enjoy)



When I was a little girl, my mother always used to take me to this aquarium where I could go around each room and not bother her for a couple hours. But when I say aquarium, there wasn't actually any sea life, apart from a few small fishes that sat in tanks around the building. No, instead, the ""Sea life"" which made this aquarium came in the form of talking and singing animatronics and at the front of these mascots was the main attraction, the titled animatronic, Percy the Seahorse. 

Percy the Seahorse was a unbelievably large animatronic who sat in the front room of the aquarium and was there to greet you when you while the underpaid employees gave you your tickets. He was orange with yellow spots and although being a seahorse, his head took on the appearance of an actual horse most of the time. He would move his head side to side, looking around before opening his mouth. I remember him smiling despite not having any teeth as he would welcome people into the aquarium.

""HOWDY Y'ALL! I'm Percy, are you ready for an adventure?"" 

After that, Percy's voice would ring out with facts for each sea life's room which you entered, sometimes he would even be plastered on the walls with a speech bubble of the most recent fact he had learnt. It was fun, at least when I was a kid.

Recently, I remembered this animatronic aquarium and the crew of mascots, including Percy, and decided that I must come back to my home town to find this place and to be sure it wasn't some wild dream I had as a child. So, packing up the very little things I had in my dorm, I made the trip back to my home town and to the small house I used to share with my mother. 

She still lived there, well not lived, not really. I wouldn't call what she has ""Living"".

No matter, I unpacked in my childhood bedroom and once I was done, I entered the main room where my mother sat, her blank eyes staring at the static of the television set. I stood behind her, staring down at her wisps of hair that were somehow still connected to her scalp. 

""Mama, are you there?"" I asked, although I knew what the answer would be. 

Silence. 

I moved until I was in front of her, blocking her view of the static as I moved to my knees, my hands moving to find hers and finally, for the first time since I was a teenager and left this house for what I thought was good, she met my gaze. 

""Andrea?"" Her voice was dry, her throat barely working to make the sounds to form my name. I nodded, offering my best smile despite how weak it was. 

""Yes, mama, it's me. It's Andi."" That brought a smile to my mother's face, her hands moving from mine to touch my face, her cold palms pressing themselves against my cheek. 

""Is it Christmas already?"" 

I let out a short breathy noise before shaking my head.

""No, mama, not yet. Actually, I'm here for something else, from when I was a kid."" I thought for a moment before I continued to speak. ""Do you remember an aquarium, but there was no actual animals in it?"" 

At my question, my mother appeared more lively than I had ever seen her, her eyes wild and her voice came out clear, nothing like the dry noises she had once made. 

""You can't go back there, Andrea, I can't let you, please Andrea!"" Her hands had moved to grab my wrists as I attempted to stand up, her aged nails digging into my skin as she continued to stare at me. ""You can't go there!""

""Go where?"" I asked which yes, I know was not a nice way to trick my mother, but I was desperate to find this place. 

""Percy's! It's not even open anymore, there's no point, Andrea. Why don't you stay here, we could watch a movie or the news or-"" I stopped my mother before she could continue to ramble, my mind finally being able to be pieced together. 

Percy's, of course.

I didn't know that Percy's aquarium had closed to be honest, but thinking back, it made sense that it didn't last long. I don't know why it actually shut down, I'll probably have to ask one of the older residents of the town, but it's probably something boring like bankruptcy. 

It may also have to do where it was located within the town. 

Once I had been able to calm my mother enough that she could go back to watching her static without worrying about me, I quickly made her a bowl of soup, placed it on the coffee table and then began to get what I would need before making my way to the aquarium. I grabbed my disposable camera, a flashlight and of course my phone, and then I left. 

The sun was setting by the time I got back into my car, but I didn't care, I just continued to drive further into town until finally, I reached the forest. Driving off the road and onto the dirt, I ignored the branches that dared to hit my windows and drove until finally, I saw a building that sat in the middle of the trees. I don't remember the forest being that big when I was a kid, almost like it had grown since then but I didn't question it, I just got out of my car and began to move towards the entrance. 

""Percy's aquarium: adventure for all ages!""

The sign was large, bigger than most and at the top, right where it said his name, there sat Percy the Seahorse, happily smiling down at me. While the sign which had once been covered in lights was now dull, unable to shine anymore, the Percy which sat on top seemed to still have most of its paint. For such an old place that was seemingly abandoned years, maybe even a decade ago, it was still in good shape.

I looked at the large doors painted like the ocean, moving to the handles as I grabbed a hold of the chains that laid across them. A padlock, of course. Lucky for me, whoever was given the job of putting these lock on the doors didn't do it tight enough to actually keep the doors closed. So, grabbing one of the handles and letting the chains rattle until the door was open as much as it could before the chains began to hold it back, I snuck my body between the gap and pushed until finally, I had entered the main room of Percy's aquarium. 

But I really wasn't ready for what I saw. 

The main room, also known as the ticket room, was pretty much the same from the last time I saw it. Painted blue walls with beautifully detail starfishes and jellyfishes littered around. The floor was cold, like stone, but it was a glittering blue, like someone had thrown their entire supply of glitter on the floor and no one had bothered to clean it up. The paint of the wall had begun to peel, and near the ceiling, there was definitely some kind of mold or rot that was attacking the building. There was also glitter in some areas on the ceiling but the rot had left the blue that was once like the sea becoming a swamp. 

And the smell, Christ the smell. I had to hold my nose and breath through my mouth as soon as I was able to enter the aquarium. Despite not having any actual sealife, the entire room smelt of dead fish or like the carcass of a bloated whale. It was so disgusting, somehow the smell of the forest was better than this. I looked around the room, my eyes watering as I moved towards the right wall, where there sat a few framed photographs. I looked at them all. 

The first image was that of a young girl and boy who were smiling at the camera, as behind them sat Percy, his dead eye stare laying in the middle of the photo. There was the hand of two different people, one on the side of the little girl's shoulder and the other on the shoulders of the boy but the rest of their appearance had been cut off. There was something familiar about the hands that laid on the little boy, as well as the look in the boy's eyes but I could not fully tell what it was. Fear? Excitement? It was too dark to fully tell and my flashlight didn't exactly help. 

The second image was just the photo of a woman, smiling at the camera. The image was in black and white so I couldn't tell what she exactly looked like, but her eyes were closed and her hair was tied neatly away. She was wearing a long dress which hem was not visible where the photo cut off. There was a small plaque of information under her photograph and I stared at each, slowly reading each word. 

""Miriam Hadley on opening day, 1989""

1989? This place opened in 1989? How strange, I always remembered it feeling so brand new when I was a kid and that would have only been 2005 at the earliest. And this woman, Miriam, was she the owner? She seemed important enough to have her own photo for the opening day of the place. 

I shook off the confusion and let my eyes find the final photograph that sat on the wall, laying in the middle of both images and the largest image of them all, it was an image of Miriam again, but this time, she was next to a man whose face I had not seen before, but whose hands I recognised as those belonging to the photo of the two children. 

The man had a clean shaven face and his hair was dark and short. He had lines on his face but no actual wrinkles, dimples where his smile was wide upon his lips and his eyes were barely open. He was staring at Miriam who was shaking his hand, looking straight at the camera and not even staring back at him. She looked older than the last image but not by much. It was an odd image so I let my eyes wander until I found the plaque of information. 

""Percy and Miriam Hadley, Co-owners, 1995"" 

Six years after the first image of her, that made sense. So she was the owner, or at least one of them. And Percy. 

I stared at the image of Percy Hadley and while I did not know who he really was, he much have been important to have the entire aquarium and even the main mascot named after him. I wonder if they were married, or siblings. They didn't look related but you never know, although they look like they are the same age. Twins? No, that's not right, they must be a couple, that's-

""HOWDY Y'ALL!"" I jumped out of my skin, turning around with my flashlight in front of me and turning until I saw what I should have seen as soon as I entered this room. 

Percy, not the person, but the Seahorse. 

I kept my flashlight on the animatronic, holding it there as the voice of the Seahorse filled the room once more. 

""I'm P-P-Percy, are you you ready for an adventureeeeee?"" It trailed off after that, a slow droning sound filling the room as I sighed, rolling my eyes at the animatronic. The one yellow spots on the orange paint of Percy had rubbed off completely, parts of the orange of his skin near the spots also gone and revealing a rusting metal underneath. The movement of his mouth was clunky, no longer following each word and just moving up and down like it was moving in the wind. The eyelids that normally helped him to blink were stuck halfway on his blue eyes, unmoving and leaving his eyes not closed but also not open. The part of his body that was segmented to help him moved from side to side was now cracking, the sound of creaks echoing against the constant drone of his voice. 

I let out a sigh.

""What the fuck?"" I mumbled, looking around the room and moving back to the middle as I moved towards the ticket booth. Obviously, no one was still working there so I just helped myself, jumping over the locked area and exploring the different shelves that sat under the register. 

It was a mess of papers and tickets that laid randomly throughout the shelves and also on the ground. Some of the tickets which had landed on the floor were stuck, as if they were once wet and had dried against the glitter. I pressed my sneakers against the floor as I pressed my flashlight into my mouth and against my teeth, letting my now free hands explore each shelf. I pushed most of the paper to the side and let some of them come tumbling down next to my feet as my fingers continued to roam until I felt something metallic touch my fingertips. 

I pulled it out, removing the flashlight from my mouth and using it to shine a light at what laid in my palm. I found a collection of keys. Well, at least I won't get trapped if a door decides to suddenly close on me. 

I stood up, looking up at the animatronic seahorse again as I let out a short snorting laugh.

""Well, I'll see you later, buddy.""

I looked around the room one final time, staring at all the little details before I sighed, moving to stare at the two different doorways. 

""Entrance"" and ""Exit"", I guess I know which way I'm going. 

So, without actually putting any thought into what I was doing, I moved towards the doorway marked ""Entrance"", pushing the white and blue streamers that acted as a door out of my way and taking the steps to make it inside.

So you feel like a misfit puzzle piece. You're scrolling through your feed watching everyone else seem so effortlessly at home in their groups, relationships, jobs, while you're sitting there wondering what cosmic joke made you this way. Trust me, I get it. I've spent way too much time analyzing this exact feeling after noticing it everywhere among my peers and online communities.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: that feeling of not belonging isn't a personality flaw. It's actually a super common response to how modern society is structured. We're biologically wired for tight-knit communities of like 150 people max, but we're expected to navigate thousands of shallow connections instead. Our brains literally weren't designed for this shit.

I went deep into research from social psychologists, neuroscientists, and honestly some random YouTube rabbit holes to figure this out. What I found is that this ""outsider"" feeling often comes from a mismatch between who you actually are versus who you think you need to be. And the good news? You can rewire this.

**1. Stop performing and start filtering**

The biggest mindfuck is thinking you need to FIT IN everywhere. You don't. Belonging isn't about molding yourself into whatever shape the room demands. It's about finding YOUR people and letting everyone else scroll past.

I started using this mental filter: ""Would I want to hang with these people if nobody else was watching?"" If the answer is no, why am I trying so hard? Research from Brené Brown (yeah, the vulnerability researcher everyone quotes) shows that true belonging requires authenticity first, acceptance second. Not the other way around.

**The Gifts of Imperfection** by Brown is genuinely life changing for this. She's a research professor who spent decades studying shame, worthiness, and belonging. The book basically explains why we self-sabotage our own sense of belonging by hiding parts of ourselves. This book will make you question everything you think you know about fitting in versus belonging. It's backed by actual data, not just feel-good platitudes, which is refreshing as hell.

**2. Your nervous system is probably stuck in threat mode**

When you've felt like an outsider for a while, your nervous system starts treating social situations like actual threats. Your body literally releases stress hormones when you walk into a room. No wonder you feel like you don't belong, your biology is screaming ""DANGER"" at totally normal interactions.

Dr. Stephen Porges talks about this in his Polyvagal Theory. Basically, your vagus nerve controls whether you feel safe enough to connect with others. If it's dysregulated from past experiences of rejection or isolation, you're physiologically blocked from feeling belonging even when you're technically accepted.

The fix? You need to retrain your nervous system to recognize safety. Sounds woo woo but it's legit neuroscience.

Try the **Finch** app for this. It's designed around habit building and self care but what makes it brilliant is the daily check-ins that help you track your emotional patterns. You start noticing ""oh, I actually felt okay at that coffee shop"" or ""this specific type of gathering always makes me spiral."" Pattern recognition is the first step to rewiring. Plus the little bird mascot is weirdly motivating.

**3. You're probably overgeneralizing from specific experiences**

Our brains are dramatic as fuck. You feel rejected by one friend group and suddenly your brain files that under ""I don't belong ANYWHERE."" Psychologists call this cognitive distortion, specifically overgeneralization.

**Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy** by Dr. David Burns breaks down these thought patterns in ways that actually make sense. Burns is a pioneer in cognitive behavioral therapy and this book has sold millions for a reason. It teaches you to catch these distorted thoughts in real time and challenge them with evidence. Like ""okay brain, I felt awkward at Sarah's party, but I had a great conversation with my coworker yesterday, so clearly I'm not completely broken."" The techniques are practical, not just theoretical psychology jargon. Insanely good read if you tend to catastrophize your social experiences.

**4. Shared activities beat forced conversations every time**

Trying to ""make friends"" by just talking is honestly exhausting when you already feel like an outsider. Your brain is too busy monitoring for signs of rejection to actually connect.

Instead, do shit alongside people. Join a climbing gym, a book club, volunteer somewhere, take a weird class. When you're focused on an activity, the pressure is off. You're not performing ""friend audition,"" you're just doing a thing. And humans bond way easier through shared experiences than forced small talk.

Dr. Marisa G Franco wrote **Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make and Keep Friends**. She's a psychologist who specializes in friendship, and this book is basically the manual nobody gave us. It covers why friendship feels so hard as adults and gives specific strategies backed by attachment theory. One insight that stuck with me: we overestimate how much people are judging us and underestimate how much they actually want connection too. Everyone is basically walking around feeling slightly awkward and hoping someone else makes the first move.

**BeFreed** is an AI learning app that I stumbled on recently, built by Columbia grads and AI experts from Google. You type in what you want to work on, like ""improve my social skills"" or ""become more confident,"" and it pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio episodes and an adaptive learning plan just for you.

What's useful is you can customize the depth. Start with a 10-minute overview, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with way more context and examples. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's this sarcastic tone that makes dense psychology concepts way easier to digest. It also has this virtual coach avatar you can chat with mid-episode to ask questions or get book recommendations based on your specific struggles. Makes it easier to actually absorb and apply this stuff instead of just passively listening.

**5. Your ""weirdness"" is actually your filter**

That thing you think makes you unlikeable? Your obsessive hobby, your dark humor, your introverted energy, your unconventional career path? That's not a bug, it's a feature. It filters out people who wouldn't vibe with you anyway and acts as a beacon for those who will.

I used to hide my nerdy interests thinking they made me less relatable. Turns out, the second I started being upfront about them, I found way better quality connections. The people who stuck around were actually compatible with the real me, not some watered down version.

**The Art of Gathering** by Priya Parker changed how I think about this. She's a conflict resolution facilitator who helps people create meaningful gatherings. The book argues that we've lost the skill of intentional gathering and most social events are boring as hell because they try to please everyone. When you create or seek out gatherings with specific purpose and energy, you naturally find your people. It'll make you rethink every social situation you attend.

**6. Belonging is a practice, not a destination**

You're not gonna wake up one day feeling like you finally ""made it"" and belong everywhere. It's more like building muscle, you have to consistently practice vulnerability, showing up, initiating plans, having awkward conversations.

Some will land, some won't. That's literally how it works for everyone, even the people who seem effortlessly social. They've just normalized the trial and error part instead of seeing every failed connection as proof they're broken.

Start small. Text one person. Show up to one thing. Share one real thought instead of a polished take. Notice when you feel even 10% more connected than usual. Build from there.

The weird paradox is that the moment you stop desperately seeking belonging and start living as your actual self, belonging tends to find you. Not everywhere, not with everyone, but in the places and with the people who actually matter.

Your brain isn't broken. The system is just set up in a way that makes genuine belonging harder to find. But it absolutely exists, and you absolutely deserve it. You just gotta stop trying to fit in and start filtering for where you actually belong.",1,1767379886.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

We talked for a bit and conversation was genuinely fun and engaging. 

Later in the evening (at which point I was quite drunk so my recollection is vague) we again started talking one on one for quite some time. The conversation shifted to matcha for some reason and I mentioned not having tasted it yet. Half as a joke I put ""Matcha"" on a random date in my calendar saying I was going to try it then and she said ""you should invite me too!"". I changed the title to ""Matcha with [her name]"" so it was clear that it'd just be us, and she didn't seem to mind. She was also receptive to me putting my hand on her shoulder/arm a couple of times after, nothing crazy but worth mentioning.

The evening after I texted her that I had a good time and if she still wanted to grab matcha soon, but she hasn't responded for a full day🤔. Like girl, you asked me to invite you lol. 

Maybe it's too soon to make conclusions, but was it unreasonable to assume that grabbing coffee one on one with basically a stranger was supposed to be (something like) a date?

1. **Watch a contemporary weekend drama** – I love weekend dramas’ depth of storytelling, but I got into a self-fulfilling prophecy situation where I expected them to give me insomnia, so then they *were* and have not watched one in over a year. I believe the curse is broken (fingers crossed), and I’m really looking forward to immersing myself in this kind of drama again! 
2. **Catch up on a couple of classics (Coffee Prince & Reply 1988)** – These two have been sitting on my list. I have a feeling I’ll enjoy them or at least find them interesting, and I’ve decided 2026 is the year I finally catch up. 
3. **Trust my instincts** **more** – I have this spidey sense that sometimes tells me within the first half hour or less that a drama is not for me. Since I can never pinpoint where it’s coming from, I tend to ignore it. However, experience has taught me it’s pretty much always right. I’m already ahead on this one since just yesterday it went off within the first 10 minutes of a VERY beloved drama on this sub, and I almost immediately switched it off and started something else. It’s still sitting on my list, but it’ll now probably be a couple of years before I circle back since I was already on the fence about it. 
4. **Drop more dramas in the middle** – I find it harder and harder to drop the more episodes I’ve watched. Last year, I was proud that I dropped a total of 7 dramas after watching more than 1 full episode. (For reference, in the previous 3+ years of drama watching, I had a total of 10 in this category.) In 2026 I’m going for double digits with a soft goal of dropping 10 dramas in this category.

We were together for 3 years, shared a home, raised kids (hers), and built a real life together. It's been 3 months since the breakup and 2 months since she moved out.

She said she felt neglected for approx a year due to the chaos and routines of our lives and she felt so closed off. was more about emotional patterns, and her feeling like she needed to ""grow into womanhood alone”. She just turned 30. 

After she moved out, we had limited contact. The longest no contact I managed was about 10 days. She broke it by texting ""Merry Christmas."" A few days later, I reached out again, and she came over.
We talked for hours, cried, made love, said ""I love you,"" and she stayed the night. The next day we met for coffee, held hands, kissed, and talked like nothing had changed.

She told me her love for me never disappeared and that our connection feels ""timeless."" She says it's a ""hard pill to swallow that no one will ever love her or see her like I do."" I am the first woman she has been with. There were never any signs during the relationship she was questioning her sexuality. She often expressed how things made sense now. She didn’t hesitate to come out to her very catholic mother who told her she was just confused. She ended up accepting us anyhow. 

But she shut down. She says she doesn't want to go backward and believes God is telling her to move forward - even though she admits she isn't afraid to try again. She just doesn't want to. Since the breakup, she's leaned much more heavily into religion and now believes God is giving her signs to explore a connection with a male friend she had previously friend-zoned - despite what she feels for me.

She still has things at the house, says she'll come get them and doesn't, wants to stay ""best friends.” Because we truly are best friends. I have made it clear I cannot do this. We are still so intertwined. Still on the same car insurance. She still has things at the house. She’s saying things like she has to obey God and deny her flesh. But then in the same breath says no, she’s not denying her sexuality. Just obeying God. It makes no sense. I understand the importance of no contact. 

But has anyone gone through this? I didn’t see this coming. I’ve been Agnostic most of my life and began exploring God when we separated, but I’m having a hard time understanding this. I expressed this to her and tell her I have so many questions.. all she says is she does too. But it doesn’t have to make sense.. not even to her. 😩",8,1767379763.0,actuallesbians,3,0.9,False

Those are my current focus areas, but if you have other ideas I welcome them. My full list is below:
- fill wall space with art / photos
- new lamps/placement (some rechargeable bc socket placement)
- replace coffee table with something less farmhousey
- unused fireplace - tile surround and fill with something more permanent than cards
- shelves - cover geometric wallpaper
- window seat - replace cover
- curtains? But getting big enough for the bedroom was hellish

I’ve narrowed it down to these 3 apartments:

* **Lockefields** – Haven’t toured yet. Way cheaper, which is tempting, but not sure about safety / noise / general vibe.
* **Canal Overlook** – Toured and liked it, but it feels expensive for what it is, especially with no in-unit washer/dryer. But love that Kroger is near.
* **Axis** – Loved the apartment itself and the location, but the online reviews are pretty rough, so I’m conflicted.

If anyone has lived in or around these places, I’d really appreciate honest opinions.

Also how realistic is Indy without a car? I’ll be remote most days but still want to be able to walk to coffee, groceries, etc.

1q26v25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q26v25,How would you arrange this living room?,"I've currently lived in my small home for the past 5 years and have thought about switching things up. The living room is pretty small and can basically only fit a couch and 2 chairs comfortably with a small coffee table. But I feel like maybe someone more creative than me could come up with a better layout.

The first picture is the layout of the house. Note that the landing of the stairs has a skinny coat closet and there are two bookshelves on either side of the large window on the left that face inwards (denoted by the arrows).

The seconds picture is how the living room is currently arranged, more or less properly to scale. We have 2 armchairs and a small side table towards the front window, a large couch with a skinny, long side table behind it near the windows on the left, and then a small shelving unit in the corner of the room (which is the weirdest space that I have never know what to do with it). There's a rug that is slight askew and is out of the main traffic area from the front door to the stairs with a small coffee table on it. One thing missing is that the television is mounted above the non-functional fireplace and the bookshelves are built-ins that can't be removed easily. Also the opening on the right leads into the dining room.

What do y'all think? Is this probably the best arrangement for this room?",1,1767379472.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

Main things that need to be changed are the mantle and TV are too high, but in bringing them down I may as well redo that entire wall while I’m at it because I don’t love the vinyl white wood. It needs more layered lighting, more curtains so they aren’t stretched so far, the round mirror needs to be a large painting, and I hate the coffee table. Problem is, what color curtains, what style coffee table, and what the hell do I do with that wall.

Our typical style pulls inspo from Japandi, industrial, and French styles.

Notes: dark blanket is for the pup.. it’s our compromise so she can be on the couch with us, not a design choice. Also the gap between the couch and that wall is necessary for the room to feel balanced and to leave a walkway between the couch and the kitchen bar that you can’t see in the photos.

I was diagnosed late-in-life, so I've developed really good organizational and project management skills to scaffold around my ADHD.

99% of what I need to remember lives in my calendar. Any actions and follow-ups are immediately scheduled. For example, I submit X paperwork to a city agency and I'll schedule a cal invite in 7 days called: ""Follow up: did city agency confirm receipt of X paperwork?""

One thing I can never seem to find a good place for is ""FYI"" type of notes that do not require a follow-up task. Here are some examples of thoughts/notes I have trouble finding a home for:

* I repaint my home. The wall paint is ""Swiss Coffee"" by Benjamin Moore in an eggshell finish. The baseboards are the same color but in a semi-glosss finish. I don't plan to repaint every year (only need touch-ups as needed), so this isn't really an ""action"", it's a ""FYI"".
   * **My current approach:** I email myself these notes and literally title it: ""FYI: Home Paint Colors"" because Gmail has a great search function.
* I spent time researching which ski rental chain store carries a very specific type of ski I like. I want to remember this store allows multi-day rentals of up to 7 days and they feature X version and Y version of the specific type of skis I like. I don't have any ski trips planned, but I expect to go *sometime* this season.
   * **My current approach:** Maybe this should live in Google Maps, but I also have 500+ pins in Google Maps, so.... maybe not?
* I bought a pair of black sunglasses I really like but lost them. I'm not too worried about it, I'm sure it's somewhere in the garage and I have lots of other sunglasses that I can wear.
   * **My current approach:** Writing this down on my ""Someday To Do"" list.

What's worked best for me thus far is writing all my ""Someday To Do"" and ""FYIs"" in a bulleted list on my bathroom mirror because I see it every day when I brush my teeth. My therapist told me this is probably anxiety-inducing (I don't feel anxious when I see the list, I feel relieved that my thoughts have a safe home) and challenged me to erase my bathroom mirror list.

Now, my thoughts are just hanging around in my brain or scattered across multiple mediums and platforms and I'm irritated I can't find the piece of ""FYI"" information that I know I have... SOMEWHERE!!!",4,1767379120.0,adhdwomen,24,1.0,False
1q26o96,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q26o96/aita_for_refusing_to_host_another_night_after_my/,AITA for refusing to host another night after my friend treated my place like an open bar?,"Me (29F) and a couple of friends decided about a month ago that we wanted to have a board game night. One friend (let’s call her Kelly) was visiting from Norway, and the other one (let’s call him James) lives with housemates he has ongoing issues with. So naturally, I suggested hosting at my place. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, and he happened to be out of town that week. I also genuinely enjoy having friends over.  
  
In the group chat I said I would take care( and paid) of the snacks and that we could order some takeout. All I asked was that everyone bring their own drinks. We picked a date and that was that.  
On the day of the game night, James suddenly called me to ask if I had a raclette machine. I was confused, because we had already agreed on takeout and snacks. I told him I didn’t have one and reminded him that all they needed to bring were their own drinks. I had already spent around €60 on snacks. At that point, James said that he and Kelly were “in the mood for tea.”  
  
I’m not really a tea drinker myself, so I went back to the grocery store to buy Sprite so I could make vodka Sprite for myself (I already had vodka and some other alcohol at home).  
  
An hour later, James and Kelly arrived. James brought a full Tupperware container with leftover soup. They immediately started eating the snacks I had prepared, and almost everything was gone within half an hour. I politely asked them to use the napkins I had put out and to please not make a mess on the floor. James responded that I had become “a bit too tidy” since living with my boyfriend. He then proceeded to drop crumbs on the floor anyway.  
  
After about an hour of Monopoly, James asked if he could heat up his soup. I said sure, assuming he would use the microwave. Instead, he started rummaging through my kitchen looking for pots. This was his first time ever in my new apartment. While eating his soup, he was also bragging about how cheap it was.  
A bit later, Kelly asked if she could also have a vodka Sprite. I thought it was odd, since neither of them had touched the tea they brought and they were both drinking my sparkling water, but I said yes and grabbed another can of Sprite for her. While I was in the pantry, James looked over my shoulder, saw all the other drinks I had, and excitedly said he wanted wine. I’m a people pleaser, so I opened a bottle of rosé. I had a glass myself, but James basically drank the entire bottle.  
  
Later on, James asked for Baileys or a passion fruit martini, and Kelly said she wanted a Bellini. I said I was only willing to open one more bottle, and they chose the Bellini.  
While this was happening, I started thinking about past experiences. I’ve only been to James’s place twice since he moved out of his parents’ house. Both times, he made sure to spend no more than €10 on food and drinks. Both times, I brought some kind of bottle with me. When we go out together, he regularly sneaks in alcohol so he doesn’t have to pay anything. He once attended a three-day festival without spending a single euro.  
Normally, I don’t care what people do with their own money. But I’ve known James for about 20 years. He comes from a wealthy family and earns over €3,000 a month. I earn significantly less. Despite me asking everyone to bring their own drinks well in advance, he didn’t bring anything and drank at my place as if it were an open bar.  
Kelly, on the other hand, volunteers in Norway and doesn’t earn much, so her drinking my drinks bothered me less.  
At the end of the night, James asked if he could have coffee. At that point, I was honestly done, so I (childishly) lied and said we didn’t have any and that he could have his tea instead....He didnt even drank his own tea after that  
  
A few days later, James asked if I could host a movie night at my place, since his housemates don’t want him to host. That’s where I finally drew the line and said I wasn’t willing to host another night for a while, at least not for him. I also told him that I thought it was rude that he didn’t bring his own drinks after I explicitly asked, yet treated my home like an open bar.  
So now I’m wondering: **AITA?**

1q26hl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/umanitoba/comments/1q26hl5/officebisons_2025_buildings_ranking/,OfficeBison's 2025 Buildings Ranking,"Okay, so I've ranked the buildings that I've visited at the university. I used [this ranking engine thing](https://www.pubmeeple.com/ranking-engine) for the most part. I had to add in a few more buildings to my list manually because some buildings were missing on the list on the Intranet! I'm probably missing some buildings.

This is my subjective ranking. I'd love to hear what y'alls think as well!

1. **Tier Building** \- Tier is truly an iconic building for me. My favourite room in it is 302 Tier. Not only is it versatile in that it works well for small lectures and for seminars, but there used to be some coffee stain on the floor. That and I've taken some wonderful courses in the room. As for Tier itself, I've taken a lot of courses there. It's also right by the bus stops, so it's really the main building if you think about it.
2. **Elizabeth Dafoe Library** \- Yeah, I guess it's ranked high here. Not a surprise given that I've spent lots of time in this building, whether it's been getting books, writing papers, researching/reading, etc. Some people don't know how to shut up though sadly. Oh well!
3. **Fletcher Argue Building** \- Yeah, I had office space here as a graduate student for a bit. I've also worked in this building! What truly makes this building stand out is the confusing way to get to the second part of the third floor (the side that hosts the Department of Religion and the Department of German and Slavic Studies), which confused me as a student and has confused countless other students. Oh, and did you know that the namesake of the building, Fletcher Argue himself, was actually fired from the University of Winnipeg for arguing? I love that so much!
4. **Basic Medical Sciences Building** \- I've never taken any classes here, but I do spend lots of break time at work here. I like the vibes overall, namely that it has graduation photos from the 1800s! Oh, and it has [this ash tray](https://www.reddit.com/r/umanitoba/comments/1pl39vb/what_is_this_thing_on_the_second_floor_of_the/) inside as well.
5. **St. Andrew's College** \- If you had asked me in August 2025 what I thought about St. Andrew's College, I would have given you nothing. I recently spent some time doing additional work in this building and I've grown to enjoy it more and more. Not only does it have a wonky status as to whether or not it's a part of the University of Manitoba (e.g., it has a separate AESES agreement for support staff, it has its owns degrees, and its keys are not tracked by Physical Plant, but it's on the campus maps, UManitoba courses are sometimes held there, etc.), but it's a really nice space overall, both inside and outside. I've seen deer nearby on more than one occasion. What a treat!
6. **Isbister Building** \- I've also taken some great courses in this building, including some courses that I took in my very first year as an undergrad student. My understanding of this building has changed over the years, namely that I've recentlyish learned that it has some security concerns. Items have been stolen and two department offices (the Department of Indigenous Studies and the Department of Women's and Gender Studies) have doorbells and locks to enter them because of incidents in the past. I actually know the staff member who successfully advocated for those. I'm glad that those security measures are in place for the staff members working there, sometimes alone, because being near the final stop of the busses puts them as risk.
7. **Wallace Building** \- It's giving McDonald's play place to be quite honest. I love the aesthetics, and the fact that it's kind of a museum with geodes and dinosaur bones (!) is super swanky. I'm also biased because some of my early courses were in this building. Nevertheless, if you haven't visited Wallace before, do it!
8. **Human Ecology Building** \- Again, some early courses bias. However, did you know that this used to be the Home Economics Building? Yeah, it used to be a thing at the university, but they removed the programming for some reason. Maybe enrolment dropped? I know a staff member who actually has such a degree. But anyway, I like this building also because it feels historical. I love the older graduation photos as they remind us of our history.
9. **Taché Arts Complex** \- It's always nice to hear people playing music in this building, and it's also the host of various dramatic productions. For that reason, it's ranked high for its entertainment value. That and the architecture itself is unique as well.
10. **Physical Plant** \- I've visited Physical Plant (the building) just once, and it was to get my staff ID card encoded for card swipe access. To be honest, I like it because of the people there. I've interacted with people from Physical Plant (the unit) on many occasions and I've had lots of position experiences. This includes work order requests, receiving mail, and occasionally bumping into the people there from to time. I also heard that they have a ""Bird's Nest"" part of the building. How cool is that!?
11. **Armes Building** \- Okay, so some of the lecture theaters here are not super bougie. However, Armes really is the link between buildings and facilitates the tunnels such that I cannot help but rank it favourably. There's spooky music and cool visual arts in the dumpiest part of the building (the Armes Link) as well.
12. **University College** \- There are some good lecture theatres here and, believe it or not, I actually did a lecture once! It was in University College, hence me mentioning it here. I also recall that people LOVE to smoke right outside the door here. Once I return to Fort Garry Campus, I intend to become bold enough to call them out. In between jobs, a colleague also spilled massive tea to me in this building, so that bumps it up. I also spent a small bit of time in the staff lounge in this building.
13. **Dentistry Building** \- While some of the floors here are kind of... traditional, I rank this building higher because it does a lot of great work for the community. People who otherwise cannot afford dental care receive it here for a much lower cost. Recently, many patients, including those who are in the direst of financial situations, have been provided dental care for free. I'm also of the understanding that, like the old Immunology Building and the old Basic Science Building, this building too will be destroyed and eventually replaced with something else.
14. **Helen Glass Centre for Nursing** \- Helen Glass is an interesting building because it's a medical building that's on the Fort Garry Campus while the other Rady Faculty of Health Sciences programs are on Bannatyne Campus (although technically Human Ecology is in Rady as well). I like it in part because I attended jazz camp partially in this building. It also hosts the Re-Shop, which is a great way for units to get rid of used furniture and for others to pick it up for free!
15. **Engineering and Information Technology Complex** \- Technically three buildings, but I'm including them all together for convenience. Yeah, I've taken only a couple of courses in these buildings, but I like the architecture and it's kind of cool to see what stuff goes on in here. It's populated well and feels very alive. I also know a decent amount of people who have taken programs in Engineering, so there's that too.
16. **St. John's College** \- St. John's and St. Paul's Colleges are interesting in that there are people from a variety of faculties who have offices here. It's like a mosaic in that sense. Anyway, I actually did some math camp in this building, which biases me towards it. I also like the vibes overall. It has a cute little library as well, which is where I popped off in my final term of undergrad and really ""locked in"" to finish my final papers early. I got an A+ in all of my courses that term! I also fondly recall a staff holiday party and another important academic event in this building. 
17. **Duff Roblin Building** \- So my home department was previously located here, but it has since moved. Additionally, this building has both Arts people and Animal Science people (?). I've done some staff work in this building and I really learned about the relationship between walls being town down, security, and recordkeeping. In case anyone's curious and wacky room numbering, it's because walls are torn down and rooms are combined from time to time.
18. **Mary Speechly Hall Residence** \- We actually boarded in this building for math camp! The main lecturer for the camp was none other than the iconic [Donald W. Trim.](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~dtrim/) Just like people LOVE smoking outside of University College, so too does Donald Trim LOVE math, and it rubs off on his students. My dad took courses with him, so it was actually cool to take math camp with him. We also played Mafia (the party game) in the residence, so that was awesome.
19. **Education Building** \- Yeah, I've taken some courses here. The building itself is kinda homely and I also like how there are lots of graduation photos as well. I also remember that I was heading there once and these Mormon missionaries stopped to talk to me. I eventually had to let them go, but Brother Simpson said that he would add me on Facebook. It's been several years now and I haven't received the friend request, so I feel like I've been burned...
20. **St. Paul's College** \- What a warm space! And it also hosts a really beautiful library, where I've spent time writing, etc. and I've even taken out a few books there too. I recall the ceilings being very low in one spot and there being some posters about archaeology and its relationship to Judaism there.
21. **Robson Hall** \- It's a very professional building, and I've been in there only a couple of times. Namely, I had to get some posters stamped for something. It was also where lawyer and breakout star of Survivor US 47 Genevieve Mushaluk got her Juris Doctor. Make sure to stan her on Survivor US 50 and she makes her return.
22. **Parker Chemistry Building** \- So, I've spent very little time actually in this building. It's been a transitory space for me. However, I enjoy those posters about graduate school there and it's got some nice study booths there that are relatively new.
23. **Drake Centre** \- It's a gorgeous space, but it feels kind of exclu. While other spaces are welcoming to students for studying, the spaces in Drake are advertised as for Asper students only... That kind of sours me to it. However, I have taken three courses in this building, all of which have been great! Actually, two and a half... Now we were taking a French class on literature and we had to buy five novels for it. We only ended up reading four, and the instructor taught us three works for *hooker* in a separate class, but that's besides the point. Anyway, so we were in this really nice room for out MWF class. Recall that these classes are 50 minutes each, so there's 10 minutes between classes. Now while you're probably heard of ""island time"" (which has some social issues attached to it, but whatever), but have you heard of ""Asper time""? Asper time is real! They don't have MWF and TR classes. No, they have MW (!) and TR classes, each being 75 minutes long normally. This means that an uninformed instructor in Asper would falsely accuse your French instructor of holding us back 5 minutes later than he should. Yeah, an Asper instructor kept getting into arguments with our instructor over this. Unfortunately, just like in *Le Loup et l'Agneau*, which our instructor taught us earlier, ""might equals right"" and we were kicked out into less luxurious room in University College instead.
24. **ARTlab** \- Kind of a confusing space, but if you're bored, it can be a fun idea to look at some of the work done by students in the area. I'd be scared if someone threw me off an upper floor and down into the middle area though...
25. **Brodie Centre** \- It's the University Centre but on Bannatyne Campus. It's kind of a cute space, but it's really open concept, which isn't ideal for the events being hosted there. I also don't buy food on campus. Oh, and the book store is still closed for some reason. Not a bad building at all, but it's not special.
26. **Max Bell Centre** \- I walked across the stage here, so I can't rank it too low. That's it.
27. **Allen Physics Building** \- Another transitory building for me, but it has fewer things that interest me compared to Parker, hence its ranking here.
28. **UMSU University Centre** \- Overrated! Yeah, it's got some good units like the Registrar's Office, but the overpriced businesses by a ""union"" whose executives are infamous for embezzling money... Yikes. Also, screw everyone who says *UMSU* instead of *University Centre* for a shorthand. *UMSU* also refers to the union and, by metonymy, also to the executives of said union. Conversely, *University Centre* only refers to the building itself, so it's less confusing. That and I believe that distinguishing these terms makes it easier for students to better understand how the ""union"" works and all of the benefits that come from that knowledge.
29. **Medical Rehabilitation Building** \- I often go to the bathroom in this building. It's nothing particularly special though.
30. **Extended Education Building** \- A transitory space, but I do nothing in this building.
31. **Centre for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning** \- The building itself seems kind of bland even though I like the work that this unit does.
32. **Buller Building** \- I've only ever been here for exploration purposes. It's kind of interesting, but it feels kind of messy physically in the halls and therefore hazardous. It's been a while though.
33. **Pathology Building** \- Another transitory space.
34. **Architecture 2 Building** \- A cool space if I recall correctly, but again, the study area there feels very exclu. I also recall the poster approval process being contradictory with what they had at the old Answers Desk...
35. **Chown Building** \- It's got some nice spaces in it, but it's otherwise very boring to walk around in it. It does have some older artistic works portraying medicine from different time periods, but the writing about it is kind of annoying. It criticizes the pieces for being limited in what ethnic groups it covers. Okay, but then why not add works from different artists around the building then? It seems like it's complaining but doing absolutely nothing to solve the issue at hand. It kind of rubs me the wrong way.
36. **John Buhler Research Centre** \- It's a part of Brodie Centre... kind of. Most of the spaces are kind of blocked off, so I have little experience with it.
37. **Machray Hall** \- I've been in the upper floors once. Now, it's just a little entrance in Armes until the construction is done. I'm looking forward to it though!
38. **Administration Building** \- An iconic building, and I LOVE that it still has *Agriculture* written on it. However, would I feel comfortable exploring the building without getting interrogated? No way! Therefore, it's down here.
39. **Biological Sciences Building** \- I've been in here once and it was kind of uninspiring from what I saw.
40. **Apotex Centre** \- An interesting building in that it has lots of study spaces and even some games for students. It's set apart from the rest of the Bannatyne Campus and it feels kind of secluded.
41. **Medical Services Building** \- Another transitory space.
42. **Welcome Centre** \- Welcoming for who? I've been here before to return lost items and had good experiences, but the building itself seems kind of boring.
43. **Sinnott Building** \- Where this building begins and ends, I don't know. It's attached to St. Paul's College. When I finally found this building, it felt kind of dingy and scary. I would not go there alone during the evening.
44. **55 Chancellors Circle** \- Yeah, this building got renamed. I went to this building from the tunnels and there was some random couch in a super dingy area. Like, what the heck? LOL It felt like some students just found a room, stole a couch from somewhere, and called it a lounge.",11,1767378660.0,umanitoba,2,0.74,False

In June 1994 I quit my $700 a week construction job with a pregnant wife, one kid, and $3,200 to my name. Bought a used window van for $2,000. Had basic tools. Zero customers.

First day out I knocked on doors in Ridgewood NJ. Handed out business cards at coffee shops. Offered free system evaluations.

Got a call. Ladys compressor was dead. Hot summer day. I quoted $1,875. She said yes. I installed it that afternoon. That was almost 3 weeks pay from my old job. In one day. She stayed a customer for 18 years until she passed away in 2012.

Fast forward 24 years. Grew from solo operation to 5 employees. Built a 10 year guarantee system that locked in recurring revenue. 80% of business came from referrals by year 10. Sold in 2018 and retired with multiple properties paid off and zero debt.

I worked my ass off. 6am to 9pm 7 days a week in year 1. Almost quit in month 3 when money was tight and my wife was giving me the look. But I figured out a few things that changed everything.

How to close deals without being a pushy salesman. How to handle ""youre $2,000 higher than the other guy"". How to use a 10 year guarantee as a competitive moat. How to get building departments to quietly refer customers to you. Which customers to walk away from.

1q26gl1,https://i.redd.it/uxtx9nmoazag1.jpeg,New Year Ramble by the Fire with Rebecca West,"After building a decent following around social-political commentary during uni, I deleted myself from the internet, switched to a flip phone, and returned to the material world several months ago. 10 min a day on this sub with this burner account, a few Substack subs, and occasionally reading a print newspaper/listening to the radio is my only contact with the outside world.

I simply couldn’t do it anymore. If belonging to a greater “culture” in the modern world means perpetually LARPing and being concerned with online image, I want nothing to do with it. Even Substack is just a bunch of LARPers now. I don’t want to talk about AI, optimization, the culture wars, listen to cynical podcasts trying to make a buck off the world falling apart, or have my likeness put into weird online boxes of any sort. I don’t want to spend my evenings watching pseudo-intellectual videoessays on YouTube. I don’t want to swipe through dating apps. I simply don’t want to partake in this dystopia. I just want to be a human building real-world shit with other real-world humans. I want real meaning with real people.

Doing this has been incredibly difficult but, by all means, the best thing I've done since I quit drinking and drugging four years ago. The issue is, of course, I’ve found very few walking the same path as I am. If being truly autonomous and embodied means being disconnected from the outside world, so be it.

I’m 25. I moved home with Mum and Dad in July. I grinded my ass off for the LSAT for three months, got a 170, and applied to a dozen law schools before falling apart and deciding I want nothing to do with the modern world.

My highly credentialed boomer parents simply don’t understand why I don’t want to slave away for three years only to work sixty-plus hours a week alongside psychopaths in some soulless office afterwards. They simply don’t understand the omnipresent despair that defines most young people's existence these days and how inhuman we have become on account of tech — how so many of us have simply given up, and with good reason.

After taking the LSAT, I was a server barely scraping by on Medicaid just to come home after a ten-hour shift and be hounded by my parents about why I’m not something special yet. They laid everyone off and closed the restaurant with zero notice three days before Christmas. The other servers were all I had for real-world connection.

I’m sitting by the fire reading this beautiful mammoth of a book. This and the friends from uni who still call me on my flip phone are all I have now. If I had the financial means to go and be a modern-day Thoreau, I would.

But the truth is, I don’t want to be alone. *I want to belong to something*. But it’s damn near impossible to belong to a real-world community if you’re under a certain age these days. No one goes out. All my buddies from high school just get high, watch reels, and sports gamble all day. Everyone is at home just rotting on their devices. When people do go out, everything is done just to be posted. 

I go to the gym and everyone is wearing the same shit because some jacked guy or hot girl plugged it online. Even in crowded coffee shops, every conversation is about whatever inhuman shit is going on online and how the individual sees himself/herself in relation to whatever online vibeosphere has influenced them; people talking about managing their ADHD, OCD, body dysmorphia, ""setting boundaries,"" etc., or whatever pathology they put themselves into because the mental health influencers told them about it.

1q26fmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q26fmf/desperate_for_relief_chronic_sinusitis_for_almost/,"Desperate for Relief: Chronic Sinusitis for almost 2 years, can doctors/ENTs of Reddit help? CT scan included","**CT Scan image:** [**https://i.imgur.com/cl9btsW.gif**](https://i.imgur.com/cl9btsW.gif)

I've been dealing with debilitating Chronic Sinusitis for almost 2 years now and despite doing seemingly everything and anything, nothing seems to help. It has been making my life a living hell and I'm at wit's end trying to find relief. This endless cycle of infection, sinus pressure, loss of smell and taste that never ends is driving me crazy.

# Overview:

Despite never having had a sinus infection ever, I had my first one in May 2024. Since then, my life has been non-stop dealing with recurrent infections.

These infections tend to stick around and have almost always taken multiple courses of antibiotics to help but they always seem to come back. Have been put on basically all types of antibiotics to help and only my most recent ENT has been doing cultures but even knowing what antibiotic the bacteria is sensitive to doesn't seem to help.

My latest one started in September and since then I have been put on 3 courses of Augmentin. The bacteria was cultured before each round and each time, the bacteria that grew from mucus was Klebsiella oxytoca. It was tested to be sensitive to Augmentin. Every time I took the Augmentin, symptoms seemed to get better but once the courses completed (two 14 day courses and one that was 21 days) it all just kept coming back in full force.

In December my mucus finally started to turn clear after being switched from oral antibiotics to a tobramycin rinse (my mucus is now mostly the clear/cloudy jelly type instead of the super sticky yellowish mucus that used to get so bad that it would block my nasal passages - rinsing could never get it out and I'd have to see my ENT to suction it out). From what I've read here and from what my latest ENT has said this gelatinous type of mucus may be indication of lingering or increasing inflammation.

My sinus pressure has been increasing for the past couple weeks and I have now have lost my sense of smell and taste almost completely (I'd say about 1-5% of normal). Strangely I can slightly smell fruity scents and slightly taste miso but everything else is completely bland. I still taste sweet, salty, bitter - but all other tastes are gone. Apart from strong fruity smells, all other scents are gone - I can't even smell freshly ground coffee anymore.

**I've been religiously following this regimen:** Daily sinus rinses 3-4 times a day, sometimes more, with Saline and Xylitol. I end the night with a soak in the Mygind position with Budesonide and Tobramycin added to the saline and xylitol. I let the tobramycin and budesonide rinse soak for about 10 minutes with my head hanging off the bed in hopes gravity will deliver it to my ethmoid/sphenoid/frontal sinuses - apparently it's not working. My new ENT in Chicago is switching me from budesonide rinses to ,ometasone but the compounding pharmacy is still working on it so I haven't started that yet. He says the mometasone is stronger and less systematically absorbed than budesonide.

**Medication:** I take these daily: Sudafed, Mucinex, Xyzal or Zyrtec, Xhance morning and night 10-20 minutes after rinsing. Azestaline spray once a day. Sometimes I add in Nasonex but that doesn't seem to help.

I managed to get a prescription for Dupixent approved by insurance but that's the nuclear option and I am deathly afraid of biologics so would prefer to avoid this if at all possible.

Over the past 2 years I've had 4 courses of steroids which seem to help a lot, with the last one in June 2025 right before my balloon sinuplasty.

**Supplements:** NAC, Quercetin + Bromelain, Nattokinase + Serrapeptase, Multivitamins, Fish Oil, CoQ10, Turmeric. I even tried L. sakei (Lanto Sinus) for a bit but that seemed to only make things worse so I stopped.

**Allergies/Immunology:** I see/saw an Allergist/Immunologist in addition to having seen 3 different ENTs: I apparently have severe allergies to Austin allergens (mostly trees), no immune issues - all blood panels came back normal. This is strange because I lived in Austin for 4 years without any allergic reactions (no runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes). I was put on allergy drops for over a year to no avail. As a result, I moved to Chicago 3 weeks ago to see if moving to a place with no allergens in the winter would help. It seems to have decreased the amount of mucus I'm producing drastically but the mucus I do clear out is still the clear/cloudy gelatinous type and my sinus pressure and loss of smell seems to have just gotten worse.

**Procedures:** I had a balloon sinuplasty performed in June and during the procedure, multiple tiny polyps were removed from my left side nasal passage despite not being detected during any prior endoscopies. I lost my sense of smell/taste following the procedure for 3 months and it finally came back in September. I thought everything was going well, then a nasty sinus infection hit me that has been haunting me since.

# Here's the report from the radiologist accompanying the CT scan:

This is from before I moved from Austin to Chicago.

36F, 170cm, 53kg

**PARANASAL SINUSES:**

Maxillary: Small fluid levels with superimposed frothy material in the left. Patent ostium, infundibulum and middle meatus bilaterally

Ethmoid: Scattered moderate to severe mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.

Frontal: Hypoplastic right frontal sinus. The bilateral frontal sinuses are opacified. The bilateral frontoethmoidal recesses are opacified.

Sphenoid: Mild mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus which is filled with frothy material

throughout. No mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid sinus. The right sphenoethmoidal recess is narrowed secondary to mucosal thickening. Otherwise, the bilateral sphenoethmoidal recesses are patent

Mastoid and middle ear cavities: Well pneumatized bilaterally.

Nasal Septum: The nasal septum is not significantly deviated.

Turbinates: At the time of the examination, the nasal turbinates are symmetric without gross enlargement.

Cribriform Plate: Olfactory fossae are symmetric, Keros classification, borderline type I/II bilaterally. No dehiscence.

Lamina Papyracea: Unremarkable.

Onodi Cells: Not present.

Sphenoid Pneumatization: Sellar.

Anterior Clinoid Pneumatization: None.

Anterior Ethmoidal Artery: Not exposed.

Other Variant Anatomy: There is no enlarged ethmoid bulla or concha bullosa. Bilateral Haller air cells are present. Intersphenoid septa attach to the anterior wall of the bilateral cavernous ICAs.

Soft Tissues: The visualized contents of the orbits, intracranial space and cervical soft tissues are within normal limits.

**IMPRESSION:**

1. Scattered paranasal sinus disease most severe in the frontal sinuses and ethmoid air cells. Small fluid

levels are seen in the bilateral maxillary sinuses. Frothy material fills the right sphenoid sinus. Overall, findings are improved when compared to prior exam on 10/07/2024.

2. The bilateral frontoethmoidal recesses are opacified. The remaining major paranasal drainage pathways are patent.

3. No significant nasal septal deviation.

Not sure if any ENTs/doctors might be able to help figure out why I can't seem to kick this sinusitis and why my smell/taste keeps going away? Is there anything that I can suggest to my ENT during my next visit?",1,1767378546.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False
1q26fd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1q26fd0/screen_cuts_to_blackresizes_randomly_but_terminal/,"Screen cuts to black/resizes randomly, but terminal is fine.","I accidentally cut the power to my PC when playing a game, and (I don't know if it's related but) since then, whenever I'm past the login screen or the terminal, my screen will cut to black for a few seconds when I click, move my mouse, try to interact with the panel, etc.. I believe the entire screen is shifting/resizing for a frame whenever this happens as well. **It seems that my monitor is acting like it's changing the resolution constantly.** The terminal and login page work just fine, so this isn't an HDMI connectivity issue or anything -- Seems like a display error.  
  
I tried updating my GPU driver and rebooting with no success. I also tried shutting it off, disconnecting power, waiting, and then rebooting.  
  
**Wayland fixes this issue until I try to change my display settings** for some reason, *but* that introduces its own set of other problems for me, so I'd rather find a solution that works with the standard display server. I'm quite new to Linux and I haven't been able to find any other thread with this issue.

I might have been more sympathetic when I was younger, but now that I’m older I just see everything through a different lens.

Some examples (usually randomly inserted into our conversations):

-He expressed annoyance that his wife doesn’t make an effort to dress nicely anymore and just wears tie dye shirts (after I complimented his tie dye coffee mug). 

-Him openly sharing that his wife was depressed last year.

-He talks about how his wife gets on his case to fix things or repair things around the house.

-When I tried to be nice and make conversation by asking how he met his wife, he said they met in high school and that he used to stick wads of paper in her hair.

-He complains that his wife never apologizes.

-He says that his wife is a smart ass and that I should be prepared for that if I ever meet her.

-He has brought up multiple times that his wife does the cooking and likes to cook, almost like a bragging point. He often brings lunches that his wife has made. He even asks the other men at the office if their wives also cook for them and made saucy comments when one said no.

-When he started dating his wife officially in college, what drew him to her was that she always had warm food on the stove for him.

I understand that none of this is egregious, but it somehow just saddens my heart for this woman. I can’t recall him ever really saying anything positive about her (except that she cooks). I would be devastated if that is how my husband talked about me or what he thought of me. I feel this is just so revealing of how many men actually regard women and subtly resent their wives. I am also starting to resent that he feels he can so freely share this information with me as if I’m supposed to be sympathetic.

Robert with Rice Shower, Rice, fuck the haters. Don't beat yourself up for doing your job. You're a great race horse and no one has the right to take that away from you.

1q268oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/1q268oh/desperate_for_relief_chronic_sinusitis_for_almost/,"Desperate for Relief: Chronic Sinusitis for almost 2 years, can doctors/ENTs of Reddit help? CT scan included","**CT Scan image:** [**https://i.imgur.com/cl9btsW.gif**](https://i.imgur.com/cl9btsW.gif)

I've been dealing with debilitating Chronic Sinusitis for almost 2 years now and despite doing seemingly everything and anything, nothing seems to help. It has been making my life a living hell and I'm at wit's end trying to find relief. This endless cycle of infection, sinus pressure, loss of smell and taste that never ends is driving me crazy.

# Overview:

Despite never having had a sinus infection ever, I had my first one in May 2024. Since then, my life has been non-stop dealing with recurrent infections.

These infections tend to stick around and have almost always taken multiple courses of antibiotics to help but they always seem to come back. Have been put on basically all types of antibiotics to help and only my most recent ENT has been doing cultures but even knowing what antibiotic the bacteria is sensitive to doesn't seem to help.

My latest one started in September and since then I have been put on 3 courses of Augmentin. The bacteria was cultured before each round and each time, the bacteria that grew from mucus was Klebsiella oxytoca. It was tested to be sensitive to Augmentin. Every time I took the Augmentin, symptoms seemed to get better but once the courses completed (two 14 day courses and one that was 21 days) it all just kept coming back in full force.

In December my mucus finally started to turn clear after being switched from oral antibiotics to a tobramycin rinse (my mucus is now mostly the clear/cloudy jelly type instead of the super sticky yellowish mucus that used to get so bad that it would block my nasal passages - rinsing could never get it out and I'd have to see my ENT to suction it out). From what I've read here and from what my latest ENT has said this gelatinous type of mucus may be indication of lingering or increasing inflammation.

My sinus pressure has been increasing for the past couple weeks and I have now have lost my sense of smell and taste almost completely (I'd say about 1-5% of normal). I had full smell and taste before these past couple of weeks. Strangely I can slightly smell fruity scents and slightly taste miso but everything else is completely bland. I still taste sweet, salty, bitter - but all other tastes are gone. Apart from strong fruity smells, all other scents are gone - I can't even smell freshly ground coffee anymore.

**I've been religiously following this regimen:** Daily sinus rinses 3-4 times a day, sometimes more, with Saline and Xylitol. I end the night with a soak in the Mygind position with Budesonide and Tobramycin added to the saline and xylitol. I let the tobramycin and budesonide rinse soak for about 10 minutes with my head hanging off the bed in hopes gravity will deliver it to my ethmoid/sphenoid/frontal sinuses - apparently it's not working. My new ENT in Chicago is switching me from budesonide rinses to ,ometasone but the compounding pharmacy is still working on it so I haven't started that yet. He says the mometasone is stronger and less systematically absorbed than budesonide.

**Medication:** I take these daily: Sudafed, Mucinex, Xyzal or Zyrtec, Xhance morning and night 10-20 minutes after rinsing. Azestaline spray once a day. Sometimes I add in Nasonex but that doesn't seem to help.

I managed to get a prescription for Dupixent approved by insurance but that's the nuclear option and I am deathly afraid of biologics so would prefer to avoid this if at all possible.

Over the past 2 years I've had 4 courses of steroids which seem to help a lot, with the last one in June 2025 right before my balloon sinuplasty.

**Supplements:** NAC, Quercetin + Bromelain, Nattokinase + Serrapeptase, Multivitamins, Fish Oil, CoQ10, Turmeric. I even tried L. sakei (Lanto Sinus) for a bit but that seemed to only make things worse so I stopped.

**Allergies/Immunology:** I see/saw an Allergist/Immunologist in addition to having seen 3 different ENTs: I apparently have severe allergies to Austin allergens (mostly trees), no immune issues - all blood panels came back normal. This is strange because I lived in Austin for 4 years without any allergic reactions (no runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes). I was put on allergy drops for over a year to no avail. As a result, I moved to Chicago 3 weeks ago to see if moving to a place with no allergens in the winter would help. It seems to have decreased the amount of mucus I'm producing drastically but the mucus I do clear out is still the clear/cloudy gelatinous type and my sinus pressure and loss of smell seems to have just gotten worse.

**Procedures:** I had a balloon sinuplasty performed in June and during the procedure, multiple tiny polyps were removed from my left side nasal passage despite not being detected during any prior endoscopies. I lost my sense of smell/taste following the procedure for 3 months and it finally came back in September. I thought everything was going well, then a nasty sinus infection hit me that has been haunting me since.

# Here's the report from the radiologist accompanying the CT scan:

This is from before I moved from Austin to Chicago.

**PARANASAL SINUSES:**

Maxillary: Small fluid levels with superimposed frothy material in the left. Patent ostium, infundibulum and middle meatus bilaterally

Ethmoid: Scattered moderate to severe mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.

Frontal: Hypoplastic right frontal sinus. The bilateral frontal sinuses are opacified. The bilateral frontoethmoidal recesses are opacified.

Sphenoid: Mild mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus which is filled with frothy material

throughout. No mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid sinus. The right sphenoethmoidal recess is narrowed secondary to mucosal thickening. Otherwise, the bilateral sphenoethmoidal recesses are patent

Mastoid and middle ear cavities: Well pneumatized bilaterally.

Nasal Septum: The nasal septum is not significantly deviated.

Turbinates: At the time of the examination, the nasal turbinates are symmetric without gross enlargement.

Cribriform Plate: Olfactory fossae are symmetric, Keros classification, borderline type I/II bilaterally. No dehiscence.

Lamina Papyracea: Unremarkable.

Onodi Cells: Not present.

Sphenoid Pneumatization: Sellar.

Anterior Clinoid Pneumatization: None.

Anterior Ethmoidal Artery: Not exposed.

Other Variant Anatomy: There is no enlarged ethmoid bulla or concha bullosa. Bilateral Haller air cells are present. Intersphenoid septa attach to the anterior wall of the bilateral cavernous ICAs.

Soft Tissues: The visualized contents of the orbits, intracranial space and cervical soft tissues are within normal limits.

**IMPRESSION:**

1. Scattered paranasal sinus disease most severe in the frontal sinuses and ethmoid air cells. Small fluid

levels are seen in the bilateral maxillary sinuses. Frothy material fills the right sphenoid sinus. Overall, findings are improved when compared to prior exam on 10/07/2024.

2. The bilateral frontoethmoidal recesses are opacified. The remaining major paranasal drainage pathways are patent.

3. No significant nasal septal deviation.

4. Anatomic variants as described above.
