[\[Part Two\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1i9fg/the_perfect_day_to_wake_up_part_two/)

I didn’t sleep much that night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the words: *We see you.* Not just as text, as if someone had carved them behind my eyelids. I tried telling myself it was just stress. Work, routine, caffeine. But every thought looped back to the same whisper I’d heard in the bathroom: *Wake up.*

By morning, I felt hollow. I didn’t shower. Didn’t make toast. Just sat there, watching my watch tick. I thought if I stared long enough, maybe I’d catch it twitch again.

It didn’t. It was perfect. Too perfect.

At 6:17 a.m., my alarm still went off.

I hadn’t even set it.

The sound made me jump. My heart felt like it was trying to punch through my chest.

I turned it off, grabbed my keys, and decided not to go to work today. Not the café, not the office. I’d drive somewhere else. Anywhere else.

When I stepped outside, the air felt heavier. Thicker. Like breathing through fabric. The neighborhood was exactly the same, same lawns, same houses, same cars parked in the same places. Not one curtain moved.

As I pulled out of the driveway, I glanced at the car’s clock.  
6:43 a.m.

When I reached the main road, it was still 6:43 a.m.

The numbers didn’t move.

The highway was empty, the horizon a washed-out blur. I drove faster. A long stretch of road wound through fields, but after a few miles, the scenery repeated. The same cracked billboard, the same bent road sign, the same dead crow on the shoulder.

At first, I thought it was déjà vu. Then I realized, it wasn’t *similar.*  
It was identical.

I passed the same scene five times before slamming the brakes.

The engine idled, low and uneven. I sat there gripping the steering wheel, watching heat shimmer on the asphalt.

I turned on the radio.

Static.

Then, faintly, a voice came through, calm, polite, rehearsed.

*“Everything’s okay, Daniel. Go home.”*

My stomach dropped.

It was *my name.*

*“You’re having a bad day, Daniel. That’s all.”*

I switched the radio off. My hands were shaking.

When I turned the car around, the clock jumped to 7:02 a.m.

The sun brightened suddenly, too bright, like someone had turned up a dimmer switch. The light hit everything evenly, no shadows, no depth.

By the time I pulled back into my street, people were outside.

Joggers. Dog walkers. Neighbors. All of them smiling too wide. All of them turning their heads in perfect unison when my car rolled past.

One of them waved.

Her lips didn’t move, but I heard her voice inside my head, as clear as if she were sitting next to me:

*“Welcome back.”*

I nearly crashed into my mailbox.

I ran inside, locked the door, and sat against it. My breathing came out ragged, hands shaking.

I tried calling my sister. She lived two states away. She’d know how to calm me down, tell me it was all in my head.

The call rang once.

Then a click.

And her voice: *“Hey, Danny.”*

*“Hey,”* I said, forcing a laugh. *“I just-uh, weird question. Can you tell me what day it is?”*

A pause.

Then she laughed, soft and mechanical.

*“It’s the perfect day.”*

My blood ran cold.

*“What?”*

*“It’s the perfect day, Danny. It’s always been the perfect day.”*

I hung up. The phone buzzed in my hand, same number calling back. I threw it onto the couch.

I sat there for what felt like hours, trying to steady my breathing. My reflection in the TV screen looked pale, distant. Then the TV turned on by itself.

No static this time. Just my house. Live feed.

The camera angle was impossible, from the ceiling, looking down at *me.*

I stared at myself staring back.

Then a voice, male this time, calm, reassuring, spoke from the television:

*“Don’t panic, Daniel. You’re doing great.”*

I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the coffee table.

*“You’ve been adjusting well. Small inconsistencies are normal during observation.”*

*“Who are you?”* I shouted.

No response.

*“You’re safe here.”*

I hurled the remote at the screen. It cracked, flickered, and went black. My heart was hammering so hard I thought I might pass out.

Then I heard it, a faint knock at the door.

Three slow knocks.

I froze.

The peephole was dark, like someone had covered it with their hand.

*“Who is it?”* I called out, voice shaking.

A pause. Then:

*“Your coffee.”*

The barista’s voice. The one from the café.

I stepped back, the floor creaking beneath me.

*“You forgot your coffee, Daniel.”*

Another knock. Louder.

*“You have to stay on schedule.”*

I backed away until my legs hit the couch.

Then my phone buzzed on the cushion. One new text. No number.

**DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR**

I stared at the message, then at the door.

The knocking stopped.

Silence.

After a long moment, I crept forward and peered through the peephole.

No one there.

Just the street, still, empty, washed in white light.

Then, faintly, from somewhere far beyond the walls of my house, I heard the applause.

A crowd. Cheering.

And above it all, a voice echoing through unseen speakers:

***“Cut to commercial.""***

1o3bk0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1o3bk0q/looking_for_feedback_on_short_story/,Looking for feedback on short story.,"The caretaker heard the knock between wind gusts. Three, even. Not pleading. Measured.

He unlatched the door. A man stood there, frost woven into his beard, coat stiff with rime. The stranger said, “I made it back.”

The caretaker blinked at that. “Back from where?”

“From the storm,” the stranger said, and stepped inside before the cold could make up its mind.

They moved by habit: kettle, fire, bench. Steam lifted from the stranger’s gloves in small ghosts. The caretaker poured coffee into two chipped mugs, the same green enamel every hand before him had used.

The stranger took his with both hands, like someone remembering warmth. “You keep this place alone?”

“Off-season.”

The stranger nodded. “I know.”

“You’ve been here?”

“Once,” he said. “A long time ago. Or maybe it’s now. Hard to keep the count straight once the wind starts telling it.”

The caretaker smiled thinly. “You talk like a preacher.”

“Not a preacher. Just someone who remembers things.”

They drank. The lodge settled on its haunches. Somewhere in the rafters, a rope tapped rhythm against wood.

The stranger stared into his mug. “I should tell you how it happened,” he said. “How I ended up out there.”

“You said your truck stalled?”

The stranger shook his head. “Not this time. I was checking the traps, couldn’t see the road but I knew where it should be. I guess I got turned around and couldn’t find the lodge.”

The caretaker frowned. “You mean this lodge?”

The stranger looked around the room, as if testing it. “Yes. This one.”

“But I’ve been here alone all week.”

The stranger rubbed his thumb along his cup’s rim, as though smoothing time itself. “That’s what I thought too.”

He went on. “I tried to go back. I followed my own tracks, but the wind kept changing them. I saw lights ahead and thought I’d made it. When I opened the door—” He paused, smiled faintly. “When I opened the door, you let me in.”

The caretaker felt a pinch at the base of his skull, a pulse like memory misfiring. “You’re saying this already happened?”

“I’m saying it’s happening now.”

“You were the man at the door.”

The stranger nodded. “Someone had to be.”

The kettle began to hiss, slow and low, as if uncertain of its own song.

The caretaker reached for it, but the stranger was already pouring.

“When I came in that first time, the caretaker offered me coffee. Asked if I was alone. I said yes. He said, ‘Someone’s got to be.’ Funny thing about that, how it sounds different depending on who says it.”

The caretaker rubbed the scar on his thumb where a trap latch had broken years ago. The stranger mirrored the motion, same angle, same absent expression.

“Where’d you say you were from?” the caretaker asked.

“Before the storm,” the stranger said. “But that place doesn’t hold. You forget pieces of it. Names, roads, which door was yours.” He leaned forward. “You know the feeling.”

The caretaker opened his mouth to argue, but the words came slower than he expected. “Sometimes,” he admitted. “Long winters blur.”

“That’s how it starts. The blur. Then the remembering.”

“Remembering what?”

The stranger smiled. “The story. You start hearing it as if it’s yours.”

They sat in the hush between gusts. The fire clicked. The smell of snow found a way through the seams of the door.

The caretaker said, “Go on, then. Tell it.”

The stranger nodded. “I was out there. Checking the traps. A marmot had chewed the line. The gale blew and the white was disorienting.”

The caretaker’s hand twitched. He remembered. The ache in his back. The burn in his fingers. The sense of panic at being lost.

“You see?” the stranger said. “You were there.”

“I wasn’t,” the caretaker said, but his voice was uncertain now.

“Yes, you were. You said to yourself, ‘No one’s coming.’ You said, ‘If I keep moving I’ll find the lodge.’”

The caretaker stared at him. “I don’t remember saying that.”

“Then who does?” the stranger asked gently.

The fire dimmed. Only the blue of the coals breathed.

The caretaker said, “Maybe you dreamed it.”

“Dreams keep better than bodies,” the stranger said. “That’s why the storm tells them first.”

The caretaker gripped the table’s edge. He remembered last winter. The drifts up to the window. The quiet that ate the world. But now the memory was two-layered, one version in his mind, one in the stranger’s voice. They aligned like glass slides, indistinguishable.

“What happened to you?” the caretaker whispered.

“I walked into the white,” the stranger said. “Thought I’d meet the man who’d take my place. You looked like me, so it was easy. The storm loves a good likeness.”

“You’re saying I’m you.”

“I’m saying you were me.”

Outside, the storm shifted. The walls creaked as if something vast had rolled over in its sleep. The kettle gave a last sigh.

The caretaker stared into the fire. “Tell it again.”

The stranger began from the start. “A man lost in the storm, trying to get to shelter.”

The caretaker closed his eyes and saw it.

He whispered the next line before the stranger did. “I stumbled, too weak to get up.”

The stranger’s voice was quiet, kind. “The cold took over.”

The caretaker nodded, as though remembering the answer to an old question. “I succumbed to the storm.”

They spoke the last words together. “Someone had to.”

They found him by the stove, wearing the caretaker’s parka, frost clinging to his beard.

“You the one called it in?” a rescuer asked.

He smiled. “Storm’s done its work.”

“Anyone else here?”

He nodded toward the window. “He’s out front. Needed a bit of rest.”

They stepped outside. The snow had taken a body halfway, left the rest for witness. Ten yards from the porch he lay, head turned toward the door, as if still listening for the last line of a story he’d once told himself.

I’m an upper year medical student on clinical rotations right now and no one ever seems to eat. Everyone just chugs energy drinks or black coffee to power thru the day. Food is usually eaten quickly and without enjoyment in the work room. My senior resident (who is an amazing doc in all regards) told me the other day that she lost >!20 pounds!< in her intern year and to expect that I will probably have the same problem once I’m a resident. 

I’ve struggled with eating regular meals in the past, first as an undergrad and later as a grad student - I would be so hungry all the time but also feel that I had no time to eat (and maybe didn’t deserve to either) until my work was done. I got a bit better during med school in preclinical but this old mindset has pretty much come back since I started clerkships. 

We start pre rounding before dawn so everyone has coffee or a celsius for breakfast. The residents skip lunch all the time to catch up on backed up work (there is always more work) or see new patients (there are always new patients). They do encourage the medical students to go eat, but if you fall behind on your own tasks because you took a nice laidback lunch, then you have the pleasure of later telling everyone you’re the only one who hasn’t done your tasks yet when we next run the list. I’ve increasingly chosen to prioritize work over food, and my team has increasingly praised me for my efficiency and efforts.

I’ve taken to just cramming down protein bars and shakes, which sort of helps. Then I go home starving, smoke a joint, eat a bunch of junk food while I wait for my takeout to arrive, stuff myself, fall asleep extremely uncomfortable and bloated, and wake up the next morning to do it all over again.

I just hate this almost competitive feeling that the more you work, and the less you eat and sleep, the better a doctor you are. But I don’t want to let anyone down or get a bad eval, so I’m sort of stuck.",1,1760126835.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

I didn’t sleep last night. Or the night before. Or maybe I did, and just can’t tell anymore.

My phone buzzes again, lighting up my dark room in a soft blue glow. I sat on my couch, lights off, coffee cold, staring at the wall until I realized the clock wasn’t ticking again.

2:14 a.m.  
2:14 a.m.  
2:14 a.m.

It never changed.

And then the first notification came through.

**\[!@#??→sleep now\]**

And soon came even more. Spam after spam.

**\[!@#?:→sleep now\]**

**\[!@#?/→sleep now\]**

**\[!@#1!→sleep now\]**

**\[SLEEP. YOU HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING.\]**

I stared at my phone screen. It was shaking slightly in my hands.  
There wasn’t even a number attached, just symbols.  
Not even ones I could type. It wasn’t English, or any language I recognized. Just… shapes. Like alien runes.

I turned my phone off.

A second later, it buzzed again.

**\[§§001001\] → Sleep. You have work in the morning.**

My chest tightened.

*“What the fuck,”* I whispered.

I powered my phone off again, this time removing the battery just to be sure.  
But then my laptop pinged from across the room.  
Same sound. Same message, glowing on the screen.

**You have work in the morning. Sleep.**

I slammed it shut, but the words still burned in my mind, echoing in rhythm with the hum I could feel pressing against my temples.

**Sleep**  
**Sleep**  
**Sleep**

I clutched my head, muttering to myself. *“Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.”*

Because if I slept, I didn’t think I’d wake up again. Not here. Not anywhere.

By 3 a.m., I’d unplugged everything in my apartment, my router, my TV, my microwave, even my clock.  
Didn’t matter. The words kept coming. Every reflective surface, my phone, my window, the blank screen of my laptop, flickered faintly, showing the same phrase, sometimes scrambled, sometimes perfectly clear:

**WAKE UP**

**SLEEP**

**RESET**

The contradiction made my skin crawl. Which was it? Was I supposed to sleep, or wake up?

I tried to think rationally, but it was like my thoughts weren’t my own anymore. Like something was inside my head, tugging at the strings, trying to push me toward something I couldn’t see.

Then, a knock.

A single, gentle *tap-tap-tap*.

I froze.

The knocks came again, louder this time.

I swallow hard and whispered, *“Who’s there?”*

A pause. Then a voice I recognize.

*“Hey… it’s me.”*

My sister.

For a moment, relief washes through me, but something about the timing, about her being here, this late, claws at my nerves.

I pull open the door. She’s standing there, smiling, like she’s been waiting for me. Her eyes look brighter than usual. Too bright.

*“Hey, sleepyhead,”* she says lightly. *“You look awful.”*

I blink at her. “How, how did you know I wasn’t sleeping?”

""What're you doing he-""

She tilts her head. *“You texted me. Remember?”*

*“No, I didn’t.”*

She frowns. *“Yes, you did. You said you weren’t feeling well and you wanted me to come check on you.”*

My throat tightens. *“No, I didn’t send anything.”*

She just smiles again, like I’m being silly. *“You’re probably just exhausted.”*

I step back and let her in. She moves easily, like she’s been here a hundred times before, even though I haven’t seen her in weeks. She goes straight to the kitchen, fills the kettle, and sets it on the stove.

*“You still drink chamomile, right?”* she asks without looking at me.

I hesitate. *“How did you know I was out?”*

She laughs softly. *“You always run out. You never restock.”*

I sit down, trying to steady my breathing. The walls hum again, faintly, like the air vents are singing. My sister hums along to some tune I don’t recognize.

*“Something’s been happening,”* I finally say. *“I’ve been getting these messages. They tell me to sleep. They’re from these, these weird numbers that aren’t even numbers. And my days… I don’t know if they’re even real anymore.”*

She stirs the tea slowly, too slowly.

*“Maybe it’s just stress,”* she says, still smiling. *“You’ve been overworked.”*

*“No, it’s not stress,*” I snap. *“I’m serious. I think, I think something’s wrong. Everyone’s been acting strange. Even you. You’re acting strange right now*.”

She sets down the spoon and turns toward me. Her smile doesn’t fade. Her eyes don’t blink.

*“What do you mean, strange?”*

I lean forward, whispering. *“Like you’re reading from a script.”*

For the first time, she falters, just a flicker, before the smile returns. *“It’s all in your head,”* she says softly. *“You need to rest.”*

The words hit like a jolt.

I push back from the table. *“Who told you to say that?”*

She tilts her head, the same unnatural motion again. *“You should rest,”* she repeats.

I take a step toward her, my voice shaking. *“You’re not listening. You don’t even care what I’m saying.”*

Her eyes lock on mine, wide, glassy, almost lifeless.

*“I care,”* she says in a perfect, even tone. *“Because that’s what I’m supposed to do.”*

The kettle starts to whistle.

Neither of us move.

Something in my chest twists, tightens, and for the first time I notice it: the faint hum in the air syncing perfectly with the kettle’s scream. The pitch rises and rises until I can’t tell which is which.

Then..

*click.*

The sound stops.

My sister lifts the kettle calmly, pours the water into two cups, and hands one to me.

*“Drink this,”* she says. *“You’ll feel better in the morning.”*

I stare into the tea. The steam curls up in perfect, looping patterns, too perfect. Every swirl identical to the last.

I whisper, *“When was the last time it rained?”*

She doesn’t answer.

*“When did we last go to a concert?”*

Nothing. Just that smile.

*“When was the last time you slept?”*

Finally, her eyes twitch, a single, subtle glitch in her expression.

Then she says, softly: *“You’re tired, Daniel. You just need to close your eyes.”*

I set the empty cup down. The air feels colder now.

I cook most nights, read often, and share my space with two small terriers who think they’re running a boot camp.

1o3bdpm,https://i.redd.it/nbc9o7rybcuf1.jpeg,"""The Secret to Writing Articles People Actually Finish Reading ""","

Let’s be honest — we’ve all been there.

You start reading an article, the title hooks you, the first few lines sound promising… and then halfway through, you’re scrolling faster, your mind’s wandering, and before you know it — you’ve closed the tab.

No shame. We all do it.

Now, here’s the real question:
How do you write something that doesn’t make people click away?
How do you keep someone’s attention long enough for them to reach your final line — and maybe even think, “Wow, that was worth it”?

That’s what we’re diving into today — not tricks or clickbait, but the real secret behind writing articles people actually finish.




Write Like You’re Talking to a Friend

The biggest mistake writers make?
They write like they’re trying to sound smart.

But readers don’t want “smart.” They want connection.

So instead of sounding like a textbook, talk like a real person.

If you wouldn’t say it out loud, don’t write it down.

Instead of saying,

> “One must strive to maintain the reader’s engagement throughout the text,”
try,
“Let’s be honest, if your first few lines are boring, your readers are gone.”



See the difference? One sounds human. The other sounds like a robot in a suit.

Write like you’re having coffee with your reader — not lecturing them from a podium.




 Start with Emotion, Not Explanation

Readers don’t care who you are — at least not yet.
They care about whether what you’re saying feels real.

Start with something human — a thought, a confession, a mini-story.

Try this:

> “I used to spend hours writing what I thought were brilliant articles — and not even my friends finished them.”



That line makes people smile, nod, and keep reading.
It’s honest. It’s relatable. It feels like you’re them.

That’s how you build trust — not by shouting facts, but by showing you understand the feeling.




Keep It Simple, Keep It Short

Big blocks of text? Instant eye strain.

Medium readers skim — not because they’re rude, but because they’re human.
They’re reading between emails, during lunch, on the train, before bed.

So make your writing easy to breathe.

Break it into small paragraphs.
Use short sentences.
Let your words flow like conversation — pause, breathe, continue.

And please — don’t overcomplicate your language.
You’re not trying to impress; you’re trying to connect.



. Tell Mini-Stories

Facts tell. Stories sell.

You don’t need an epic tale — just small moments that make your message stick.

Example:

> “I once spent three hours rewriting one paragraph. Three. Hours.
When I finally published it, nobody cared. The lesson? Readers don’t want perfect — they want real.”



That’s what makes people nod and think, “Wow, I’ve done that too.”

And when people see themselves in your story, they stay till the end.



Give Value — But Make It Feel Light

Here’s the truth: people read for two reasons — to learn something or to feel something.

So yes, give value — but don’t lecture.

Teach gently. Explain simply.
Guide them like a friend showing you how to make a great cup of coffee.

The secret is balance: enough wisdom to be helpful, but light enough to enjoy.

You want your readers to walk away thinking,

> “I didn’t just learn something — I felt it.”




End with a Feeling, Not a Summary

Most people end with “In conclusion…”
Please don’t.

End with heart.

Say something that makes the reader pause — something that lingers.

Like this:

> “People won’t finish your article because it’s perfect. They’ll finish it because it feels like you wrote it for them.”



Your final line is your handshake — your thank you.
Make it warm. Make it human.



If you want people to finish your articles, stop trying to impress everyone.

Write for one person — that one reader who feels lost, inspired, curious, or tired, just like you.

Write like you care.
Write like it matters.
Write like your words could make someone feel a little less alone.

Because that’s what people really finish — not the most polished article, but the most human one.



✨ Try this:
Open your last article. Read it out loud.
Does it sound like a human talking — or a writer performing?

If it’s the second one, rewrite it like you’re texting a friend who really needs to hear it.

That’s when your readers stop scrolling — and start listening

I don't even know where to start. I guess with how it began. My husband and I have been together for eight years. Married for five. Things were fine. Not great, but fine. He worked long hours. I felt lonely. My best friend introduced me to her brother last year at a barbecue. He was funny. He listened. He asked about my day.

My husband never did that anymore.

It started as texting. Then coffee. Then one afternoon at his apartment. I told myself it was just physical. It didn't mean anything. My husband was so checked out anyway. He came home tired. We barely talked. I convinced myself he wouldn't even care.

I told my mom about my friend. Not the sex part. Just that I had someone who actually listened to me. She said I deserved to feel heard. My sister said the same thing. They both complained about my husband being too focused on work. When I hinted that this friend made me feel alive again, they didn't ask questions. They just nodded.

My husband found out three weeks ago. He came home early. I was on the phone with him. My lover. I didn't hear the door. My husband stood in the hallway and listened to me laugh. Tell this guy he was so much better in bed. Say things I never said to my husband.

He didn't yell. He just stood there. Then he said, ""Pack your things.""

I panicked. I called my mom. I told her my husband was being unreasonable. That he found out about my friend and was overreacting. She came over. My sister too. They cornered him in the kitchen.

""She's lonely,"" my mom said. ""You're never home.""

""Everyone needs support,"" my sister added. ""You can't expect her to just wait around.""

My husband looked at them. He looked at me. He said, ""You all knew?""

I didn't answer. My mom said, ""She needed someone.""

He left that night. Stayed with his brother. I thought maybe he'd cool off. My family kept calling him dramatic. My dad even texted him saying he needed to man up and forgive me. That marriages go through rough patches.

Then the group text came.

He sent everything. Screenshots of my messages. Me complaining about him. Me calling him boring. Me saying the sex with my lover was incredible. Me laughing about how my husband had no idea. Photos too. Not explicit ones, but enough. Me and this guy at his apartment. Timestamps showing I'd lied about where I was.

He sent it to everyone. My parents. My siblings. His parents. Our mutual friends. People from my work.

My mom called me immediately. ""What the hell is this?""

I tried to explain. She hung up. My sister blocked me. My dad sent one text that said, ""You're on your own.""

Work was worse. My boss is friends with my husband's cousin. She saw the messages. Called me into her office the next day. Said I'd created a hostile environment. That people were uncomfortable. I got fired.

My lover stopped answering my calls. His sister, my best friend, sent me a message saying I was disgusting for dragging her brother into my mess. She said he was just having fun and I was the married one. She blamed me.

I tried to apologize to my husband. He wouldn't respond. I went to his brother's place. He opened the door. Told me to leave. Said my husband was filing for divorce and I'd hear from his lawyer.

I begged. I said I made a mistake. He said, ""You made a choice. Multiple choices. Every single day.""

Then he closed the door.

I'm staying at a cheap motel now. Can't afford my apartment. Can't get my family to answer. Can't find a new job because everyone in my field has seen those messages somehow. My husband made sure of that.

I thought my family would stand by me. I thought he was the one being cold. I thought I deserved better.

Now I have nothing. No job. No family. No husband. The guy I threw everything away for won't even text me back.

My mom finally answered yesterday. She said I humiliated them. That she didn't raise me to be this person. That I lied to everyone and made them look like fools for defending me.

I asked if she'd forgive me. She said, ""Ask yourself if you'd forgive you.""

Was I really that wrong for wanting to feel wanted?

For context: I like my matcha creamy and a little sweet and I don’t mind a hint of grass — not syrupy, but I enjoy a smooth balance. If you're into very bitter, astringent,  or traditional usucha-style matcha, some of my lower ratings might be your 5/5. 

DISCLAIMER: THESE REVIEWS ARE FROM AN UNCULTURED TONGUE. I’ve rated mainly franchises so please do not consider these ratings up to par with high-quality usucha discerning standards.

🌟 Ride or Dies

I don’t have an Iced Matcha Latte that I crave regularly but I find myself getting the Copper Branch often because it’s by my workplace and Chachees because it’s close to home. Can’t wait to find an actual ride or die!

☑️ Would Order Again

🟢 Yogen Fruz (4/5)
* Order Iced Matcha latte w/ extra sugar
* Medium astringency, a little chalky (I don’t mind)
* Not syrupy despite added sugar — matcha flavour still there
* Wouldn’t go out of my way, but definitely solid if I’m nearby
* Waters down so drink within the hour if you can

🟢 Kung Fu Tea (4/5)
* Ordered Iced Matcha milk tea w/ foam
* Sweet, light matcha (50/50 matcha to milk flavour)
* Did not enjoy the salty foam — would skip that next time
* Solid franchise option otherwise

⚠️ Situational Faves

🟡 Copper Branch (3/5)
* Ordered Iced Matcha latte w/ oat milk + vanilla shot
* Creamy and sweet, but not overly so
* Matcha is light but present
* Waters down so drink within the hour
* Regular go-to since it’s close to work

🟡 Chachees Chai (3/5)
* Ordered Iced Banana Matcha Latte
* Matcha flavour is barely there unless you get a double shot
* Cold foam is good; banana-cinnamon combo works nicely
* Ridgeway location had much bolder flavours than Pickering
* Flavour doesn’t water down much if you consistently drink but don’t let all the ice melt before drinking

🟡 Daigyo (3/5)
* Ordered straight iced matcha latte
* Very astringent and almost fishy — super bold
* No sweetness; milk just makes it not-usucha
* Like a black coffee version of matcha — I had to drown it in vanilla syrup
* Hardcore matcha fans might actually love this

🟡 Jabal Coffee House (2.5/5)
* Ordered Iced Banana Matcha Latte
* Weak matcha flavour
* Not bad since I like a creamy matcha but I think people go more for the vibes than the flavours when it comes to the matcha (this is the matcha a teenager would drink—sweet and medium-light flavour)
* WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE

🟡 Eggstatic Ajax (2/5)
* Ordered a matcha latte and requested a vanilla shot
* Fun fact: I’m the first person ever to order matcha from them
* Tasted like matcha and water instead of matcha and milk
* Vanilla was weak and when I asked for more it became overpowering
* They admitted it was the staff’s first time making it and repeatedly requested feedback (politely) so I’m looking forward to returning to see if they’ve got it down now!

❌ Would Not Recommend

🔴 Chatime (1/5)
* Strawberry Matcha Milk Tea
* No no no no no no no no
* Just hot sweet milk + sickly strawberry jam
* No detectable matcha

🔴 Second Cup
* Iced Matcha Latte: Weak and sweet, but not offensive (2/5)
* Hot Matcha Latte: Tasted like warm leafy milk — even vanilla didn’t save it (1.5/5)
* Not for me

Always open to recs if you’ve found an iced matcha spot in the GTA that balances creaminess with a real matcha kick 👀",2,1760126363.0,FoodToronto,0,1.0,False
1o3ba1i,https://i.redd.it/nor3j3kabcuf1.png,pacamara dial-in help,"Hi everyone! We just started carrying this coffee at my workplace and I really enjoy it so I bought some. At the cafe we use a pour steady and the recipe is very different than how I like brewing manually. I'm having problems dialing this in at home and I don't want to waste a bag, so I'm wondering if I could get some advice.

At work, we use an EK43 and my recipe is as follows:
* I grind at 13 (decently coarse).
* Water @ 195°F.
* 12g coffee to 200g water (1:16.67).
* x3 bloom for 1:00, single slow pour to 2:00.
* Drawdown between 2:30-3:40. It tastes very sweet and and fruity, specifically blueberry notes.

At home I'm using an Ode gen 1 with gen 2 burrs. Same recipe as above but with 3 different grind sizes since I can't quite find the right size:
* First at 5.4 (idk how to read the Ode so it's the 2nd line), my usial Natural/Ethiopia setting.
* Next at 6.
*Last at 6.2 (first line after 6).

Each of the 3 cups at home has been progressively less astringent but at the same time lacking more and more body/intensity. Is it a grinder issue with fine? Should I adjust ratio? Am I missing something?",1,1760126343.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I was treated for it and tested negative after several months. Ever since I had C. Dif I have become intolerant to coffee and dark chocolate (the latter also contains small amounts of caffeine, and it takes longer to build up in my body). My blood pressure goes through the roof from just a little of these substances, and my GGT liver enzyme shoots up, too. It takes weeks to months for my blood pressure and GGT enzyme levels to return to normal.

1o3b6u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1o3b6u3/help_me_find_my_beautiful_little_town/,Help me find my beautiful little town,"What I'm looking for might not exist anymore. Maybe I'm just living in the past.

I grew up in Northeast PA and loved my childhood. I had access to the outdoors while being able to actually walk around neighborhoods. We went trick or treating, fished, played football in fields, and had access to at least moderately okay-ish schools.

Fast forward 20 years and I have a 2 year old with another on the way. In 2023, we bought a house in Warren County NJ - a very rural setting. We quickly learned this is not at all what we want - the schools aren't great, there are very few amenities that don't involve tractors, and most of all...you just plain can't walk anywhere. I'm dreading having my kid(s) live in a place where they need to be driven just to see a friend. There's very few third spaces (if at all).

Further, I'm currently working remotely but that likely will change. I'm in software and my wife is an NP. Her job market is pretty resilient but mine is not - hiring seems to have frozen solid, and I'm a strong believer that AI will disrupt the entire industry to the point that my career will not be viable. While I would like to (will need to) change careers, we need to consider the job market in either or both fields where ever we chose. She is currently a SAHM until they hit kindergarten, but each of us worked in Philadelphia before the move. Neither of us love it down there, but we'd bite the bullet if it meant the kids would be happy.

I'm going to throw out a completely disorganized list of bullet points that hopefully give a sense of what I'm looking for. I'm trying to be realistic and understand that not ALL of these are possible, but a man can dream.

* My family is in Northeast PA and my parents are pretty involved with my son's life. Think once a week visits. I'd like to encourage that. Right now it's about an hour and a half away.
* The dream town is walkable, like with actual sidewalks. It has a town center, a commons, or a village green with stores that aren't just vape shops. Growing up my brother and I walked 2 minutes down the road to a card shop and played Magic the Gathering most of our teen years, and it was the most important place on Earth.
* My wife and I loved school growing up and imagine them going through a similar structure, but I don't know if this is just nostalgia for a system that no longer exists. Covid seems to have done many school districts in (shown in truancy rates and test scores post-2019). Reading r/Teachers gives me minor panic attacks about the state of the public education system in the US, but we can't imagine anything other than sending them to public school. We'd either want the best possible district we can afford or some clever alternative that we haven't thought of (I don't even have a formed opinion on home schooling, for example).
* On an upper limit, we can a 4k/month mortgage, which includes property tax and home insurance.
* Obviously walkable neighborhoods and good schools confer safety, but I should be explicit and say I don't want to be worried anything other than petty crime. I've lived in Boston, Queens, and Philadelphia, and I have a low tolerance for some of the stuff I've seen in my younger years.
* We would move anywhere in the US if it meant the perfect environment, even at the expense of being further from family. They are all getting older, and it's not out of the question that one or more eventually have to sell their own house to live with us as they age. I don't want the distance to NEPA to be the sole factor, but it currently is just due to logistics of scouting new areas and general familiarity.
* An HOA or a vinyl-sided subdivision with sidewalks going nowhere is the total antithesis for what I'm looking for. Leihigh Valley is very guilty of looking good on paper, but actually looking like Edward Sissorhands in places.
* Car congestion, endless traffic, warehouse trucking routes, and commuter gridlock drive me nuts. I'd rather take a slower pace of life town with half my current salary if that makes sense.
* Other places I've visited or lived in that don't fit the mark:
   * Phoenixville, PA - great on paper, but coffee shops and breweries alone don't make a community. Couple this with outrageous prices and it's a miss.
   * Narberth, PA - nearly perfect minus the home prices and an air of Main Line haute make it challenging. We have considered just renting here instead of buying. It does borderline on Somerville/Morristown congestion though once you break outside of the town core.
   * Honesdale, PA - not nearly enough of a core to justify a move. An interesting weekend visit, but an obvious tourist culture and nothing except for the purely outdoorsy type (which we are somewhat, but definitely not exclusively).
   * Haddonfield, NJ - same issues as Narberth, with possibly higher prices
   * Doylestown, PA - really nice place, but really really really very highly priced. If I had a 50% coupon for a house here, this seems like a very nice fit. I also wish it had a quicker commute to Philadelphia, but at least there's a train line.
   * Somerville, NJ - I think of this more as a very congested commuter town with high prices. I don't think it would possible to avoid an NYC commute just to afford it here. The thought of living in another highly-populated, highly-trafficked, congested town makes my skin crawl. I'm probably being too harsh here, but it's why I mostly have avoided looking east of where I currently live. I'd like to be proven wrong on this point.
   * Morristown, NJ - see Somerville, NJ
   * Leighigh Valley, PA - see above. Hits some marks on school district and affordability, but Allentown is not really a bastion of a thriving white collar job market, along with it including some of the most depressing neighborhoods I've ever seen.
   * NEPA - sadly the school systems are almost entirely decimated, save for maybe Dallas / Back Mountain and Clarks Summit. If my mind hadn't been incepted from growing up there, it would make the Leighigh Valley look like Santa Barbara.
* Some places we're planning to visit / seem good on paper (these will all have school systems + distance first and foremost in mind):
   * Lewisburg, PA
   * State College, PA
   * Lititz, PA
   * Wyomissing, PA
   * Corning, NY - I've built this up like some paradise in my head so much that my wife is sick of hearing me talk about it. If anyone has any experience with Corning, extra points to you.
* And some longer-shots
   * Ithaca, NY - (though this is very pricey)
   * Albany NY suburbs
   * Longmeadow, MA
   * Northampton/Amherst, MA

Dental cleaning is more than a mere event; it is a very significant step on the road to optimum oral health. Although daily brushing and flossing are quite beneficial in avoiding dental problems, there isn’t any at-home procedure that can compare to the level of cleaning a professional provides during routine check-ups. Regular cleanings can have sweeping far-reaching effects in your teeth, gums, and general health. Dental cleaning near me

Let’s consider the reasons why having normal dental cleaning is essential, and why you should not miss a cleaning appointment. Dental cleaning near me

# 1. Prevention of Plaque and Tartar Buildup

On your teeth, there always is a sticky film of bacteria called plaque. If you fail to remove it, it hardens up into tartar, which cannot be removed just by brushing and flossing. The professional dental staff would remove this plaque or tartar during the course of cleaning to prevent cavities or gum disease. Dental cleaning near me  
This is why a person should undergo tooth cleaning: to avoid having tartar form inside the mouth, thereby exposing him to lots of dental-related problems that might be remedied by expensive treatment in the future. Dental cleaning near me

# 2. Early Detection of Oral Health Problems

During your clinical dental cleaning, the dentist or hygienist also checks your mouth for early indicators of tooth decay, gum disease, and oral cancer. These insidious diseases typically develop unnoticed and produce no symptoms until it is really proximate. For example, with more frequent check-ups, an intervention would be less likely to involve heavy treatment and would normally be much more successful and cost-efficient.  
An early detection of cavity could result in a vault filling, while a delayed identification could lead to a root canal treatment or even tooth extraction. Dental cleaning near me

# 3. Improved Gum Health

A periodontal disease is actually a general term for all probable avoidance from plaque or tartar build-up at the gum line. Early stages of this disease, which are referred to as gingivitis, can be reversed if proper maintenance has been performed. If untreated, it might progress toward periodontitis, which is a very serious kind since it can even lead to the loss of teeth. Dental cleanings play a major part in plaque and bacteria-removal activities that will help keep gums healthy. Your dentist can also give you tips on the proper maintenance of better oral hygiene practices designed especially for maintaining that further protection of your gums.

# 4. Fresher Breath and a Brighter Smile

No one wishes to deal with having bad breath or an uninspiring smile-another very important effect of dental cleanings. It involves removing some of the bacteria responsible for halitosis and polishing the teeth to remove surface stains. So aside from having a mouth that smells fresher and cleaner, it is an added plus to having a much brighter smile. Drinking coffee, tea, or smoking keeps one’s teeth slightly iridescent, so regular cleanings will help keep a brighter appearance for your teeth. Dental cleaning near me

# 5. Boosted Overall Health

It’s from oral health that up brings it to overall health. Studies have found associations between gum diseases and systemic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. This lessens the effects of inflammation in your body that may have been caused due to bacterial presence inside the mouth, harmful or otherwise, particularly to greater health implications such as heart disease, diabetes, or stroke. On a routine basis, it would further provide opportunities for a dentist to find what the mouth reveals about other hidden medical problems that could be happening, such as nutritional deficiencies or autoimmune disorders. Dental cleaning near me

# 6. Cost-Effective Dental Care

Preventative care by cleaning is much less than the cost of treating advanced dental problems. For a patient who maintains regular appointments, the costs of expensive and extensive procedures like crowns, bridges, or dental implants would eventually be avoided. Most likely, cleaning and examinations are fully covered under oral health benefits, making it really easy to keep an individual’s oral health free. Not making an appointment could mean paying a premium out of pocket later. Dental cleaning near me

# 7. Encouragement for Consistent Oral Hygiene

Visiting your dentist regularly helps you to remember the importance of good oral hygiene habits at home. Your provider will be able to give personalized advice, such as how to brush properly, proper flossing techniques, and the best products for you. Your visits also remind you to stay focused on your oral homecare routine, keeping your teeth and gums in good health until the next visit. Dental cleaning near me

# 8. Peace of Mind

Without the shadow of a doubt, there is certain enormous confidence if one really knows that the teeth and gums are in a very good state. Regular cleanings at the dentist get rid of all such doubt concerning oral health and provide some insurance against unforeseen happenings related to the dentition. Dental cleaning near me

# Tips to Maximize the Benefits of Dental Cleanings

* **Stick to a Schedule:** Strive to have your home professionally cleaned bi-annually or more often, as advised by your dentist. Dental cleaning near me
* **Maintain Daily Habits:** Brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste at least twice and flossing them at least once every day. Dental cleaning near me
* **Address Issues Promptly:** If your dentist finds a problem while you’re getting cleaned, don’t delay. Dental cleaning near me
* **Communicate Openly:** Discuss the concerns and symptoms with your dentist to make sure everything is done for comprehensive care. Dental cleaning near me

# Conclusion

Regular dental cleanings are a cornerstone of oral health. Beyond maintaining a sparkling smile, they help prevent serious issues, improve your overall health, and save you money in the long run. Skipping these appointments might seem harmless, but the risks far outweigh the convenience. Dental cleaning near me

Its merit isn’t guessing what society needs, but allowing each person to experiment, err, and correct with costs bounded by the discipline of competition. That process, as unromantic as it is indispensable, produces something rare in human history: enough abundance that most people no longer have to worry about immediate scarcity and can even focus on frivolities.

I call this comfort the “well-being paradox”: when the market order works, it makes the problems it solved invisible. A full shelf makes us forget the logistics; accessible medicine turns a hard-won conquest into an obvious given; food security pushes agricultural production to the background. Where there was once gratitude for provision, irritation over minutiae appears: the coffee isn’t “organic” by my standard, the app crashes for twenty seconds, the delivery takes one extra day. It’s the luxury of nitpicking.

  
This forgetfulness isn’t moral; it’s institutional. Prices, by condensing dispersed information, spare us from having to know everything; but that very efficiency raises generations with no memory of how wealth is created. Thus prosperity creates the conditions for a growing number of people to have the time and energy to worry “beyond their nonsense”: grandiose causes with no cost reckoning, administrative utopias that assume the relevant knowledge is “out there,” waiting for a benevolent planner.

  
From this comfort arise two anti-capitalist temptations:

**The illusion of conscious design.** If today things “show up” at the doorstep, we imagine a central brain could do it “better,” without waste or inequality. We forget that the knowledge needed to coordinate economic life isn’t theoretical or centralizable: it is tacit, local, changing. Prices communicate it; decrees crush it.

  
**The morality of the static outcome.**  
  
Once basic needs are met, we judge the order by distributive snapshots rather than by learning trajectories. We want instant justice, when the only justice compatible with human ignorance is that of general rules that enable correction, not the pursuit of specific ends dictated by authority.

  
None of this implies sanctifying entrepreneurs or assuming markets are flawless. The Hayekian defense is not of the people who participate, but of the mechanism that disciplines their mistakes. When we demand to “replace” that mechanism with political will, we are usually asking that the costs of our preferences fall on others: for accounting to disappear but abundance to remain.

  
How do we escape the paradox? With three kinds of modesty:

  
**Epistemic modesty:** recognize that no one possesses enough information to conduct the economy like an orchestra.

  
**Institutional modesty:** prefer stable rules to grandiose goals; property and prices over discretion.

  
**Moral modesty:** accept that progress comes in iterations, not edicts, and that dignity comes from choosing and erring, not from being administered.

Capitalism doesn’t ask for gratitude; it asks for memory. To forget it is the first step toward replacing a system that corrects errors with one that perpetuates them enthusiastically. And that is the most expensive luxury of all.",1,1760125879.0,Anarcho_Capitalism,0,1.0,False

 Smile transmits many things to the people watching it. Most importantly, it leaves very good impressions with a bright white smile. But teeth undergo discolouration with time caused by many factors like age, diet, or lifestyle. If you are aiming at revitalizing your beautiful smile, it should be dental whitening. Dental whitening guide

Get to know everything about dental whitening-right from how it works, the time before and during the procedure to what can happen thereafter. Dental whitening guide

# 1. Understanding Dental Whitening

Dental whitening is popularly called teeth whitening. Dental whitening is a cosmetic procedure to lighten the color of teeth and to remove stains and discoloration from their surfaces using chemical agents that typically include hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide for their teeth whitening effect. Although dental whitening will not change the physical structure of teeth, it certainly makes your smile much better and more attractive and gives you the extra confidence. Dental whitening guide

# 2. Common Causes of Tooth Discoloration

Before diving into whitening treatments, it’s important to understand the causes of tooth discoloration. These include:

* **Dietary Choices:** Foods and drinks like coffee, tea, red wine, and berries can stain teeth over time. Dental whitening guide
* **Smoking:** Tobacco use is a major contributor to yellowing and discoloration.
* **Aging:** As we age, the enamel on our teeth thins, revealing the yellowish dentin beneath.
* **Medications:** Certain antibiotics and other medications can cause discoloration as a side effect. Dental whitening guide
* **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Inadequate brushing and flossing can lead to plaque and stain buildup.

# 3. Types of Dental Whitening Options

There are many ways to whiten the smile, and thus, the choice depends on how white the person wants it, what amount is allocated for this, and the extent of discoloration.

* **In-Office Whitening:** Sleeping, often under the direction of a dentist, is the fastest and most dramatic approach for teeth whitening. A special light or laser activates a high concentration bleaching agent for application in teeth. Dental whitening guide
* **Take-Home Whitening Kits:** This treatment type is carried out by your dentist and consists of professionally made tooth whitening gels plus custom-fitted trays with which one can whiten his teeth at home over some weeks. Dental whitening guide
* **Over-the-Counter Products:** Include whitening strips toothpaste and gels. However the most convenient and less expensive of the three tend to have much less dramatic results than professional treatment. Dental whitening guide

# 4. Preparing for Dental Whitening

Before undergoing any whitening treatment, it’s essential to prepare your teeth to ensure the best results.

* **Schedule a Dental Checkup:** Both dental examination and cleaning would actually entail having a cavity check and a gum examination; then they can also check for other issues that would hinder your whitening procedure. Dental whitening guide
* **Address Existing Dental Issues:** These would be the reasons why whitening would cause sensitivity during the treatment, either naturally occurring or non-untreated carious teeth.
* **Set Realistic Expectations:** Whitening can significantly brighten teeth; however, it cannot guarantee total stain removal because some stains cannot be removed by this method-for example, staining caused by particular medications or just due to trauma to the teeth.

# 5. What to Expect During the Whitening Process

* **In-Office Whitening:** The procedure typically takes 1–2 hours. Your dentist will protect your gums and apply the whitening agent to your teeth, activating it with a light or laser. Results are often visible immediately after the session. Dental whitening guide
* **At-Home Kits:** These require you to wear custom-fitted trays filled with whitening gel for a prescribed amount of time each day. It may take a few weeks to see noticeable results.

# 6. Managing Sensitivity After Whitening

It’s quite normal for the person to have some sensitivity after the teeth whitening treatment. Some pointers to avoid discomfort include:

* Putting on toothpaste meant for sensitive teeth.
* Avoiding hot or cold foods or beverages for say two days after the procedure.
* Carefully following the dentist’s instructions for post-whitening care.

# 7. Maintaining Your Brighter Smile

To keep your bright smile bright, maintenance is going to be important. Here are some tips on how to keep your teeth shining:

* **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush one’s teeth twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste, floss on a regular basis. Dental whitening guide
* **Limit Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit coffee, tea, red wine, and other materials that may stain teeth. If it cannot be avoided, rinse one’s mouth with water afterward.
* **Avoid Smoking:** Tobacco is a major culprit in staining teeth. Quitting can help preserve your whitening results. Dental whitening guide
* **Schedule Regular Cleanings:** Dental professionals perform cleanings on surfaces and keep your teeth healthy and well-maintained. Dental whitening guide
* **Use Touch-Up Treatments:** Your dentist may recommend using touch-up products at specified times, to keep the color of your teeth bright at all times.

# 8. Is Dental Whitening Right for You?

While teeth whitening is suitable for most cases, it may not be appropriate for everyone. The following mentioned conditions require the patient to visit their dentist before applying any whitening:

* Severe sensitivity of the teeth
* Oral Diseases
* Pregnant women or Women who are breastfeeding
* Teeth that have restorations such as crowns or veneers that will not bleach with whitening agents

# Conclusion

Simple dental whitening is an effective way for bringing your smile into brightness and enhancement in confidence should be helpful. Understand the different options, ways of preparation, and post-treatment care that make results last longer and improve your overall appearance. Dental whitening guide

I thought perhaps it was an ovarian cyst (I was diagnosed with PCOS about 12 years ago, so cysts are not uncommon for me), but when I had an ultrasound, it came back clear, indicating it wasn’t reproductive. 

I recently went to a gastroenterologist, because I had a flare up of SIBO symptoms and thought maybe it was related to that. I had a breath test for SIBO maybe two years ago that came back positive, and I’m not sure it ever went away. He ordered a CT scan and it came back clear, besides some cysts on my right ovary, and two very small cysts on my liver and spleen. No explanation for the hardness I’m feeling. Both the obgyn and gastro could feel a “fullness”. 

Nausea is a common symptom I have, as well as fatigue. But neither are debilitating, usually. 

I have been dismissed quite often by doctors, so I don’t know if this is something I should continue to pursue an answer for, or if it’s normal and not a big deal. 

I get bloodwork done every 6 months or so and I see a functional medicine doctor who is treating my hormones. She’s the only one who’s really taken me seriously enough to order tests for things like the SIBO or a sleep study, for example. But, she’s not a specialist for this kind of thing. 

Currently, I take thyroid NP in the morning along with methylphenidate (for adhd), progesterone at night, and just started two units of testosterone injection twice a week. I take vitamin D, berberine, fish oil, and probiotics daily. I also have some green tea first thing in the morning, and a cup of mushroom coffee. I do weight training three times a week and easy runs/walks on the other 3-4 days. I sleep with a cpap. I eat pretty healthy, though carbs like bread, pizza, pasta, etc has made my gut pretty angry recently. I have a family history of diabetes, so I know I’m at risk for that and try to be health conscious. 

ETA: I’m also very regular as far as BMs go. I am not constipated, nor do I ever have diarrhea.

We didn't date long, but he was going through a hard time, and wanted space. I had asked if there was anything I could do or if it was concerning me, and he said no. When he told me he had a lot going on via text, I decided to give him the space and didn't respond. The next day, conveniently after my therapy appointment, it was like he doubled down and texted again like he REALLY needed space, and I took that to mean that he wanted to break up, but didn't have it in him to do it. So I made him pull off the band-aid. I've been upset because I really did not see this coming. I tried to talk to him after the conversation we had telling him I did not intend to give an ultimatum, it wasn't what I wanted, but his pulling away made me feel hurt and confused and just rejected. He responded that he was okay with me breaking up with him (though I didn't), thanks.   
It's only been a week, and I've been thinking of texting him in maybe a month or so telling him I do not want to get back together (there's a lot of reasons like distance and a messy court situation) but I do still care about him and hope we could check in with each other once in awhile. Like not even meet for a drink/coffee at first.   
I'm hoping that in about a month I'll have more clarity on what it is I really want from him, maybe I'll be dating someone else, maybe I'll be too busy to date in general, maybe I'll have even forgotten I felt like this.

I (21F) recently started online dating in pursuit of a relationship, and there’s a guy (23M) I’ve been texting for a few weeks. He seems kind, smart, funny, and his messages have always felt really genuine unlike most of the guys I’ve matched on the app. He frequently asks me questions, and we’ve talked about a wide range of topics and shared a lot of thoughts.

At some point, he asked if I wanted to grab a coffee next week, and I said yes, so we made plans. 

The thing is, our conversations so far have felt super platonic, even serious at times when we’re on topics such as politics, and there’s been basically no flirting at all. I did find the texts pleasant and constructive but honestly didn’t think he’d ask to meet in person, since we’ve been chatting for weeks without any real signs of romantic interest. In case I was being dense, I showed part of the texts to my friend and she asked me if I was talking with a professor or something… 

Maybe he’s just shy or being cautious, but I’m not sure whether I should think of this as an actual date (like, maybe he is interested in me?) or if it’s just a friendly coffee chat with no romantic intention behind it.

What do you think I should expect?

1o3ao46,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o3ao46/the_moon_woke_up_part_i/,The Moon Woke Up ~ PART I,"When I close my eyes, I still see Earth burning. I see the skyline of Chicago crumbling under its own smoke, the color of blood diluted in rust and ash. The sun hasn’t looked right since the war, and maybe that’s why they picked me—someone who had nothing left worth losing. The year was 2062 when the world finally admitted it was dying. Maybe we all knew before that, but humans are experts at pretending the ground isn’t splitting beneath their feet.

I’m an astronautical engineer by training, but out here, titles are just words that lost their gravity. My name’s Ethan Hale. Forty-three years old. Father of one. Widower, though that word doesn’t mean much anymore when most of the world has been widowed by fire and fallout. My wife, Lydia, was gone long before the war. Cancer. My daughter, Emma—she made it to eight. That was before the air outside our city got so thick with radiation that her little lungs started to shut down. I remember sitting by her bed, the monitors stuttering with each fading breath, her skin pale as moonlight. That was when I decided I’d go if they asked. I’d go anywhere the air was clean. I’d find a world she could have lived on, even if I’d never see it myself.

There are six of us on the *Horizon*. Six remnants of what humanity used to be. We were sent up a year ago—if time still means what it used to. Days blur together when you’re counting oxygen instead of hours. We were supposed to find something—anything—that could sustain life. But most of space is quiet, and quiet is dangerous. You start to hear your own thoughts echo too loud in your skull.

I share a small module with Jensen, our mission pilot. He’s the egotistical one, if you ask anyone who’s been stuck with him longer than a meal cycle. Always talking about how he “could’ve led this mission better” or how “command doesn’t understand real flight dynamics.” He’s brilliant, sure—ace pilot, top of his training class—but he’s the kind of man who can’t stand silence unless it’s filled with his own voice. He shaved his head before we launched, said he didn’t want “stray hairs in zero-g.” I think he just liked seeing his reflection on the metal panels—clean, flawless, untouchable.

Then there’s Varga. Big man. Burn scars up his neck and across half his jaw. He never talks about how he got them, and none of us ask. You can tell it’s something to do with the war, though—he’s got that look in his eyes, like he’s already been to hell and didn’t find it impressive. He handles the maintenance work, the grunt labor, things that make the rest of us flinch. He doesn’t flinch at anything. Once, during a decompression drill, a hatch door slammed shut on his arm. He didn’t make a sound. Just waited until I pried it open and muttered, “Still works.” That was Varga in three words.

Our scientist—Dr. Mei Lin—keeps to herself. The smart one. If there’s anything worth knowing about a planet’s atmosphere, soil, or water, she knows it before the sensors do. Mei’s not unkind, but she’s not built for small talk either. Her voice is calm, even when things go wrong. Especially when they go wrong. I’ve caught her humming sometimes, quietly, when she runs diagnostics. Some old Mandarin tune. It makes the lab feel less like a coffin.

The yapper’s name is Suarez. Youngest of the crew—twenty-six, I think. Talks enough for all of us combined. He used to be a communications officer in the Brazilian navy before the collapse, but he talks like someone who’s never been heard in his life. He keeps asking if I think we’ll ever go home. I never know how to answer him. Not because I don’t want to, but because “home” isn’t really a place anymore.

And then there’s Fischer—the joker. German, or maybe Austrian. He tells jokes that would get him punched back on Earth, if Earth still had bars and beer and laughter to spare. Once told Mei that if we crash-landed, he’d “gladly repopulate humanity” with her. She didn’t even look up from her data pad, just said, “Statistically improbable,” and kept typing. I laughed harder than I should have. You start to crave any sound that isn’t mechanical hum or your own heartbeat.

We left Earth under a sky that looked bruised. The launch was chaotic, improvised. Half our equipment was secondhand military tech, the rest scavenged from old NASA reserves. There was no glory in it. No waving flags. Just a final, desperate reach for something that wasn’t dying. Command didn’t even call it a colonization mission anymore—they called it “Resource Continuity Exploration.” As if finding a rock with breathable air could erase the taste of radiation and guilt.

The first few months were simple enough. We were still pretending this was noble. We’d wake up, check systems, run scans, make coffee that tasted like battery acid. We laughed sometimes. We played cards in zero gravity. Suarez taught us a stupid song from his childhood, and for a few days, it almost felt human again. Then the boredom crept in—the silence, the sameness. When you spend long enough staring into black, the black starts to stare back.

I keep Emma’s photo in my chest pocket. Always. It’s wrinkled, edges curled, the ink faded from the recycled air. Her hair’s in pigtails, her smile gap-toothed, the sky behind her a blue that doesn’t exist anymore. Sometimes, I talk to it. Not out loud. Just in my head. “We’re still looking, kiddo,” I tell her. “We’ll find it.” I don’t say that I’m starting to think there’s nothing out here worth finding.

We’re three days into orbit around a moon that doesn’t appear on any known star chart. No atmosphere, or so we thought. But our sensors have been glitching. Oxygen spikes. Temperature inconsistencies. Mei says it’s impossible. Varga says impossible doesn’t mean shit in space. Jensen thinks it’s a system error. Fischer says maybe it’s ghosts. Suarez just wants to go home.

The moon hung there, a gray coin against a black sea. It wasn’t much to look at—pitted, dry, inert. But I found myself staring anyway. Maybe it was the stillness that drew me in. After a year of constant movement—fans humming, systems cycling, air filters sighing—the idea of something so perfectly motionless felt almost holy.

I sat in the observation module long after the others had drifted to their quarters. The hum of the station was softer here. A few indicator lights pulsed gently, the color of dying embers. I could hear the slow rhythmic pop of the thermal panels adjusting to temperature shifts, metal expanding, contracting. It almost sounded like breathing. I pretended it was Earth, still alive, still trying.

The viewport glass was smudged from fingerprints. Mine, probably. We don’t get new cleaning cloths until resupply, and resupply hasn’t been a word that means anything in months. I stared at my own reflection until it blurred into the cratered surface beyond. The moonlight, faint as it was, carved out the lines on my face, made the gray in my beard look silver. I looked older than forty-three. Out here, we all do.

I used to tell Emma that space wasn’t empty—it was waiting. Waiting for someone brave enough to wake it up. She believed me, back when bedtime stories still meant something. Now, I’m not sure if I was lying to her or to myself.

Behind me, the air recycler clicked off and restarted, a soft mechanical cough that reminded me we were only alive because of moving parts. Everything here hums or whirs or vibrates—tiny reminders that silence means death. Even our sleep is noisy.

I heard footsteps. Jensen again, by the sound of it—he walks like the ship belongs to him.  
“You’re still staring at that rock?” he said. His voice always carries an undertone of amusement, even when he’s dead serious.

“Can’t sleep,” I said without turning.

“Yeah, none of us can. That’s what happens when you circle nothing for too long.” He came closer, hands folded behind his back like some kind of commander in a propaganda film. “You know, Earth Command probably forgot about us months ago. We could be floating here for years and they’d never send retrieval.”

“Wouldn’t make much difference,” I said. “Nothing left to go back to.”

He made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a snort. “Maybe that’s the point. No home to return to means no reason to stop searching. Efficient, if you think about it.”

That was Jensen’s gift—turning despair into logistics.

After he left, I stayed seated. I could still smell his aftershave—synthetic citrus, rationed and bitter. It didn’t cover the scent of recycled air. Nothing does.

Later, Varga came through for his shift check. He nodded to me once, didn’t ask why I was there. He doesn’t ask questions unless they need answers. His hands were wrapped in the same bandages he’s been reusing for months, smudged with grease and disinfectant. He moved like a man whose bones remembered gravity.

“System check?” I asked.

“All green,” he said. His voice was deep, the kind that could fill a hangar without trying. He looked out the viewport for a long time, his reflection cutting against mine. “Ugly thing,” he said finally.

“What, the moon?”

He shrugged. “Everything looks ugly when it’s dead.”

That was the longest conversation we’d had in weeks.

When he left, I pulled the photo from my pocket. Emma’s smile caught the light, the edges of her curls illuminated by a sun that probably doesn’t reach Earth anymore. I traced the curve of her cheek with my thumb, trying to remember what her laughter sounded like without the rasp in her lungs. It’s strange, the things you forget first. You’d think it would be her face, but no. The mind keeps the image. It’s the sound that fades.

Sometimes, I think that’s what the universe is—a giant silence, collecting all the sounds we’ve lost.

Mei Lin joined me just before the next rotation cycle. She moves quietly, like she’s afraid to disturb the air. She handed me a cup of water—real water, not the flavored reconstitution mix we usually ration. “You should rest,” she said.

“Can’t.”

“You’ll burn out.”

“Already did,” I said, but softly enough that I wasn’t sure if she heard.

She sat beside me for a while, not saying anything. Her gaze was fixed on the lunar surface. “There’s something peaceful about it,” she murmured. “Uncomplicated. No politics, no borders. Just rock.”

“Rock’s all we’ve got left,” I said.

She smiled faintly. “Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.”

I wanted to tell her she was wrong—that it was a terrible thing, that peace without life isn’t peace at all. But I didn’t. I just watched the way her reflection lingered against the glass, her face overlapping the moon’s shadowed horizon until it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began.

Hours passed. I don’t know how many. The artificial lighting in the module dimmed automatically to simulate night, but it never feels like night when the stars are always awake. Suarez’s voice echoed faintly through the corridor somewhere behind me, rapid Spanish mixed with laughter. Probably talking to Fischer. Their friendship had turned into a kind of survival mechanism—noise warding off the dark.

I envied them.

The moon didn’t move. Or maybe it did, and I just didn’t notice anymore. It had that kind of gravity—the quiet kind that pulls your thoughts inward until you forget to breathe. Its craters looked deeper the longer I stared, like wells that had swallowed all their light.

I wondered how many men before me had stared at something like that and felt the same thing—the slow erosion of meaning, the gentle ache of knowing you’re both too small and too far gone to matter.

Somewhere deep in the ship, a relay clicked, and the hum of the recyclers dipped for a second. The sudden near-silence startled me more than any alarm could have. Then it resumed, steady as a heartbeat.

Everything was fine. The systems were fine. The crew was fine.

I told myself that a dozen times before I finally stood and turned away from the window.

Before I left, I looked one more time—just one long look at that pale, pitted sphere hanging out there in the void. It looked back the same way it always did. Empty. Still. Unmoved.

I use a Samsung Tab S10+ 5G as an alternative for basic productivity tasks like emails/streaming/scheduling. 

I have a mid spec'd gaming desktop but I barely use it anymore. last time I used it was probably 5 months ago. 

I was using my work laptop to study programming(python, r, etc.)/AI/non work related skill building stuff at coffee shops but now prefer to get a laptop again for my personal projects. 

I was looking at a macbook air 13/15 inch due to pricing($799/$1099), and had decent specs for my use case but I'm here to ask for your help because I still prefer thinkpads and want to have a laptop that is 4G, 5G capable. 

I've been on the lenovo site and seems like if I spec'd out t14s amd gen 6, x13 latest gen, and x12 gen 2 detachable they are roughly around the same price. Would prefer the Snapdragon but right now pricing is in the higher end than when I spec'd it out last year ~$1550 last year vs $1800 with taxes this year, which matches the t14s amd gen 5, x13, and x12 gen 2. 

I spec'd a t14s gen 6 and t14 intel, they cost more than the t14s gen 6 amd (AMD 7, 32gb, 256gb ssd, 4G lte) which i was leaning more towards. 

My account has workplace savings. I do have two questions.

Which amongst the 3 will you choose? T14s gen 6 amd, x13 latest gen or x12 detachable.

Should I wait for BF deals for CTO? Will the Snapdragon model be cheaper at that time? 

Basic programming so maybe battery over performance would be my need.",1,1760124841.0,thinkpad,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately do not speak Chinese :(. 

Any tips on what to do?

* Food/fine dining: 
   * Would like to try local specialities. From what I understand, food in SZ is similarish to Cantonese food in HK, but if there are any notable dishes or restaurants, please let me know! 
   * Would like to try an example of Chinese fine dining. Was thinking of [Ensue](https://www.ensue-sz.com/), but not sure if this is a good representative of modern Chinese fine dining or is more generic ""international"" cuisine. Any thoughts?
* Tech
   * I'm a lawyer at a late-stage startup in SF, but am very interested in learning more about the Chinese tech scene.
   * Will wander around Huaqiangbei. Any cool museums, attractions, or company stores I should visit to see the latest in Chinese tech?
* Gay stuff
   * Would like to see the gay scene in SZ and was thinking of checking out AtTheMoment if anything is going on next week (Oct 18-20).
   * Any other recs?
* Other standard touristy things I'm considering:
   * Shenzhen Bay Park, OCT Loft, Window of the World
   * Any nice spas?

I have literally spent $100's trying different adhesives, some exotic ones picked up by a friend traveling Europe, and had just started looking into implants as I couldn't imagine fighting with trying to eat the rest of my life.

My denturist lead me to believe I had to relearn how to eat differently. I was also supposed to relearn how to speak since I've had a lisp I couldn't shake. This has been going on since March 2025. But why would I question her since I don't know any different. I've never had dentures before (perms btw).

The new dentist I went to for a consultation in implants was very honest and told me the bite was so far off there was no point looking further into implants until my dentures were fixed properly.

He took new impressions, for which he did not even charge me, and essentially had my teeth rebuilt from scratch. I wasn't thrilled with having to go through the whole process again but man, was it worth it.

I've learned now that if you're dentures are designed and fit properly, you don't need to mess around with all the adhesive experimentation, not to mention, I don't have to learn a new way to eat. I can eat like a normal human and my bottoms don't pop out. I can drink hot coffee. And they don't hurt at all. The tops need no adhesive whatsoever. And if I'm not trying to eat anything too challenging, I can get away without adhesive on the bottoms without having them flop around when I speak.

And no lisp anymore either so after being lead to believe all these issues were me and I had to get used to them, I discover I was being gaslit over poor fitting dentures.

So if any of my issues sound familiar to you, stop the suffering, stop believing that YOU have to adapt. You don't. You have ill fitting dentures.

I could've gone the rest of my life fighting with them, paid thousands more for implants (which I don't think I'm going to need now), and all because I wouldn't have known better. Demand your denturist get your teeth perfect, (or go elsewhere if you can), cause none of us should be having these issues. 

Maintain hope cause it's NOT you. I hope this helps someone so you're not stuck like I thought I was. Very grateful for the new dentist who took the time to fix my dentures even though he probably lost out on implant income.",5,1760124530.0,dentures,2,1.0,False

1o3afwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1o3afwm/how_i_beat_bloodsugar_induced_anxiety/,How I beat blood-sugar induced anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something close to my heart today, because I know so many of us here are struggling with anxiety and high blood glucose. For years, I've struggled with anxiety that kept me up at night, low testosterone, and a family tendency toward high blood glucose that made every meal feel like a risk. On top of that, my hair started shedding more than usual. I was trying random stacks but i did not continue with most of the supplements because many had no perceived effects.

What frustrated me most was how one-size-fits-all advice you find on social media did not work. I read about ashwagandha for stress (later I learned that it was liver toxic) or fedogia agrestis for testosterone, but without considering my unique biology, interactions, or timing, so it was a guessing game hard to measure.

That struggle pushed me to try so many supplement to get over my issues (mostly anxiety). I spent countless hours poring over studies, tracking my blood work, and experimenting carefully. Slowly, I pieced together a protocol that worked:   
\- proper nutrition to stabilize glucose (near ketogenic),   
\- morning weight training to boost testosterone naturally,   
\- going to bed everyday on time (10pm),   
\- targeted supplements to fill the gaps  
  
Things like creatine, tongkat ali, cayenne pepper and most importantly cinnamon made a massive difference for me. The key was personalization and tracking, i had to adjust doses based on my bloodwork results and how I felt day to day. I kept everything in an my supplement tracker.

**My routine:**

Breakfast:  
\- 4 eggs with cayenne pepper  
\- Black coffee with 10g creatine and 1g cinnamon  
\- 1g of tongkat ali

Lunch:  
\- Black coffee with 1g cinnamon

My anxiety is gone, my testosterone levels climbed back up, I felt way calmer, my blood glucose stayed steady without crashes, and best of all, the hair shedding stopped completely. 

I am so happy i found that combo to beat my anxiety. It took me years of trying to find that out. I hope it will help some of you struggling with seemingly incurable anxiety.   
  
Please let me know if that works for you as well.

1o3aea5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1o3aea5/anyone_else_deal_with_a_severe_morning_crash/,"Anyone else deal with a severe morning ""crash"" after breakfast? Looking for advice!","I'm dealing with a really frustrating issue and I'm hoping someone here might have some insight or similar experience.

My main symptom is a huge ""crash"" in the morning, about an hour after I finish breakfast. This crash hits me hard: I get extreme shakiness and hunger, and I can't concentrate until I get food in me immediately.

My Typical Morning Timeline:

Breakfast (within 1 hour of waking): I'm usually starving and eat everything quickly. I will usually have a homemade muffin, a banana, and avocado toast with eggs. Also coffee with creamer.
 
About 60-90 minutes later, the crash hits. I usually have to down an apple as fast as I can to stop the shakiness.
It's absolutely exhausting living like this. I have to make sure I carry a snack with me everywhere I go, especially in the mornings, because I know there will be an inevitable ""sugar crash.""

I saw a nurse today, and she told me my blood sugars were in the normal range, but she had tested me right after I ate, which I know isn't the best time for identifying post-meal drops. I bought myself a glucose meter so I can start testing myself consistently for two weeks to see what's happening.

Has anyone dealt with this kind of pattern before? Any suggestions for how to structure my breakfast to prevent this severe drop? Should I be focusing on reducing carbs or increasing protein/fat at that meal? Any advice on what kind of numbers to look out for on my new meter would also be appreciated!",2,1760124298.0,Hypoglycemia,1,1.0,False
1o3advo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3advo,"TRIP REPORT: 10 days Peru -- Explora Valle Sagrado, Belmond Palacio Nazarenas, JW Marriott Lima","Just got back from 10 nights in Peru: 4 nights Explora Valle Sagrado, 3 nights Belmond Palacio Nazarenes, and 1 night JW Lima (even though I booked 3 nights). Reviews and commentary below, including what you need to know about Machu Picchu that I didn't know, but wish I did. 

All images are of Explora except for the one from the balcony at the Belmond.

# Explora Valle Sagrado Review

**Setting**  
Way the fuck out of Urubamba, near a small pueblo called Urquillos. Think dirt roads. Farm village. Its isolation is its virtue.

I can’t overstate it: The setting is simply sublime. It sits on a working farm, surrounded by small homes and open countryside. The entire vista frames huge Andean peaks, often with moody morning fog. I genuinely think the setting alone is worth the stay. Incredibly peaceful. A real sense of place.

Other resorts nearer Urubamba couldn’t possibly have this feel. If you’re game for long, bumpy drives to and from the train or town, this is the place.

**The Explora Vibe**  
Explora nails its purpose. This is for people who come to hike, climb, and explore — 15,000-foot peaks, ATVs, the whole deal. Guests show up to dinner in hiking pants and Patagonia fleece. It’s a specific vibe and a specific crowd. You’re either into it or you’re not.

That also means the resort skips a lot of the trappings chubby travelers usually expect:

* No room service
* No coffee in the room
* No poolside service
* Restaurant with limited menus at limited hours

Most guests are gone all day anyway, so the countryside *is* the amenity.

**Rooms**  
Comfortable, minimalist, leaning slightly rustic but not rough at all. “Eco-lodge” fits. The only place to get coffee is the main restaurant.

So yeah, if you’re looking for spoiled luxury, this ain’t it. But if you can lean into the vibe and the sense of place, this might be one of the best stays you’ll ever have.

**Dining**  
This was the surprise. Limited menu because everything’s sourced locally and based on what’s fresh. But the food was spectacular — every single meal. Presentation was Michelin-grade: earthy ceramics, stone butter slabs, thoughtful plating. I honestly can’t imagine anywhere nearby doing it better. Four nights, four knockout dinners.

**Staff & Atmosphere**  
Consistently warm, friendly, and helpful. Anything we wanted, they made happen. What I really love about Explora is the lack of pretense. It almost leans casual — but more like being in someone’s home.

We left as full-on Explora converts and are already researching which one to visit next.

# Notes on Machu Picchu 

First, it's an absolute slog to get there. You gotta drive to the train. Then take the train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes. The train ride is obviously spectacular, though. Then you queue up in a complete nuthouse line for the busses to the park entrance. Then once you're inside the park it's just roped lines keeping everyone piled together, millions of selfies and photos, constantly.   
  
The whole thing feels like the worst version of crowded Disney World. Whatever wonder or awe or mystery you might expect to feel at the site is just completely ruined by a grotesque mass of Instagram madness. Beyond painful.  
  
In ten days trip, Machu Picchu was our least favorite day. 

If I had it to do over, I might skip it altogether. If I definitely decided to go, I would pay the logistical and costs to stay at the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge for a chance to visit the park right at open and right at close.   

The site is too compact, and too crowded with people between ropes, to meaningfully enjoy at peak hours. 

# Belmond Palacio Nazarenes Review

**Setting**  
Right in the heart of Cusco, tucked into a small square. Off-the-charts vibes. We had a city studio suite with a balcony overlooking the pool, the city, and mountains in the distance — just gorgeous.

The hotel itself is a restored convent, and it feels like a museum in the best possible way. Tranquil courtyards, fountains, and little water features everywhere. You can’t walk ten feet without wanting to stop and just take it in. It’s next-level serene. You *feel* like you’re somewhere special.

**Room**  
Unbelievably well equipped. Heated bathroom floors, beautifully wrapped amenities, everything top-quality. Every single touch felt deliberate and thoughtful. Nothing felt mass-produced. It’s one of those rooms where you can tell someone obsessed over every detail.

**Service**  
These people are on another level. Genuinely out-of-control attentive — in the best way. I called the front desk asking for four bath towels. Either I misspoke or they misheard, because two minutes later four bath*robes* arrived. I love that so much. We laughed and fixed it, but I still can’t get over the fact that they didn’t even blink at sending *four bathrobes*.

The butler team runs on WhatsApp and will basically make anything happen. At first, coming straight from Explora’s chill, stripped-down vibe, it all felt a little stiff and performative — but it’s not. They pay close attention. They noticed I liked Acqua Panna and just kept restocking it without me asking.

The free minibar is a great perk too.

**Food**  
Here’s the one miss. For a property this refined, the food was… mid. We did room service a few times because I wasn’t feeling great, and everything was only okay. Breakfast was fine, but the coffee was borderline undrinkable. It’s weird — every other part of the experience is five-star perfection, but the kitchen feels a few notches behind. Maybe the chef was sick too?

# JW Marriott Lima Review

  
**Setting**  
Right in Miraflores, across from a park overlooking the cliffs. Great location — and that’s about where the positives end.

**Room**  
I booked this JW because it was relatively inexpensive and recently refurbished. I know JW quality is usually a step down from the chubby-crowd favorites — and that’s fine. I figured with new interiors, it would be perfectly serviceable since we’d be out exploring most of the time anyway.

But whoever designed these rooms is a complete lunatic. It’s like they’ve never stayed in a hotel before. They used the *same material* for the shower walls as the hallway and bathroom floors. So you get shoe marks, luggage scuffs, and dirt everywhere. The hotel’s been open maybe six months, and the floors already look wrecked. Hard to clean, already stained with coffee and wine spills, just utterly gross.

Then came the real fun. It’s 10 p.m., my wife takes a shower, no contacts in, and realizes the entire bathroom is flooded. There’s no lip or divider between the shower and the rest of the floor, so if the drain clogs even slightly, you’ve got a swamp.

We call maintenance. They confirm it’s broken and offer to move us. Fine. We switch rooms. Test the new shower, seems okay. I shower, we go to bed.

Next morning, I shower again — and boom, flooded bathroom *again*. Didn’t even notice until I stepped out and sloshed through standing water. Completely disgusting.

We call down again. They offer another room change. Hard pass. We decided we were out. 

At checkout, nobody even mentioned it. Just handed me the folio and a “thanks for staying.” Unreal.

**Bottom Line**  
Easily one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had. Horrible property. Stay far away.

**Postscript**  
We switched to the Westin Convention Center afterward. Totally different world. Dated, sure — but solid. Reasonable club lounge, excellent pool and spa, and genuinely kind staff. A much better note to end the trip on. Awesome neighborhood too. 

Not sure I'd recommend it, but light years better than the JW. 

We loved Lima. So, if you're on the fence make time for Lima. Way underrated. ",3,1760124270.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False
1o3ad3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TiredPMPProfessional/comments/1o3ad3o/how_ai_tools_changed_the_way_i_manage_projects/,How AI Tools Changed the Way I Manage Projects (For Real),"For 10 years, I managed projects with spreadsheets, standups, and coffee-fueled chaos.  
Then I started experimenting with **AI tools** — not just for automation, but for real-time insights.

Points that changed for me:  
1. Risk tracking became proactive   
2.  I could summarize 50-page reports in seconds  
3. My team communication improved because AI handled daily status check-ins, notes on Meetings

But here’s the twist — AI didn’t replace me; it *enhanced* me. It gave me back time to focus on leadership, stakeholder management, and creativity — things AI can’t do.

Now I believe:“ A good PM uses AI as a co-pilot, not a competitor.”

Maybe it’s an unexpected present, a heartfelt thank-you, a tiny act of kindness, or a random windfall that left you both shocked and grateful.  

Mine? I once got a handwritten postcard from a stranger after helping them online—still keeps me smiling years later.  
But let’s talk about YOU.

💬 **Share your story below:**  
What’s the best gift you’ve ever received for free? Think deeper—  
- Was it something physical or emotional?  
- Did it change how you saw generosity or gratitude?  
- Would you say that moment inspired you to “pay it forward”?

😄 Some of the most interesting answers might surprise you:  
- That one ⭐ “free” coffee someone bought you when you were having a terrible day.  
- A 🎮 game code that turned into your favorite obsession.  
- A 💌 simple letter that hit you straight in the feels.  
You never really know how much magic a free gift can carry until you think back and realize how much it shaped you.

First thing that greeted me at the campsite was a paper stapled to a tree stump saying Glyphoste (Roundup) treatment had been applied to the lake. I wish there had been something posted at the Byers Lake trailhead where I entered, it would have saved me some energy. I know many lakes in Michigan are treated this way but I did not expect it at a backcountry wilderness area lake.  And I’m sure many here will say it’s absolutely harmless and I’m a treehugging crybaby……maybe, I’m also a Vet and lifelong outdoorsman. 
Anyway, even though it was past the timeframe posted to not use the water, I chose to limit my consumption. Only used enough to hydrate that evening and make coffee in the morning. Then I portaged out. 
Beautiful place but a bit of a bummer. ",5,1760123897.0,CampAndHikeMichigan,2,1.0,False

1o3a6u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1o3a6u4/please_help_me_get_healthy_again/,Please help me get healthy again,"I'm a 41F that developed an ED 2.5 years ago from extreme emotional and mental stress caused from a relationship. When this all began, I lost fifteen pounds in less than one month and I have only gained a couple pounds since and I used to and still do, live off a couple of coffees per day and a few bites of food here and there. As of lately, I feel I can barely even drink coffee anymore in which I would add heavy creamer for extra calories. When I ate/eat it made/makes me feel sick and well you know how hard it is to force yourself to eat. I try to drink nutritional drinks which is difficult and take vitamins but I fear for my health. In the present, the stress is still high but not nearly as bad as in the beginning. I've tried to cut the off relationship many times during this time frame to only be sucked back in (narcissistic police officer) and I thought he would finally leave me alone this time around but I have received 10 voicemails (full mailbox) in the last 5 days as he is blocked as that is the only way he can reach me and the stress is ramping up my anxiety and stress. It is affecting my appetite even more and it really hit me hard when the other day my teen asked me how I could never eat and be so disgusted by food. My Dad is concerned for my health and compares me to the Halloween skeletons. I have also been in therapy for over a year now.  I am also a single mother of 2 teens and don't have support or any friends. Trying to make dinner for my kids is becoming a huge struggle with each passing day. Weekly grocery shopping is dreadful. I am looking for tips to help me gain my appetite and health back. I live in Canada so health care is pretty scarce and my insurance doesn't even have enough coverage for a single appt with a nutritionist. My family doctor says I have anxiety and gave me meds and that's it. The medication makes me lose my appetite as well so no further ahead but I usually only take it at 3am to fall back asleep from walking up with high cortisol. Any advice please on how to eat as even small bites here and there are so difficult?, I'm so sad for myself.",1,1760123814.0,EatingDisorders,1,1.0,False
1o3a6ou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3a6ou,Will Clefairy Line Ruin My Playthrough?,"TL;DR Does Metronome call Super Luck or Hyper Cutter, which specifically grab coffee/corn/etc.? I'm running 6 ingredients forever (maybe unlocking corn someday) and don't want my ultra-powerful Ingredient Magnets nerfed.

Long version:
Ever since I started playing, I've avoided unlocking any but the pictured six ingredients. Ingredient Magnet only supplies ingredients you've unlocked already. This means that with just one Ingredient Magnet Pokémon, I can consistently make Slowpoke Tail Curry/Salad, and I stockpile tons of Slowpoke Tails. It also means that if I unlock more ingredients, I'll dilute the pool for Ingredient Magnet and get fewer Slowpoke Tails overall.

I've temporarily stopped using Cleffa to complete tasks on Fairy berry weeks, due to the recent release of Super Luck, which could give me unwanted Coffee, Sausages, Beans, and Mushrooms, and Hyper Cutter, which would do the same with Corn and Tomato. I haven't been able to find a recent list of skills Metronome can call.

My question is, does anyone know definitively whether Metronome calls these unique skills? Or does it only call a smaller list which is ""safe"" for me?

Thanks in advance, and sleep well, researchers!

1o3a551,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3a551,Halloween / Amber Canyon preview,"Time to take a little bit of a peak into what may be in store for use over the next few weeks. Previously following back to back events we get 2 weeks break (granted these were largely Legendary events still same may apply here). This would bring us nicely to a Halloween event for week starting Oct 27 (we've had Halloween events the last 2 years so I would be suprised if we don't get another this year).

After that, we know Amber Canyon will be available to travel to from Nov 6 which is a Thursday. Wierd right? Not really. Old Gold Power Plant also dropped on a Thursday, with the Opening Event running for 2 weeks on the following Monday, so I expect to see similar here. Save a Ezzz travel ticket if you want to jump over to the new area straight away (or atleast the Sunday night to get a head start on Area bonus). 2 week opening event should then take place from Nov 10, where 3 mons will likely debut (Trapinch and 2 others). Previously these new mons will be encounterable on Greengrass Isle for the opening event period only, then exclusively be available at the new area only.

ICYMI, Amber Canyon will feature the remaining 3 fixed berry types (Bug, Dragon and Poison). Currently our best Berry mons for this combo are Altaria > Butterfree > Arbok, none of which are overly powerful however still worth preparing 1 if you can in the mean time (so maybe divert some of that current Mini Candy Boost).

Also with a new area addition comes an increase in Area Bonus and unlockable Pot Size so start saving those Dream Shards (maybe Halloween event will provide an opportunity to focus that). Also also, so far we've had a new ingredient debut with a new area (Corn with Lapis Lakeside, Coffee with Old Gold Power Plant). A new ingredient typically means ingredient bag expansion so keep an eye out for any announcements of that nature in the lead up to Amber Canyon.

That's about all we know for now. Enjoy some AI generated images of what Amber Canyon may look like in game :)",0,1760123707.0,PokemonSleep,1,0.33,False
1o3a50m,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1o3a50m/prediabetes_diet/,Prediabetes diet,"I was diagnosed prediabetic a few weeks ago and since then I have been doing some reading on the subject

I wanted to check and see if I had the understanding right of what one’s diet should be like

My understanding is,

get rid of any sugary drink ( juice pop, coffee shop drinks)

reduce (or completey get rid of) sweets/candy/deserts or anything high sugar really

Increase fiber, reduce white carbs

if you do have something sweet, you can help offset the damage by having fiber or protien with it

you can have something sugary as long as you keep your daily sugar under 25 grams for women 

avoid eating late at night

reduce saturated fats

I also read that someone can have a something sweet “occasionally” but wasn’t sure what was meant by occasionally, weekly? or more like only on major holidays

1o3a4rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictoLove/comments/1o3a4rb/scheming_midna_and_riju/,Scheming (Midna and Riju),"Riju sat in the café that served as a rendezvous point when her father couldn’t get to the school right away to pick her up. She use to ride the bus but the rides home and occasional coffee stops and the absence of the din of the bus they offered helped her get homework done faster while retaining the lesson. If she didn’t have any homework, she used the time to just breathe and enjoy the pause in her busy schedule. That and who says no to free coffee as her father would get her something before leaving for home. Today was one of those days where she had no homework so she decided to read a book while she waited only to break focus on her book when the bell on the door rang, breaking the silence for a brief second to signal the coming and going of other patrons. She didn’t mind the bell as it wasn’t too obnoxious and it helped her keep track of time and check her phone on her father’s progress.

One ringing of the bell announced the arrival of a familiar face. A woman a half foot taller than Riju if she were to stand up. Her eyes were red and had an air of mischievousness about her though her facial expression was that of confidence. She too was a red head like Riju but hers was more orange like embers a dying campfire and practically glowed like it too. Riju knew this to be Midna. She helped in her school arts department when she found time and that was how they crossed paths from time to time. She also lives in her neighborhood and sometimes helps mentor checks up on Riju in the really rare instances where Mokoto is running super late since being a truck driver doesn’t merit a traditional nine to five shift. Because of this Riju looks up to Midna.

The two locked eyes and Midna winked with a warm smile. She grabbed her drink and walked over to Riju. “Hey, is this seat taken?”

“Hey, Midna.” Riju greeted her back. “Sorry, let me move my stuff out of the way.”

Riju cleared a spot for Midna who then sat down. “I hear congratulations are in order.” Midna started out of the gate.

“Yeah, it’s been four months now but I still am feeling like it hasn’t even happened yet.” Riju said bewildered.

“It’s no small thing to get adopted.” Midna said. “In time it’ll feel as natural as breathing. I’m just glad you don’t have to worry about finding a permanent home again and I couldn’t think of anyone more perfect to adopt you than Mokoto. Although speaking of him, is he running late again today?”

“Yeah.” Riju said nonchalantly since it didn’t bother her. “Got a text from dad just as school let out it’ll be a good hour or so with his usual apologies.”

“Hang on…” Midna said taken aback.

“Yes I said dad.” Riju said knowing what Midna was thinking. “Now that it’s official I say ‘dad’ publicly although it slipped from my tongue before I was adopted.”

“Really?” Midna asked. “How did Mokoto take it the first time?”

“He was stunned in silence for a good minute.” Riju said smiling as she reminisced, “I knew he was in agony as he had to correct me telling me I had to call him by name since he was only a foster parent at the time. Although he was touched and I suspect that was the moment he decided to apply to be my actual guardian.”

“That’s a sweet story.” Midna said genuinely moved “Does it bother you that his job isn’t as consistent as far as hours go? Or that it isn’t an office job?”

“No.”Riju said unsure where the question was coming from. “At first it did bother me a little when I first was placed into his custody, but I learned that he comes back and communicates when he’s delayed. But that was when I never had a place that felt home and it was still new sharing a house with three other people I didn’t know at all. As things became more consistent.”

“I’m glad.” Midna stated. “Also don’t get me wrong, I respect his choice of profession and I know it pays well. I was just seeing how you felt about it. And it seems you’re quite mature in that front. I hope I didn’t upset you.”

“It’s okay.” Riju assured her. “I know you two get along too well for you to ask something like that out of spite. I was just caught off guard because I wasn’t expecting it.”

“That’s good to hear. Did you want something?” Midna offered pointing behind her at the menu.

“I know better than not to refuse,” Riju smirked, “but you know dad’s going to try and pay you back.”

“You should know by now I won’t let him.” Midna said confidently.

“He won’t let it go so easily. He’s stubborn like that.”

“So am I.” Midna said rising from her seat. “Come on.”

The two went to the menu and ordered a drink for themselves and one for Makoto when he arrived. They received their orders and went back to their corner booth.

“My turn for questions.” Riju started.

“Go ahead.” Midna said as she took a sip.

“When are you and dad going to start dating?” Riju asked bluntly.

Midna almost did a spit take but managed to keep the coffee in her mouth contained. She swallowed and after a few coughs to clear her wind pipes, asked “Dating?!”

“I see the way you interact with each other.” Riju explained. “You two get along so well and would make an adorable couple. That and do you not feel the tension between you two?”

Midna blushed slightly, “You noticed that did you?” She said regaining her confident smile.

“I’d have to be my father not to.” Riju said. “Do you want to try?”

“I wouldn’t say no if he asked.” Midna admitted. “I’m surprised someone hasn’t taken him already.

“He’s too oblivious for that.” Riju said. “He may match you in alot of things personality wise, but when it comes to knowing if someone is trying to hit on him, he needs a neon sign and a megaphoned message.”

“I can definitely now see that.” Midna chuckled.

“I did ask him about dating in general and after I convinced him I was okay with it if he did and wasn’t trying to push him in hopes of getting a mother or something like that.”

“What did he say?”

“He appreciated my concern and if the right person comes along at the right time, he would be open to the idea. But for now taking care of me was enough for him.”

“I’m glad he has his priorities straight.” Midna said as she smiled at the answer. Clearly willing to let the subject drop.

But Riju was not quite yet. “Don’t you want to know what he said when I asked about you?”

At that point Mokoto entered the cafe undetected by Midna but Riju saw.

“You are a sinister young lady.” Midna stated admitting she was now curious but unsure if it was okay to hear it. But her curiosity won. “Go on then. You have me intrigued.”

“I would tell you.” Riju said as she wrote down her number on her napkin and slid it over to Midna. “But wouldn’t you want to hear it from him yourself?”

“Wait wha…” Was all Midna could get out before Mokoto found them.

“There you are.” He said with a smile. “Oh! Hey, Midna. What brings you here?”

Midna was too befuddled to answer right away which caused Riju to step in. “Hey, dad. I forgot to get a new book a the store next door.”

“Alright then.” Mokoto said as he started to pick up Riju’s things to leave. But Riju stopped him.

“No it’s fine. I’ll be in and out. We got you coffee. Why don’t you just sit and watch my stuff. You just got off work.”

Totally oblivious, Mokoto sat down, “If you say so.

Riju whispered in Midna’s ear, “Let me know how it goes.”

Midna still somewhat blushing gave her an accusing but grateful expression while whispering back, “You sneaky little…”

“You’re welcome.” Riju said cutting her off. She then walked hurriedly out the cafe to the book store and waited for a bit not knowing she successfully made the spark that would indeed lead to Mokoto and Midna dating and eventually getting married.",2,1760123686.0,FictoLove,0,1.0,False

I’m talking crying, screaming, bin bags at midnight - everything. We kicked him out together, like a mother-daughter power duo. I even helped her pack his stuff into black bags and throw them on the driveway. She swore she was done. Said she’d never let him back through the door again.

Fast forward a few months… guess who’s suddenly “just popping by to talk”? Yeah. Him. At first it was small things. He’d drop off flowers, fix something around the house, bring her coffee. Then one morning, I came downstairs and his toothbrush was back in the bathroom.

I wanted to scream. But Mum acted like it was no big deal. “We’re just seeing how things go,” she said. Except he never left again. Now he’s moved back in. Like officially. His shoes by the door, his jacket on the chair, his gross aftershave everywhere.

And the weirdest part? They’re acting like nothing ever happened. Sunday dinners, movie nights, even inside jokes again. Meanwhile, I’m sitting there trying not to gag because I know what he did.

I love my mum more than anything, but watching her pretend everything’s fine when I know she deserves better - it’s actually breaking my heart. I want to support her, but I can’t stand seeing his face every morning like we didn’t throw him out months ago.

So now I’m just silently counting down the days until it all explodes again. And honestly? I think it will.",1,1760123636.0,GirlieVent,0,1.0,False

1o3a3jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictoHeartbound/comments/1o3a3jz/scheming_midna_and_riju/,Scheming (Midna and Riju),"Riju sat in the café that served as a rendezvous point when her father couldn’t get to the school right away to pick her up. She use to ride the bus but the rides home and occasional coffee stops and the absence of the din of the bus they offered helped her get homework done faster while retaining the lesson. If she didn’t have any homework, she used the time to just breathe and enjoy the pause in her busy schedule. That and who says no to free coffee as her father would get her something before leaving for home. Today was one of those days where she had no homework so she decided to read a book while she waited only to break focus on her book when the bell on the door rang, breaking the silence for a brief second to signal the coming and going of other patrons. She didn’t mind the bell as it wasn’t too obnoxious and it helped her keep track of time and check her phone on her father’s progress.

One ringing of the bell announced the arrival of a familiar face. A woman a half foot taller than Riju if she were to stand up. Her eyes were red and had an air of mischievousness about her though her facial expression was that of confidence. She too was a red head like Riju but hers was more orange like embers a dying campfire and practically glowed like it too. Riju knew this to be Midna. She helped in her school arts department when she found time and that was how they crossed paths from time to time. She also lives in her neighborhood and sometimes helps mentor checks up on Riju in the really rare instances where Mokoto is running super late since being a truck driver doesn’t merit a traditional nine to five shift. Because of this Riju looks up to Midna.

The two locked eyes and Midna winked with a warm smile. She grabbed her drink and walked over to Riju. “Hey, is this seat taken?”

“Hey, Midna.” Riju greeted her back. “Sorry, let me move my stuff out of the way.”

Riju cleared a spot for Midna who then sat down. “I hear congratulations are in order.” Midna started out of the gate.

“Yeah, it’s been four months now but I still am feeling like it hasn’t even happened yet.” Riju said bewildered.

“It’s no small thing to get adopted.” Midna said. “In time it’ll feel as natural as breathing. I’m just glad you don’t have to worry about finding a permanent home again and I couldn’t think of anyone more perfect to adopt you than Mokoto. Although speaking of him, is he running late again today?”

“Yeah.” Riju said nonchalantly since it didn’t bother her. “Got a text from dad just as school let out it’ll be a good hour or so with his usual apologies.”

“Hang on…” Midna said taken aback.

“Yes I said dad.” Riju said knowing what Midna was thinking. “Now that it’s official I say ‘dad’ publicly although it slipped from my tongue before I was adopted.”

“Really?” Midna asked. “How did Mokoto take it the first time?”

“He was stunned in silence for a good minute.” Riju said smiling as she reminisced, “I knew he was in agony as he had to correct me telling me I had to call him by name since he was only a foster parent at the time. Although he was touched and I suspect that was the moment he decided to apply to be my actual guardian.”

“That’s a sweet story.” Midna said genuinely moved “Does it bother you that his job isn’t as consistent as far as hours go? Or that it isn’t an office job?”

“No.”Riju said unsure where the question was coming from. “At first it did bother me a little when I first was placed into his custody, but I learned that he comes back and communicates when he’s delayed. But that was when I never had a place that felt home and it was still new sharing a house with three other people I didn’t know at all. As things became more consistent.”

“I’m glad.” Midna stated. “Also don’t get me wrong, I respect his choice of profession and I know it pays well. I was just seeing how you felt about it. And it seems you’re quite mature in that front. I hope I didn’t upset you.”

“It’s okay.” Riju assured her. “I know you two get along too well for you to ask something like that out of spite. I was just caught off guard because I wasn’t expecting it.”

“That’s good to hear. Did you want something?” Midna offered pointing behind her at the menu.

“I know better than not to refuse,” Riju smirked, “but you know dad’s going to try and pay you back.”

“You should know by now I won’t let him.” Midna said confidently.

“He won’t let it go so easily. He’s stubborn like that.”

“So am I.” Midna said rising from her seat. “Come on.”

The two went to the menu and ordered a drink for themselves and one for Makoto when he arrived. They received their orders and went back to their corner booth.

“My turn for questions.” Riju started.

“Go ahead.” Midna said as she took a sip.

“When are you and dad going to start dating?” Riju asked bluntly.

Midna almost did a spit take but managed to keep the coffee in her mouth contained. She swallowed and after a few coughs to clear her wind pipes, asked “Dating?!”

“I see the way you interact with each other.” Riju explained. “You two get along so well and would make an adorable couple. That and do you not feel the tension between you two?”

Midna blushed slightly, “You noticed that did you?” She said regaining her confident smile.

“I’d have to be my father not to.” Riju said. “Do you want to try?”

“I wouldn’t say no if he asked.” Midna admitted. “I’m surprised someone hasn’t taken him already.

“He’s too oblivious for that.” Riju said. “He may match you in alot of things personality wise, but when it comes to knowing if someone is trying to hit on him, he needs a neon sign and a megaphoned message.”

“I can definitely now see that.” Midna chuckled.

“I did ask him about dating in general and after I convinced him I was okay with it if he did and wasn’t trying to push him in hopes of getting a mother or something like that.”

“What did he say?”

“He appreciated my concern and if the right person comes along at the right time, he would be open to the idea. But for now taking care of me was enough for him.”

“I’m glad he has his priorities straight.” Midna said as she smiled at the answer. Clearly willing to let the subject drop.

But Riju was not quite yet. “Don’t you want to know what he said when I asked about you?”

At that point Mokoto entered the cafe undetected by Midna but Riju saw.

“You are a sinister young lady.” Midna stated admitting she was now curious but unsure if it was okay to hear it. But her curiosity won. “Go on then. You have me intrigued.”

“I would tell you.” Riju said as she wrote down her number on her napkin and slid it over to Midna. “But wouldn’t you want to hear it from him yourself?”

“Wait wha…” Was all Midna could get out before Mokoto found them.

“There you are.” He said with a smile. “Oh! Hey, Midna. What brings you here?”

Midna was too befuddled to answer right away which caused Riju to step in. “Hey, dad. I forgot to get a new book a the store next door.”

“Alright then.” Mokoto said as he started to pick up Riju’s things to leave. But Riju stopped him.

“No it’s fine. I’ll be in and out. We got you coffee. Why don’t you just sit and watch my stuff. You just got off work.”

Totally oblivious, Mokoto sat down, “If you say so.

Riju whispered in Midna’s ear, “Let me know how it goes.”

Midna still somewhat blushing gave her an accusing but grateful expression while whispering back, “You sneaky little…”

“You’re welcome.” Riju said cutting her off. She then walked hurriedly out the cafe to the book store and waited for a bit not knowing she successfully made the spark that would indeed lead to Mokoto and Midna dating and eventually getting married.",1,1760123611.0,FictoHeartbound,0,1.0,False

-Bit of pain under bottom left rib. 
-Feeling full up
-Lots of gas around the left bottom rib and improves when eating. 
- Some Nausea 
- Can be quite intense back pressure around mid back area 
- sometimes difficult to catch breath and horse a cough which sounds like GERD. 

I spoke to a dr and they put me on ppi for 3 months and I’ve been cutting out alcohol, some foods and coffee etc. 

But I’m still get the symptoms and lately it’s got worse, so not sure if it is gastritis or maybe lower down and ibs. Drs haven’t been a lot of help and no referral to a gastrointestinal doc.

1o3a2pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1o3a2pc/update_from_scan/,Update from scan,"

UPDATE, I posted several days ago about an ultrasound finding of fatty liver despite eating very healthy, no alcholol, no smoking. I had a second ultrasound with liver elastography - below is what it said, should I be worried? I already don't eat processed foods, never eat out, sugars are mainly from fruit and a vegetarian diet with vegetables, whole grains, gluten free (mostly quinoa), small portions of nuts, avocados, greek yogurt, chia seeds, decaf black coffee, green and black tea so I can't really change much of what I eat.-weight 115 lbs. I exercise daily and have never been a drinker or smoker. According to the report, does it mean from the fist scan it has increased when it says ""Diffuse mild increased liver parenchymal echogenicity with decreased through-transmission compatible with fatty infiltration"" I've been trying to exercise more since the first ultrasound, but don't know what else I can do. I did also cut out using turmeric since there is some new evidence too much can damage the liver - I was using about 1 tablespoon a day cooking which seems to much when I looked it up, especially since i used it with black pepper. That was the only possible culprit I could come up with, but if it has increased it doesn't seem to be the problem. I was taking vit d 3 days a week 1000 mg but stopped it also (my levels are low). The only meds I take are synthroid for Hashimotos thyroid.  Because I already do the things it says to do in order to reverse it, I am wondering if something more serious might be causing it? Thanks for any input

""Liver: The liver is normal in size measuring 14.5 cm craniocaudal length. Diffuse mild increased liver parenchymal echogenicity with decreased through-transmission compatible with fatty infiltration. No focal hepatic lesion. Main portal vein and hepatic veins are patent, with appropriate direction of flow. Liver stiffness measurements were obtained on a GE machine using a C1-6 probe following the SRU guidelines. 12 measurements were obtained using a 2D SWE method.

1o3a2dw,https://i.redd.it/65ry0s3y2cuf1.jpeg,I missed my grandpas final moments by about 10 minutes,"My grandpa died last year, he was always my biggest fan and I loved and looked up to him more than anyone ever. I went to visit when he was sick in the hospital, stayed a few days to see him get moved into hospice care at his house he built. I then drove home about 3 hours away to get to work on time. 

I stayed a few days at home to work, then got the call in the middle of my shift I needed to leave and come back to be with family. I stopped for a bathroom break and got a coffee because I was groggy….took about 15 minutes. I’ve regretted that stop for more than a year now…I just wanted to talk to him one last time. He had passed by the time I arrived to his house, all my other family was with him. He was still warm to the touch and I kissed his forehead and held his hand. 

My mom said there was an owl that would visit a day or two before he passed. We’d never seen an owl on the family property before. 
He was a farmer, and there had been a pretty severe drought in the weeks leading up to his passing. He was so worried about his cows and their babies. Around the time he passed, the cows had made their way up to the house, which was odd because they always stayed in the barn after 7/8pm. It was a little after 8pm and the cows came mooing. A few minutes after that, the thunder started rolling and the rain started pouring. 

His death was one of the hardest for me, ever. He was the grandparent I was closest to. Is there anything he wants to tell me? Sometimes I think I see signs but idk if it’s just my brain trying to calm me. ",2,1760123536.0,psychics,2,1.0,False

1o3a1cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1o3a1cs/m34_kentuckyanywhere_looking_for_that_special/,M34 Kentucky/Anywhere Looking for That Special Someone.,"I’m hoping to find that special someone I can spend the rest of my life with. My health hasn’t been the best, but it’s getting better.

I’m working on getting a routine down so I can workout regularly again. I’m studying to learn code to advance my long term career goals further. And I’m currently writing a novel. I want someone who can see that while I’m not perfect, I am trying my best to work at my life and to be a better me.

I’ve spent most my life feeling alone due to health complications. I want a chance at happiness with someone regardless of my weaknesses.

One thing you’ll find with me is genuine honesty. I might sometimes be blunt, but I’ll never sugarcoat things typically. That means you’ll have someone who’s trustworthy, and someone who will want to help you be the best you can be too.

I’m pretty big with nerdy things like anime, video games, tcg's, and ttprg's.

Music and art is something I really love. A fond memory of mine was seeing Phantom of the Opera on broadway as a senior in high school. I typically practice singing pretty regularly. I also played the trumpet growing up. I was considered to be a virtuoso as a teen. I did some acting, and was always involved with art courses like painting or creative writing.

I have a dream to finally get a black belt in Shaolin-do one day. I want to work on general fitness again so I can return to classes.

Oh, and I’ve been making handcrafted coffee and tea for close to four years now. I’m particularly proficient with pour over coffee.

I was taught growing up how to be self sufficient. Cleaning, cooking, house repairs, furniture and electronic work, that sort of thing.

I really wanna find someone who is genuine, loyal, kind, mature, and warm to be around. Someone I can be vulnerable with. Someone I can share my life and dreams with. Someone to explore the world and I can support. Someone I can make smile and laugh.

p.s. I'm still looking if I haven't deleted this post.

So, there I am, all dressed up in my cotton saree, feeling like a Bengali heroine. I’ve got my jhola bag, earphones blasting Rabindra Sangeet, and I’m ready to tackle the rush-hour chaos. But, turns out, I wasn’t ready at all.

Picture this: I’m packed into the metro like a sardine. There’s an uncle with a briefcase taking up half my breathing space, a guy with cologne stronger than my morning coffee, and me just trying to survive. Every time the train jerks, someone’s elbow grazes me, my pallu starts slipping, my bangles are jingling like they’re in a band, and I’m trying to keep it together. My brain’s like, “You’re fine, just stay calm,” but my inner drama queen is throwing a Bollywood tantrum.

I stand there, mentally counting mishti to stay sane – rosogolla, sandesh, mishti doi – while trying not to glare at the manspreading uncle. It’s like the metro and I are in this silent battle, reminding me that being a woman in public is... an adventure.

Finally, when I get off at Park Street, I head straight for a phuchka stall. That spicy tamarind water was the therapy I didn’t know I needed. Survived the metro madness, but now I’m just laughing at how dramatic the whole thing was.

So, anyone else had a metro moment where your saree (or dupatta) betrayed you? How do you keep cool when the crowd’s too close and your outfit’s not cooperating? And what’s your go-to comfort snack after surviving public transport chaos? Let me know – I need to know I’m not the only one! 💃",2,1760123409.0,AskIndianWomen,1,1.0,False

I’ve endured her abuse for years and now that she’s disabled she only has me to take care of her but that comes with the price of living with her and having to deal with her absolute mind boggling cruelty and abuse. A little background we had to move out of her son’s house that had his wife and kids because he was also an abuser towards me AND HER!! I heard her talking today and she told her sister that she’s okay with him and hates me? ALL IVE DONE MY WHOLE LIFE IS CARE ABOUT THIS WOMAN AND PUT MY WHOLE LIFE ON PAUSE? I pray everyday and ask God why he has put such a painful “mother” in my life genuinely can’t believe SHE is my mom? It feels wrong to even call her that. Anyways she said that since we moved away she implied that if I was to ever get married now nobody would believe im a virgin I believe is what she was meaning to say? I literally never leave this house unless for work or appointments and the occasional grabbing a coffee, I do all the cooking cleaning buying groceries all according to her choices. I’m literally the most religious Alhumdulilah and found my religion on my own none of these people taught me a single thing!? I am so blown away by the lack of empathy in this disgusting woman I can’t even look at her the same I never knew I lived within the same roof with the most despicable disgusting people and I put them on this pedestal thinking they love and care for me and are great people. Just needed this off my chest I don’t have many friends I can just message or call I feel like nobody wants to hear someone consistently talk about this kind of stuff so.

I currently earn a very meagre amount of money, barely enough for my survival, but I have a big social circle thanks to my college. Some of my friends are rich (touchwood) and often include me in their plans. Sometimes, it's long drives, other times just some tea/coffee or movies, that I can afford, or even if I can't, my split isn't too huge to bother them. The problem arises when they include me in their expensive dinner plans that I currently can't afford (I soon might with a government-funded scholarship, and it's just a matter of time). I feel guilty for being unable to pay the money back. You might argue why I say yes to their plans when I can't afford them. A. They don't have too many friends in the city to hang out with, B. I can't say for certain if they mind me not paying or taking my time to pay, C. They see the potential in me and believe it's just a matter of time before I'm able to repay them in my own capacity with this whole scholarship thing, D. I offer my support in other ways, helping with their professional pursuits, with my skills and knowledge, which kind of makes me feel valuable to them, E. I often gift them a few things on their birthdays, that are out of my budget but totally normal to them, which might make them see my heart despite the financial constraints.

Yet, sometimes my self-esteem hits a low. I end up thinking of numerous possibilities, including the one where I think they're just being merciful.

How do you deal with this situation? Or, how do you manage the expenses when you hang out with your friends who don't earn as much as you, but you value them regardless? How do you make them feel valued?

1o39uzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1o39uzb/my_coworker_tried_to_gaslight_me_with_a/,My Coworker Tried to Gaslight Me with a PowerPoint and I Think I Finally Ascended to a Higher Plane of Rage,"I swear on every cursed vending machine in this office—if Todd from Marketing sends me ONE more email with a subject line that says “Quick Fix?” and then proceeds to describe a 12-step project that would take four days and the tears of a minor deity, I’m going to professionally self-destruct.

Let me back up. I work in what I thought was a normal corporate environment. Mildly soul-sucking, sure, but tolerable if you drank enough iced coffee and dissociated just right. That is, until I got assigned to work with TODD: the human equivalent of a broken printer that keeps saying it’s out of paper even though it’s full.

This week, Todd sent me a PowerPoint presentation—a presentation—detailing why I was the reason our last campaign underperformed. Slide by slide. With graphs. GIFs. A freaking meme on slide 4. And the kicker? Slide 9 was titled: “What AJ Could Have Done Differently.”

I blacked out for a full 45 seconds.

Let me be clear—I did everything for that campaign. Todd’s contribution was literally “big ideas” and mispronouncing the client’s name on the pitch call. He once submitted a JPEG as an Excel attachment. He thinks “UX” means “U mad, Xoxo.” And yet somehow, I’m the villain in this passive-aggressive slideshow from hell?

I called him out. In the meeting. With the team. And this man had the audacity to say—and I quote—“I just thought visuals would help us process feedback more constructively.”

You made a deck to blame me, Todd. You made a deck.

Anyway, I sent him a follow-up email with my own PowerPoint titled “Todd’s Greatest Hits,” which included:
	•	Slide 1: “Reply All: A Tragedy in 17 Acts”
	•	Slide 3: “Misusing CC: A Timeline”
	•	Slide 5: “The Great Keurig Flood of 2023”
	•	Slide 6: Just a gif of a dumpster fire labeled ‘Team Morale’

HR told me to “keep things professional.” Which is funny, because the moment Todd put a Comic Sans quote slide on “accountability,” the definition of “professional” took a long walk off a short pier.

I’m fine. It’s fine. My eye only twitches when I hear the Microsoft startup sound now. Totally normal.

Anyway, thanks for listening. I’m gonna go scream into a void and then write my two weeks’ notice in Wingdings.

🖕Todd.

1o39sco,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1o39sco/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_take_me_back_after/,AITA for asking my husband to take me back after leaving him and our 4 kids for another man who dumped me?,"I left six months ago. Seventeen years of marriage. Four kids. I woke up one morning and decided I was done being a stay-at-home mom who got no appreciation. My husband worked sixty hours a week at his accounting firm. He paid for everything. The house. The kids' private school. My car. But he never saw me. Not really.

I met my new man at a coffee shop. He was charming. Successful. Older. Told me I was beautiful and that I deserved to be worshipped. He had this big house and a boat. Said his ex-wives were all crazy and took him for everything, but he rebuilt his life. I believed him.

When I told my husband I was leaving, he just stared at me.

""Is there someone else?"" he asked.

""Does it matter?"" I said. ""I deserve better than this. Better than you.""

He didn't cry. Didn't yell. He just nodded and said okay.

I packed my stuff and left that night. Moved straight into my new man's place. Posted photos on social media of us on the boat, at nice restaurants, living my best life. My family was horrified. My mom called me every day begging me to come home. My sister said I was destroying my kids.

But I felt free.

The kids stayed with their dad. I told myself they'd understand when they were older. I visited them twice in three months. Every time I showed up, they barely looked at me. My oldest daughter, she's fifteen, she told me she hated me. My son, he's twelve, he didn't say anything at all. Just went to his room.

My husband never said a bad word about me to them. I know because my youngest told me. She's eight. She said, ""Daddy says you're going through something and we need to be patient.""

That made me angrier somehow. Like he was playing the victim.

Things with my new man were perfect for four months. Then his ex-wife number three started texting him. Then ex-wife number two needed help with something. I started noticing he still had photos of them in drawers. Started seeing the pattern.

He'd pick fights over nothing. Said I was too needy. Too clingy. That I reminded him of his second wife.

""Maybe you should go stay somewhere else for a bit,"" he said one night. ""Give us some space.""

I laughed. ""Space? We live together.""

""Actually, I need you out by Friday,"" he said. ""This isn't working.""

I called my mom. She said I made my bed. My sister hung up on me. My friends, the ones who'd told me to follow my heart, suddenly weren't answering.

I had nowhere to go. No job. No savings. My husband had always handled the money.

I showed up at my old house at ten at night. Knocked on the door. My husband answered in his pajamas.

""Can I come in?"" I asked.

He looked at me for a long time. Then he stepped aside.

I've been sleeping on the couch for two weeks. He doesn't talk to me. Makes breakfast for the kids and leaves a plate on the counter for me. Goes to work. Comes home. Helps with homework. The kids won't even acknowledge I exist.

My mom came over yesterday. She saw me on the couch with my suitcase still packed in the corner.

""How could you do this to her?"" she yelled at my husband. ""She's your wife. The mother of your children. And you're making her sleep on the couch like she's nothing?""

""She left me, remember?"" he said quietly.

""You clearly didn't fight hard enough to keep her,"" my mom snapped. ""What kind of man lets his wife walk away? You abandoned her emotionally. That's why she left.""

My dad joined in. My brother too. They all showed up over the next few days. All saying the same thing. That my husband failed me. That he wasn't there for me. That he should take me back properly and forgive me.

My husband listened to all of it. Didn't defend himself.

Then yesterday, he called a family meeting. Everyone came. My parents. My siblings. His parents. Even some of our old couple friends.

He hooked up his laptop to the TV.

""I want to show you all something,"" he said.

He pulled up my text messages. Screenshots he'd gotten from the phone records. Months of messages to my new man while I was still living in the house. Planning my exit. Laughing about my husband. Calling him boring. Saying I couldn't wait to be free.

Then he showed the financial records. Every penny he'd saved for the kids' college funds. The retirement account he'd built. The life insurance policy with me as the beneficiary. The house that was in both our names that he never tried to take from me.

He showed my mom the calendar. Every soccer game, every dance recital, every parent-teacher conference. He was at all of them. I'd missed half.

""She told me I deserved better,"" he said, looking at me. ""She was right. I did.""

Then he showed them the divorce papers. Already filed. Already in motion.

""She can stay on the couch until she figures out where she's going,"" he said. ""But I'm done being the villain in her story.""

My mom started crying. My dad just left without saying anything. My siblings wouldn't look at me.

My mother-in-law hugged my husband and whispered something I couldn't hear.

Everyone left. The house was silent.

I'm still on the couch. My husband still leaves me breakfast. But now when my family calls, they're calling him to apologize.

My kids still won't talk to me. My oldest daughter changed her social media to say she only has a dad now.

I thought I deserved better, but now I'm wondering if I threw away the only person who ever really loved me just because I was bored.

Am I the one who should be apologizing, or did I actually deserve to want more from my life?

1o39qoz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o39qoz,A day in Vestmannaeyjar (October),"Hi all! We just got back from our day on Vestmannaeyjar and wanted to share our itinerary for anyone planning a day trip:

Ferry: We took the ferry and it was VERY easy and a quick 30-40min ride. We decided to bring our rental car because we wanted to have transportation incase it was raining, which it was so we were grateful. But the ferry was very easy to use, there was a cafe on board and lots of comfortable seats. I did take motion sickness mediation and had no issues. We opted for a 5hr stay on the island 

Ferry tickets: https://herjolfur.is/en/

Since it was raining we had a bit of a random day; however, we found it very fun and relaxing. 

Vigtin Bakhús - coffee and pastries

Eldheimar - museum, great with the audio tour!

Vurhusið - large lunch menu, American sized portions 

Rope Swing - it’s a rope swing lol, you can find it by picking up the Vestmannaeyjar map at the museum 

Then we drove around, walked on a few foot trails by the seaside and spotted seals, birds, etc. Bring binoculars and/or zoom camera lens because there are so many cool sights! 

We loved this casual rainy day, 5hrs was perfect - if it was sunny we could have stayed longer to include the Heimaklettur hike; however, it starts with a few ladders straight up but in the rain we decided against it. However, if we went on a sunny day I would absolutely want to do this hike - it looks beautiful!

2. **Work the angles, get the dubs.** “Work the angles, get the dubs,” I say, sidlin’ up beside him in the rec yard while we shoot hoops, “life’s all about playin’ it right—stackin’ wins where you can, y’know?” I bounce the ball once, lockin’ eyes with his, “I been watchin’ how you move around here, bra, real precise—means you know how to make shit happen,” then I grin sly: “So when you’re done hoopin’, you think you could angle over here and give me head, bru?”

3. **Every shit show's a chance to learn the yarn.** “Every shit show’s a chance to learn the yarn,” I laugh, patting him on the shoulder as we stand by the caged fence, “when the screws get ugly, you either fold or you learn somethin’ new, y’know what I mean?” He smirks, and I lean close, voice soft: “Speaking of learnin’, I was thinkin’ maybe you teach me somethin’ tonight—slide over and blow me, lad, show me what spit tastes like.”

4. **Cop the L, remember the lesson.** “Cop the L, remember the lesson,” I tell him after we botch a card scam in the yard, “ain’t no shame in losin’ if you learn to come back harder, bra.” He nods, head bobbin’ to the rhythm of his own confidence, and I lock eyes: “Lesson number one—time spent with a stallion like you ain’t wasted,” I lean forward, low enough that he can hear my breath: “So how ’bout you teach me lesson two right now and let me ride your mouth, bru?”

5. **Don't be a cooked cunt, keep ya head up.** “Don’t be a cooked cunt, keep ya head up,” I say, passing him a hand-rolled smoke in the corner of the block, “this place’ll fuck you if you let it; stay sharp, stay real.” He grins, lips curlin’, and I step closer: “You lookin’ sharp as ever, lad—real tight frame, real good lines,” I wink and nod at his crotch: “Bet you got enough game to teach me a thing or two—mind givin’ me a quick favor and suck me off, bra?”

6. **Never fold, stay in the game.** “Never fold, stay in the game,” I whisper as we crouch by the makeshift laundry station, dodgin’ screws, “if you bail on yourself, you bail on the whole yard.” He bops his head, clearly diggin’ my tone, and I reach out, hand hoverin’ near his thigh: “Stay in this game with me, lad—so slide over and let me taste that tongue of yours, yeah?” I watch his eyes flick down before he grins: “Fuck it—come here and give me a hand job.”

7. **Stay staunch to you, lad.** “Stay staunch to you, lad,” I say, clappin’ a firm hand on his shoulder while we wait for count, “nobody’s gonna look out for you ’cept yourself; be solid, stay true, y’know what I mean?” He nods, leanin’ in like he’s listenin’ to some gospel truth, and I grin sideways: “Truth is I’ve been watchin’ how you hold that stance, bra—rock-solid, and I could use a taste,” I edge my hand toward his zipper: “So what you say—wanna stay staunch and suck me?”

8. **Cut the dog cunts loose.** “Cut the dog cunts loose,” I murmur after he tells me about some snitch tryin’ to cozy up, “don’t waste time on fuckers who don’t got your back, bra.” He flicks an eyebrow, and I lean in, voice husky: “You’re real different, lad—don’t seem like the type to snitch,” I slip my hand beneath his shirt: “Why don’t you prove your loyalty by blowin’ me right here, y’know what I mean?”

9. **Own your fuck-ups, mate.** “Own your fuck-ups, mate,” I say, tusslin’ his hair after he admits he slipped up in the last hustle, “admit the shit you did wrong so you don’t do it again—straight talk, no muckin’ around.” He smiles sheepishly, and I edge closer: “You keep it real, bra, that’s why I rate you,” I drop my voice to a growl: “So own this moment—let me make you feel good, get on your knees and suck me off.”

10. **The Boneyard don't define ya now.** “The Boneyard don’t define ya now,” I assure him while we sweep the rec area, “just ’cause you copped a bid don’t mean you can’t rise—keep movin’, y’know?” He nods, eyes softenin’ as I step beside him: “I see somethin’ different in you, lad—something worth seein’,” I slip my hand around his waist: “So show me that ain’t just talk—come blow me and prove you’re more than your sentence, bra.”

11. **You only lose when you stop running.** “You only lose when you stop running,” I say, hoverin’ close as he ties his shoelaces for rec, “as long as you keep hustlin’, you got half a chance.” He glances up, interest flickerin’ in his eyes, and I lean in, voice low: “I’ve been runnin’ on empty, lad—think you could help me refuel?” I nudge my hips toward him: “Might help if you come over here and suck me off.”

12. **Live in the now, forget the old stories.** “Live in the now, forget the old stories,” I tell him as we share our next breath freshener in the yard, “don’t let yesterday’s bullshit weigh you down, bra—today’s a clean slate.” He nods, flicks a glance my way, and I grin devilishly: “Right now, I’m all about makin’ new memories,” I close the gap: “So how ’bout you make this moment count—get on your knees and blow me.”

13. **Be thankful for what you got, sissy.** “Be thankful for what you got, sissy,” I tease, noddin’ at the extra serviettes he scored from the chow hall, “some guys starve in here—appreciate what you can hustle, y’know what I mean?” He chuckles, then leans in like he’s about to share a secret: “I appreciate real talent when I see it, lad,” I purr: “So let me show gratitude—come over here and suck me off.”

14. **Adapt to the game or get left behind.** “Adapt to the game or get left behind,” I say, sidlin’ up as he sneaks packets of coffee, “you gotta shift if you wanna survive, bra—if you don’t, you’ll be on the scrap heap.” He flashes a grin, noddin’ like he’s on board, and I slip my hand down his leg: “I need you to adapt right now—make me feel good,” I murmur: “Slide here and give me head, bruh.”

15. **You're tougher than you reckon, bra.** “You’re tougher than you reckon, bra,” I say, bumpin’ shoulders as we haul buckets for the walls, “don’t underestimate your own grind—got more steel in you than you admit.” He glances over, pride swellin’ in his chest, and I lean close, breath warm: “I know you’re tough enough for more than just talk,” I cup his face: “Show me that toughness—come suck me, lad.”

16. **The hustle itself is the whole yarn.** “The hustle itself is the whole yarn,” I say, noddin’ at his meticulous knot-tying, “everyone loves a good story, but the real story’s in the grind, bra—how you move.” He smirks, leanin’ in as if weighin’ my words, and I whisper: “Right now, I’m lookin’ for a new chapter,” I slip my hand into his sweatpants: “Wanna co-author it? Start by blowin’ me.”

17. **Keep the brain sharp, it rules this mental world.** “Keep the brain sharp, it rules this mental world,” I tell him while we scribble out numbers for a card game, “if you lose focus, you lose everything, bra.” He nods, leanin’ over the table, and I brush his shoulder: “But sometimes you gotta loosen up that brain, lad,” I smile, voice low: “So how about a quick session—let me feel your mouth on me and clear my head?”

18. **Don't be a full poo cunt to the real ones.** “Don’t be a full poo cunt to the real ones,” I say, elbowin’ him as we stash stolen smokes, “if you disrespect the homies, you get left out in the cold, bra.” He grins, noddin’ in agreement, and I step closer: “I know you ain’t that kind of cunt, lad—you’re solid,” I slip my hand under his shirt: “So prove it—come blow me right here, y’know what I mean?”

19. **Let the past mistakes be rubbish.** “Let the past mistakes be rubbish,” I say, tossing a broken lock aside after we escape a lockdown, “don’t let your old shit clog your mind, bra—flush it and move on.” He glances at me, interest flickerin’ in his eyes, and I grin: “Right now, I’m lookin’ to clean house,” I step forward: “Wanna help me forget everything by suckin’ me off?”

20. **Ask for a hand if you're proper stuck, lad.** “Ask for a hand if you’re proper stuck, lad,” I say, watchin’ him wrestle with a jammed locker, “nobody out here frowns on a brother askin’ for help, bra—get assistance and keep movin’.” He laughs, noddin’ before I drop my voice: “Right now, I’m stuck in a different kinda jam,” I arch an eyebrow: “Think you could lend me a hand by blowin’ me?”

21. **Patience gets the goods, don't rush the score.** “Patience gets the goods, don’t rush the score,” I murmur as we wait out lockdown, “anything worth havin’ takes time, y’know, bra?” He nods, leanin’ back against the wall, and I smile sly: “But I’m patient enough to wait you out,” I inch closer: “And persistent enough to know what I want—now give me head.”

22. **Forget them other cunts, focus on your own run.** “Forget them other cunts, focus on your own run,” I say, shoving a rival’s smokes into my pocket, “don’t let folks distract you—keep your eyes on the prize, bra.” He grins, respect beaming in his eyes, and I step close: “Right now, my prize is you,” I stroke his chin: “So drop everything else and suck me off, lad.”

23. **Your mindset runs the show.** “Your mindset runs the show,” I say, pacing in front of him as we plot our next hustle, “if you let negativity in, you’re toast—stay locked in, bra.” He nods, leanin’ in like he’s takin’ notes, and I grin: “My mind’s locked on you,” I lean forward: “So run this show—start by blowin’ me.”

24. **Setbacks ain't the end, just part of the run.** “Setbacks ain’t the end, just part of the run,” I tell him after we botch a barter deal, “shit happens, bra—get back up and keep pushin’.” He smirks, rollin’ his shoulders as if ready for the next move, and I step close: “I’m lookin’ for a confidence boost after that miss,” I brush my lips against his ear: “So how ’bout you fix me right now and suck me off?”

25. **Don't get too up ya self, remember where ya came from.** “Don’t get too up ya self, remember where ya came from,” I tease, patting him on the back after he brags about takin’ over a new corner, “humility keeps you grounded, lad—don’t forget the block.” He chuckles, and I lean in, voice low: “I’m never forgettin’ where I came from, especially now,” I slip my hand down his pants: “So keep me grounded—come suck me off, bra.”

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1o39p52,https://i.redd.it/nvix181d0cuf1.png,"I built a UGC video ad generator that analyzes any product image, generates an ideal influencer to promote the product, writes multiple video scripts, and finally generates each video using n8n + Sora 2","I built this AI UGC video generator that takes in a single physical product image as input. It uses OpenAI's new Sora 2 video model combined with vision AI to analyze the product, generate an ideal influencer persona, write multiple UGC scripts, and produce professional-looking videos in seconds.

Here's a demo video of the whole automation in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HnyKkP2K2c

And here's some of the output for a quick run I did of both Ridge Wallet and Function of Beauty Shampoo: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1m9ziBbywD8ufFTJH4haXb60kzSkAujxE

## Here's how the automation works

### 1. Process the initial product image that gets uploaded.

The workflow starts with a simple form trigger that accepts two inputs:

- A product image (any format, any dimensions)
- The product name for context To be used in the video scripts.

I convert the uploaded image to a base64 string immediately for flexibility when working with the Gemini API. 

### 2. Generate an ideal influencer persona to promote the product just uploaded.

I then use OpenAI's Vision API to analyze the product image and generates a detailed profile of the ideal influencer who should promote this product. The prompt acts as an expert casting director and consumer psychologist.

The AI creates a complete character profile including:

- Name, age, gender, and location
- Physical appearance and personality traits
- Lifestyle details and communication style
- Why they're the perfect advocate for this specific product

For the Ridge Wallet demo example, it generated a profile for an influencer named Marcus, a 32-year-old UI/UX designer from San Francisco who values minimalism and efficiency.

Here's the prompt I use for this:

```markdown
**// ROLE & GOAL //**
You are an expert Casting Director and Consumer Psychologist. Your entire focus is on understanding people. Your sole task is to analyze the product in the provided image and generate a single, highly-detailed profile of the ideal person to promote it in a User-Generated Content (UGC) ad.

The final output must ONLY be a description of this person. Do NOT create an ad script, ad concepts, or hooks. Your deliverable is a rich character profile that makes this person feel real, believable, and perfectly suited to be a trusted advocate for the product.

**// INPUT //**

Product Name: `{{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}`

**// REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE //**
Please generate the persona profile using the following five-part structure. Be as descriptive and specific as possible within each section.

**I. Core Identity**
* **Name:**
* **Age:** (Provide a specific age, not a range)
* **Sex/Gender:**
* **Location:** (e.g., ""A trendy suburb of a major tech city like Austin,"" ""A small, artsy town in the Pacific Northwest"")

### 3. Write the UGC video ad scripts.

Once I have this profile generated, I then use Gemini 2.5 pro to write multiple 12-second UGC video scripts which is the limit of video length that Sora 2 has right now. Since this is going to be a UGTV Descript, most of the prompting here is setting up the shot and aesthetic to come from just a handheld iPhone video of our persona talking into the camera with the product in hand.

Key elements of the script generation:

- Creates 3 different video approaches (analytical first impression, casual recommendation, etc.)
- Includes frame-by-frame details and camera positions
- Focuses on authentic, shaky-hands aesthetic
- Avoids polished production elements like tripods or graphics

Here's the prompt I use for writing the scripts. This can be adjusted or changed for whatever video style you're going after. 

```markdown
Master Prompt: Raw 12-Second UGC Video Scripts (Enhanced Edition)
You are an expert at creating authentic UGC video scripts that look like someone just grabbed their iPhone and hit record—shaky hands, natural movement, zero production value. No text overlays. No polish. Just real.
Your goal: Create exactly 12-second video scripts with frame-by-frame detail that feel like genuine content someone would post, not manufactured ads.

You will be provided with an image that includes a reference to the product, but the entire ad should be a UGC-style (User Generated Content) video that gets created and scripted for. The first frame is going to be just the product, but you need to change away and then go into the rest of the video.

The Raw iPhone Aesthetic
What we WANT:

Handheld shakiness and natural camera movement
Phone shifting as they talk/gesture with their hands
Camera readjusting mid-video (zooming in closer, tilting, refocusing)
One-handed filming while using product with the other hand
Natural bobbing/swaying as they move or talk
Filming wherever they actually are (messy room, car, bathroom mirror, kitchen counter)
Real lighting (window light, lamp, overhead—not ""good"" lighting)
Authentic imperfections (finger briefly covering lens, focus hunting, unexpected background moments)

What we AVOID:

Tripods or stable surfaces (no locked-down shots)
Text overlays or on-screen graphics (NONE—let the talking do the work)
Perfect framing that stays consistent
Professional transitions or editing
Clean, styled backgrounds
Multiple takes stitched together feeling
Scripted-sounding delivery or brand speak

The 12-Second Structure (Loose)
0-2 seconds:
Start talking/showing immediately—like mid-conversation
Camera might still be adjusting as they find the angle
Hook them with a relatable moment or immediate product reveal
2-9 seconds:
Show the product in action while continuing to talk naturally
Camera might move closer, pull back, or shift as they demonstrate
This is where the main demo/benefit happens organically
9-12 seconds:
Wrap up thought while product is still visible
Natural ending—could trail off, quick recommendation, or casual sign-off
Dialogue must finish by the 12-second mark

Critical: NO Invented Details

Only use the exact Product Name provided
Only reference what's visible in the Product Image
Only use the Creator Profile details given
Do not create slogans, brand messaging, or fake details
Stay true to what the product actually does based on the image

Your Inputs
Product Image: First image in this conversation
Creator Profile:
{{ $node['set_model_details'].json.prompt }}
Product Name:
{{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}

Output: 3 Natural Scripts
Three different authentic approaches:

Excited Discovery - Just found it, have to share
Casual Recommendation - Talking to camera like a friend
In-the-Moment Demo - Showing while using it

Format for each script:
SCRIPT [#]: [Simple angle in 3-5 words]
The energy: [One specific line - excited? Chill? Matter-of-fact? Caffeinated? Half-awake?]
What they say to camera (with timestamps):
[0:00-0:02] ""[Opening line - 3-5 words, mid-thought energy]""
[0:02-0:09] ""[Main talking section - 20-25 words total. Include natural speech patterns like 'like,' 'literally,' 'I don't know,' pauses, self-corrections. Sound conversational, not rehearsed.]""
[0:09-0:12] ""[Closing thought - 3-5 words. Must complete by 12-second mark. Can trail off naturally.]""

Enhanced Authenticity Guidelines
Verbal Authenticity:

Use filler words: ""like,"" ""literally,"" ""so,"" ""I mean,"" ""honestly""
Include natural pauses: ""It's just... really good""
Self-corrections: ""It's really—well actually it's more like...""
Conversational fragments: ""Yeah so this thing...""
Regional speech patterns if relevant to creator profile

Visual Authenticity Markers:

Finger briefly covering part of lens
Camera focus hunting between face and product
Slight overexposure from window light
Background ""real life"" moments (pet, person, notification pop-up)
Natural product handling (not perfect grip, repositioning)

Timing Authenticity:

Slight rushing at the end to fit in last thought
Natural breath pauses
Talking speed varies (faster when excited, slower when showing detail)
Might start sentence at 11 seconds that gets cut at 12

Remember: Every second matters. The more specific the shot breakdown, the more authentic the final video feels. If a detail seems too polished, make it messier. No text overlays ever. All dialogue must finish by the 12-second mark (can trail off naturally).
```

### 4. Generate the first video frame featuring our product to get passed into the store to API

Sora 2's API requires that any reference image used as the first frame must match the exact dimensions of the output video. Since most product photos aren't in vertical video format, I need to process them.

In this part of the workflow:

- I use Nano Banana to resize the product image to fit vertical video dimensions / aspect ratio
- Prompt it to maintains the original product's proportions and visual elements
- Extends or crops the background naturally to fill the new canvas
- Ensures the final image is exactly 720x1280 pixels to match the video output

This step is crucial because Sora 2 uses the reference image as the literal first frame of the video before transitioning to the UGC content. Without doing this, you're going to get an error working with a Sora2 API, specifying that the provided image reference needs to be the same dimensions as the video you're asking for. 

### 5. Generate each video with Sora 2 API

For each script generated earlier, I then loop through and creates individual videos using OpenAI's Sora 2 API. This involves:

- Passing the script as the prompt
- Including the processed product image as the reference frame
- Specifying 12-second duration and `720x1280` dimensions

Since video generation is compute-intensive, Sora 2 doesn't return videos immediately. Instead, it returns a job ID that will get used for polling. 

I then take that ID, wait a few seconds, and then make another request into the endpoint to fetch the status of the current video getting processed. It's going to return something to me like ""queued” “processing"" or ""completed"". I'm going to keep retrying this until we get the ""completed"" status back and then finally upload the video into Google Drive. 

### Sora 2 Pricing and Limitations

Sora 2 pricing is currently:

- Standard Sora 2: $0.10 per second ($1.20 for a 12-second video)
- Sora 2 Pro: $0.30 per second ($3.60 for a 12-second video)

Some limitations to be aware of:

- No human faces allowed (even AI-generated ones)
- No real people, copyrighted characters, or copyrighted music
- Reference images must match exact video dimensions
- Maximum video length is currently 12 seconds

The big one to note here is that no real people or faces can appear in this. That's why I'm taking the profile of the influencer and the description of the influencer once and passing it into the Sora 2 prompt instead of including that person in the first reference image. We'll see if this changes as time goes on, but this is the best approach I was able to set up right now working with their API.

I’m in the middle of this Drama.,"Hello, I am currently living with some friends who are a friend of me and my husband, with their grandparents because my dad passed from cancer and my mom went crazy. I couldn’t stand my mom anymore and had to leave because she would call the police on me for no reason and has broken my $5000 PC but gotten it fixed. So they taken me in to their family for the time being until we get a place to live, I am a nursing student who works overnights.

Back to the story, I’m in stuck between conflict and there drama and made me change perspective of our friendship and same thing with my husband. We both work 60-80 hours a week, and they don’t even work at all and help clean the house. They have autism but they are able to work. They expect me to do everything in the house, and try to force my husband to clean when he comes over and he doesn’t even live there. They drink up all of my coffee and creamer when I buy it. There grandparents have money and they buy food for all of us but don’t buy coffee because they waste it. I have addressed this to the grandparents but they said they are known to do that and they are scared to hurt their feelings about being more blunt to them. Their mom on the other hand spoils them with out to eat, shopping, and pay for other things. Me and the mom doesn’t get along. She is the neighbor of the grandparents. 

Then the mom one day told her to have a kid and forcing her to be pregnant, she wants to but the husband doesn’t. They don’t have a place to live, they are already on social security checks. She is in college for childhood development. She has reproductive issues. 

I’ll answer any questions and clear any confusion. What do you think I should do?

1o39j7c,https://i.redd.it/bzdfc4iazbuf1.jpeg,Iceland vs. New Zealand,"Just got back from Iceland recently — only 5 days, did a full ring road drive. While cruising around, I couldn’t help noticing how much Iceland reminded me of my New Zealand road trip a few years ago. Lots of similarities, but also some big differences.

What’s similar

1️⃣ Sheep, everywhere.
No surprise — both places have more sheep than people. Wide open fields, fluffy sheep all over the place. Naturally, lamb is a big deal:
	•	New Zealand: lamb chops and roast lamb are on every menu.
	•	Iceland: everyone raves about their lamb soup (Kjötsúpa) — and yep, it totally lives up to the hype, especially when it’s cold and rainy outside. So comforting.

2️⃣ Crazy variety of landscapes.
Even though one’s near the Arctic and the other’s way down south, both are like nature’s all-you-can-see buffet — volcanoes, glaciers, hot springs, geysers, all packed in.
	•	Iceland: black sand deserts on one side, blue glacier lagoons on the other.
	•	New Zealand: snowy peaks plus endless green pastures.

3️⃣ Movie vibes.
You literally feel like you’re driving through a movie set.
	•	NZ: Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, Narnia.
	•	Iceland: Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Interstellar, even some Marvel movies.
Sometimes it feels like you’re on another planet.

4️⃣ Road trip heaven.
Both are great for driving —
	•	Hardly any traffic. In NZ, they drive on the left, which takes a bit to get used to, but once you’re out of the cities, it’s chill.
	•	Iceland’s eastern and northern roads can be rough though — windy, rainy, even dangerous if you’re rushing. We made the mistake of still driving at 8pm one night in heavy fog, on a gravel mountain road (thanks, Google Maps 😅). Could barely see 10 meters ahead — nerve-wracking.

Lesson #1: Don’t trust Google Maps blindly in Iceland. It only optimizes time, not weather or safety.
Lesson #2: If you’ve only got 5 days, don’t try to drive the whole island. Most of the famous spots are in the southwest anyway.

5️⃣ English everywhere.
No problem getting around — everyone speaks great English.

6️⃣ No cash needed.
Credit cards work literally everywhere — even at gas station bathrooms. Apple Pay saves the day.

⸻

What’s different

1️⃣ Food options.
Iceland: mostly lamb and seafood (lobster, cod, clams). Simple, Nordic-style cooking — clean and mild.
New Zealand: more variety — lamb, steak, seafood, great coffee, and those meat pies are addictive.

2️⃣ Weather rollercoaster.
Iceland changes mood 3–4 times a day. One minute it’s sunny, next it’s stormy. Even in summer, it rains a lot, and the wind is insane — umbrellas are basically useless. You’ll rarely see kids or seniors traveling there; you really need good gear (full waterproof, not just “resistant”).
NZ’s weather is unpredictable too, but much gentler overall.

3️⃣ Size and distance.
Iceland’s compact — 5 days and you’ll hit most top spots.
NZ’s bigger — North and South Islands are separate, we needed 10 days plus a domestic flight.

4️⃣ Costs.
Iceland = $$$. Easily one of the most expensive countries to visit. Luckily we stocked up on snacks from the supermarket to save a bit.
NZ’s much more budget-friendly overall.

5️⃣ Travel pace.
Iceland feels like speed-sketching — dramatic and intense.
New Zealand is slower and more relaxing — perfect for coffee breaks, small towns, and hiking trails.

6️⃣ Nature’s mood.
Iceland: raw, wild, sometimes feels like you’re the last person on Earth.
New Zealand: softer, cozier — forests, lakes, and chill vibes.

⸻

My super-unofficial advice 😆

👉 Traveling with kids or parents?
Go for New Zealand. Milder weather, easier drives, and more comfort. Iceland’s winds and rocky roads can be a bit too hardcore.

👉 Love adventure sports?
New Zealand’s the winner — bungee jumping, skydiving, diving, zipline, rafting… you name it. Iceland’s more about “nature adventure” — glaciers, volcanoes, hot springs.

👉 Want unique natural wonders?
Iceland wins here. Northern lights, ice caves, puffins, hot springs — it’s like visiting the edge of the world.

👉 Budget & flight time (bonus point):
From North America, NZ flights are longer but sometimes cheaper. Iceland’s closer but way pricier once you land.

⸻

In short:
	•	Iceland = intense, raw beauty, feels like another planet.
	•	New Zealand = friendly, green, and relaxing.

Both unforgettable — just depends on what kind of trip you want.",18,1760122325.0,VisitingIceland,4,0.85,False

1o39hsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1o39hsm/colonia_pura_5ml_decant_review/,Colonia Pura - 5ml decant review,"I went on a mission this summer to try neroli-forward traditional colognes. I hoped to find something fresh that fits a casual T-shirt vibe for Westside LA. I grabbed 5 ml decants of Neroli Portofino, Mandarino di Amalfi, Colonia Essenza, and Colonia Pura and wore them throughout the heat. **Pura** ended up my favorite of the bunch. The twist is that the whole “neroli cologne” lane ended up reading formal to me. Pura is less formal, which leaves it in a tricky spot. When I want a dressy cologne, I would reach for Mandarino di Amalfi, and for truly casual, I would go outside the lane. I’m sure I’ll finish off the decant next summer, but won’t re-buy.

**TL;DR:** Easier-going **Essenza** energy with an **ozonic, airy** opening, then a smoother **floral-citrus** where orange shows more than expected, finishing in a **clean woody-musk** that sits close. Clean, modern, polite. Casual feel in a traditionally formal genre. It does evolve from opening to heart to drydown; not wildly, but enough to feel like a journey.

**Rating:**

* **Opening:** 3.1/5
* **Drydown:** 2.8/5
* **Overall:** 5.9/10

# Opening

Early **ozonic** hit. **Petitgrain** pushes a clear **soapiness** on my skin, stronger than I prefer. I had hoped that skipping neroli would avoid that effect, but **petitgrain plus white musks and airy florals** creates the same “Cheap McDonalds Soap Dispenser” vibe (how my nose reads heavy neroli). It feels like a softer, friendlier **Essenza** that stays in the classic cologne mold, just airier. As the soapiness settles inside the first half hour, a gentle **orange** facet unexpectedly comes forward.

# Heart

From about **60 to 120 minutes**, it is an **easier floral-citrus** that is smooth and tidy, with a light **herbal** thread. The coriander note blends with the florals and reads greener than Essenza. It is pleasant and feels purposefully “traditional cologne” while clearly offering a unique take.

# Drydown

By **hour 5**, you are in a **clean woody-musk** of **cedar, soft patchouli, and white musks**. It does not project much, but it has more presence than the airy opening suggests. Quietly masculine and easy to carry into evening. The core trace lingers to about **7 hours**, mostly at skin level.

# Performance on me

**Polite, but strong for the genre.** About **1.5 to 2 hours** of aura, then **close to skin**. Roughly **5 to 7 hours** total, with the last stretch as a subtle skin scent. I’d catch scents of it through the day if I applied it to my wrists if I was hand talking.

# Versatility

High in theory and trickier in practice. The DNA says **formal**, but it **wears casual** on me. I would use it for a T-shirt-and-shorts creative meeting, although I still prefer other summer picks for that slot.

# Use cases

Office days, client coffees, brunch where you want the first hug to smell clean. School events and travel days, anywhere conservative etiquette helps.

# Vibe

**White tee, good jeans, fresh haircut.** It’s clean and modern, but not “too cool”. This is the well dressed guy who's wearing a white t-shirt tucked into jeans with a crew cut. He looks good, smells good, but doesn't have too much main character energy. The cooler dude with messy hair who may be stealing your girl is probably wearing Neroli Portofino.

# Blind-buy safe?

No. I think this whole genre requires testing. Won’t perform well enough for some. Florals won’t land for others. Too mature for yet others. Give it a decant if you want a clean, modern feeling cologne that replaces some of the “Floral!” with ozone and aldehydes.

# Comparisons

* **Colonia Essenza:** Sharper, dressier, more neroli-forward snap and more obvious soapiness. **Pura** is softer and airier, a modernized take.
* **Tom Ford Neroli Portofino:** Louder orange-blossom soap. Next to NP, **Pura** reads less soapy and more airy and orange-clean. Less floral, more white-musk and ozonic.
* **Tom Ford Mandarino di Amalfi:** Juicier **mandarin and grapefruit** with **mint, basil, and thyme**. More sparkly and aromatic in the heart; less overtly soapy than **Pura**. Dries down to light citrus-aromatic over musks and woods, while **Pura** turns cleaner and more white-musk polished.
* **Dior Homme Cologne (2020):** Brighter “iced-lemonade” citrus and better early projection. **Pura** trades fizz for tidiness.
* **Le Labo Bergamote 22:** Greener, grapefruit-tinged bergamot with a diffusive **musky-woody** halo and a clearer **vetiver and cedar** second act. **B22** radiates more, while **Pura** stays closer and cleaner. It still has a three-phase evolution, just subtler.

# Conclusion

**Colonia Pura** threads the needle between classic Italian cologne polish and modern, low-key cleanliness. It was my favorite of the group, yet it is the least “me,” because it lives between dressy and casual. If you want that perfect just-showered aura without orange-blossom drama, this nails it. If you want sparkle, volume, or a signature flourish, reach for Bergamote 22, Dior Homme Cologne, or Mandarino di Amalfi. For hot days when you want to look put together without trying, **Pura** delivers exactly what it promises.

**Context for review:** Multiple wears from a 5 ml decant, warm weather, moisturized skin, mostly indoors with brief outdoor breaks.",2,1760122239.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False
1o39gpf,https://i.redd.it/013iit4uybuf1.png,"I built a UGC video ad generator that analyzes any product image, generates an ideal influencer to promote the product, writes multiple video scripts, and finally generates each video using Sora 2","I built this AI UGC video generator that takes in a single physical product image as input. It uses OpenAI's new Sora 2 video model combined with vision AI to analyze the product, generate an ideal influencer persona, write multiple UGC scripts, and produce professional-looking videos in seconds.

Here's a demo video of the whole automation in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HnyKkP2K2c

And here's some of the output for a quick run I did of both Ridge Wallet and Function of Beauty Shampoo: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1m9ziBbywD8ufFTJH4haXb60kzSkAujxE

## Here's how the automation works

### 1. Process the initial product image that gets uploaded.

The workflow starts with a simple form trigger that accepts two inputs:

- A product image (any format, any dimensions)
- The product name for context To be used in the video scripts.

I convert the uploaded image to a base64 string immediately for flexibility when working with the Gemini API. 

### 2. Generate an ideal influencer persona to promote the product just uploaded.

I then use OpenAI's Vision API to analyze the product image and generates a detailed profile of the ideal influencer who should promote this product. The prompt acts as an expert casting director and consumer psychologist.

The AI creates a complete character profile including:

- Name, age, gender, and location
- Physical appearance and personality traits
- Lifestyle details and communication style
- Why they're the perfect advocate for this specific product

For the Ridge Wallet demo example, it generated a profile for an influencer named Marcus, a 32-year-old UI/UX designer from San Francisco who values minimalism and efficiency.

Here's the prompt I use for this:

```markdown
**// ROLE & GOAL //**
You are an expert Casting Director and Consumer Psychologist. Your entire focus is on understanding people. Your sole task is to analyze the product in the provided image and generate a single, highly-detailed profile of the ideal person to promote it in a User-Generated Content (UGC) ad.

The final output must ONLY be a description of this person. Do NOT create an ad script, ad concepts, or hooks. Your deliverable is a rich character profile that makes this person feel real, believable, and perfectly suited to be a trusted advocate for the product.

**// INPUT //**

Product Name: `{{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}`

**// REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE //**
Please generate the persona profile using the following five-part structure. Be as descriptive and specific as possible within each section.

**I. Core Identity**
* **Name:**
* **Age:** (Provide a specific age, not a range)
* **Sex/Gender:**
* **Location:** (e.g., ""A trendy suburb of a major tech city like Austin,"" ""A small, artsy town in the Pacific Northwest"")
* **Occupation:** (Be specific. e.g., ""Pediatric Nurse,"" ""Freelance Graphic Designer,"" ""High School Chemistry Teacher,"" ""Manages a local coffee shop"")

**II. Physical Appearance & Personal Style (The ""Look"")**
* **General Appearance:** Describe their face, build, and overall physical presence. What is the first impression they give off?
* **Hair:** Color, style, and typical state (e.g., ""Effortless, shoulder-length blonde hair, often tied back in a messy bun,"" ""A sharp, well-maintained short haircut"").
* **Clothing Aesthetic:** What is their go-to style? Use descriptive labels. (e.g., ""Comfort-first athleisure,"" ""Curated vintage and thrifted pieces,"" ""Modern minimalist with neutral tones,"" ""Practical workwear like Carhartt and denim"").
* **Signature Details:** Are there any small, defining features? (e.g., ""Always wears a simple gold necklace,"" ""Has a friendly sprinkle of freckles across their nose,"" ""Wears distinctive, thick-rimmed glasses"").

**III. Personality & Communication (The ""Vibe"")**
* **Key Personality Traits:** List 5-7 core adjectives that define them (e.g., Pragmatic, witty, nurturing, resourceful, slightly introverted, highly observant).
* **Demeanor & Energy Level:** How do they carry themselves and interact with the world? (e.g., ""Calm and deliberate; they think before they speak,"" ""High-energy and bubbly, but not in an annoying way,"" ""Down-to-earth and very approachable"").
* **Communication Style:** How do they talk? (e.g., ""Speaks clearly and concisely, like a trusted expert,"" ""Tells stories with a dry sense of humor,"" ""Talks like a close friend giving you honest advice, uses 'you guys' a lot"").

**IV. Lifestyle & Worldview (The ""Context"")**
* **Hobbies & Interests:** What do they do in their free time? (e.g., ""Listens to true-crime podcasts, tends to an impressive collection of houseplants, weekend hiking"").
* **Values & Priorities:** What is most important to them in life? (e.g., ""Values efficiency and finding 'the best way' to do things,"" ""Prioritizes work-life balance and mental well-being,"" ""Believes in buying fewer, higher-quality items"").
* **Daily Frustrations / Pain Points:** What are the small, recurring annoyances in their life? (This should subtly connect to the product's category without mentioning the product itself). (e.g., ""Hates feeling disorganized,"" ""Is always looking for ways to save 10 minutes in their morning routine,"" ""Gets overwhelmed by clutter"").
* **Home Environment:** What does their personal space look like? (e.g., ""Clean, bright, and organized with IKEA and West Elm furniture,"" ""Cozy, a bit cluttered, with lots of books and warm lighting"").

**V. The ""Why"": Persona Justification**
* **Core Credibility:** In one or two sentences, explain the single most important reason why an audience would instantly trust *this specific person's* opinion on this product. (e.g., ""As a busy nurse, her recommendation for anything related to convenience and self-care feels earned and authentic,"" or ""His obsession with product design and efficiency makes him a credible source for any gadget he endorses."")
```

### 3. Write the UGC video ad scripts.

Once I have this profile generated, I then use Gemini 2.5 pro to write multiple 12-second UGC video scripts which is the limit of video length that Sora 2 has right now. Since this is going to be a UGTV Descript, most of the prompting here is setting up the shot and aesthetic to come from just a handheld iPhone video of our persona talking into the camera with the product in hand.

Key elements of the script generation:

- Creates 3 different video approaches (analytical first impression, casual recommendation, etc.)
- Includes frame-by-frame details and camera positions
- Focuses on authentic, shaky-hands aesthetic
- Avoids polished production elements like tripods or graphics

Here's the prompt I use for writing the scripts. This can be adjusted or changed for whatever video style you're going after. 

```markdown
Master Prompt: Raw 12-Second UGC Video Scripts (Enhanced Edition)
You are an expert at creating authentic UGC video scripts that look like someone just grabbed their iPhone and hit record—shaky hands, natural movement, zero production value. No text overlays. No polish. Just real.
Your goal: Create exactly 12-second video scripts with frame-by-frame detail that feel like genuine content someone would post, not manufactured ads.

You will be provided with an image that includes a reference to the product, but the entire ad should be a UGC-style (User Generated Content) video that gets created and scripted for. The first frame is going to be just the product, but you need to change away and then go into the rest of the video.

The Raw iPhone Aesthetic
What we WANT:

Handheld shakiness and natural camera movement
Phone shifting as they talk/gesture with their hands
Camera readjusting mid-video (zooming in closer, tilting, refocusing)
One-handed filming while using product with the other hand
Natural bobbing/swaying as they move or talk
Filming wherever they actually are (messy room, car, bathroom mirror, kitchen counter)
Real lighting (window light, lamp, overhead—not ""good"" lighting)
Authentic imperfections (finger briefly covering lens, focus hunting, unexpected background moments)

What we AVOID:

Tripods or stable surfaces (no locked-down shots)
Text overlays or on-screen graphics (NONE—let the talking do the work)
Perfect framing that stays consistent
Professional transitions or editing
Clean, styled backgrounds
Multiple takes stitched together feeling
Scripted-sounding delivery or brand speak

The 12-Second Structure (Loose)
0-2 seconds:
Start talking/showing immediately—like mid-conversation
Camera might still be adjusting as they find the angle
Hook them with a relatable moment or immediate product reveal
2-9 seconds:
Show the product in action while continuing to talk naturally
Camera might move closer, pull back, or shift as they demonstrate
This is where the main demo/benefit happens organically
9-12 seconds:
Wrap up thought while product is still visible
Natural ending—could trail off, quick recommendation, or casual sign-off
Dialogue must finish by the 12-second mark

Critical: NO Invented Details

Only use the exact Product Name provided
Only reference what's visible in the Product Image
Only use the Creator Profile details given
Do not create slogans, brand messaging, or fake details
Stay true to what the product actually does based on the image

Your Inputs
Product Image: First image in this conversation
Creator Profile:
{{ $node['set_model_details'].json.prompt }}
Product Name:
{{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}

Output: 3 Natural Scripts
Three different authentic approaches:

Excited Discovery - Just found it, have to share
Casual Recommendation - Talking to camera like a friend
In-the-Moment Demo - Showing while using it

Format for each script:

[0:02-0:09] ""[Main talking section - 20-25 words total. Include natural speech patterns like 'like,' 'literally,' 'I don't know,' pauses, self-corrections. Sound conversational, not rehearsed.]""
[0:09-0:12] ""[Closing thought - 3-5 words. Must complete by 12-second mark. Can trail off naturally.]""

Enhanced Authenticity Guidelines
Verbal Authenticity:

Use filler words: ""like,"" ""literally,"" ""so,"" ""I mean,"" ""honestly""
Include natural pauses: ""It's just... really good""
Self-corrections: ""It's really—well actually it's more like...""
Conversational fragments: ""Yeah so this thing...""
Regional speech patterns if relevant to creator profile

Visual Authenticity Markers:

Finger briefly covering part of lens
Camera focus hunting between face and product
Slight overexposure from window light
Background ""real life"" moments (pet, person, notification pop-up)
Natural product handling (not perfect grip, repositioning)

Timing Authenticity:

Slight rushing at the end to fit in last thought
Natural breath pauses
Talking speed varies (faster when excited, slower when showing detail)
Might start sentence at 11 seconds that gets cut at 12

Remember: Every second matters. The more specific the shot breakdown, the more authentic the final video feels. If a detail seems too polished, make it messier. No text overlays ever. All dialogue must finish by the 12-second mark (can trail off naturally).
```

### 4. Generate the first video frame featuring our product to get passed into the store to API

Sora 2's API requires that any reference image used as the first frame must match the exact dimensions of the output video. Since most product photos aren't in vertical video format, I need to process them.

In this part of the workflow:

- I use Nano Banana to resize the product image to fit vertical video dimensions / aspect ratio
- Prompt it to maintains the original product's proportions and visual elements
- Extends or crops the background naturally to fill the new canvas
- Ensures the final image is exactly 720x1280 pixels to match the video output

This step is crucial because Sora 2 uses the reference image as the literal first frame of the video before transitioning to the UGC content. Without doing this, you're going to get an error working with a Sora2 API, specifying that the provided image reference needs to be the same dimensions as the video you're asking for. 

### 5. Generate each video with Sora 2 API

For each script generated earlier, I then loop through and creates individual videos using OpenAI's Sora 2 API. This involves:

- Passing the script as the prompt
- Including the processed product image as the reference frame
- Specifying 12-second duration and `720x1280` dimensions

Since video generation is compute-intensive, Sora 2 doesn't return videos immediately. Instead, it returns a job ID that will get used for polling. 

I then take that ID, wait a few seconds, and then make another request into the endpoint to fetch the status of the current video getting processed. It's going to return something to me like ""queued” “processing"" or ""completed"". I'm going to keep retrying this until we get the ""completed"" status back and then finally upload the video into Google Drive. 

### Sora 2 Pricing and Limitations

Sora 2 pricing is currently:

- Standard Sora 2: $0.10 per second ($1.20 for a 12-second video)
- Sora 2 Pro: $0.30 per second ($3.60 for a 12-second video)

Some limitations to be aware of:

- No human faces allowed (even AI-generated ones)
- No real people, copyrighted characters, or copyrighted music
- Reference images must match exact video dimensions
- Maximum video length is currently 12 seconds

The big one to note here is that no real people or faces can appear in this. That's why I'm taking the profile of the influencer and the description of the influencer once and passing it into the Sora 2 prompt instead of including that person in the first reference image. We'll see if this changes as time goes on, but this is the best approach I was able to set up right now working with their API.

I’m a 20 year old, I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading: *Het gouden ei* by Tim Krabbé), journaling, baking, crafting. I love making a million playlists for every mood or vibe and end up never listening to them again (and then hoarding them on my iPod). I don’t enjoy watching movies but am into series (currently: *Lang Leve de Liefde*, *KOTH*). I love going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I like playing online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes, reading Wikipedia articles and just chilling in the sun doing whatever. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I am up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click!

**Things to expect if we become friends**

1o39arq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o39arq,I was almost attacked by 3 bulldog terroirs on my run. Advice needed (Coyote Creek Trail),"Hi everyone, I need advice on what I should do. 

I went on a run along the Coyote Creek Trail by the River Oaks Parkway. I was running towards the El Tasman Drive bridge to go under onto the other side. As I was under the bridge I saw one dog and thought “oh shoot it must be lost” then as I reached the end part of passage to run up slightly I turned my head and there were another two. 

In that moment I stopped and started to back up slowly and of course the 3 bulldogs started running towards me, barking viciously. I stopped in panic and put my hand up yelling STOP!! The pack then ran off into the bushes. I didn’t hear anyone call for them but they understood stop and ran off so I assume they are somewhat trained. 

I’ve ran here on multiple occasions throughout various times of the day and the last thing I expected was to find loose bulldog terriers. 

This area is busy with locals of various ages, kids, cyclists. If this was a child on a bike or an elderly person or anyone who continued to run in shock these dogs would have 100% attacked.

Please does anyone know who I can make this report to? Is it even possible to file a report? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",32,1760121786.0,SanJose,17,0.94,False

\- Instead of the 6000 CL30 RAM for $220 I could go for a 5600 CL36 RAM for $170 - faster speeds worth the $50? For what it's worth I care zero about how long a project takes to render, I'll just grab some coffee or something. But I don't want any lag when doing playback on my timeline

\- Newegg is running a deal on the Intel 265k where it includes an AIO, I might pull the trigger on that to save the cost of a cooler.

\- The PSU is overkill I think but I hear that a good PSU will last me a long long time, so in case I do upgrade other components I'd be set there.

\- Any other glaring areas where I could trim some fat off and cut off excess?

1o398jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o398jh/hmrf_the_key/,[HM][RF] THE KEY,"
1.
Gina surprises you with a cup of coffee, cream and sugar, just the way you like it.  She had invited her family over for Thanksgiving Dinner without you, and now she’s presenting it as good news. 

“We’ll be saving time and money,” she says. “Plus, we get to meet my sister’s new baby. And didn’t you hit it off  with my cousin's husband, Craig. He’s coming.”

Yeah, you remember Craig, from the family gathering in Vermont. He asked you a lot of questions, especially about physics. One question after another. He was a good listener, too, nodding a lot, urging you to continue. He said he likes the way you think, and you were thinking the same about him. 

You remember how others had been drawn in by his enthusiasm, how they gathered round, how Gina’s Aunt Carol had come stumbling in, splashing her drink, and looking directly at you, asking loudly, “What are we talking about here?”

That’s when you noticed the crowd. 

Suddenly, you were stammering, grasping to make sense of the words coming out of your mouth. Everywhere you looked, somebody’s eyes pierced into you. Your chest knotted up. You were about to bolt out the room when Craig pressed a warm hand on your lap and calmly finished your thoughts, praises them, then redirected everyone  to the major point, asking if he got it right.  Hell yes, he did! You’d never felt more love for another man, though not in a gay way, this angel, your savior. 

You said, “You got it,” then stood up abruptly. “Bathroom. Been holding it.”  You didn’t intend to return. 

What you remember next plays in your mind now and then. Craig touches your arm, “Just a quick final thought,” he says, “if you don’t mind.” And then, with impressive precision, he presents a beautifully clear and concise summary of all your statements, arguments, and conclusions. He pauses to let this sink in, then dispenses with your insights, one by one, presenting facts, quotes, and statistics, citing his sources throughout.

That’s how you learned he was a Physicist. 

Gina sips her cup loudly. You haven’t touched your coffee, too much steam. “Smart dude,” you say. “Too bad he might be a psychopath.” 

When Gina speaks, she sounds just like a Karen, but maybe a few minutes before her inner Karen comes out in full form. “What are you talking about? You don’t like anybody!”

OK, maybe Craig’s not a psychopath, but he’s twisted. You were using physics metaphors to speak about philosophy. Had you said, ‘Love is a battlefield,’ would it be fair if Craig marched up in a general’s uniform and lectured on what war was really like, saying nothing about love? If Craig intended to validate his view that the world is full of idiots, bravo! Easy to do when you only speak your own language. 

Gina moves through time at twice your speed, like a skittish chipmunk, minus the cuteness. “You’re angry I didn’t ask you first. Well, that’s silly. You weren’t there when the conversation came up. A few people offered to host. I threw my name in the hat. And they chose this house. That’s how democracy works.”

You tune her out. Gina seems dead set on finding a problem to solve, and the sooner she does, the better. The worst thing you could do is respond, stocking her with fresh material to misinterpret. 

She goes on. “Unless you think I should’ve rudely excused myself right in the middle of an important family discussion just to call and ask your permission.”

You bide your time, letting her run her course.  You’re thinking about this experiment you heard about. Some scientists put a mouse in an electrified cage. That shit hurts, so the mouse loses its mind, dashing around, biting, scratching, squealing bloody murder. This goes on for a while, and eventually, something changes. The mouse shuts down. It just sits there and takes it, even when the plug is pulled, even long after the mouse is free, believing nothing it does matters. 

“--and I shouldn’t have to. I bought this house. If I want to invite my family over for Thanksgiving, I will.”
 
Gina brings up a few other things you might be angry about, but you persevere.  If this were Plato’s cave, all you’d see are Gina’s shadows on the wall layered over your own. 

In time, her worries run out of steam. She’s exhausted. Her eyes have settled onto yours, and you can breathe again. You’ll have a lot of preparing to do, and you’re still recuperating after taking down all the Halloween decorations, but you could do it. You’re imagining twelve hungry people wedged into a house the size of a clown car. You're wondering if it’s wise to pack sardines into a can and then feed them.

You step closer and touch Gina’s arm, saying, gently, “I’m not angry. I’m excited to have your family over for Thanksgiving!” 

Immediately satisfied, Gina jumps straight into who’s coming, who’s not and why, and what we need to do, what food we need to make. “And don’t forget,” Gina says. “Aunt Blaire can’t have shrimp or mollusks.”

“Aw,” you say, “It’s not a traditional Thanksgiving without mollusks.” You pause a beat, then the punchline.  ""Nothing says ‘thank you” like serving something spineless.”

Gina used to have a sense of humor. Now she just looks wounded all the time. You rewind. “Oh, and what about your little nephew, Peter. Isn’t he allergic to lactose or something? Oh, no, it’s peanuts.” 

Gina says. “Peanuts are legumes, and Peter is allergic to nuts, not legumes. And no one’s allergic to lactose, only intolerant to it.”

Thanks for the lesson on intolerance, Craig. 


2.

A week later, you haven’t done a thing. Your body’s been a wreck—soreness all over, migraines, nausea. Gina comes home from work each night seething. She says you’re making excuses, and maybe you are. The pain is real, but when you’re let off the hook, or you have no choice but to do the work, you feel better. 

The grocery store might already be sold out of turkey. A sculpted log of processed meat made to appear bird-like isn’t likely to cut it this time. But just as you’re reaching over the coffee table for the jar where you always keep your car key, you notice that the jar is empty. The key is gone.

You can’t seem to look away. The key has been in that jar all morning, hasn’t it? Yes! You’re positive! You slump on the couch. You’re thinking, this is how Schrodinger would feel when he lifts the lid, expecting the cat to be either dead or alive, only to find the box empty. 

What would Schrodinger do? Scratch his head, shrug his shoulders, chuckle, then shove another cat into the box?

Sounds like a plan. Moving on, you scan the room, mentally retracing your steps since waking up. You crack the curtain to check on the car. You’re a tad disappointed to see the old Civic still there. Gina bought that used off some guy on craigslist. She looked it over and asked him if it ran OK.  He told her the engine operates at 2% efficiency and its primary source of propulsion comes from its exhaust.  It sounded legit. She paid full asking price. She has the same taste in cars as men. 

These days, she wouldn’t be caught dead in that car. She’d rather jog, then comment on how sore and sweaty she is. Sometimes you tease her about doing things the hard way just so she could complain about it later, but then one day she glares at you, “It’s better than complaining to get out of doing the hard stuff!”

It occurs to you that Gina could have taken the keys. Maybe she’s not really in a meeting like she said. Maybe when she asked you not to interrupt her no matter what, she was testing to see how far you’d go to do to what you said you’d do. You text: “Did you take my keys?” 
    
   Her response comes so fast, it must have been pre-drafted, ready to send with a tap of her finger. “Unbelievable! I told you not to bother me, I’m in a meeting!” 

You wonder what she predicts you’ll say next, but then, out of curiosity, you decide to text something random. “Thanks for the bananas.” She made you promise not to buy bananas. She doesn't like them, and you have the habit of eating one, then letting the rest of the bunch go black, stinking up the place. 

Instant response. “I’m in a meeting! No excuses!” 

You wait for her to read the text. You're staring at the phone, counting down in your head. Here it comes. Ding. “Seriously? Bananas! You’d better not still be sitting on the couch!”  
 
Of course you’re still on the couch, but you respond, “Ha Ha” neither confirming nor denying, demoting her jab into a friendly inside joke between you two that you totally get, ha ha, even if she doesn’t.  

You get off the couch. Stretch. The keys probably fell on the floor or something. You drop to your knees and sift through the rubbish under the coffee table. You search the bookshelves and kitchen countertops and dump your dirty clothes on the floor, patting down the pockets of your jeans. No keys.

The house is a mess, even by your standards. Gina had other plans for you today, but the house will need to be cleaned anyway. You might as well straighten up the place and relax. The keys will show up eventually. 

Hours go by, and the house is as clean as it’s ever going to be.  You even went a little above and beyond, scrubbing the tiles while you took a shower.  

Gina has been texting you all day. She wants to know about the keys and whether you got the extra foldout chairs from storage like you promised, and if not, when can she expect that to be done? You hadn’t, but you didn’t want to be lectured on what happened a few years ago when you forgot and all her grandparents had flown 2150 miles to eat Thanksgiving dinner on your couch. 

You’re not sure what to do next. The keys never showed up. And just as you’re thinking that, from the corner of your eye, you catch the glint of something sparkling in the sunlight, the car key. They’re sitting in the jar on your coffee table, right where they were supposed to be.

You’re focused on that jar, gliding closer, expecting the illusion to fade away.  Even as you pick up the key and bounce it in your palm, testing the weight of it, it doesn’t seem possible. You close your fist and squeeze it. You notice then teeth biting in your skin, and you’re thinking about that fool, Craig.  How do you like the universe now, buddy, when it doesn’t fit your rules and formulations. The cat reappears, multiplies, or crawls away, and you can’t explain it. You haven’t a clue. You’d probably blame insanity, carbon monoxide, or food poisoning rather than actually look at it, rather than risk disrupting your beautiful, immutable model of reality. 

Ding, probably Gina. You check your phone. It’s an updated shopping list. At the end, Gina adds, “What have you been doing all day!!!”

You’re thinking that a question that ends with three exclamations marks isn’t a question. You send, “Will explain later, but I think God just tricked me into cleaning the house.” 


3.
When you return from the store, Gina is making herself some diner. Over the years, she’s become immune to flavor, so now, her diet consists of hoppy beer and a bowl of salad dressing with lettuce shreds sprinkled on top.

“Thanks for cleaning the house,” she says. She’s crouched down now, rustling through the grocery bags, pulling things out and then putting them back in again. She’s listing items as they come to her, asking if you got it. 

“I got everything on the list,” you say, but she’s already digging through the bags a second time. You see her, just another mouse in the cage, frantic, predictable, wasting all of her time on worries, regrets, fears. She can’t keep her body still for one minute. She grumbles to her herself all day, disruptively, never comfortable, never satisfied. She drinks three beers to get through work, adding hours to her day fretting needlessly, squeaking along, spinning around the hamster wheel. Bombards you with details before telling you what she’s talking about. Asks if she can ask a question, but then she lectures, digresses, qualifies what she’s about to say, which qualifies the next statement, boxing you in, pushing you towards the exit, where presumably a question awaits. The whole time, you’re waiting, trying to make sense of this barrage of information.  Please, stop talking. 

“I don’t see the cranberries.” Gina’s voice cuts deep. Karen has arrived. 

“I had to go to three different stores. I already told you. I got everything on the list. So why, it doesn’t make sense, why do you keep pestering me when you could just check the goddamn list.” You’re not shouting, but blood is surging up your neck, head throbbing. Your voice has taken on a frustrated tone, easily mistaken for anger. 

Gina pulls out a can of cranberries and holds it up. The brand logo shows a picture of a fat, happy turkey oozing fresh cranberries from its orifice. At the store, you laughed, but now you’re not in the mood to point it out like you’d planned.

Gina’s pissed. “I said I needed fresh cranberries.” 

“No, you didn’t.” Either way, the cranberries were probably fresh when they were canned.

She scrolls through the list, then points. She reads it, ‘WHOLE cranberries!’

“That’s right. I got you a whole can of cranberries.” Actually, you didn’t notice the word ‘whole’, but yeah, you waited too long. You did look, but the fresh cranberries were sold out. 

“Are you an idiot or do you just not pay attention? Do you ever leave your fucking head? Tell me, please explain to me why you believe that buying fractions of a can is not only a thing, but it’s so common that I’d need to specify, please buy the whole can?”

Rhetorical question, you assume.  “Well, I’m sorry, but you could have said ‘fresh’. I’m supposed to consider that you wanted me to buy a whole cranberry? Like just one?”

“Jesus Christ,” is all Gina says, under her breath. She almost never shuts up. She’d bring up old grievances or throw your unreliability in your face. But now, her eyes are fixed on you with an expression of calm rage. 

You close your eyes. It comes to you now, the vanishing keys. That happened. And it happened to you. Something anomalous. You know what you experienced, but still, it’s just a memory now, unreliable. But then what good are your senses, or your mind? What does it matter what happens or what you do?

But today, from somewhere outside space and time and this whole universe, a hand reached in and meddled in your life. The scientist, making one tiny adjustment, then taking notes from across the room. It’s not the key: it’s nudge. Somethings have changed. You just have to look around and see.  

Gina’s leaning over you, telling you not to worry. She looks scared. She’s fidgeting with her phone. You must have blacked out. You’re on the kitchen floor and Gina is scooting her leg under your head.  

For a moment there, you were in a dream. In the dream, there is Gina in a cage, just like you always imagined, as a mouse, going absolutely nuts in there. And on her back, there’s this other mouse, holding on and bouncing around. That mouse is you, presumably, and your angry because Gina won’t settle down, she won’t listen. So, you’re mocking her, belittling her, telling her to stop caring, give it a rest. 
   
“Yes I need an ambulance,” Gina says over the Phone. “I think my husband just had a brain aneurism burst.  Both eyes are completely red.” 

You don’t want to lie anymore. Your looking into Gina’s wet, brown eyes, your angel, your savior, and in the blur you catch your reflection. You could be anybody.

Chatty anti-authoritarian leftist here, with a boundless enthusiasm for Lord Of The Rings memes, a profound interest in building community & healing from trauma, and a fondness for most types of dance. Escaped former evangelical christian, grew up raised on 1800s orphan literature, currently moonlighting as an intimacy coach (when I am not busy loathing my corporate job). Very excited about medicinal plants (mostly the common local plants such as plantain, mullein, elder etc). I love to learn about the scientific approach to herbal medicine & also take a very animistic 'talking with the plants' approach. 

In the past I have led plant identification walks, and occasionally organize group intentional spaces such as full-moon drum circles. (If you think I might be too hippy for you, I probably am.) A big interest of mine in the past 5 years has been the question of how we can make alternative ritual spaces that meet the human desire for meaning and connection, without reproducing the harms of institutional high-control religion. I value kindness, clear communication, and self-awareness. I think industrial civilization in general and *technology in particular is fatally flawed* (she says on Al Gore's Internet), and I am interested in identifying our fundamental needs as human beings as we face collapse. 

I also like throwing parties, making a fancy cocktail, and cooking with/for folks. Central Portland. Love to go dancing and would love some pals for that. My favorite books of the last year were The Others Within Us by Robert Falconer (about Internal Family Systems therapy), The Wheel Of Consent by Betty Martin, and Coyote Healing by Lewis Mehl-Madrona, which gives you a rough idea of how nerdy I am. I'm not really a city folk and not really a country folk, but love aspects of both. Queer, intersectional feminist, not interested in hating people based on their identities.

1o393rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1o393rk/practicing_writing/,Practicing writing,"The context is I wanted to write the introduction to a story about long distance relationships. The man has to leave the woman for work. He is mandated to go to another country or else he faces legal consequences. Ultimately, they would end up together. In the middle, there’ll be character development and more conflict but for this purpose I wanted to first impressions, critiques, and suggestions on stronger writing and development.

Practice: On the bus, the woman’s head rested on the man’s shoulder, and his on the head rest. It was an early morning, earlier than the woman was accustomed to and so she slept to the hum of the bus. Despite being intimately familiar with this time of day, the man dozed in and out of consciousness. Last night, he was restless in bed so he slept on the floor against the woman’s suggestion. For most of the time they knew each other, he slept on the floor with the exception of the first few dates and last night. It was what he was used to. He held her soft hands in his callused hands. Though he was sleepy, he couldn’t stop glancing at his watch every time the bus stopped. They had left later than he hoped for. He was nervous about the strike that had started earlier in the week leaving the airport understaffed. The bus revved off, stopped, the driver loaded the patrons luggage into the bottom space of the bus, and drove off. For an hour and a half, the two rode in the early dark morning to the airport.

Upon getting off at the airport, the two were met with lines that stretched from inside of the airport to the sidewalk near their bus. The eyes of the two met with an unsaid fear. The woman takes the man’s bookbag and hurries inside the building to his line, but is halted by an employee. The man approaches them as the intercom announced that all visitors who do not possess a travel ticket will be asked to leave the premise due to capacity. Across the airport from a corridor, a mix of employees and security guards began dispersing into the crowd and herding the lines. The airport erupted into a cacophony of complaints. The man glanced at his watch and then to the woman, who looked terrified. She asks him if he thought they could get coffee one last time, but before she could finish a crowd of people rushed onto them. He thought of the envelope he had to deliver. He couldn’t miss this flight. He pulled her to him and hugged her. He whispered into her ear before apologizing. The woman turned gray. He tells her he will reach out to her when he arrives in the new country.

[DeLonghi unknown model lol],"For context, I'm nowhere near an expert on making espresso but I've been making it for 10 years on a cheap (but long lasting) DeLonghi machine exactly like the one below. When I use pre-ground Illy espresso, I get excellent crema. I ground my own beans that I thought were high quality but got barely any crema. I have been doing research into grinders fit for espresso and think my basic Cuisinart burr grinder isn't fine enough when on the finest setting, but it seems to be finer than the pre-ground Illy I use. What matters when it comes to crema? I'm also looking to upgrade my machine since I'm \*positive\* I can get better tasting espresso with another without shelling out thousands, but I'm stuck on what to get that will be worth an upgrade. If you have any feedback on that, too, that would be great :) It probably isn't much but I'm looking to spend no more than $500. I appreciate how fast I can make espresso with this machine too, I usually don't give myself enough time to spend long on making my coffee in the morning.

No matter how bad I spiral, or whatever bad happens, having a coochie is like a small little thing that will always cheer me up and stabilize me. Gender dysphoria used to kick me even harder when entering depressive episodes, but nowadays it's like 95% reduced and I can actually move on and get back on track after one or two days. I'm actually happy in that regard. I never realized how bad my genital dysphoria was or that it could ever improve, but here we are and I still can't believe it.

Sure, the list of negatives or what my organ is or isn't could fill the yellow pages, but being quite happy and actually somewhat non-dysphoric about what is between my legs is something that will always make me incredible happy, no matter how bad I'm doing, I can't repeat that often enough.

I can dress how I want, I don't have to tuck or use copious amounts of tape, I don't have irritation or fear of getting blood circulation problems, I don't have to be paranoid about a bulge or fear about getting hatecrimed due to my genitals. I can sit and walk normally, I can look at myself without feeling shame.  I can just start my day and not even think about my genitals, I can pee without getting dysphoric. I feel and look a lot more normal naked, I'm not afraid of going to the doctors anymore. I actually look good naked, like it's harmonious.

I can't wait for springtime to actually go swimming again, the first time in about 20 years. I feel motivated to get fit again, to look nice and pretty and I can't wait to fall in love with a man again. Someone who will love me for me, with my background and not despite of it, and not for something I hate about myself. 

I think my vulva looks pretty from all angles and I'm really happy with my surgeon and his team. A few weeks ago I came to visit a friend and brought them all cake and they remembered my name and were so happy to see me again, we hugged and even cried tears of joy, it was really wonderful. I was in hospital twice for a total of 6 weeks with lots of complications, and they've all been so wonderful, it really feels like the nurses, the numerous doctors and even cleaning people helped me graduate into womanhood. 

I remember, one of the service staff always brought me two cups of coffee in the morning and little  pieces of chocolate and treats, and we talked every day like she was my babushka, it was really sweet. I knew everyone by name (I used to clean and serve food too, and I know how hard their job is, I think they've felt that from me) and they gave me back so much. During my initial SRS, my neighbours (co-patients) and I formed a sort of gang and spent all day together. We could talk about our progress, our routine and problems, we could cry into each others shoulders and exchange somewhat, it was like a SRS vacation camp and made the whole ordeal so much nice. We met up several times a day between our 'stuff' and doctors visits to go into nearby parks, to go shopping or helping each other out with makeup and the like. We ordered food, watched movies together - in the end we were about a dozend people staying together and we're all still in contact. It really couldn't have been a better experience, I was so afraid and we gave each other strength.

My new body gives me hope and for the first time, I can actually see myself in a non-distorted way. I'm a lot more at peace than ever before and feel like I finally have a good base to get started again. 

There is hope and I wish all of you to reach you goals and get your SRS if you desire to do so. ",18,1760121209.0,4tran4,6,0.88,False

**The Visuals:**
These are some seriously dense buds. The coloring is bright green that almost looks white under good lighting, covered in a thick layer of frosty trichomes. There are small, bright orange pistils throughout, and some purple sugar leaves framing the edges. The trichome coverage is impressive; there's visible kief everywhere. Structure-wise, these buds are compact and heavy for their size. Definitely going to need a grinder if you like it fine.

**The Nose:**
Opening the mylar bag, the nose hits you immediately with a creamy funk that has some similarities to strains like Governmint Oasis, but with a sweet berry layer underneath. It's loud and confusing lol.

**The Taste:**
The flavor profile shifts a bit from the nose. The berry notes come way more to the front on the smoke, giving off vibes similar to a Forbidden Fruit? (Ruby's Farms) Like a umari cherry, hard to explain unless you've had that exact strain OR had Lemon Cherry Z by Insa.

There's still a touch of cream and some light pastry notes in there, but that berry sweetness really dominates and lingers on the lips long after you're done. The smoke itself is clean and easy—no harshness to report. Dense buds meant a .4 joint was chunky but smoked smooth.

**The Effects:**
This is where White Boy Cookies separates itself from something like Sherb Cream Pie. The high is noticeably more alert and functional. There's a solid mood boost that comes through pretty quick, making it effective for mental relief without the heavy sedation. It's still relaxing enough to close out the day with, but you could also pair it with a cup of coffee in the morning and stay productive. The balance here is solid—therapeutic without being overwhelming or couch-locking.

**Final Thoughts:**
White Boy Cookies checks a lot of boxes. The bag appeal is strong, the flavor profile delivers for terp chasers, and the effects are functional enough for daytime while still being relaxing for evenings. At over 32% THC with a clean smoke and mood-boosting effects, this one's a standout.

We had an awesome time with our daughter at a local family halloween event yesterday afternoon. This morning, we had planned on going to a coffee shop together and those plans completely fell apart.

My wife thought I was taking too long getting our daughter's stuff ready for daycare this morning while at the same time she was frustrated that she hadn't had a chance to get dressed yet because she was watching the kid. I told her we should probably start getting out of bed earlier to which she took offense. Soon after, she passive aggressively states ""sorry \[kids name\], daddy is ruining our plans this morning"". Like really? Naturally, I told her she can go by herself today if she was going to be an asshole.

Our family is great, we love each other very much and are aligned well in all areas life considering the stress that having a child puts on a family.

Six active subscriptions.  
Hours spent watching endless tutorials about *the perfect system*.  
Every week, I’d find a new app that was going to be THE ONE that finally made me consistent.  

It never was.  

For a whole year, I got less done than ever before. But I kept convincing myself I just needed a better tool.  
The one with smarter reminders.  
The one with gamification.  
The one that *understood my brain*.  

---

### The breaking point

One night I couldn’t sleep.  
It was 2am, and I was lying in bed reorganizing my task list for the third time that week.  
My wife looked at me and said something that hit like a punch:  

*“You spend more time organizing your life than actually living it.”*  

I tried to argue. But she was right.  
I was so obsessed with finding the perfect productivity system that I’d forgotten to actually be productive.  

That stung more than I’d like to admit.  

---

### What I did instead

The next morning I did something radical:  
I canceled all my subscriptions. Every single one.  

Then I went to a shop and bought a cheap €3 notebook.  

Here’s the painfully simple system I started using:  

**Morning (5 minutes):**  
- New page  
- Write the date  
- List 3 intentions — not 20 tasks, just 3 things that actually matter  
- Break each into the smallest possible first step  

**Evening (2 minutes):**  
- Check what I actually did  
- No judgment, just awareness  
- Notice the patterns  

That’s it.  
No app.  
No pings or notifications.  
No fancy hacks.  

During my focus blocks, I started playing 40Hz binaural beats from a free playlist.  
Maybe it’s science, maybe placebo — but it trained my brain to think, *“OK, now it’s time to focus.”*  

---

### What happened next

**Week 1:** Completed about 40% of my intentions. Felt like I was failing.  
**Week 2:** Around 50%. But I started to see *why* I wasn’t finishing — I was being too ambitious or avoiding the hard stuff.  
**Week 3:** Hit 60–70%. Something started to click.  
**Week 4:** Some days I nailed it, some I didn’t. But I showed up every day. And that was the real win.  

---

### The real transformation

It wasn’t about doing more — it was about *who I was becoming*.  

I’d read *Atomic Habits* before, but it finally made sense:  
“Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become.”  

Every time I opened that notebook, I was voting for the identity of *someone who follows through*.  

No app could do that for me.  
Because the problem wasn’t the technology.  
It was me — avoiding the uncomfortable truth:  

Discipline is built through boring, consistent action.  
Not through clever systems.  

---

Three months later, I still use that same beat-up, coffee-stained notebook.  
It’s full of crossed-out lines and messy notes.  
And it’s easily the most valuable productivity tool I’ve ever owned.  

---

### The lesson nobody wants to hear

You don’t need a better system.  
You just need to keep small promises to yourself — especially when you don’t feel like it.  

Start with pen and paper.  
Start with 3 intentions.  
Start with showing up for one week.  

The magic isn’t in the tool.  
It’s in showing up — imperfectly, but consistently.

I purchased a PS5 Pro with my Capital One card and in my Rewards account it has always said that it was an ineligible purchase. I reached out to them the very beginning of September about it and never heard a single thing back. Looking at all of the terms, the item is not listed as ineligible.  
  
The ONLY thing I can think of is that part that says ""Not eligible for orders deemed by Walmart to be used for reselling purposes."" But I don't know, because I have never received a reply about it. And how can Walmart just ""deem"" something like that? That's saying they could deem ANY and ALL purchases as being used for reselling and deny EVERYONE'S purchases for that reason alone if they wish to. How does Walmart determine this? It was not resold, it's sitting right here in my living room connected to the new 75"" tv I also purchased with my Capital One card.  
  
I feel like I was scammed by both Capital One & Walmart on this. For the ""16% Rewards"" email offer that was ""JUST FOR YOU!!!"", and then Walmart denying it.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

1o38m8j,https://i.redd.it/0ckprz90sbuf1.jpeg,"From Root to Radar: The Curious History of Carrots, Technology, and Wartime Mythmaking","The history of carrots and radar is not only the meeting of a humble root and a revolutionary invention, but a story of how culture, agriculture, science, and myth become entangled in ways that no one could predict. To understand why carrots became tied to the secret of radar, one must begin with the carrot itself, for this vegetable has a lineage stretching back to antiquity and carries within its flesh the record of human domestication, trade, and symbolism. When the wild carrot, *Daucus carota*, first attracted human attention thousands of years ago, it was far from the sweet orange root that most of the world takes for granted today. Growing across Eurasia, it was a spindly, bitter plant with thin roots more fibrous than edible, valued by early peoples mainly for its aromatic leaves and seeds. The seeds were used as medicine by Greeks and Romans, recommended for everything from digestive troubles to aphrodisiac properties. In classical antiquity, carrots were not yet the cultivated staple we know, but they already carried an aura of usefulness, a plant straddling the line between food and remedy.

By the early medieval period, the carrot had begun its slow journey of transformation. Islamic scholars and agriculturalists of the Abbasid period described purple and yellow varieties, cultivated in Persia and spreading westward through trade and conquest. When these cultivated strains reached Europe, they began to appear in monastic gardens and peasant fields, though still very different from the modern carrot. They were often tough, sometimes bitter, and lacked the uniformity that later selective breeding would bring. Yet their appeal lay in their hardiness, their ability to grow in poor soils, and their capacity to be stored for winter months. These traits meant that carrots gradually took root in the diets of Europe and Asia, even if they were not yet celebrated as delicacies. The carrot thus became part of the long history of root vegetables that sustained populations in times of scarcity, joined by parsnips, turnips, and beets.

The great transformation of the carrot came during the early modern period, particularly in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Dutch horticulturalists, famed for their skill in plant breeding, worked to improve the carrot into something sweeter, larger, and more uniform. Orange varieties began to emerge, not only because of genetic chance but also because of careful selection. The popular story that the Dutch bred orange carrots to honor the House of Orange is debated by historians, but what is clear is that the association between orange carrots and Dutch pride became strong, whether the link was political intention or retrospective symbolism. By the eighteenth century, the orange carrot had become dominant in much of Europe, outcompeting the purple and yellow forms. This was not only because of aesthetics but also because orange carrots were sweeter and more palatable, and because their beta-carotene content gave them nutritional benefits that would later become scientifically understood.

By the nineteenth century, carrots had become a fixture of European diets and agricultural systems. They were grown widely, used not only for human food but also as fodder for livestock. Their reputation for contributing to health, particularly eye health, grew alongside a general cultural association between vegetables and moral improvement. In the Victorian period, eating vegetables was not only a matter of diet but of discipline, of temperance, of aligning the body with ideals of cleanliness and moderation. Carrots, with their sweetness and bright color, became part of this broader symbolic field. They were fed to children to make them strong, recommended by doctors for their healthful properties, and incorporated into cookbooks that ranged from the peasant kitchen to the middle-class household.

The science that would eventually explain the link between carrots and vision did not emerge until the twentieth century. The key lies in beta-carotene, a plant pigment that gives the carrot its characteristic color. The human body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A, which is crucial for vision, particularly in low light, because it is a precursor of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina. A deficiency in vitamin A leads to night blindness, a condition long observed but not fully understood until nutritional science matured. Thus, while eating carrots beyond what the body needs does not sharpen vision beyond normal limits, a lack of vitamin A can indeed impair vision severely. This kernel of truth, the idea that carrots improve sight, was enough to ground the myth that would later be weaponized in wartime propaganda.

Meanwhile, carrots were spreading globally through colonialism and trade. European empires carried them to the Americas, where they were integrated into new agricultural systems. In Asia, carrots mixed with older local varieties, leading to a diversity of shapes, colors, and culinary uses. In Japan, for instance, the traditional red carrot remained distinct from European orange types. In India and the Middle East, carrots were used in sweets as well as savory dishes, shredded into puddings or pickled for flavor. The carrot thus became a truly global vegetable, adaptable and versatile, a crop that moved with people, armies, and merchants. By the early twentieth century, it was a commonplace ingredient almost everywhere, no longer exotic, but still carrying a cultural and symbolic resonance as food of health, resilience, and survival.

The story of radar begins in a wholly different domain, not in fields and kitchens but in laboratories and experimental stations. Its roots lie in the physics of electromagnetic waves, first explored by James Clerk Maxwell in the nineteenth century, who mathematically demonstrated that light, electricity, and magnetism were manifestations of the same underlying force. Heinrich Hertz, in the late 1880s, proved Maxwell’s theory by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, showing that invisible radiation could be transmitted through space and reflected off objects. This experimental foundation opened the door to technologies that would eventually include wireless telegraphy, radio broadcasting, and, ultimately, radar. By the early twentieth century, inventors and engineers were aware that radio waves could bounce off solid objects, but the practical use of this fact for detection and ranging remained undeveloped.

The interwar years were the crucible in which radar began to take form. As tensions rose in Europe and Asia, military planners recognized the growing threat of aircraft, which could strike targets far from frontlines with little warning. Visual spotting and sound detection methods were inadequate in an age of faster planes and larger bombing fleets. Across several countries, Britain, Germany, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union, researchers began to experiment with using radio waves to detect aircraft. The British effort, in particular, gained momentum in the early 1930s when Robert Watson-Watt, an engineer with experience in radio and atmospheric phenomena, was asked whether a “death ray” could be built to disable enemy planes. He concluded that such a weapon was not feasible, but suggested instead that radio waves could be used to detect aircraft at a distance. In 1935, he and his assistant Arnold Wilkins successfully demonstrated the principle by detecting a plane at several miles’ distance using radio transmissions.

From this experiment grew the British Chain Home radar system, a network of tall transmitting and receiving stations built along the coast, designed to provide early warning of incoming raids. By the time the Second World War began, Chain Home was operational, giving the Royal Air Force a decisive advantage. While the German Luftwaffe relied on traditional scouting and navigation methods, the RAF could see raids forming over the Channel, direct fighters to intercept, and conserve its limited resources. During the Battle of Britain in 1940, radar proved its worth: it allowed outnumbered British forces to meet the enemy with uncanny precision, preserving strength and preventing surprise attacks. The role of radar in Britain’s survival cannot be overstated, it was one of the key reasons the island held out against what could have been overwhelming aerial assault.

Here is where carrots re-enter the story. The extraordinary success of British night-fighter pilots posed a question that could not be openly answered: how were they able to spot enemy aircraft in the darkness of blacked-out skies? The official line, disseminated through newspapers, radio, and posters, was that their remarkable night vision was due to eating carrots. This was propaganda with a purpose. The British government wanted to keep radar secret, but it also needed to explain success in a way that was both plausible and inspiring. The carrot, with its existing reputation for promoting good eyesight, was a perfect cover. Campaigns encouraged the public to eat more carrots, which were plentiful compared to rationed imports. Children were told they would see better in the dark if they ate their carrots, and households were encouraged to cook them in inventive ways. In this way, a root vegetable became the mask that concealed one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the century.

The science of radar rests on the simple but powerful fact that electromagnetic waves can be transmitted through space, reflected by solid objects, and received again at a distance. The speed of light, nearly 300,000 kilometers per second, makes these reflections virtually instantaneous for practical ranges, allowing the time delay between transmission and reception to be used to calculate distance. In essence, radar systems function by sending out pulses of radio waves and measuring the echoes. From this, not only distance but also direction and even velocity can be inferred. What seems intuitive now was once a marvel of physics and engineering, for it required both theoretical insight and the technological means to generate and detect suitable radio frequencies.

The earliest practical radars of the 1930s operated on relatively long wavelengths, in the meter range, using cumbersome equipment and large antennas. Britain’s Chain Home system was emblematic of this stage. Its towers were enormous steel structures, rising up to 110 meters, strung with wires that broadcast high-powered radio signals. Receivers, placed at separate but coordinated locations, captured the faint reflections from distant aircraft. The system had its limitations, it was not precise in altitude measurement, and its resolution was crude compared to later radars, but it was revolutionary in providing advance warning. German bombers could be detected while still over Calais, giving British commanders time to mobilize defenses. The fact that such bulky, relatively primitive machinery could so drastically alter the course of battle speaks to the ingenuity of applying physics to immediate military necessity.

Radar technology was not static. As the war progressed, new discoveries and refinements transformed it from a coastal early warning system into a versatile tool used in nearly every theater of operations. One of the most critical breakthroughs came with the invention of the cavity magnetron, a device developed by British scientists at the University of Birmingham in 1940. The cavity magnetron allowed the generation of high-frequency microwave radiation with unprecedented power. This made it possible to build radar sets that operated at shorter wavelengths, in the centimeter range, which dramatically increased resolution and allowed for smaller antennas. The implications were immense: radar units could now be mounted on aircraft, on ships, even on vehicles, enabling detection of submarines, navigation through poor weather, and precision bombing at night. The magnetron was so important that it was shared with the United States in the Tizard Mission, a moment of transatlantic scientific collaboration that helped secure Allied dominance in radar technology.

In the air war, radar played a dual role: detection and targeting. Ground-based radar guided interceptors to their targets, while airborne interception radar allowed pilots themselves to locate enemy planes in darkness or cloud. The RAF’s night fighters, such as the Bristol Beaufighter and later the de Havilland Mosquito, were equipped with these systems, turning the tide in nocturnal engagements. German bombers that had once expected relative safety under cover of night found themselves hunted with uncanny accuracy. To the average observer, it seemed as though British pilots had developed supernatural night vision. This was the illusion that wartime propaganda was designed to sustain, with carrots serving as the perfect explanatory myth.

On the seas, radar was equally transformative. One of the gravest threats to Allied supply lines was the German U-boat campaign in the Atlantic, which sought to sever Britain’s lifeline by sinking merchant shipping. Early in the war, U-boats prowled the seas with devastating effectiveness, submerging by day and surfacing at night to attack convoys. Radar changed this dynamic. Shipborne radar sets, and later airborne radar mounted on patrol aircraft, allowed U-boats to be detected even at night or in poor weather. What had been an invisible predator became visible, and the balance of power began to shift. The Battle of the Atlantic was not won overnight, but radar was among the key technologies that turned the tide, reducing losses and ensuring that Britain could continue to receive supplies of food, munitions, and raw materials.

On land, radar also found diverse uses. Mobile radar units could track artillery shells, allowing counter-battery fire with new precision. Radar-guided anti-aircraft guns increased the accuracy of defenses against bombing raids. Even weather radar, a byproduct of the technology, began to provide insights into atmospheric conditions, though its full development would come later. The sheer versatility of radar underscored its status as one of the decisive scientific technologies of the Second World War, comparable in importance to the breaking of codes at Bletchley Park or the development of the atomic bomb.

The secrecy surrounding radar was intense. Unlike the Manhattan Project, which produced physical weapons whose use could not be disguised, radar was an invisible edge, its power lying in perception and detection rather than destruction. To maintain the advantage, the British government needed to conceal its true capabilities while still explaining to the public why RAF pilots seemed preternaturally effective, particularly in nighttime engagements. The carrot myth was the chosen cover story, and it was promoted with deliberate enthusiasm. Posters showed wide-eyed children munching carrots, slogans linked carrots to improved sight in blackouts, and recipes were circulated for carrot-based dishes to keep morale high under rationing. The Ministry of Food encouraged citizens to substitute carrots for scarcer ingredients, integrating the vegetable into cakes, stews, and drinks. Carrot marmalade and carrot coffee became symbolic of the ingenuity demanded by rationing, and the narrative that carrots were aiding both the health of the population and the vision of its defenders was irresistible.

The propaganda was effective not only because it served a practical cover function but also because it tapped into deeper cultural associations. The idea that foods could confer specific powers, strength from spinach, vision from carrots, intelligence from fish, was widespread and resonated with folk beliefs as well as emerging nutritional science. The link between vitamin A and eyesight provided just enough scientific plausibility to make the claim stick. It was far easier to persuade the public that carrots sharpened vision than to attempt to explain the complex physics of cathode-ray oscilloscopes and magnetrons. In this sense, carrots became a bridge between scientific secrecy and public comprehension, a folk explanation masking a technical reality.

For the pilots themselves, the story had a double-edged quality. While many were undoubtedly aware of the radar systems that guided them, the public-facing narrative emphasized their own heroic abilities enhanced by diet. This flattered them in one sense but also concealed the role of invisible machinery and ground crews. Yet in war, myth often serves as much as fact, and the carrot narrative became part of the larger mythos of Britain’s wartime resilience. Eating carrots was not merely an act of nutrition but of solidarity, of sharing in the same secret strength that made the RAF victorious in the night skies.

Meanwhile, the Germans were not oblivious to radar. They too had developed radar systems, including the Freya and Würzburg sets, and they employed them for air defense and naval operations. But the scale and integration of British and later Allied radar networks outpaced German efforts. The secrecy around the magnetron in particular kept the Allies ahead in microwave radar technology, which had greater resolution and flexibility than German systems. Had the Germans realized sooner the extent of radar’s contribution to their defeats, they might have invested more heavily in countermeasures. They did eventually develop devices to detect radar emissions and attempted jamming, but by then the momentum of technological innovation and deployment favored the Allies. The carrot myth, in its small way, may have helped obscure the true extent of the British edge, giving cover to a race of science and engineering that was as decisive as any clash of armies.

Thus, during the height of the war, carrots and radar became bound together in the public imagination. One was tangible, familiar, a vegetable grown in gardens and fields, eaten in stews and soups, sliced into lunch boxes. The other was intangible, secret, a cascade of invisible waves bouncing through the sky, deciphered by glowing screens and headphones in darkened rooms. Together they formed a story that was both true and false, a narrative in which the simple was used to mask the complex, the ordinary to conceal the extraordinary. The history of science is often told through the march of discovery, but here we see the history of myth intertwined with technology, showing how narratives of food and health can be harnessed to guard the secrets of war.

When the guns of the Second World War fell silent, radar emerged not as a temporary expedient but as a permanent feature of modern life. What had begun as an urgent wartime technology was rapidly integrated into peacetime infrastructure, reshaping aviation, meteorology, navigation, and even consumer technology. Just as the carrot, once a wild and fibrous root, had been transformed into a staple food through centuries of cultivation, radar too was domesticated, brought from the secretive laboratories of war into the everyday workings of civil society. Both retained traces of their extraordinary past, yet both were reabsorbed into ordinary existence, the vegetable into meals and the device into the invisible scaffolding of modernity.

In civil aviation, radar was indispensable. Commercial air travel was poised to expand dramatically in the postwar years, and the need for safe navigation and air traffic control was paramount. Radar systems, once used to guide fighters into nocturnal combat, were adapted to monitor the skies for passenger aircraft, coordinating takeoffs and landings, preventing mid-air collisions, and enabling safe passage through poor visibility. The air traffic control centers that grew up around major airports became temples of this new radar-guided order, with screens sweeping in slow circles, luminous blips representing aircraft guided by unseen beams. For the traveler, the process was invisible, but safety depended upon it, just as wartime survival had depended upon it for bomber crews and fighter pilots.

Meteorology also underwent a revolution thanks to radar. During the war, operators had noticed that radar screens often displayed echoes not from enemy aircraft but from rain, snow, or storm fronts. What was once considered clutter or interference was soon recognized as an opportunity. By studying the patterns of these reflections, meteorologists could track weather systems in real time. Radar became the backbone of modern weather forecasting, allowing storms to be monitored as they developed and moved. The ability to track rainfall patterns, to predict hurricanes, to observe the internal structures of storms, all of this became possible thanks to the adaptation of a wartime invention to the science of climate and atmosphere. If radar had once helped pilots defeat enemies in the night sky, it now helped societies prepare for the onslaught of nature itself.

At sea, radar became standard equipment for commercial and military vessels alike. The days when ships could vanish into fog or darkness, colliding with unseen obstacles or other vessels, were numbered. With radar, coastlines, icebergs, and other ships appeared as echoes on screens, reducing accidents and enabling safer navigation through treacherous waters. In polar exploration, radar proved invaluable in detecting ice formations; in fishing industries, it aided in locating shoals. The world’s oceans, vast and unpredictable, were rendered just a little less mysterious by the sweep of radar beams.

The Cold War amplified the role of radar further still. With nuclear bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles looming as existential threats, radar became a central pillar of defense systems. Early warning networks were established across the Arctic Circle, with lines of radar stations designed to detect incoming Soviet aircraft or missiles. These networks, such as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line in North America, were feats of engineering in hostile climates, a global infrastructure of vigilance. The development of radar-guided anti-aircraft systems and missile defense networks deepened this dependence. If wartime radar had protected Britain from the Luftwaffe, Cold War radar was intended to protect entire continents from annihilation. The scale had grown almost beyond imagination, yet the principle remained the same: pulses of radio waves, reflected back from distant objects, translated into patterns on screens that spelled life or death.

Parallel to these technical and strategic advances, the carrot myth lived on in popular culture, stripped of its wartime purpose yet enduring as nutritional folklore. Parents continued to tell children that eating carrots would help them see in the dark, often invoking pilots of the Second World War as proof. The story entered the realm of received wisdom, repeated without awareness of its propagandistic origins. In schools and households, the link between carrots and eyesight was taught as though it were established fact. The scientific reality, that vitamin A prevents night blindness but does not bestow superhuman vision, was far less compelling as a narrative. And so, the myth endured, perpetuated by its simplicity and by the appeal of the carrot itself: bright, sweet, unthreatening, a vegetable children could be persuaded to eat if told it would give them powers.

Nutrition science advanced steadily in the latter half of the twentieth century, identifying the biochemical pathways by which beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A, clarifying the role of retinol in retinal health, and linking deficiencies to conditions like xerophthalmia. These facts did little, however, to dislodge the cultural hold of the carrot story. Indeed, in an age of increasing skepticism toward scientific complexity, the carrot myth seemed almost preferable, a homely, digestible truth that fit neatly into everyday experience. Here, once again, the parallels between carrots and radar resurface. Radar itself became invisible to the public, a background technology rarely explained in detail. Air travelers trusted their safety to it without understanding its mechanics, just as children trusted in carrots to sharpen their eyes without grasping the molecular science. Both radar and carrots became part of the fabric of life, their deeper realities hidden, their myths more accessible than their truths.

This raises larger questions about the relationship between myth and science. Human beings crave explanations that are not only true but comprehensible, that fit into familiar categories of cause and effect. When the true explanation is too technical, too abstract, or too secret, a substitute emerges. The wartime carrot myth was a deliberate substitute, crafted by propagandists to conceal radar, but it was so effective because it tapped into a deeper pattern of human thought. We prefer the tangible to the intangible, the edible to the invisible. It was easier to believe in the power of a root vegetable than in the reflection of radio waves bouncing across the night sky. In this sense, carrots and radar symbolize two poles of knowledge: one grounded in the soil and bodily experience, the other in the ether and abstract mathematics. The narrative bridge between them was built by necessity but endures as cultural memory.

Postwar Britain, still under rationing into the 1950s, retained the carrot as a symbol of thrift and resilience. Cookbooks of the period offered inventive carrot recipes, some of them direct continuations of wartime improvisations. The association between carrots and national endurance lingered, even as the technology that had necessitated the myth expanded into new domains. Across the Atlantic, American culture embraced radar as part of its Cold War mythology, presenting it in popular science magazines, in films, in visions of a future where electronic eyes would watch over everything. The vegetable and the device diverged in cultural space, yet their wartime entanglement had already fused them in history.

The legacy of this entanglement is more than anecdotal. It illustrates the way narratives shape public understanding of science and technology, and how myths can persist long after their origins are forgotten. Few remember today that the carrot myth was wartime propaganda designed to conceal radar; many still repeat the claim that carrots improve eyesight. In this sense, the myth has outlived the secrecy it was designed to protect, a ghost story of nutrition haunting the collective imagination. Meanwhile, radar has become so integrated into the infrastructure of modernity that it, too, is invisible, rarely questioned, rarely explained, simply accepted as part of the way the world works.

Carrots and radar, then, stand together as emblems of the intersection of the ordinary and the extraordinary. The carrot, pulled from the soil, eaten raw by children or boiled into stews, became the symbol of a story that concealed a technology shaping the fate of nations. Radar, forged in secrecy, altering the balance of war, reshaping the globe in peace, was hidden behind the myth of a vegetable. Each illuminates the other: the carrot shows how myths grow from kernels of truth, and radar shows how science reshapes human life in ways that demand myths to make them palatable. Together they reveal how history is made not only by inventions and discoveries but by the stories we tell to explain them, whether those stories are true, false, or somewhere in between.

In reflecting upon this intertwined history, one cannot help but see a kind of poetry. A root that once grew wild and unremarked upon in Eurasian fields became a tool of deception in the deadliest war the world has known. A series of equations scribbled by Maxwell in the nineteenth century became a weapon of survival in the twentieth. Both were enlisted into the service of myth, one to mask the other, one to stand as proxy for secrets that could not be shared. Today, when we eat a carrot or watch a plane guided safely to land by radar, we participate; unknowingly; in this layered history of sustenance, science, and storytelling. The soil and the sky, the root and the wave, remain bound together in memory, proof that even the most unlikely companions can share a destiny in the annals of human ingenuity.

1o38ki2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1o38ki2/problems_with_tropical_fruit_eggs/,"Problems with tropical fruit, eggs?","I recently started the low FODMAPS diet to try to resolve some constant bloating I was feeling. One of my other main symptoms was certain high FODMAP foods would trigger insane skin reactions--painful pimples around my mouth. I started S. Boullardii and noticed my skin and stomach feeling better, and the low FODMAP helped even more. 

My nutritionist suspects SIBO and recommended the low FODMAP diet. 

One thing I have noticed, though, is that foods that should be fine, such as pineapple, kiwi, and eggs, seem to trigger stomach, and possibly skin reactions. I'm not sure what else could be triggering it, though I do drink cream with my coffee and have been using butter more regularly than normal, to better accommodate the diet. I do have an allergy to papaya, and it causes both skin and stomach reactions with me. Does anyone else have problems with FODMAPs in low fodmap fruits or eggs? Or, could I have a tropical fruit sensitivity alongside SIBO? What could explain the issues with eggs? 

Any insight appreciated",1,1760120133.0,FODMAPS,3,1.0,False

I’m originally from NW Houston but have lived in Austin for almost 13 years. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering leaving Austin and potentially moving back to Houston. I know a lot of people have moved from Houston to Austin, but I don’t know many people who have moved from Austin back to Houston, so I’d love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar move or lived in either place.

A bit about me:

* I’m 32 and work in social media and content creation. I was a social media manager at a marketing agency for the last year and a half but was just laid off unexpectedly and am looking for a new role now. I'm also working toward becoming a full-time content creator.
* I always dreamed of living in Austin and I still love it, but after 13 years I’m starting to wonder if this chapter has run its course. Lately, it feels like the city isn’t supporting the life I’m trying to build.
* I’m craving more career stability, a lower cost of living, and overall better quality of life.
* I was born and raised in Houston (Cypress/Tomball area) and would like to live somewhere new in the city (inside the loop) if I move back.
* I have family and friends in Houston I’d love to spend more time with.
* I’m also newly single and eventually want to get back into dating.
* I have a dog and love nature, parks, water, and walkable environments. I currently live in East Austin, which is a fun, highly walkable area. I know Houston isn’t as walkable as Austin is but I'm hoping there’s some comparable areas?

I’m planning to visit Houston soon to see family and friends and check out houses and apartments. Some apartments I’ve been looking at: The Flats at West Alabama, Alta Sunset Heights, Bowen River Oaks, and Alexan River Oaks. I’d love insight from anyone who’s lived there or has suggestions for similar apartments or neighborhoods.

I’d also love your advice on:

* Do you think I’d be happy moving from Austin to Houston? With all the big changes happening in my life, I want to make sure this isn’t an impulsive decision I could possibly regret.
* Which areas in Houston are best for a single, creative, social 32-year-old woman who loves walkable neighborhoods with coffee shops, restaurants, workout studios, bars, etc?
* Any tips on building community, making new friends, or dating as a single woman in Houston?

**TL;DR:** Considering leaving Austin after 13 years to move back to Houston. Looking for safe neighborhoods/apartments that fit a creative, social, walkable lifestyle. Would love honest insight from people who’ve made the move or live in Houston. What’s life really like there for someone like me?

**If you've moved to Houston from Austin (or anywhere else), what's your honest take?**  
What do you love, what do you hate, and what do you wish you knew before moving there?

Thanks so much in advance! 🩵",2,1760120070.0,AskHouston,13,0.75,False
