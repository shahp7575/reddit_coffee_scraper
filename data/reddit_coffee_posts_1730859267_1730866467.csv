We met because at the time we were in the same college ministry and i went the church her family started. I moved in with her, her sister, her sisters best friend and my best friend.And at first we started to get really close hang out all the time. I felt really connected to her confided in her. That summer she got picked to go on a mission that I really wanted to go on. She ended up being able to bring one person along and she chose me. Over the course of we grew close but that's also when I began to the first open door to see who she was. There was this guy that she was absolutely in love with. During the trip him and I had an encounter where we were at a coffee shop with several people and he tells a story about how he believes in ufos. I thought it was a funny conversational piece for us say our opinions. When I said my thoughts about it he proceeded to yell at me and say I was belittling him in front of everyone. I was so caught off guard and embarrassed that I left. She had left with me along with one of our good friends. And in the car she proceed to defend him and stand up for a guy she didn't even know and that would talk to a woman that way in public. So this was the first of many events. Telling my best friend and I it was inappropriate of us to hang out with guy friend even though it was late and we would be in public. And also she would end up hanging out with guys if she wanted to. Over the course time more and more things would happen like this. If we didn't follow the way she wanted thing she would ignore me or the person she was mad at. I've watch her make several people cry including my best friend and I. I literally wait to come home until I know she's sleeping or isn't home. Literally she's the only roommate that we had to have a roommate meeting that she was bullying all of us. She probably the worse person I've ever met. And get this. Her parents run out church and basically she wanted to quick her job and so her parents of course a gave her the job she chose at church. She chose to work for young adults. The young adults section was started by two of out of our other good friends who I love. But because of her nepotism she got to take over. And also let me put this into perspective. She is getting money, like way more money than people that have worked at the church for years, just to work one day a week. She doesn't pay rent because her parents own our house, she gets to go on vacation whenever, and she just got engaged. And the thing is I can say anything bad about he because she's the pastors daughter, but she's literally a narcissist. I don't like her. I think she's a terrible person. Honestly I wish i could capture how awful she is. ",1,1730866321.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False
1gkpxcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gkpxcd/reopening_the_investigation_of_my_mothers_passing/,Reopening the investigation of my mothers passing for wrongful death.,"Good evening reddit. I'm going to TRY to keep this very professional and to the point. There are alot of circumstances, evidence, and time passed in this case since it happened in 2014. ‚ÄºÔ∏èüö®PLEASE READ AND PLEASE POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF HOW TO PROCEED WITH THISüö®‚ÄºÔ∏è

So, on 08/19/2014 my mother died in our home in Cartersville GA. At the time, me and my siblings were at school and it was her and my step dad at the house. My step dad raised me since I was a baby and even adopted me. When we got off the bus and we were rushed next door to the neighbors house as firetrucks, cops, and other emergency medical personnel arrived. My step dad was frantic and in tears and we were all just in shock.

At the time I was 16, my youngest brother was 12, my sister was 14, and our oldest brother was 23. Safe to say a VERY traumatic event to happen at that time and at those ages.

When I was a boy and only 16 alot of the truth about my mom's death were kept from me and also alot of dark family secrets as well. For one, my mom was hooked on pain pills during the final stages of her life. She was red flagged at the hospital even for purposely admitting herself to the ER to attempt to get pain meds prescriptions for her pain she had in her side/liver area. 

After my mother's sudden and unexpected passing, our step dad assured us we would stay in GA and regroup as a family and get through it all together. Not even a week later, he asks us to all come home and said we were moving to Ohio where his family is all from.

So we move to Ohio and my mom (who HATED Ohio and my step dad's family) was cremated at a funeral home in wellston Ohio. 

The night of, prior, or after my mother's passing (I can't really remember exactly) my step dad got drunk and slept with my mom's best friend who lived in wellston Ohio. This is confirmed by the entire family. And from then on, went on a fucking spree and would just constantly be trying to sleep with all the women he could.

One day, when I was using my step dad's phone to text my wrestling group chat about an upcoming tournament, I saw messages between him and my sister and WITH MY OWN EYES saw where he was inviting her to his room late in the night, telling her to remove her bra and not to sleep with a pillow in-between them anymore. I flipped and told my oldest brother and he didn't believe me and said I was overreacting. Nothing came of this. 

Fast forwarding to now and the NEW Information I have and that has came to light. First, this man flaunts how he was in the US Air Force and always on veterans day posts his head shot pic from basic and the family hero-fies him for his service. Recently I discovered that he was DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED after barley a year in service for sexual harassment/misconduct with a female airman. 
(I am currently in the works of obtaining this information and legal document stating this.)

My uncle, my cousin, my aunt, and other various family members have contested about his perverted and molesting behaviors over the years.
(I'm actively working on getting statements from ALL of them) 

REWINDING A BIT. As I stated, my mom was addicted to pain pills toward her final days. My parents were toxic and fought alot growing up and the relationship was not good. My mom suffered from bipolar disorder and a horrible childhood trauma and also being rapped as a young girl-teen. 

When my mom would abuse pain pills she would often times become unconscious from them. My family told me that my mom reached out to them that he was sexual molesting her when she was unconscious during this time. She also told her therapist this(I'm actively trying to find this therapist and track him down) 

My step dad was then put in charge of MONITORING her dosage and intake since she was abusing it. The day she died the police, coreners office, forensics all labeled it as a OD and no signs of foul play. 

HOWEVER, My mom was found in the bathroom floor with 2 black eyes, marks on her wrists/back arms/hands, and a dent in her forehead. (I have the autopsy reports) She was believed to be dead at the scene and was sitting on the toilet at the time of death. (Pee in the toilet as well) 

Of course, my uncle's and family members questioned my step dad about what really happened and he stated he found her like that and called the police immediately. 

They even pressured him to take a polygram test since if he was innocent it shouldn't matter and he would have nothing to hide. He denied and threatened legal reprocussions for harassment if they didn't leave him alone about it. 

My oldest brother believes, my step dad laced our mom's coffee, who she used to set out every night for the next morning with crushed up pills and that caused her to OD the day she died. 

Today, my older brother sent me a picture he received from a family that lived in the house after we moved out. The trim around the door entering the bathroom where she died has these words written on it ""I was raped and murdered in this bathroom please leave before it's too late"" üòµ‚Äçüí´üòñ

Every hair on my body stood up when I saw this picture. Apparently the little boy who lived there wrote this but if he was so little I'm wondering how could he even reach the top of the door to do so. (Actively reaching out to the property/home owners to contact them on the validity of this story) I do have the picture of the door and the words written on it. 

MY QUESTION NOW IS!!! With all of this information (ITS ALOT I KNOW) HOW DO I PROCEED??? 

TD;LR Mom was murdered and raped by molesting and sick step dad back in 2014. New evidence and information has been revealed to me about his sexual predator ways including molesting my sister his daughter. I'm wanting to re-open the death investigation of my mom's death for wrongful death and have him prosecuted.

Throughout the past few years I have been going to sleep after 3 am. It only got worse as days passed. 3 became 4 and then 5 and 6... I have been functioning on less than 4-6 hours of sleep. As a result, I feel so sleepy during the day. After dinner I have to take a nap. When I am in class I struggle to stay awake. Also, my naps are long like if go to sleep I can't wake up before 2 hours. The only time I used to sleep more than 6 hours was during the weekend. Even then I felt sleepy. I feel like I don't have quality sleep even if I sleep 8 hours. Most of the time I have these bad dreams that wakes me up or just don't let me sleep peacefully. I feel like I am half awake and half asleep. The only time I can sleep early is if I am really tired. In the summer when I had nothing to do, I couldn't fall asleep no matter how early I went to bed. Some days it would be 7 in the morning and I still couldn't sleep. Now that school started I feel tired and sleepy all the time again. But the problem is I can't stay awake until 5 like before. I need coffee to do that. When it's midnight, I have these extreme sleepiness like I have to sleep. But I don't want to sleep cause I have work to do so I end up falling asleep in my desk. Because of this sleep I missed my morning classes twice. I also missed other stuff because I couldn't wake up from my nap. This is so frustrating. I can't remember things well nowadays. I've lost interest in my studies and I am just tired all the time. I don't remember when was the last time I had good quality sleep like 8-9 hours without any dreams or disruptions. It's affecting my school work I can't get things done on time because of my sleepiness. Should I go see a doctor?

Not sure if it's relevant, but I had one episode of sleep paralysis a few months ago. And I am not diagnosed with anxiety or anything, but recently I started to have these episodes where I starts to feel nervous out of nowhere. My heart starts beating fast and I feel suffocated. I need to take deep breaths. This happens for literally no reason but it's not that bad like anxiety attacks or anything... it's just a little uncomfortable

TL;DR: My sleep schedule has deteriorated over the years. I don't get enough quality sleep and always feel exhausted. This cnstant daytime sleepiness affects my school performance, memory, and motivation. Recently, I started experiencing mild anxiety-like symptoms with a fast heartbeat, but it‚Äôs not severe.

Some context of the most recent example. I'm a full time student in online college, and also am a stay at home dad to our 2 year old son while we travel full time for her work. This leads me to having a very small amount of time to actually focus undivided on school work, and being in my junior year this work load has continued to grow larger. So I utilize tools to help explain concepts in a quicker manner than reading chapters upon chapters of class work, instead I typically use tools like chatgpt to summarize, or explain concepts as they come up in my class work, along with a VERY limited amount of proofreading and re-writing of run-on sentences in my papers. This allows for more time in my day/evening to either spend with my son, or with my wife and give them attention do stuff with them, when I could really use the more time focusing on school work. I know this is poor time management, but its a sacrifice I have been able to keep up with for 2+ years and has resulted in us doing so many amazing things together.  

In a week and a half we are planning on going on a cruise that we will be out for 12 days, so this will be basically 2 weeks of school work that I need to pre-complete in only a week or so time frame. So I'm allocating a lot more time and energy into my work, however this is at the expense of using more AI to summarize. This led me to wanting to get chatGPT+ for a month to help me get through this cramming session and understand the concepts quicker. Well, I voice this to my spouse and she immediately shuts it down and says that I can just read the book, and not have to ""cheat"" my way through college. (Mind you she uses it constantly at work for her duties daily).  I explain that it's a tool that I use, and that it helps me allocate the time that she is used to with me and our son together to do things together almost every day. We end taking some space for a couple hours while I went to a coffee shop to be able to focus, but when I return I try to talk with her about how her saying that I ""cheat"" completely undermines the reasoning behind why I utilize this tool. Along with making me feel as though she doesn't respect the amount of time and effort I have and continue to put into my school work. She than gives a half-hearted apology without actually being able to explain what she is apologizing about. As soon as I bring this up though she than shuts down on me and every question I ask after that is given either a 1 word answer or no answer at all. Culminating in her going to bed at 8:30, and me being left in the same situation that I begun in, feeling unheard and underappreciated, and worse than if I had just kept the emotions to myself. This is a consistent issue with her shutting down and only having conversations when she is able to control the ""rules of engagement"". I'm so frustrated at this point, that I am at the point of becoming less and less open about how I feel to her, and internalizing a lot of frustration that I have, in order to not ruin the night. I'm not sure how to better engage in conversation with her in order to keep her from being so drained by me when I come to her about something that I would be much more happy with having a back and forth conversation about. There was no point in tonight where I yelled or demeaned, or even pointed out something that wasn't a fact... I just wanted to give my side and my thought process behind things, but now I'm left feeling as though its better to just not. I just want to have a conversation and not a monologue about my emotions to then be talked about at a later time. ",1,1730865236.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm going to try to keep this short.

Currently love the job I have. I‚Äôm keeping it vague on purpose for obvious reasons, but I seriously do love what I do.

Pros:

I work 7-330 with a consistent schedule and weekdays off to make dr appointments, etc. I get two days off in a row. I love my job, there‚Äôs almost no customer service-my work is my work (there is teamwork involved but for the most part we let each other do our thing). It‚Äôs a very chill environment (though that might change soon due to acquisition). I get to wear what I want, within reason (they are discussing possibility of uniforms). They buy us lunch/breakfast/random treats 2x a month, sometimes more, and have a kitchen stocked with snacks and coffee, microwave, nice water filtration, sink, etc. Coworkers are great, direct supervisors are great. $17/hr, GREAT benefits. PTO, sick time, HSA. Raises after a year (been told recently they haven‚Äôt been as high as previously).

Cons: 

The company and new acquisition company are not ADA friendly. They‚Äôve ignored people‚Äôs ADAs for years and play dumb when they do respond, nor do they care about the safety of our environment. The A/C has been out for at least three months now and some of the electrical equipments are overloaded and have shocked people. People are desperately trying to leave and several have quit already, one due to ADA being ignored. Cut overtime even though we‚Äôre still short staffed. 

New opportunity:

UFCU hybrid role

Pros: 

WFH M, F, and rotating Sat

$1/hr more than current role

Would get overtime with rotating Saturday which I love overtime. 

Mandatory dress but I do love that office chic style anyway. 9-530 would give me a little extra time to sleep in but I do love getting off at 330‚Ä¶that was my dream schedule.

Cons:

Not one hundred percent sure since I‚Äôve never worked there but I‚Äôve read some pretty bad reviews about management, discrimination, mean girl cliques, insane high call volume and strict micromanaging, little compensation for the work required. 9-530, no time for doctors appointments and people have said they don‚Äôt get approved to go and then have to call out with their accrued sick time to go. 

Both jobs are 10 min away.

So, this happened yesterday, and I'm cringing just writing it out, but maybe sharing will help me feel less like an idiot.

I was at this popular daytime bar that closes at 6pm. It was around 2pm, and I was just chilling, watching some TV when I noticed two girls sitting at a table nearby. One of them caught my eye‚Äîshe was super attractive, so I decided to shoot my shot.

I walked over, started some small talk, and it actually seemed to be going alright. We were chatting about random stuff, they asked my name, I asked theirs, then we talked about what we did for a living. I even threw in a joke because it turns out one of them was 17, and I'm 21. I laughed and said, ""What are you guys doing here at a bar? Must be breaking the law or something‚Äîshould I call the cops?"" They both laughed, so I thought things were going well.

Then I went for it‚ÄîI told the attractive one I‚Äôd love to take her out for coffee sometime. And then she hit me with the classic, ""I have a boyfriend."" In front of her friend. Ouch.

I know rejection is just part of the game, but man, it really sucks when you put yourself out there, try to be confident, and still get turned down. Now I‚Äôm over here feeling awful, replaying everything in my head and wondering if I could have just avoided the whole thing by not going up to them in the first place. Doesn't help that I've been single my entire life, so this is even harder to take.

Has anyone else had something like this happen? How do you deal with rejection like this without it just feeling... brutal?

My dad is a 70 year old man so he takes naps in the afternoon my dad is somewhat allergic so when he would take his naps it would affect him we moved them into the living room. For over a year there has been no issues whatsoever. Another thing I want to point out is that we don‚Äôt get any company we don‚Äôt throw any parties my parents don‚Äôt go out they don‚Äôt do anything my mom doesn‚Äôt work doesn‚Äôt go out at all doesn‚Äôt go to even my aunts house on holidays (I will get into that later on). But for some reason this morning when I wake up my dad is going off on me about it being in the living room. Saying he doesn‚Äôt like how is living room looks that it‚Äôs cluttered and he wants to move it back in my room. He doesn‚Äôt try to compromise with me there‚Äôs no reasoning with my dad. He starts screaming at me telling me I‚Äôm going to do whatever I want in my house and that he‚Äôll throw my Guinea pigs out on the street if I don‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm calling for my mom because my mom told me a week ago that he was saying this and that she doesn‚Äôt agree with it. My mom usually is able to talk to my dad and calm him down or defuse the situation a bit. My dad only will listen to my mom he doesn‚Äôt believe any I could say is correct I don‚Äôt know anything in his eyes. But here my mom is basically justifying his actions when she was the one telling me a week ago that she doesn‚Äôt agree with it but now it‚Äôs she can‚Äôt do nothing about it. I‚Äôm crying having a panic attack my dad goes outside to smoke. I‚Äôm upset with my mom now and she‚Äôs in my face telling me I need therapy. And then I pushed my mom I didn‚Äôt push her hard just to get her out of my face I completely blacked out I didn‚Äôt even think I just reacted but bc she‚Äôs so fragile she sorta fell back she was in my face telling me I need therapy and basically justifying my dad going crazy over something that doesn‚Äôt affect anyone not even him why does it matter if the cage is in the living room we have no company ever it‚Äôs been like this for over a year and all of sudden he‚Äôs going crazy over it. And now bc I reacted like that I‚Äôm wrong but she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs wrong at all for telling me I need therapy and justifying my dad‚Äôs horrible actions. I know I‚Äôm wrong for doing that. I‚Äôm always the one that needs therapy but my mom never tells my dad who has problems since childhood which is the reason he has such anger he needed to go to therapy and he can still go but she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge it there‚Äôs no age limit to therapy. My mom still needs therapy from her eating disorder all her trauma she never finished her therapy sessions back then just stopped going in the middle of treatment spiraled when I was first born because having me brought up all her trauma from childhood but never seeked the help she needed so now that‚Äôs the reason she is the way she is and doesn‚Äôt think none of those things could‚Äôve affected me because she never abused me she was the one that got abused so she can‚Äôt believe for a single I could have any trauma from what they did I‚Äôm just a crazy anger spoiled brat that needs therapy to control my anger but they never look themselves in the mirror to realize a lot of my mannerisms are due to them and how they treat me and what they did and what I witnessed from them growing up but they won‚Äôt fix it they won‚Äôt go to therapy it‚Äôs ME who needs it And it pisses me off more that my mom is so sympathic and compassionate to everyone else around her my cousin whose in jail my aunts her AA friends she helps them but for me I have no reason to have any trauma I had such a ‚Äúgood‚Äù life growing up she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge she didn‚Äôt anything to hurt me for a second. 
I love my mom but the way she doesn‚Äôt try to help herself drives me insane and has just been building up for so long. I do need therapy I agree but to come in my face and tell me only when we‚Äôre fighting that I need therapy is not right. My mom had a bad childhood. I mean it was horrific. My mom was severely abused. My grandma burned her, broke her arms, bruised her, strangled her and verbally abused my mom even to her deathbed. My mom asked my grandma right before she died why she was hit the worst and her response was ‚Äúbc you were the middle child‚Äù absolutely no remorse as my mom took care of her the most out of her two sisters right before she died. My grandpa had schizophrenia and would randomly hit everyone in the house. My grandma died actually from so much damage from being punched in the stomach from my grandpa. This was back in the days when they had no idea about schizophrenia. Both of my grandparents died before I was born in their 50s. Although my mom had two sisters she was beaten and abused the worse. She developed an eating disorder because of this. Around the age of 12 she thought if she didn‚Äôt eat and got small enough her mom wouldn‚Äôt be able to see her to avoid getting hit. Later on in life she became an alcoholic and she ate nothing. The doctors at the time told her the only reason she‚Äôs alive is because of the sugar in the alcohol. She fortunately does not have an alcohol addiction anymore she has been sober for 30 years and goes to AA meetings. But my mom to this day is still struggling with an eating disorder she won‚Äôt admit she has. I‚Äôm pretty sure she weighs 85 pounds and eats absolutely nothing besides coffee and a few bites of food at night. To put it into perspective it takes her a whole week to eat ONE burrito. She has developed many MANY disorders and illnesses due to all of the stress and trauma of my grandparents and her own health habits. As far as I know she has fibromyalgia and neuropathy pain she has so many things she takes medication for I don‚Äôt even know the names of it.
She also broke her hip a few years back and after the surgery the mental rod in her leg will give her spasms randomly up her body. 
This all affects me super bad. I love my mother and I can tell her everything but it truly hurts watching my mom constantly in pain and never going out. It‚Äôs said to see her not live at all she‚Äôs basically surviving. Her mind wants to do so much but her body won‚Äôt allow her to. She had problems before I was born but having me brought back all the trauma from her childhood that she spiraled when I was little. She got too nervous to drive a car when I was around 7. She doesn‚Äôt even come my aunts house on holidays. We don‚Äôt go anywhere it‚Äôs very rare for my mom to go out. Since she broke her hip a few years back it‚Äôs been impossible now for her to go out. She can‚Äôt stand in our kitchen for longer than an hour without having to sit down or get a spasm. She‚Äôs constantly having stomach issues. I just get so frustrated because it feels like some of these problems can be fixed if she tried to fix her health. I feel her stomach issues and her spasms from her leg can be helped a bit if she just put on some weight to withhold her body. Her bones are so fragile and weak and she has absolutely nothing to support it. No doctors will remove the rod in her leg or try to fix it because she‚Äôs so thin and her leg will collapse. I have begged and cried to her to just try every week to just eat a little more than she did the last week. Take baby steps even if it‚Äôs every month every 6 months i don‚Äôt care but she insists she can‚Äôt that there‚Äôs no fixing it since it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs done since she was 12. I just feel so hopeless and no doctors ever have been able to help her. Her only answer to fix her problem is to find a new doctor and get a different type of medication. I tell her that medication is not going to fix her unless she tries to better herself first but she says she‚Äôs in so much pain how can she do that. She lives in agony pain everyday üôÅ. Am I being unreasonable for being frustrated? 

Growing up I witnessed her health decline she would pop pills so much that she would become high of it and pass out and faint whenever we tried to go out. Constantly I was embarrassed to show friends I had growing up my mom in fear they would make fun of me or her. My mom was constantly in the hospital for months on end I wouldn‚Äôt have her around. When I was younger i just didn‚Äôt have this love I should have for my mom and I felt guilty for it but I couldn‚Äôt help it her anxiety was horrible and made her do careless things. I felt I didn‚Äôt know what it was like to have a normal mother my dad was the one to come to every school event or drive me places and meet parents not my mom. She‚Äôs better and easier to talk to now I don‚Äôt feel I don‚Äôt love her but I feel I still hold this grudge towards her the fact that she won‚Äôt help herself bothers me and the little habits she does like blow dry her hair every 20 mins not try to eat at all smoke cigarettes all day only drink coffee and take baths all day just bother me so bad.

In today‚Äôs highly competitive business environment, creating and maintaining a strong brand identity is more crucial than ever. A brand‚Äôs identity reflects its core values, mission, and the emotional connection it seeks to build with its customers. Effective brand identity goes far beyond just a logo; it involves the consistent use of various design elements to convey a message, evoke emotions, and foster recognition. Graphic design, with its ability to combine visual elements like logos, typography, color schemes, and imagery, plays a central role in establishing and communicating a brand‚Äôs identity.



\#### The Role of Graphic Design in Branding



Branding is about creating a unique presence in the market that resonates with customers and distinguishes a business from its competitors. Graphic design is the visual language through which a brand speaks to its audience. When used effectively, it becomes an instrumental force in building recognition, trust, and loyalty. Here are some ways graphic design impacts brand identity:



1. \*\*Creating a Visual Identity:\*\*



   Graphic design provides a tangible, visual identity that customers can associate with a brand. A brand's logo, its colors, fonts, and other visual elements work together to create a cohesive identity that customers can instantly recognize. The logo, often the most prominent feature, represents the essence of the brand‚Äîits mission, values, and promise‚Äîwhile color schemes and typography evoke particular emotions or attitudes.



   For example, Coca-Cola‚Äôs red and white color palette, paired with its distinct cursive font, is instantly recognizable worldwide. This simple yet powerful use of graphic design reinforces the brand‚Äôs energetic and refreshing image, making it stand out in a crowded beverage market. Similarly, tech companies like Apple rely on sleek, minimalist design to convey innovation and modernity.



2. \*\*Differentiating the Brand from Competitors:\*\*



   In a saturated market, differentiation is key to attracting customers. Effective graphic design can set a brand apart from its competitors by visually communicating its unique values and personality. Through design choices such as color, shape, and typography, businesses can create a distinct visual language that customers can easily associate with their brand.



   For example, the use of bold colors or playful typography can signal a brand's fun and youthful nature, while muted tones and sophisticated fonts might appeal to a more professional, high-end audience. By carefully selecting and maintaining these visual elements, a business can establish itself as a unique player in its industry.



3. \*\*Building Brand Recognition and Recall:\*\*



   One of the primary goals of graphic design in branding is to ensure that the brand is easily recognizable and memorable. A well-designed logo and consistent visual language make it easier for customers to identify the brand across different platforms, whether it‚Äôs a website, social media, or physical store. The more frequently a brand's visual identity is encountered and consistently reinforced, the more likely it is that customers will remember it.



   Think of companies like Nike with its iconic ‚Äúswoosh‚Äù logo. Its simplicity and versatility ensure it can be easily recognized no matter where it appears, whether it‚Äôs on a billboard or a pair of running shoes. This kind of recognition fosters trust and makes customers feel more comfortable choosing the brand again and again.



4. \*\*Conveying Brand Values and Message:\*\*



   Graphic design is not just about aesthetics‚Äîit also communicates deeper messages about a brand‚Äôs values and what it stands for. Through design choices, a company can visually tell its story. Whether it‚Äôs a charity brand promoting kindness through soft colors and rounded shapes, or a luxury brand exuding sophistication through elegant typography and gold accents, design tells a story before a word is even read.



   For instance, Patagonia uses earthy tones and natural textures in its branding to communicate its commitment to environmental sustainability. The brand‚Äôs logo and designs evoke a sense of rugged adventure, aligning with its values of outdoor exploration and eco-consciousness.



5. \*\*Enhancing Customer Experience and Emotional Connection:\*\*



   Graphic design can significantly impact how customers experience a brand. The visual elements are often the first point of contact between a brand and a potential customer. Well-executed design can evoke emotions and create a positive perception of a brand, which in turn influences customer behavior. For example, a brand‚Äôs website design or its product packaging can make the customer feel welcomed, valued, and even excited.



   The emotional connection that graphic design fosters is particularly important for building long-term brand loyalty. When customers feel connected to a brand on an emotional level, they are more likely to become repeat buyers and advocates for the brand.



6. \*\*Adapting Design for Multiple Platforms:\*\*



   In today‚Äôs digital age, brands must maintain a consistent visual identity across a variety of platforms, from websites and social media to print and outdoor advertising. Graphic design ensures that a brand's identity is adaptable and cohesive across all these touchpoints. Whether a brand is marketing online, offline, or through mobile apps, its graphic design elements must be flexible yet consistent enough to maintain its identity.



   A company like Starbucks achieves this by maintaining a consistent visual presence through its use of green, its clean logo design, and its signature style across various mediums‚Äîwhether on coffee cups, online ads, or retail displays. This visual consistency reinforces brand recognition, no matter where the customer encounters it.



7. \*\*Effective Communication of Information:\*\*



   Graphic design isn‚Äôt just about making things look attractive; it‚Äôs also about effective communication. A well-designed piece can make complex information easy to understand and digest. This is particularly true in industries like technology, healthcare, and finance, where graphic design plays a crucial role in simplifying complicated processes, statistics, or data for consumers.



   For instance, infographics are often used in marketing materials to convey a large amount of data or statistics in a visually engaging way. By using the right combination of color, typography, and imagery, graphic design helps to break down barriers and make information more accessible.



\#### Conclusion



Graphic design is an integral part of branding that goes beyond making a business look good. It is a powerful tool for building brand identity, communicating messages, and fostering customer loyalty. By creating a distinct and visually cohesive presence, companies can differentiate themselves in the market, establish emotional connections with their customers, and ultimately drive business success.



Through strategic design choices such as logos, color schemes, typography, and imagery, businesses can communicate their values, mission, and unique selling proposition effectively. In a marketplace where consumer attention is fleeting, a well-designed brand is one that stands out, makes a lasting impression, and forms a meaningful relationship with its audience.



As companies continue to recognize the importance of visual storytelling, the role of graphic design in shaping brand identity becomes more critical. In a world where first impressions matter, a strong visual identity can be the difference between a brand that‚Äôs forgotten and one that‚Äôs unforgettable.

So, this happened yesterday, and I'm cringing just writing it out, but maybe sharing will help me feel less like an idiot.

I was at this popular daytime bar that closes at 6pm. It was around 2pm, and I was just chilling, watching some TV when I noticed two girls sitting at a table nearby. One of them caught my eye‚Äîshe was super attractive, so I decided to shoot my shot.

I walked over, started some small talk, and it actually seemed to be going alright. We were chatting about random stuff, they asked my name, I asked theirs, then we talked about what we did for a living. I even threw in a joke because it turns out one of them was 17, and I'm 21. I laughed and said, ""What are you guys doing here at a bar? Must be breaking the law or something‚Äîshould I call the cops?"" They both laughed, so I thought things were going well.

Then I went for it‚ÄîI told the attractive one I‚Äôd love to take her out for coffee sometime. And then she hit me with the classic, ""I have a boyfriend."" In front of her friend. Ouch.

I know rejection is just part of the game, but man, it really sucks when you put yourself out there, try to be confident, and still get turned down. Now I‚Äôm over here feeling awful, replaying everything in my head and wondering if I could have just avoided the whole thing by not going up to them in the first place. 

Has anyone else had something like this happen? How do you deal with rejection like this without it just feeling... brutal?

My last post here :) but my dms are always open to those who need help in any stuff regarding step1.
I know I should‚Äôve posted it last Wednesday when i got the P but i was ill and im not fully recovered but i cant get this any late! So i will start off by thanking you all in this sub, couldn‚Äôt have come to this point without your support. One thing i would want to put down clear to you guys is that the scores here can be very low and very high sometimes and they really mess up us, so keep it in between for yourself, if you‚Äôre nbme tells you to trust yourself if you cross above 67% then you need to go with it, i would not ever be prepared or ask you to go to the exam with a low score and expect miracles to happen either, always keep in mind that a constant 3 scores of 68 or 70s in your nbmes is actually promising and you need to trust that. 
I started my preparation at the end of may, and in july is where i worked really hard and completed a 100% uworld. That is where i knew i didn‚Äôt need to go through passes of it so i started my nbmes and the usual. You may not score really well on your first nbme but whatever you get , work it out and focus on your weak areas and work on it and move to the next one. One thing i did was that i would always make a document for the nbme incorrects/ important points which i would revise.(really helpful especially in your last week of exam). 
All those early in prep, UW is a learning tool, you‚Äôre supposed to score in 30s/50s etc , that‚Äôs totally alright. What you need to understand are the concepts. Remember its a learning tool even till you complete it to a 100%. 
I did Bnbs with my school modules but i never really used them again, same goes for sketchy, although i did try to incorporate anki but I couldn‚Äôt. Had to choose between practising questions.
Dirty medicine is gold if you‚Äôre weak in certain areas, Dr randy neil is legit the best, not only for biostats but for biochemistry, general pharma stuff. Love that man! 
The most important/ King Mehlman! I did his pdfs (neuroanatomy, arrows, risk factors, biochemistry and msk) and then i found out his audio qbank on YouTube which i wish i had found earlier! The way this guy teaches is gold, literally saw a sharp score increase after his videos, he teaches you how to tackle really tough questions and thats what the real deal is about nowadays. 
I did ethics from the conrad fischer 100 cases ethics and i would 100% recommend that book if youre struggling just like me, but only if you‚Äôre early in your prep or may be a month or two out cuz thats a bit extensive book! 
Nbmes, i did some random from 22-25  and 26-31 properly. Timed and make sure you dont lie to yourself, please! Its okay to score less now than to cry for an entire yearüòÖ 
Nbme26 and 27 (68%) end of july
Nbme28- 64% ( august)
Nbme 29- 70%
Nbme 30- 73%
Nbme31- 68% ( this broke my heart but it made me work even harder)
Old free120- 77% (august 16- wanted to be sure to book the dateüòÇ)
New free 120- 72%( October 1)
Real deal October 7 (Pass)
Last week: This was one of the toughest time because i had alot to study and revise but I couldn‚Äôt help maintain my last minute consistency that i had been holding on for months. I made sure i watch dirty medicine ethics video, communication video, patient safety. Did general pathology(esp cancer risk factors, disease markers, genes/tumour suppressors)and pharmacology from FA. Risk factors and arrows mehlman pdfs. And the nbme incorrects i made, I didn‚Äôt have time for everything so I prioritised nbme31 and the free120.
Exam day: one thing i would suggest is never travel for the exam centre the exam day , did that and regretted it. Try to sleep well, didn‚Äôt sleep for more than 2 hours and i dragged myself to the cubicle half asleep even after washing my face in every break. Took a few protein bars and coffee‚Äôs to keep me through the day! The exam question stems weren‚Äôt long ass, consisted of a mixture between 1-2 liners of nbmes to maximum of the free120. The question asking style was exactly that of free120 for me. Everyone has a different form, some of my friends we‚Äôre arguing the exam was like the nbmes and to some uworld etc but what you can take out of this is that if you‚Äôve worked hard, no matter how the exam is ,you‚Äôll do well. For me the questions were hard and i was disappointed because the exam content was not followed and some subjects which we‚Äôre supposedly high yield only had a question or two. The exam is heavy on ethics yes! But they are not very hard, a good practice can help you alot! Remember, trust in your nbmes and go with your first answer. You will pass!

1gkpd85,https://i.redd.it/n3coso89c7zd1.jpeg,Pump not running when machine is warm (Lelit 41TEMD),"Hi all,

I am having issues with my Lelit 41TEMD.
It‚Äôs about 3 years old now. Has been a great machine thus far.

Morning coffee is fine, warm the machine up for 5-10mins and then pours a shot fine.

But then say if I turn it back on an hour or so later, it heats up fine, but the pump will not run when I flick the switch to pour a shot.

It kinda feels like it‚Äôs too hot (even though it‚Äôs been an hour or more for it to cool down).
I then need to wait anywhere between 30mins to an hour and a half with the machine off, then to turn it back on and then the pump will run (obviously waiting for it to warm up).

Very frustrating, is there something that it could easily be that I can consider to fix?

If I take it back to the place I bought it from, their servicing starts at $350 and I would obviously prefer to fix it myself if I can!

Thanks in advance.",1,1730864316.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1gkpaqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/1gkpaqh/my_marriage_is_hanging_on_by_a_thread/,My marriage is hanging on by a thread,"We have a 18 m/o daughter. Over the course of her life my husband has been becoming more and more unhappy in his relationship with me due to my parenting style. When we are in a good place he objectively praises my parenting style and says I am a good mother but personally he doesn‚Äôt think so.

I have been parenting in a way that is natural to me, we co-sleep; with my daughter and I in the main bedroom and my husband in the guest room. We started this around 4 m/o to get through the hard times then became too comfortable and haven‚Äôt made changes. At this stage I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd sleep if I was away from her. I am wanting to set up a floor bed in her bedroom for her as the next step of separation to get my husband and I back into our bed together, even if for some of the night.

I respond to my daughter‚Äôs cries and prioritise her above everything else, of course. My husband works extremely hard for our family and life. He tells me he doesn‚Äôt feel loved, he criticises me and tells me I am a bad wife and parent. That he gives and I just take. That I don‚Äôt care about him - but I barely have time to care for myself. When my daughter naps I prioritise rest - that‚Äôs the most self care I get. I do small things through out the day to care for him like make his coffee, get his lunch ready, make ‚Äúhis‚Äù bed. 

I have tried to initiate dates to try and connect and he always wants our daughter involved which is sweet but defeats the purpose. We haven‚Äôt been intimate in a very long time (I‚Äôm too embarrassed to say how long.) I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt even find me attractive anymore.

We are broken and so deeply unhappy. He is unhappy due to all of the reasons I‚Äôve listed and I‚Äôm unhappy because I feel constantly criticised when I‚Äôm just trying to be the best mother I can to my daughter. 

He has begged me to change my attachment parenting style but I genuinely do not know how I am supposed to change - how ironic would it be if he and I were to separate - which would then create separation between my daughter and I.

- Thinking of a smaller-sized storage ottoman to open up the space. The current coffee table is not working for us.

- Any suggestions for cozier window coverings?

- I‚Äôd like to update the throw pillows, art, blankets, etc., but I get overwhelmed by the number of options. What can I replace or add? What size art would look best on the wall behind the floor lamp?

- Any tips on styling the mantle without making it feel too cluttered? The TV is mounted over the fireplace (I know, I know!), but it has to stay there.

Budget-wise, I‚Äôm flexible. The sofa and fireplace are staying as-is, but everything else is fair game (diaper changing station is temporary).",1,1730863444.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False
1gkp2kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1gkp2kl/prediction_pittsburgh_penguins_vs_new_york/,Prediction: Pittsburgh Penguins VS New York Islanders 2024-11-05 19,"Ah, the Penguins versus the Islanders, a classic matchup that promises to be as thrilling as watching paint dry. On one side, we have the Penguins, who are riding a two-game winning streak like it's the Stanley Cup Finals. On the other, the Islanders, who are struggling to score goals like they're allergic to the back of the net. 

The Penguins are bringing their dynamic duo, Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby, to the party, hoping they'll be enough to overcome the absence of Bryan Rust, who is apparently on an extended vacation from the ice. Meanwhile, the Islanders' offense is ranked 31st in scoring, which is just a fancy way of saying they're really, really bad at putting the puck in the net. Their power play is ranked 29th, which is like saying they're slightly better at failing with an extra man on the ice.

The odds are as exciting as a lukewarm cup of coffee, with the Islanders priced at 1.68 on FanDuel and the Penguins at 2.16. Other sportsbooks have the odds slightly more balanced, but let's be honest, this game could go either way. Given that underdogs win about 41% of the time in hockey, the Penguins at 2.16 look like a decent bet, especially considering their recent form and the Islanders' scoring woes.

So, my best bet? Take the Penguins to win and maybe throw in a wager on the under, because with the Islanders' offense, goals might be as rare as a unicorn sighting. And if you're feeling particularly adventurous, maybe bet on Crosby to score, because someone has to, right?",1,1730863284.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Chikn idly munched on some chicken nuggets as he watched cheesy rom coms. It was the only thing quelling the burning within him and existential crisis he was suffering through. He hadn‚Äôt gone outside in two days, preferring to find something to distract himself. He had considered meeting up with his friends, but after the‚Ä¶ unpleasantness, he wanted to wait a few days until everyone‚Äôs had cooler heads.

He had hoped Wipped Cweam would visit, but she simply‚Ä¶ hadn‚Äôt. A part of him was scared he had scared her away, but another part reminded himself she was excited when she learned of his nature and wouldn‚Äôt leave him. But, she might even just been doing that to be polite...

He fumbled and dropped a chicken nugget, Chikn sighing at his clumsiness. He lowered himself and looked under the couch, reaching around and stopped when he felt plastic. He pulled his hand back and gasped in surprise when he saw it was his phone. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I checked the couch. I know I did.‚Äù

Chikn stared down at his couch for a long moment, feeling like he was going insane. Was he blind? Was he stupid? Was this real? Did he actually check under his couch, or had he imagined it? There was no way he could‚Äôve missed it if it was there the whole time. 

Chikn was growing anxious as he stared down at the nugget case, unsure why he couldn‚Äôt find his phone before and whether he should be worried about it.

‚ÄúSurprise!‚Äù Chikn yelped when a white blur barreled into him, wrapping him in a tight hug and pulling him from his thoughts. ‚ÄúMiss me?‚Äù

Chikn smirked, previous anxiety regarding his phone gone, and reversed their positions, eliciting a surprised yelp from Wipped. ‚ÄúOf course I have, where‚Äôve you been?‚Äù He asked as his tail wagged happily.

‚ÄúSorry, Chiky.‚Äù Chikn pulled away from the hug which allowed Wipped to sit up. ‚ÄúHad to deal with dumb work stuff. Gotta pay the bills, you know?‚Äù 

Chikn hummed in response, turning to look at his door as he stood up. ‚ÄúHow did you get in? You didn‚Äôt pick the lock, did you?‚Äù He eyed her suspiciously.

Wipped scoffed and crossed her arms in mock outrage. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have you know that I found your spare key and used it to let me in.‚Äù She stood up and handed Chikns key back to him. ‚ÄúYou should hide that better, I could‚Äôve been a serial killer you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? And kill me? No one would harm me, I‚Äôm too cute and lovely.‚Äù Chikn said as he made himself look impossibly cute, his eyes widening to an absurd size and sparkling before he lolled out his tongue like a ditz.

Wipped put a hand to her mouth and laughed, snorting in between laughs. 

Chikn looked surprised and returned to normal, tilting his head at her as she continued to laugh. ‚ÄúYou snort when you laugh."" He observed..‚Äù

Wipped managed to get her laughing fit under control and met Chikns gaze. ‚ÄúYeah, sorry. Lifelong curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI disagree, it‚Äôs kinda‚Ä¶ cute.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh! Uh, t-thanks.‚Äù Wipped cleared her throat and looked away to hide her blush. ‚ÄúS-so, have you been ok without me? I felt terrible leaving you alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúMostly, just keeping my mind off things.‚Äù Chikn showed his phone to her. ‚ÄúI did just find my phone, so I won‚Äôt have to replace it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYay! Where‚Äôd you find it?‚Äù Wipped gently took it from Chikns paws and looked it over. ‚ÄúCute case.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnder my couch, weirdly enough. I know I checked there *multiple* times, but I found it right before you attacked me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh, weird.‚Äù She handed the phone back to him. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs because of your magic?‚Äù

Chikns eyes widened as though the thought just now occurred to him. ‚ÄúMaybe. I was wondering if it had grown legs and walked away again. Not sure why it wouldn‚Äôt have appeared earlier though.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh, I‚Äôm sure magics fickle.‚Äù She reached over and ruffled his head. ‚ÄúAnd I can tell things slip your mind a lot.‚Äù

He smiled and whacked her hand away, smoothing out his fur. ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm not an impulsive criminal.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing an impulsive criminal is fun, you should try it sometime.‚Äù Wipped said proudly as she folded her hands behind her back, closed her eyes, and puffed out her chest  a cocky smile on her face. ""That way you're not always such a goody two shoes.""

‚ÄúYeah, tell it to the cops.‚Äù He challenged before sitting back down. ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm going to charge this up. Wanna hang for a bit?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot particularly, hangings such a pain in the neck. But I *would* like to spend some time with you.‚Äù She joked, earning an eye roll from Chikn.

‚ÄúHardy har, you‚Äôre hilarious. How about you make some popcorn and I‚Äôll find something for us to watch?‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it, boss man.‚Äù She saluted and began walking to the kitchen. ""You *better* have extra butter popcorn.‚Äù

Chikn didn't answer and picked up his remote, stopping smalls tars were accompanies by a small jingle and Bezel appeared over a Chikns coffee table. *‚ÄúBezel?‚Äù* Chikn said with shock.

Wipped swiveled around and yelped in fright at the brightly colored sexyman with a clock for a head floating a few feet from her. ‚ÄúGhost!‚Äù She cried out and began throwing anything she could reach at him. ‚ÄúGo away or we‚Äôll kill you twice!‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease stop, you‚Äôre only embarrassing yourself.‚Äù Bezel said, completely unaffected by her assault. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a *ghost,* I find such a comparison offensive.‚Äù 

Wipped had run out of objects to throw and flattened herself against the wall, keeping her eyes on the swxy ghost at all times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù Chikn said reassuringly as he walked up to her, gently placing a paw on her shoulder. ‚ÄúHe won't hurt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? But he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ is this one of your weird wizard friends, Chiky?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Bezel,‚Äù He placed a hand to his chest and raised his other hand high above his head. ‚ÄúEmbodiment of time.‚Äù He said with a slight bow.

Wipped merely looked confused, her eyes darting around. ‚ÄúChiky?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you here, Bezel?‚Äù Chikn asked, getting in front of Wipped.

‚ÄúI came to warn you, both of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWarn us?‚Äù Wipped shared a look with Chikn. ‚ÄúWarn us about what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are in grave danger.‚Äù Bezel looked to Wipped. ‚ÄúLucifer is planning to kill you. You need to stay vigilant and pray against her until The Heavens notice and send the Choirs after her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait Wait Wait, Lucifer? As in‚Ä¶ the Devil?‚Äù Wipped asked anxiously. 

‚ÄúPrecisely.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, that means Christianity is real?‚Äù She frowned, perhaps upset to have her faith vindicated. 

‚ÄúIn broad strokes, no religion in the cosmos has everything right.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ a-and she wants to *k-kill* me?‚Äù Wipped began to shake furiously but calmed down a little when Chikn wrapped her in a hug. 

‚ÄúWhy? Why would Lucifer want to hurt Wipped?‚Äù Chikn demanded, a slight growl in his throat.

Bezel was quiet for a long moment, trying to formulate a response. ‚ÄúShe wants to make you sad to get back at Fwench Fwy. Being an angel, Lucifer will find any way to inconvenience or hurt them, even at the expense of an innocent.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre friends with an *angel?*‚Äù Wipped said with some wonderment.

‚ÄúAnd a demon, but they‚Äôve mellowed out.‚Äù Chikn said casually despite Wipped recoiling at his words, Chikn turning back to Bezel. ‚ÄúDo you know anything else? Anything that might help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid not, I just learned that she wants to kill your little cat friend and I knew I needed to warn the two of you.‚Äù He leaned in close to Chikn. ‚ÄúBe vigilant and make sure to use your powers, Chikn. She could be anywhere and strike at any time.‚Äù

Wipped yelped in fright and buried her face in Chikns shoulder. ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù He turned to Wipped and gently stroked the back of her head. ‚ÄúThank you for warning us, Bezel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can thank me by telling Fwench Fwy of my good deed when you go to visit them.‚Äù He pulled away and floated higher. ‚ÄúCiao.‚Äù

Bezel disappeared in a flurry of stars, leaving Chikn and Wipped alone.  ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm scared, Chikn.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre ok.‚Äù Chikn squeezed her tighter. ‚ÄúBezels suspicious and untrustworthy, I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs telling the truth. He might be trying to scare you away or mess with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúB-but what if he *is?* What if the D-Devil herself is after me? God hasn‚Äôt answered e-even the *simplest* of m-my prayers, why would he p-protect me now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go to Fwench Fwy and see what they say. Afterwards, we‚Äôre going to move everything you want out of your house and move it here.‚Äù

Wipped pulled away and looked surprised. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to stay with me for however long you want.‚Äù He offered with a kind smile. ‚ÄúThink of it as an extended sleepover.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ oh, Chiky I‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs so...‚Äù She cleared her throat. ‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôll feel a lot safer having a wizard nearby.‚Äù She said with a warm smile. ‚ÄúCan you do anything to protect your house?‚Äù

Chikn hummed in thought and he scratched his head. ‚ÄúI can make a barrier around my house that only allows people I want past it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it can‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù Wipped had calmed down considerably, looking around at what would be her home for the time being. ‚ÄúShould we go and meet with your angel friend? I‚Ä¶ kinda want to ask them some questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Chikn took her by the hand and led her out of his house. ‚ÄúJust follow me.‚Äù

Wipped obliged and followed him out the door and to the street. She turned back to stare at Chikns house, her smile growing wider.

                                   ----------------
 
Fwench Fwy nervously dialed Iscreams number and put the phone to their ear,  fidgeting nervously as the phone rang and predictably went to voicemail. *‚ÄúWhaaat? You called little ol‚Äô me? I‚Äôm flattered! I‚Äôm performing the dark arts right now or communing with entities from the Immortal Pit, but leave a message and I‚Äôll probably get back to you when I feel like it. Maybe.‚Äù* There was a beep and Fwench Fwy opened their mouth to speak. *‚ÄúHa! Got you, idiot!‚Äù* 

Fwench Fwy frowned in annoyance and waited for the real beep before they started talking. ‚ÄúHey Forneus, I‚Ä¶ I know you probably need some space right now, but I just wanted to let you know that‚Ä¶ that I care about you. Take as much time as you need, I can wait, and when you‚Äôre ready, we‚Äôll talk things out, ok? I‚Äôll accept whatever you decide, even‚Ä¶ even if you want to break up. I‚Ä¶‚Äù Fwench Fwy was silent for a long moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù 

They pulled their phone away and ended the call, throwing it to the side. Fwench Fwy closed their eyes and cupped their hands in prayer, only to be interrupted by a knock at the door. They jumped up and ran to the door, hoping Iscream had returned.

‚ÄúForneus, I just want to say- ‚Äù They threw the door open and stopped when they saw Chikn and Wipped Cweam standing at the threshold. ‚ÄúOh! Chikn, what a surprise.‚Äù They turned to Wipped Cweam who offered a small wave. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúH-hi, I‚Äôm Wipped Cweam, Chikns new friend.‚Äù She gave an awkward smile. ‚ÄúAre you really an angel?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Yes I am.‚Äù Fwench Fwy pepped up and smiled back. ‚ÄúI see Chikns caught you up to speed. Were you perhaps hoping for spiritual guidance?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe later, Fwy. We need your help.‚Äù Chikn interjected. 

‚ÄúHelp? Well, then please, come in‚Äù Fwench Fwy moved out of the way, her guests walking past them and into the house as Fwench Fwy closed the door. They all made their way to the living room and sat down at the couch. ‚ÄúNow, what seems to be the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù Wipped cleared her throat. ‚ÄúMe and Chikn were met by a weird clock guy earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúBezel.‚Äù Fwench Fwy spat as their frown lengthened. ‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe tried to warn us.‚Äù Chikn explained. ‚ÄúHe said that Lucifer was trying to kill Wipped Cweam to get back at you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLucifer?‚Äù Fwench Fwys widened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous, Lucifer‚Äôs been missing for ages, and she certainly wouldn‚Äôt waste her time on us. How would he even have gotten this information anywhow?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut What if its *true?* W-will I go to hell if the s-she kills me?‚Äù Wipped began to shake in fear, causing Chikn to placea hand on her thigh. 

‚ÄúNo! Of course not, a Reaper leads you to judgment, no one can take you where you don‚Äôt belong.‚Äù

Wipped did calm down at that, but she looked away and fidgeted with her hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not exactly the best person. W-what If Hell is where I b-belong?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you hurt people?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got into a stupid fight the other day.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I meant. I‚Äôm asking if you commit evil acts and hurt others. Like, have you murdered someone? Are you abusive to loved ones or strangers? Have you hurt a partner by cheating?‚Äù 

Wipped was quiet as she thought it over. ‚ÄúNo, but I do sometimes regret how things ended with my family.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Clockm- Er, God, doesn‚Äôt expect you to be perfect. Only truly wicked people go to hell, like murderous dictators, and somwthing tells me youre not a murderous dictator.‚Äù She placed a hand on Wippeds shoulder and gave a comforting smile. ‚ÄúAt worst, you‚Äôd go to Purgatory to work through your problems before eventually coming up to Heaven.‚Äù

Wipped breathed a small sigh of relief. ‚ÄúThanks, that does make me feel a little better... but I'd still rather not die before my time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, is there anything we can do?‚Äù Chikn inquired. ""Just in case.""

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything to Bezel's story, he‚Äôs just trying to get under our skin and scare Wipped away. But, if it‚Äôll make you feel safer, pray for protection, be vigilant, and set up a lot of holy symbols and rituals in your home. It also doesn‚Äôt hurt to carry holy water and wear a cross.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, is there, like, a book? I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

Fwench Fwy nodded and handed them a leather bound tome with a white cross emblazoned across it. ‚ÄúThis is an in depth guide I made for exorcisms and protection against demonic entities. It‚Äôll protect you from even the Princes of Hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, this is perfect.‚Äù Chikn said as he rifled through the pages. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs anything to Bezel's warning, we‚Äôll be prepared.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich there probably isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with‚Ä¶ him.‚Äù Fwench Fey grumbled. ‚ÄúNow, is there anything else you two need?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôll be it.‚Äù Wipped said, seming to be in better spirits. ‚ÄúCome on Chiky.‚Äù She and Chikn stood up, Wipped following after him.

She stopped at the threshold of the living room and turned around. ‚ÄúUh, Fwench Fwy?"" Fwench Fwy turned and gave Wipped their full attention. ""I‚Ä¶ I pray a lot, every night in fact, and I was wondering‚Ä¶ why doesn‚Äôt He answer?‚Äù

Fwench Fwy frowned and took a moment to answer. ‚ÄúI wish i could tell you, but im afraid I don‚Äôt have the answers you seek. Your relationship with Him is personal, and there‚Äôs only so much I can do to help you. But just know that he *is* listening, and if you tune out the rest of the world, you‚Äôll hear him in your own way eventually.‚Äù

Wipped stared at Fwench Fwy with an unreadable expression and turned around, walking out the door.

When Fwench Fwy was alone, they let out a whimper and their posture buckled. They took out their phone and, rather pathetically, checked to see if Iscream had called back. They of course hadn‚Äôt, and Fwench Fwy threw the phone away, resting their elbows on their knees and placing their head in their hands. ",1,1730863229.0,ChiknNuggit,1,1.0,False

1gkp05m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1gkp05m/regarding_assistants_in_rooms/,Regarding Assistants in Rooms,"Was reading the thread about Hollywood assistants disappearing, and I wanted to make a new thread because it seems like there is still a lot of general misunderstanding about the jobs these people do.

In a normally functioning writers‚Äô room, there are 4 types of assistants (aka Support Staff).

1. Writers‚Äô Assistant ‚Äî This person has the hardest job in the room (in my opinion). While the room is in session, they keep the record of what‚Äôs discussed, ideas pitched, joke suggestions, etc. Imagine a court stenographer. It‚Äôs very demanding. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see WAs who have developed carpal tunnel (if they‚Äôve done it for a while). After the room ends for the day, the WA synthesizes their notes and organizes them into a readable format before sending the document out to the writers. Every day. These documents can be 20+ pages pretty easily. This means that WAs typically work for hours after the room ends for the day. In addition, they‚Äôre kind of regarded as the show ‚Äúexpert‚Äù as far as organizing information, so in the room they may be asked questions at any time and be expected to answer quickly. ‚ÄúHey, what was that pitch we had for Adam‚Äôs character in 305?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat episode did we start tracking Kate‚Äôs illness?‚Äù Etc. It‚Äôs tough. The benefit to this job is that they are in the room ALL THE TIME and usually have opportunities to pitch. They are also usually (but not always) the first in line out of the assistants to write or co-write an episode.

2. Script Coordinator ‚Äî Many people don‚Äôt know how many iterations a single episode script goes through as it jumps through the hoops of its producers, studio, and network. It‚Äôs a lot. This is where the SC comes in. They are Final Draft experts (or should be) who proof every outline and script draft that comes through. Then they distribute it to the applicable people with watermarks. Since the script is technically IP, there are very strict rules on how it is distributed and they are tracked. If a show is in its first season, they may also send scripts to people being interviewed for department head positions (i.e. production designer, wardrobe, etc). There‚Äôs hundreds of people on a film set, and this person is responsible for making sure all of them have the script when they need. It‚Äôs also a hard job because they are not writing the scripts, so they may often have to wait around until the middle of the night when the showrunner finishes the script and gives them the go ahead to send it off. The SC may or may not be in the room. Some even work remote. I have friends that have been able to co-write episodes as a SC, but it‚Äôs less often than WA.

3. Writers‚Äô PA ‚Äî This is the role I would say is most like what people would expect of a traditional assistant. Overall, the job is to just make sure the office/room is functioning in an efficient way and that the writers have all their basic needs met to allow them to focus on the writing. This means: gathering lunch orders and picking up lunch, shopping for and stocking food in the kitchen and drinks in the fridge, making coffee, and making sure things are tidy. The good PAs will know the writers well enough to anticipate their tastes and preferences before they are even asked. The PA is also the person who will communicate with the building manager if there is a problem with the temperature, or parking spots, etc. This is also the position that gets asked to do a lot of random tasks, like hanging photos up on walls, helping people fix their computers, and buying office supplies. Never seen a WPA get asked to write a script. This is also a position that got basically eliminated when rooms went to Zoom. Now that rooms are more and more in person, they are coming back.

4. Showrunner‚Äôs Assistant ‚Äî This job kind of depends on the showrunner, but the main responsibilities are setting calendars, taking notes on calls. In general, there are a lot of people trying to contact the showrunner, and the SR assistant is who all of that is funneled through. The SR assistant may or not be in the room, but I have known some to be given episode co-writes.

That‚Äôs basically it. Source: I‚Äôve had experience as support staff. 

Hope this is helpful. If anything isn‚Äôt clear or you have questions feel free to ask!

1gkosii,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1gkosii/with_2_months_left_in_2024_how_is_the_year_for/,"With 2 months left in 2024, how is the year for you so far?","Kumustahan lang muna. How's 2024 so far for you guys? Anu-ano ba ang mga naging ganap, karanasan ngayong taon? And what's in store for us for the remainder of the year?

Long story/post ahead...let me start. For me, di ko masabi if bad start or oks lang. Kaka-resign ko lang sa 1st job ko by end of November last year after working there for 2 years, so started the year unemployed. Kasabay niyan ay na-stroke daddy ko, and before last Christmas ay kakalabas lang din niya sa confinement sa ospital. So habang wala pang work ay sinamahan muna namin nina mommy si daddy sa condo unit ng tita ko na pansamantalang tuluyan niya habang nagpapaigi, which is malapit lang sa ospital kung saan siya nagre-rehab for several months. Maganda naging umpisa ng road to recovery niya, though bumagal kinalaunan, may progress pa rin. Fast forward to now, he's way better than before, not yet perfect pero eventually would get there hopefully bago matapos ang taon or early next year.

When it comes to my hobbies or hilig kong gawin, I'm still a gamer. Hilig pa rin sa Mobile Legends. Pero started playing Genshin Impact na rin (nabawasan ML time minsan dahil rito hehe). And started joining here sa Reddit as well, browsing random posts as well as posting whatever is on my mind. Tamang laro lang maghapon habang wala pang work. Nabawasan din hanggang sa di na nakakalaro minsan nung nagkawork na.

Sa career naman at job hunt, sa dami ng applications na-interview sa isang upscale coffee shop but wasn't shortlisted. And after 5 months of being unemployed ay natanggap na rin sa isang Singaporean concept cafe/resto, nagtraining sa Ortigas area bago supposedly ma-assign sa Antipolo branch na soon-to-open back then. But it was cut short after 1 1/2 months due to a health issue, even though na-clear naman, pero partly dahil na rin sa performance which my fitness level ay naging factor din I was eventually let go. Sa medical exam all goods except sa xray, sabi may pulmonary findings daw, but it turns out ay maling xray and was allegedly switched, and after sputum test and aa repeat xray ay cleared naman pala ako at nakapag-pulmo clearance din kalaunan. Pero parang balewala rin kasi tinanggal pa rin due to that, as if they accepted na may pulmo problem ako kahit cleared na, though again may kulang rin naman sa performance. Maraming nagastos dito from medical exam to requirements including trainee uniforms pati gamot na supposedly for my pulmo condition (good thing may ninang ako na nakatulong sa akin in case totoo palang may sakit ako) na wala naman pala, pati pamasahe at pangkain as I accomplish all those. Sayang ok din sahod at may incentives pa naman. Pero thank God pa rin na wala akong sakit, or else things would get complicated.

After that it's decided na I work on my fitness. Pero umpisa pa lang ng taon habang wala pang work ay sinimulan ko na sa regular na walking exercise. And after leaving my 2nd job ay nagstart na uli sa gym with at least a 6 month contract, na eventually tatapusin ko and maybe extend for another month or 2 next year. Kahit may 3rd job na ako noon ay sinisikap kong makapag-workout bago duty. Started around at least 107kg, now currently nasa 90-91kg na, aiming to go down at around 75kg by year end. Since walang budget for healthier foods, normal kain lang ako, pero I try to control intake as much as makakaya.

Shortly after mawala sa 2nd job ay natanggap naman agad sa 3rd job, bilang store 7crew sa isang dessert shop. Less physically demanding ang work so kinakaya pa rin mag-gym kahit may pasok. Ok din naman sahod and recently lang nagtaas. Though need to be flexible na maassign sa iba-ibang branches, meaning hindi lang sa Antipolo pero nahihiram din sa Marikina pati rin na-rotate sa Cubao. Medj hassle sa biyahe and might have been a factor to consider resigning. Pero despite given my 4 months time and kahit ginagawa ko naman best ko sa work, medj kulang pa performance ko so I was let go, though an employee checklist being imposed na wala naman dati ay naging issue rin, which can somewhat add to the pressure sa mga baguhan na need matutunan lahat at maging pulido, isama na pag natapat na medj strikto o prangka ang kasama (if not at kung walang checklist baka nakalusot pa). As I was being ready to face holiday season work, by day-off after Undas long weekend ay natanggap ko ung memo. Ayun, mukhang pahinga muna sa Pasko. Nakakabigla na all of a sudden di na pala ako gigising nang maaga at bibiyahe sa work.

Sa family, it looks like may issue rin. Una sa ate kong kinasal last year na di ko maintindihan if mas priority o gusto ang asawa na lang pakisamahan, supposedly sila minsan ang sasama kay daddy pero biglang dina sumisipot, not even communication with me or maybe kahit sinong pinsan o kamag-anak. Ma-pride so when it seems na hindi siya pinasalamatan ay nagreact daw siya negatively, as if gusto niya ma-recognize ang help niya for daddy. So no choice kundi si mommy ang sasama kay daddy lalo na kung may work ako noon. Pero dahil di rin nagkakasundo at na-trigger rin ang anxiety disorder with manic episodes ni mommy due to stress na rin, biglang nagdesisyon siya na ipaiwan sa tita ko at need din magpahinga to manage her condition. Not even my father's side relatives can understand ano pinagdaanan niya, basta inisip na lang nila ay parang as if inabandona si daddy, so mommy's not in good terms with them for the meantime. So don't expect na makakasama sa family gatherings sa father's side dahil doon. Hopefully hindi mahantong sa hiwalayan. Medj ok pa naman sila daddy and mommy sa ngayon, all goods nung nagkita kaming tatlo. Hope na maayos din eventually, especially if ready na si mommy na mag-sorry, it's up to her. Despite all these, it seems na nakakaraos pa rin ako and even mommy, pati daddy nakakaraos din despite the current set-up na physically hiwalay muna (pero ok pa rin ugnayan).

Despite that there were still good things to look forward to. Had a simple VaLENTine's celebration with fam, spent Holy Week with lola and some relatives, nakasama sa summer outing sa Bataan, kasal ng isang pinsan, and of course the holidays to look forward to. Despite terminations and rejections sa work, may added experience na rin that I could add sa resume and sana maibaon sa susunod. Also had a fair share of discovering new places and eats and iba-ibang bagay.

Overall, 2024 had it's ups and downs. And at this point medj down dahil nawalan nga ng work plus sapat na ang pera for only a few months, as I expect to be jobless for 2-3 months minimum since pahinga muna sa Pasko. Pero hoping na makaraos sa natitira ng taon hanggang next year. Definitely not the best year for me, yet hoping for a good ending and for a better year sa 2025.

Not sure if I better make this post as a year ender pero napaaga ata, but I feel like sharing my thoughts about how 2024 went for me so far...

So what now? What's in store for the remainder of the year? Though not a bad idea to start applying for jobs this month, pero I'm more inclined towards resting through the holidays at i-enjoy muna, tskaa na job hunt next year. Will consider applying for civil service na rin for possible government work as backup plan. Taken into consideration ung natitira kong pera galing sa savings at sa makukuhang sahod tsaka final pay, hopefully would last until around 1st qtr ng next year. Taken into consideration din ung bayad sa gym for at least another month or 2 pati pamasahe as well as pangkain especially if kaya pa rin lumabas, might still be able to treat mommy and daddy sa kanilang mga birthday kahit simple lang tsaka regalo kay lola sa Pasko, but other than that di na kaya gumastos masyado, need to save up for the coming months lalo na panggastos sa job hunting and requirements if may tumanggap na sa kin. As much as possible di gagalawin ung natitirang investment, last resort na lang un. For the meantime, may time pang maglaro ng games, as well as more importantly focus on getting fit sa gym. Then enjoy Christmas season, and pagkatapos back to square one nga at job hunting na uli.

Bahala na si Lord at ipapaubaya ko na sa kanya. May plano siya para sa bawat isa sa atin, at may rason sya para mangyari ang mga pinagdaanan natin so far. God bless us all for the remainder of 2024! ",2,1730862312.0,CasualPH,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had a few days though of serious gastrointestinal discomfort. First episode was at the airport travelling for work, I felt a bit off, had a coffee, ate some lunch then just felt terribly nauseous and dizzy and like the world was closing in. I found a spot to lie down until it passed. 
Yesterday at a conference I had major bloating all day and the runs (sorry tmi). Today I felt a bit off, got up and went for a long run then stupidly had a sweet pastry for breakfast. An hour later I went downhill fast. Nausea, sweating, clammy, racing heart. So so bloated. Had to catch an Uber back to my hotel and lie down when I need to be working!
This could all be a big yucky combination of jet lag, out of ordinary food with travel, different exercise regime to normal and I‚Äôve had a gastric sleeve so I am easily thrown by diet changes but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the Ritalin is causing this? Has anyone else had similar experiences?

# Background

31M, have been running on and off most of my life, surprised myself a little with a 1:23:29 PB at the Buller Half Marathon in February this year, so decided to give a real training plan a go and try for sub 3 marathon. I am normally a footballer (soccer) so running always takes a back seat, but this winter I took a year off to train for this race in the hope of going sub-3. This was my second marathon and first time doing a structured training plan (albeit Runna app).

Current PRs before the day (according to Strava) are: 18:14 in the 5k, 39:15 in the 10k (acknowledge that could be faster, I just haven't done one), 1:23:29 HM, and 3:12:27 full marathon.

# Training

I did quite a bit of research after Buller HM in Feb and landed on the Runna app as the option that suited me the best for training. I couldn't find a person locally and as far as paying for something virtually, Runna was the right balance of price/engagement. I wouldn't use them again, but I think it was a great option for me at the time as I had very little experience with different types of runs, running plan and managing a training schedule. 

I chose a 16 week marathon plan which started mid-July. Typical 3 week build and a deload week in between peaking at around 74km 4 weeks out, something I have learned is actually pretty low now! Got lucky and had no injuries during the whole block, missing only 1 long run when I got the flu for 4-5 days. For some reason the app classified the Auckland Marathon as a moderate elevation race and so had me doing a hill repeat session almost every week, which, surprisingly, I have grown to love. Found the perfect hill where I live that was long enough and steep enough to withstand the longer 90s reps, such an amazing feeling doing 10-15 hill reps as the sun comes up looking out over the ocean - a great way to start the day.  

Highlights included:

* absolutely cruising through a HM at MP about 2 weeks out which included full walk through of pre-race morning plan.
* Discovering my local track for the interval sessions once a week.
* Of course, my new best friend the hill repeat session.

# Pre-Race

Flew up to Auckland with my partner on the Friday morning and headed straight to the Expo to collect my race pack, this was my first big event so was buzzing after the Expo experience, a lot more freebies than my local events. Spent Friday afternoon and Saturday relaxing and catching up with friends in Auckland, we were staying with some friends in Devonport \~5 mins walk from the start line, something I was very grateful for come race day. I had been so unbelievably nervous in the weeks leading up to this race out of desire to achieve my goal I was surprised to find I slept pretty well on Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday morning was 3:30am wake up for bagels and coffee before watching the PL and relaxing while trying to get the bowels going, a small warm up and walk down to start line around 5:15am. Special mention to my supportive partner who was by my side the whole way and came down with me for the start, didn't even need to do a bag drop this race thanks to her! Hugs with her and my mate who came down to see me off, last dust off of the nerves and down my pre-race gel and I was into the corral. 

# Race

6am gun to kick us off after the wheelies got away at 5;55am. It was an unusual layout at the start line so I ended up probably further forward than I would have otherwise chosen. Because of that my first km was a little slower as I let the 3 hour pack catch up to me. My goal was to stick with the two 3:00 pacers for the first \~25km and then reassess from there. For nutrition I had 5 Pure Nutrition 50g gels that I prefer over the 35g ones as I can get them down easier. 

Kms 1-12 Head down and focus on calming my nerves, slot in at the middle of the 3 hour pack and just try to enjoy it, introduced myself to the pacers and had a small chat, did a lot for my nerves and after that I relaxed a lot. 

Kms 13-21 The group got on to the motorway and down towards the iconic Auckland Harbour Bridge crossing in good time. We faced a serious headwind down this 5km fairly exposed section, the group really tightened up as we all huddled behind the two pacers breaking the wind for us. This section was particularly memorable as I was feeling really good and the experience of running in such a tight pack like that, paired with going over the bridge was pretty epic. Once over we hit downtown Auckland and the crowds began to appear a little more. See my partner at the 22k mark which gives me an awesome feeling! I was about to move away from the group at this point so she gets a great clip of me leading a big pack of runners.

Kms 22-38 This part of the race is really good for me, out towards the Eastern Bays, I make a move away from the 3 hour pack with a young guy doing his first marathon, we run some of my best kms as I'm feeling great and we're just chatting away about our experience so far. At the turnaround \~30km I realise why it had been such easy running and we head back towards town with a bit of a headwind . We join up with a couple of other guys and make a nice pack as we chew up the ks. 

Kms 38-40 Here the race kind of goes sideways for me, I lose the pack I have been running with at about 37 as I can't hold on and they are all still running really well, drop my pace to about 4:30 and start to hold on. Did some quick math to know that I was going to hit my sub-3 goal as long as I keep moving. The headwind really starts to hurt me and even the smallest hill feels like a mountain to overcome. Frantically gulp down my last gel in an attempt to get some life into me and just try to keep putting one foot in front of another. 

At my first marathon 2 years earlier I ran a similar-but-slightly-slower pace but was extremely under-prepared and under-experienced. During that race I fell apart at about 38kms and walked for 6 minutes as I ate the one gel I had with me that came free in my race pack. I thought a lot about that race during this section and gritted my teeth as I knew I was not stopping this time round.

Kms 41 - Finish: Just have to keep moving. Pump the arms. It will all be ok. Focus. Crowd really starts to pull me through this last section. The front 3 hour pacer catches up to me at this point and practically yells in my ear to keep moving. We were going to make it. My timing was slightly off as I ended up doing 42.6 but I still had enough time to go under 3hr. Feel the crowd rouse me for the last few hundred meters despite my legs screaming at me. I turn the corner onto the grass, look up and see the clock. 2:59:10. A wave of emotion hits me. You are going to make it. Andrew the 3 hour guy is right in front of me and waves me forward. Go get your time. Physically, I can barely feel anything at this point but emotionally, I feel everything. Overjoyed, relieved, grateful, immensely proud. I cross the finish line and don't really know what to do, can't stand. can't see. I just wobble over and lie in the shade. I lie there thinking about all the work I have put in, countless early mornings in the cold, clocking up those miles, its all added up to this. Elation. Not sure how long I lie there for. I chat to a nice lady for a few minutes who was running near me for some of the race, we swap times and congratulations, the conversation brings me slowly back to reality and I figure I need to get moving. 

# Post-race

I gingerly walk through the finishers area and sip on some electrolyte drink. See my partner and friends waving at me, can't even wave back, just smile. I move through and meet them out in the open, a big hug from my girlfriend and the tears come. More relief than anything, she knows how much it has meant to me this year. We head off and I buy some post-race Birkenstocks as I've lost one of my toenails and can't roam Auckland CBD barefoot. Breakfast at the ever-fantastic Amano in Britomart for a post race debrief. We spend the rest of the day relaxing and I have a much deserved nap. 

3 days on now and I am looking ahead to the Queenstown marathon in less than 2 weeks, pressure off for that one as I've hit my goal, so a chance for me to enjoy the run. Thinking about what's on the cards for me next, I know I could work on my finish and easily shave a couple more minutes off my time. But equally wondering if the HM distance is better for me for chasing times, and I could focus on doing a couple of Ultras next year.

I had made the executive decision to try more samples than I would normally would think of trying in a month.  I will likely not keep up this trend of trying more and more perfumes each month.  However, I fully intend on trying perfumes each month.

As per usual, I have a star rating system.  If anyone knows of a half star that works in mobile formatting do show me.  Any .5 extra is used as an indicator that it is just a bit more or a bit less of a previous star in terms my experience.  I'll be rating halves in x.5/5 format.

# DSH

The perfumes coming from this brand came in relatively quickly.  I wasn't expecting to review yet 2 more perfumes but I have 2 free samples in with my full size of mango cocktail essence.  Mango cocktail has grown on me.  I love how sour it is.  The undertones of coconut smooth it out nicely as well.  The packaging was bigger than expected.  It started in an envelope when inside was a box.  In this box were packing peanuts layers of bubble wrap.  By the very least, this is very sturdy packaging.  Though, it makes me wonder if DSH could reduce the package size to better fit the order proportions.  Nonetheless, I am excited to try these 2 free samples.  If I end up not liking them, by the very least I have something for my destach pile.  I obtained these bottles October 18, 2024.

**Mangoes On Ibiza no.525 VdP**: I was surprised to see this perfume.  The name intrigued me.  I like mango perfumes quite a bit and the number made it a bit cryptic.  Even when I end up not enjoying the perfume, surprise samples are very fun for me to try.

>This once ‚Äúlocal‚Äù secret is now available to all of our clients: a one of a kind perfume creation, made with upcycled bottles, specialty materials from olfactory / visual art projects, and big time creative juice. We will post new arrivals as we make them available every month or two‚Ä¶ detailing the scent concept and the note structure.

The liquid in the bottle smells vague.  The hints in the bottle are not important as skin changes the scent.  Nonetheless, I find it fun to do which is why I do this every new review.  The perfumes smells similarly vague on my skin.  I am not surprised given the description of the perfume.  Unlike my other DSH samples, there is a surprisingly generous amount of fluid.  It appears to be almost full.  The color is pink-ish.  While the concept is cool, unfortunately I won't get much milage out of this perfume.  A lucky soul may receive it in the future.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Aqua de coco**: This was one of 2 perfume samples given to me for free in my order of mango cocktail.  It sounds nice, though I'll have to judge how much I like it.

>Coconut water is one of the most refreshing and replenishing sensations of summer. Our Aqua de Coco is just as light and cooling‚Ä¶ with that subtle hint of salt mixed in with the creamy, watery coconut fragrance. What a perfect accompaniment to summer fun.

I smell fresh coconuts in the bottle.  It isn't that sweet but it has the dimensions of coconut I remember smelling when I processed 2 fresh coconuts.  It smells similar on my skin but less pronounced.  It becomes very light on my skin.  For what it is, it is a refreshing coconut.  However, the lack of fragrance leaves me disappointed.  I'm not entirely surprised given that coconuts already aren't the most aromatic fruits.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

As a side note, I have been experimenting with layering perfumes out of curiosity.  Some perfumes layer well while other ones may fight and the winner mask the other perfume.

# SunSphere Scents

I have been eyeing this brand for a while now.  The entire aesthetics of it reminds me a bit of a dear friend who has since moved away.  I always appreciate when samples allow me to select from a collection of option to try.  The packaging was simple yet very secure.  It came in a box with strips of paper confetti-like dampener.  I appreciate this as it is very to the point, especially when I am only getting a singular sample pack.  Ordering from the site was very standard and smooth.  I look forward to trying these perfumes.  I obtained these bottles October 18, 2024.

**Sunsphere sunset**: Given the name of this brand and the name of this perfume I felt almost obligated to try it.  That is why it is in this review.  I look forward to seeing what I think of it.

>golden amber, ethereal lavender, sandalwood, a hint of coffee

On my skin, I smell something a bit fruity, soft, and a bit sweet.  A strange interaction with my throat happens.  The scent initially dried it out slightly. Could be that I need to hydrate up as it is morning though so I will not fault the perfume.  The smell reminds me a bit of watered down juice.  I unfortunately don't really vibe with this perfume. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**1991**:

>saltwater, grapefruit, an old boardwalk

The sunsphere scent perfumes come in a spray so it is a tad more difficult to get a proper whiff of just the liquid.  On my skin I smell a hint of grapefruit that quickly permeates the air.  The salty scent is a nice touch.  The boardwalk isn't particularly noticable.  I'm guessing it is supposed to be a woodsy-note of sorts.  It has a somewhat similar profile to sunohere sunset.  I'm not particularly impressed.  Someone else will get more enjoyment out of it than me.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Candoro Marble**:

>smooth sandalwood, aged peppermint, rose

When I open the cap, I smell a faintly clean scent.  The peppermint quickly becomes apparent.  However, it has strange dimensions.  The rose does not smell present while the sandalwood is a bit more noticeable.  I smell mint but nothing else.  It reminds me of the native mint I would smell whenever I'd rub leaves.  It isn't a scent I'm feeling very enthusiastic about. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

So far, it isn't looking very good for sunsphere scents.  Maybe I chose wrong.  I hope at least one perfume will impress me.

**Lake Days**:

>clear lake water, sunscreen, inner tubes, mimosa tree blossoms, cedarwood

The perfume smells a bit salty in the bottle.  There isn't much scent given off.  I smell some wood.  On my skin, I do not smell very much.  There isn't much to review because it isn't giving me very much to smell, unfortunately.  This is all reviewed with 1 spritz.  I might giving them a second smell over with two spritz later to see if it makes much of a difference.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Coconut**:

>creamy coconut, skin musk, a worn leather bracelet, grass

In the bottle I smell something skin to coconuts.  The husks of coconuts seem more apparent.  The grass comes in not long after.  Within seconds it switches from leather to grass again, the coconut having left the room in mere moments.  It is a relatively subdued smell.  It is okay. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ I probably smelled it a bit more strongly because when opening it to take a whiff of the liquid it started to leak, likely having been topped off before the lid being screwed on and shipped.

So far, I am finding out I prefer the sweet dimensions of coconut.  However, I have yet to sample a savory coconut perfume (perhaps modeled after a savory coconut dish).

**Hodges**:

>forgotten books, vanilla, orris, sheer woods

The perfume smells very try in the bottle.  It is akin to crisp paper.  I can smell the orris, a hint of vanilla, and the paper.  I'm unsure if I really smell the woods.  Overall, this perfume got what it described about right.  However, it isn't really my cup of tea.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ This perfume would do well with a book lover.

Unfortunately, none of the perfumes from Sunsphere Scents were hits.  I do appreciate what they were going for, being not very sweet perfumes.  I'm glad other people enjoy this house.

# Wild Veil

This is a perfume house I had only recently heard out.  I was intrigued.  I had never bought a high-end perfume before so I thought to get some samples.  The package came in as expected.  There was no fanfare.  It came in a simple package with a tiny cardboard box inside.  There was a wild veil sticker in the box.  In the box is 3 tiny vials with what appears to be a dried pansy.  I can tell it is real as it smells nice, has an organic feel and is brittle.  Each vial appears to have a bit of brown paper wrapped around it with hand written names of the kind of perfume inside them.  There appears to be no leakage or damage.  I obtained these bottles on October 21, 2024.

**Passion Flower Soliflore**:  This was a perfume I selected because it sounded interesting.  I have been a fan of passionfruit for a while now.  The fruit and flowers of a plant can be wildly different.  I am half hoping I smell something a bit fruity but given that this is a floral perfume, I expect something very nice.

>Earthy, salty, tender, erotic, sweet

It smells like chai tea.  It is akin to hay.  I do not mind it.  It is quite nice.  Though, this was a very expected result.  It smells fresh and earthy with sweetness.  I am unsure what to think of this perfume.  It certain is not a rose.  As it evolves, it becomes sweeter yet this change is subtle.  3.5/5

**Petrichor Soliflore**: When selecting perfumes I was limited by what I could ask for.  The site had given me limits.  I couldn't request any of the solid perfumes as they wouldn't work in the samples.  Wild Veil also has a massive catalogue so it took me a bit but I eventually settled for three perfumes.  This was one of them.  I do not have any rain-themed perfumes yet so I'll see what I think of it.

>The brink of rain hangs fragrant in the air, preceding the electrifying odor of ozone sparked by forks of lightning piercing the atmosphere.

The liquid in the bottle does not have very much scent.  The scent is also very light on my skin.  I can kind of smell something but it isn't very pronounced.  I unfortunately cannot give it a proper review.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Salem**: As a third selection, chose this one to try something unlike the other two in some way.  the notes make it sound lovely.  If I were to guess it will smell a bit sweet, spiced, with notes on the green spectrum with fruit in the mix.  The plums and apricots will likely not appear in the scent profile for me.  I have a good feeling about this one.

>Cortland apples, muscat raisins, New England roses, nutmeg, squash blossom, baked pumpkin, colonial rum, black cherries, plums, apricots, Boston tea, honeysuckle, spice

In the bottle I smell something fresh.  It reminds me if medicine but not the unpleasant dimensions of a medicinal smell.  It is a sweet, earthy, green, warm smell.  It reminds me of scented pinecones and cedar wood.  There is something very comforting about this smell.  It is like if I stepped into cedar cabin and smelled a spiced tea brewing.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ This is by far my favorite of the three.  As it evolves the spices become more prominent.  The roses also come out to play though it is subtle.

I was excited to try this house.  It is very nice and unlike the other houses I have sampled so far.  I might try more of their perfumes in the future.  This is an expensive house which limits how much I can sample at a time each month.  I'll have to admit that the fact this house grows a majority if not all of the ingredients that they use does appeal to me.

# D'Orange

This is the first non-indie I will be reviewing.  I was recommended it by an acquaintance.  The perfumes came in a much larger box.  This box appears to be custom as it as words printed on it and the website.  Inside this box is a much smaller box containing the perfumes and bubblewrap.  I've said this before, but I prefer when my perfume comes in appropriately sized packages that aren't oversized.  The perfumes also come in even smaller boxes.  These boxes each has a part sectioned off that contain the small, glass vials.  There is no damage or leakage I can smell.  I obtained these bottles on October 21, 2024.

On a somewhat unrelated tangent, it appears google tracked this purchase and is giving me annoying ads for this brand in youtube.  This has made me feel discouraged from buying from this brand again.  On the bright side, they are brief and do very minimal to influence my opinion of the products (some perfume commercials go very overboard).  I'll be the judge of if the quality holds up by the very least.

**Dangerous Complicity**: I had chosen to try this perfume because my acquaintances wanted to hear what I thought of it.  I'll see what I think about it.  It sounds fruity and sweet so I might like it.

>Once the aphrodisiac rush of ginger and rum burns through, this perfume unveils this passionate pact between fruit, flower and flesh.¬†

The scent is light.  One spritz barely feels like enough.  A second spritz does not seem to change much either.  It has barely any more scent than water.  I unfortunately cannot rate this perfume properly. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Hermann**: Like the one above it, I was recommended to try this one.  I was told it smells light high quality mint.

>A cool, sheer and woody blend that is unlike any other.

It smells akin to green mint with wood.  It is a nice smell.  It reminds me of the plant without the methane notes.  I'll have to sit on this one.  It is so far the better of the two I have tried.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**I am trash**: I have been on a fruit perfume binge for a bit now.  This perfume will be another one in this personal trend.  It does genuinely sound nice.  Hopefully, this perfume will smell better than the other ones.

>Rose petals, already distilled Sandalwood chips, and even leftover Apples from the food industry to create the most beautiful fruity, floral, and woody blend.

One spritz gave me a generous amount of perfume.  It smells like sweet apples.  I do like it, though it does lack sour dimensions.  I like my apples more than just sweet.  It is a lovely perfume nonetheless.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**You or Someone Like You**: I forgot why I chose this one.  The name sounded interesting.  The description doesn't seem to really explain what it smells like, especially as someone who has never been to Los Angeles.

>...Anne is a recent transplant in awe of the possibility that lingers in the crisp blue air of Los¬†Angeles.

...It certainly smells like perfume.  It exists.  Honestly, I have no idea what to say.  It smells about average.  I think I smell aldehydes and a hint of apple.  It is not very interesting to me.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Trying D'Orange was an experience.  However, I did not come back with any interesting experiences.  This brand isn't my cup of tea.  It was sort of fun.  I know I am being extra harsh in this brand.  Understand that commercials sour my mood.  Here's to hoping I don't get another D'orange commercial.

# Hexennacht

I had tried this house previously.  While not everything was a hit, I really liked their Boo-Berry.  I decided to get a full size as I enjoyed it enough to have long-term.  I did not expect to get a sample.  The package came in an envelope with the bigger bottle wrapped in cardboard to cushion it.  The sample was wrapped in a piece of paper with writing on it and The City printed.  I unfortunately, tore this paper up as I opened it so I was not able to read it.  There was a delay in shipping but overall it came in just fine.  The bottles have a high quality feel to them.  The sample is not the normal want and opens up like any vial would.  I opened it to get a peak and the accidental whiff I got from it was divine. I obtained this bottle on October 23, 2024.

**Pepparkr√§m**: this was a surprise sample for me.  I bought the boo-berry without any expectations for free samples because some houses don't give out any.  This is a generous amount for a sample.  It looks to be 2 ml or maybe 2.5 ml.  Either way, I am excited to try it.

>Dr. Pepper soda, vanilla bean ice cream.

I had never drank a Dr. Pepper before so I do not have any reference in it.  When I open it up I smell something like vanilla yogurt.  On my skin, this quickly changes.  It goes from a dairy-like sweetness to being an artificial sweetener.  It reminds me of pepto bismol or cotton candy flavored pink suckers.  Unfortunately, this is not a scent I desire to wear.  This is probably the very first time I liked how it smelled in the bottle more than on my skin. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

# BlackHeart Tart

I had been eyeing this house for a bit now.  White chocolate isn't a very common scent so when I heard of a perfume that was all about that I knew I had to give it a try.  This house is very sweet-gourmand focussed which is in line with my tastes.  The package came in from ajevies as I wanted to reduce my shipping costs. It came like expected: a simple envelope with bubblewrap protecting the bottles.  It also came in with 2 maple candies and 2 random stickers.  I obtained these bottles on October 23, 2024.

**Butter Me Up**: This is a perfume I'm excited for.  It is a white chocolate perfume.  It sounds absolutely decedent.  However, will it be too sweet?  Let's find out.

>Velvety cocoa butter and golden vanilla are mingled with sweet amber musk and a touch of aromatic ylang ylang essential oil. Butter Me Up will melt your heart with its baby soft, comforting aroma.

In the bottle is a very very lightly sweet scent.  On my skin it is also very light.  This is a perfume that permeates the air with a light scent.  However, up close it isn't really detectable.  It seems to build slowly.  Unfortunately, the scent remains quite light.  I'll have to toss it into the destach pile. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Olive My Love**: I had chosen this one because I haven't tried a perfume with any olive theming.  Upon seeing the description, however, this appears to be a citrus perfume.

>Reminiscent of a¬†Mediterranean orange grove. Aromatic orange flower, citrusy mandarin, and herbaceous green vines.

There is a hint of oranges with a larger dose of leaves when I smell the bottle.  On my skin, the orange blossoms and greens come out.  It almost smells like there are spices in it.  It smells like it would go good in a hight quality soap.  While the perfumw scent isn't particularly strong it smells good.  3.5/5

# Lucky #9

This was a house I had heard about.  Because it was on ajevies I decided to give it a try to go with my order of blackheart tart.  I do not know much on it besides it is cat-themed.  It came in the same package as my blackheart tart order.  I obtained these bottles on October 23, 2024.

**Cabana Cat**: I chose this perfume because I am still in the mood to try coconut perfumes.  This one sounded pretty nice.  It is probably not going to be too sweet.

>Young green coconut cream, tropical orchid, toasted praline.

The coconut and pralines become apparent when taking a whiff of the bottle.  The blend is interesting on my skin.  There is a fruitiness in it, though I cannot quite say what it would be.  The orchid might be there but I'm not sure what to look for for that note.  The pralines add a nice, sweet undertone without being overpowering.  I quite like it! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Tomcat**: I wasn't too sure what my second choice would be so I settled in a rather mundane named perfume.  It also sounds like it'll be a nice rounding on my selection.

>Cedar and sandalwoods, a light verdant musk, whispers of ocean and mint.

It smells green in the bottle like ivy leaves.  The green notes strengthen on my skin.  It is a clean smell with some familiarity to the place I currently live.  Unlike werewold or persian tearoom, this is a rather simple green scent without much else to its undertones.  Overall it is very nice.  I'll have to see if I want a full size or not. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

These two samples have convinced me that I should give more samples from Lucky #9 a try.  The fact it is on Ajevies means I can sample it with other samples found in that site as it reduces the overall shipping cost.

# Solstice Scents

This is admittedly one of my favorite houses.  I will usually come back with least 1 perfume sample that I want a full size of.  The package was a back stuffed with black tissue paper.  There was a small mishap on shipping, however I managed to fix the address and receive my package.  The packages tend to come with cards that advertise their other perfumes.  This is probably one of the few ads I actually enjoy because it is easy to store and doesn't take up any screen space (or intrude on the music I listen to). I obtained these bottles on October 28, 2024.

**Victorian Tearoom**: I chose this as the free sample because it sounded interesting.  Though, admittedly, I did not glance at the note profile until now.  It sounds quite fruity.

>Palmarosa, Kumquat-Orange Marmalade, Chamomile, Rose, Lemon, Black Tea, Amber Base

The orange is the first thing I smell in the bottle.  On my skin I smell a mixture of smells from the sour marmalade, lemon, black tea, and chamomile.  The rose is slow to come out but when it does it adds yet another layer of complexity.  This is quite an interesting smell and not comparable to any other perfumes I've tried so far.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

I expect to try more SS perfumes in the future.  This is definitely a house I will return to time and time again.  The popularity of SS is warranted in my opinion.

# Posie

Posie was one house I had heard about from this sub.  It came in an envelope and inside were my samples packages in decorative tissue paper with a golden sticker sealing it.  I am quite excited to see I think of my samples.  I've heard good things about this house.  I obtained these bottles on October 28, 2024

**Hera**: A free sample was offered with my purchase in which I chose this perfume.  Another strawberry perfume wouldn't hurt.  I'm uncertain how much I'll like it as strawberry could turn into a candy scent rather than a fruity scent full of dimensions.

>slices of yellow cake layered with strawberry jam, fluffy vanilla icing, soft pink lotus blossoms

The vanilla is the first thing I smell when opening the bottle.  It is a subtle scent.  The yellow cake comes out on my skin skin with a whisp of strawberry.  I am not getting any of the delightful sour notes, unfortunately.   On a positive note, this isn't an overly sweet scent.  The perfume itself isn't that strong either as I cannot really pick up on it when I take a testing whiff of my wrists.  Someone else may feel much more joy about it than me when I destach.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Twice to Tea**: I quite enjoy tea perfumes.  The green notes tend to be nice without being overpowering.  This sounds like a sweet tea perfume which I do not think I've tried this type yet.

>a strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk

The scent in the bottle is like green tea.  The milky notes quickly come out on my skin.  It is slightly sweet.  There is a whisper of lavender as well.  The vanilla is subtle.  This perfume smells like a pleasant drink.  I do wonder if it pairs well with my rose mallow.  3.5/5

**Velvet Moon**: I had stumbled upon this one a few times.  To my memory, the most recent mention I read was in regard to smelling like a gay wizard.  I too would like to smell like a gay wizard so I am definitely giving it a try.

>cardamom, a wood-paneled library filled with old books, black pepper, a velvet dressing gown, paper + ink, flickering beeswax candles

It smells subtly sweet in the bottle.  On my skin I smell sweet paper.  It is a clean scent.  It isn't a particularly strong smell.  It permeates the snell as something spiced and sweet with the bookish paper notes being more noticable up close.  I'll give it another try later for sure.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Whisper Your Bitter Things**: My last review included at least 1 coffee perfume.  Reviewing them made me realize that I want a bitter coffee scent.  I was excited to learn about this perfume and had to try it.

>pressed coffee beans, dried clove bud + cassia bark, jasmine and neroli blossoms, roasted vanilla pods

I am quite happy about this one.  It smells like a good cup of coffee.  It isn't overly sweet but it does have mellow sweet notes.  However, I do wish it was a stronger scent.  I'm unsure if I can smell the other floral notes.  The vanilla does come through and add some sweetness without being overpowering.  Either way, It is one of the better coffee perfumes I've smelled.  3.5/5

Posie was an interesting try.  For the most part, the perfume descriptions are quite accurate.  All of the ones that I have tried so far seem a bit weak for my tastes.  I will definitely have to give more of the catalogue a try at some point.

# Hoshi Gato

Much like Posie the package had come in a simple envelope except it was lavender purple.  In it was a sweet paper smelling paper.  In cursive writing the sender expressed their excitement to see if I like what has been picked out for me.  There was a cute red stamp of Japanese on it.  It also has a card with contact info.  The perfumes are in a tiny lilac cardboard box with a hot pink sticker with a simplified text logo.  The entirety of this packaging is quite cute.  I look forward to reviewing these.  I obtained these bottles on October 28, 2024.

**Blueberry Skies**: This is yet another blueberry perfume.  I am excited to try as I quite enjoy blueberry as a flavor and smell.  The notes make me believe it'll be a calming blueberry.  Blueberry and lavender sounds lovely

>blueberry, Lavender fleurs, Hyacinth, Orris root, vanilla, cedarwood

because this comes in a spray bottle I'll have a harder time taking a whiff of the bottle.  The lids are on quite tight so I'll judge it from on my skin alone.  The sprayer takes only 2 pumps to work.  In my experience, some sprayers take many more pumps.  The blueberry becomes quickly apparent.  This is akin to a candy blueberry rather than a natural blueberry smell.  It smells quite nice regardless.  The lavender is soft and the cedar works well.  The vanilla note elevates the sweet fruit.  I really like this one, though I'm unsure if I'll go for a full size.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Creep**: This was a perfume included in the sample pack.  It sounds like it'll be on brand with October, the spooky month.  What is a better time than now, the 31st to try it?

>Gravestones, Wet dirt, Moss, Crisp green apple, French lavender, Hyacinth, Orris root, Patchouli, Benzoin, Oud, Oakmoss, Cetalox

The green apple and dirt come out as the very first scents.  The lavendar sweetens it and the cetalox makes it smell cleaner.  The oud is kept very low and seems to be used for another layer on the dirty.  This smells like eating a sweet and sour green apple on a graveyard shift.  It is very nice.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Death of a Strawberry**: This one excites me.  I love strawberry perfumes.  Though, judging by creep and blueberry skies this may very well be a candy strawberry scent rather than anything realistic.  Either way, I'm excited to try this one.

>Dying strawberry, pine needles, Jasmine grandiflorum , sweet damask rose, ylang ylang, Bourbon vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss, patchouli

My hunch was correct.  This is a candy strawberry scent.  It has some... interesting dimensions to it.  The dying strawberry comes through maybe a bit strong.  It smells a bit like your average strawberry candy.  It's okay.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Frooty**: This is yet another fruit themed perfume!  This ones sounds like it could be quite lovely.  I do not have a fruit salad style perfume yet so if I happen to like it enough, I could have some extra variety to my collection in the future

>sugared lemon, cherry, classic fruity cereal, Almond milk

The sugared lemons come out as the first note.  The cherry isn't that far behind.  The classic fruity cereal note quickly follows.  It smells exactly as expected.  It is quite a joyful smell. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Meloncholy**: I remember hearing about this perfume in an email I had with the creator of Hoshi Gato.  It peaked my interested because as of writing this I have not tried a melon perfume yet.  I'm uncertain how much I'll like it because the smell of cucumbers often makes me gag.  Hopefully, this won't smell like cucumbers.

>green melon, forest greenery, Aquatic musk, tuberose absolute, French lavender, Tobacco absolute, Incense, spiced woods, Veramoss

...I smell cucumbers.  It smells exactly like cucumbers.  I didn't gag but I'm also not really pleased.  This is a me problem.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Rainbow**: The graphics on these perfumes are pretty and cute.  Rainbow is one great example of this.  The scent list makes it sound fresh and floral.

>ozone, blooming grass, water lily, Wild strawberry, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Misty air, Vanilla, Floral musks

The strawberry is subtle yet noticeable.  The grass nite is very quick to come in.  I can smell the ylang-ylang and jasmine as well.  It smells light, fresh, a bit fruity, and floral.  I enjoy the simplicity of this scent.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Sun Catcher**: This is the one I am probably most excited about.  I like fruity perfume and this one sounds like the definition of it.

>sugared pineapple, cranberry, cherry, Mango, Strawberry, Rose, vanilla, black tea

It smells like fruit snacks.  I like fruit snacks, though I don't think I want to smell like snacks.  Nonetheless, it is a high quality perfume. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

Hoshi Gato has proven to be a nice house.  I'll likely review more perfumes from them in the future.  Though, their selection is small so I may need to wait for when they release more to get a nice number of them (4 - 5 samples) to review at once.

# NAVA

This is a house I am familiar with.  I don't think this house needs an introduction.  I found a decant that offers samples of NAVA perfumes and I am very pleased about it.  I am excited to try these.  I specifically chose a selection of fruit-themed scents.  The strawberry crystalline I have has become a wonderful staple in my selection.  I obtained these bottles on November 1st, 2024.

**Coconut Moonstone**: Ever since I tried rose mallow by Solstice Scents I have been really wanting to find another coconut perfume that smelled pleasing to me.  I have a good feeling about this perfume.

>Egyptian Coconut Husk, Studio Limited Moonstone (The true Husk, black and white Fleck, essence and whole of African White Vanilla with a kiss of Crystalline) and a drop of peach

I smell sweet, fresh coconut in the bottle.  on my skin it is a silkier coocnut smell. It is quite nice with the right amount of sweetness for a fresh coconut perfume. The only down side is how short it lasts on my skin before fading- mere minutes.  It smells good but I wish it lasted longer. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Desert Fig & Ambre Noir**: I do not have a fig perfume yet which is why I am trying one.  I have memories of being near fig trees and smelling the fragrant bark as I prepared a branch to propagate a new tree.  Fig bark is one of my favorite smells.

>Ripe Desert Fig, Blackened Fig skin, Vietnamese Agarwood, Amber accord, White Patchouli, Red Musk, Desert Myrrh infused Musk, Amber resin accord, Desert Nevada Rock Rose, Frankincense and bruised Violet petal essence

upon opening the bottle I get a whiff of something sweet and soft.  On my skin I get something sweet, somewhat smokey, musky, and woodsy.  It is complex and a bit unfamiliar.  It has undertones of spice kind of like cloves.  There is definitely floral aspects to it.  I like it a lot, though I don't see myself wearing it regularly.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Eternal Tut Ankh Amun**: For the sake of trying another eternal chose this one.  I have tried eternal ankh before so I'm this one will smell nice as well.

>Bourbon Vanille Absolute, Crystalline Absolute, Tonka Absolute, Bastet's Vanilla Bean Absolute accord, and White Amber

The smell of sweet vanilla is very recognizable in the bottle.  It is relatively light on my skin.  It smells sweet and woody.  It is soft and nice.  It is a good vanilla without being overly sweet.  While it is a good vanilla perfume, I can see other people appreciating it more. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Raspberry Cream & Roses**: It is a fact that I love raspberries.  I had chosen this perfume because I do not have a raspberry one yet.  Though, I hope the roses do not overpower the other notes.

>Sweet Raspberry accord, Toasted Coconut, Vanilla Cream accord, Vanilla Fleck, Bulgarian Rose Otto, Red Rose petals

In the bottle, the rose aspect is very strong.  It smells good by the very least.  On my skin it smells like sweet rose cream with some raspberries inside.  The coconut is also there.  I like it, though I feel it is a bit too sweet.  The raspberry note isn't very pronounced, either.  Overall, it smells good but is maybe not raspberry enough.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Star Fruit Mango & Egyptian Musk**: I have found I like mango perfumes.  I feel like star fruit would add to it.  Both are citrus-y though mango is definitely a heavier scent

>Fresh Star Fruit essence, Egyptian Musk, Hawaiian Mango, Peach essence, crushed Star Fruit seeds.

When I open the bottle I smell something delightfully sour and tropical.  The musk comes through with a clean note.  It quickly permeates as a sweet, tart, juicy smell with a hint of poweryness.  The starfruit and mango work wonderfully together.  I very well might get a full size of this.  4.5/5

While not everything was a hit, it was a very nice experience nonetheless.  I really liked that I could try these out.  Though, I wish I would have liked the raspberry perfume more.  NAVA does their fruit very well.  I'll be trying them out more in the future.

# BPAL

This is a house I hear a lot about but haven't had a chance to try till now.  It looks to be a very popular choice.  The decant that I bought from offered samples of BPAL perfumes that aren't normally available to sample.  I chose a well-rounded sample set this time around.  I obtained these bottles on November 1st, 2024.

**Arachne of Lydia**: I have admittedly never read the last unicorn.  However, I want to.  If I like these perfumes enough I might look for an audiobook to read along to.  This would be one of the fruity perfumes in the collection that I decided to try.

>dusty clove and blackcurrant

The currant and cloves smell relatively mellow in the bottle.  The clove scent gets much stronger when on my wrist.  Despite that, the currant is still in the background, though faintly.  It is a simple scent.  I am a simple man, I quite like the scent of cloves.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Lady Amathea**: This perfume sounded quite nice when I picked it out,  It sounds like a floral perfume with a sweet gourmand leaning.

>A luminous white winter musk with lilac, wisteria, white chocolate, white mint, and tuberose

the mint mixes with something that hints at floral in the bottle.  It passively gives out white chocolate when opened which is an interesting behavior.  On my skin I get a mix of mint, wisteria, and tuberose.  The white appears to prefer to permeate rather than be sniffed up close.  It is soft and nice.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Magic, Do As You Will**: apparently my written review of this perfume was not saved.  I write this review in phases as a draft, revise it, then post the final result.  I chose this perfume because I thought it would smell nice.

>frankincense, guggul gum, mastic, onycha accord, styrax, and deep purple fruits.

Unfortunately, despite the scent list, all I really smelled some a light berry scent and some sweetness.  It was a bit disappointing because I was expecting more nuance to it. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**The King's Daughter**: This was yet another perfume I had selected because it sounded quite nice.  I like the scent of lilacs so this one may end up smelling very nice to me.

>lilac musk, sandalwood, sweet pea, watermelon accord, pale woods, elemi, and oakmos

upon opening the bottle I get a light scent of cinnamon.  My guess is that the sweet pea, lilac, oakmoss, and elemi (had to look it up) combined to make a scent in the spice family.  On my skin, however, this quickly changed.  It smells like sweet, floral licorice.  Despite what many may think of licorice, I enjoy the taste of it.  It is pretty nice.  I'll have to compare it with Lady Amathea as they have some similarities. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**Witch-Cursed Castle**: This is a more earthy perfume I have selected.  While I am finding earthy perfumes are not necessarily my favorite, I still enjoy the experience.

>Weed-strewn oak, opoponax, wet stone, creaking redwood, and desolate olibanum.

It smells a bit sweet and slightly spiced in the bottle.  This changes on my skin.  Its sweetness changes to more of a hay-like sweetness with hints of wood and brightness. It smells nice.  The notes work in harmony to create a nice experience.  I'm not entirely sure if it smells like anything familiar to me.  Maybe like the natural, sweet scent of clean skin without any of the animalistic notes? ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

BPAL is a house I have been excited to try.  I'm glad to have been given this opportunity.  Overall, these perfumes smell very high quality and for the most part hit the mark on what they are trying to achieve.  I look forward to try more of their perfumes in the future.  I'll likely get a few full sizes later on.  For now, I'll be further testing and getting comfortable with what samples I have.

# Closing Thoughts

This is by far the most perfumes I've sampled at once.  It will likely be the most perfumes I sample at once for a long time.  I do not intend on doing massive samples like this every time.   I've finally gotten into sampling floral perfumes which I'm quite happy about and tried a non-indie brand.  I've even gotten around to sampling a few white chocolate perfumes.  Though, I feel my selection is beginning to round out quite nicely.  I do not know if I'll get to sampling more this month or perhaps waiting until later.  I will close with a few questions:

* Are there any deep, dark chocolate perfumes?
* What is the most fragrant white chocolate perfume you know of?
* Do you know of any very new indie houses I should try?",4,1730860756.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

When he got home, i was taking a nap and during that time he was sending her pictures of his dog to her, all while within arm reach of where i was laying down. I didn‚Äôt have to dig deeper into his other convos if the first was already so telling.

I feel disgusted that i fell for this man. He seem to enjoy any attention he‚Äôs getting and doesn‚Äôt care about respect. When i asked him why didnt he tell me he was meeting her, he said he didnt have to. He rolled his eyes whenever i talk to him, im not talking about one simple roll, but it‚Äôs basically every reply comes with an eye roll. He said i was just finding an excuse to leave and i was only using him for a vacation. Seriously?! I had to send my dog for boarding and pay half the tickets and just took him out to a luxury meal last night and here he is CHEATING ON ME.

I packed my bags, booked an airbnb, got on an Uber, blocked him everywhere and im lying on the couch while typing this. Tell me i wasn‚Äôt rash.",16,1730859448.0,LongDistance,5,0.95,False

1gknwqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1gknwqv/for_my_12th_birthday_my_dad_surprised_me_with_two/,"For my 12th birthday, my dad surprised me with two real life mermaids.","I'm currently completely at a loss what to do. 

I (21f) have just escaped my parents, after finding something horrifying in my dad‚Äôs beach house. 

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid‚Äîwhether that was TV shows, movies, books‚Äîany marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss‚Äîalso known as the deep end of our neighbor‚Äôs pool. 

Mom said I didn‚Äôt realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool. 

So there I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom‚Äôs retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor‚Äôs patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn‚Äôt go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut... 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. 

I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands‚Ä¶. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*‚ÄúOkay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don‚Äôt you try fake water?‚Äù*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids‚Äô games about solving puzzles underwater‚Äîand immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids‚Äîbeautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn‚Äôt, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation‚Äîthe squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he‚Äôd always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn‚Äôt swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. 

Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But‚Ä¶ neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother‚Äôs room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don‚Äôt think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead... 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn‚Äôt get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that ‚ÄúHarvey loves the water!‚Äù made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out. Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn‚Äôt understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving. Did such a thing exist? I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy‚Äîbefore feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I couldn't control.

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, ‚ÄúIt wasn't his fault.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut it *was* my dad‚Äôs fault,‚Äù I told her, leaning forward in my chair. ‚ÄúHe killed my brother.‚Äù

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag‚Äì it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. ‚ÄúWell, maybe you should forgive him.‚Äù

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

‚ÄúIt was an accident, Sadie,‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúYour father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.‚Äù She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. ‚ÄúHarvey asked him to take him out during a storm.‚Äù

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. ‚ÄúBut you said‚Äî‚Äù

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom‚Äôs eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. ‚ÄúDo you want to get takeout tonight?‚Äù

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad‚Äôs fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids‚Äô stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey‚Äôs death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. ‚ÄúGrieving is an individual emotion!‚Äù Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother‚Äôs death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears..

Mom definitely wasn't over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, ‚ÄúHow's school?‚Äù 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something‚Äì someone‚Äì normal. 

I found ‚Äònormal‚Äô in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, ‚ÄúHappy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!‚Äù

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. Dad‚Äôs new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, ‚ÄúJust give it a little more time,‚Äù I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad‚Äôs place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father‚Äôs house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  But running away seemed childish‚Äîeven for a soon to be twelve year old. I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad‚Äôs mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

‚ÄúSadie?‚Äù Dad‚Äôs voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home‚Äì stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom‚Äôs house. 

Dad‚Äôs was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad‚Äôs voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. ‚ÄúI'm in the basement, sweetie!‚Äù

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself attracted to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises on the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad‚Äôs house were yet to be renovated. Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. 

My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. 

Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, ‚ÄúHappy 12th birthday!‚Äù

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad‚Äôs words, my gaze glued to the glass..

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. ‚ÄúI asked my friends for a favour,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey specialise in marine research, and‚Ä¶well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.‚Äù Dad‚Äôs grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. 

I don't know what I was expecting. 

Was it a new species of fish? 

‚ÄúThey're shy.‚Äù Dad hummed. ‚ÄúJust stay there, and they'll come over to you.‚Äù

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *‚ÄúThey?‚Äù*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass‚Äîa beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her waist was rugged, carved into her flesh.

Gills. This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn‚Äôt* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. ‚ÄúThe male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.‚Äù

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. ‚ÄúThey're yours, Sadie,‚Äù Dad murmured into my hair. ‚ÄúI have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.‚Äù

‚ÄúMermaids.‚Äù I said. 

Dad nodded. ‚ÄúWell, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,‚Äù he chuckled, ‚ÄúThey are mermaids.‚Äù

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and  narrow features, told me he belonged in the ocean. 

I had dreamed of being able to breathe underwater, and this boy didn't need air to breathe, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. ‚ÄúWe haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.‚Äù Dad‚Äôs eyes were wide. ‚ÄúIt's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.‚Äù

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

‚ÄúWhat do you think you're going to call them?‚Äù Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. ‚ÄúThey don't have names?‚Äù

He shrugged, and then Dad‚Äôs expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here‚Äì and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. ‚ÄúThey were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.‚Äù

I met the girl‚Äôs eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy‚Äôs hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

‚ÄúFalan.‚Äù I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. ‚ÄúThe male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúHis paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.‚Äù

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

‚ÄúAira.‚Äù

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúI think she likes her name,‚Äù he said, heading to the door. ‚ÄúElle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.‚Äù

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me.

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too‚Äì or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, ‚ÄúOh, wow, it's a weird device with a light. I've already seen one.‚Äù

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pok√©mon. I think it was the bright colours, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pok√©mon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was him who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad‚Äôs beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I came to them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide.

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so why was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. 

He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

‚ÄúYou want me to open the tank?‚Äù I said, motioning upwards. 

‚ÄúSadie.‚Äù 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. ‚ÄúI know they're pretty to look at, Sadie, but they're also dangerous.‚Äù 

He nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. ‚ÄúThese beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.‚Äù 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad‚Äôs basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira‚Äôs eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from my new college campus every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit. 

I headed back to Dad‚Äôs beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid‚Äôs eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, ‚ÄúNice try.‚Äù

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

‚ÄúWhere's Falan?‚Äù I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter‚Äì which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle‚Äôs, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother‚Äôs clothes. 

But he was dead. He died when I was nine years old. I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. 

I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold.

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. Two college ID‚Äôs. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were fucking HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. I don't even remember standing up. With the ID tag in my hands, I strode over to the tank, pressing Aira‚Äôs identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

‚ÄúIt's okay,‚Äù I told her calmly. ‚ÄúWhere's Falan?‚Äù

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

‚ÄúMatthew.‚Äù I corrected, quickly. ‚ÄúWhere is Matthew?‚Äù

Before she could respond, my father‚Äôs voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira‚Äôs head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father‚Äôs footsteps following. I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind a large Amazon package. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy‚Äôs legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. ‚ÄúIt's okay,‚Äù he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. ‚ÄúOnce your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.‚Äù

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. 

Dad carried the boy up a ladder to the surface. I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. 

‚ÄúIt's okay,‚Äù he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, ‚ÄúI know it will hurt, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.‚Äù I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy‚Äôs throat, slicing it open, and dumping him in the water. 

The boy sank, sharp red exploding around him, tainting the water. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught him, cradling the boy in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The boy jolted suddenly in Aira‚Äôs arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flew from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities. 

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and pinned to the wall. 

I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human man cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act.

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan‚Äôs body jolted, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

His body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't.

His body was cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso.

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin.

Gills. 

When I felt the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. There's no sign of Mom or Dad. The only thing I have right is Mom‚Äôs stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me. 

Please help me save the people trapped in my father‚Äôs basement.",16,1730859357.0,Odd_directions,3,1.0,False

We worked together but he has moved on to another company but we live near each other. I think initially, the hesitation was us working together but that's not there anymore. I am 95% sure that he likes me back but I don't know for sure. We have been spending a lot of time together. For example, last week we basically hung out 4 out of 7 days and when we meet up on a weekend, we spend hours sitting somewhere just talking. He is always offering to help me with this course that I am taking (he has taken it before). He pays for my food often and he walks me all the way home almost everytime. A few days back I asked him to come inside for a coffee but he said no so I am trying not to push things. He is the kind of person who takes time trusting people. Recently, he has been going through something rough and I am really trying to be there for him. I want him to know that I care about him which I think I've made clear through my actions. I've been reaching out to him, checking in on him to see how he is doing and I met up with him the day on which this ""event"" happened and just talked to him to help him feel better. 

He is the kind of guy who really suppresses his feelings and won't let his walls down easily but he has opened up to me quite alot. But we've really ""properly"" been hanging out for about a month now. I am ok to take things slow but I would still like to do something nice for him to show him that I care for him without being overwhelming. I guess I want things to move forward a bit. The other day, over a call he complimented my picture too so the signs are there that he is into me. I just don't know how to move it forward a bit.  ",3,1730859353.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
