1hg0twu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1hg0twu/sitter_found_sleeping/,Sitter found sleeping,"TW: suicide

I myself am not a nurse but I’ve occasionally lurked in this sub because I used to work closely with nurses as an allied health professional. 

Here is my question: a family member of mine was admitted to a hospital after a suicide attempt. They were assigned a sitter in their room. Another family member was visiting and while visiting noticed the sitter had fallen asleep. They didn’t say anything to anyone, but they told me and I feel like this should be reported to the unit’s management as it could potentially be a patient safety issue. 

I feel like this could speak to a larger issue at the organizational level. The visiting family member recalled having a conversation with a staff member (may have actually been the sitter) about how short staffed they’ve been. I know hospitals are short staffed and overworked, but if a sitter is so tired they can’t stay awake in a suicidal patient’s room they, in an ideal world, should ask to be relieved so they can take a break/leave/grab a coffee. 

Or maybe this was just a coincidence and has nothing to do with hospital staffing, who can say? Maybe they were just bored and nodded off. 

I don’t blame this sitter. We are all human and have probably nodded off at not the best time at some point in our lives. But this could be a potentially dangerous situation for the patient. What would you do? Have you ever heard of a situation like this?",0,1734403576.0,nursing,0,0.33,False

She likes vintage 1960s theme so I’m going to ask her to a diner for some hot chocolate? I can’t eat in front of her yet and I think she is the same with me so that’s why I say hot chocolate. Coffee, all though it fits the diner would probably not be good for my nerves.

They are definitely living in the stove, but we see them in one of the bathrooms as well. Our theory is that they are in the building but are also quite established where we are.

We did the treatment where we emptied our entire kitchen out and the bathrooms and a pest company came and sprayed. The roaches appear to be laughing at this effort. So, I’ve bought so diatomaceous earth and some advion poison gel. 

Any other advice? We move out in February and my main concern is to not bring a bunch of stowaways with us to our brand new remodeled house. It’s insanely frustrating, especially since we are pretty sure the roaches are in the building and management seems to not care at all.

**Story so Far:**

* *Peanut officially joins the Starchasers*
* *Forgemaster Bvalinn agrees to make bullets and pellets for the team and will be discrete about it.*
* *Alchemist Knarru agrees to be the supplier for gunpowder and other related chemicals for the team.*

**\_\_\_**

**Autumnhollow, front lawn:**

“Baseplate, what’s the SitRep? Over.” Ingrid asked over the radio.

“*Starchaser, we're still Oscar-Mike to the hospital. Over.*” Zefir replied. He and the mice had left before Gwen, Peanut, and Sammy had driven their wagon out to the streets to do their shopping.

*“Oscar-Mike?”* Siria asked. She, Kinu, and Kvaris, and Viel had finished their business at Jordi’s Dismantling shop and were making their way to the market to rendezvous with Gwen and Co.

“Oscar-Mike is shorthand for ‘on the move’, one of the many military jargons for fast communication over the radio.” Philia replied, waving to Amalla and Kaolla who were also on their way to the market. The two wolian girls waved back, looking satisfied after seeing how well Ingrid could fight.

Philia then resumed tightening the screws. Ingrid had taken a hit during her sparring session, earning the wolian girls the right to observe the team’s adventures. Philia decided to have the monitor mounted to one of the stout wooden struts.

With one last twist, Philia tried jiggling the bracket and found it was solid. Cecil took the big flat screen monitor out of it’s box. Together with Philia they secured the monitor onto the bracket, both were satisfied at how solid the arm was.

“Still…” Cecil added, chortling as he did “...he finally said the thing! He got to say that Call of Duty line!”

“Zef’s on a roll today.” Ingrid giggled, she had just finished drilling a hole through the wall of the house. In a few minutes, she ran a flexible steel electrical conduit through the hole, this would serve as a protective tunnel for the electrical and ethernet cable that connected the gazebo TV to the house. She then pushed the conduit through PVC pipes, which were already buried into the ground.

Although Cecil was imprisoned inside his arcane dimension he was still able to extend a tendril and grab the cable halfway through. Ingrid waited until Cecil had secured the conduit staples before doing the same on the house’s wall. Then, she began caulking the hole in the wall.

The three of them picked up their coffees in sync and downed it, before Ingrid spoke up and said.

“Gimme a feed, Neith!”

 

Watching them were Mink and Roofe, who had just come in for coffee. They were joined by Farlan, Kirtus, and Cataline who had also come over to provide their reports of the village to Philia. The four of them watched in fascination as the three otherworlders worked quickly and efficiently over some unknown project. Ingrid, Philia and Cecil answered all their questions without any of the usual technical jargon.

“Information as you know is a powerful weapon.” Ingrid had told Kirtus when she was digging up the small trench that the PVC pipe would go into. “You’re all welcome to come and watch but… well you know how it is in a dungeon… it’s not a pretty sight at times.”

There was a faraway look in Ingrid’s eyes as her mind as all minds do, brought up unwanted memories. This time of the sight of the butchered and gutted tixi mice, heartlessly hanging over the cages of the still-living ones being kept for food.

“Thank the wolian girls for managing to score a hit against Ingrid.” Philia giggled as she carried the big TV, still in its box and laid it on the gazebo.

 

For some strange reason however, when they had asked Neith to activate the TV. The three of them groaned and moaned in pain and agony as if struck by some extremely malevolent curse, but they quickly laughed, as if accepting they were the victim of a very funny prank pulled on them. Energetic, catchy music began playing while the “Tee-Vee” showed a man with light brown hair and a striped tunic singing and dancing.

\_\_\_

**Meanwhile, on the streets of Teth-Odin:**

Zefir and the mice had yet to see the hospital where Iohann had taken the rescued mice to, but the fluffy sheep cleric had already gotten an idea of how Neith was able to tap into their Tac-Cams and Earpieces and told the sentient AI to track her location.

With that, Neith was able to work out the coordinates of the hospital. Using a combination of Iohann’s headset feed, tracker, and a scan of the map; it didn’t take long and Philia’s pride and joy was able to zero in on a good estimate of the hospital’s location and provide directions to Zefir and the mice.

 

As the team spoke over the radio, Zefir and his party made their way to the hospital along the main streets of Teth-Odin. The streets were wide and clean, the buildings quite tall. A row of gaily festooned poles held up faerie lights, which were carved into perfect spheres. These street lights stood at regular intervals, a metal dome was perfected atop the light-bearing crystal like an umbrella. When darkness fell, the highly-reflective interior of the dome enhanced the faerie lights’ luminosity, keeping the streets bright and cheerful in the city that never sleeps.

Merchant stalls spanned the whole length of every street block, one side facing the avenue of buildings, one side facing the middle of the street. It was broken up into regular intervals to allow foot traffic to cross from the outer lanes and inner lanes and vice versa. Zefir and the mice walked along the lane where the merchant stalls faced the central lane, further to his left was the center where pedestrial traffic merged with hooves and wagons.

On that lane a wagon on the road bearing the banner of Teth-Odin came to a stop, and a tamer with a tabard of the City Guard hopped out of the back, waving his hands rhythmically as slimes and jellies bounced out of the wagon and energetically began rolling along the streets, picking up garbage and dirt. Meanwhile street sweepers with brooms busily kept the streets clean as well, when they saw the slimes and jellies they piled up their gathered detritus so the creatures could pick them up.

Seeing them reminded Zefir why Cecil himself was an oddity; it wasn’t just because he talked and had that flying portal. Cecil didn’t have a “core”, a perfectly round sphere that was like the central organ of the slime. Cecil looked powerful as he lacked that one weakness and the only genus of slime that also lacked a core was of all things, an Elder Slime. Cecil also had a face, though Zefir had seen enough footage in the news to know that Cecil’s “eyes” and mouth were just as easily regenerated as any other part of him. “Ripping” Cecil’s eyes off was as ineffectual as holding one’s hand out to someone’s face for a few seconds to obscure their vision.

A big cube jelly the size of a cargo crate and a beach ball-sized core slid along the street, as it passed by a butcher’s stall, the lion-folk owner tossed the scraps over, patting the big jelly which seemed to respond to him by pumping itself up and down before continuing on.

 

While Ingrid’s slime friend wasn’t with him, Zefir still was gathering looks his way. The idea of tixi mice as familiars was unheard of. He had seen a few of them during his first year in Terragalia and he first thought of them as the helpful, friendly version of a raccoon with the clout of a capybara or an adorable fluffy dog. He had seen them help in farms and they were given food and shelter in return before the mice eventually decided to move on. Now that he thought of them, he figured that Saber probably decided to head to New Gorpisal to make themselves useful in exchange for treats and that was how they met Ingrid.

 

He didn’t know it as she had yet to tell the story, but the mice had followed the monster stampede of New Gorpisal, keeping their distance so they wouldn’t be made targets. When Ingrid showed up, the mice cutely waddled over to her, squeaking in a friendly way that melted her heart. The Starchaser quickly started making cute noises as she happily embraced them, and the rest was history.

 

Now there were fifteen of them, all decked out in lamellar armor and pointed helmets that made Zefir think what Genghis’ Khan’s elite crack squad would wear; sturdy and impressive-looking to let everyone know their boss had power. Dain (and later Bvalinn) made armor for the mice worthy of a Kingsguard. Strapped tight to one shoulder and held steady by that strap in one paw were their rifles. Nobody knew what they were but anyone with common sense could tell that the mice were armed, probably with some good but oddly-shaped staves. For the 189, it was their SCAR-H and M-14’s, for the Iroquois mice it was their AK’s.

Zefir himself was armed. For show he had his short sword hanging from his belt. A pistol was holstered under his open gambeson jacket and left armpit, another was holstered to the right side of his belt. Both of which were hidden from view. A FN P-90 submachine gun hung across his left shoulder and swung on his right side. To everyone else however, they only noticed the short sword’s scabbard dangling from his jacket, his main gun mistaken for some purse or maybe a potion pack. People walking around bearing arms attracted no undue attention, and so the mice at the perimeter of the group had their glaives out. Those on the left flank held their glaives on that side while the mice at the right side held their rifle straps with their left paw across their chest while their right bore the polearm, all of them courteously wrapped in cloth to avoid poking anyone’s eye out. It was like a cage had formed around Zefir’s sides and back as these mice rested their glaives over their right shoulder. Meanwhile the mice marching ahead of him held no glaives, keeping their rifles to their chest, Arthur stood between Zefir and the mice marching ahead, his snout buried on his smartphone as he observed the camera from Neith’s Aquila drone which observed the party from above, discreetly staying out of sight by staying close to the roofs.

 

Teth-Odin was definitely rolling in money due to the dungeon they had built underneath. It showed in the big busy main avenue he and the mice were currently walking through; the wide avenue was flanked by colorful buildings three to five stories high and not a single roof with dull faded paint, not a single wall with cracked plaster showing the rotting, dirty bricks exposed to the air. No, the roofs were all looking like they were repainted every few months or so, every wall looked like it was replastered or re-tiled.

“Let’s turn right, guys.” Zefir said as one very busy stall was being swamped by eager customers enjoying a kebab on skewers. Arthur squeaked in assent and the group slipped through a break in the line of stalls. They walked by a team of trolls humming along as they performed maintenance on the street-facing wall of one bakery, looking jollier than ever as the sun shined on them. Trolls in Terragaia were tall individuals, rather than turn to stone under sunlight, it invigorated more than a few of their sub-species while others it served as their caffeine or stimulant. All-in-all, every troll had to watch how much sunshine they were getting. A small smile curved Zefir’s lips as he suddenly had the mental image of a bunch of guys with a trowel in one hand and a bottle of booze in another. Most trolls were usually up and about during the night and until noon-time. Any troll seen at high noon was this world’s equivalent of some guy working the night shift. It was different however, for trolls who worked underground or mostly indoors, these folks followed the same hours as most other people.

 

At least the first two stories of every building in the avenue were clearly marked on the outside as commercial establishments; boasting grand signs, colorful banners, and many had overhanging balconies accessible from an outer staircase. Several extended their commercial space all the way to the third floor while the rest were either lodgings rented out or the homes of the business owners themselves.

He passed by a restaurant on a street corner. Two sides were made of gigantic brick walls, thought it was probably just a veneer, but the other two sides that faced the streets had no walls, only strong, thick pillars of harder-than-steel lumber held up the four floors above, a combination of Terragalian architectural technology and the existence of lumber far beyond that of Earth’s. He saw minotaurs, jodoves, and felmoons along with lizard-like sorians, nobody batting an eye as smoked carcasses of goats, sheep, and pigs hung on the wall. To him it was still puzzling to see, even though he had eventually come to the conclusion that a cow to a minotaur, an alligator to a sorian, and sheep to a felmoon was as removed to them as a monkey was to a human. He had once heard from Philia that in Arek’s homeworld, their equivalent of a Rickroll was a dancing gulan shrimp man grilling big shrimps while singing a catchy song, and in his planet, the space shrimp people saw them like pork.

Not that Zefir, or by his previous life as Dick Wood, would he ever consider eating a monkey, and while he was grateful he’s never seen a cat on the wrong side of the butcher shop, he had learned that a few of the meat he’s had came from this world’s equivalent of a big cat like a lion or tiger. A Var-Tiger to be exact, a huge thirty-foot super predator that needed to be regularly pruned from the wildlife census before they end up upsetting the local ecology. If he were to believe the stories; they were once the escaped pets of some aristocrat trying to look cool in front of his peers. He wondered if Ingrid would try to tame the first one she saw.

 

They passed through yet another intersection without needing to halt their pace. How the City Guards of any city manage to keep things flowing smoothly was a mystery to him, and he was grateful that not once did he and the mice ever have to stop and wait on account of some traffic jam or a deluge of wheels and hooves hurrying by until some Isekai cop blew their whistle for the perpendicular traffic’s turn to simulate a stampede.

As they walked by some of the vendors, they recognized Zefir on account of him coming along with the Enthana sisters days prior and waved at them. Zefir and the mice waved back.

Some of them jokingly asked if he had slept in.

“Y-yeah…” Zefir said, pretending to look shame-faced, “but it’s alright, because my job is to tend to their lodgings.”

“Oooooh…” said one minotaur lady selling fruits, her bovine rumble comforting, “so that’s what you kids call it nowadays…” she smiled as Zefir picked the best-looking pears and oranges he could find. He wasn’t sure what the mice in the dungeons’ diet was, so his other concern besides dealing with malnutrition was scurvy.

“Call what? Oh!” Zefir asked, but then realized she was insinuating that his role for that party of all girls was feeding both of their mouths.

He smiled and puffed his chest. “It’s an obligation!”

The minotaur laughed and gave him a discount.

**Meanwhile, at the Teth-Odin Grand Market:**

Kinu, Kvaris, Siria, and Viel had finished their business at Jordi’s dismantling shop, having settled for a good amount that would allow the party to rest and eat well for a week while doing nothing.

Upon hearing the figure, Ingrid addressed everyone on the radio.

“Does everyone find this acceptable?” Ingrid asked. “Iohann said there’s eighteen mice, and they all look enthused to join us. It will take a while to arm and equip all of them. While it looks like King Fish had made a lot of guns, they will need to be appropriately modified and trained.”

“It’s a good investment.” Kvaris said, “We can write to the guild regarding our paused activity.”

“We’ve done something exceptional.” Siria said “We’ve wiped out a whole nest and rescued many, a week shouldn’t hurt, and considering how more mice with guns would definitely help our fighting strength, I’m sure that guildmaster Tibbles will understand.”

“Pffft!” Ingrid was in the middle of drinking and was now coughing up from the coffee that came out of her nose “A-anyway, I hope it won’t come to waiting a week but I will prioritize King Fish’s well-being.”

“Kitty-Five and I can help with the enchanting work, it’s exhausting sure, but a fun and interesting process.” Siria said.

“Agreed!” Viel piped up.

“I can give it a shot.” Zefir volunteered “My hobby back in Ontala village also involved enchanting things, I’m no expert sure, but I see there’ll be parts that are easy to work this, I can handle those…”

“As do I…” Selphie added “King Fish uses mana-treated treantwood, that would definitely fall into my domain.”

“Thanks everyone.” Philia said, “But Starchaser’s right, let’s not hurry this process, it’s not about the speed, let’s do this accurately and safely. Alright?”

“In that case…” Ingrid said, everyone could hear the sound of her boots clomping onto the wooden floor of the gazebo and the coos of the larkirk doves. “I will personally write a message to the guild letting them know we’re taking a couple of days off to upgrade our equipment.”

“It’s settled then,” Kvaris said “We take the day off, prepare ourselves for a deeper plunge into the dungeon when we return.”

“Speaking of which, where are you headed off to now?” Ingrid asked as she began writing.

“Chapelle’s, an old war buddy of my old man. He’s got a shop here.” Kvaris said “Bvalinn’s already swamped with our orders for bullets pellets, and according to King Fish, more mice armor, glaives, and knives. Seeing as there’s shadow mice, I’ll see if I can find some weapons they can use to fight up close and personal...”

 

At the market, Gwen, Peanut, Sammy, Amalla and Kaolla, met up with the quartet from the dismantling house. The wolian girls had completed their sparring with Ingrid and were thoroughly impressed at her strength and skill. Now finished, they had hurried over to relieve Sammy after Kvaris said she wanted to bring her along to a family friend who dealt in weapons and armor. Philia had considered making an order for the mice’s brooches but decided that until Ingrid had come up with the names there was no sense making an order yet. As such, it made sense to have another smithy deal with the girls’ armor, and considering this was a good family friend to the Enthanas, Ingrid agreed for them to have their weapons and armor serviced there.

Chappelle’s Arms Emporium was a cozy-looking store occupying a corner. It was more of a high-end boutique, with many of the wares enchanted and all of them at the very least made to impress. The proprietor himself was at the counter, a scarred, one-eyed crocodile-folk who made a pleased guttural sound as he saw the pups of his dear wartime buddy all grown up and friends with what could only be the banner-rider of an orc tribe. After a perfunctory greeting and catching up, Chapelle made a genteel crocodilian rumble in this throat thoughtfully as Kvaris mentioned shadow mice.

“Amaduscia and I have seen such mice during our youth.” Chapelle told them. They all sat inside his office, enjoying the tea his secretary, who frequently had to deal with orders by letter had prepared “from what we’ve seen I wouldn’t say it’s not too strenuous but the cost of teleporting does have its limits and can exhaust the mice. I would recommend one such mouse to hang back and maybe use a crossbow and fight at a distance.”

“We currently have four mice that engage the enemy with glaives, appropriately shortened for the mice of course.” Kvaris told him. “but still long enough to let them fight from a safe distance. Our leader is currently considering the idea of having the shadow mice fight alongside these glaive-wielding mice.”

The crocodile thought for a while.

“If you’re interested I can, for a price, make pike-cleavers for these mice. I’ll even give you wands of duality on a discount and a free dagger to make it easy to stow away..”

“Pike-cleavers?” Kinu said. “You mean those really long greatswords you and father used in the battle of Lanfar pass?”

“Not the exact swords no, but one scaled down for the mice to use. Even then, it will still give them excellent range, just not as long as the glaives that you mentioned. For these mice I’ll craft a very heavy Orihalcum-Stellarheart alloy blade. I’ll give them a pommel that doubles as a Nixie weight charm, it negates the weight of the sword as far as it’s concerned with the wielder. To them, it’s as light as swinging a thin stick of the same length. For others trying to fence with the mouse, the sword’s weight still applies.”

“In other words, it’s like the mice have enhanced strength and weight when using this sword.” Kinu said.

“Exactly. Then on the rain-guard I’ll install a soulstone core, with a globe of protection spell on it. This allows the mice to charge in and start swinging with little to no consequence for a while, then, they can use their ability to teleport away before they get overwhelmed. The only question now is if you can train the mice to fight with them properly. I’ve never seen Tixi Mice use anything more sophisticated than a club or an axe they picked up…”

“Our mice can.” Kinu assured him. “Our artificer has developed some interesting weapons from her homeland and our mice have been fastidiously keeping them well-maintained. They’ve also practiced their fencing with each other with little prodding from us, they will learn to use these swords without issue, I’m sure.”

“Very well, now I just need to know how tall the mice are.” Chapelle said, Kvaris stood up and then lowered her open palm to give an estimate.

“I would say about this tall, let’s be generous and say a little lower than this…”

 

A couple of minutes later, the girls had taken off all of their armor and weapons for Chapelle’s best and trusted assistants to sharpen and recondition. As the garm girls and the crocodile-folk resumed catching up, Sammy touched her earpice and spoke quietly, giving Ingrid an update.

“Sounds pretty good.” Ingrid said “my original plan was to equip the shadow mice with shotguns. Take them. The combination of the globe of invulnerability, as you describe it, and the excellent reach of the sword, compounded by their enhanced strength and weight will make them excellent for cutting down multiple opponents while the protective spell holds. Before it runs out, the mouse can just teleport back behind the golden mouse clone and resume shooting.”

“Understood, we’ll have it done.” Sammy said. She looked up and signalled to the Enthana sisters. Kvaris nodded.

“Let’s have those swords done, and the wands of duality with daggers.” Kvaris said. “Anything special with them?”

“That’ll cost you.” Chapelle replied “But yes. Since you mentioned the ones using these are shadow mice, I have a soulstone I can install with the Misdirection spell. It turns the user invisible while creating an illusion of them moving in the opposite direction. The ones I have are quite of a dud, it’s a tricky spell to work with after all. It doesn’t last long but it’s fine; its true value is to allow the mice to quickly reposition themselves… now the price for all of that is…“

“We’ll take it. Make four of them.” Kvaris said, nodding as the crocodile smiled “These are worthy investments, also, you can make the blades a little longer since they can just instantly swap with daggers…”

\_\_\_

**Meanwhile, in front of the Church of Saint Ygris:**

While Sammy and the Enthanas were at Chapelle’s shop, Zefir now looked at the front gate of the Church of Saint Ygris. A metal fence painted black stood tall, highlighed by the towering bushes bearing colorful flowers. The gate was made of the same wrought iron-like material and yawned wide open, letting visitors come and go as they pleased. To the left and right of the entrance were two statues that looked straight out of a Japanese temple, two fierce-looking Nio-like guardian deities stared down at all entering and leaving, their expressions seemingly shifting depending on the viewer. The popular folk-story goes that all who pass by with a pure heart see encouragement and determination on their compassionate faces. The injured, sick and dying find their firm expressions one of mercy and comfort. Those who go with ill aim find their fierce expressions intimidating; warning them that such behavior will not be tolerated in this hallowed ground.

“Destination confirmed, calibrating map of Teth-Odin…” Neith said over the radio.

“Deviation?” Philia asked.

“Deviation?” Viel parroted, not understanding the context.

“A good ten percent, taking into account a lack of solid means to get an aerial view of the city.” Neith replied. “The map is accurate, Kitty-Five.”

“I see!” Viel said.

 

They stopped at a plaza across the street from the hospital, it reminded Zefir of the post-mass Sunday plaza back in his old hometown where it always looked festive on a mid-morning weekend in an attempt to catch the parishioners as soon as they flocked out of the church. He looked down as the mice started tugging at his legs and pointing excitedly at the food stalls.

Zefir crouched down and patted the mice who were squeaking something to him.

“You guys hungry?”

The mice shook their heads, but pointed at themselves and to the hospital, squeaking softly as they did.

A bulb went off at Zefir’s head.

Of course! He was lucky that he never needed to be in a medieval fantasy hospital yet, but he had a sneaking suspicion that this world probably was the same when it came to hospital food. After all, he had once sailed across the ocean several months ago, the destination was fortunately an island a few miles into the sea, quite visible on a clear day. The trip lasted a few days and just like an airport back on Earth, the port authorities were a soulless, humorless bunch who didn’t take too well to his attempts at small talk, earning him a gruff sigh from his Saint Bernard boss.

Smiling, Zefir got up.

“Alright guys! Let’s get some food! Pick what you guys want to eat...if the rescued mice see you eating them, then they’ll know it’s good.” Zefir said excitedly.

The mice responded happily, squeaking in joy and jumping up and down. Like excited children, the mice held his hands while others gently pushed him to the stalls, making the vendors chuckle in amusement as they saw the group. It gave more than a few the impression of excited children bringing their dad to them so they could have tasty treats.

1hg0ju9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1hg0ju9/consistent_normallower_blood_sugar_levels/,Consistent normal/lower blood sugar levels,"So I was diagnosed with GD only being 3 points out of range for both the screening and 3 hour test.

Finally got my glucose meter and 2 trials of A1C taken.

First A1C came back at a 6.0 and a 126 average glucose, aka lower end of pre diabetic. OB had me go for a NST at my last appointment and everything was beautiful.

Most recent A1C came back (a week and 3 days in between the last one) and it was a 5.7 and a 115 average glucose. Average glucose is perfectly normal and A1C was only 0.1% out of range. Barely enough to consider as pre-diabetic.

Anyways- my fasting level today was 85. I had slept in super late as I’m 37 weeks now and I’ve been sleeping a ton lately. Everything makes me tired.

Fasting was 85
1hr after dinner (had protein spaghetti and meatballs) was 98.
1hr after bedtime snack (had a whole green apple, peanut butter, almond crackers, cheese slices, and a decaf sugar free creamer coffee with whipped cream) was 104.

Is it possible I was misdiagnosed? That or is this just a very slim case of it?? I’ve actually struggled to eat as often as I should throughout the day and to meet certain carb counts. Could this have made me get it? This is my first ever pregnancy so I’m very new to it all. My baby is definitely a GD baby I was told, as she was measuring 7 pounds at 35 weeks. I have another ultrasound this week to track her growth and see what’s going on. Anyone have a similar situation?

I live with my family and my room is right next to the shared restroom so I originally thought it was that until I realized it was in the hall, kitchen and living room and even up the stairs heading to our apartment. On our floor there’s only our apartment and our Nextdoor neighbors and we are on the top floor of the entire apartment. 

We had a guy from the gas’s company come out and he said it smelled like something died. He said it did not smell electrical or gas related. He asked the downstairs neighbors and they reported smelling nothing. He even checked the only place in our building with gas which was the water heater. Other than that our own unit is all electric. The smell is only around the stairs leading up to our unit and inside our unit. 

My mom says it smells like poopy sewer stink. I think it smells like rotten bitter coffee grounds. It keeps getting worse. We have no real vents in our apartment except for above the stove and that one leads out to the roof for food smoke. I do hear animals on our roof in the spring and in the winter I can clearly hear the rain on the roof echo in the vent so I know for sure it’s open to the outside up there. We have already run the garbage disposal, cleaned the fridge, run water in our drains, and taken out the trash. My building was built in the 70’s so hopefully nothings wrong with it.

[GribStream.com](http://GribStream.com) is a weather forecast history API that provides fast access to both historical and real-time weather data from the National Blend of Models (NBM) [https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm) and the Global Forecast System (GFS) [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast)  It is fast, easy to use, leverages precise models and the pricing is unbeatable, especially if requesting data in bulk (same price to extract 1 or 1000 coordinates if within the same http request).

NBM model has a \~2.5 km spatial resolution and 1h time resolution, predicting up to 11 days ahead. (Only continental US at this point).

GFS model has a \~13 km spatial resolution and 1h time resolution, predicting up to 16 days ahead. (Global)

More models soon.

Example weather parameters:

* Temperature, dew point at surface and at different heights
* Wind Speed and wind direction at different heights
* Cloud cover
* Relative humidity
* Visibility
* Wave hight
* Tunderstorm chance
* Long/short wave radiation
* Pressure

   * Advertising. Adjust digital advertising content based on weather conditions; for example, promoting hot beverages on cold days and cool drinks on hot days.
* Photography Apps
   * Offer advice on the best times for taking photos based on natural lighting conditions, weather clarity, and golden hour times.
   * AI. You want to fake you went to Paris last week, what was the weather exactly? Don't make it sunny if it was pouring all week.

Go build it!

Please try it out and I would really appreciate feedback. What features would you be looking for? What do you think of the pricing? Are the docs clear? Should I improve the site cause it sucks so much you feel repeled to try the API? xD Should I support other models? Should I provide more APIs for other languages? Maybe an OpenAPI spec? Focus on features.

After forcing myself food the intake was about 270 calories for the whole day plus whatever calories were in my green tea and coffee. Before my cholesterol test I pretty much got my calories from drinks. I don’t know how I haven’t realized this before. I always got frustrated with how frequently my household eats only to realize that they’re actually eating when they’re supposed to… so now I guess I’m trying to fix it. I didn’t know that not eating increases your cholesterol as well so maybe that and the foods I would choose when I did eat is why I have the numbers I had on my test. Idk.

1hg0bnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1hg0bnx/colonoscopy_prep_at_the_airport_semiindepth/,"Colonoscopy prep at the airport - semi-in-depth experience for pre-prep, prep, and pre-op for someone who is as anxious as I was","I (29F) had a lot of questions before the actual procedure because I would be starting my doses at an airport and be on a flight while the it was coursing through me. Thought I should share my experience if anyone else was going to do the same thing and had questions or concerns, especially since this is the most extensive procedure I've had. I'll try to make this as short as possible.

Colonoscopy Prep (""Polyethylene glycol-3350, electrolytes, and ascorbate for oral solution"" by OCEANSIDE Pharmaceuticals - I have no idea what the generic name is).

Saturday - start liquid diet - tip: start when you wake up. Bone broth and lemon Jell-O makes you feel full. Gatorade for electrolytes.

Sunday - still on liquid diet. Went on a plane ride to another town for the day (I live on an island). Drink black coffee for appetite suppressant in the morn. Drink clear liquid (I had sprite, coconut water, and white Gatorade), and drink lots of it to stay hydrated and not be hangry later.

* Doctor said start prep at 5pm. I started at 7pm. If you have to start before a flight, start about 3.5 hours before boarding and be at the airport 3 hours before departure. Adjust according to you. If you're at a bigger airport then add an hour and drink the prep after security.
* Prep tasted like lemon/lime, a bit grainy, bitter aftertaste so I took sips of apple juice as a chaser.
* Tummy rumbles 30 minutes in, full waterhose at 830pm. Be near a toilet, but if you're used to diarrhea then it doesn't feel as bad. If you need to go, start heading there, but I wasn't running for my life nor was I camped in the bathroom. 
* What goes in will come out -  60oz of liquid in, expect 60oz of liquid out. Within 1.5 hours I felt ok to go through security and play some board games. Anytime I drank water, it came back out about 2 minutes later. I think if you haven't felt the need to go for about 30 minutes then there isn't a lot in your system. I wouldn't drink a lot of anything after - that's why I said drink lots throughout the day. I figured if you're taking your colonoscopy prep before a flight then be prepared for crazy things...
* Don't drink anything an hour before your departure time. When you get on that plane, keep warm and SLEEP! Go home/to the hotel and sleep some more.

Monday - colonoscopy check in at 915am - take 2nd dose at 5am, don't drink anything after 630am. Anything that comes out probably won't be clear, so if you're anxious about this, drink LOTS of water. This time be near the toilet. You'll go more often and your BMs will get more and more clear with a yellow tint, literally looks like pee. After an hour, or at 7am, I was able to go take a nap till check in time.

I think if I had taken the first dose at 11pm then I would have been pooping all night and wouldn't get any sleep until 630am.

For those who haven't had procedures like this before or haven't been put under anesthesia. 

* Have a friend or family escort you there and back (my hospital required it).
* If you're able to get pregnant, they'll make you do a pregnancy test.
* If you have piercings on your nose/lip area, take them out to fit the oxygen mask. Any other piercings, just be aware if they cauterize anything, there is a chance the current will go to that piercing and burn you. I kept mine in and they only cauterized one spot. Nothing happened. They might tape it down, or just make you take them out.
* If they have trouble finding a vein for your IV, they'll probably get the anesthesiologist to do it (happened to me, I'm a petite person and feint easily with needles).
* You'll be on your side (mine was the left). I was given a pillow to hug and one for between my knees.

And that's it! You'll wake up not recalling anything and the nurses and doctors will explain everything else for you!

Very brief symptoms/backstory: 

Always constipated before June 2020 - went on a camping trip, water came out every single time I ate 5 bites of anything. Thought: giardia? Not giardia - never went to doctors cause I had no insurance. Got better after 2 years, but BMs became yogurt-y and diarrhea spells every other week. Also could not eat anything before noon or else nausea and/or water poops... Nausea worsened a few months back, had acid reflex, throwing up, no appetite or just felt queasy after thinking about food. Rice and popcorn made my but into a firehose and apples made me throw up. All blood test results showed high eosinophil count, and low vitamins and neutrophils. Friend who has UC planted the idea that I may have some form of IBD.

We met in college and have had a really good relationship so far. Still somewhat in that honeymoon phase I think. We both aren’t from our college’s area and went home for winter break. His family lives down at the beach and they have an awesome place to just unwind in the winter. My bf invited me down and said they would buy my plane ticket and pick me up and all. I agreed and we scheduled and booked my flight there. It was my first time traveling myself so I was super nervous. My bf has a job back at home he works for experience and extra income. So when I landed his dad was nice enough to pick me up from the airport. 

It was just my second time ever meeting him but he was super sweet and very kind to me. He ended up stopping for me to get coffee since I got in early morning. After that we headed to my bfs place. His house was insane but was sad he wasn’t home but working when I got there. My bf’s dad brought my stuff in the house and was greeted by his mom. They grabbed my stuff and showed me my room for the stay. Which sucked I wanted to stay in my bfs room lol. But oh well I’m grateful they had me at least. 

When my bf got home finally we ended up grabbing food and hanging out. We had a very nice rest of the day as he took me around showing me his home town. 

The next day my bf headed to work just for a shorter day and wouldn’t be too long. I woke up and had some breakfast with his family. His dad offered to take me out on the boat afterwards while my bf was working so I wasn’t bored. It was a gorgeous day and it’s a boat so I wasn’t saying no! I got changed in a cute bikini and headed out with his dad on the boat. We had a really nice time as we stayed in the backwater for a little while he showed me around and then we finally went out into the ocean. When we got out there we hit some waves which was super thrilling. He was worried I’d get sea sick so we found a spot and just idled. I got up on the front of the boat where he had a pad for tanning or lounging. I ended up laying down and trying to get my tan on as he was vibing to his music and relaxing. 

After a little he came up and sat with me and talked about life. College, the past, his son and just pretty much everything we could. It was super nice to actually talk to my bf’s dad. He got up from sitting and as he was walking back he told me it was okay if I wanted to get rid of my tan lines. I asked him what he meant and he was said to not feel bad if I wanted to take my top off and fully tan. I awkwardly laughed and said I was okay. 

We kept talking when he came back up front and he ended up telling me again it was okay to go topless and fully tan. He claimed every girl including his wife will tan out in the water topless to get an even tan. Again I laughed and tried changing the topic. 

A few minutes later he brought it up again and was explaining how he didn’t want to come off wrong but just wanted me to feel comfortable and feel like I was at home. I sort of understood what he meant so I ended up slipping off my top. I could tell as I did he was trying not to look but I did catch him peaking. He offered me tanning lotion and sun block. I said I was okay and just laid there tanning as we talked a little more. 

We soon ended up having to head back as my bf was out of work soon. I put my bikini top back on we headed back in. I haven’t told my bf about it but I don’t know if it’s weird or like bad. Nothing happened and he wasn’t like creepy when I was topless. ",0,1734401939.0,confessions,7,0.2,False

What the heck are these scammers getting out of this? Do they see any of the money? Does Aliex release funds to the stores before confirmation of received??

I am taking care of myself, have all the hobbies, a robust social life and am maintaining all of that.  I’m just not happy being shackled to the limitation of not dating until I’m over it.  

On top of that, I’m wasting time.  I want a family etc and I’m expected to wait 6 months to a year to get back out there?  I’m craving my ex that doesn’t want me, suffering with no end in sight.  I have a good life otherwise, I just want to hang out with other girls and see what happens but I’m not over it at all and still feels like day 1.

It's 40-minute kaleidoscope of samples, loops, noise, campfire strumming, guitars, and random detritus I picked up over a weekend of recording with an old friend. It's very chill, surprisingly cohesive, and a bit stoney. If you've got the time and the inclination, here's the link. Thank you very much.

[The Album In Question](https://mediaexploitationcenter.bandcamp.com/album/dead-air)

VL;BSR

Greetings, fellow purveyors of the strange and unlikable.

Since the early/mid 90s, me and a friend have been making noise. Back in the day we put out a tape. Maybe made a few copies. Played a coffee house in Manteca a couple of times, a book store in Livermore, did a spot on SF's The Pain Factory that never aired. You haven't heard of us unless your name is Monte or Moe or Dustin, Denis, Dave, or Keith. And even then, it's not a guarantee.

For the most part, we were just happy to get together a couple of times a year and ruin some old turntables, detune our guitars to death, push our meager delay and distortion pedals to their limits (for me, a Boss PS-2 and a DOD Thrash Master) with mics and power tools. Like how some friends get together and play basketball down at the park. But we sucked at sports, and sucked at making normal music. Luckily we came across Nurse with Wound, Master/Slave Relationship, Merzbow, Crash Worship, NON, and other acts that let us know that we didn't need to know our scales. 

What a goddamn relief that was!

So we leaned into making a ruckus. And a ruckus we did make. 

We took time off due to life here and there. We moved, left the country for a spell, reconnected, and when possible, made some goddamn noise. In the past two years, after a break of about 7 years, we got back together with a bigger arsenal of sonic weaponry and a better handle on how to somewhat direct the chaos. And goddamn if we didn't end up sounding like...music? Well, we no longer were pumping out sonic, unhinged ear-fuckings, anyway. There's a place for that, don't get me wrong. But we had done that and were aiming for something new. We recorded our live jams for the first time and they were, dare i say, good.

A few months ago we set out to spend the weekend playing off of one another, utilizing looper pedals and an array of synths, samplers, tape players, guitars, modified tape machines, and a small fortune in pedals. We'd set some loops off of one another then sit back and let them work within and around one another for about 15 minutes, enjoying the branches and routes that loops of different lengths took. Then we'd stop them and do it all over again.

At the end of it we ended up with about 6 hours of material to work with. So I went into the lab and took and blade and some tape to the stems (digitally) and this is the result, a 40-minute hallucinogenic hayride into the chill zone. It's the quietest we've ever been, but also the most musical. My goal has always been to make music that I want to hear, because Lord knows no one else wants to hear it. With this, we have succeeded. It's pretty rewarding.

So if you've got 40 minutes to kill, then please give it a listen. We didn't reinvent the wheel or anything, but we did manage to make an audio document that we are both incredibly proud of and will serve as a reminder of a very specific moment in time when everything was right in our world. We had some good weed, some delicious beer, a host of toys to play with, no neighbors to complain, and a friendship that has lasted something like 30 years. 

Thank you for reading the Very Long;But Still Read if you did. If you didn't, I don't blame you. 

Keep being weird, friends. It's the purest form of expression. No one may ever hear what it is you make, and that's fine. Create for you, first. If anyone follows, cool. If not, you will have still been true to yourself. If you're not regularly listening to the music you create, then why are you making it?

1hg06yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Santeria/comments/1hg06yf/found_interesting_videos_of_my_dad/,Found interesting videos of my Dad?,"So a little context, growing up my dad used to have a Yemaya statue that had shells, candles, and coffee and liquor. Also several necklaces around the statue. He would always send me after school to go get candles. I forgot what the colors were, i believe they were blue, white, and maybe green? I remember him telling me about her as a kid and how important it was for me to get the candles and give her coffee every morning. Before he passed he brought me to his friend who gave me a necklace that was orange in color. I was 10 or 11 at the time so i dont really remember. But i later found out through context clues that he was my dads babalow. 

Edit: it was more than just giving me a necklace, he prayed over me and did some other things but my memory is blurry of the exact events 

Im 23 now and approximately 3 years ago i found a harddrive of his with a few cool things on it, but one of the things on there was a video  of a fruit basket with a bunch of offerings on it, that then pans to my dad dressed in all white from head to toe, at the beach alone, sailing this basket into the ocean, and i believe he also threw other things into the ocean. (i need to source this video again because he was speaking to the camera) 

This video and certain memories of seeing my dads friend and his bizarre house, mixed with getting things for yemaya everyday, always has made me curious about what path my dad was on. The harddrive has been on my mind a lot lately. If anybody can provide an insight id appreciate it. ",2,1734401530.0,Santeria,0,1.0,False

1hg0499,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hg0499,Christmas box’s for neices and nephews ,"Just a few box’s I made for my neices and nephews this holiday season from scrap wood. 

#1 is white oak with mitred corners and continuous grain wrap, and a suuuper figured big leaf maple top insert.

#2 and #3 are made from the most highly figured piece of maple that I have ever seen, I tried to do mitred grain wraps on these also but the amount of figure caused the sides to warp a bit so instead of having gappy 45°s I decided to do rebates instead. And the black epoxy holes are from trying to use Amazon barrel hinges and them falling apart after install (lesson learned. Always buy quality soss barrel hinges).
so I decided to use old and trust narrow brass hinges instead.

#4 is an offcut from a coffee table I’m working on which is western big leaf maple with a walnut piece in the top and bottom for the lid and base.

#5 is a little bit of figured walnut and repurposed skateboard to form the frame on top of the inside lid, and as added thickness for the screws from the hinges because I accidentally went a little to thin while splitting and planing this 4/4 material. But I think it turned out good for a last minute scrap project for kids. 

Everything was sanded up to 180 then used “saicos satin hardwax oil”, after 12 hours I lightly sanded with 320 grit to make everything soft to touch and used saicos hardwax again for 2 coats for a total of 3. Everything feels like a smooth rock.
 
All in all I think it went well for a scrap wood project.

I made this account awhile back with the intended purpose of sharing my very extensive experience with this thing we all love and appreciate, farts! However plans changed and I became extremely busy, I’ve been working in film for almost 20 years so there are times when all my focus is put towards my work. Currently I have taken some time off for the Holidays so here I am to finally tell you all my story. 

Let’s see, where do I start? So, I’ve had this fetish for as long as I can remember. Don’t know how I got it to be quite honest but I do know for many years i was not sure if I was even normal. I wasn’t attracted to girls the same way my friends were, I was only interested in the farts, something I’ve only told a small handful of people as of this writing. For awhile I thought I was gay. Then when I watched for the first time as a teenager I figured I was asexual. Then in my early 20’s something shifted. A spark was lit out of nowhere and I began to just start saying “F it”. I like what I like and it is what it is. That’s my story and I’m stickin to it. That’s the moment I can say that I officially became me. Which brings us to now. I have a Vice, and that Vice is women’s farts. Some people have drugs, others have video games, I have a gas obsession. For the past five years I have been feeding my appetite by paying women to accommodate my fetish. The stories I’m about to tell you are real and I have no reason to lie. I’m eager to share with you all these very cherished moments. Each story will feature a girl and I’ll just detail the who, what, when, where, and how’s



Esmeralda

I met Esmeralda in 2019, the year I started this journey, September to be exact. Coincidentally I made this account on my five year anniversary and was planning on posting this then. Anyway, I discovered Esmeralda on Instagram. She was Latina, a little younger than I preferred, and though I wasn’t initially sure what she did for work she certainly fit the bill of what I like. Latina businesswomen. Couldn’t really tell you, everybody’s got their somethin right? I was on a following spree of women who fit that aesthetic and Esme was one of two individuals who followed me back. I was more attracted to Esme so I sent her a DM. We talked for awhile and got along quite well..in the beginning that is. Now I should warn you, it didn’t go quite as planned. I didn’t know what the heck I was doing so I just went about the whole thing all wrong. I wasn’t rude or aggressive, just didn’t work out. Suffice to say Esme blocked me. 

The next morning I saw that Esmeralda had unblocked me. Not only that but she had sent me another message. Come to find out she was an insurance agent at a multi level marketing company, however she was only getting paid off of commissions and wasn’t making much. She needed the money and she also happened to be a single mother of a small child. We negotiated and we both agreed to one another’s respective requirements. Esme lived close by so we met up the next day at the library. She was very quiet, rightfully so, we hardly knew each other. She remained this way for the entirety of our meetup, though she laughed and joked here and there. I wasn’t expecting to get anything out of this “hangout” right away but I remember being so horny and I had been pent up for so long. I was ready for the farts. However I understood that this was a feel out test and i was fine with the circumstance. 

After the first meetup, Esme and I agreed to meet again, this time for the real thing. Esmeralda told me during one of our conversations that she was lactose intolerant so for our next hangout we went for some pizza at this restaurant near then, Staples Center, now Crypto.com Arena. One other thing Esme informed me about was that she looooved to eat and I got to witness this firsthand. She chowed down on slices of pizza, artichoke dip, breadsticks, calzones, pasta. My feedie fetish was being fulfilled right before my eyes and I hadn’t even told her that part(coming soon). 

In the midst of this hearty dinner, Esme accidentally let out a deep burp. I mean it was certainly on the bassy side. I could tell she was embarrassed but we both laughed it off. It was soon after that when Esme told that she needed to fart BUT, she didn’t wanna do it in the restaurant but she REALLY needed to fart. Now in a perfect scenario I would’ve wanted her just do it right then and there but I understood that she was new to this, and for the most part so was I. My ex of three years was the only woman who had ever participated in my fetish for me up until that point. I didn’t know what to say, I wanted the farts but I also didn’t want to force her to do anything she felt reluctant to do. Esme decided to excuse herself and run to the bathroom. I was a little.. you know..she came back and I was like sooooo? She was apprehensive to admit it. I asked her if she actually farted while in the restroom. She said yes. I wanted more out of her but I left it at that. Esme would go on to admit that she needed to fart a couple times more but she held it in. I guess she remembered how much I was willing to pay for her farts and decided to play along. Once we finished our dinner we took a long walk to the parking space. We got in the car and it was sort of a “now what” situation. It was awkward at first but we started getting to it after Esmeralda revealed to me that she had held in her farts all the way to the car. I told she could’ve let ‘em out during our walk and that I was into that. We both learning as we went along. Upon asking where we should do “it” at, she was surprised when I told her we could just do “it” right there in the car. She said something to the effect of “but your car is probably gonna stink”. I had to remind Esme that I didn’t care and that whatever gross shit that came out of her I was up for. 


Finally, the time came. Esme sat in the passenger seat next to me. Light blue jeans, brown ankle boots, a denim jacket. She was looking pretty hot that night. As we both sat waiting for that first fart to come, my anticipation was through the roof. You know that feeling when you’re really “excited” and it’s like you’re almost numb, you don’t feel anything? You can’t even feel your heart beat? Yeah that’s where I was in that moment. Not gonna lie, once that first fart bubbles out from beneat Esme’s ass I could’ve um “blank” right then and there. Not trying to be crude but this part of the night gave me lots of feels let’s just put it that way. Esme let out two more super rumbly farts that just BUBBLED into the seat. I had to tell her to just sit firm in the seat and let ‘em out as I liked that cause she kept lifting her cheek to try and push. I LOVED that sound. LOVED that freaking sound! Describing it doesn’t do it justice. But I hear it right now. 


The car did indeed start to stink, pretty good actually. It was RIPE. Like hot cheesy diarrhea. Probably the best way I can put it. We sat in that car for I don’t even know how long as Esme just launched fart after fart into the seat. Apart of me kept thinking “wow this is fantastic and all but sooner or later this girl is gonna have a major accident if she hasn’t already”. I’m omitting the embarrassment and the laughter that ensued in between cause it was a lot of it, Esme didn’t exactly know how to take in the whole thing. She spent much this “session” with her face covered in her sleeves and her head turned to the window. I appreciated her though, she was a trooper. It seemed like the longer we sat, the more gas Esme developed. Just when we thought she was done, more farts would rumble out. I went into this night not knowing what to expect, even expecting to get very little in return, but yeah wow, I got more than I bargained for with this one. She was practically burning a hole in the seat, as well as in the atmosphere that surrounded us. The smell was DI-GUSTING. For those of you who have never experienced farts, especially at this level, it can be a lot. Both of us had to leave the car a couple of times. Esmeralda’s prediction surely came true as my car stunk for a while, like longer than I thought. You know when you have food in your car, let’s say some take out, and your car smells like that food at least for a day. That’s what Esme’s farts did to my car lol


I was okay with the farts going on for as long as possible, despite the fact that the air I was inhaling smelled much like raw sewage. However Esme needed to go, like immediately. She told me she quite literally could not fart anymore cause whenever she pushed she felt something extra. She also needed to get back to her son who
was being watched by her mothe. On the way to taking her home I contemplated telling Esme about my poop fetish. I got greedy, very greedy. I wanted to see the aftermath, like in a big way. That’s when I decided to just come out with it and Esme’s reaction was what I expected. She was grossed out and was surprised that someone could be into something like that. She kept asking “why would you wanna watch me do that” “why would you wanna watch me do that”. I apologized and left it alone. She then said something like “you would have to pay me way more to do something like that” I was like wow, I totally forgot to even mention to her that I would in fact do just that lol. So I told her. I’ll pay you more. I didn’t have it at that very moment but I was willing to go the extra mile, even if that meant driving to the atm. Esme still wasn’t that into it. I compromised. Asked her if she’d be willing to at least make a video. I noticed her demeanor change. She was considering it. She asked how much more. I told her to give me a number. She wanted another $200. I said deal. Long story short, I got the double double that night


Esmeralda: Later

After a few months of Esme being my very own personal fart queen, things looked a lot different in November than they did in September. Not only did we build a friendship but she had grown so much within the fetish. I mean it was like night and day. Sending me videos without asking. Telling me stories involuntarily. Being down for petty much any scenario. The biggest thing we had done up until this point were public farts. Something she even told me herself she never saw herself doing cause she said never farted in public. One thing I’ve learned about this fetish and dealing with partners, and I figured this out during my relationship with my ex, is that trust goes a long way especially when it comes to women. When they feel like they can trust you, like really trust you, it’s a different ballgame entirely. 

Something I had been wanting to do since meeting Esme, well since forever really, was sniff a woman’s farts while she wore her business attire. Esme obliged as long as I kept my promise to pay to get her laundry done which I had been doing since our third in person session when she realized that her clothes-mostly just her pants and underwear- were getting stained from the farting. Also, she didn’t want to wear the clothes she wore to work so I had to buy her new ones. After our third session Esme and I had started doing dirty butt/unwashed activities like facesitting, seat sniffing, jeans/panty sniffing etc. but we had never conjoined the two. I wanted to change that. Farts and dirty ass was my request and whew was I putting a lot of dough into this thing but it was well worth it.

Esme arrived to the motel I booked, wearing her outfit that she had been in all day, per my request. She had done some shopping so she had been walking around all day, not to mention she had been phoning in the hygeine, also per my request. Esme showed up the door looking so hot and so perfect that I almost couldn’t believe what we were about to do. Never once did not get butterflies before, during, and after every session. No matter how many times, it always felt like the first. You just never get over that feeling. Esme told me that she really gassy after eating mall
food and some ice cream( I rarely made food requests, I’d just let her go with whatever she knew would get her going, to anyone reading this the way to go as everyone’s body is different and some may not respond to certain foods the way other’s will). I asked Esmeralda if she could her farts for a few moments as I just wanted to sniff her ass for awhile. We started off with her standing up as I got down on knees and deeply inhaled the crevices of Esme’s checkered dress slack-clad ass. I could only really smell anything if I got my nose directly up there. Even still, I mostly just smelled new clothes, the pants had a “right off the rack” stench to em. I wanted more so I went for it. I told Esme I’d give her twice the amount of she pulled down her pants and spread her cheeks so I could sniff her hole. We had a no touch policy in place as well as a no nudity clause. Esme thought about it. She wanted me to clarify that it was just her ass that I wanted, I told her yes. She pulled down her pants to just below her cheeks before spreading em. Now THAT did the trick. I went in and inhaled. So very musty and musky. I could feel a bit of dampness with the tip of my nostril as I felt my way around the area. 


Eventually it was time for the farts. Esme happened to accidentally let one slip I was sniffing her anus which got me insanely horny so went went ahead and got down to business. Esme pulled her pants back up and proceeded to fart a couple more times. The smell was strong, but not as pungent as it would be as we continued. This was a common theme with Esmeralda. She would fart and it once she started there was no stopping. The gas was just pile on and have no choice but to be released in the exorbitant amounts. 

I made sure Esme got in as many positions as possible. Seated, doggy, lying, bent over, squatted. This kinda became our thing during our sessions now it’s the norm for me whenever I do this. Each position came with a round of gas. Different sounds. Sometimes airy, other times bassy, there was the occasional “ripper”. The fabric of the dress pants made some really dynamic sounding farts I gotta say. Never was I not surprised by how much gas this girl had. Again, everyone’s body is different. My ex was not like this and other girls I’ve had sessions with have been less naturally gassy than others no matter what they ate. Esme could just let ‘em fly. The smell would become more impactful as we went on. Started out being a stench just from a fart, to a lingering odor, to a longer lasting lingering odor to eventually the entire room smelling super rank. I had to ask Esme what exactly she ate cause some of those odors were freaking indescribable. She said Chinese food. I can only assume that combined with the ice cream was what was behind those unbelievable aromas. Esme would often stink herself out, she only did this with me so farting that much and that odorously would send her running for cover. She’d usually leave the room and take a break, I’d just sit there and bask. Who can relate? 


After much farting Esme told me that she had to stop as she was close to going on herself. I asked her if she had to “go” at that very moment. She said that she did. Her being lactose the dairy would always do it’s job right. Again guys, I got greedy. I asked Esme if I could watch her go in person especially since I had the motel for at least until the next morning. She asked if I was willing to pay more, I said absolutely. I had an extra $100 in my pocket and I agreed to do another $100 after I went to the bank. Esme agreed and she went into the bathroom to “do her business”. It was HOT. Her dress pants at her knees, pushing that stuff out. Anyway, I know I know, I won’t go into too much detail on that


2020 & Covid 

So Covid happened, aaaaand yeah, that was pretty much the end of what I had going there. It felt like the end of a lot things to be honest. The world. The industry I’m in. Esme and I did some sessions in Jan and Feb but of course we had to stop. I paid her to do some videos for me but it wasn’t long before I just couldn’t throw out that kind of money anymore. More important things needed to be prioritized. I spent so much on girls. Not just Esme but others. I wasn’t broke but it’s not like I’m really Scorsese either. Once I couldn’t work that was that you know. Esme and I remained in communication. Sending each other positivity during that time. However it didn’t stay that way. Eventually we just stopped talking. In Dec of 2019 we had made plans to visit Texas in the spring as there were some interesting ideas I had for us to do. Of course that never happened 

2021

It took me until the Summer of 2021 to really get back to where I was before. I began working on a project in the fall of 2020 which brought me a lot closer to my original positioning 

2021 And Excess

So I didn’t learn my lesson. Not one bit. I told myself if I have the money, I’m gonna get what I want, no matter what. I began messaging girls, countless girls. I mean I practically took up a second job as a professional DM’er. I went as far as to creating burner accounts of burner accounts. I even started talking to women who were outside of the state. Texas, Florida, even one in Canada. Everyone from fast food workers to professional dommes. I had successfully mastered the art of the Dennis Rodman “Work Hard, Play Hard” philosophy. I was, and still do, split my time between working and sniffing farts/talking to women. A few of these women happen stand out during this particular era. I began talking to a woman in Florida named “Julia”, who was an aspiring country artist. Small social following but a ton of talent. She was into BDSM among other kinks but never had done anything involving farts. That changed when I paid her to send me a video of her farting in some jeans and cowgirl boots. My “relationship” with this woman sparked my country western kink. Julia was pretty open and took to the fetish fairly well. She was okay with messaging me about her farts, when she farted, what they smelled like. She always said that they smelled like eggs. She’d send me a video and tell me something like “these were so nasty, they smelled like rotten eggs”. It would get me so, just, MAN. I needed to see Julia in person. However during this time she was headed to Alabama to visit family so I had to wait. Once that was over, she went back to Florida to unwind. Finally she agreed to come out to LA. I booked her flight, the hotel, and picked her up from the airport on a sunny Friday in August 2021. Julia was very attractive to me. Anyone watch The Challenge? You know Laurel? She resembled her in both face and body. She had that big and tall build, curvy but somewhat statuesque. Only difference is she had long blonde hair and tattoos. She was sort of “alt presenting” but was a country bumpkin to her core. Accent and all

I got incredibly turned on when Julia told me had farted on the plane and it really stunk. She also farted while in the car. I was amazed. Julia had that kind of bubbly personality to where your expected her to be like that but it was still pretty crazy to watch her be so open. And yes it smelled eggs, she wasn’t lying. 

For that entire weekend, Julia and I would go out, i I’d take her to see the city(she had never been outside of Florida or Alabama), she’d fill up on lots of food and we’d come back to the hotel. She’d then fill me up with all of her gas. I wanted her to wear her country outfits. Jeans, boots, hat. The whole nine. It really turned me on. I remember just lying there as she sat all on me, I’d take in her full weight, just being engulfed in her gas. This is an experience that, you just can’t put it into words. Feeling someone’s body as you receive the fumes that emanate from within it. It’s UN-REAL. Julia was another one who was just naturally really gassy. She could fart nonstop. And no matter what she ate, they’d smell like eggs. I have no clue what that was a thing but it was a thing. Julia’s farts would happen at all times of the day too so being in such close proximity to one another made it possible for me to get every bit of it. She told me that she never in a million years thought that she would fart this much around a man. She had become so conditioned by the “girls don’t do that” narrative and had gotten so accustomed to holding them whenever necessary. Not the guest or last time I heard that from the women I associate with 

After my hangout with Julia I began talking to a woman whom I began following on social media. Definitely my type. Latina, older, had done some small plus size modeling work but had a day job as caretaker. She was round but curvy, I loved her fashion style, a single mother of two boys. We’ll call this woman Griselda and she had some of THEE most ruthless farts I had ever smelled up until that time. Griselda wasn’t interested in the fart thing until I told her just how much I was willing to pay. One thing I’ve learned from all the years of doing this is that, as slimy as it sounds, everyone’s got a price and in this economy who couldn’t use the extra money especially for something so simple as farting. Griselda was one of those people. Didn’t understand it but was okay with taking the money. She was also an empath and would sometimes make me feel a bit guilty about how I was spending. She’d say things like “don’t you wanna put all this money towards a worthy cause, something charitable?”…

Something I loved about Griselda, besides the farts, were her voice. I started off paying her to do “fart talk” on the phone because she wasn’t ready for the in-person stuff. She just had such a perfect voice for that. I always encouraged her to do voiceover work, even for a project I was involved in. Griselda was also older and in a field that required a certain kind of communication so she’d use the words I liked to hear. 

Once we began doing in person stuff I went from being enamored with Griselda’s voice to being totally obsessed with the smell of her farts. She warned me ahead of time, multiple times, that her farts were really really stinky. She was certain that I’d want out upon first sniff. She was right that her farts were incredibly stinky but wrong that I’d b**** out. The first time we had a session, she farted once and it stunk up the whole motel room, no joke. It lingered for minutes. MINUTES. I had no idea how she had such disgusting gas. Then she told me that she had been having stomach problems since she was young. She listed all the conditions she had then it all made sense. Despite trying to eat right, it did little to contain the smell. Griselda would fart and fart often, so during our sessions I’d not only be nauseous from the smell but also the fumes would stay with me for days. Sometimes now i’ll still get whiffs, they’re like war flashbacks. 

I happened to get a chance to inhale Griselda’s fumes while she had really nonstop gas just due to her condition. Her kids were with their dad so she came up to the motel I booked and just completely gassed out the place. There’s something…surreal about being in a single room that has been bomber by UC farts. That was the first time I had ever felt like I was gonna pass out during a session. I hung in there but she stopped to use the bathroom. I went right to sleep after and would wake in and out of sleep feeling the need to run to the toilet. 

I had become so immersed in my own fetish that I stopped creating limits for what I was willing to do as far as receiving pleasure. I did the unthinkable. I began talking to a guy. He was what some refer to as a “femboy”. I’m into trans women but i had never been with one at the time of meeting “Jerrell”. Man, okay, first time really sharing this with anyone publicly. So I met Jerrell in September 2021. Where? Well on Instagram of course! Trust me, I’ve met fart partners on other platforms it’s just that IG has worked a lot for me for some reason. X, formerly Twitter, too for a little while. I’m usually very honest about what I want when I talk to people so once I told Jerrell what I was liking for he was in. He was a wannabe influencer, had a YouTube channel, wanted to pursue acting even knew some people in the business. Very high maintenance and very gassy. He liked to stay in shape so working out was one of his favorite hobbies. This resulted in some pretty rank protein farts. Something I had experience with but Jerrell was just..different. Jerrell, who lived nearby, would workout, have his protein garbage, and then come to me(one of the few people I’d have at my place) and give me his farts. Sometimes they’d smell like straight up sulfur, other times like eggs and some kind of green vegetable. Very pheromone heavy. I was attracted to everything about this. I didn’t care. I had watched guy fart porn before when I’d find myself in the mood so I wasn’t completely against the idea of sniffing farts from a man however knowing that I’m not gay, it was still a..different experience. 

Not only was Jerrell a gassy protein addict but he also has stomach problems but wasn’t sure what exactly as he never got it checked out. He once told me that he’s “always blowing up the bathroom”. He’d fill me in on his fart chronicles and tell me how they smelled. It was also very humorous and colorful. I liked the way he talked about his gas. We started doing sessions at each other’s places. I’d go to his, he’d come to mine. I remember going into the bathroom and there were piss and poo stains pretty much all over the toilet. It was..eye opening 

There was something just erotic but sniffing Jerrell’s farts. I’d love for him to be just in his underwear and facesit me. He could go on and on and on and they were always SO DAMN LOUD. He had an apartment so sometimes I’d get kinda you know..like..I’m pretty sure your neighbors are hearing ALL of this. The smell would hit so hard. Man farts sure pack a punch. 


Stephany

In summer 2022 I began working on a project that required my to temporarily move to Houston, TX. This was around the time, I’d say about month after, I had really cranked up my dealings with fitness girls. I had working relationships with three simultaneously and I couldn’t get enough. I sometimes go through these phases and it’s all dependent on just where I’m at during that time period. I was so into protein farts that I began paying the women I was working with to UP their protein intake. The farts were horrid but I threw limits out the window long before this. When I arrived to Houston I didn’t know my way around, like at all. Didn’t know the area one bit. On this particular project there were stunt doubles, and a couple of those stunt doubles were locals from the area. I would go on to befriend one of them and they helped me out a lot with finding my way around the city. Her name was “Stephany”. An extremely fit Latina in her late 20’s who could fart you under the table. Funny story. 

So we’re on set, it’s me, Steph, some crew, some cast. We were talking when all of a sudden this just putrid, rotten odor began overtaking the air around us. We were in a somewhat enclosed space, only the rear of the set was right out through an entrance way. So the stink was just festering. Everyone was pointing, laughing, playing the blame game. It wasn’t until after filming wrapped for the day that Steph would reveal to me, in confidence, that it was her who let off the stink bomb. I was like OHHH F*** YES! I joked with Stephany that some people are into that. She laughed. I said some people actually find farts to be pretty hot. She went “REALLY?!” I subtly worked my to telling her what I was into and what my intentions were. She was never really agreed just made some jokes about how I would love her farts cause they stink so much or how often she passed gas. I decided to just flat out ask if she’d be willing to do it for the right amount. She told me she’d think about it. Some days passed and Steph found herself in a bit of a jam. She told me that she went out with friends the night before and her card got declined, apparently she was a heavy slender. She told me how embarrassing it was to have to let her friends pay for dinner after she had already agreed to cover it. I hear things like this a lot, especially in my industry. People spend and spend until it all comes back to bite. I’ve really tried to manage my money properly, I can honestly say farts are the only thing I pay top dollar for. I have one car, one house, and I haven’t bought new clothes since Trump’s first term. 

After Stephany’s financial revelation, I decided I’d help her out. I got her card situation taken care of and put some money in her account. It wasn’t a “I’ll do this only if you do this” type of thing either. She was my friend and I wanted to be there for her. HOWEVER, when she told me that she would repay as soon as possible I turned her down. I didn’t want her money, I wanted something else. 

Stephany would give me her farts whenever she felt the need while we were around one another. They were POTENT. Always. Even the slightest toot was enough to at least roll down a window. I recall being in the car with Steph on our way to lunch and she ripped one, it was so small you could barely hear it but wow was it strong. 

I can also recollect huffing Stephany farts as she bent over in her tight workout shorts, just inhaling nothing but toxicity as these satisfying puffs just seeped out of her ass. They could’ve knocked anyone, not totally initiated into this lifestyle, OUT. I mean these were insane. Is there something higher than “rotten eggs?” Cause these were a step above that. It smelled like she had eaten 10 eggs. Even if I had my nose up to her ass, without even farting, I’d still smell all the farts that had been clouding the back part of her shorts. I was hooked man, I can’t say it enough. I’d go onto link up with a few other fitness girls in the Houston area after and during this time. Shoutout Alphaland


2023: Houston women & Influencers 

2023 was when I began traveling more during my off days. I rarely would leave the house, hated it to be honest unless it was for work. Same went for traveling. I’ve been places, a lot of places, but it was never something I really aspired to do. That changed when I was pushed by friends to go out more and see the rest of the world. Once I did this I was met with so many incredible experiences, of course many of them involving farts. 

I really loved Houston. I went back again after working there in 2022 and just really took a liking to the city. That’s when I met Erika. A 30 something Latina who worked as a tax consultant. We met the old fashioned way. At a bar while watching an Astro’s game. The bar was pretty crowded so there were very few available seats. Erika walked over and asked if the seat beside me had been taken. I answered no. She sat and for some reason I just felt compelled to chat her up. She was so easy to talk to and we just started talking. The two of us instantly hit off as we got to know one another in between cheering and hi-five’ing. She asked me what I did and I told her. She said that her younger brother was an aspiring filmmaker. She goes “I’m texting him right now” she begins telling me what she’s typing out “I’m with this guy right now who does movies, have you ever heard of _________?” This made me feel pretty awkward, I get it, she was probably trying to secure a “connection” for her brother but I don’t know it was sort of..anyway. To my surprise, he actually did know who I was, or he was lying lol. Either way Erika got him on FaceTime and turned to me going “here, here, take it”. I was like uhh. I went ahead and talked to him, it was kinda loud so I could barely hear him. Nice guy, I forgot to get his information though. The night goes on and Erika and I end up having a blast. Astros won. We exchanged numbers and said Goodnight. I drove back to the Airbnb I was staying at sort of conflicted. Erika was a cool person, I’m fact I was very surprised that she was single given how great of a person she seemed. But I know relationships are not for me. I couldn’t lead her on. I had to find the right time to tell her that I wanted stat friends but I’d be willing to give her whatever she wanted in exchange for what I wanted 


The moment came a couple days later when Erika actually called ME. I was the one waiting for “the right time” and.. I guess she chose it for me. She happened to be on her way home from work. We talked until she arrived back. Once she got in
and our conversation continued I decided to tell her the truth. Her reaction made me pause for a minute. “Farts?”…”Okay??” It was the tone tho. It sounded like any interest she had in mr was just gone right at that moment. I was fine with, I’ve gotten the rejection plenty of times before but i really wanted Erika to fart for me. Especially after following her on Instagram. She had the businesswomen aesthetic that I love. Was a big change up from the jeans and Altuve jersey that I met her in the first night we crossed paths. Even when i told Erika that I’d pay her for the farts that didn’t change her tune much. In fact it probably wasn’t a smart move at all. She implied that I saw her as some kind of prostitute which wasn’t the case at all. I had to do my best to wiggle my way out the corner she had backed me into. Long story short I managed to find a way. Somehow she went from “You like farts???” To “Lol You like farts? That’s hilarious but also kind of interesting. Listen you gotta know how to talk man, that’s all I’m gonna say.


Erika was a coffee addict, which meant that her farts could light up a Christmas tree. She would always telling me how gassy she was at work or how she had to hold in a fart during a meeting. One time she told me about how she accidentally farted while taking with a client and it stunk but neither one acknowledged it. I love hearing things like that. I always encourage the women I work with to feel free to share whatever stories they may have. Sniffing Erika’s farts was great because not only would they stink but she’d be in her business attire as well. It’s sometimes weird revealing how much I love this cause it’s SO NICHE and SO SPECIFIC but again, everyone’s got their somethin. What can I say? I had left Houston for a while to get back to work but returned soon after. I had missed Erika and wanted to her her really gassy just to fulfill those urges I had. I remember her telling me a story of how she ate Indian once and was farting nonstop for literal days. I didn’t believe so I wanted to see it for myself. I took her out to this Indian restaurant in town and it didn’t take long until she was telling me how she already was feeling gassy. This woman would proceed to rip ass in the car the entire ride back to the place I was staying at. She kept apologizing but I had to remind her, hey it’s okay, keep going lol. Some were silent, others were audible, each one was RANK. Just RANK. I could smell and taste them, the spices, mostly that curry. Jeez. It was like she kept pressing a button and suddenly the car would fill with noxious fumes. This continued at my place. I had her sit on a chair and just blast off. She wore these tight grey dress pants and I swear whenever she farted with her ass poking out, I could see like fluttering of the pants from the fart wind. She really stunk up the place. 

Erika would later introduce me to some of her friends as she was aware that I was looking to buy a house in Houston. She had friends in tax, in real estate, in brokerage. She connected me to a lot of fine folks. Before I knew it, I was a member of the community, albeit an honorary one. I also wound up with some newfound fart partners. Each one was in Erika’s circle of friends, all in the same or similar field. The fart thing was a secret we kept amongst one another. One in particular happened to be my real life estate agent, Veronica. Beautiful woman, curves, dark flowing hair. Her farts weren’t the craziest but there was one time where she met one off that smelled really rotten. She had just had dinner with friends and I invited her over. She ripped one that smelled like something her insides were rotting. Apparently red meat really does it for her. Not much happened after that one fart. You’ll run into situations like these plenty of times

It’s officially been 3 days since I was kicked out of college and rendered homeless. Good news is that I managed to get into a shelter the night of, but unfortunately it is shutting down very soon due to lack of funding.

There were comments on my original post suggesting strongly that I join the military, and that was something I was highly considering. I did a tiny bit of research, and it is most likely I would get disqualified due to medical history. I really do not think I have the mental fortitude anyways. Job hunting is still no luck, even with grocery stores or coffee places. The area I’m in is very bad, I’m always being bothered or harassed by drug/alcohol addicts which is very frightening to me. Just the other night this guy drove up to me while I was reading in a park, trying to coerce me into getting into his vehicle. 

I’m south side of Seattle which I find to be very scary, especially at night where I’m forced to wander around a lot. 

It really feels like when I take a step forward, I get knocked two back. As of now I have no idea what to do. I’d appreciate any kind of advice if there is any to be given. Thank you :)",5,1734401113.0,Seattle,1,0.86,False
1hg00un,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hg00un/coffee_with_an_ex/,Coffee with an ex? ,"
Four years ago, I (25F) broke up with a dude (25M) largely because he was moving countries for work. Him and I had been together for nearly five years and were best friends before becoming lovers. The breakup was super abrupt - far more so than I would have wanted - but basically, Covid restrictions separated us and then things ended on the phone. He moved out before I came home, and I’ve never seen him since. We’ve never really messaged one another out of respect for each other’s space. But I’d say overall, it ended on good terms. 

Recently he (now 29M) moved back to the country, and back to his hometown. He’s been hanging out with some of our old mutual friends. I’m (29F) now in a happy relationship of three years, living in a city way south where I work my dream job. But this week, me and my current boyfriend happen to be visiting my ex’s hometown, partly for work and partly to see those mutual friends. We’re staying just a mile down the road from my ex. And being so close has stirred up all sorts of unexpected strong emotions that I’m struggling to understand.

I’ve avoided going too close to my ex’s house so far, or any social events that he’s at - but for some reason I just really, really want to see him. To ask him to catch up (totally platonically of course) over coffee. I don’t know if he’d be interested, or how my current boyfriend would feel about it. Of course I wouldn’t message him if it was uncomfortable for my boyfriend at all, and I would understand if he didn’t want to see me. But I’m just SO damn curious to recall what he’s like and hear how he is. It feels like this enormous part of my life disappeared in an instant, and I don’t know if I’ve ever really had closure. It’s so sad to think I might simply never see him again. 

What can I do to quell these feelings without crossing any lines? What does it mean? Am I actually over him or am I kidding myself? Has anyone else ever found peace and closure in a catch up with an ex? ",1,1734400991.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1hfzz7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hfzz7a/sf_the_messiah/,[SF] THE MESSIAH,"The air backstage was thick with the scent of hairspray and anticipation. A frazzled makeup artist dabbed at the scientist’s forehead with a powder puff, muttering something about the relentless shine of studio lights.

“Hold still, Dr. Kael, or I’ll make you look like you’ve been dunked in glitter,” she warned, wielding the puff like a weapon.

Dr. Kael sat hunched on the edge of the makeup chair, one hand gripping a steaming cup of coffee that read *“Trust me, I’m a physicist”* in peeling letters. His suit, a shade too big in the shoulders, bunched awkwardly when he moved as though he’d borrowed it from someone with broader ambitions. Even though he knew that was well-nigh impossible. See, Dr. Kael wasn’t just a scientist; he was a symbol. The kind of figure whose name echoed in classrooms, boardrooms, and bedtime stories told by parents to children who dreamed of making the world a better place.

His first Nobel Prize came at the age of thirty-eight when his revolutionary therapy rendered cancer—not a disease to be fought, but a genetic misstep to be corrected. His discovery was hailed as nothing short of miraculous: a treatment so precise it rewrote the language of cells, coaxing them back from the brink without the invasive touch of surgery or the harshness of radiation. The world wept with gratitude, and Kael became the name on everyone’s lips.

But it was his second prize, just five years later, that cemented his nickname. Using a method no one fully understood but everyone hailed as genius, Kael found a way to create sustainable, nutrient-rich food from little more than air, soil, and sunlight. It bewildered the best and brightest humanity had to offer. Hunger, once humans' oldest and cruelest adversary, was rendered obsolete. Whole nations were lifted from the brink of famine. Economies shifted, a significant number of wars ended, and for the first time in centuries, the concept of a truly fed world seemed possible.

The media latched onto the moniker with unrelenting fervor: *“Dr. Messiah.”* Kael hated the nickname, but he understood its appeal. Who else but a messiah could walk among humanity, solving problems that had plagued it for millennia? The irony wasn’t lost on him either: the world clamored to deify him, while he worked tirelessly to show them that their greatest salvation lay not in him, but in their own ability to change.

“Glitter could be fun,” Kael murmured, half to himself. “Might distract from the fact I’m about to tell an entire planet their clocks are lying to them.”

The makeup artist paused, raising an eyebrow. “Yeah, well, don’t tell them that before the commercial break. Producers hate it when guests break reality too early.”

Kael smirked, it still surprised him how no one noticed–even this close to his face. “I’ll do my best.”

A production assistant with a headset appeared at the doorway, waving frantically. “We’re already behind schedule! Dr. Kael, you’re on in sixty seconds!”

Kael rose, brushing non-existent lint from his sleeve as if the action might shake off the weight of his thoughts. The corridor to the stage stretched ahead of him, lined with cables and boxes marked *“FRAGILE.”* He adjusted his tie—crooked, of course—and took a deep breath.

“Okay,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. “Just another day explaining the fabric of the universe to people who think time is what their phone says.”

The assistant walked briskly ahead, mumbling into their headset. The muffled sound of the live audience filtered through the walls, a blend of laughter and polite chatter. It reminded Kael of white noise—something in constant flux, just like the universe he knew so well.

As he approached the edge of the curtain, he caught sight of Ryan Mellows through the gap—smiling, confident, leaning back in his chair like a king about to welcome a jester. Kael chuckled softly. If only they knew who the real jester was.

Mellows radiated the effortless charm that had made *The Ryan Mellows Show* a late-night institution. With his signature mix of wit and curiosity, he had a talent for drawing people out, turning even the driest subjects into must-watch television.

Once a rising star in investigative journalism, Ryan had traded fieldwork for the bright lights of the studio. His audience adored him for his knack for asking the questions no one else would, wrapped in a casual delivery that felt more like a conversation with an old friend than a hard-hitting interview.

Mellows thrived on variety—one night a Hollywood A-lister, the next a groundbreaking scientist. Tonight, though, even he felt the buzz in the air. Dr. Kael wasn’t just another guest; he was a living legend.

The makeup artist called after him, “Remember to smile! And don’t touch your face—it messes with the powder.”

Kael raised his coffee cup in a mock salute before taking a sip and handing it off to a random usher darting around backstage. “Noted.”

The stage lights flared as the curtain parted, the audience breaking into applause. Kael stepped forward, squinting slightly against the brightness. The warmth of the lights contrasted sharply with the chill in his gut.

“Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we have a guest who’s not only a genius but also probably the only person who understands my producer’s obsession with deadlines. Please give a warm welcome to Dr. Gabriel Kael!”

The audience clapped enthusiastically as Kael walked onto the stage, waving with an awkward yet endearing smile. Kael shook the host’s hand as he settled into the armchair across from him unabashed.

“Good evening,” Kael said, his voice calm and measured. “Let’s talk about the one thing that makes you late to work and early to worry.”

“Dr. Kael, you’re here to talk about time, but we’re already running late. Should I be nervous?”

“Don’t worry,” Kael grinned, “I’ve stopped clocks before. You might have a few extra seconds left.”

The audience chuckled, instantly warming to his quirky demeanor.

Mellows leaned forward, intrigued. “So, time—big topic. Let’s start simple. What is it?”

Kael clasped his hands, tilting his head in mock contemplation. “Well, Ryan, how do *you* define time? Is it what your watch says? The ticking of a clock? The rising of the sun?”

“For me, it’s mostly when my producer says, ‘We’re out of it.’” He answered, eyes widened comically, his mouth stretching into an exaggerated grin as he swiveled slightly toward the audience, eyebrows raised in a silent cue to laughter–which they obliged.

Kael nodded, visibly impressed, “You jest, but you’re exactly right. It’s an abstraction—a tool humans invented to organize their lives. A sundial measures shadows, not time. A water clock measures flow, not time. And even your fancy digital clock... it’s just counting numbers. Change. That’s all it is.”

You could now feel the palpable curiosity of the crowd in the air.

Kael continued, leaning back slightly. “Now, the most precise clock known to man is the atomic clock. It measures the vibrations of cesium atoms—exactly 9,192,631,770 vibrations per second.”

“That’s a lot of vibrations. And you’re telling me that’s still not time?”

“Not time, no. Just movement. Like I said, *change*. Now, here’s the million-dollar question—what happens when there’s no movement?”

“Everything stops?”

Kael leaned forward; his tone serious but playful. “Precisely. That’s what we tested.”

The audience was now visibly hooked.

“My team and I invented a room capable of achieving absolute zero—the coldest temperature in the universe. At absolute zero, atoms stop moving entirely. It’s theoretically impossible... well, it was until we did it.”

“So... what happened?”

“We placed an atomic clock inside the room. And it stopped. Time,” he paused, as he gestured air quotes with his fingers, “didn’t pass in the room, even though it continued everywhere else.”

The showgoers began murmuring amongst themselves. Ryan stared wide-eyed. “Wait. Are you saying you broke time?”

Kael smirked, “Not broke it. Just found where it hides when it doesn’t want to play.” He shifted gears, his tone growing more and more reflective, “Humans think they’ve mastered time—sundials, water clocks, atomic clocks. But it’s all based on cycles and oscillations – real, tangible, physical phenomena. The sun rises and sets. Water flows. Atoms vibrate. But what happens when there’s no sun? Or twin suns? What would a sundial measure then?”

“Sounds like the world’s worst tanning schedule.” Mellows laughed.

“Or maybe... the perfect one, if you’re from there.” Kael leaned forward as Mellows looked at his audience, visibly confused.

“Dr. Kael, you’re starting to sound like you’re from another planet.”

Kael grinned as his voice softened into something incredibly sincere, “I’ve been on this planet for 3,212 revolutions around its star. See, where I come from, time is less of a line and more of a... sphere. Your measurement tools wouldn’t work there. The atomic clock, maybe. But we don’t have cesium. Your curiosity, though? That’s universal.”

“Wait—‘where you come from’? Are we talking metaphorically?” Ryan asked as he began to move his chair back in anticipation of an answer he both did and didn’t want to hear.

Kael sat back, his eyes twinkling as he placed his index finger on the mastoid process behind his right ear, feeling for the module beneath his ‘skin.’ “Oh, no. Quite literally. But don’t worry—your Earth clocks are adorable.”

He felt a tiny click, and his ‘skin’ began to flicker. The synthetic material became transparent, revealing the richly green derma underneath. The material was weaved into thousands of hexagonal shapes, blanketing his green cuticle, and making him appear reptilian to the human eye. He peeled a similar synthetic from his face, leaving bare a visage that eerily resembled that of the mythical demons that had plagued the human psyche for millennia.

Dr. Messiah stood and observed the chaos that had begun to unfold around him. Ryan’s chair fell empty, some people in the crowd had run out of their seats in a panic, while others sat frozen in awe - or maybe it was fear?

He looked straight down at one of the cameras, whose operator had passed out behind it, “I never really liked the name Dr. Messiah, but the irony of it always made me chuckle. I *did* come down from the heavens, and my prerogative is to save humanity from itself. Your understanding of the universe is too one-dimensional. It’s limited in scope – everything is from a human perspective, even when you have the technology to abstract more nuanced points of view. It *will* get you all killed. If you’re going to venture out into the cosmos – that cold and dark void, many things are going to have to change.”",1,1734400863.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

No one loves me, I'm completely alone.  I have no friends.  No one gives a fuck about me.  It's true, if I died it wouldn't make an impact on a single persons life. I'm genuinely a worthless piece of shit.  What a fucking idiot I was to think that a single person on this earth would ever be attracted to someone as grotesque as me.  I am seriously so unintelligent that I genuinely thought I had a chance, I text her she texts back I ask her out to coffee- ghosted.  Stupid of me to think anyone would want to be seen in public with an ugly freak.  I seriously thought I had something going for once, I'm glad that I was rejected early by being ghosted instead of insultingly shot down.  This is why I just don't try anymore, the pain of rejection leaves me in an irrevocable state of despair for weeks at a time.... after all the hardships and obstacles I survived and overcame to make it through this year, finally getting a good job and getting my shit together it all feels hopeless and pointless... Every year for the past 3 years I told myself if I don't have upward momentum in life with my career and relationships by my birthday that I'm going to knock my rotten brain out my ears and into a trash bag.  There is no hope, there is no rescue, I am lost at sea and there is no lifeline.  When someone is drowning in the deep ocean, the only thing they can hope for is someone to save them...  They do everything they can, they tread water, they swim, they try to float but at the end of the day if there is no one willing to save them, they will drown.   And since no one gives a fuck about me and the chances are they never will, all hope is lost for me.  I am only 28 years old, I can't continue living like this for another 40-50 years alone with no one to be with, a foolish, unloved beast devoid of happiness.",1,1734400663.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

We started talking nitong november and then he asked me agad agad kung pwede bang manligaw and I said yes naman. Then a week palang na nanliligaw siya dinadala na niya ako sa condo niya

1hfzvz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphicteestore/comments/1hfzvz3/best_skinny_net_worth_tee_by_graphictees_a/,Best Skinny Net Worth Tee by GraphicTees: A Fashionable Take on Financial Culture,"In a world where personal net worth and financial success are often the center of conversation, the **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee from **GraphicTees** humorously taps into this mindset with style. This graphic tee offers a tongue-in-cheek nod to the obsession with wealth, making it a standout piece in the fashion world for those who appreciate a clever play on words and financial humor.

In this article, we’ll explore the cultural appeal behind the **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee, why it’s trending, and why it’s a must-have for anyone looking to make a statement about financial success—whether ironically or with swagger.

**The Meaning Behind ""Best Skinny Net Worth""**

The term **""net worth""** refers to the total value of someone’s assets minus their liabilities, often used as a measure of financial success. People are obsessed with calculating and comparing net worth, especially when it comes to public figures like celebrities and entrepreneurs. But what does ""skinny net worth"" mean?

The phrase **""Best Skinny Net Worth""** brings a playful twist to this concept. Rather than celebrating wealth and riches, it humorously highlights the idea of having a modest or even minimal net worth, embracing financial humility or poking fun at the pressure to be wealthy. In a world where net worth can define status, this shirt delivers a witty response to that obsession.

Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur, a budget-conscious shopper, or someone who loves to joke about the unrealistic expectations of financial success, this tee speaks to you.

**Pop Culture and Humor in Fashion: Why the Best Skinny Net Worth Tee Stands Out**

Graphic tees have long been a platform for cultural commentary, humor, and self-expression. The **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee perfectly captures that balance, offering a lighthearted take on the serious topic of money. Here’s why this design stands out:

* **Clever Wordplay**: The tee’s clever play on words turns the concept of net worth on its head. Instead of celebrating wealth, it embraces the reality of having a “skinny” or smaller financial standing, making it relatable for the average person.
* **Minimalist Design, Big Impact**: The design is simple, typically featuring clean typography that ensures the witty message is the star of the show. This minimalist approach allows the words to speak for themselves, drawing in attention for the meaning behind the phrase.
* **Versatile and Relatable**: Whether you're someone with an actual ""skinny"" net worth or you're simply amused by the cultural fixation on finances, this tee makes for the perfect conversation starter. It appeals to people across various demographics, from students and young professionals to entrepreneurs and even those in the finance industry.

**Why the Best Skinny Net Worth Tee Can Rank High on Google**

Getting your **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee ranked high on Google involves targeting the right keywords, optimizing for search, and tapping into trending cultural conversations. Here’s why this tee has all the potential to be a top-ranking search result:

**Popular Keywords Related to Wealth and Finance**  
Terms like ""net worth"" are highly searched, especially when it comes to celebrities and entrepreneurs. By aligning with these high-traffic search terms, the **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee taps into a popular cultural conversation around money and success. While ""skinny net worth"" adds a humorous twist, it also makes the shirt more unique and easier to rank for, as it targets a niche, low-competition keyword.

**Cultural Relevance**  
The **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee is both funny and relevant. As society continues to obsess over wealth, social status, and net worth rankings, this tee offers a playful commentary on those cultural values. Products that tap into real-world trends and conversations tend to perform better in search rankings.

**High Demand for Graphic Tees with Humor**  
Shirts with clever, humorous messages are consistently popular in the graphic tee market. The **Best Skinny Net Worth** tee capitalizes on this demand, making it an ideal candidate for high rankings when people search for ""funny financial tees"" or ""net worth humor shirts.""

I used to be so good with people. I used to look at everyone with love and compassion. I really liked other people. I remember when I was younger and living at home, I would sit in my living room window and drink morning coffee in the sunlight. I’d look outside with such…joy. I felt content, comfortable. I wished only good things to others. That is all gone. I haven’t felt that way in a while. I don’t feel joy at all anymore. I don’t even feel sadness. I just feel…bored. And numb. And if it’s not those, it’s anger. I hate everyone. People kinda stay at a distance from me because I’m just so negative all the time, and always complaining. 

Im so tired of feeling like this. I want to be better. I need my spark back. I’ve tried anti depressants, and all they did was destroy my sex drive. Is it even possible to feel emotions again? I’m so numb. 

But what if feelings emotions again is worse? Maybe numbness protects me.

Below is the first third or so of a story I’m developing. I hope you all like it. 

Greenstick

April 30

I’ve come across a question I’m afraid to ask. 

The answer might cast a light on things I’d rather not see. Things I always chalked up to bad luck or just the way things are. I often noticed that things seemed out of place, or slightly off. It always seemed like it all could be traced back to the coma, like drops of blood combining at the edge of a drain. 

The moment that fractured everything. When recalling any memory became as difficult as seeing through a shattered window. I write this here because I feel like I can’t trust myself to remember anymore. I write this here because I could hardly ever read my own handwriting, a problem that makes the question ever harder to solve.
 
The question, like a scream in the dark down the hall on a peaceful night, is unwelcome. I wonder if I should just close my eyes and wait, and hope I’d never registered it at all. 

The question.

Why can’t I remember writing The Abandoned House?


May 1

I’ve realized I need to share everything here. I’m not sure if I’ll remember everything the way it really happened if I don’t. Or if it won’t make sense when I do. 

I almost thought it was an April Fool’s joke at first. At the premiere of a film based on a story I’d made, The Burn Pit, one fan stopped me not to ask for an autograph or for my opinion on how they’d butchered the ending. She looked at me with a pair of bright green eyes that seemed to shine as she asked, “I’ve always wondered, what happened at the end of The Abandoned House, really?” 

I couldn’t help but pause. Occasionally, someone gets a title wrong, slightly altering a word or two in something I’ve written. But this title brought nothing. I felt like I was peering out into a wall of fog as I searched for any hint of it. I told her it wasn’t one of mine, and her expression drifted into something more than disappointment. Something close to resentment. 

She wandered off, yet the question lingered with me. The title, The Abandoned House. It felt like something I’d write. It was like finding an old picture you’re in and being shocked you can’t place what, when, or where it was. I felt that place in the back of my mind begin to work, synapses firing and connections forming. The feeling when a new story is forming, already beginning to fight its way out. 

A quick search on my phone as I left the theater while walking to my car left me frozen in place. There on the internet movie database was the title The Abandoned House, released September 23, 1997.

And beside screenplay, my name. Matthew Rook. 

May 2
I woke up last night dripping sweat. I haven’t had a chance to look up anything else. Or maybe I haven’t had the courage. But this story keeps clawing at the corners of my mind. Normally, I’d never hold back that wonderful burst of inspiration. But this is different. I had to write something, and this is what I found on the screen after an hour of furious typing. 

The Abandoned House

Loneliness is not found when no one is around. It comes when you realize there's not enough left of you to share if there was. 

Pale amber light pours in from one of the holes where the roof had admitted defeat, a beam glistening across a cracked bottle. The structure bends and creaks in the wind now, begging for the day it will be overwhelmed.

A black rain begins to trickle down from above, heavens weeping now at what they saw. The mold metastasizing throughout the walls gleefully drank and continued to creep into every corner.

Once, laughter had filled the walls that now only harbored the blackest moss. Arguments had stained the air, drifting into cold silence that would seem searing compared to the state it was in now. The growth had infected the smallest room, worst of all, infiltrating the yellow paint and gradually overtaking the crib in the corner. It had never been touched after the day the laughter died.

I am what remains.

I am a shadow in the dark. The last gasp of a scream no one ever heard. A hand that cannot hold. A memory of a dream dissolving into dawn.

I am what remains in the husk of a home no one could live in.

Far too late, I realize there's not enough left to save. 

This isn’t how I normally write. But this is what has bubbled to the surface. Now that I’ve shaken it loose, I’m going back to sleep. Maybe tomorrow I’ll look this movie up. 


May 3
 
I can’t sleep anymore. I wake up and the story screams behind my eyes, begging me to work on it. Some part of me almost hopes I can finish this draft before I do find the movie, so I can see which turned out better. I found myself typing this morning, cold coffee sitting beside me only growing colder.
 
This is what I’ve made so far.
 
The Abandoned House
 
The bottle slipped from his hand across the filth covered floor, rattle echoing through empty walls. For a moment, his hazel eyes fell on it and searched for shards of shattered glass. Then he laughed—a hollow, rasping sound that fell off the peeling paint throughout the home.
 
Of course it didn’t. He thought to himself, though he could not place what that made it so funny.
 
He hauled himself to his feet, swaying as the room began to tilt. A layer of grime cushioned every footfall, the accumulated decay a soft and strangely comforting. The flickering lights offered little clarity, sputtering in and out of existence like a memory just out of reach.
 
He fought through unsteady steps as long as he could until one foot landed wrong. The fall knocked the air from his lungs, but the impact did not feel the way it should have. Instead, the weight of the house pressed in on him as he laid on his side—the damp rot, the stale air, the relentless quiet. He laughed again, the sound sharper this time. He searched the floor for his phone, though he knew there was no one he could call.
 
Nobody would answer. Not for him.
 
A gust of wind cut through the room, unexpected frigid air kicking up dust and debris as it squeezed in through every broken window and crack in the walls. He squinted into the dimness, trying to pinpoint its source. He told himself he would check tomorrow, though it was another lie.
 
The fridge groaned, a low, mournful sound that echoed through the kitchen. He was not sure why, but the interruption left him started. He shuffled toward it, fumbling inside and pulling out the one thing it still offered. Another drink.
 
He unscrewed the cap and tossed the plastic over his shoulder, unbothered when it came to rest silently. The whiskey burned his throat in a way that felt familiar, almost comforting. He sank into a corner of the room, shadows embracing him like an old friend.
 
Kyle closed his eyes and tried to remember how he had ended up like this. For what felt like hours, he sifted through dead memories, though none of them seemed to fit. The house creaked and groaned around him, alive in ways he could not be. When he opened his eyes again, the illusion of warmth was gone.
 
Leaves drifted through the shattered windows, dancing through the otherwise still air. The fridge door hung open, its insides empty and silent. The bottle in his hand was dry now, though he did not remember drinking the last.
 
All that remained now was the house.
 
Sitting back, I stare at the name the longest. I usually labor over them, struggling to find the one that sounds right. That has some personal meaning that isn’t too obvious. But like the rest of this story, it simply appeared.
 
Its like I can’t stop it.

This is just something that happened about two weeks ago that’s been in the forefront of my brain for a while. 

So about a month ago I broke up with my partner of about a year. We both started our first semester at college and as you can imagine long distance just took its toll. Obviously out of respect for my ex and simply because it’s only been a short while since we broke up, i’m not ready for any sort of date or relationship nor do I want one. 

I met this girl who we’ll call Demon about a few weeks back. Every time we spoke it was just small talk. I didn’t really feel any connection to her since we didn’t have much in common but she seemed to like talking to me. She asked me about shows I like to which I told her about Arcane (good show rec) and then she suggested we should watch it together some time. I kinda brushed it off because I’m a little shy and didn’t say much about it. The next day she texts me asking if we’d wanna go get coffee (i’m a slave for coffee) and then watch the show together. I didn’t want to say no since she was nice and I was looking for new company to have around campus. So what the hell, sure. However, I did specify that this was a FRIENDly meet up and it would be nice to get to know her as a FRIEND. She said of course and that she understood. 

When the day came everything was fine at first. We went to a local coffee shop using the campus busing and she offered to pay for my coffee. I thought it was a little weird since we’ve never hung out before, but I thought she was just being nice since it was her idea to go out. Should’ve been my first flag. It started snowing pretty heavy out and her two roommates came into the coffee shop and told us the buses were down for a bit because of the weather. The four of us decided to go back to her house until I could get on a bus to go back. Normally I would never go to a persons house on the first meet up but seeing as two other people were there and the cafe was closing, I didn’t have much of a choice. When we got into the house the two roommates suddenly just left and said they were going out. Great. So now I’m all alone with this girl and watching the show I recommended. Sometime about an hour in she moves directly next to me and puts her hand on my thigh and starts rubbing it near my private area. It takes me about five seconds to fully realize what’s happening before my body contorts up and I start stumbling over my words and yelling at her what the heck. She just goes on about how she really likes me and thought she could change my mind about just being friends. I take her crazy ass explanation as a sign to leave. I run to the door downstairs and have trouble unlocking it because i’m dumb and anxiety ridden and fail to unlock the lock at the top of the door. She comes downstairs and puts her arm on the door trapping me between the door and her. I’m only about 5 feet tall while she was closer to 6 feet so I feel completely powerless. I kinda shift myself until I see the lock and burst out of the door. I run two houses down to the bus stop and just wait for a bus to show in the freezing cold. She follows me outside going in between an apology and some kinda of persuasion on why I should go back inside and she even asked me if I wanted to go back out on a second date. At this point I just go off and tell her i specifically told her there was no date and that I never want to see her again. She tries to grab my arm or hand I guess to soothe me or maybe just drag me back in the house but I swat it away and just yell things I can’t even remember until she leaves. I waited about 45 minutes in the cold. When i got back to my dorm I saw an abundance of texts from her going between saying she’s sorry for crossing my boundaries to stuff about how we’re both girls so it’s not as weird to talking about my chest and how pretty I am. I’m freaked out and just block her on absolutely everything. I had trouble sleeping the whole night and I still just feel so violated. I can’t even comprehend how a normal person thought any of that was okay. 

I feel like I just got out of a Law and Order episode. I feel like what she did isn’t enough to be called sexual harassment or assault so I feel guilty for feeling so gross by the situation. I can’t help but think the roommates were in on some sort of plan to get me to the house and then just left me with her. ",6,1734400206.0,offmychest,1,0.88,False

as someone incredibly unlucky and down the past few years, nobody associates with me anymore. everyone leaves me on delivered, even when i ask how they are. i’ll invite someone to hangout, they’ll reject the invitation and then go hangout with others and post about it. if someone’s feeling “kind” they might give me a 1 hour coffee date on a Monday night. I have always been mindful to keep my discussions of my situation to a minimum, to avoid negativity. when i lost my job and had trouble with the current job market, people stopped asking me to hangout. when i had two failed surgeries this year, people stopped asking how i am. now that my health has declined even worse, i have no contacts in my life anymore. they’ve all slowly faded away after pitying my situations and then treated me differently. this is very difficult as a 25 yo woman who desires the sanity of companionship and friends. this feels like a negative feedback loop that is nearly impossible to escape from. when i think about it — if i somehow miraculously had a change of luck, i wouldn’t want to associate with me or people like me either, I’d want to get away from it. i add nothing to the table anymore, i have no network that would entice another person my age to stay in contact with me. my health and career struggles have just compounded onto each other, and now i’m basically a shut in. i was never this way to this degree in my entire life, and it hurts so badly. i’ve also learned that some people i have known through my life aren’t real friends to discard me like this. what is one to do in my situation — or do i just accept a loner life confined to the outskirts of society?

She had a fever one day and the hospice nurse told my mom that she was likely in transition (her main dx was malnutrition, but also had afib, and heart failure), and probably wouldn’t make it to Christmas. Well, everyday, my Gigi was still the same Gigi. She got up, put on her beautiful clothes, jewelry and makeup like she always did. Made her coffee at 7am, etc. She was 92 and was obviously tired, but everyone thought my papa would likely go first given the dementia and heart failure. She refused morphine, and struggled to breathe the last 2 weeks of her life. About 5 days before she passed, she became confused and was sleeping a lot more, but still refusing any medication. On Tuesday, she suffered severe terminal agitation, was flailing, screaming no no no, trying to crawl over the bed rail, kicking people, and even spit the morphine out they tried to give her. Eventually my mom had to help hold her down while the nurses administered more drugs (haldol, increased morphine dose, and some anti anxiety med). She eventually went to sleep, and passed away the next day. My mom is absolutely broken over the fact that she held her mom down and did that. She’s traumatized and thinks hospice drugged her mom to sleep and that she helped. She was incredibly close to her mom, more so than most people. This whole thing happened so fast and so slow at the same time, and now suddenly, she’s gone. Has anyone had to help hold someone down? How do you find peace when they clearly didn’t want to go, didn’t want the meds etc? How to you come to terms it was their time, when they didn’t want it to be. My Gigi told my mom she was scared because she was never going to get to see her children again. My Gigi is a devout catholic, but the end still scared her. I have faith in God, and do believe he calls us home and has a bigger plan that we aren’t always able to comprehend. But it’s still been hard to wrap my mind around it? You always think of death as someone peacefully passing in her sleep when it’s their time. This is all my first encounter with death of a loved one, hospice, end of life care etc.. thanks in advance

1hfzmue,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hfzmue/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/,"After my father died, I found a logbook concealed in his hospice room that he could not have written. (Part 3)","Never in my life have I experienced such a relentless case of insomnia as I did after reading the details of John’s “second translocation”.

My left eye was identical to Atlas’ left eye. Both eyes bore a striking resemblance to the[ sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP), which was omnipresent but completely unaddressed in all of John’s entries.

It felt like all the residual thoughts and questions surrounding the contents of the deathbed logbook had begun to occupy physical space in my head. Every time I restlessly repositioned my head on my pillow I could feel the weight of those ruminations slosh around in my skull, the partially coagulated thoughtform taking a few moments to settle out like the fluid in a magic eight ball. Eventually, I gave up on sleep entirely. I resigned myself to reviewing the events described in John’s logbook, trying to inspect each piece from every possible angle in order to glean an epiphany, as if that epiphany would act as some sort of mental Ambien. Unfortunately, it became clear that I was still missing some crucial components to this narrative, and I could divine nothing additional from the information I already had absorbed that would pacify my ragged psyche. I needed more. 

Cup of coffee in hand, I reluctantly sat back down at my office desk. I glanced over at the clock - 330 AM. After taking a few deep, meditative breaths, I did what I could to brace myself and I flipped over another menu. 

For the next several logs I read that night, I don’t believe there will be any utility to me reproducing them here in their entirety. First and foremost, there is a certain amount of redundancy to some of the entries that may only serve to cast a fog over the through-line of the events described. Maybe more critically, however, is my fear of incompletion. My health has again worsened since the last time I uploaded a post. I am anxious to put a pin in this, so I will use the space below to synthesize those entries to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. Before I begin, I do feel like I need to address how I scarred my left eye. 

Death marches indifferently towards all of us from the moment we are born - sometimes gradually, sometimes swiftly. If you had asked me a year ago which was preferable, assuming you were forced to make a selection, I would say a swift death, without a single shred of hesitation in my response. Bearing witness to the stepwise loss of my dad’s identity over the last five years has been indescribably tortuous. And to clarify, I really do mean that it has been indescribable. I genuinely don’t know the appropriate words to describe the abject horrors of dementia. God knows I’ve tried to find them. It’s like watching someone’s soul rot. Each passing day, a small piece of your loved one is involuntarily divested, dissolving into the atmosphere like steam. But, unlike with my fiancé, I had ample time and space to say my goodbyes, I suppose. 

With no creativity whatsoever, my response to John’s disease was to bottle up my emotions and turn to liquor as a means to dull my senses. Tale as old as time. Wren, my fiancé, tried to help me. But I was ritually intoxicated, forlorn and distracted, and when it mattered most, I did not see the stop sign. In complete contrast to John, I lost her instantaneously. I, on the other hand, only sustained a deep laceration to my left eye and a few fractured ribs.

Wren knew I loved her, thankfully. I had taken the time to let her know how much she meant to me, telling her she was my kaleidoscope. Looking through her, the world could appear vibrant and worthwhile, and I made sure she knew that.

In another twist of the knife that almost feels poetic, John didn’t have the wherewithal to talk me through how he processed the guilt of his crash. He couldn’t tell me how he coped with suffocating regret. My father was just too far gone by the time Wren died.

Two dimming stars in the moonless night that had nearly crossed paths - John and I were following similar trajectories, but we were just a little too distant from each other to communicate.

I need to move on from this topic, otherwise I’ll never complete this. Just know that after the events of the last year, I don’t have such a clear-cut answer for which death is worse

Not anymore. 

Selected excerpt 1: April, 2005

“\[...\] *One thing I have noticed upon reflection is that some of my memories in the past few years do not feel entirely my own. I have spent months recovering from my crash (seizure and translocation free, thankfully), which has allowed me the opportunity to review my cache of recollections in full. From at least the year 2000 and on, I feel like I have only the imprints of my memories - they are just files stored on a biological hard-drive. I can access them, open and close them, but I do not feel like I myself experienced them.*

*Lucy attributes this all to the stress of my position at CellCept, with a resulting depression draining those more recent memories of their inherent technicolor. I have considered this, but I am not so sure. Although I have taken the time to confirm these abnormally textured memories are not false, i.e. confirmed with others that they did actually happen as I can recollect them, I just do not feel I was there when they were made. But I clearly was* \[...\]”

An important insight. I will come back to it soon. 

Most of the entries pre and post-crash are very introspective and well put together. After explaining his theorem regarding why sound disappears with the arrival of Atlas in his translocations and how that could represent the “inverse of a memory” (see the end of post 2), he picks up where he left off in trying to prove the existence and scientific underpinnings of his translocations. To save you all the trouble, I have omitted most of the entries dedicated to mathematically proving his translocations. Personally, I have grappled with the “noise canceling headphones” metaphor for quite a while before I felt like I had the gist of it. Little did I know that this was the equivalent of kindergarten arts and crafts when compared to his subsequently described theorems. If you have a PhD in calculus, biophysics and electromagnetism, feel free to message me privately and I’ll send over some pictures. For us laypeople, it’s best to skip ahead to this next piece: 

Selected excerpt 2: July, 2005

“\[...\] *the biophysical motion as calculated does seem mathematically sound. However, to complete my postulates, I will need to perform an experiment in spacial relativity. To do this, I will need to adopt a sort of metaphysical vigilance. At some point, I expect I will begin translocating again. When I do, I will need to somehow recognize that my consciousness is out of its expected position before Atlas makes its presence known.*

*To this end, and to Lucy’s chagrin (relating to a lack of spousal consultation), I went out and got my first tattoo this morning. Specifically, one of The Smashing Pumpkins’ logos - the heart that has the letters “SP” within it. It covers most of my right forearm and currently stings like some fresh hell.*

*My reasoning is this: if my consciousness is receding into a memory, I think I should recall what was and not what currently is. Therefore, it stands to reason that if I’m mid-translocation, lost within in a memory, I will NOT have this tattoo on my forearm. Hopefully, this will enable me to realize I’m translocating before Atlas finds me.*

*There are a few caveats here: first and foremost, it is possible that I will simply merge how I am now with how I was in my memory, resulting in me visualizing myself with the tattoo on my arm even though it would not have happened yet. If the countless studies on the unreliability of courtroom eyewitness misidentification are any indication, our memories are very fallible and subject to external forces. Second, if in the future I am translocating to a memory that occurs AFTER I got my tattoo, this will obviously not be very helpful. Lastly, even if it does work, I do not know for sure that the evidence I am looking for will even be perceptible to me. If this works, however, and I can appreciate that I am translocating before Atlas arrives, I hope that I can find my tether* \[...\]”

There are no entries dated between July 2005 and the end of 2007. In early 2008, they resumed, but they just start over with describing his initial translocation, with some notable differences. The first appreciable difference is the time stamp. The second and more disturbing difference is how they rapidly fracture and devolve. 

Excerpt from March 2008:

*First translocation.*

*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM. Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications.* 

*Wearily, I stood at the top of our banister, surveying the beautiful disaster that was raising young children -*(immediate, harsh scribbles directly after the world “children”)

*John put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.

*I then began to appreciate the figure before me. He stood at least 10 feet tall. His arms and legs were the same proportions, which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length. which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length.*

Dried blood streaks led up to a center point of the stretched skin, where a fountain of mercurial silver erupted upwards. Following the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyes*\[...\]”

It continues like that for a while, then cuts off into more scribbles. Of note, the scribbles were inter-cut with sketches of the sigil ([see here for reference](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP)).

There are a lot of entries like this, with the only new dialogue being “John, put NLRP77 in SC484”. None of those numbers meant anything to me the first time I read them. 

When I looked up from my desk, dawn had arrived. With about ten entries left to go, I decided to stop. I had obligations to attend to, involving Lucy, my mother.

I knew I had to ask her about the deathbed logbook, but I dreaded it deeply. Not because I was afraid of her reaction or her emotional state after reading it, or that I was under the impression she would not know anything. Very much the opposite - I was afraid of what she might know. 

I carried my sleep deprived body over to the house I had grown up in. After John’s passing, my mom had planned on taking the time to declutter and downsize their belongings, intending on moving in with Greg and his family. She answered the door with a very on-brand cherry disposition, but her mood shifted to one of concern when she saw my bloodshot eyes. 

I think John fell in love with my mother for the same reasons he was jealous of Greg. Lucy took life in stride, and this made her ineffably resilient to change and strife. Despite this, my father’s dementia had undeniably sapped her of some of her effervescence. You could tell that her cherry disposition rang slightly hollow nowadays. That being said, Lucy’s ability to still conjure and maintain that disposition, even if slightly hollow, is perhaps the utmost attestation to her resilience. 

After assisting her with various tasks that morning, we sat down at the kitchen table for lunch, and I finally manifested the courage to show her some of the logs. I only brought bits and pieces for review, not wanting to disconcert her with the more violent imagery. John never mentioned anything about a 10-foot tall man that visited him in his memories, she remarked with a characteristic chortle. Credit where credit is due, the abruptness and absurdity of that question is objectively funny, and it was comforting to know that Lucy was still able to find humor in these darker days.  

“Honestly honey, I think it’s all just remnants of his mind having a bit of a last hoorah.” She said after completing her review. “I know this has cut you so deeply, especially since you were busy with your residency training the last few years. You have enough on your plate with what happened to Wren. Try not to overburden yourself.”

“You don’t think it’s odd that dad was able to write this, in secret, while on hospice? With us needing to help him with everything like we did?”

Lucy had to take a moment to determine her impression of that statement. Eventually, she replied:

“I think dad spent his last few years in a power struggle with his dementia, whether he appreciated it or not. I know you weren’t around to see this, but some days were great. He was almost himself.” She paused and decided to rephrase the last statement: “Well no, that’s not quite right, he was always himself, to his last moments here. On his good days, though, he had *the ability* to act like himself. This would include writing, as you well know.”

“You never saw him writing anything while visiting him at hospice?” I replied sharply, trying to swallow a bout of rising sorrow that was building in my throat as I did. I needed to stay on task.

Lucy put her hand over mine.

“No, Pete, nothing. But that doesn’t mean he couldn’t or that he didn’t. Also, you know how overworked the aides are in the memory unit - just because they didn’t see or don’t remember seeing him write, doesn’t mean it did not happen”.

We were silent for a while after that, cooling down from the emotionally taxing exchange. 

“It reminds me a lot of the way he would write his research, actually. I wish we could ask Majorie,” she remarked solemnly.

This is the turning point. 

“Wait, that’s a great idea. Why can’t we ask her?”

Majorie, as a reminder, was dad’s co-researcher at CellCept. They had met in graduate school and were fast friends despite the large, fifteen-year age gap. As you might imagine, there were not a lot of options for academic kinship when my dad was earning his PhD - cellular topography is a niche avenue of investigation now, to my understanding, let alone back in the 80s (see post 1 for a more complete description of the job). Lucy and Majorie had also gotten along very well, but in a flash of realization, I now appreciated that I had not seen them together since I graduated middle school. 

When Lucy saw my confused expression, she put her hand to her mouth, coming to terms with the fact that she had let something slip.

“Well, shoot. We didn’t want to tell you when you were a kid, love. It was right after dad’s crash - you were still very shaken-up about death and dying.”

It took me a moment to register what she was implying.

“Majorie…is dead?”

From here, Lucy filled in a few critical gaps in the story. After John’s crash, Marjorie took over as the sole researcher on the project they had both recently been promoted to. CellCept was a pharmaceutical company interested in developing medications targeted at improving human longevity at the cellular level. They had both been working there since grad school (so at least a decade) without a sizable increase in their pay before this new project.

The goal was this: another branch of the company had found a line of uniquely immortal stem cells, and it became John and Marjorie’s job to determine on a cellular level why that was the case (Lucy thinks these cells were discovered incidentally at an autopsy of someone who had donated their body to science, but that is all she can remember of their origin). My mom thinks that the promotion occurred in early 2004, predating the first entry in John’s logbook by a few months.

After the crash incapacitated John, Marjorie’s workload doubled as she mapped the interior of that infinitely dividing cell line without a partner. In the overwhelming chaos of the crash, and in caring for John’s extensive health needs after he was released from the hospital, Lucy had lost touch with Majorie. She explained to me that her assumption was that Marjorie was consumed with work, now that she was the only one on the project, and that’s why she saw little her in those months after the accident.

There was a point in time while my dad recovered that he considered not returning to CellCept - per Lucy, “he had felt more alive in that recovery time then he did since he accepted the job”. Maybe he would become a stay-at-home dad, John thought. Lily, my sister, still had health issues after her childhood cancer that would always benefit from increased supervision. 

One night in May 2004, however, John received an unexpected call from Marjorie’s wife. Over the previous few months, she had developed rapid onset neurologic symptoms and was unlikely to live for more than another week. Doctors had diagnosed her with “sporadic CJD,” also known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

CJD is a wildly progressive and incredibly rare entity, estimated to affect approximately one American in a million per year. Essentially, the pathophysiology involves “prions” - self-propagating proteins that proliferate in brain matter, causing injury and subsequent degradation of neurons. This disease remains poorly understood because it’s the only disease I know of where proteins alone act as an infection.

Proteins are the molecules that allow all cells to function - fundamental building blocks to human cells, bacterial cells, viral cells, so on and so on. Canonically, though, they are not really considered to be “alive” - simply parts that create a larger whole. In the same way that if you cut off your hand and you were somehow able to keep the tissue from decaying, you probably wouldn’t consider that phantom appendage to be “alive” in the same way you are.

And yet, the proteins implicated in CJD are able to “infect” a human host if infested tissues are consumed (there are cases in Papua New Guinea of aboriginal tribespeople developing a subset of this disease due to ritualistic cannibalism of human brain tissue). There is no treatment, and diagnosis of the disease is usually presumed in patients who have all the cardinal findings of CJD as well as MRI and lab findings that are in support of the diagnosis. However, it is important to note that the only way to definitively make this diagnosis is through a brain biopsy, which is seldom performed due to the risk of spreading the infectious, deadly protein. Most patients die within one year of symptom onset.

The punchline of all of this is that the symptoms of CJD are, broadly speaking, the same symptoms as Alzheimer’s Dementia, John’s diagnosis - they just occur and progress much quicker. When I asked Lucy if she had any seizures, she said Marjorie did. I would later exhaustively research CJD, only to find that seizures are incredibly uncommon in CJD, a disease that is already a one in a million diagnosis (The National Institutes of Health quotes that less than 3% of cases of CJD are accompanied by seizures).

She passed two days after my dad got that phone call. No brain biopsy was ever performed on Marjorie. Because CellCept wanted the project to continue, they threatened John’s potential severance package and reputation in the field if he did not come back to work. Under that coercion, he returned to CellCept in September 2005. 

These revelations staggered me. I could tell, with an unexplainable extrasensory insight, that all of this was relevant, I just didn’t initially know *why* it was relevant. It appeared that John experienced all the same symptoms that Marjorie did, she just succumbed to her disease much quicker than him. Yet, something was amiss here. John certainly did not develop CJD - he would have never lasted so long with that diagnosis. If you look at it from the opposing perspective, Majorie developed all the same symptoms that John, including seizures, which do not fit with the diagnosis of CJD, or are at least an exceptionally rare manifestation of an already exceptionally rare disease. 

Knowing that digesting this new information would take time, I put it on the backburner and resumed helping Lucy pack. In doing so, I ended up being tasked with taking apart the bedframe in John’s old room. I say John’s room, because they had been sleeping in different bedrooms for at least a decade before his death. This was not the sign of a dissolving marriage, rather, John was an incredibly light sleeper and Lucy was diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2001, requiring her to start wearing a CPAP machine overnight. If you’re not familiar with how CPAP machines looked in the early 2000s, it is worth a google - they were loud, heavy machines in their infancy. John would have better luck sleeping in the same room as a practicing mariachi band.

As if the last twenty-four hours had not already been dizzying enough, in the process of dismantling the wooden bedframe I discovered something hidden in the exact same part of the bed that I had found his logbook. In his hospice room, I found the logs under the mattress in the top left-hand corner. In his old bedroom, I found a singular key taped to the underside of the frame in the same, top left-hand corner. Engraved on the key were the numbers “484”.

As much as I want to finish this, I need to rest.

To introduce what is coming in the next post (which may be the penultimate or ultimate post, depending on my energy levels in the coming few days), the SC484 in the phrase “John, put NLRP77 in SC484” referred to a storage container numbered 484 at a warehouse half an hour from my childhood home. When questioned, Lucy did not know of its existence. No one did. 

Days later, I would develop the prerequisite bravery to find and unlock that abhorrent vault. Inside an eight hundred square foot container laid thousands of moth-eaten marble notebooks, stacked in unorganized, schizophrenic piles, as well as the final grim piece to understanding [the sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP). John Morrison was correct when he said he knew the sigil wasn’t depicting an eye. Or, more accurately, it wasn’t *only* the depiction of an eye. 

Something more devastating was concealed within it, waiting for me and me alone.

First time posting on here. I (f/39) just need a place to rant and need some advice. Yesterday I went over to one of my sister’s V (36) house (partner couldn’t go because he got the stomach bug) to celebrate both our bdays (different days). I have a 3 year old daughter ( who I will call E) who likes to run around, curious at everything in their house, and getting into things. My sister and bil have no children.

I had stepped away to check on the food grilling in the backyard and by the time I got back, I noticed E had picked a vase of flowers from the coffee table (was never there when I left), told her to put it back down. When she did, the vase tipped over and water came out…I rushed over to clean the spill and as I was doing that, my BIL seething with anger, went up to her and yelled at her “I’ve had enough of you! You have been terrorizing my house!” and all this happened right in front of my sister, my youngest sister S (her and her family are currently living with V/BIL temporarily) and our 2 guests.  (Note- this is not the first time he’s upset with her. The last time she was hugging her 2 year old cousin (from my other sister), too long, her cousin was not having it and he had to yell at me to “Come get your child!”)

Thank god she didn’t understand what was going on last night. I finished cleaning up, got her shoes on, said goodbyes to my youngest sister and 2 guests and left the house. V sent me an apology for her husband’s action and later suggested both me and partner take Parenting Classes. BIL later messaged me an apology for his meltdown (I’ve yet to apologize to him since according to my youngest sister, me and my partner needed to apologize to him and my sister V on our end).

 As of now, I’ve probably cooled off from last night. I’ve decided that it’s best that we don’t bring E to their place anymore. They’re always stressed out when it comes to her. We do watch after her, but she can be a handful and challenging. I’ve only asked them to watch E once and that was when she was 1. I’ve always gauged to see if they’re up to babysitting her as she’s gotten older and a bit more rambunctious. But the only response I get from BIL is No while laughing it off (I’ve always joking asked and each answer I get from him tells me he’s not interested/suitable to babysit at this point). So from then on, my partner and I always bring E with us everywhere for the last 2 years. Even my other sister don’t trust them watching after her 2 year old daughter whenever V asks why won’t you let us watch after her?

This upcoming Wednesday, my sister V wants to have a meeting. I told her she can come, but it can just only be her or bring our other sister S to be our mediator.

So Mommits, should I stop taking my daughter E over to their place whenever there’s a family get together at their place? I always feel both my sister V and bil will always be stressed out whenever we bring her.  And how do I go about making an apology? Any parenting advice on a child who has so much energy?

Sprinkle with light gravel and bake in a 350ºoven for 15 minutes. For best results serve warm.

**MUGABUGS**

Remove the legs from 40-50 small garden-type insects and set them aside. (beetles and so forth are best; ants are too small; flies are hard to catch) With a mortar and pestle, pulverize the insect bodies into a thick paste (note: food processors will generally create too much of a ""whipped"" consistency, plus they're hard to clean). In a bowl, mix the paste into a cup of flour, two sticks of butter, 2 tsps Blue No. 2 synthetic colorant, and a dash of salt. Form the mixture into small anthill-like mounds on a well-greased baking pan (you know what to use for this!) and bake in a 350ºoven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle a generous tumble of insect legs onto each cookie. For best results serve warm.

**SAM 'N ELLA'S HOLIDAY JUMBLES**

These unusual treats were a favorite of my late aunt and uncle (well, they made them that one time). Although we never tried them, we kids called them ""Cluck-Clucks"" - and you'll see why. They're easy and quick because they're ""counter cookies"": no baking needed. Plus they're sure to provide some extra income for all the Emergency Room physicians in your family. And who doesn't need some of that at holiday time!

Remove the skin and bones from a large chicken breast and set them aside. Grind the chicken using a mortar and pestle until gluey and lustrous. In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken paste, 4 eggs, a cup of flour, two sticks of butter, 2 tsps Yellow No. 6 synthetic colorant and a dash of salt. When set, spoon equal amounts of the mixture onto a well-greased pan (there should be about a dozen). Cover with a dishcloth and set aside overnight. These go great with coffee or hot chocolate... and for an extra crunch you can pulverize the breast bones into a light powder and dust each cookie! Serve the chicken skin separately.

**CHEVY SURPRISES**

This recipe works best with ingredients sourced from that old '57 Chevy One-Fifty out back of the Johnson place. But you can substitute as needed. The main thing is finding oil that is thick and black: the more viscous, the better the final mixture will set!

Drain a quart of motor oil from the car and set aside (depending on age this may take some time; it will help to start the car and let it run for a few minutes... but don't burn your hands! if the engine won't turn over, try dragging the car into the sun for a few hours). In a mixing bowl, combine a cup of flour, two sticks of butter, 2 tsps Red No. 4 and a dash of salt. (note: Red No. 4 has been delisted under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act - those scolds - so may be more difficult to find) Pour enough of the oil onto the flour mix to give it a doughy consistency. Save the rest - you'll need it. Form the dough mixture into small mounds on a well-greased pan and bake in a 350ºoven for 15 minutes (note: keep a fire extinguisher handy). Allow to cool, then place each cookie into a small ramekin and pour equal amounts of the rest of the oil into each. Eat with a spoon.",1,1734399395.0,rDarkHumor,0,1.0,False

My grandmother was notified that she would be moving into a different job because they had this man moving cities to have her job. You can imagine that my grandmother already didn't like him much.

Day 2:

This man (my grandfather) arrives at the building with a brief case and a suit on, he was really overdressed and he was already getting attention from women. Apparently he politely ignored all of them to go and talk to my grandmother, he didn't know that this was the woman that he stole the job off of. Apparently my grandmother just got the conversation over and done with as quickly as possible and left the office disliking him even more than when he arrived.


Over the next couple weeks my grandfather kept buying my grandmother coffees and lunch and the occasional bouquet. My grandmother had already met this other man (we'll call him George).

My grandmother walked into work with George one morning and my grandfather got jealous. George and my grandfather were constantly trying to one up each other.

So, my grandmother scheduled a date to the ""pictures"" (as she put it ♥️) with George and my grandfather found out and basically challenged him to a physical fight after work, George and my grandmother said that that was a bad idea. After work, George and my grandfather started arguing just outside the office and my grandmother saw. My grandfather asked my grandmother to settle it she refused and said (not meaning it) ""Fight it out and whoever wins will meet me outside the pictures tomorrow."" So, they did fight it out and my grandfather showed up at the pictures instead of George.

My grandmother and my grandfather actually really hit it off and George ended up meeting another woman. My grandparents went on a few more dates before they actually started dating and I do have a few more stories about that but I will leave it here and see if this gets popular enough.

He’s 78 years old and has generally been in decent health, though he recently experienced a major stressor. Here’s what happened:

	•	After walking home (~30 minutes) and stopping at a store, he sat down and complained that something felt ‘off’ with his head.

	•	Moments later, he climbed onto a table unconsciously and started speaking nonsensically, unable to recognize anyone.

	•	He was taken to the doctor. By the time he arrived, he could answer some questions (e.g., knew the year and month), but responded oddly to instructions (e.g., when asked to raise his hands, he referenced chess, a game he has played his whole life and told doctor that if he raises hands he can take his queen with his bishop).

	•	He was sent home later, and now, days later, he oscillates between being coherent and suddenly confused. For example:

	•	He talks to me normally but occasionally switches to discussing chess randomly. (eg. maybe i will lose this chess game but i won't lose life)

	•	He forgot how to hold a coffee cup.

	•	He struggles with basic tasks like using a phone, which he previously handled fine.

The CT scan reportedly showed nothing significant, but the doctor prescribed blood thinners, suspecting a vascular issue. I wasn’t at the appointment, so I’m piecing this together from my mom’s account.

Does this sound like a TIA, a silent stroke, or possibly early signs of vascular dementia? Could it be something else entirely (e.g., delirium or even a seizure)? He has no history of similar issues, though stress may have been a trigger.

We also had some classes together in previous semester. I ran into him about a week later and he then asked for my phone number to talk about our final paper together. He texted me a few times about the paper before it was due and then afterwards to let me know grades were in. That same night, Thursday, he asked me out to coffee, then we went Friday afternoon because I was coming back home for break that same night. When we met for coffee he said that he wanted to make some more friends who lived in his same hometown (we both live in the same hometown and happen to go to the same college about 2 hrs away). It only lasted about an hour because he had some job interviews scheduled but I think we both had a nice time and he said that we should hang out once he moves back home. I texted him to congratulate him on graduating today and no response. 

I initially thought that he might have been interested based on his forwardness but is it more likely that he really is just looking for a friend? He may not be responding because I’m sure he’s celebrating his graduation, but I’m worried about embarrassing myself if he’s just looking for a friend. I’ve thought he was cute for the past 2 semesters but never said anything because I didn’t think he’d ever be interested. ",1,1734398663.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Comparing Various Teeth Whitening Methods: Effectiveness and Safety
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has gained immense popularity in recent years, with many people eager to achieve a brighter, more radiant smile. This desire often leads to questions about the various teeth whitening methods available, their effectiveness, and their safety. Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions regarding your oral health.

### At-Home Whitening Kits

At-home whitening kits are among the most common methods for achieving a brighter smile. These kits typically contain a lower concentration of whitening agents compared to professional treatments, making them a gentler option.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Effectiveness:** Most at-home kits show noticeable results after a few applications. However, the results depend on the initial shade of your teeth and consistency in use.
- **Safety:** Generally considered safe, at-home kits can occasionally cause tooth sensitivity or gum irritation. Following the manufacturer's instructions is crucial.

### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpaste is an easy and accessible option for daily dental care. These products often include mild abrasives and chemical agents that help remove surface stains.

- **Effectiveness:** Whitening toothpaste can improve brightness slightly, but they often won’t produce drastic change on their own.
- **Safety:** Generally safe for regular use, their mild formulation makes them less likely to cause sensitivity.

### Professional In-Office Treatments

For those seeking immediate results, professional in-office whitening treatments are often the most effective option. Dentists use high-concentration whitening agents and specialized lights to accelerate the process.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Effectiveness:** These treatments can lighten teeth by several shades within a single session, making them highly effective.
- **Safety:** While generally safe, these treatments may lead to temporary sensitivity. Dentists typically take precautions to minimize discomfort.

### Laser Whitening

Laser whitening is a high-tech approach where a laser is used to activate the whitening agent applied to the teeth. This method aims to enhance the bleaching process.

- **Effectiveness:** Laser treatments can provide some of the quickest and most dramatic whitening results.
- **Safety:** This option is safe in the hands of professionals but can cause increased sensitivity for some patients.

### Custom Tray Whitening

This method involves creating a personalized dental tray filled with a whitening gel. You wear the tray for several hours or overnight, depending on the product.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Effectiveness:** Custom trays can produce significant whitening effects, often comparable to in-office treatments if used properly.
- **Safety:** As these trays are designed for individual use, the risk of gum irritation is lower if used correctly.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Remedies

Many individuals seek natural methods to whiten their teeth, such as baking soda or activated charcoal. While these are touted as safe and natural options, their effectiveness remains debated.

- **Effectiveness:** Natural remedies may help in removing some surface stains but are less effective for deep-set discoloration.
- **Safety:** They are generally safe, but excessive use can wear down tooth enamel. Moderation is crucial.

### Choosing the Right Method

When deciding on a teeth whitening method, consider the following factors:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Your budget: Professional treatments can be more expensive than at-home kits.
- The severity of tooth discoloration: Deeper stains often require professional solutions.
- Your sensitivity levels: If you have sensitive teeth, gentler methods may be preferable.
- Time constraints: For instant results, in-office treatments are the best choice.

The right teeth whitening method can vary greatly based on individual needs and preferences. Do your research, consult with your dentist, and choose a method that is both effective and safe for your unique smile. Remember, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups will keep your smile shining bright long after the whitening process.

### Conclusion

The journey to a brighter smile through teeth whitening before and after can be an exciting one, and it's important to understand the remarkable transformation many experience. Whether you’re pursuing a professional dental treatment or exploring at-home whitening kits, the results often showcase a dramatic improvement in the shade of your teeth. Many individuals report increased confidence and satisfaction, highlighting the emotional benefits that accompany physical changes.

When comparing various teeth whitening methods, it’s critical to consider both effectiveness and safety. Professional treatments, like in-office bleaching, tend to deliver the quickest and most noticeable results, but they come with a higher cost and potential sensitivity. On the other hand, at-home whitening strips and gels can be more affordable and convenient, though they may take longer to show results. Understanding the nuances between these options empowers you to make an informed decision that aligns with your goals.

By the way before anyone questions my  FA status because I act, I am on disability, I have ZERO friends, I suffer from mental illness and I'm single and been single for a long time...I'm already prepared to get down voted like crazy but I just had to get this off my chest. So basically I'm a struggling actor. I mainly do it ""for fun"" but acting is very difficult to do even recreationally as it takes a lot of time & effort. It's just something people do on the side until or unless it makes them big bucks...I think most people on the outside see it that way as well. Anyways, I was never really huge on auditioning (was never good at it, which it is an actual skill, they even have classes you can take for it)....So with that being said, I was getting back into acting after a long hiatus away from it and decided to post on a fb group looking to collab on projects together with fellow actors. I got contacted by this drop dead gorgeous girl, I mean, and to no surprise she models as well. We've collabed and worked on a couple of things already & I mean the star contrast to her life and mine is beyond incomparable. Basically, the most recent thing we did together, was a very short shoot that I facilitated and wrote. We both were headed to location, long story short I got into a very bad car wreck on that day (still getting hashed out now which is a nightmare), anyways after the shoot was done, she was down to give me a ride back to my wrecked car, so I can at least call a tow, and she was down to give me a ride back to my place.

So she was a sweetheart in that sense, which I appreciated very much. While we were driving out of the parking garage, she was thinking of going inside of a cafe to warm up and get some coffee, but I had mentioned maybe we could get some together. Quickly she began to say she was only thinking about it, and how maybe I can be dropped off to my wrecked car to get it towed. She eventually parked by the cafe, just to take hit of a gb. While she was doing that, I swear to god she had mad different people blowing her up to hang out or people trying to make plans with her. I heard somewhere very attractive people are treated like mini celebrities. I thought they were over exaggerating to a point but nah that shit is so damn true it's not even funny. Not to sound like some envious prick, but it must nice to never have to worry about making plans, having others make them for you. In any single day, you will never ever have to experience loneliness or boredom on pretty much any level possible, and if you do decide to stay in, it is usually voluntary, unlike for FAs, we're homebodies not out of choice which is a completely different thing. I hope if people reply, nobody really tries to relate my being FA to acting because it has nothing to do with it...Also meeting people through acting is hard, as you have to audition for parts to even go to set to mingle with other actors. It's a very tough business before anyone points that out..I know, well except for her as she has told me she books roles very often, even with just auditioning half ass without a proper set up. (It doesn't surprise me as looks privilege is a very real thing, no matter how many normies try to deny it, especially in this business it's VERY real)

Anyways, the point is of course as the pathetic FA I am, I'm catching (I wouldn't even say feelings) and as movie corny as this sounds, I just wanna be around her....I just wanna know her, out side of this whole acting stuff, which is the only time we ever see each other. The thing is, she gives very mixed signals even on that front (platonically), as she has mostly replied only when regarding meeting up for acting, (rightfully so) well besides the very beginning, but as of today, her replies have been pretty fast compared to other times, told her about my past drug issues as she's opened up about her stuff as well, and so I thought we were connecting....I promised myself I would never compromise this acting relationship we have for something I know is never going to ever happen ever...BUT since the accident happened, and more than likely I won't ever be able to drive now since I'm most likely going to lose the insurance battle, meeting her to collab is put to a complete halt for the foreseeable future, so I felt I had nothing to lose. So earlier today I straight up asked or told her, hey ""let's hang out today""....

I mention that because she always seemed to have an answer for if I even give a hint that I wanted to do something after. Before anyone says anything, no I understand I am not entitled to it nor am I mad about it. I am just telling the story. So when I straight up asked, she told me she couldn't as she had something to film today, and also had her friend come over for auditions to help as a reader. When I said I meant in general, like one day, she glazed over that and replied something off topic....I did say if she didn't want to in general, she should just tell me. She still glazed over that and replied with something else. My thing now is, clearly we can't even meet for the forseeable future to collab, (the only reason we are talking to begin with), and she also clearly does not want to hang out side of this realm, why does she continue to reply? Why not just ghost me? Is she enjoying the chase? Is she considering (as she never said yes but didn't say no either) but just wants to get to know me more before confirming an answer? I'm just so lost. The thing is, I'm not even trying to pursue a date with her, I just want to hang with her as a friend because when we work together, the chemistry is definitely there acting wise and we goof around and have a good time...Then online her energy definitely is different, she won't reply much, just here and there (well except for part of today of course), and then when hanging out gets mentioned, she replies back as if I just spoke Chinese to her or if I add something to that reply, she will only reply to that but glaze over the part I wanted her to answer if that makes sense

And yes this girl is definitely 100 percent out my league. The sad thing is this is par for the course for me. I see guys here or on the original FA complain about being friend zoned. I can't even get frienzoned...Yes it happens even with average girls as well. I just get FAzoned...I'm so undesirable to the opposite sex, they don't even want to be friends with me, let that sink in....More then likely though, what the actual truth probably is, is that she has plenty of friends already and doesn't need an extra one. She has enough attention coming her way, so mine is very very well let's just say not worth a dime to her. She probably has people fighting to get her attention, a lot of people she has to reschedule even to hang out, so someone she barely knows like me, I'm nothing. I guess it just kinda makes me think how I got myself to this point, to where I'm even comparing my life to someone who lives in a completely different stratosphere ",2,1734398577.0,FA30plus,0,1.0,False

There's something magical about coffee — a warm cup in your hands feels like an embrace. It's that perfect companion that never lets you down, no matter what. Whether you're facing a busy workday, a quiet morning, or a late-night hustle, coffee is always ready to uplift you.

Unlike others, coffee doesn't judge. It doesn’t care about your imperfections or rough days; it simply gives you what you need — warmth, comfort, and that burst of energy to keep going. Every sip reminds you that you're not alone in your struggles. Coffee has this special way of making everything feel a little bit easier, a little bit better.

No matter how many cups you’ve had or how stressed you are, coffee won’t turn its back on you. It’s a love that’s steady, reliable, and always present, waiting for you whenever you need it. Through every grind, every brew, coffee is there — never judging, always supporting, and giving up on you.

So next time you take that first sip, remember: coffee is more than just a drink. It's a reminder that love, in its purest form, is unconditional and everlasting. Keep sipping, keep loving. ☕❤️ #CoffeeIsLove #NeverLetsYouDown #AlwaysThereForYou",1,1734398528.0,AlonewithmyThoughts,0,1.0,False

1hfz79v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hfz79v/the_invention_of_hunger/,The Invention of Hunger ,"I know this may sound laughable, but sometimes being richer than God is challenging. Emotionally, I mean.

Being incalculably wealthy since the day you were born can make life…flavorless. I’ve indulged in every imaginable depravity. I’ve ingested the cutting edge in mood-altering alchemy. I want for nothing.

And yet, I’m unhappy. Or maybe unhappy isn’t the right word - I’m indifferently indifferent. Hollow is pretty close, but isn’t exactly it.

It’s difficult to have never known hunger. I’ve tried to feed myself a great many things, but, apparently, I have no appetite for reality.

Until this most recent experiment.

I figured - some poor people seem happy. Maybe pretending to live like them will awaken some dormant hunger within myself.

After two weeks, I was ready to call the experiment a wash. But then there was this moment. I was at a local coffee shop, and I felt a smoldering warmth inside my chest. The sensation was so foreign that I genuinely believed I spilled coffee on my suit at first.

I watched the barista cheerily hand another patron their drink. A custodian walked by me who had a very peculiar melancholy about him. The temperature in the shop was crisp but not sweltering.

The experience was perfect. Transcendent, even. A quiet, beautiful comfort. Like I was inside an oil painting.

But when that warmth dissipated, I wanted more.

So, I bought the coffee shop. Bought every business on that street, actually - for privacy's sake. Filled the shop with paid actors, provided them direction and a script in order to recreate the moment. But it wasn’t the same.

An easy fix, I thought.

Local cops on my payroll pulled CC-TV footage from that day, which allowed me to determine exactly who was in the shop when I was.

I hired those exact people to come back to the coffee shop - my assistant told them it was for a “documentary”. At the rates I was paying, though, I could have told them they were coming to watch me castrate myself. No one would have batted an eye.

My assistant did neglect to mention they would be there for as long as I wanted them to be.

Three months later, something still wasn’t right. I couldn’t put my finger on it.

Maybe skinning the custodian’s family alive was *too* upsetting. I didn’t make him watch, though, I just told him that it happened, figuring that may be a happy middle-ground to reinvigorate his peculiar melancholy without breaking his mind.

I’ve had to re-cast the custodian, unfortunately.

Today, however, it finally hit me. It wasn’t the custodian’s demeanor after all. It was the way the barista looked - she was slightly off from how I remembered her.

Since that perfect day, the woman had undergone a nose job. That’s what was off.

I waved Gregor over, who will be assisting in reverting that change.

A hollow smile slinked across my face.

Soon - I would be warm and full again.",7,1734398474.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

I really love her—she’s absolutely gorgeous, way out of my league looks-wise, and the sweetest, most supportive person I’ve ever had. My family isn’t great, and she’s been my rock through everything.

That being said, over time, I’ve noticed she has some really weird eating habits. She eats super little, skips meals, and is really picky with food. At first, when I asked her about it, she’d just brush it off, but after she fainted a couple of times, I got mad and demanded to know what was going on. She finally admitted she’s scared of being fat (she’s nowhere close to overweight).

When we went on a trip to Mexico, I was watching her like a hawk, making sure she was eating every few hours, but even then, she’d only eat one small meal a day and drink coffee or energy drinks to keep going. She’s studying full-time, working out, and barely eating. She’s been to the hospital for fainting, and they said she might have an eating disorder. Even then, she refused food in the hospital. I told her she has to get help, but she says she doesn’t want to. I gave her an ultimatum—either she gets treatment or we break up.

She’s a high achiever, always excelling at uni, but it’s like the pressure is driving her into a spiral. She’ll study 20 hours a day for weeks, barely eat or sleep, ace her exams, and then immediately dive into nonstop partying, drinking. It’s like she’s constantly going back and forth between extremes, and she’s just… not okay. She’s not doing hard drugs but she’s smoking a lot of weed. And i mean a lot. She says it helps her to „calm down”. She also tried blow a few times but said she didn’t like it however i’m kinda scared she will do it again to lose weight or something. I heard about girls doing this to eat less and im scared about it. 


A few weeks ago, she hit rock bottom—she spent days in bed, crying, refusing to eat, saying she’s fat, and I literally had to force her to eat some bread. I brought up treatment again, and she said she’d do it “for me,” but I honestly think she needs inpatient treatment, not just a psychologist. She’s too far gone for outpatient to work, in my opinion.

Last week we had sex and she got a nose bleed. Mid fuck there was a blood everywhere. Honestly I got extremely scared. It happened a few times before but she said it’s because of the heating or something. Now she said it’s from stress and not eating. 
She told me she knows there is a problem, and she says will try her best to get better but she says she can’t do it on her own. 

I love her to death, but I need her to get better. She’s sweet, smart, and amazing, and I owe her so much for everything she’s done for me. I just want to help her. How do I convince her to go to inpatient treatment? I don’t want her to be scared, so can someone explain what these places are like? What happens there? What are the rules? Can I visit her? I want to be prepared so I can explain it all to her and help her feel less overwhelmed.

1hfz30z,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoreLink/comments/1hfz30z/goobers_lore/,Goobers Lore,"Goober is a 28-year-old femboy from Ontario, Canada, standing at 5’4”. With a playful spirit and an unmistakable flair for the whimsical, Goober loves to express himself through his colorful wardrobe, often donning bright, patterned tops and matching accessories. His vibrant personality is complemented by his gentle interest in the softer sides of life, such as arts and crafts, and a passionate adoration for all things Canadian—especially poutine, Tim Hortons coffee, and maple syrup. Goober's goofy charm and innocent demeanor, however, should not be mistaken for naivety; he harbors a fierce loyalty to his friends, family, and his beloved fighter jet, Maple.
Motivation and Goals:Goober's primary motivation stems from his profound desire to protect and serve his country, as well as his need for connection. He finds solace in his quirky relationship with Maple, his F-15 fighter jet, which he lovingly refers to as his pet. Goober aspires to earn a place in the hearts of his fellow squadron members while hoping to gain their respect as a pilot. He genuinely believes that if he cares for Maple like a true partner, the jet will reciprocate by soaring valiantly in the skies for him. Though he's inadvertently wandered into morally gray territories—engaging in dubious military operations—inside his heart, he seeks to be a hero for peace, or at least create a better world through what he thinks is service.
Significant Events: 
1. Flying Lessons: Goober's journey began at a young age when he watched air shows in awe. At 14, he took his first flying lesson, securing his ambition to join the RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force). It was an exhilarating experience that convinced him he was destined to soar through the skies.
2. Adoption of Maple: After graduating from the military academy, Goober was assigned to an F-15. He instantly cherished it, naming it Maple after his love for Canadian traditions. He began talking to it, treating it as a confidant rather than a machine, which raised eyebrows among his peers.
3. Military Deployment: During his deployment in the Middle East, Goober found himself embroiled in conflict. Losing sight of his initial values, he made risky decisions, engaging in questionable operations that led to serious consequences. While the details are blurry to him, they haunt him nonetheless.
4. Turning Point: After returning home on leave, Goober spent valuable time with family and friends, reflecting on his actions. An encounter with a veteran who had regret about war turned his perspective. He realized he needed to change and asked himself whether he could forge a new path while still being true to himself.
Relationships: 
* Maple: Goober's bond with Maple is both profound and unconventional. He treats the jet with affection and reverence—giving it affectionate nicknames, sharing secrets, and celebrating “birthdays” with treats made from maple syrup. This almost symbiotic relationship is the cornerstone of Goober’s emotional world.
* Squadron Mates: Despite being perceived as naïve, Goober is liked for his endearing nature. He maintains friendships with a few squad members who appreciate his quirks, though many see him as odd. A particular friendship with a fellow pilot, Alex, becomes significant; Alex serves as a mentor, encouraging Goober to consider the moral implications of his actions.
* Family: Goober’s supportive parents are quintessential Canadians who encouraged his love for aviation. Their disappointment in his military decision weighs heavily on him as he wishes to earn back their trust.
Growth and Change:Over the course of his journey, Goober confronts his self-deception about being a ""hero."" He grapples with the impact of his military service, coming face to face with the idea that he has potentially caused pain even while trying to protect. Through a desire for self-improvement, Goober begins engaging in discussions around military ethics, exploring ways to serve without forsaking his beliefs. He slowly transitions from a mindless soldier to a reflective individual who weighs the consequences of his actions. Ultimately, Goober wishes to redeem himself by using his voice to advocate for peace and ethical military practices, uniting his love for aviation with a new outlook that seeks to harmonize duty with compassion. 
In the end, Goober’s journey encapsulates a tale of love, loss, absurdity, and the path to understanding one's place in a complex world, all while maintaining his charm and delightfully Canadian spirit.",2,1734398120.0,LoreLink,0,1.0,False

","Hi all, doing the below solo and would appreciate some advice. Reasonably fit, cover ground pretty quickly, unfortunately speak 10 words of Spanish but will try to brush up on that over the next few weeks. Appreciate off the beaten path activities, something unique / local and love food.

9th Jan (Day 1) - leave Oaxaca. Overnight bus from Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca to San Cristobal de las Casas (SCDLC).

10th Jan (Day 2) - Arrive by bus around \~8am. Seems like the shuttles to Panajachel in Guatemela leave around 7am in the morning so might have to stay the day / night here in SCDLC. \*\*\*Anyone knows if the shuttles to Panajachel only run on weekdays? I've searched 3 companies and it's all Mon - Fri only

11th Jan (Day 3) - Stay in Lake Atitlan - Arrive late into to Panajachel. Stay the night here. To decide if I want to stay in Panajachel the whole time or move to San Pedro? I don't mind paying for somewhere slightly nicer.

12th Jan (Day 4) - Stay in Lake Atitlan - Explore nearby villages like San Juan La Laguna, San Pedro La Laguna, and Santiago Atitlán.

13th Jan (Day 5) - Stay in Lake Atitlan - day trip to Chichicastengo Market

14th Jan (Day 6) - Transfer and stay in Antigua - hike up to Cerro de la Cruz, maybe do a free walking tour, Mercado de Artesenías, explore rest of town

15th Jan (Day 7) - Stay in Antigua - TBC

16th Jan (Day 8) - Stay in Antigua - do hike of Acatenago. Given it's an overnight hike, do people check out of their acccommodation and just leave their stuff in the lockers / with the hotel? Any recommended operators? Seems like quite a few have good reviews so not sure if there's a big differentiating factor.

17th Jan (Day 9) - Stay in Antigua - De La Gente local coffee farm tour or chocolate tour

18th Jan (Day 10) - Stay in Antigua

19th Jan (Day 11) - Saturday Market in the morning before flight out at 6pm from Guatemala airport

Questions:

1. Will Day 5 take the whole day?
2. I tend to cover ground fairly quickly... what can I fill up with on Day 7 and 10?
3. Love food so appreciate any must-eats!

Thanks all.",1,1734398115.0,travel,0,1.0,False
1hfz2vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/EustachianTube/comments/1hfz2vy/eustachian_tube_dysfunction_tinnitus_recovery/,Eustachian tube dysfunction tinnitus recovery,"I’ve had this problem for over a month now. It first started when I got a really bad head cold and I became very congested in my sinuses. As a disclaimer I’ve always blown my nose hard throughout my life. One day my right nostril was completely out of action with no air coming in and out so I pushed my left side in blew my nose really hard then all of sudden I heard 2 massive whooshes and a pop in both ears. Instantly my right ear went dull and both ears started to ring immensely. I got worried so I ran a bath with tiger balm to help clear my congestion, with that I thought it was a bright idea to put my head under the water to relieve the noise ringing in my head because I just needed to hear silence. This was the biggest mistake I made!

When I got out of the bath I had the most excruciating pain/headache shoot to my frontal lobe under my right eyebrow. I almost felt like I was about to have a stroke as my eyes went blurry, arms went floppy and my speech was slurred with immense pain down the right side of my face. I then started pushing and working the pressure around my face down to the top of my nose and under my right eye where all of my sinus tubes flow. I blew my nose once again and the brightest mucus came out of my nose but at the same time both of my ears were popping and squeaking. It definitely relieved the pressure built up.

I tried to ride out a couple days at home thinking things were going to get better but the ringing was literally consuming my every thought. I tried to equalise using the “valsalva manoeuvre” but I had nothing but rips squeaks and pops from both sides. That’s when I realised I had developed tinnitus! I went to the hospital where they checked both ears, my left side was perforated and both ear drums were slightly inverted but that explained why I developed that bad pressure because the water had entered my canals. If this happens to you avoid any contact with water in your ears. I developed a sticky like glue see through mucus behind my ears and it literally clogs your eustachian tubes which creates  an unbalance in pressure between your ears. 

Recovery and exercise!

The main thing u need to do is unblock those tubes. Take a decongestant like Sudafed to break down the mucus and get it flowing out of your nose. Blow your nose very gently avoiding to damage those eardrums anymore. Take an antihistamine like an anti inflammatory to stop the swelling of these tubes like Claritin. Suck on boiled sweets to help pull the mucus out. Yawn as much as possible to allow air to push through the tubes, you’ll hear little clicks when air is entering and passing through. Massage the back of your ears there should be a little groove between the back of the ear and jaw that’s where ur tubes are. Cup both of your hands over your ears and flick the back of your head under the bump for 20 seconds, do this as much as 5 times It will help relieve the ringing and it works! Cover one nostril and take deep breathes through your nose multiple times in and out. Sit up right and even try to sleep upright like in a recliner this will allow the tubes to clear. Your head is like a bowling ball if it’s weighing down on your tubes it will keep them blocked. Your diet and lifestyle can also be a big effect on your tubes. No smoking, no coffee, no carbs u need to stop anything that can give you inflammation. Have hot baths/showers. Keep yourself busy with exercise and try to distract yourself as much as possible. With time this will help. It’s not going to happen over night!!

I know it’s hard getting to grips with something like this. You will be contemplating life a lot during this time. Don’t give up. I’m just under a month in and still experiencing all the symptoms but this has definitely helped me get through so far. With tinnitus It can go away or it might stay with you for life all depending how much you’ve damaged your ears. The brain is very complex, because your ears can’t pick up the tone/frequency it will replace it and that’s what you’re hearing. Over time your brain will be more accustomed to it just like when ur breathing and getting noises within the stomach. If you focus on the ringing it will consume you. Train yourself to have acceptance and push it to the back of your mind because it’s not going to go away. Listen to podcasts when in bed. Go for walks in nature stay active and things will get better. Hopefully this Terrible situation will resolve itself for both of us. If you ever want to talk just message me. I will continue to update this thread as time goes on. Keep your chin up and stay positive so many ppl are experiencing the exact same thing you’re not alone!",1,1734398110.0,EustachianTube,0,1.0,False

I really love her—she’s absolutely gorgeous, way out of my league looks-wise, and the sweetest, most supportive person I’ve ever had. My family isn’t great, and she’s been my rock through everything.

That being said, over time, I’ve noticed she has some really weird eating habits. She eats super little, skips meals, and is really picky with food. At first, when I asked her about it, she’d just brush it off, but after she fainted a couple of times, I got mad and demanded to know what was going on. She finally admitted she’s scared of being fat (she’s nowhere close to overweight).

When we went on a trip to Mexico, I was watching her like a hawk, making sure she was eating every few hours, but even then, she’d only eat one small meal a day and drink coffee or energy drinks to keep going. She’s studying full-time, working out, and barely eating. She’s been to the hospital for fainting, and they said she might have an eating disorder. Even then, she refused food in the hospital. I told her she has to get help, but she says she doesn’t want to. I gave her an ultimatum—either she gets treatment or we break up.

She’s a high achiever, always excelling at uni, but it’s like the pressure is driving her into a spiral. She’ll study 20 hours a day for weeks, barely eat or sleep, ace her exams, and then immediately dive into nonstop partying, drinking. It’s like she’s constantly going back and forth between extremes, and she’s just… not okay. She’s not doing hard drugs but she’s smoking a lot of weed. And i mean a lot. She says it helps her to „calm down”. She also tried blow a few times but said she didn’t like it however i’m kinda scared she will do it again to lose weight or something. I heard about girls doing this to eat less and im scared about it. 


A few weeks ago, she hit rock bottom—she spent days in bed, crying, refusing to eat, saying she’s fat, and I literally had to force her to eat some bread. I brought up treatment again, and she said she’d do it “for me,” but I honestly think she needs inpatient treatment, not just a psychologist. She’s too far gone for outpatient to work, in my opinion.

Last week we had sex and she got a nose bleed. Mid fuck there was a blood everywhere. Honestly I got extremely scared. It happened a few times before but she said it’s because of the heating or something. Now she said it’s from stress and not eating. 
She told me she knows there is a problem, and she says will try her best to get better but she says she can’t do it on her own. 

I love her to death, but I need her to get better. She’s sweet, smart, and amazing, and I owe her so much for everything she’s done for me. I just want to help her. How do I convince her to go to inpatient treatment? I don’t want her to be scared, so can someone explain what these places are like? What happens there? What are the rules? Can I visit her? I want to be prepared so I can explain it all to her and help her feel less overwhelmed.

I don’t have the muscle to sit comfortably and have muscle/joint pain every single damn day. Ive been reduced to essentially just..a skeleton it feels like. I’ve never been insecure about being tiny/skinny but my god my life long malnutrition feels like it’s catching up to me. I’ve never ever dieted or cared to count calories or restrict food.  I feel disgusting now. I cry a lot about being skinny vs. back then I would take every chance to show off my figure. You can see every detailed corner and curve of my sternum bones.. 
no doctor ever took me seriously, saying it was psychosomatic, which yes anxiety and other life stressors did effect it but not for 10+ years. 
FINALLY got a psychiatrist to take me seriously but not before bawling and breaking down about my baseline depression/sleep/eating issues for the past 10+ years. I’m not even a high functioning depressed person anymore. I’m getting sloppy in work, social relations, life “goals”, appearance (HUGE red flag for me)etc. 

Anyways he immediately started me on 15mg. 

I am fully aware I have to actually eat on these meds & I will be trying my best but with ALLL this being said…are there any tips you can give someone who’s starting this new?

Never been on antidepressants before and I’ve been sh*t at taking my adderall which I start late August. The depression and anxiety doesn’t really allow the adhd meds/focus to work consistently. One exacerbates the other and back and forth.

as someone incredibly unlucky and down the past few years, nobody associates with me anymore. everyone leaves me on delivered, even when i ask how they are. i’ll invite someone to hangout, they’ll reject the invitation and then go hangout with others and post about it. if someone’s feeling “kind” they might give me a 1 hour coffee date on a Monday night. I have always been mindful to keep my discussions of my situation to a minimum, to avoid negativity. when i lost my job and had trouble with the current job market, people stopped asking me to hangout. when i had two failed surgeries this year, people stopped asking how i am. now that my health has declined even worse, i have no contacts in my life anymore. they’ve all slowly faded away after pitying my situations and then treated me differently. this is very difficult as a 25 yo woman who desires the sanity of companionship and friends. this feels like a negative feedback loop that is nearly impossible to escape from. when i think about it — if i somehow miraculously had a change of luck, i wouldn’t want to associate with me or people like me either, I’d want to get away from it. i add nothing to the table anymore, i have no network that would entice another person my age to stay in contact with me. my health and career struggles have just compounded onto each other, and now i’m basically a shut in. i was never this way to this degree in my entire life, and it hurts so badly. i’ve also learned that some people i have known through my life aren’t real friends to discard me like this. what is one to do in my situation — or do i just accept a loner life confined to the outskirts of society?

M/25, F/23","I'm a male in my 20s, currently working in aviation in Europe, and I just broke up with my ex (female, also in her 20s) due to a lot of disagreements, mainly about finances.

A bit of backstory (I'll keep it somewhat vague to protect my privacy, of course):  
We met over the internet last summer when she texted me through an app in 2023. We started chatting, got interested in each other right away, and after a few months of texting, I decided to fly to her country to meet her. I spent a week there, and while some moments were pleasant, we also had some serious discussions too, mainly about the future. Since I was serious about the relationship from the start and, I wanted to know how my partner viewed certain aspects of life.

Our disagreements were mostly about finances. In her country, men are expected to pay for everything, there's no concept of any kind of 50/50, even as friends. Men are also expected to have a house before proposing, get down on one knee, no sex before marriage, etc. You get the point.

Anyway, I shared my views as well. Being an immigrant myself and having the same shit on going back home but growing up in Europe since I was a child, I see things differently. I value equality **A LOT**. Since she moved to Europe this September, I did a lot to help her. I gave her and her best friend my travel benefits through my airline so they wouldn't have to spend money on flights. I tried to ease some of her financial stress by anticipating admission fees for various universities across the country. I got half of it back, but she still owes me some money. It’s not a huge amount, but it’s symbolic.

I drove around the city where she eventually decided to study, looked for apartments for her and her best friend, and talked to the owners since people here don’t really speak English. Once she arrived, we lived in almost the same city, I'm closer to the airport for work, and she lives closer to the university.

During her time here, I showed her love and understanding. She wanted to visit certain places, we did. She wanted to try new foods, we did. She would send me Instagram reels of things she wanted to experience, and we tried those too, all at my expense of course. I even took her some famous spots in the county and in the mountains for her birthday and celebrated at a Michelin star restaurant because she loved the view from its window, surprised her with a cake that she knew nothing about while everyone was singing happy birthday.

Yet, despite all of this, she never even bought me a cup of coffee or even ask me. Every time she came to my place, I would pick her up, and she was always hungry so we’d always go out to get food (again, at my expense). She never cooked at my place except for pancakes once or twice. I mostly cooked and washed the dishes while we talked about shared responsibilities, something she agreed to but never followed through on.

(I realize now that I sound like one of those guys on the internet whose stories I always used to feel sorry for. Funny how life works—I’ve become them.)

Anyway, I made sure she had everything she needed to feel comfortable at my place towels, slippers, pajamas, menstrual pads, a teddy bear, fresh sheets, a clean house, and heated house since she’s always cold. I listened to her vent about her day, her gossip, and her disappointments, and I always gave her feedback.

When it came to intimacy, we could only masturbated each other since she wanted no sex before marriage which I respected because I valued her choices. I always made sure she was pleasured, she was relaxed first. I did all of this only to get broken up with over a **text message**, where she called me “ungrateful” for what she’s done for me.

I never asked for big surprises, gifts, or expensive dinners. I always appreciated small gestures. I just wanted to feel that my partner cared for me too. For example, I didn’t expect her to take me to a fancy restaurant—just buying me a €1.50 burger from McDonald's or randomly asking if I wanted a coffee would have been enough. I never made her pay for anything, nor did I ask but is it really **too much** to expect some consideration from your partner? She knew about this as i expressed that i want to be treated too sometimes.

She got mad when I pointed out the hypocrisy of her paying for things when she’s with her girlfriends but refusing to do the same for me. I mean, it’s okay to treat your friends, but not your partner? Hmm…

After the breakup text, she messaged me to arrange an exchange of belongings. I agreed and asked her for the money she owed me, money she had promised to pay back when she first arrived in Europe (a deadline **she** set for herself). Instead of responding, she blocked me on every social media platform.

There’s a lot more, but I don’t want to get too deep into it. If anyone has questions, I’m happy to answer.

**Now for the main part:**

She recently booked a 3–4 day vacation with her girlfriends to a beautiful place in Europe. The tickets for their flights are, of course, my travel benefits.

So if I cancel their flights **before** they depart?   
Or  I cancel **only the return flight** once they’re already there?

This would be **f**irst step

Second step would involve contacting her landlord to explain how, in my view, she used me to settle down here and then decided to cut me off entirely.

The **last step** would be filing an official complaint with the police, presenting all the proof I have, admission fees I paid, receipts, messages, etc.",1,1734397443.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

I’m so happy and grateful to this sub for any advice so wanted to reciprocate what I can for any other nervous test takers :) 

1. Utilise the gov.uk website as much as possible to ease nerves! They have great videos on the show me / tell me questions which act as a great way to revise 

2. Go out and try & associate positive connotations with driving (even practicing for 10 minutes - ie manoeuvres - is still practicing and helpful!!!)

3. Have a lesson before your test/practice before your test! My test was quite early but I do not regret my 7am lesson as it helped calm my nerves on the way to the centre 

4. If you have an instructor, USE THEIR KNOWLEDGE!! Ask them ANYTHING about the test that you’re unsure of. I must have asked my instructor 100 questions to ease my nerves and any unpredictable things that may occur during the test 

5. Look, I ate a banana before my test and it worked, and I had coffee too, which got me through! 

6. Don’t get too caught up in the online driving world. For all those over-thinkers, stop comparing yourself to other people’s learning journeys. We are all so different and unique in our ways, set on very different paths. You’ve got this! 

7. Don’t tell anyone about the test to ease pressure :) plus, when you pass, you can surprise your family with the news! Best feeling ever! 

8. BREATHE! If your instructor thinks you can pass, you can. You will have another chance, it’s not the end of the world if you don’t pass.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay, geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

I’ve been featured on the news here in the area.

I’m moving to ATL for a job downtown and need some help figuring out where to live.
