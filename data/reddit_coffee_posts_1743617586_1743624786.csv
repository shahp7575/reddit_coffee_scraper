I love having coffee dates with her, I love family and friends meeting her, and I love going out with my husband with her and enjoying the little family we’ve created. I didn’t realize how many people were against taking babies out. My husband and I are going out tonight to celebrate our friend’s baby’s birthday and my MIL said, “Don’t take her out, keep her with me.”, when I said it’s fine, I’d love for them to meet my baby, she told me it’s an unnecessary outing. Then, my SIL messaged me and said she isn’t going to this family and friends gathering we’re having this weekend and texted me, “I can babysit the baby, so you don’t have to take her around jealous and ill people.” And it made me feel weird, because I don’t want her around that, but at the same time, I’m excited to take her and have everyone finally meet her. It’s like, I want her healthy and sure, maybe I shouldn’t take her out much to prevent her from getting sick, but I just enjoy being out with her so much; it’s like my life before her never truly ended and she’s just a new friend in my life that I hang with.

1jpye15,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpye15,"Overnight Camp on the Cutler Coast, Maine USA","
In September 2024 I went out on a solo overnight backpacking trip on the downeast coast of Maine.
The views from the trail heading in were immaculate. (pics 1 & 2)
Once I reached camp I took in the sunset from on the rocks and enjoyed an exquisite meal. (Pics 3, 4 & 5)
It was a clear night, I left the roof off of my tent and stared at the stars for hours while lying down.
Sunrise was pretty amazing, with some low clouds making for dramatic skies as the sun kept rising behind them. I enjoyed some coffee and donuts on the rocks watching the shadows of the clouds move across the rocks and the water. (Pics 6 & 7)
The forest trail on the way back was pretty overgrown in some parts with a decent amount of down trees on the trail, some you could walk around and some you had to crawl underneath of, but that just added to the fun.
A few instances of bushwhacking through high shrubs and trees on that part of the trail also but nothing too crazy depending on your comfort level. Other than those spots the rest of the forest trail was great, l'm a big fan of forest walks. 
Saw one rather large pile of bear scat about midway through the forest return trail but no other sign of wildlife aside from seagulls up until that point.
Total distance was just over 10 miles roundtrip
Elevation gain was around 500 feet daily (≈ 1000 total)

I’ve recently been trying to get into espresso and for the life of me I can’t get it right. 

I’ve had a Delonghi Dedica for a few years now but only recently purchased a bottomless portafilter for it as opposed to the pressurized basket. 

No matter what variations I try, all my shots come out with this tongue twisting sourness/bitter taste. I know that sour and bitter are two completely different tastes and can mean under and over extraction, but as I don’t have a lot of experience, I can’t decide which one it is. 

I’ve tried going to either extremes to try and identify if it is sour or bitter by varying but I still get the same sort of taste. 

I’ve gone through around 3 small bags of beans to test the following variations:

Dosages: Ranging from 14g to 20g

Ratios: 1:~1.5 to 1:3

Extraction times: 15s to over a minute 

Grind settings: Have mostly been varied along with the extraction times so I’ve gone from way too coarse to too fine and blocking the machine. 

Temperatures: I’ve tried all 3 of the Dedicas temperature settings going up to pulling blank shots to heat it up along with the steam button and back to brew. 

Beans: Blends as well as single origins and Dark, Medium and Medium Dark. 

I’m using a generic manual conical burr grinder with stainless steel burrs. I use a stirrer and distributor before tamping for even extraction. 

The water I use is distilled and from a water shop which I have in 18l bottles from a dispenser. I gone far enough to test it or adjust for things like lime content but it’s the best water I’ve found so far. 

At this point I’m not sure what else I could try. I feel like the taste should have changed by now through all of these variations or at least point me in the right direction but all my shots are still undrinkable when not in a cappuccino or an americano. 

I’ve seen other Reddit posts from people enjoying the coffee out of this machine and from others with similar issues. One post mentioned switching from the generic basket that came with the portafilter to an IMS basket but they are currently out of stock.

So me (26M) and my coworker (22M) have gotten quite close over the past few months.

Before you cancel me, yes we work together, yes I know the risks. We're in different departments anyways.

It's been a few months of chatting, coaching a cricket team together (we're teachers, but he's in an intern position) and I find him really attractive. Not just physically, but he's just so nice to be around. Magnetic. 

I asked him out for coffee on Tuesday and he said yes. It was nice. He was busy with something prior but made time anyway. This has been building for a while since at work we constantly lock eyes and chat - he always comes up to me and vice versa. It's a good friendship but I can feel a lot of tension. 

He's been reacting to my texts with hearts too.

After the date we shook hands and he smiled softly and winked at me. 

I think I'm gonna ride this out for now and not jump the gun until it feels right, but my intuition is telling me he feels at least some interest in me.

At first, the goal was simple: earn enough in dividends to cover something small, like coffee or lunch. So I picked a few solid companies, invested what I could, and reinvested every dollar I got. 

It was slow. Sometimes it felt pointless (specially from start), but I stuck with it.

Month by month, the numbers grew and started to compound.

Now my portfolio pays me over $47,000 a year—almost $4,000 every month. That’s money coming in whether I work or not.

This didn’t happen overnight. But it did happen—because I stayed consistent and didn’t quit.

If you’re thinking about starting, just start. Even small steps add up.

Baratza has now come up with excuses... I mean a justifications for the fact the burr holder easily cracks, including: 

* ""The burr holder is actually designed to be the weakest point in your grinder in order to protect the more expensive components""
* ""The burr holder is prone to breakage with harder, denser beans"" (um..wut?)
* ""because coffee is an agricultural product little rocks and screws can sometimes find their way into your bags of roasted beans""
* ""if your grinder hits an un-roasted bean it can cause damage to the internal parts of the machine""

The burr holder's are $5 each, with free shipping if you spend $75. So far Baratza sent them at no charge; but if the day comes where I have to pay for shipping I'm not going to be happy and may have to invest in a different unit. I suspect I'm not the only person with this problem, because Baratza goes (literally) months at a time being out of stock. This last time they were out of stock for 4-months, which means I had a Baratza brick sitting on my counter for 4 months. 

Anyway, that's my review of the ESP. Make of it what you will.

I just ordered the Ikea Kivik sofa in the color below and I would like something to put my feet up on but something that is easily moved when working out, Not too heavy, etc.

Is it worth buying the ottoman for my space or do I get two pouf ottomans?

Looking for experience with the ottoman and if it's worth the money.

PS I live alone with occasional company.

The ottoman matches my sofa

The 1st pic is my space where the couch is going

The 2nd is the sofa at Ikea but I only purchased the sofa and pillows in this color but not the ottoman

The 3rd is the pouf I'm thinking of getting if no ottoman

My renewal starts 8/16 and goes until 7/31/2026. The Lofts is a fully furnished apartment complex with a pool, gym, clubhouse, delivery service, dog park, free WIFI, and monthly events and giveaways. My apartment has two floors both of which have a very spacious living area. You would have your own bathroom and walk-in closet. Rent includes everything at **1,097$ including a personal parking spot** right in front of the apartment. It is barely ten minutes away from campus and Waterford lakes. We have two shuttle spots in our neighborhood and are a walkable distance from a shopping plaza, that has a gym, Popeyes, coffee shops, and more. My roommates are planning on moving out too, so If you are looking for a place to stay with a friend this would be perfect! There are plenty of lakes in the neighborhood which make for great study spots. I can pay for registration costs and any costs of moving in (if you need to rent a trailer, etc.). I have loved this apartment for over a year, I just have a better opportunity with a friend closer to where I need to be.

1jpy0hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TurnKeyDirectories/comments/1jpy0hh/6_steps_to_build_a_successful_business_directory/,6 Steps to Build a Successful Business Directory from Scratch,"## 6 Steps to Build a Profitable Business Directory Website

Hey r/TurnKeyDirectories! After working with multiple successful directory websites, I've noticed that many entrepreneurs don't realize the potential goldmine of creating niche business directories. With the right approach, you can build a valuable platform that connects businesses with customers while generating multiple revenue streams.

**Here's my proven six-step process to create a profitable directory website:**

## 1. Research Your Market Thoroughly

The most successful directories identify gaps that larger players aren't filling. Don't try to be the next Yelp! Instead:

* Create detailed buyer personas for both businesses and users
* Analyze competitor strengths/weaknesses using tools like SEMrush
* Look for pain points in existing directories (many businesses hate getting lost among national chains)

## 2. Choose a Profitable Niche

Being the big fish in a small pond beats being invisible in the ocean! Some profitable niches include:

* Industry-specific directories (legal, healthcare, financial)
* Location-based directories for underserved areas
* Specialized service directories (pet services, home renovation)
* Directories for specific demographics (women-owned businesses)

The key is finding niches with enough businesses to list but not so saturated that you can't differentiate.

## 3. Select the Right Platform

Your tech stack matters! WordPress remains popular for directories because of its flexibility and plugin ecosystem. Consider:

* Development time and budget
* Required features (payment gateways, review systems)
* Long-term scalability needs
* Your technical comfort level

If you want to avoid technical headaches, check out [TurnKeyDirectories.com](https://turnkeydirectories.com/) - they offer a complete solution that handles all the technical aspects so you can focus on growing your business.

## 4. Develop Multiple Monetization Channels

The most successful directories don't rely on just one revenue stream. Consider:

* **Freemium models** - basic listings free, premium features paid
* **Sponsored placement** for businesses wanting more visibility
* **Affiliate partnerships** with relevant service providers
* **Banner advertising** for complementary businesses
* **Lead generation fees** for high-value niches

I've seen directory revenues increase by 40%+ simply by adding secondary monetization channels!

## 5. Optimize for SEO and User Experience

A directory without visitors provides zero value. Focus on:

* Two-pronged SEO: directory-level keywords AND business-specific terms
* Clean URL structure (domain.com/location/category/business-name)
* Mobile optimization (60%+ of local searches happen on mobile)
* Fast loading speeds and intuitive navigation
* Smart filtering options relevant to your niche

Remember: directories face extra scrutiny from search engines, so focus on quality content and ethical SEO.

## 6. Launch with a Strong Marketing Strategy

Don't make the rookie mistake of launching with empty categories! Instead:

* Create a pre-launch landing page to collect emails
* Offer early-bird specials or lifetime discounts to founding businesses
* Personally reach out to potential listings (face-to-face works amazingly well)
* Develop content marketing that serves both businesses and users
* Build community through social media groups where businesses and customers interact

**Pro tip:** When I helped launch a directory for independent coffee shops, personal visits resulted in a 70% conversion rate vs. just 10% from emails.

## Maintain and Scale

Post-launch, focus on:
* Regular verification of business information
* Feature updates based on user feedback
* Monitoring analytics to understand user behavior
* Expanding to complementary niches or locations

1jpxzq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/1jpxzq3/how_do_i_make_my_boyfriend_realize_he_needs_to/,How do I make my boyfriend realize he needs to take this new job?,"Background: We are both mid twenties, ambitious, and are on a debt-free path to FIRE. Currently we make a combined $104k after taxes and deductions a year. We save $65-76k a year depending on if our cars or house needs maintenance (oof to needing a new roof AND a new HVAC in the same year 🥲). We’re debt free besides our mortgage so our bills are very very low. 

The problem: a job opportunity has come up for him to make our combined income $120k after taxes and deductions a year. I want him to take it. Buuuut the boss is a man who’s assaulted me. Not sexually, he just hit me. I work in the trades. Men are incredibly hostile and cruel here, it’s not uncommon for men to try and scare me off by sexually or physically assaulting me. I refuse to be threatened tho. I hit him back so hard he fell to the ground and threatened to get him jumped if he tried it again. He’s left me alone since, but he’s always glaring at me and staring at me. I hate him. Regardless, money is money and I’m no spring chicken. No one knows my boyfriend and I are together, we don’t advertise our relationship because we’re worried about making it seem like I’m on the out or close to marriage therefore kids. The woman they fired and hired me to replace was done so because she kept calling off to take care of her kids. 

I have a ticking fertility clock and before my boyfriend and I can get married we have to pay off our debt, his desire. And before we have kids we have to get married, my desire. We have already gone through a miscarriage and it was traumatic for both of us. I cannot work this job and be pregnant. It’s too dangerous and stressful. My body cannot maintain pregnancy and worse it’s scared my boyfriend into never having sex with me. I understand he’s terrified and I get it, I’m not holding our dead bedroom against him because he’s still overwhelmingly affectionate and sweet. He still brings me coffee in the mornings, makes me breakfast, and cuddles with me. The lack of sex sucks, but I miscarried while he was in another state for work all by myself and he has never forgiven himself. I bled everywhere and he came home to me cleaning the blood up and sobbing hysterically. It was horrible and I’m also still kind of shaken by it. This is why I want it so bad. I’m 26. He’s 27. We just need to keep saving for 5-6 more years and we’ll be able to FIRE. If he takes this next job we can make it closer to 4 or 5. The sooner we can pay off our mortgage, retire, get married, and I can start having kids the better. I just. I dunno. Nothing I say can convince him to take this job. He hates the man, which I find fair, but I think he’s being short sighted. How do I make him understand this is what’s best for us and our family? That our fertility window is short and if we want to have 2-3 kids the sooner we start the better? 

We love each other and are SO excited for the next chapter we’re both working so hard to create together, but it just feels like he’s letting ego stunt our growth. Maybe I’m the one who’s being short sighted? I don’t know. We both hate our jobs so it’s not like he has job satisfaction. We are just doing what we can to make what we need so we can live the life we actually want to live. Maybe I’m just having baby fever? I loved being pregnant. I loved the way my body changed. I loved knowing I was creating our family. I cannot wait to be a mom and I’m having a hard time finding the will to wait. I know men don’t think about these things but it’s a nightmare for me to have to be pregnant at 40. I want kids now but it’s not realistic. I know that. But god. I just. I want babies and to be a sahw and to cuddle my babies all day. I’m sick of this, but I also don’t want him to suffer. I want us both to FIRE so he can also stay home and we can both cuddle our babies. I want him there for their first steps and their first words. We get that sooner if he just takes this job. It’s so frustrating.

We’ve seen stores lose critical labor, partners take on extra responsibility without extra pay, and have been promised offensively small year over year raises, all while the CEO was compensated over $100m in his first months with the company. Not to mention how gender affirming care was silently removed from the health plan despite the company vocally presenting themselves as “progressive”. By supporting Starbucks, customers are telling the company that this behavior, this treatment of its workers is acceptable. Corporations don’t change unless they feel pressure, and upholding the status quo certainly isn’t doing that.

And I don’t want to hear anyone say “no ethical consumption under capitalism”, this is Starbucks, not your smartphone, grocery store, or car. There are SO many independent and local coffee shops who pay their workers fair wages and properly staff their store, there’s no excuse unless you live in the middle of nowhere where other options don’t exist.

Side: This is why organizing in the present day is so difficult, people don’t care enough to make even the simplest changes to their habits/ behaviors even if it helps workers. Amazon literally opened a fire hydrant on organizing workers in Brooklyn during near-freezing temperatures but that didn’t stop people from keeping their Amazon prime subscription. We’ve known that Elon Musk was a shitty, corrupt man since forever and people still threw money at his company for a car that is more of a status symbol than anything. I no longer have energy for these people, sorry. The internet is free and in this present day we have to be organized against the ever growing evil in this country before it inevitably consumes us.

This is the first time I’ve put any amount of effort into my sobriety. I was a functional drunk. Although I drank nearly a fifth of vodka a day for the last few years before sobriety, I could always afford alcohol while maintaining a pretty comfortable lifestyle and I work in the bar/service industry so I got away with using limited potential at bars where I could stay drunk. I’ve had sporadic issues with my hands off and on for a few years now and always brushed it off as bar rot. The past 6 months it has been extremely painful and there are basically smallholes in my hands that aren’t open wounds but just missing skin. After being to 5/6 different doctors I just got diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome. I was told I have to stop taking my Adderall Rx, stop smoking cigarettes, and stop drinking coffee. I’m only on 15mg of Adderall a day, smoke 10 cigs tops, and drink 3/4 cups of coffee. I gave up redbull a few weeks ago. That on top of a lot of medication to open my blood vessels. This all sounds petty and like small inconveniences, but it’s so fucking frustrating. I’m not impulsive anymore- that went out the window along with my emotions and everything else that made me exciting before sobriety. But it does make me want to almost plan my relapse. At this point I’d rather live 5-10 more years getting fucked up than 40 more years stagnant with absolutely nothing to look forward to. I’m 35, attractive, single, no children, make great money, and have awesome social skills when I’m interested. I know I would lose most of that in time, but I have had acute pancreatitis so I don’t expect to live long enough to face the consequences long term after going back to the bottle. I have incredible friends, but all of their lives would be okay without me. I’m no one’s particular “person”. I don’t have a bad life. I stay a sold 5 on the happy scale. I just don’t think life is worth living without the highs and the lows. I miss the fucking excitement that just doesn’t happen with sobriety. ",2,1743623153.0,stopdrinking,2,0.75,False

First forget the professionals, their needs are different.  And also, I don't mean hobbyist who need an exact piece for their main project (such as authors needing a book cover).

I mean hobbyist who enjoy the generative art part for its own sake. And for those of us like that, chatgpt has never been FUN. 

Here are my reasons why that is so,

1. Long wait time! By the time the image comes up, I seem to get distracted by other stuff.

2. No multi generates! Similiar to the previous one really, I like generating a bunch of images that look different from the prompt, rather than one.

3. No creative surprises! I'm not selling products online, I don't care about how real they can make a woman hold a bag while drinking coffee. I want to prompt something 10 times, and have then all look a bit different from my prompt so each output seems like a surprise!

Finally, what open sources provide are variety.  The more models and loras, the more you are able to combine them into things that look unique. 

I don't want exact replicas of what people used to make. I want outputs that appear to be generative visuals that are creative and new.

I wrote this because it seems a lot of ""open source is doomed"" seem to miss the group of people who love the generative part of it, the way words combined with datasets seem to turn into new visual experiences. 

Also, while I'm here, I miss AI hands! Hands have gotten to good! Boring! ",3,1743623053.0,StableDiffusion,2,0.71,False
1jpxt7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1jpxt7c/breville_grind_control_coffee_maker_review_a/,Breville Grind Control Coffee Maker Review: A precautionary tale!,"There are so many issues with this coffee maker I don't know where to start.  Every morning brings a new issue to detect or mess to clean before enjoying a cup of coffee.  The short list: 1. Grounds overflow the filter basket into pot consistently  2. The grind burr works itself loose causing grounds to get more coarse overtime causing consumption of excessive grounds and lack of flavor 3. The pot must be literally turned upside down to get last cup of liquid out. It also does not keep coffee hot even if ""pre-heated"" with hot water as the instructions suggest. 

Please comment if you have experienced any of these issues or have any helpful advice. 

Let's dive into each of these.  

1. We have tried all variations of # cups, filter type, strength, and grind method.  Pre-ground method: If more than 4 cups (only 8 level tablespoons) is desired, the grounds overflow the filter basket.  Either the filter basket is not large enough or the machines method of brewing causes grounds to rise over the basket edge. The automated method ends in same issue wether using weak or strong settling, paper or metal filter. Why provide a 12 cup tank and pot if only 4 can be made without issue?  

2. Over weeks of use, the burr became loose and began making very coarse grounds. We were going through high quantities of beans before discovering the problem. After ensuring the burr was in locked position again, in a few weeks it started showing signs of happening again. 

3. The pot is the worst.  Its design is truly flawed forcing one to turn it upside down to get the last cup out.  In the process, coffee splatters everywhere.  In addition, instructions say to ""pre-heat"" it with hot water before brewing, but that just not practical.  There is a brew timer feature, meaning you can prep the machine the night before ,and wake up to the smell of fresh brewed coffee.  I don't want to beat the brew timer up just to prep the pot! 

We have contacted Breville asking for a return/refund letting them know of the design issues, and were basically told they don't issue refunds.  We're very surprised a ""high-end"" coffee maker would not support their product.  Our only recourse is taking it back to the business we bought it from and hoping they will take it back after 6 weeks of use trying to crack its code.  At the end of the day, it's a coffee maker.  I don't want to invest this much time and energy into a coffee maker ever again.  I've attached some pictures of the ongoing issues we experience.  

Please comment if you have experienced any of these issues or have any helpful advice. Thanks!

so far so good, the only thing I'm not sure about is to how to **think about my current dosing**. because Sustanon has in it's name 250mg as in 250mg of testosterone, however when you read the actual **leaflet from the medication**, it actually says the ampule (1 mL) contains **176mg of testosterone**. I assume that means 176mg of ""raw"" TST weight and the rest from the difference is the molecules making up the 4 esters.

so I'm not sure if I should think about myself as being on 175mg a week (250/10\*7) or rather 123mg a week (176/10\*7)? so far I don't want to change anything, just not sure how to think about this... I will ask my doctor at my scheduled appointment in two months but I'm curious

\-----  
  
as for progress, I already feel more energy, sense of well-being, better regeneration after the gym, less craving for booze and unhealthy foods, more desire to do...well fucking anything, including fucking.. but on the last note I presume the full benefits will reveal themselves over longer time period  
  
only downside is that three weeks in I started to overreact to caffeine. I used to drink 1-3 strong coffees a day for 15 years, now I take one at 11am and at midnight my heart is still racing like I just did a massive bump of coke, which prevents me from sleeping well.. I will kill coffee intake if need be, even though I do like coffee. I can live without it, but I cannot go back to be a walking corpse w/o TRT

\----

<rant>Sustanon is the only good medication you can get officially here in central Europe; well there's also the gel, which is bullshit and then Nebido (undecaonate), which I also think is bullshit for my application... I'd prefer going with cyp/eth, so it would be easier to find my groove, but whatever, I'm really glad I found a provider that will prescribe me what I need and understands the basics of the bloodwork, I had to go through 5 different endocrinologist/andrologists to find a doctor who fucking knows what is TRT about and who understands that I need it! terrible experience, I would not wish that on my mortal enemy, to struggle with cancer and then be constatnly turned away by doctors who don't know what the fuck they are doing because 20 years ago at the unit they told them TST is dangerous and only for the special cases of guys whose balls didn't actually drop bcs of a condition... </rant>

I'm also thinking on adding 5mg of tadalafil/cialis a day but I guess here I will have to turn to the black market, otherwise it's gonna break the bank... but you don't have to prick yourself with this, the risk here is smaller and worth taking I presume",1,1743622979.0,trt,2,1.0,False

I admit I do need to be better about these things.

Yet, sleeping on a softer mattress then I have at home I have no random stabbing pain, no ache during certain movements- honestly my lower back hasn't felt this good in a while.... I do have VERY minor scholiosis(sp?) and I am a side sleeper. Everywhere says firm mattress for back pain but this soft mattress makes me feel so good I question it. Do I really need a firm mattress?

I get  Acid reflux even if I drink WATER!! I could feel the acids coming up in my THROAT it was so weird for me cause my diet is clean why am I still having acid reflux maybe from the dates I ate or the too much bread I had or smoothie, i was sick 3 weeks ago went to END cause my voice was gone he gave me ppi panto i was like it could the panto made acid reflux i used it for 7 days
I went to my dr today and told him all about it im on day 9 clean diet could be the dates affected me ? He said no dates I have no problem with that, u must ate junk food coffee, chocolate, no I never did I didn’t break my diet except when I had dates and smoothie told me u still didn’t break it you must ate too much and slept that cause you that!!! 
Since ur diet is clean im thinking it could be stress u got sad or too happy had annoying dream ur mental affect ur stomach!! And also im thinking the issue is in your stomach something inside  not the dates u had he prescribed me ppi and muscle relaxation for gas and cramps 
Ppi 40mg 2x a day for 5 days then reduce it for 1x a day u could continue on it for the next month or two 
And 2x for the other medication 
If you still didn’t get better I’ll give u another medication and then after a month will have to do a hpylori re test just to make sure and gastroscopy to see. 
Told him I want to make my stomach acid strong when can I break my diet he said not now after 2 months ur good then break it after a month I have an appointment with him for a follow up. 

I know this is along post. 
It has been hard for me crying and feeling frustrated by this randomly getting burning sensation and I feel the acid coming up in my throat and I taste it smt I can’t sleep because of it I tried licorice root tea small amount didn’t help so I’m gonna start taking the meds tomorrow I know ppi is not ideal but i have to take the medicine he gave and hope for the best.

I thought he wanted to go on a date with me and wanted to getting to know me. So I thought well, why wait for when he's in my town again? I told him later on that I have time this weekend. He replied 1,5 hr later like 'uh, yeah that's possible'. I was very confused by his lack of enhtusiasm. I mean, he talked about meeting up and asked for my number but is now acting all surprised and weird. He did however say that he will come to my town and the next day there was a holiday so he did messaged me wishing me a happy holiday. What do you guys think about this?

Problem is I made a huge mistake that I kind of saw coming but went with anyway… I washed the ring burr with water and let it dry. 
Now it’s rusty, obviously, and I wanted to know if there exists any trick to remove the rust without damaging the burr enough to hinder its precision. 

I also saw that you can buy it online, on their website for example, but I’m in Europe so I’d have to find one here in order to avoid huge delivery costs. That’s why I’m looking for a repair before a replacement. Any advice welcome !

Finally while I’m here, I noticed that I’m not the only one encountering a problem when cleaning this grinder : the conical burr is supposed to be easy to take out by first turning and removing a little black piece at the top, but when I try to turn that black piece (yes, clockwise) the burr turns with it. I have seen a lot of comments about that issue but no answer from baratza for that specific problem. Any fix ?",1,1743622340.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I always felt guilty taking time off. 

I was having coffee with a friend once and telling him that I really needed to take a proper break and I had support from my doctor. My friend asked me “but where does that leave your manager?”. In the state that I was in I got quite frustrated, and explained that aside from the fact that my manager had a very high EQ and would be supportive - it’s my 30 years of prioritising my manager and what my workplace would think, I’m feeling like I owed them something - that was one of the contributors to my burnout in the first place. 
This feeling stops so many people from focusing on their health when they need to. 

I’d love to hear others thoughts on this. Do you feel this too and wish you could let go of that guilt?

I'm posting here again because I've met some incredible people that have been so amazing to talk to and I wanted to find even more of you! Yes I'm greedy😤  
I know this is primarily a dating subreddit but I was hoping to make some friends and figured why not do it within the community!  
I'd really like to get to know some ladies that are interested in a long-term friendship, sharing everything with each other and being supportive and really putting the effort in!  
I'm not interested in dating or anything sexual, I'm not opposed to something happening naturally if a friendship blossoms into more, but right now it's not something I'm ready for and I really don't know when I will be.  
So if you're okay with that and want to know what kind of person I am then read on and maybe I'll be intriguing in some way!🎉Preferably ladies around my age but don't be afraid to say hi if you'd like! You can also be anywhere in the world, any timezone, that's quite alright with me!

❤️I'm 32 years old, getting closer to 33 but not quite there yet, and I live in Ontario Canada. I'm going to be moving🚚 sometime this year, will be staying within Ontario but moving to a different city which is both exciting and terrifying because I've basically always lived in the same area my whole life.😰  
❤️I really like being expressive, sometimes I forget because I try to just get information out, but I use a lot of exclamation points and emojis because I like showing that ✨*flair*✨*and*✨*magic*✨  
❤️Along with that I try to be super positive and happy!😊The world sucks a lot and the last thing I want to do is add any negativity to anyone's life, let alone the people I care about. That doesn't mean I won't listen and be there for you when life is hard or you're in pain or you just need someone to hold you while you cry. I will always be there for you for everything, good and bad.💕  
❤️I will be your cheerleader and cheer on every amazing thing you do in your life!  
You aced an exam that was super important? Hell yeah! that's amazing and we should celebrate however would make you happy!  
You stood up to someone that was being an asshole? Amazing shit! that takes a lot of courage to do and you're awesome for that!  
You were able to brush your teeth today? Fuck yeah! You should be so proud of yourself because that can be so hard to do!  
❤️I have 1 kitty🐈‍⬛, a longhaired cutie of a void named Sasha! She's an absolute sweetheart and I love her so much! If you have any pets PLEASE tell me all about them, I want to hear you gush all your love for them! Also if you want to share pictures I would love to see your babies too! Cats, dogs, rabbits, rats, mice, snakes, bugs, doesn't matter to me! And if you don't have any pets but want them then I want to hear that too!  
❤️Really like video games, in a bit of a lull right now because I used to play a lot of competitive games like League of Legends, Rainbow 6 Siege, Apex Legends, etc, but now I don't and I'm not sure what to play, so I've been looking and I *THINK* I have some ideas sitting in my steam cart that I might buy.  
❤️I have ADHD, currently medicated and it has done WONDERS for my appetite, but for my actual issue with attention, ehhh not so much🙁but I'm working on it, hopefully I'll land on a medication that works for that and then I'll be unstoppable!🧱(probably not but one can hope!)  
❤️I looooove to sing🎤, like it's my ***all time favorite thing***! I am so jealous of those women with those gorgeous voices (this is an example of a voice I hope to sound like someday [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVRtM1x9wQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVRtM1x9wQ)). I'm taking lessons right now and my teacher has been wonderful so I'm looking forward to getting better and hopefully one day I'll sound amazing too!😊  
❤️To go along with singing , I really like voice acting too! I haven't done much with it but I try to mimic voices and read stories and make voices for the characters and really get into it. I love voice related anything and really want to have amazing control over it, especially if I can use it make a future friend or partner happy too!  
❤️Cooking🍳is something I love to do as well! I've been making some yummy recipes lately and I really want to get better at that too, I really want to make amazing food for the people I care about to enjoy, like if someone likes my cooking that'd make it so wonderful!😋Then I'll want to cook even more and stuff them full of yummy food!  
❤️Some day I want to have a garden too so I can have really beautiful flowers but also an herb garden would be awesome so I can have fresh ones for using in cooking!  
❤️I really love taking care of my hair, skin (there's no emoji for skin, crazy!), and nails💅(speaking off, I need to trim them!), been learning a lot on that lately, and that goes hand in hand with the cooking so I can make healthy but yummy foods!  
❤️I drink a ton of water each day too (gotta stay hydrated girlies!💦), but also love some pop too, sometimes tea is really nice too or if I'm in the mood then apple cider.  
❤️I also loooove makeup💄so if you're able to teach me anything with that I'd love to know it! It's something I want to master someday!  
❤️I really love fashion and styles and clothes👚and really want to put together a bomb-ass wardrobe. I don't have any one particular style (or the clothes for it, soon though!), I love such a wide variety that I just realized I should start going window shopping!  
❤️I exercise several times a week, I want to be healthy and in good shape and I will work my ass off to get that! (*while also cooking healthy but unhealthy foods*🤫)  
I love dancing and want to learn how to do that at some point too!  
❤️I'm really very much a goofball and love being weird, if making a funny voice or face or strange contorted body movements or anything will make you laugh then I will absolutely do it!  
❤️I like to believe I have high emotional intelligence (even if the regular kind is lacking!❌🧠❌) and will always try to notice moods or changes to make sure that the people around me are doing okay. Anything that I'm able to do to help I will do.  
❤️With that said, communication is *super duper* important to me. If there's something I'm doing that you don't like or if you need help or you're depressed or have something weighing on you, whatever it is, then please tell me. I can't do anything to help or to change and be a better person if you don't let me know what it is. I won't ever judge you for the things you say to me. I will listen and do whatever I can to be a great friend to you.💕  
❤️For the most part I'm an open book, if you are genuinely curious about something about me and want to know it, if you ask I will probably tell you. So long as you are respectful.  
❤️I'm very much a homebody, but I do enjoy going out too. Long walks with someone fun are absolutely amazing!  
❤️Pleaseeeeeeeee for the love of GOD tell me things that interest you!! If you have passion or random knowledge or lore about things, I 👏want👏to👏know👏it👏! Share with me, that makes me happy! And that goes double for my autistic girlies that I know are just brimming with random knowledge!

💕I work from home and do a lot at my computer so I spend a lot of time there, I'll probably be able to reply to any messages fairly quickly unless I get really busy. However I really want to stress that I don't expect that from you, you're not under any obligation to message quickly or often, I totally understand people have different lives and are busy and have other obligations and friends and what have you, so you do you!

💕Here's some random facts about me about things I don't like, just in case you thought I was only positivity and liked everything😁  
😑Monkeys. Like I hate them so much, just annoying little chittering assholes that only cause trouble. Plus they're ugly and I hate how they sound, UGH. (however I have monkeys on some socks and they're cute and I would be perfectly fine with a monkey plushy, just not my first choice!)  
☕Hot chocolate. It's just not my...cup of tea (yeah that's not a pun...), it's too rich for me and I've never liked it no matter how many variations I've tried. If you make it I'll drink it, but it's not my first choice.  
☕Coffee. I'm just not a coffee person. It's too bitter and bland and yes I could put sugar and milk/cream in it but I don't want to have to do that to like something. I can have plain ass tea and that tastes amazing without anything in it. And yes I'll still drink coffee if you make it.  
🍴Chewing noises. I can't stand hearing people eat or chew or make mouth noises. It is the GROSSEST🤮sound in the world to me. Or if I hear you breathing I can't handle that either, it's too much.  
If you're my partner that'd probably be an exception because I'd want to hear the noises your mouth makes, but everyone else NUH UH!

❤️Well that's about it for now, I wrote way more than I ever expected too and for some reason ended on some negatives but it is what it is!😁I tend to love seeing posts that are like this when I look for people to talk to and I figured someone that wants to talk to me might enjoy the same, so why not!😊

❤️If you'd like to talk and develop a wonderful friendship then please send me a message and I'd be happy to hear from you! I hope you are having a lovely day so far and that it keeps getting lovelier!

Meron akong ka situationship nung college for 4 years papangalanin nlang natin siya si Kai. Those times iniisip ko talaga na he's the one kahit pinapaasa niya lang ako sa wala. Pinaparamdam niya kasi sakin na ayaw niya akong mawala and hindi siya sanay at same din ako sa kanya. At nandyan siya sakin emotionally, physically, psychologically. Good and strong yung relationship namin as in super close kami. Bff premium. Sa 4 years marami na din kaming ups and down at isa sa mga gagong ginawa niya meron siyang niligawan habang kami ay MU pero ako si tanga hanggang iyak lang nang patago pero thanks to god nireject siya nang mga girls kaya bumabalik din siya sakin. 😂😂😂 AKIN KA LANG!!! 


Meron kaming barkada pangalan niya si Shing. Btw super close ko talaga si Kai since we're highschool friends same din kay shing. Alam nmn ni shing na may something kami n kai actually alam nang lahat family and friends. LABEL NALANG TALAGA KULANG KASI parang LEGAL NA KAMI!!!! Aba nung nalaman ko na may feelings si shing kay kai at inaaya palagi n shing si kai gumala na hindi ko alam. Si shing nagconfess palihim nang feelings niya kay Kai pero nireject siya n Kai. Pano ko alam? Sympre isang group of friends lang kami and yung chismis ang lumalapit sakin. 


Nung nalaman n shing na nalaman ko na din yung confession niya kay kai. Kinausap niya ako na hindi niya intention na magka feelings kay Kai. Kinausap ko din si Kai kung gusto niya si Shing kasi handa naman ako magparaya kahit masakit pero sinabi niya sakin na wala talaga. Pero iba to! I feel so numb and emotionless kahit sinabi niya na wala. Naniniwala ako sa kanya pero na off na ako sa mga nalaman ko. Parang ok cge! Namanhid ako beh! Kasi alam nmn n shing masisira yung friendship namin at magiging awkward ito pero pinili niya ito sirain. So cinut-off ko sila dalawa and I ghosted him.

after we graduated in college, I had a boyfriend for 2 years and balita ko 2 years na din si Kai at ang kanyang girlfriend. We haven't see and  talked to each other for a long time after sa issue na yun. Fast forward.....⏩ nagbreak kami nang bf ko because of a 3rd party.

Broken ang sissy nyo sa socmed and irl!!!! Tpos biglang may nagmessage ""hi! How are you?"" unknown number. I ask kung sino to and then he replied ""its me, kai"". Kinakamusta niya ako and ganon din ako. Feel ko naka move-on na ako sa kanya kasi wala na akong feelings and walang awkward moments after I ghosted him. Parang bumalik kami sa dati as Close friends pero hindi na MU.

He was my red string always kasi siya lang yung tao na nakaramdam if may problema ako kahit hindi ko sinasabi or malayo kami. Idk meron siyang powers na ganun na if hindi ako okay nararamdaman niya and he always message and calls me if im fine or not. He's always been there for me kaya mahal na mahal ko siya noon.

Nagkamustahan kami and he invited me for a coffee. Sinundo niya ako sa bahay naka motor and we drove to a coffee shop na malapit sa bukid to unwind with my coffee to the nature. We talked things and update regarding our life. Papauwi na kami nung biglang umulan as in binalita na may super typhoon eh nsa province kami. 😭😭😭 basang basa kami and nagstop by sa may labas ng Inn kasi yun lang yung building na malapit silungan. Hanggang umabot kami nga 8pm hangang nahulog yung puno sa daan 😭 so close yung road. 

Nagdecide siya na magcheck-in kami kasi delikado. For me wala naman malisya kasi kinuha niya naman yung room na may two beds. So pumayag na ako mag-overnight. Sympre dahil sa weather at lamig nadala kami sa temptation. Oo beh!!! Sa 4 years namin na MU hanggang leeg lang yun noon pero ngayon!! Shet nagsex na kami!!!!! 

Ramdam ko talaga yung performance niya naman miss na miss na miss niya ako level. At akala ko one night stand lang ang nangyari samin kasi nga broken ako sa ex ko at may girlfriend sya. I know this is wrong!!! Very wrong! KASALANAN TO NG SUPER TYPHOON!!! 

Palagi na niya ako inaaya kasi di siya maka get-over sa ginawa namin. At ako nmn si gaga pumapayag kasi nalulungkot kiffy ko gusto ko din nang may parausan. Hanggang umabot kami ng 4 years!!! Again!!! Upgrade MU to FUBU 😂😂😂

Nagdecide na ako na magstop kasi ayoko na. Iniwasan ko na baka hindi ko nmn kaya at hanap hanapin ko na. At MALI TALAGA! Super mali!!! Hindi siya pumayag kaya I ghosted him again.

Akala ko wala na pero meron talagang tao na KAPAG GUSTO MAY PARAAN talaga na hanapin ako at magkaroon siya nang contact sakin. The effort tho. 

As in patay na patay talaga siya sakin hanggang tini threaten na niya ako na dapat magkita na kami kung Hindi ganern!!! huhu at minumura niya na ako na magpakita na ako sa kanya. Bahala na daw kung malaman ng GF niya tungkol samin basta magkita lang kami. Na off na talaga ako sa kanya!! Parang baliw! 

Sinusumpa niya ako na babalik at babalik din ako sa kanya walang lalaki na magtatagal sakin kundi siya lang.


I reminded him to set boundaries kasi may girlfriend siya at hindi na ako tulad nang dati na patay na patay na anytime pwede siya bumalik sakin. It was just a mistake!! NOT ANYMORE!! Pero dedma siya sa say ko and he said he loves me 😭 


Sinabi ko sakanya na marami siyang chance noon pero sinayang niya lang! 😭 nalungkot ako dahil tagal ako naghintay pero hindi ko na siya mahal. I miss him too sobra.... esp. yung pinagsamahan namin palagi ko siyang iniisip!!!! He is my first love.

Kahit may boyfriend na akong bago huhu I still care for him at iniisip ko pa rin siya. EFFECTIVE yta yung sumpa niya sakin 😭😭😭


Pano to? 😭😭😭 help!!!!

Was playing with my friend, when, at the end of a swiftplay, I recieved a ""Feedback"" pop-up","https://preview.redd.it/iyvf3rea2hse1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2afc21d4f299fc2303f7f870672a8963d25069c4

I stop carrying about this game long time ago, I want to see it improve, I just can't be damned this way. I said to try and give my thoughts to Riot, it will probably end up in the bin, but, since they started pushing these, it means as of recently, something has happened with the game, I am thinking the Players Count took a huge hit. And the Content Creation scene was definitely heard from Riot.

For anyone interested, here are my thought on the game and the improvements I want to see in the game, argue with me how much you want. This is how I feel about the game. Please be civil, though. Bring constructive arguments. I'm mostly playing nowadays in hopes of finding friends and because I invested so much time (and money in this game.), it also has sentimental memories and, as a lonely person, it really helped me find a ton of people. Although, I only talk with one of them nowadays. But enough of me

1. The game is too repetitive, the gameplay loop is not fun at all, the agents start being quite the same, and you rely too much on their abilities. Tejo is just some kind of combination of other agents, instead of being unique in his own way. 

Clove is just Brimstone with something extra. 

Waylay tries to be new, but she is not that much different from the others, failed attempt at making a new agent. I understand coming up with new ideas for agents is hard. But you can do it. You are worth millions of dollars.

2. Maps are boring, they need to add a new map and stop rotating them so often. A map each 1 ACT, maybe with variations of said map, something like The Finals. Maybe there's a map with 3 sites, and the next match it only has 2 sides, because C Site was destroyed. There are endless possibilities.

3. Make cosmetics more fun and less expensive. Remove the Radianite system entirely. It has no place in the game, and it's obviously there just to make you keep buying the battle pass. Improve Battle pass rewards, they are just bad. 

Add emotes, add Agents skins, add 3D sprays, add pets, anything really. 

Stop repeating the same formula of skins, try something new, try something ""quirky"". Add a skin on the Outlaw that brews a coffee after a kill, and you can drink that as a ""flex"". 

Make PlayerCards have more of an impact on the game. 

4. Add more gamemodes, add custom gamemodes like in CS2/CSGO. Let us engage with other players more.

5. Make Ranked count, don't offer just a cheap gunbuddy that is the same each Episode. Give skins for certain ranks. Maybe a knife for the Top 10/Top 50.

6. Stop being lazy, you can't tell me a studio like VALORANT can't add a Replay System in 4 years. Your company is worth millions, it's not impossible, just not financially beneficial for you. But you have to assume some things. VALORANT already suffers from a slop of content, not having many features to make it fun like the other games.

7. Stop punishing us so hard for Non-Competitive gamemodes. Me leaving a Swiftplay shouldn't grant me no more than 5 minutes penalty. And that 5 minutes should come only after you left multiple matches. Not just 3 left matches. ",0,1743622014.0,VALORANT,2,0.5,False

We stayed the first night near the airport so that we could get our bearings, have dinner and be ready to head off in the AM
1st Destination was Manzanillo in the Caribbean South.  We stayed at Manzanillo Caribbean Resort and it was very nice.  Easy walk to the beach and the pool and pool side bar and restaurant were very nice. 👍.  No issues with the drive to Manzanillo but it did take us about 5 hours.

2nd destination was in the hills of Alejuela (Cabanas Zamoray overlooking San Jose sort of between Poas and Bajos Del Toros.  Beautiful spot and very reasonably priced.  No pool here but that was ok as it was only a 2 night stop.  Drove to BJT and it was an adventure that was only 45km but took us almost 2 hours and our 5 speed manual never got above 3rd gear for 95% of the drive.  The waterfalls in BJT certainly made the drive all worth it.

3rd destination was LaFortuna where we stayed at Hotel Campestre Arenal.  Driving down the street to the accomodations had us wondering what we might be in for but we're pleasantly surprised by having room 7 which was a new standalone building at the place.  👍 In LF we went to Bogarin Trail, Mistico Hanging Bridges, Night walk with Richard, Arenal Lava Fields hike & El Choyin Thermal Pools.  Would certainly recommend all of these.  We also walked the downtown and went for meals at a couple of Sodas (La Hormiga & Viquez) and they were outstanding.  Had lunch one day at Cafe y Rest Raul Catano which is on the right hand side between LF and Mistico and the views were beautiful.

4th stop was Monteverde were we spent time at Cabinas Nuestra Casa in Santa Elena.  No pool here but due to the relative elevation it really wasn't necessary.  Very nice homey spot and the home cooked breakfasts were nice.  Excursion wise we did the Monteverde Cloud forest and this was very nice.  No clouds but and enjoyable trip.  Our guide was very good and took a real interest in showing us birds that guideless people would never have even considered let alone seen.  We also went to Salvatura Park to go ziplining which was a lot of fun.  One of the 13 or 14 lines was a kilometer long.  Very cool and worth the time and money.  Also took apart in a Coffee Tour at El Trapiche which was very informative and fun.

5th stop was Manuel Antonio and I have to say that our accomodations here were one of our best (Villa Mar y Sol - Tortuga).  The place is an oasis with everything you could desire!!  We of course went to Manuel Antonio NP which if I am being honest was our biggest disappointment over the course of a month.  We took the first guided tour time slot in the AM and were met with 200-300 people all trying to gain entry.  Once our group got in the park the rest of the tour was slinky where 1 group spotted something, the next group caught up, 1st group left and so on.  Very disappointing.  We spent the rest of the day on the beach which was very nice.  Spent an afternoon at Playa Espadilla in order to have some downtime and to catch the beautiful Pacific sunset.  It did not disappoint.

The decision was then made to head further south for our 6th stop and stay in the vicinity of Uvita.  We settled on Apartamentos Villa del Mar - Tucan and again this was a great choice.  Beautiful pool, spectacular outdoor entertaining area complete with every luxury you would need and a very nice home made path down to a vista above the Pacific where again sunsets were the goal.  Here we went to Nauyaca Waterfall Park which is great opportunity to swim, jump and stand at the base of the lower falls.  Take our advice and walk to the Falls but take the shuttle back to the office!!!  You will thank us!!!  We also spent a day on the beach at Marino Ballena NP.  The machines were down so there was no entry fee the day we went but we did pay for parking ($6).  Beautiful beach but be sure and look at the tide tables so that you visit at low tide like we did.  We also met up with friends and enjoyed a great dinner at  La Parcela on the beach which was both beautiful and entertaining with the white faced monkeys.

Our 7th and final longer stay took us back north on the Pacific to Villas La Paz - Red Villa.  Again, what a superb accomodations that had everything a person could need.  Our own private deck, hammock, personal gas BBQ, bikes, boogie boards, beach chairs, cooler, full kitchen, Jacuzzi tub and all of that and we were able to feel like we were the only ones there.  We were in walking distance to the beautiful Playa Conchal and an easy 5 minute drive to Playa Minas which was a gorgeous white sand beach about 1.5km long and we only had to share it with about 6 other people!!!  Another 5 minutes down the road and we were at Playa Real which took the prize for the best sunsets we have seen.  Truly spectacular.

Final stop was quick little hotel in Liberia for our overnight and early AM flight back home.

Tidbits
Money
We had no issue with credit cards other than at roadside stands where we got our fruit, vegetables and snacks for extended driving days.  Everyone took cards but in some cases Colones gave you the best price
Driving
I would say that 90% of the roads we encountered were paved and we had little issues with potholes.  The unpaved roads were certainly unpaved and the 4x4 was well used but taking your time proves to be the best formula for stress free driving.  Gas stations are full serve and the attendants are great (See People below)
Safety
We of course went with some apprehension after reading probably too many posts.  CR, not unlike most areas, has crime as a direct relationship to opportunity.  Take what we considered to be normal precautions and your trip will be event free
People
I can't say enough good things about the people that we met.  Every single one of them could not have been more friendly or willing to help with anything that we might ask.  They are happy to talk and learn about your home as much as they are willing to help you learn about their lives.
Cell Phones
We both used e-Sims for our phones from Saily with no issues.  The infrastructure in CR is quite good and the number of dead zones was extremely limited at least in the places we went
Groceries
There is no doubt that groceries in CR are more expensive then back at home 🇨🇦 so there is no sense letting it detract from your trip.  Understand it, account for it and then move on.  It's not like things are 10x more expensive but you will notice the increase.
Accomodations
It is not necessary to spend $500/night for great accommodations where you have all that you want and feel safe.  Our budget was $150CDN/night and we had zero issues finding beautiful spots.  We used both Booking and AirBnB
Restaurants
Do not shy away from the Sodas due to their low prices.  It is great way to enjoy real CR dishes in laid back atmospheres and a wonderful way to give back to the families that typically operate them
Timing
We went from mid February to late March and had spectacular weather everywhere.  Just be aware of the rainy seasons and any affect they may have on your plans.
Final Thoughts
CR is a spectacular country with lots to offer everyone.  Take the time to immerse yourself in their culture and country and you will be rewarded.  You will be glad that you did!!!",1,1743621966.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Liam McGregor, Freelance Bum**

Date (Standardized Human Time): October 20, 2136

I continued my journey back to the refugee center, now with a very relaxed alien in my arms.  Fortunately, no one else was around as I went up the steps into the front seating room.

*“Really hating this gravity. If I wanted more cardio, I would have done it somewhere I could stop.”*

Once again the Venlil receptionist was nowhere to be found, but this time I was happy for his refusal to do the job the UN paid him for.  I didn’t want to explain why I had brought back what looked like a corpse.

The stairs and hallways leading to my apartment were empty, and the solitude was perfect for the situation I was in.  There would be no surprises as I opened my door.

Opening my eyes after I had unintentionally summoned Murphy, I found  that he had not been listening at that moment.  My apartment was the same as I had left it, a bit messy and a weird smell that had been there when I moved in. 

*“That simply means it had been lived in.”*  I thought as I set the little thing clinging to my arms on the couch.  *“Thats a good thing, right?”*

I looked back at the alien, now deep asleep on the cushions.  As it then struck me what I was going to do. I had kidnapped an alien, brought it home, and then what?  Let it sleep through its worries and just leave the door open?  I pondered how I would explain this to the facility director as I wandered to the fridge.

Ah, food. The answer to almost any question.  *“It is always better to worry on a full stomach.”*  my pa always said.  I remembered the promise I had given the poor thing and started pulling out the taco stuff.

*“Tortillas, canned beans, tomatoes, these bunt leaves should work as lettuce, firefruit (you’d think that they’d have more imagination about naming things.), some salsa, and. . .”* I stopped myself as I reached for the cheese.  *“She probably can’t have this, and I don’t have much. I only got it because I have a friend in the pantry.”*

*“Can you make tacos without cheese?”*  I felt my nonexistent Mexican ancestors shiver from the thought.  *“Well, when in Rome,”*

I moved the meager ingredients to a table and started to chop the vegetables. The bunt leaves cut easily enough, but the firefruit and tomatoes slid all over the place.  I moved the chopped veggies into bowls and tossed the can of beans into the microwave.  

*“Sans can, of course.  I may be an idiot, but I’m not suicidal”*

I then figured I might as well do things mostly right and warmed the tortillas in a pan over the stove.  As I was moving all of the fixings to the coffee table, I heard the door to my abode open.

Swallowing my heart as I turned around to meet the person who walked in on me about to eat an alien with all the garnishes,  I was incredibly happy to see my brother Tim staring at the fluffy little thing conked out on the couch.

Tim turned to me, no doubt a quizzical expression under that mask 

“Why is there a Sivkit on the couch, and why are you making Mexican?”

I cringed as I remembered every dumb thing I had done all my life before answering truthfully: 

“I, uh, took a walk and this guy jumped at me and told me to eat him. Or her.”

Tim slowly removed his mask as he stared at me with a face I’ve seen far too often recently. 

“So why did you bring them here?” The utter disbelief filled the room, as did the smell of refried beans.  “Are you going to eat him!?”

“NO! She told me to release my needs against her. So I picked her up, gave her a good rub down, and said I would make tacos.”

My brother pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to look serious, but I could see a smile twitching at the edge of his mouth.

“So, a sivkit pounces at you, orders you to use your instincts, and your first reaction is to adopt them.”

“In front of large crowd of Venlil and other things, too.”

The smile cracked even further.

“And now you’re following the instructions of a century-old meme.”

The silence between us lasted a bit too long.

“. . . Yes.”

Tim’s resistance to the grin finally crumbled as you retorted much more jovially  

“If you needed a friend that badly, you could’ve just asked.”

“I did as my base instincts commanded.  Not my fault that we’re wired to be idiots.”

Tim’s shining smile turned a bit more chagrined as he responded:

“Yeah, I paid for 8 years of college and a fancy plaque just to learn that little tidbit.”

Ah, the perfect time to do some brotherly needling.

“Good thing I got an apprenticeship to a chiropractor instead of debt and being allowed to play with people’s brains.”

“True, but I can tell everyone I meet that my brother loves the sound of cracking spines.”

Alert! Fire has been returned! Direct hit!

“You shouldn’t say that here. They’ll take it quite literally.”

A groan drifted from the couch, distracting us from the brotherly love.  The little sivkit, apparently, was starting to stir, no doubt roused by smell of home cooked taco fixin’s. 
I returned to the duties of setting up a meal, as any good host would do, whilst my brother looked at what I had accomplished.

“Yo, did you get the guac? I don’t see it here.”

Guacamole? Where was that holy dip in this humble home?

Tim, no doubt reading my mind, quickly answered his own question.

“Right, I put it in my mini fridge. I’ll go get it.”  My brother returned the mask to his face and went to retrieve the final ingredient from his room.

A sudden rustling turned my attention (and my head) towards the little thing on the couch, watching the sivkit return to the land of the living.

1jpxbn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/s/daFbv0MAfH,I got back with him and I feel so dumb.,"(attaching the link to my previous post where I explained the situation)

A couple of days ago he broke up with me. 
For context, I don't have a lot of friends, and about a month ago I was trying to expand my social circle and me and this guy (let's call him S) were becoming friends. My boyfriend has always been very jealous and possessive, and I knew he's the type who can get physically violent. And he started to be obsessive about me and S, so when me and S went out for coffee one day I was of course scared of telling him. 
He asked if I ever went out with S, and I lied telling him that I never did. 
Then, he went as far as dming S to know the truth and S told him that we met once but after that we only texted to talk about mutual interests.
He flipped and came to my house, showing me the messages and telling me that he never wanted to see me again. I cried, begged him to listen to me, I got in his car and I refused to get off. He took my hand and twisted my fingers, he tried to get the car running while I was with my feet out of it so he was basically dragging me around. He then proceeded to push me off of it and I fell to the ground. I got back home and I couldn't process what had just happened. 
Last night he called me, playing the victim and crying and saying that I'm the one who ruined everything, that he never did anything wrong and that he was desperate because of me. And when this tactic didn't work, he started insulting me. Telling me that I'm a piece of sh*t, a sl*t, mocking me for my eating disorder. Saying that he has all the reasons in the world not to trust me and that I have none because he always told me everything he did. But how can I trust him when I know he has been accused of stalking not once, not even twice, but three times? And somehow, I am the bad guy in this situation. Yes, I should've told him about going out for coffee with S, but I was legit scared of his reaction.
Today, he did the same thing. In person, because he asked to meet me, and then through text. Same script, he played the victim and then he started insulting me again.
He said that he was willing to try again, and I don't know why I accepted. I know I gave myself a death sentence, because now everything will be even worse. But he somehow crashed down all the strength I built up, I stayed strong for two days and then I gave up. I don't know what to do.",2,1743621807.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I’m very new to gardening, I purchased 3 blueberry plants (Sunshine Blue, Bountiful Blue, Bountiful Delight, pics included) and am attempting to grow in pots. Mixed a combo azalea soil and peat moss, with a small amount of holly tone and acidifier (both Espoma brand). I did a lot of reading before getting them, but I have a few questions for any who might have more experience! My back patio gets a lot of sun, when it isn’t cloudy, so I hope it works out!

First, I’ve heard a lot of conflicting advice whether I should remove flowers for this first season to encourage their growth and root establishment? I was unsure if this is advice for smaller baby/starter blueberries, or if it applies to mine as well? I can’t tell how old they are, but I’m estimating 2.5-3.5 years old maybe?

Second, I’ve heard a lot of advice about keeping it acidified, literally heard everything from sulfur to Diet Coke to coffee grounds to store bought acidifier, to urine 🤣 What do you all use/recommend? (Ignore the miracle gro in the background, it’s for other plants)

Also, when I repotted from their 8x8 containers to their current 14x14 pots, I didn’t massage the root ball to loosen it up, cause I didn’t know I had to do that. Is that a mistake?

And side note, everywhere I read says Sunshine Blue is supposed to be more compact, but mine is the tallest of my three, very reaching and “leggy”?

Any general advice, tips, anecdotes, and stories appreciated! (Can’t figure out how to caption pics on Reddit, first pair of pictures is the Sunshine Blue, second pair of pictures are Bountiful Delight, third pair of pictures is Bountiful Blue.

How can I still support my friends without it taking a big toll on me too? I sometimes feel sad to the point of crying for them about certain things and it's draining me completely of energy and emotions when I get back from a rough day myself.

As for the Hat Man,  I had never even heard of him/it. Then to have it happen to me and discover he's like this thing of lore that so many other people have experienced really has rocked my sense of reality. My experience occurred during a state of sleep paralysis which I also had never experienced or even heard of until it happened to me.  I've now seen the Hat Man twice.

**MY STORY:**

This occurred almost five years ago in the wee Sunday morning hours on February 21, 2021. I remember the date because it was my mother's birthday and she was at my house visiting. I had gone to bed around 11:30 PM the night before, about an hour after my wife, daughter and mother went to bed. That was kind of routine bedtime for me and I'm usually quite tired when I go to bed and fall right to sleep. However, on this night for unexplainable reasons I wasn't feeling at all tired. I was just kind of forcing myself to go to bed out of boredom and feeling like it's supposed to be bedtime. There's no reason I can attribute for my energy burst however as I hadn't been drinking caffeine or doing any activities you'd attribute to keeping me awake. So I got into bed next to my wife and recall just kind of tossing around, fixating on my lack of sleepiness and getting agitated I couldn't fall asleep as I kept watching the minutes turn to hours ticking down on my clock which felt like it was taunting me.

Around 2:00 AM I felt like I was *finally* getting tired and close to falling asleep when I started hearing noises downstairs like someone walking around on our hardwood. Usually I would tune it out as ""house noises"" or perhaps my wife downstairs getting a drink, or even the dog shuffling around. But I knew my wife was lying next to me. Then I remembered my mother was staying over and just presumed it was her. So as I laid there, uncharacteristically agitated that I was still awake after 2:00 AM for seemingly no reason and stressing about how it was going to throw off my schedule for the next day, I kept fixating on the noises downstairs and realized I could hear my mother snoring from the guest bedroom next door. So now I was perplexed by these noises. My daughter was only 2yrs old and in a crib. She couldn't be down there and the dog was sleeping at the foot of the bed so everyone was accounted for in my head. I remember feeling a little bit scared and nervous by these sounds now and I knew I had to go investigate. I got up, grabbing the baseball bat I keep by my bedside and as I started to walk out of the room my wife whispers, ""*Oh my God, are you hearing noises downstairs too?*"" I answered, ""*Yes. Stay here. I'm going to check it out...*"" and I preceded as quietly as possible down our stairs which (old house) were notorious creaky, thus making it nearly impossible for anyone to go up or down our stairs stealthily.

As I reached the bottom of the steps the noises stopped. I entered the main living room and threw on all the lights, instantly illuminating the bottom level of the house and hurting my unadjusted eyes in the process. However, it was clear that there was nobody down there. I checked all of the doors and windows and confirmed they were securely closed and locked. I was still confused though because I had definitely been hearing noises, and obviously my wife had heard them too. But after a few minutes of peeking around out the windows outside, and checking my front security cameras to see if anyone had approached the front of the house I felt reassured enough to accept that nobody was down there. I had no choice but to chalk it up to extraordinarily loud ""house noises"" and return to bed.

I proceeded back upstairs, first checking in on my daughter who was soundly sleeping and I could still hear my mother snoring from her room confirming the same. When I crawled back into bed I assured my wife who'd been waiting anxiously that everything was fine and the house was locked up. She asked, ""*Are you sure? I heard footsteps.*"" After some convincing and explaining everything I'd done and places I had checked she seemed reassured enough and I swear she fell back to sleep almost instantly. Now, maybe it was adrenaline, I don't know but I found myself once again lying in bed feeling wide awake and getting more and more agitated. The clock continued taunting me as time ticked on...

I remember looking at the clock and it being  after 3:00 AM. Before I knew it it was 3:45 AM and I was sure I hadn't slept a wink all night yet. I was actually resenting my wife whom I could hear softly breathing as she slept soundly. ""*Why TF can't I sleep!?*"" I wondered. ""*Is this insomnia?*"" It made no sense to me. I'd never had sleep issues before and I didn't do anything the previous day I could attribute to this.

Finally, awhile later, I remember catching myself feeling like I was just about to doze off when I heard the footsteps sound downstairs again. It startled me out of my ""almost asleep"" state as this time they sounded even louder and more defined as footsteps than before. There was no doubt in my mind somebody was walking around downstairs. I felt this wave of fear rush over me like I knew sh!t was about to go down. I remember wondering, ""*Who was this and where were they hiding? How did I miss them while I was down there?*"" I peaked at the clock and it was 5:40 AM, still pitch dark out. I sat up in my bed, making sure my baseball bat was within reach and continued listening to the footsteps below as I could hear them making their way towards the bottom of the stairway.

For context, my bedroom doors are located directly at the top of the stairway and our bed is positioned in the center of the room facing out providing a direct view to the top of the stairs. My daughter's bedroom is directly down the hall to the right and there's a night light in the hall outside her door which ever so slightly illuminates the top of the stairs just enough to kind of see without being distracting. So as I laid there listening to the footsteps downstairs approaching I remember taking notice of my  seemingly useless dog sleeping at the foot of the bed and I recall even thinking, ""*What a useless dog you are not hearing this or reacting*"" because God forbid a doorbell rings on a TV show my dog would be losing his sh!t for an hour, but a potential home invader stomping around downstairs and he's sleeping like a baby.

Anyway, as I laid there feeling my fear and anxiety rising, anticipating having to spring into action at any moment as all the women I love most are sleeping around me I hear the footsteps reach the bottom of the steps then slowly start coming up. As already mentioned, our stairs are obnoxiously creaky and loud so I could hear them creek as the intruder was slowly coming up. I felt my mood shift from fear to anger, kind of like pissed off at whoever dared think they could come into MY home with MY FAMILY and in the moment I was fantasizing about how I was going to destroy them with this bat when they got up here.

I had my fingertips on my bat I was trying to keep discreetly hidden when whoever was there would reach the top off the stairs and be looking straight into my room. As I listened to the creaking stairs as it got closer to the top, I remember first seeing the shadow on the wall of what looked like a man in a wide brimmed hat. Within moments the creature was standing at the top of my stairway. He/It was a tall, shadow figure who appeared to be wearing a long trench coat and the noticeable wide brimmed hat that is staple of *the Hat Man*.

I struggled to make sense of what I was seeing as he/it stood there. It appeared to just be a shadow person. As mentioned, the area out by the stairwell was dark but there was just enough light from the nightlight down the hall that if it were a person I'd still be able to make out *some* details. In this case there were simply none to be seen. This *thing* I was looking at was just a dark void. I remember being both scared and agitated and I don't know if I verbally said it out loud, or just in my head but I remember muttering to myself, ""*Well, Come on. If you're going to do something then do it motherf\*cker*"" and then instantly in that moment the thing/creature/person came flying across the room at me through the air at tremendous speed in the most terrifying moment I can recall of my entire life to that point. I honestly don't know for certain if I was slightly seated upright, or it just felt like it, but I felt as though I was thrown back flat on my back and the creature just hovered above me mere inches from my face breathing menacingly.

It was in this moment I realized I was completely paralyzed. I couldn't move a muscle on my body. Then the creature moved so close to my face that I was encapsulated in it's darkness and now I was not only paralyzed, but momentarily blinded in pitch darkness. I remember trying to scream out to my wife and being unable to mutter a sound. I was terrified and unable to understand this inability to move a muscle or make a sound. I thought fore sure I was dying in this moment. Then... as though I had been released by the very darkness that encapsulated me, the darkness pulled back, once again revealing the shadow figure in all it's horrifying glory. Then in a slow and unnatural movement it's like it rose back up to an upright position and appeared to float backwards away out of my vision as I still laid paralyzed flat on my back. It was only once he was completely out of sight, I suddenly found myself able to take a big gasp of air and realized I could move my body again. I turned over, my heart racing and saw my wife was still sound asleep next to me, as was the dog. I was honestly so confused and scared but I remember just feeling tremendous relief in that moment that I was alive and not paralyzed.

Honestly, as odd as it sounds even now, it was almost as though after the Hat Man was gone I was so fixated on the paralysis I'd just experienced that he was almost an instant after thought. Suddenly I felt dead tired like I was ready fall asleep, but I was scared wondering what had just happened and almost expecting it to happen again at any moment and finish me off. Like I said, I'd never even heard of sleep paralysis. I didn't know this was a thing or understand what had just happened to me. I have a history of heart issues. I've worn a pacemaker since I was 26 years old and I thought for sure this was something to do with my heart and I was likely on the verge of a deadly heart attack or something. What else could it be, right? I remember feeling a profound sadness in that time thinking about how I don't want to die. How I love my daughter and she's only two years old. I'm going to die and this is so unfair!

I recall looking at the clock again and it was 6:15 AM. My wife usually wakes up around this time and would be getting up any moment when my daughter starts fussing from her bed. I must have then fallen asleep because next thing I knew my wife came into the room at 9:45 AM and woke me up to check on me as this was nearly two and 1/2 hours past when I'd usually be awake. The room was full of light and I just remember feeling relieved to be alive and see sunlight.

I went downstairs and had a cup of coffee, visiting with my wife and mother as my daughter played and puttered around us. I was still deathly tired though and wishing I was asleep but it was too late. The day had begun. Still, I couldn't get what happened a few hours ago out of my mind. After my coffee I snuck up to my office on my computer and started researching ""heart attack and stroke symptoms."" This is when my wife snuck up behind me and caught what I was looking at. Of course she, being the loving wife and worrier that she is was concerned to see what I was looking at and asked why I thought I was having a heart attack. I basically explained to her the entire series of last nights events from my perspective. She seemed as freaked out as me but more about the Hat Man which I think at this point I'd already dismissed and compartmentalized as being a nightmare or something. I felt I had more pressing things to worry about like whether or not I was on the verge of a fatal heart attack.

Anyway, apparently my wife is much better at Googling than me because a few minutes later she rushed back in the room and and asked me if *this* is what I saw. Low and behold she put her phone in my face and showed me images of the alleged ""*Hat Man*"" on her phone. This was instantly jarring and terrifying. This mythical, seemingly creature of lore whom I presumed was just *MY* personal nightmare was exactly what I'd seen and before that moment I had no recollection of ever even hearing about such a creature. Then my wife was reading to me that he comes during ""sleep paralysis"" which again I had never heard of before but it instantly made sense that THAT was what I endured. I was both confused and terrified, but also relieved that it most likely wasn't a heart attack.

As mentioned, I am not religious, nor have I ever believed in the super natural. In fact, I was the kid with the balls at the sleep overs who would go into the bathroom and do the Candy Man and Bloody Mary summonsing, because I was always so certain that stuff was bullsh!t. But here I was confronted with article and story after story of people explaining this exact super natural phenomenon with this very same *Hat Man* character that I literally just experienced for myself. I couldn't believe I was staring at images from other people of the nightmare I'd just endured.

Honestly, I was able to instantly accept the sleep paralysis because there was just no doubting that. It made perfect sense. But... I think I kept wanting to find a way to dismiss the Hat Man. It was a dream/nightmare. Anything that made sense. I just flat out didn't want to entertain the idea or have to change my worldview and accept something supernatural like this could be real.

My wife is actually the one who found this r/hatman reddit, and she lurked here for months telling me to come on here and tell my story which I just never did. The only reason I'm doing so now is after four years of what I thought was my one and only episode of sleep paralysis and visit from the Hat Man he came back to me a couple months ago. Literally on the same day and anniversary of his previous visit. Four Years Later. 2/21/2025. WTF, right? This experience was different though, and if I'm being candid - slightly more terrifying. Thankfully no paralysis accompanied this episode. But I'll explain it as briefly as possible...

**THE SECOND ENCOUNTER...**

So I'll be honest. It had been literally four years now since that first encounter.  So long in fact that it had almost become a distant memory, pushed out of sight and mind event that I was mentally dismissing as a one-off. I'd moved on... but I guess *he* hadn't. This is what happened:

I was sleeping when I remember waking up at 4:00 AM. My entire family was sick with the death flu in February. I'd been very sick for a few days at this point so I hadn't been sleeping well and I was keeping a Gatorade on the end table next to my bed. I woke up coughing and took a drink from my Gatorade. After my drink as I laid back down I noticed out the corner of my eye *The Hat Man* figure standing motionless in the bedroom doorway.

I instantly felt a wave of fear and terror wash over me. I turned to my side hoping he didn't notice me notice him but of course he did. I was laying on my side looking at my wife and feeling more fear than anything I'd ever felt since, well, that first night he appeared a few years ago. I was expecting to lose my agility and go paralyzed again at any moment. Out of my peripheral vision I saw him enter the room and I felt his shadowy, negative presence (*I don't know how else to explain it*).

He appeared to be hovering or floating in lieu of walking. There were no footsteps. I saw him enter the room and turn towards my side of the bed as though he was coming straight to me again. I was way too terrified to provoke him like last time though. I closed my eyes but it's like I felt his presence and knew exactly where he was as he approached. I'm not certain but I want to say I could hear almost breathing or something from him. I still struggle to understand how I knew where it was seeing as I refused to actually open my eyes. Maybe I heard him, maybe I just felt his presence but I knew when he was at the foot of my bed by my feet and when he approached me at head level at the side of my bed, even though my back was facing him. When I knew he was right next to me, mere inches from my face I clenched my eyelids shut as tightly as possible. I didn't want to see him out of fear of what may happen. I could feel him leaning or hovering over me, right next to my face. I heard his breathing and felt his dark energy but I refused to open my eyes.

I don't know how long it lasted. Probably at least a full minute or two. I was terrified but he never spoke. Then I felt him stand up and move back away from me. I don't know how to explain it other than say it's like I literally felt the air open up around me releasing me from it's dark embrace. I remember slightly peaking through my eyes and watching him make his way back around my bed and towards the bedroom door. In this moment I closed my eyes again out of fear that he might turn and catch me looking at him. After waiting a minute or two I got the nerve to open my eyes. There was no sign of him and the air in the room felt lighter again. It's like I knew he was gone, and in my exhaustion I fell right back to sleep. I think because I knew who/what he was this time, even though there was no paralysis this encounter felt more scary and menacing, even though he didn't actually touch me or do anything.

After this encounter I didn't even tell my wife for about a week or two because she actually eats this shit up (not in a good way) and gets scared by it. I was afraid she'd start demanding we move thinking we're in a haunted house or something. When I finally told her she was both fascinated and freaked out again. Anyway, it's been about six weeks now. Fortunately he hasn't been back since but needless to say he's back on my mind again after having finally almost faded to a memory. I feel like I'm waiting in fear for the next encounter.

It's kind of embarrassing to admit this but last week on Spring Break my wife went out of town with my daughter to visit her parents and I remember feeling like a scared little kid at home alone. I really was worried the Hat Man was going to come for me while I was home alone. I slept with the light on in my room. Fortunately he didn't return. But I'm seriously a 45 yr old man currently living in fear of this monster/ghost/phantom thing I don't understand now. It's baffling as I read some people tell stories of their Hat Man encounters being friendly, or comforting.... That's certainly not how I'd explain my experience. Sure, mine hasn't harmed me physically (yet), but he scares the Hell out of me. He sure doesn't bring warm and fuzzies. I don't know... I don't even know why I'm spilling this all here now except I felt like I should get the story out. It's been long enough.

* Boost energy and stay refreshed with lemon water, buttermilk, and coconut water.
* Improve digestion and hydration with natural, cooling[ beverages](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/cooling-summer-drinks-to-beat-the-heatwave/).

Switching from hot beverages to refreshing morning drinks can enhance your summer wellness routine. [Cold drinks ](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/5-essential-tips-for-a-healthy-gut-this-summer/)like buttermilk and coconut water not only cool the body but also provide essential nutrients that aid digestion and hydration.

Additionally, green tea offers a metabolism boost without the heaviness of [traditional tea ](https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/revolutionizing-agriculture-the-rise-of-vertical-greenhouses/)or coffee. Hydrating choices like these can improve overall well-being, reduce dependency on caffeine, and help maintain energy levels throughout the day.

# Cool, Hydrating Morning Drinks to Replace Tea and Coffee

Hydration is key during summer, and the right drinks can set the tone for an energized day. Lemon water, packed with[ vitamin C](https://worldmagzine.com/world/childrens-vitamin-d-deficiency-should-they-take-supplements/), strengthens immunity and fights dehydration. Buttermilk, a probiotic-rich beverage, supports digestion and prevents bloating, making it an excellent choice for the morning.

Coconut water, a natural electrolyte booster, replenishes lost minerals and provides instant refreshment. Watermelon juice, with its high water content and essential nutrients, keeps you hydrated while delivering a burst of natural sweetness.

For those who struggle to give up traditional tea, green tea offers a [healthier alternative](https://worldmagzine.com/business/hybrid-formulations-the-future-of-alternative-proteins/). Loaded with antioxidants, it speeds up metabolism, aids detoxification, and keeps the body active without excessive caffeine intake.

A shift toward these natural beverages can significantly improve summer health. By choosing cooling drinks over hot ones, you can support digestion, maintain hydration, and stay energized throughout the day.

Ditching tea and coffee in the [summer doesn](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/street-food-delights-the-risks-you-might-be-overlooking/)’t mean compromising on energy. Hydrating, nutrient-rich drinks offer a refreshing way to start the day while keeping the body cool and nourished.

I was due to return home to New Mexico, flying out of London on 3/16/25. My original flight was canceled and rescheduled for 3/17/25. My Airbnb was willing to accommodate my request to stay one more night for an additional fee. On 3/17/25, the flight from London to Atlanta was delayed several hours. When we finally arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, I was told by Delta Airlines flight attendants (before deboarding the plane) that I needed to go to baggage claim and collect my luggage and then re-check it in after it went through customs. I was assured that if I missed my connecting flight, Delta would put me on the next one and take care of everything. 

I went to baggage claim and searched the screen for my flight number. A Delta employee yelled, “London One!” and yelled several other locations and numbers. I went to the baggage claim carousel number one and waited while I listened to him yell that same thing repeatedly to people who walked toward the screen. I watched a woman go up to him and ask him a question. He responded by yelling the same thing he’d been repeating directly in her face. Later, I saw her in tears, asking a different Delta employee to help her. I waited and watched as everyone else from my flight came and went. I approached a group of Delta employees and asked them if I should keep waiting because everyone else from my flight was gone. They told me that was the correct carousel and that I should keep waiting for my bag. I waited and watched as new people from different flights came, collected their bags from Carousel Number One, and left. I looked at the screen, and it still showed my flight associated with carousel number one. I went to another Delta employee and asked if there was any chance my bag was missing and if it was normal for a carousel to have bags from multiple flights on it. They said yes; carousel number one was for the flight from London and the other flight and that I should keep waiting for my bag. 

After over an hour, I went to the information desk and explained to the woman there that I had been waiting for over an hour and still hadn’t seen my bag. She told me that “an hour is too long to wait for your bag” and pointed at a man in the center of the room. She told me to explain my situation to him. 

I went to him and said that my flight from London was delayed, and I had already missed my connecting flight, but several Delta employees had told me to keep waiting for my bag. A flight attendant also told me that Delta would just put me on the next available flight if I missed my connecting flight. His response to me was to scoff and say, ""Your connecting flight has probably already left without you."" I told him I understood that, reminded him there was also the issue of my missing bag, and asked him what my next step should be. He told me to go upstairs to the customer service desk where people go to check their bags and that I should explain everything to them and they would be able to assist me. 

I went upstairs and waited for the next customer service representative to become available. I greeted her and asked her how her day was going. I explained that I had been in baggage claim for the past hour because I was told to wait for my bag. My suitcase never showed up so I would like information about who I can speak to regarding missing luggage. Also, I missed my connecting flight to Albuquerque and would like to get set up on the next flight. This woman was the worst part of my Delta experience. I was so taken aback by her defensive response and lack of empathy that I was at a loss for words. She asked me why I waited for my bag for so long. I explained that I was directed to do so by the Delta employees working in the baggage claim area and the flight attendant on my flight from London. She said that no one from Delta works in baggage claim and that I should have known better than to wait for so long, and if I hadn’t been doing ""whatever"" I was doing down there, then I wouldn’t have missed my connection. I told her I had been told to collect my suitcase and check it in again because of customs. I told her it was my first international flight, and I was following instructions given to me by people with Delta Logos on their uniforms. She said, “Well, there's no one dressed like me down there, so I don’t know what to tell you.” She then explained that I would have only needed to collect my suitcase if I were staying in Atlanta. She said that because I had a connecting flight to Albuquerque, my suitcase was already on the flight I missed while waiting for it to show up downstairs. She told me there were no more flights to Albuquerque and that there was nothing that she could do. I asked her what I should do, and her response was, “I don’t know why you waited down there for so long. You already missed your flight. It left without you.” I said, “I understand that my flight has already left without me, and it’s too late to take that flight because it’s already gone. Please tell me what the next step is.” She repeated that there was nothing that she could do. She was so cold, and her tone was so condescending and rude. I couldn’t believe she was shrugging me off when all I’d done was follow instructions. I asked her if there was anyone else I could speak to. She told me to call customer service. I looked at the “Customer Service” sign above her head and asked her if there was anyone at the airport I could speak to. She said no. She said, “No one here can do anything for you. You shouldn’t have missed your flight”. She handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-800 number and told me to call the number. 

I felt so defeated walking away from that conversation. I had to wipe tears from my cheeks and steady my breath, and I’m not someone who gets emotional very easily. I work in a high-stress job where I am expected to maintain a calm and collected demeanor regardless of how people speak to me. I find that it’s not difficult to maintain my composure when people become verbally hostile. But, in this case, I felt mistreated by a company that I paid a lot of money to ensure my safe travel to and from another country. I called the 1-800 number she gave me and was connected to an automated voice telling me that the wait time was over an hour and that I could set it up to call me back and I wouldn’t lose my place in line. I did that and then wandered around the airport looking for ideas of something I could do to improve my situation while I waited for a call back. It should be noted that Delta customer service never returned my phone call. 

I saw a kind-looking woman at Spirit Air, and I walked up to her and gave her a brief description of my situation. I told her that I realized she didn’t work at Delta, but I thought that because she worked at the airport, she might have a suggestion about where I should go next. I asked what she would do if she were me. She was kind and suggested I go to the baggage claim office downstairs, not the carousels but the office where there will be people from different airlines sitting behind desks. I thanked her and went back downstairs. 

I found the office, and inside was a woman sitting behind a Canada Air desk and a woman sitting behind a Delta desk. I greeted them and said that I wanted to start by saying I don’t think anything I’m about to say is anyone’s fault. I am only hoping that they could provide some insight or guidance about what I should be doing to remedy the situation I find myself in. They looked at me very suspiciously (rightfully because I realize that’s an odd way to start a conversation with someone). I explained everything that had happened so far, and they both listened. They didn’t tell me it was my fault or get defensive like the woman in customer service. They didn’t yell at me or tell me to wait like the Delta employees working near the baggage claim. They were both kind and empathetic. They apologized that they weren’t able to help me with much, but they did look up my luggage information and explained that, although they didn’t have it and couldn’t tell me exactly where it was, they could tell me that it definitely wasn’t on it’s way to Albuquerque already. They said that the woman upstairs was wrong about that because the flight to Albuquerque took off only five minutes after my plane landed. They said there was no way it could have gone through customs and transferred to the ABQ flight in 5 minutes. They also explained to me that there was no way I could have made that flight either (even if I didn’t wait for my bag) because by the time I deboarded the plane from London to ATL, the plane from ATL to ABQ was already pushing off. They told me I should go back upstairs and ask for a “Red Coat” because the woman I spoke to was way out of line. I appreciated them validating my experience and doing everything they could in their capacity to help me get closer to finding a way home. I thanked them both and went back upstairs.

I noticed the woman that I initially spoke to was still there, but she seemed to be packing up her belongings and getting ready to end her shift. 

I went up to the man sitting at the single seated information desk in front of customer service and told him I was advised to ask for a “Red Coat”. He called out someone’s name, and a man in a red coat came out from behind a section of the customer service area. He asked me what he could do for me. I explained the CliffsNotes version of my experience thus far and told him that, in summation, I would really just like to go home and, if there is any way I could also have my suitcase that, at this point, would just be a bonus. He told me that there were no more flights to Albuquerque that night, but he walked with me to a new customer service woman and stood with me while she explained that she could get me on the 8 am flight the following day. He told her to set me up with a room voucher and a voucher for a meal, and then he assured me that my bag was most likely caught up in customs and that I should ask about it in the morning. He said it would probably end up on the flight with me in the morning. I thanked him, and he left. 

The customer service woman he left me with gave me the vouchers and told me where to get to a bus that would transport me to hotel shuttles and that I needed to make sure I got on the correct shuttle to take me to the right hotel. She gave me an idea of how the vouchers worked and told me that although she couldn’t give me a flight confirmation number, she could assure me that there would be one for me tomorrow morning when I arrived at the airport. I thanked her and went to the bus, where I stood in line and had to take the next one as the one currently parked there was at full capacity. 

I got on the next bus and rode to the area where the hotel shuttles picked up passengers. I waited for about 15 minutes and saw the shuttle I needed for the hotel Delta’s customer service rep had picked for me. People were shoving and pushing their way onto the shuttle, and when it was over capacity, he advised people to get in and stand in the aisle. They were crammed in like a can of sardines standing up against each other from the back to the step at the front door. He said if I didn’t get on, I’d have to wait for at least another 30 or 45 minutes and that the hotel was only 6 minutes away. I said no thank you, that it wasn’t safe, and he drove off. I walked across the street and took a cab to the hotel. Another expense, but it's worth it for safety. 

When I arrived at the hotel, I found a long line of people waiting to be given room keys. Only one person was working at the front desk, and everyone was upset, asking why Delta would send everyone to the same hotel (I didn't recognize any of these people from my original flight). I waited in line for close to an hour before receiving a key to my room. The room was freezing with the AC blasting, and the off button wasn’t functioning, so I just unplugged it from the wall. I turned on the TV and found that it was not working either. I sat down on the bed and let it all sink in. The fact that I didn’t have my suitcase meant that I didn’t have pajamas, a change of clothes for the morning, my prescription medications, my toothbrush, or my medical back brace. It was 10:30 at night when I checked into the hotel room. I had been at the ATL airport for approximately five hours. I gave myself 5 hours to sleep so I could be back at the ATL Airport with time to make sure I had a flight, see if they could find my bag, and hopefully work out any issues with either of those things as well as making it through security in time to be on the 856AM flight. 

In the morning when I got to the airport, I went to customer service who told me that my suitcase was most likely already on the plane and if I got to Albuquerque and found that it wasn’t I could take it up with them. At this point, I had mentally written off my luggage as lost, and I just wanted to get home. I asked her if I should print a boarding pass, and she said no because I could use the one from yesterday. 

I stood in the security checkpoint line, and when I got to the front, I scanned my old ATL to ABQ boarding pass. They told me that it wouldn’t work and to pull up the one on my phone. I have the Delta App, and I had already checked in, but for some reason, it was showing an error message that said that my confirmation was unavailable and to check back later. I signed in to the airport WiFi, and the internet was working fine on my phone. I don’t know why the app would not show my boarding pass. The man at TSA security told me that I should have taken a screenshot when I had the chance, and then this wouldn’t be a problem. I looked up at him, and he must have seen something on my face that made him change his tone. He told me to follow him to another computer. He asked me to show him my passport, and he typed in some information and then told me I could go through to the next checkpoint. I appreciated his kindness. 

At the next checkpoint, a man yelled at everyone to take their shoes off and leave their laptops in their backpacks. Everyone seemed to be complying quickly, and the yelling seemed unnecessary. I unzipped my backpack. He made eye contact and said, “I just told you not to take your laptop out of your bag”. I nodded, pulled a water bottle out of my bag, and put it in the trash bin. He told me I was not allowed to bring water bottles that were full like that through the checkpoint. I nodded a little confused as he said it after I’d already thrown it away. I was so tired and didn’t want to be yelled at anymore. 

I was so hungry, and I’d made it through all the security checkpoints with time to spare so I added one of the vouchers to my Starbucks app while I walked toward Starbucks to get breakfast. When I tried to add the second voucher, it gave me an error message and told me that that voucher was no longer available. $10 isn’t enough to get breakfast at Starbucks, so I did need both vouchers but I didn’t have it in me to seek out any more Delta customer service reps, so I figured I’d just get a coffee and ask the flight attendant for some pretzels once I got on the plane. When I got to the Starbucks, they informed me they would not be open to the public that day for training purposes. So, with one voucher tied up in the Starbucks app and the other malfunctioning, I could not purchase a meal and hadn’t eaten anything since the previous morning. 

I got on the plane with no issues, landed in Albuquerque and went to baggage claim. My suitcase, as it turned out, was on the flight with me and didn’t fly to Albuquerque the night before as one Delta employee had insisted. 

I was due to be back at work on 3/16/25 and missed two days of work because of this ordeal. I wrote to Delta Complaints Department and asked them to also please look up the report a flight attendant took on my previous flight from LAX to London: As we were moving to take off, the passenger sitting next to me was told he had to wait to use the bathroom, so he threw his arms in the air like a toddler, hitting me in the face, which causede me to have a noticeable bruise across my cheek for most of my vacation. He single-handedly caused a delay in the flight, claimed it was a seizure, and then his sister practically begged me to trade my aisle seat for their mother’s window seat in the next row back so the three of them could sit together, claiming she was a nurse who could monitor him. He spent most of the flight getting up and walking around as he pleased and showed no signs of being ill or incapacitated. I felt pressured to trade with his mother, so I spent the whole flight pressed against the window next to two very large men. 

I always choose aisle seats because I don’t like to feel trapped, and I was uncomfortable asking two strangers to get up to let me out halfway through the 9-hour flight so I could use the bathroom. I made no complaints about that flight to Delta and was only bringing it up because these are my only experiences flying with Delta, and I feel like I must be an exception to the rule because no one would choose to fly Delta if this were the norm. 

Their response was a payment of  $655.34 that I could accept if I wanted to, with the only other option being to ignore the offer. It says on their website that my case is closed. I haven't accepted the money yet. I have a few days before they say it will be voided. 

Do you think I should accept it? I feel like it's not enough, considering everything.",0,1743620480.0,delta,6,0.25,False

There have been many things my entire life that I've never been able to talk about or have an outlet to talk or get opinions besides therapy. 
Also, Charlotte I'm a big fan of your videos. They're always entertaining with your commentary and love your little shark. 

I'm 19(F) that was primarily raised on the West coast with my mom, B(46F) and my sisters, H(26F) and A(21F). I've had a rocky/barely existing relationship with all 3 of them for a multitude of reasons. Everyone says being the oldest or middle child is the hardest, but some in some families, it's very different. 

For some things to make sense about our relationship, I have to get this out of the way. I'm a bit autistic with ADHD, and have suffered from depression and anxiety since I was 12. So I've always been the odd one out in the household. 

My mom and I have had a rocky relationship. I did many things that a child shouldn't do but it was always held against me even if I'd made it right. I've always been yelled at for forgetting to do something (ADHD), or struggling with my self care (showering, hair, cleaning my room, because of depression and anxiety). My mother never tried to understand this and it always made things hard because it was always the same conversation over and over again. When I had first struggled with depression at age 12, I had thoughts of taking my own life and even attempted, that was the only time my mother showed care for that situation. She got me in counseling and on medication. I would have times of depression and anxiety being very hard and painful, and others of me feeling perfectly fine. Those times of things being hard, I'd fall into thoughts of self harm, and over time my mom got irritated with it. She acted like I had no reason for it when I struggled with the reason, she's threatened putting me into a mental hospital or military school, so I had stopped talking about it and shut my emotions off from her. 

Me and my oldest sister H(26F) haven't really ever been close due to our age gap. She was in high school when I was in elementary. Me and her never had a bad relationship, we just never were able to build one up until now. She lives on the West coast with her fiance and her 2 kids, we call and text occasionally but we're both usually too busy to talk. We've always bonded over anything about dogs and horses which always made me happy. She's always been my favorite family member. 

Me and my other sister A(21F) on the otherhand, have never really gotten along.  She has one kid of her own and another on the way. We have always fought and argued with each other over just about anything. Food, toys, tv, who got to ride in the front seat, who for to spend time with mom, anything. It always ended in a screaming match with me crying after being the one in trouble and not her. During many of those arguments, there had been times where she would hit me or throw something at me, even if I had proof on my body of where this happened, she never got in trouble and it was always me. It never was better over the years as we got older. At one point I had left to to to Job Corps and a fight broke out between me and her with it ending in her telling me that I weaponize my depression and never get in trouble by threatening to take my life. As he continued to tell me that if I wanted to do it so bad that I should go ahead and do it. That initially broke any relationship that I could've wanted with her. 

There was a situation in Job Corps where they had sent me on ""medical leave"" for student rumors. Instead of going back, I decided to get a job with my mom and my sisters A(26F) fiance. It went well for awhile and there wasn't any problems for me and I genuinely enjoyed it. 

October of 2024 I met my current partner C(21M). We get along really well and my animals love him and his love me. I get along with his mom and his step dad really well, and him and my dad get along really well too. But my mom and A don't like him and I've never understood why. They've accused him of hitting on A, calling him annoying and a know-it-all, and claiming there's a ""bad vibe"" from him. He's not mean or abusive, he actually takes care of me and would drive me to work at my old job. He would surprise me with lunch and coffee at work and would take my dog out with him for the day on his days off. I always loved it and still do. Me and my mom have fought about him, because she doesn't like him. 

In December of 2024 me and my partner found out I was pregnant, I'm currently 19 weeks pregnant now and extremely happy. H, my oldest sister was really supportive of me and gave me advice when I told her. My mom and A had both told me to get an abortion. A had told me my baby wouldn't have a good life with me as the mother and that it's my fault I was pregnant. Keep in mind I was on birth control, not trying to get pregnant. I've resented them both for this. When we told C's parents they were supportive, they didn't want us to abort the baby, or adopt out. They had offered to adopt our baby if we decided to go that route because they wanted baby to stay with the family. It's their first grandchild, this would be my mother's 4th.

I eventually moved in with C and his parents, with my dog Tucker who's German Shepherd and Rottweiler, and my cat Cleo who's a Polydactyl Tortoiseshell. Their pets, Alucard a Maine Coon mix, Atlas an ex-Feral cat, and Sutton a Frenchie, all get along well. My mother has tried many times to get me to move back home any way she can. Saying they all miss me, they want to do baby stuff with me, and saying that I'm always welcome if something happens with me and C thinking he might hurt me or the baby. And I recently quit my job because of my mom, for the fact that we would argue about PERSONAL HOME LIFE at work in front of co-workers. I couldn't handle that environment anymore and have already had job interviews. 

My life away from my family has been happier than it's ever been for me. Aside from arguing with my mom recently trying to explain why I've distanced myself and her not understanding any of it. I like my life how it is, I love my partner, our relationship, and I'm excited for our baby. My family makes me feel guilty for this choice.. Is it really such a bad thing that I want to be happy even if they don't like my choice? Is it wrong to not want them involved after everything? 

I'm sorry the post is kind of all over the place.. I was trying to sum certain things up the best I can and explain the best I can with each relationship. Thank you to whoever reads this post. ",2,1743620463.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

The faded sign outside reads: “Kernie’s Place.” The metal is rusted, the paint peeling in places, but the neon lights still buzz faintly in the evening air, casting a faint glow that never seems to turn off, even in the dead of night.

The door creaks open on its own, a steady, rhythmic sound that doesn’t match the emptiness inside. Stepping in, the smell of grease and stale coffee hangs heavy in the air, but there's an odd sweetness to it, like it hasn’t been touched in years, and yet, it’s strangely… fresh.

The booth cushions are cracked, their red vinyl faded to a dull orange. The tables are set, the silverware neatly arranged, as though someone is expecting company, but no one comes. There’s a faint hum in the background, almost as though the diner is waiting for something—or someone.

Behind the counter, a man stands, his face unreadable. His name is Kernie, though you would never have known if it weren’t for the old nametag pinned to his chest. His hands move with practiced ease, wiping down the counter in slow, deliberate circles, his eyes never leaving the surface. He doesn’t greet you. He doesn’t acknowledge you.

You sit down.

The menu is worn, the edges curling from years of use. You scan it, but the words seem out of place—vague, incomplete. The prices, too, seem strange, like they’ve been scribbled out and rewritten so many times that they’re becoming a blur.

Still, you order. A cup of coffee. A sandwich. He doesn’t ask for clarification, just nods once, his face never changing.

When the food arrives, it’s exactly what you’d expect—simple, unremarkable. Yet, as you take a bite, a strange sensation washes over you. The food is stale, but it’s not unpleasant. It tastes… too familiar. As if it’s been here far too long, and yet somehow, it still remains, waiting.

Kernie doesn’t speak, but his eyes—those dark, endless eyes—seem to follow you wherever you go. And the longer you sit, the more you notice it: the soft, almost imperceptible ticking sound, like a clock ticking too slowly. Or perhaps it’s the sound of something waiting.

The diner feels like it’s stuck in time.

No one has been in Kernie’s Place for years, and yet the food is always hot. The lights always on. The sound of the clock never stops.

If you sit long enough, you might begin to wonder: how long has Kernie been here? How long has it been since someone walked in, and will anyone walk out?",4,1743620102.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

Dec 28, deer strike in my car. Not horrible, but this car is my baby. I looked for months to find the exact one I wanted at something approaching a reasonable price. It's nothing spectacular, an '05 Magnum R / T (had to space so reddit didn't link?) in Inferno Red, but it's mine and something I wanted since they came out. Minor damage - bent fender, busted headlight, small wrinkle in the door where the doe bounced off before landing in the ditch. Initial estimate $1700. No worries, quick fix, wait for the body shop to get the parts and time. Still drivable, but only during daylight hours since I don't want to risk a ticket for the headlight being out. It's Michigan, but still...

Feb 22, I put the dogs away as normal when I leave - smallest 5 in their pen and the big baby in his crate as he's capable of getting out of the pen. (the smaller ones are mini-ish Dachshunds, the big baby is a standard Dachshund) They've all been penned together for at least 3 years. As I'm leaving for grocery shopping and a much-needed haircut, I get the text notification that they've totaled my beloved car for a deer strike. Gone for about 3 hours, come home to blood in the multi-dog pen and one of the dogs semi-responsive (in shock, actually, although I didn't realize at the time). Immediate departure for the best emergency vet in the state 2 hours away. An overnight ICU stay, lots of emotion and money later, and she didn't come home. Picked her up at the vet on the 24th to bring her home for the others to say goodbye, and then transport to the crematory. We did it this way to allow the other dogs to realize she was gone, particularly the oldest who was closest to her. Pic of the recently departed for tax. (The pillow was her favorite ""bed"", and I think the crematory included it so she has it for always. close to a dozen beds in this house, and she always chose that pillow)

Feb 26, my FIL calls to let me know MIL is in the hospital, transported by ambulance due to difficulty breathing. (COPD, CHF, lung capacity at a max of 34% before they left here) They were in Florida to escape the Michigan cold, for the first time ever. This isn't the first time she's been hospitalized for this, more of an every 2 or 3 year adventure. Told Dad we'd start working on a visitation schedule so he would have support. That night, about 11 pm, he called. Need to get there asap, she isn't going to make it. Got husband and SIL on the plane the next day, got things arranged so I could leave also (dog & house sitter, arrange with work) and flew down on Saturday. I was able to see her briefly on Sunday, when she appeared to recognize me. During later visits, she didn't recognize or respond to anyone, including my SIL who's always been able to get a response. Wednesday, March 5, the decision to end life support was made and she was gone. She truly is in a better place, but it's agonizing. I have the world's best in-laws. dnr/dni is a good thing. She was on life support long after what made her 'Mom' was gone. My husband was there at the end. He has nightmares about watching her body die.

Last week, I finally got payment for my car. Yes, almost 3 months after the initial deer strike, following weeks of back and forth with the insurance company because I am keeping my car - it took me months to find exactly what I wanted and I'm not interested in doing that again. And since the ins co took so long to authorize me to keep the car, and to make payment, the car is now at the back of the line again at the body shop.

This past weekend, my bestie and her family were hit with the northern Michigan ice storm. No power since Saturday night, and not expected for weeks in the rural area where they live. My husband hauled propane and gasoline up for the generators yesterday (about 2 hours each way and he made 2 trips) and will likely do so again. More love from Mother Nature expected today and tomorrow. Bestie's dad is in poor shape also.

Monday, March 31, my DIL's mother passed, as did my mother's childhood best friend. Neither unexpected, but no less painful. And my mother isn't going to be able to travel to the funeral due to her own health issues. 

My mom - She's deteriorating much more rapidly than I realized - Sis says ""She plays a good game on the phone"". Her cognitive ability is declining, but it's not dementia. She's oriented, knows who she is, when & where she was born, when & where she is, what year it is, who the president is, all the normal cognitive questions are answered appropriately. The newish stuff - she can't make sense of anything with buttons - phone, remote, microwave, oven (thank goodness it's electric and not gas!), consistently cannot read anything handed to her (holding a restaurant menu upside down ""I can't read Spanish!""), clothes and shoes are on backwards/wrong feet/inside out. Her eyes have been checked and pronounced okay with reading glasses. I inherited my love of reading from her - she's always been a voracious reader, fond of word puzzles, that sort of thing. She's not been allowed to drive for a few years now so that's not a concern anymore. Lifelong chain smoker, refuses to quit. Even after her broken hip and stint in rehab when she wasn't allowed to smoke (and for the weeks after she came home while I was there - 7 total). Non-compliant with her meds, lies about taking them and her insulin. Does not, and will not, eat healthily. We've tried meal prep, meal services, cooking while there. She eats bread and peanut butter and crackers. And fast food. Sis had to take Door Dash off her phone (prior to her hip) because that's all she did. $100+/day Door Dash, and nothing healthy or even close to it. She lives alone, refuses to move. Refuses any outside help. Also, she's not a nice person. Prejudicial, racist, and just plain mean from time to time. (Sis says ""sell your house, we'll sell ours, and get something big enough for all of us"". Mom was fine until she saw prices. She's convinced she can still get a big house for $200K. In Ft Worth, TX.) We have cameras in the common areas of her house, but not the bedrooms or bathroom. I was overruled. Someone is at the house with her daily, but not all day. She sits in her recliner or on the back patio, smoking and eating bread and crackers and drinking coffee and diet Mt Dew and overfeeding her dogs, when she's alone. I feel like a heel because 90% of this falls on my youngest sister. I am states away, and my mother's other daughter isn't much help unless it benefits her. (Sis, in all of my rambling, is the good one.) She has a doc appt here shortly (like, in 45 minutes) and I've asked my sister to have them check for a UTI since I hear those present differently in older people and can cause some whacky symptoms. Fingers crossed...

Any of this individually, or spaced out a little, I could handle better. Shit's just piling up. :( Thanks for following along, and letting me vent.",6,1743620028.0,FuckeryUniveristy,4,1.0,False
1jpwkrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1jpwkrt/feeling_disheartened_after_trying_church/,Feeling Disheartened After Trying Church Counseling—Just Wanted a Friend,"I want to start by saying that I’m a Christian, and church is really important to me, so I’d appreciate it if my beliefs aren’t bashed.

I’m 29F, and my husband and I are living separately because of his adultery and other serious issues. I moved across the country to his state before we got married, so I don’t really know anyone here. When our marriage started to fall apart, I knew I had to get out of my introverted comfort zone and find a community for myself and my 3-year-old daughter. After researching, I found a church that felt like home on the first visit, which hadn’t happened with other churches before. It’s a medium-sized church, and I’ve been there for about seven months now—going to Bible studies, attending events, and really putting myself out there.

One day, the leader of my small group (who’s around my age) introduced herself, and we ended up getting coffee together. It felt like a breakthrough in forming a friendship, and I shared a bit about my life, including my broken marriage. Up until then, I hadn’t told anyone because I wanted to protect my husband’s image and felt pressure to keep up appearances. After hearing my story, my new friend suggested I see the church’s biblical counseling center, saying it might help to have an older woman to talk to. I agreed that it could be helpful, but what I really wanted was just a friend who would listen and care.

Over the months, I confided in her a few more times when new things came up with my husband. Each time, she would immediately tell me to fill out the counseling form instead of just being there as a friend. It left me feeling kind of rejected, but I finally gave in and filled out the form because I felt so desperate for someone to talk to.

The counseling center set me up with an “initial interview,” and honestly, it was exactly what I was hoping to avoid. The whole thing felt cold and procedural, not warm or relational like I expected from a biblical counseling ministry. The interviewer even asked me if I was planning to divorce and, when I said I couldn’t right now, basically implied I didn’t need counseling if I had it “figured out.” She also cut me off when I mentioned another church I’d visited. At the end, she said counseling wasn’t just an hour of talking but would include “homework” and training to go to Scripture. That really hurt because I already seek God’s guidance and feel close to Him, but I just wanted a friend to lean on.

I don’t think I want to continue with the counseling, but I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or come off as ungrateful because I do think the ministry is valuable—it just doesn’t feel right for me. I love this church and want to keep building relationships there. How do I gently back out of the counseling without offending anyone? I’d really appreciate some kind advice.",3,1743620021.0,Christianity,4,1.0,False

If a survivor attempts to place a boon on Hex: Entrapment, the totem will break, the survivor will scream, and will receive the **Exposed** Status effect for 15s/20s/25s.

**Interrogation**

Whenever you hook a survivor, you can see the current actions of other survivors for 3s/5s/10s. (If they are healing, repairing gens, etc. This looks like you are playing survivor yourself.) You also see the aura of the generator with the most progress.

**Scourge Hook: Cruel and Unusual**

The 4 hooks in the basement become scourge hooks.

If a survivor attempts to unhook a survivor on a scourge hook for the first time, they are met with a difficult skill check. If they fail this skill check, the survivor on the hook will lose hook progress as if they attempted to get off the hook themselves.

**Survivor - John Crafs.**

*Survivor Perks* \-

**Snitches Get Stitches** \- When another survivor loses a health state, gain 1 token for a max of 3 tokens.

If a killer attempts to read a survivor's aura, consume one token and block the aura reading of all survivors for 3s/5s/9s.

**Onto Plan B-** If you're the last remaining survivor, you can see the aura of the hatch.

**Have your back! -** This perk activates at the start of the trial. If you get close to a killer holding a survivor, you may press E to enter a hard skill check. If you succeed, the killer is stunned and drops the survivor.

**Killer Lore -**

It was the worst night of his life, another patrol in Roseville ended with a nightmare call Officer Wilson wouldn't have dared dream to answer. Another break-in, another murder by the Ghost Face killer, another family slaughtered but this time, it was his family.

How they couldn't find this guy after that night beat at his mind, they must have not cared all that much. The town was scared, but the trust in the police had faded mainly his trust. That mask from the videos they've seen at the station, the memories mocked him. Fuck the books, he was going to find this guy himself.

He took to the streets every day, stalked each night and his only rest were energy drinks and coffee to keep him awake. They sent him on mental health leave to grieve, but this was all the grieving he could do. Something would come up, the Ghostface Killer would see justice. The time came when he saw a shadow in the bushes behind the home of a family of four, peering through the windows and watching their daughter change.

Wilson kept his feet low, the grip of the nightstick in his hand tightened with each step and his teeth ground with each passing thought of his own wife and kids slaughtered. Each bash to the fucker's head painted the windows red and the shocked screams inside were muffled by the satisfying, gurgling cries of the bastard begging for his life. The young, high-school-aged killer, donning black and with a love letter in his pocket. His teeth mixed with his brain matter and skull fragments littered the backyard, and he could only smirk at his body as the father begged him to leave.

The Roseville courts wanted to put him away for thirty years for killing love stuck Tommy Grons, watching his crush through the windows of her home. Wrong guy, but still filth. Filth that they never bothered to fix, to punish and they wanted to lock HIM away. The whole town was tainted with filth.

Wilson awaited his final sentencing in his cell. Despite it being lights out, he stared into the darkness with his rage boiling beside him, his only true ally. He lit a cigarette with a match, and in the dim, orange light, a faint, black fog brushed by. It snuck around his legs, then embraced him, covering his face until all he saw was the swirling, black void. The cold concrete ground had been replaced with grass and soil, there was his old uniform and the nightstick he had used that night.

The law had failed him, yet he smiled, for it couldn't fail him now. He was the law here.

**Survivor Lore -**

John ""Houdini"" Crafs never had the easiest life. Poverty and orphanhood had him running around the country as a con man, until one scam went wrong. It would've been his greatest scam yet, but instead it gave him fifteen years. Prison revealed another hidden talent he had, the ability to get out. His fifteen turned to twenty and then twenty-five, another year with each successful escape. The other prisoners began to refer to him as ""Houdini"".

Tired of writing, but long story short, he tried to escape prison again and that's when the entity takes him.

Not a big fan of AiO's - mostly because the reason I had to make a new PC was due to a AiO leak :/... I got really lucky with being able to casually walk in and get parts.

Can someone please recommend the top 3 choices for the 9950x3d & 9800x3d?

**Current New Build is:**  
**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 9950x3D  
**GPU:** MSI SHADOW 3X OC GeForce RTX 5080 16GB  
**Motherboard:** Asus ROG STRIX B850-F GAMING WIFI ATX AM5  
**RAM:** G.Skill DDR5 Trident Z5 Neo RGB 64GB (2 x 32GB) 6000MHz CL30 1.40V  
**Power Supply:** Asus ROG STRIX 1200P Gaming 1200 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply

The PC Case is the Asus ProArt PA602 Wood Edition ATX Mid Tower Case.

So far from research I'm seeing alot of recommendations for:  
(1) → Noctua NH-D15 G2 91.58 CFM CPU Cooler  
(2) → be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 5 air CPU Cooler  
(3) → Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE CPU Cooler  
(4) → Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO CPU Cooler

I'm kinda going for a Darker Wood/Metal/Glass look with coffee like contrast which is why I was pivoting towards the Noctua. I don't mind something stainless steel or even copper color/gold if possible but temperature/thermals are big.

Workload is mostly Architecture & Engineering + Renders with 4k Gaming in mind.

Could you guys please help me out with the CPU - Air Cooler recommendations?",2,1743619835.0,buildapc,19,0.75,False

1jpwg5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jpwg5w/beans/,[Beans],"Hi all.

First post here.

So I have been using Mokarabia Superbar beans for around 3/4 years now as after trying so many different types me and my wife finally found the espresso beans we loved and never got bored off.

Suddenly they don’t sell them no more, anywhere.

This is really disappointing as we haven’t been able to have a coffee we supper like for the last month and have tried various beans in hope to find a match.

Does anyone know what happened to them and if so what a good match of beans we can get?

Those particular beans were super strong caffeine wise but most importantly had a taste we fell in love with and when we poured a shot it was thick with a nice cream on top.",1,1743619706.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1jpwe9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingCeres/comments/1jpwe9r/preparing_for_launch/,Preparing For Launch,"Greetings Pilgrims;  
  
First, I have ended the beta ahead of this build. The beta players have been amazing, but I want to keep them out of this last build so they have some surprises for the launch. A huge thank you to everyone for their help with the game; it would not be nearly as bug-free and smooth without your feedback.  
  
On a sadder note, I have decided to pull the translations. I am OK with having machine translations for the beta and the demo. But I am not OK with launching the game with terrible machine translations. I had hoped to get community help to polish translations, but it didn't happen. For that reason, I am temporarily pulling all non-English versions. My previous Steam title, ""Game Dev Masters,"" had machine translations, and around 90% of the total negative reviews were basically ""Translations are bad."" I want to avoid any negative reviews for Ceres related to poor translations. I am very sorry to any non-English players who had planned to play the game. I can't move forward with bad translations. If the game succeeds, I will re-invest that revenue into getting professional translations, but there are no guarantees of success.  
  
**Let's get into the patch notes.**  
  


* Added a new sorting option for your inventory to sort items by name.  
* Changed all machines from having a recessed name to an extruded name that is more visible from angles.  
* We have added sounds to the alien lifeforms. They will now make noise when they play animations above the flat plateau. To ensure it isn't annoying to players in their bases, they can only be heard when somewhat close to them.  
* We have added a new sky camera view you can swap to while placing structures. This allows players to get a view from above to ensure the placement of base modules aligns with their plans.  
* We have separated crafting material requirement texts into multiple text lines, allowing recipes to show which materials you have and which are missing. We use green and red texts instead of just making the text red if you have one of the materials but not the others.  
* We added a delay to the sound played when damage is taken. This will prevent the groaning when taking damage rapidly from being too annoying. It will now only play once every 10-15 seconds.  
* We added coffee as a drinkable liquid to the game. This new drink increases colonists' happiness and comfort and gives the player five extra max stamina every time they drink it.  
* I fixed a variety of issues that could occur when deconstructing certain base modules that interact with colonists. These should be mostly fixed, but I will continue to debug this issue to ensure it is fully handled.  
* Based on feedback, we changed the save and exit button locations in the options menu. We had an exit game without saving at the bottom, and a few players were hitting that by accident. So, we have shifted some button locations to alleviate this issue.  
* Fixed some issues related to colonist's jobs and how they were displayed.  
* Fixed an issue that could cause colonists who walked from the inside of the base to the outside to trigger your pilgrim to start losing air as if you went outside.  
* Some upgrades in the research HUD are now hidden by default if they were gated by other unlocks. Some players were unlocking recipes for the Advanced Base Constructor before unlocking the Advanced Base Constructor itself. This leads to players having no funding left when they realize their mistake. To avoid this issue, recipes are hidden until you unlock other things. You can also show all gated recipes to see the complete list.  
* We have added a new text message to the research HUD and the research display that tells you the most recent thing you unlocked or upgraded. This should help any players who unlock something and then forget what they just unlocked.  
* Fixed an issue with deconstructing the wireless power room that would prevent it from getting the correct power production/usage numbers when reconstructed.  
* Changed register storage to name storage as it was confusing.  
* We have changed the size of the decorations, such as plants. They were too small, but now they feel appropriate.  
* We fixed an issue where you could place buildings above the mission control room as the dish spins, allowing players to clip the satellite dish into structures.  
* I have added a new precision rotation key (Default CTRL). Many players wanted machines to snap, but the free-form building system I implemented didn't really allow for that. To fix this issue, I have added the ability to get precise and rotate by flat single degrees. This will enable players to line up machines to their base perfectly.  
* We have made a big proofing pass and improved all the texts in the help menu and item descriptions. We recently redid the data pads and mission tips, but now we have done the rest of the texts and improved them significantly. They are now much more straightforward and concise. 

  
There have also been some significant tweaks and changes to the mid-game and late-game, but since players have yet to experience these aspects, I won't bother to list all of these changes.  
  
This patch marks the finalized content for release. The following month focuses on aggressively testing for issues, optimization, and polishing. I still have a list of features and additions that I want to bring to the game, but these will be post-release updates. The amount of success the game finds will affect how much post-launch work we will do with the game, but even if it falls flat, I have at least 6 months to a year's worth of updates planned. Hopefully, it will find an audience, and I will continue to work on the game for many years, but there are no guarantees in game development. Thank you so much for all of your support and help with the game development over the last few years, and I am very excited to get the complete game experience into the hands of players.",1,1743619572.0,SurvivingCeres,0,1.0,False

## Why Upgrade to an Electric Tea Kettle?

Before diving into our top picks, let’s explore why an **electric tea kettle** is a worthwhile investment. For many, the reasons are clear: convenience and speed. Stovetop kettles can take an eternity to boil,especially if you have an older stove. An **electric kettle** heats water much faster, often within just a few minutes. This is incredibly beneficial for busy mornings or when you need hot water for a quick cup of tea or coffee.

Beyond speed, electric kettles offer enhanced safety. Many come equipped with **electric kettle with auto shut off** features, preventing the kettle from overheating and perhaps causing a fire.This is particularly vital for families with young children or those who tend to forget about things on the stove.

1jpwcip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpwcip,[MultiLines] Your oc overhears a weird conversation between two girls (readrules),"Quite the shining sun was illuminating the sky today. April just started and spring accompanied it a few days earlier. Flowers were already blooming through the alleys and roads while coffee shops and restaurants were full at all time during the week.

In that environment, you decide to take a trip down to a little establishment. *You guessed it, it's The East Coast.* Some tables were already taken. At one of them, two figures were talking nonchalantly about banalities, laughing about casual events in their day to day life. You may recognize Shime from a previous encounter, but the other lady, more quiet and visibly distinguished, was totally unfamiliar.

Maybe by curiosity or by chance, you start hearing their little talk:

""-How have you been doing by the way? I heard some random douche got killed recently. He ressembled a lot to-...

-Alexander, riiiight."" Shime answered, wincing a bit at the sudden remark. ""Yeah the guy died. Weird.

-Were you involved?""

Shime smirked and shrugged.

""-Not for his murder but he tried to kidnap me recently.

-Huh. I thought your father liked the guy.

-Hell nah he probably had enough of his inability to do anything right lately. 

-Aren't you scared he'll replace him by someone more competent?""

Shime answered her with a long, silent stare. She took a sip of her drink before shrugging.

""-Don't even get me started on that I am actually close to start employing mercenaries for my protection.""

The idol finally sighed and noticed your oc, which probably heard all of this serious talk. Her face changed quickly from concern to an absolute 'oh shit that's weird'.

""-Ahah april fools, all that shit, ahah got you!"" she went with an unconfortable smile. ""Hiii, how are you doing on that beautiful day?""

Rules and facts :

-Shime and Echo are 25 ✨

-It's a chill RP, don't expect anything too epic. It's just for character interaction and casual fun

-Modern fantasy universe : Magical ocs allowed

So I met my now Bf ‘25 M’ when I first moved to Spain in a coffee shop and we became friends as days passed we started dating, he is the typical guy who any girl wants he’s charming, very good looking and everything.
One problem was is he’s still friends with his ex, now at first I didn’t mind it at all since they’re both share a big friend group and were good friends before dating, but when he introduced me to his friends when we started dating almost two years ago (I never met them when we were just friends) she seemed nice but they were talking mostly in Spanish and I’m not very good at it I only know the bases since I’m in an international college and all my studies are in English.
The first meet up was nice, or I thought it was until a girl from the friend group texted me later telling me that she had to tell me something and she feels bad if she doesn’t, basically his ex ‘25 F’ was making a lot of mean comments with her other friends about me in Spanish, about my looks, my clothes, my accent and other stuff I did, I was so shocked I asked her if my bf said anything to stop her but she said no he just ignored it and didn’t comment on it.
I was pretty upset about I called my Bf to talk about it but he just told me “don’t trust everything said to you” “I didn’t hear her saying any of that” blah blah blah, and it was the first time we ever argued so I didn’t want to seem like the insecure Gf and dropped the subject and decided to just stay away from his friends better for both of us.
They all meet up every Friday at one of his friends place but since I have a bigger apartment and more space than any of them he asked me if they can start hanging out at my place, that was the first time he asks me for anything and we were dating for three months at the time so I didn’t want to refuse and agreed, they started hanging out at my place each week and she started making more comments in English like she wants me to know that she’s talking about me even after I tried to keep my distance from her, after a lot of time I was already done and thought of breaking up with him but I couldn’t because I was so soooo attached to him and I didn’t know anyone here but him and few girls from my classes (I’m not a very social person plus I don’t speak the language fluently) and I couldn’t do it at the time.
When it became too much and I decided that I’m doing it I’m gonna break up with him because he never defend me that night I went out and was sadly assaulted, since then he became more considerate he stayed with me the entire time, took care of me and stopped the hang outs, when the new Uni year started i thankfully recovered from what happened and was okay again everything went back to how it was.
This time it’s harder to break up because after what happened I believe that I can never survive without him and I’m more attached now, for the last few months I’ve been trying to do everything I can to make his friends at least to like me, I buy them a lot of good gifts, from week to week I hire a chef to come over and cook them nice dinners when they’re over with my bf, I rented a beach house for the summer so they can go on a vacation this summer but his ex keeps telling them that I’m just a spoiled rich brat who’s trying to buy them with my money just like I did with my bf, that was not my intention at all I was just trying to make good impressions maybe I went too far.
 the girl that I became friends with her from their group texted me last night saying that the ex is telling everyone that the only reason my bf is still with me is because of all the money I spend on him, I kinda don’t believe this because he never asked for anything or any of the stuff I gift him I just do it because it’s my love language, maybe I go all the way and sometimes too far. she even started saying mean things like “she’s unlovable and she knows that so she tries to buy it with gifts and money” 
I don’t know what to do I can’t leave him but I’m deeply hurt he never stops her he only defends me when some of his friends glare at him to say something or shut his ex up and he can never stop being friends with her and I can’t control that too, I’m so lost and I don’t know what to do, I don’t know if I can even break up with him.

1jpwaz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/1jpwaz5/arguing_in_favor_of_tariffs_is_easy_if_nobody/,Arguing in favor of tariffs is easy if nobody reading pays attention to whether what you’re saying makes any sense,"It’s very inconvenient when the perceived intelligence backing ideas greatly exceeds their actual accuracy. You would much rather read something from a layman who admits it. It’s almost non-hyperbolic for me to say that Oren Cass is the pinnacle of this problem, at least when his ideas manifested in [this WSJ article.](https://archive.ph/Tl0Lq) I wanted to believe there would be an interesting case in favor of tariffs here and was sorrowly disappointed; by all that I can tell, almost the entire article rests on the reader inhaling a few cans of Galaxy Gas and [inducing hypoxia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN3W4d-5RPo) before proceeding. I am only bringing in this level of snark because of how bad this is. I don't want to re-hash the Econ 101 picture of tariffs before proceeding; if you want some good background information, go watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr-Ld7DnBZQ) or pick up a microeconomics textbook.

His first argument in favor of Trump’s 10% universal tariff is that tariffs have long proven an effective way to collect revenue, with the early US government relying on them as a primary source of revenue. This is... true, because they’re an easy tax to impose, requiring control of only ports and borders. But Cass doesn’t even bother with comparing tariffs to other kinds of taxes. Do they cause fewer economic losses than, say, a VAT? The same argument would tell you that taxing people for rescuing babies from fires is a good idea. It would collect revenue, sure, and it's easy to identify the people to tax. But is this the best way to do it?

Cass also speaks of the United States imposing tariffs ""while growing from colonial backwater to continent-spanning industrial colossus"". This is just an elementary mistake in judging a policy: you need to consider the counterfactual case. If the US could have instead collected revenue through some other means, would it have grown faster? Again, this argument would work just as well for a baby-rescue tax, especially because by this point Cass hasn't introduced any evidence or reasoning that suggests the US would have been worse off if the government collected revenue by some other means. You could make a lengthy argument that other taxes are more efficient—here's [an explanation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/11/10/why-land-value-taxes-are-so-popular-yet-so-rare) of why land value taxes are much better than most others—but the more important point is that ""the US grew with tariffs"" says nothing about the usefulness of tariffs, because like how it grew with [high tariffs](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-070119-024409), the US also grew with smallpox and a lack of electricity.

Naturally, Cass argues that there is some value in producing things in America that a free market doesn’t see. There is plenty of room for arguments like these in economics. Public goods like national defense, for example, are a standard case of things that won’t get funded without government intervention, since they suffer from the free-rider problem. Pollution causes lung cancer, so it's sensible to tax it. But no reasoning or evidence like this is provided.

Instead, he begins by giving what seems to be the simple, and true, observation that economic growth and dynamism depend on a country’s ability to produce a wide range of sophisticated goods. He’s actually referencing work from researchers Hausmann and Hidalgo, which is a bit different from standard macroeconomics, but appears sensible, given that [the standard macro picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVAS-t83Tx0&list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM6L_I3IHvE85NHooK2Ln9Rm) says pretty much the same thing. According to the researchers, countries grow based on their knowledge of making things. The more [complex](https://www.ricardohausmann.com/economic-complexity) their products, the wealthier they are. The trouble is that Cass should give some explicit connection between tariffs and this concept of the knowledge of making things, but he doesn’t.

Hausmann and Hidalgo’s Economic Complexity Index (ECI) is used to measure this knowledge of making things. It's correlated with GDP per capita, which is itself correlated with [pretty much all good things.](https://jackthoughts.substack.com/p/how-gdp-growth-actually-works) But if you control for GDP per capita, population, and some other confounders, tariffs have a [negative relationship with this ECI](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/39088/Tuano_380692jt.pdf) (PDF warning). There still might be some endogeneity problems here, but the onus should be on tariff proponents to show that this policy works. Cass hardly makes an effort to do this.

Also notable is that [countries that score higher on the ECI (PDF warning again)](https://growthlab.hks.harvard.edu/files/growthlab/files/atlas_2013_part1.pdf) are [developed countries where services are a higher percentage of GDP.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-vs-services-gdp) (You have to make a comparison here yourself, but the correlation is easy to see.) Nothing about this argument makes any sense. [Hausmann himself wrote an article last week criticizing Trump’s tariffs!](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-tariff-war-misses-the-bigger-battle-by-ricardo-hausmann-2025-03)

Of course, it's easy to try to cook up our own reasons for why tariffs might enhance our knowledge of production. Maybe if you don't protect domestic industry, people can't learn by doing, but if you do, smaller companies get more revenue and can grow into larger, more internationally competitive ones. This is [the infant industry argument](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/07/did_tariffs_boo.html), which isn't really used in this article, despite probably being superior to whatever it is he's actually trying to say. That link I just gave also provides some more information concerning whether tariffs boosted growth in the 19th-century early US, most notably that ""productivity growth was most rapid in non-traded sectors (such as utilities and services) whose performance was not directly related to the tariff.""

Somehow, his next observation is even worse. Intel’s former CEO Andy Grove is quoted, with Grove saying individual pursuits lead to offshoring manufacturing and engineering. He appears to have been referring to how businesses seek cheaper options than manufacturing in the US or hiring American engineers. This, he says, hinders our ability to bring innovations to scale at home.

Strangely, two things are missing. First, no theoretical explanation is given for why businesses can’t solve this problem themselves. If Intel can’t bring technologies to scale without bringing engineering and manufacturing back to the mainland, ideally, they would choose to. Why can’t Intel pay for more American engineers and American factories if the benefits outweigh the costs? Perhaps what’s missing in Cass’s argument is some constraint on Intel’s ability to get loans and buy those things back. Would the entire industry need to come together or collude to get the job done? Or maybe, there’s some positive externality from American engineering and manufacturing, creating a free-rider problem. It’s not clear. But it all seems like a moot point anyway, because [engineering employment has actually risen in the US!](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=employment%3Bengineering) [Engineers are some of the most well-payed college graduates out there.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeP1wUtOt5czObNFT3Zskt3QirE1NXKeTvmgfaAK39M/edit?gid=553369045#gid=553369045)

The United States has continued to grow, developing and adopting new technologies in the decades after Andy Grove’s tenure as CEO of Intel, which ended in 1997. If we could have grown even more, it would be good to see evidence of this. Is there some country with broad, superior adoption of new technologies compared to the United States? We do have evidence to the contrary: [median consumption in the United States is higher here than almost anywhere else.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-median-income?tab=table) Weird! [How'd that happen?](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+does+the+economy+grow+in+the+developed+world) I guess the United States grew by finding lots of natural resources, rather than inventing the iPhone, expanding internet access, creating new drugs, or whatever it is Asians are doing instead of us, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak being famous Chinese men who benefited from this trend.

Cass then argues domestic production is important because local economies cannot thrive on services alone. There must also be an industrial sector, he says, to sell things to outsiders for the other things the community can’t make itself. We’ve already seen that the most prosperous countries also tend to produce more services as a share of GDP, so this is a mysterious argument on the face of it. [A fifth of international trade is services](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=World_trade_in_services), but somehow the jumps between small towns are wider than the Atlantic. We'll see in a moment, too, that countries most dependent on services for income are also the wealthiest. This part of the argument is just Cass saying ""you can't do that, we need something else people decided not to do for some reason!"" despite the obvious fact that people can, in fact, do that. But good for Cass if he's never had to sit through a Zoom call with a consultant on the other side of the planet; I would be pretty bored. This looks pretty similar to the bullshit jobs hypothesis, which is [equally nonsensical.](https://jackthoughts.substack.com/p/bullshit-jobs)

He claims that industrial activity has a greater multiplier effect, “rippling outward into greater local employment and investment.” Normally, the multiplier effect is used by macroeconomists to refer to how any dollar the government adds to the economy is later spent by whoever receives it, multiplying the initial effect on aggregate demand. The multiplier effect is greater when people spend more and save less. A cursory search suggests the multiplier effect is greater for manufacturing, but the multiplier effect is only relevant if you aren't at full employment and need to resurrect the economy a la the Great Depression. An industry having a greater multiplier effect does not mean it is a superior use of resources.

Cass then brings in a common argument in favor of tariffs: national security. A modern military needs advanced semiconductors, the processing of rare earth elements, and other things we would not want to depend on potential adversaries for. Thus, we should tax imports of those goods. But this argument only supports tariffs on goods important to military operations, not a 10% tariff on all imports. If this argument is important at all to the case for a universal tariff, you should show that a sizeable portion of imports are important for military operations. But the military clearly doesn’t need coffee, gaming laptops, and a variety of other things Americans buy from foreigners, and semiconductor imports are [just about 0.7%](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/semiconductor-devices/reporter/usa) of [all imports.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IEAMGSN#)

Cass is concerned about the trade deficit and is suggesting tariffs as a solution, so let's look closer at that. For beginners, the trade deficit is the difference between the market value of the goods and services we are exporting and the market value of the goods and services we are importing. It’s called a trade deficit when imports exceed exports, and a trade surplus when exports exceed imports.

Cass states that the US is running a $1 trillion trade deficit, about 3.6% of GDP. He explains that we should worry about this because it means other countries are owed further output in the future. It's also a problem, he says, because it has caused manufacturing employment and productivity to fall.

Unless Cass is using some weird measure of productivity I’m unaware of, this part is made up: if FRED is any indicator, [output per worker has stagnated, not declined.](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-has-us-manufacturing-productivity) [Meanwhile, manufacturing as a percentage of real GDP has remained constant.](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2017/april/us-manufacturing-really-declining) It would have been really good to have included a source here!

He doesn’t even explain why it’s bad that other countries can buy American goods in the future, or why we need a competitive manufacturing sector when the median American earner is making [18% more than they were 20 years before he wrote the article.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N) Is there some reason to believe that growth would have been stronger if we had a more competitive manufacturing sector? This is, once again, left as an exercise to the reader, as well as whatever ""competitive"" even means in this context.

That manufacturing jobs were lost is one of the only truthful parts of this narrative. But we are given no evidence describing where these workers are today, or a justification for why their job security should get special privileges over those of everyone else. (Normative arguments aren’t my main concern here, but it’s still worthwhile to point out holes in the normative argument being made.) “What happened to the manufacturing workers?” is actually a pretty interesting question [with some tragic answers](https://www.marketplace.org/2024/12/16/manufacturing-workers-jobs-factories-education-workforce/), but if the concern is over people losing their jobs and not recovering, it’s far cheaper to help them with redistribution than with tariffs. [Every job saved by the 2018 steel tariffs cost $900,000](https://www.piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/2021/scoring-50-years-us-industrial-policy-1970-2020). Doing tariffs instead of redistribution is like shooting heroin because you don't like the taste of Tylenol.

Cass lies again and claims that in other countries, policymakers have implemented tariffs and now dominate the production of pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, [nine of the top twenty largest pharmaceutical companies in the world (by revenue) are American](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/top-20-pharma-companies-2022-revenue), including the top two, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. If by some other standard this is actually true, Cass doesn’t provide that standard.

Along with pharmaceuticals, he claimed that other countries have imposed tariffs to dominate these industries. The truth of this point is less clear. The United States is [fourth in semiconductor production](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/semiconductor-manufacturing-by-country), with Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea ahead—all of them allies, mind you, who we don't expect to suddenly invade California. They [generally impose higher tariffs than the United States.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tariff_rate) Have they imposed higher tariffs on semiconductors? It’s surprisingly difficult to figure this out, but the only source I could find says [Japan doesn’t impose tariffs on semiconductors](https://ttd.wto.org/en/data/idb/applied-duties?member=C392&product=854159000&year=2023). I would greatly appreciate someone commenting with a source, since Cass apparently doesn’t have to provide these himself to get featured in the WSJ op-ed section.

The United States is far behind China in rare earth metals production, but [still takes second place.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270277/mining-of-rare-earths-by-country/) This might actually be a decent reason for tariffs, but imports of rare earth compounds and metals were [0.005% of the market value of all imports in 2023 (another pdf).](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf) Same problem as before: the proposed solution, a universal tariff, far exceeds the scope of the problem he’s pointing to.

The trade deficit [appears to be a made-up problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4j9z8s/repeat_after_me_a_country_is_not_a_company/), but tariffs don’t even seem to be a solution. Tariffs not only reduce imports but reduce exports as well. There are multiple ways this can happen:

* If tariffs successfully reduce demand for foreign goods, they also reduce the supply of dollars abroad, making dollars more expensive and American exports more expensive as a consequence.
* Many of the goods imported into the US, like steel, are used in production rather than consumed. So while some people benefit from the tariffs and can sell more, others are hurt and can sell less, whether at home or abroad.
* Tariffs invite retaliation by other countries, who impose tariffs on American exports. See, for example, the 2018 trade war, or... (gestures around)

In practice, tariffs have not appeared to narrow the trade deficit. The tariffs implemented by the Trump administration in 2018 [do not appear to have caused any deviation in the level of the trade deficit.](https://www.cato.org/publications/separating-tariff-facts-tariff-fictions#how-has-united-states-used-tariffs) I would point to something more convincing like a paper that uses an instrumental variable for the tariff rate, but this seems to be the best evidence available. [Here’s Chris Clarke on the trade deficit.](https://x.com/EconChrisClarke/status/1897460007685538135) Notably, he points out that when dollars are sent abroad as imports are purchased, they are either spent on American goods or invested in American companies—which is why fluctuations in the trade deficit are mirrored by fluctuations in an investment surplus. If we *did* have a trade surplus, we would almost certainly have an investment deficit, and then we can start talking about how tragic it is that nobody's investing in America anymore and we need to put America first.

Let’s try to condense the argument Cass is making to make this all easier to understand. Here are the things Cass claims about a 10% universal tariff, and the problems with each claim. He says that this would

* Cause higher tax revenues. (True, but no reasoning or evidence is given for the superiority of tariffs to other taxes. This is like saying we should ride our bikes into a wall because it’s good to exercise. Do we have to? Maybe just ride it someplace else? We could avoid the losses from a tariff by choosing some other tax. A VAT would avoid the incentive to vertically integrate created by sales taxes. A Pigouvian tax like a national congestion charge could even make things more efficient rather than less.)
* Not cause growth to decrease. (Evidence from the early US doesn’t consider the counterfactual case; there are also theoretical econ 101 reasons to suspect this isn't true and a whole paper providing empirical evidence for why it isn't true.)
* Cause greater production of physical goods in America, which we have a suboptimal amount of. (Reasoning and evidence given for the second point was terribly lacking. Nothing akin to a free-rider problem was described.)
* Lead to greater knowledge of production among Americans. (No explicit reasoning or evidence was given for this. Completely ignored what research around Hausmann and Hidalgo's ideas actually says, as well as what Hausmann himself believes.)
* Cause greater deployment of technologies in America by bringing factories and engineers back. (No explanation was given for why tariffs are necessary for this, and engineering employment is up anyway.)
* Cause greater production of physical goods in America, which would
 1. Be necessary for American communities to thrive, as physical goods must be exchanged for other things. (are you kidding me man)
 2. Increase employment and investment in America, due to the greater multiplier effect of industrial activity. (Not really relevant to whether manufacturing is a good use of resources or if we have an optimal amount of it.)
 3. Advance national security interests by making sure critical goods are produced within the borders of the US. (This is true of only a fraction of imports, making this argument insufficient to support a 10% tariff on all goods.)
* Increase manufacturing in the US, which is necessary because the country needs a competitive manufacturing sector. (No reasoning or evidence given for why a competitive manufacturing sector is necessary or superior to alternatives. No explanation for why entrepreneurs can’t capture the full benefits of additional manufacturing within the US. Ignored the fact that manufacturing hasn't actually declined.)
* Help the US compete against countries which have implemented tariffs and now dominate the production of semiconductors, rare-earth metals, and pharmaceuticals. (This one was pretty much just a lie but was in any case too narrow to justify a 10% universal tariff.)
* Reduce the trade deficit. (Economic theory and real-world evidence don’t suggest this would happen. No clear explanation was given for why the trade deficit is bad in the first place, except some motioning to falling manufacturing.)

If this article does anything, it shows very clearly why every academic is expected to carefully review existing evidence and cite their sources when writing a paper. I genuinely believe it should be used as an example in colleges across America of what you shouldn’t do. This also shows that you do not need to go to school to become a public intellectual, so long as you can find a way to sound vaguely smart without making a coherent argument.",13,1743619351.0,badeconomics,2,0.85,False

I’m having this strange cluster of issues and my PCP has been great, but I feel like we’ve run out of ideas. Since it doesn’t appear to be going away (waxing and waning over the last 18 months), I’m hopeful someone can help me find more things to explore. Even if I don’t get a diagnosis, I’d like to try for any possible info that can help me maintain or improve my quality of life while I deal with these symptoms. Throwaway account because this is so much info I’m sure it’ll dox me at some point. (lol…Hi, mom!)

Okay, huge block of text coming. I’m not sure how else to better organize or shorten this. 

Meds: Baclofen twice daily, Rizatriptan PRN, Albuterol Inhaler PRN (since a kid, now only when sick)

Truncated med History
- migraines since childhood. Med works great for these but doesn’t affect current “new” issue. Take it around 2x a year now, but in my twenties had migraines multiple times a month. (Have taken this med and similar ones during episodes in case this is atypical migraine, but it appears to have zero affect) 
- Extra teeth on one side of mid face. Removed with maxillary graft and sinus repair on that side. 
- Lap Cholecystectomy in early 20s for one large stone and many little stones. 
- History of subluxing and dislocating joints, usually when sleeping (shoulders, hips) or walking (hips). overall baseline is tight/not flexible though. 
- one panic attack like thing in HS (like 20 years ago) that resolved pretty well prior to the ER getting to me. It was during a sports try out (I’d done many sports the 3 years prior without issue. Never the best, but never had this issue and had fun). Trouble breathing, hyperventilated. I remember belly & chest pain, but can’t remember it specifically. I do remember they said if it kept happening, I’d need tests, but I can’t remember what they said they’d test for.  I obviously didn’t make the team and didn’t do formal sports after that and it didn’t happen again. 
- used to get heat rash if in direct sunlight for any length of time, but I’m not in the sun much anymore since childhood until my current job. I avoided it a lot because I’d get sunburns even with strong sun screen applied often. I also get heat rash easily when tired, so I’m just an easy person to make red, lol. 

Social:
- Through teens and twenties worked 40-65 hours most weeks. Career kept me inside, in controlled atmospheres. Exposures included things like blood bone pathogens, X-rays and methylmethacrylate. Work was excellent, and physically kept me fit without strains nor injury, was quite enjoyable, on the stressful side mentally but was not a challenge. Kept me on my toes with constant ways to self-improve and be more efficient, but was overall great for me physically, mentally, and emotionally. Was a lot of hours, but I come from a long line of “workaholic” types and for me it was a good work/life balance. 
- Recent career change 6 months before first episode (opportunity to switch to another fun job, but with more home time with the young family). Now working outside, but less hours (30-45 per week). Equal to lower stress job. No chemical or radiation or other exposures at this job (except outside more, lol. Mostly indirect sunlight, occasional direct sun light). Since episodes, this job is now 10-25 hours a week as I can do it, but I struggle in energy and strength and have lots of accommodations. 
- Nicotine use. Cigarettes, never vapes. 15 or so years of pack a day. Last few years at 1/4-1/3 pack a day. Trying to quit, but unsuccessful so far. Have not tried any cessation aides, only lifestyle/social changes so far. 
- Diet (for years, not new) is low red meat, lots of rice, rarely fruit, decent veggies, grains. Drinks are milk, water, coffee, tea; very rarely sodas, and almost never alcohol except a half glass or so a couple times a year (none last couple years). 
- Diet changes with this: craving potatoes in their many forms. Crave salt intermittently but often. I’ve never consumed so much salt in my life (BP for last year has been perfectly normal at all appointments). Crave beans, especially black, pinto & kidney beans. I was craving read meat at the start, but that’s mostly faded with occasional strong hankering for a cheese burger. My ideal food lately is a taco salad with extra cheese and pinto beans with a side of salt potato chips. I liked burritos and taco salads before just fine, but now it’s like how some people describe a ravenous pregnancy craving. I really wasn’t a “chip” eater before,  but now I’m buying chips & beans in bulk. 
- Pretty bad case of mono in mid twenties. Shingles in early twenties (left side: from belly button to spine, low ribs to mid belly) and had terrible chicken pox as a kid (on the whites of my eyes, down my throat; basically one big pock, lol). Possible covid once, but it was a bad fever and otherwise not terrible for a virus. Tests unavailable in my area at the time, as it was later in the pandemic but people were still hoarding home tests. Otherwise no major sicknesses I can think of. 


Current (this past 18 months) issues
- episodes of sensory issues and disorientation. I’ll be getting easily agitated and then be suddenly super tired with a strange feeling at the base of my skull and in my neck: full body pain, but much worse at this spot. Confusion, losing words, bad balance. Arms, legs & head feel heavy. Feels like someone is “pulling down” on my ear canals. Breathing feels weird (like I’m not getting enough oxygen), but I am moving air and when on pulse ox for these episodes it only dips a little (fluctuates high 80s to mid 90s: after episodes, return to baseline of 98-99). Only seems to resolve with time. Slight improvement if I lay on my side, head “looking up” on pillow and relax all muscles as much as possible. Ice packs on back of upper neck also help a little. Mostly, I just assume this position and fall asleep. Fighting the sleep doesn’t lengthen or shorten episode, but giving into it is more comfortable. I’ve been given a couple types of anti anxiety meds to take for these episodes, but I don’t think they help so much as encourage the “sleep it off” and remaining calm while I wait for time passing. The anti-anxiety meds cause sleepiness long after the episode itself resolves, and so I’ve not taken it the last few months for episodes and can get back to semi-functional faster if I don’t take them. After episodes for around 12 hours, frequent urination with notable volume increase per session. Then follows constant thirst. 
- The first few episodes were terrible, and PCP would send me to ER. ER would do various drug tests and release to follow up with PCP. After many episodes, PCP would request stat tests at ER (not able to do them elsewhere in my area) and ER would do obs, sometimes more drug tests, sometimes a “migraine cocktail” of meds, and refer back to PCP. I do think these first episodes triggered panic attacks and that lead care to take a more “obs then discharge with mental health referral” route. I was also very twitchy and confused, light & sound & touch sensitive. Sometimes giddy. I understand why they routinely extensively drug tested, but every time I was negative and drugs just aren’t my thing. I’ve gotten “used to” a lot of the symptoms and I’m not as scared of them (none of the episodes have killed me yet, and they’ve checked for all of the “kill ya quick” things as far as I know). I think this has calmed the “panic attack”/anxiety symptoms, but now I’m just… frustrated and sad it’s still happening and I’m still weak and less able to do things than before. So, as I mentally get used to this being my new normal with all it’s scary feelings, I’m not anxious about them anymore and that has gotten rid of some of the initial symptoms: not as scared, I can relax and the twitchiness lessens, I just calm into the episode for most of them… but sometimes I still get so pissed and sad. It still does cause some snappiness and agitations and is still affecting my emotions though. 
- no obvious injury prior to first episode. I was chilling at home with family on a day off. Said I felt weird and went to shower. End of shower was first episode and first ER trip. 
- Baseline (non-episode) symptoms include strange feelings in various body parts. Mostly often affects left side of face, like my face is tingly, or slightly painful, or feels like ants crawling. These sensations last 1-3 days. They’ve affected mostly left side face, and left arm. Sometimes left leg or right arm, or one side or the other of my belly/back. Occasionally right leg. Sometimes one location having issues will overlap with another, but usually not more than 2 at a time (except during episodes). I routinely test as hyper reflexive. My baseline was on the tight side, but since this started it is notably much moreso and “earned” me the “hyperflexia” tag in my chart. 
- if I’m having a rough day with a couple of the nerve sensations (like the feeling of ants crawling on my face is strong that day, or one arm is super sore and feels heavy & weak), I also often have trouble following conversations and really struggle with “sorting” sounds like having music or TV playing while having a chat, even if the volumes are very different. Similarly, I have trouble following moving objects on these rough days, like watching a car drive by quickly is super disorienting. So, on days my sensory is weird in a couple body parts, I also have trouble with my senses. 
- I’m drinking far more water since this started, and immediately after episodes I pee more. Then, for the day or two following episodes I’m constantly thirsty so I maintain my normal coffee/tea/milk volumes and increase water intake throughout the day. My stool also fluctuates between near-diarrhea (very loose, not well formed) and constipation (not super hard, but seems to get stalled/backed into my pelvis and is then large in volume and difficult to pass). I’ve historically been super regular in this aspect (6-7 times a week, usually same time of day, good consistency and color and normative odor), but now it’s still overall averaging once a day but is either urgent and near-diarrhea or a feel a heavy gut/can feel the left side working and then later (4-12 hours) have a very rough go. I’m not sure consitpation is the right term since it’s not a “long” time not pooping, but a density and diameter change more than anything. A one-off glass of miralax (when I feel my left side of belly doing it’s thing) seems to help keep it moving (even thought it’s still a bit rough, it’s better than if I don’t take some miralax), and so I’m doing that 1-3 time a month. 
- I struggle to eat some days. It’s like trying to continue eating when full but I am hungry and my stomach tells me I need to eat. I can force myself to eat, but it is slow going and frustrating. I’ve tried a wide variety of things to see if it’s what I was eating, but it seems to be that eating in the morning is rough and I can’t figure out why. I now start mornings with milk & coffee and a meal replacement drink, then a bit later I can start snacking until I work my way up to a decent meal in time for dinner. Sometimes I’ll squeeze in another meal after that, but I pretty much have to eat up until I go to bed. I’ve found something like a protein shake or bowl of cereal just before bed makes my next day much easier. I struggle to eat, but I super struggle overall if I don’t get carbs in on a regular basis. Increasing things like chicken and nuts and veggies helps, but dairy and potatoes and beans help far more. Even just sleeping a couple extra hours makes me weaker the next morning, and I think it has more to do with time from last food/drink than the sleep itself because it’s similar to if I stop eating a few hours before bed.  I lost weight when this all started, but am back up to “my normal” now. I have my muscle and fat back to my normal (same weight & same clothing fit), but I didn’t get back my muscle strength. My highest energy and mental clarity times are right before bed, for like an hour or two. They then rapidly drop to sleepy though if I try to push for productivity over maintaining bed time. It’s like I get a quick boost and then suddenly have to head to bed. I’ve learned to really lean into these moments to try to play catchup on house chores or enjoy hobbies, but I do get frustrated it so limited and neither resting nor slowing increasing activity seem to increase my abilities here (tried each stragtegy for months at a time: either increase ability  through slowly pushing to limits or resting more to “save up” energy.) 
- I’m overall weaker. My grip strength is terrible compared to what it was a couple years ago. Sometimes my legs or arms feel heavy and overall my global strength and overall stamina is absolute crap compared to previous to this. Both careers have been pretty physical, the first more than the current, but I struggle now to walk with a full laundry basket twice a day or control pouring out of a full gallon milk container, where I used to routinely to pick up 30+ pound objects many times an hour with ease and occasionally 50-75 pounds. 
- I’m, uh, dumber. I cannot do much of the complex or detailed things I used to do routinely mentally, like quick mental math or follow longer jokes and sarcasm well. I barely passed the “dementia test” thing, and the neurologist was like “you passed… but with your education and vocational experience, this should have been much easier.” With practice and time, I’m slowly getting much of it back (early in this I struggled to mentally add single and double digits, and was often confused in social conversations), but I seem to have plateaued these last six months. I’m okay, just not where I used to be. I don’t “need” this smartness back (lol, it would be nice…), but figured it was worth noting. My ability to mentally calculate time is gone. I have almost no concept of time, like my inner mental clock is erratic. I set timers  for important things, appointments, etc, and I have to have so many like “leave in ten minutes, get ready” and then again at “leave now” times because that ten minutes either feels like 2 minutes or an hour. 

Tests and treatment. 
- the baclofen does appear to lessen frequency and severity of episodes, and for sure makes the sensory nerve issues more bearable.  A couple times I’ve missed morning doses and both times I had like a “half strength episode” that sucked but I was able to wait until my next med time. 
- PT was okay, found movements that add to/ aggravate my head/neck issue, but nothing that triggered nor lessened episodes. The work (stretches, excises, massages) didn’t seem to help nor hurt anything obvious. One spot on my upper back/base of neck (belly of that triangle muscle from shoulder to head), if pressed hard does trigger my left facial tingling though. It resolved pretty quick, was repeatable, and lead to some ergonomic training and exercises to encourage me keeping shoulders back instead of slightly forward at rest. Holding arms out or up, while laying or standing, leads to more tired/heavy arms… but in general the more I move the more I’m tired and weak, so that wasn’t too surprising. My hips (and less so my shoulders) are not even in ROM, but I’ve known that (and the looser side is the one I’ve subluxed more historically). No major “ah-ha” moments in PT, but got some postural training and different movement ideas for better accommodating by new limits. Like, I can open a child safety med cap as long as I can place my palm on the lid and press the bottle into a counter at the right height, and then I can twist it open with my other hand, but I can no longer just palm and open a child safety twist cap. Overall, PT was worth the time and effort, but not a great improvement” in quality nor strengths, knowledge, skills, etc. 
- MRI of head, cervical, thoracic. MRI/A of head and neck. CT of head x2. X-Rays of head & neck, many views and positions. Tons of bloodwork: repeated comp metabolic panels & CBCs, various nutrient checks (B12, folate, magnesium) creatine kinase, thyroid, Lyme disease, mono, lipids, sjogten’s, blood & urine cultures, a ton of stool checks.  Most imaging was outpatient between episodes, only on CT w/o contrast was done during/tail end of episode. Bloodwork was mostly between episodes, but some during. 
- Test results: WBCs go way up during episodes, but haven’t been check this past year to see if they still do. LDL slightly elevated, but not worrisome to PCP. Creatine Kinase low-normal. B12 high-normal. Folate high (over 24 ng/mL). Free T4 perfectly normal, but TSH very low-normal. Triponin super low (below 3ng/L). Potassium low-normal (3.5, at normal/low line). BUN low. Alkaline phosphatase low. AlT low-normal. AST low. Protein total high-normal. Globulin high. Drug tests all negative, blood & UAs. Everything else is either perfectly normal or otherwise negative for what it was checking. 
- Imagine results: no blood vessel malformations nor leaks nor stenosis in head nor neck. Mild straightening of cervical lordosis, mild degenerative changes to spine throughout. No obvious spinal subluxations nor fractures. No MS nor other lesions noted (checked head, cervical & thoracic for MS). Incidental find of erupted cervical disc (might be affecting arm &/or face rediculopathy, but neurosurgeon & neurologist skeptical it’s symptomatic or even new: this triggered PT). Otherwise, all grossly normal by reports.  


So, what do you think? This is obviously hanging around, and I’m learning to live with it and have made so many life style changes to accommodate my “new normal” but I still hope there’s room for improvement. For both my mental health and my family’s financials, I’d really like to get back to being able to enjoy my hobbies, playing table top games without so much mental and energy limits, and not struggling to do basic work functions so I can increase working hours (the economy is rough, and while I’m back to work short hours now, we burned through all our savings that first year while I figured out my new limitations and made sure I wasn’t dying). 

I don’t need to win a card game or be the best at anything… but I’d like to increase overall stamina, lessen these episodes or at least their severity, and be able to baseline compete at the adult card table again, lol. I’m just looking for slow and steady improvements, if possible. 

What tests and/or medication trials would you explore? I’ve got an appointment coming up next month with my PCP where we go over this all again, but the last couple appointments were kind of…. “*shrug* glad it’s not getting worse, let’s carry on.”  I’d like to know if anyone has any ideas. Complete blue sky curiosities and wondering very welcome.

I want to ask all nannies and parents what is appropriate or not to ask because I am so shy to ask for things. 

I only work part time for this family and they have another nanny as well who also works part time for them. I will be the one going on this trip for 2 weeks in New york city from Santa monica because the other nanny declined (she was originally supposed to go). I have nannied for this family for date nights but the current nanny was looking to reduce the hours, and I was looking for a job during the week so it worked out perfectly. 

The reason I mention this is because on Thursdays and every other weekend, I work for other families, so unless I work for this family in New york city for 40 hours per week I would be losing money if that makes sense, since in Santa monica, I only work 20ish hours with them. 

We have only done super short local trips where I have driven myself and they paid IRS mileage plus time traveled plus overnight fee because I was in charge of monitoring the baby cam,and I would wake up with the baby. On those two short trips I ordered my food and my groceries,s simple but still costly of course. I don't want to do that anymore and I'm too shy to ask because maybe ""old"" nanny did not ask for those things and will think I am taking advantage? 

This family is very nice I promise you, but I know there are some nanny standards that not all parents agree with, even if they love their nanny so I just want to make sure I am not ""reaching"" asking for these things. They said I wouldn't have to wake up with the baby so I assume no overnight fee I can ask for though some nannies do? 



What I want to ask: 

1. reimbursement for Uber taken to and from my house and theirs because they said we are leaving together to the airport, and of course, I need to leave my car at my house 

2. A daily stipend for food? We are staying at the grandmother's house and I'm praying she has a microwave lol this family doesn't. Im trying to make it as cheap as possible. I would doordash groceries so I can microwave meals, a couple of fruits, coffee, things like that. I mean I'm not sure what Is cheaper, a flat rate per week or a daily stipend, so please help? or just send them my total at the end? 

3. Ask for a min of 40 hours Mon-Frid if not a flate rate because why would I go and loose money 

4. This one I'm kind of on the fence because I don't want to push it...do I charge immediately when I arrive at the house until I am asleep in newyork lol, meaning do I charge hourly on the plane since I am not in my home or is that pushing it? I assume I wouldn't be taking care of the baby because the minute he sees his parents, he screams lol he has been like this,s I promise you he loves me and I love this baby, but what Im saying is they would take care of him. I have seen nanny say online they charge or treat the plane ride as ""on the clock"" 

\*\*\*Anything else I have not thought of\*\*\*\*

Please help :)

About 2 years ago now, during covid I started getting pain in my sternum and shoulders by doing ring dips. I stopped and it has now been 2 years and the pain constantly comes up after exercise. I constantly need to 'pop' my sternum when I am sitting at my desk. The only thing that helps is getting some blood flow, but after the workout it tenses up again. 

I have been to my GP and done an EKG, chest x-ray, blood work. And everything comes back negative. She seems to think it is costochrondritis and recommends rest and physio. 

I am getting tired of this pain. It also seems to travel to my ribs and back scapula muscle after benchpress/ shoulder press. I haven't lost any strength and actually gained strength, but I need help or guidance to fix this.

Very recently we’ve actually starting to hang out a lot more, and a week ago we went to a music festival together with another one of her friends. It seemed like at the time she was into me because she was willing to go to so many events with me, and I was also really intoxicated (even though it was not an excuse I’ll admit) so  I decided to try to make a move by putting my hand on her shoulder a couple times through the day. As the day went on though, she seemed more and more uncomfortable around me and then just left during the middle of the last band’s set with her friend. A few days pass and she suddenly stops texting me (we’ve been texting back and forth for a while now, so the fact that she suddenly started ghosting me was sending off alarms), and just yesterday I finally met up with her in person again when we just happened to run into each other at a coffee shop. She pulled me aside and told me that my touching her shoulder made her deeply uncomfortable and that I should ask before doing anything like that again, and I apologized profusely before we both left.
Now I just feel like total fucking dogshit about the whole thing. How did I not realize she was not interested in me making a move in that way? How was I so stupid (and drunk) to realize that I was making her uncomfortable? And the thought that’s been plaguing me most of all: is there any way I can salvage at least my friendship with her?

- Lighthearted announcements without sounding over-the-top or forced.  Everyone seemed happy to be there, even with the delay.

We’ve seen stores lose critical labor, partners take on extra responsibility without extra pay, and have been promised offensively small year over year raises, all while the CEO was compensated over $100m in his first months with the company. Not to mention that gender affirming care was silently removed from the health plan despite the company vocally presenting themselves as “progressive”. By supporting Starbucks, customers are telling the company that this behavior, this treatment of its workers is acceptable. Corporations don’t change unless they feel pressure, and upholding the status quo certainly isn’t doing that.

And I don’t want to hear anyone say “no ethical consumption under capitalism”, this is Starbucks, not your smartphone, grocery store, or car. There are SO many independent and local coffee shops who pay their workers fair wages and properly staff their store, there’s no excuse unless you live in the middle of nowhere where other options don’t exist. I don't care.

Side: This is why organizing in the present day is so difficult, people don’t care enough to make even the simplest of changes to their habits/ behaviors even if it helps workers. Amazon literally opened a fire hydrant on organizing workers in Brooklyn during near-freezing temperatures but that didn’t stop people from keeping their Amazon prime subscription.

So I (25F) and my husband (27M) had our first child, Ellie, a bit over a month ago. My best friend (26F), let’s call her Sarah, is her god mother (I don’t have a sister or any female cousins, so that made sense to me) and her and her husband, Ben 33M) have been around our daughter a lot. 


Ben and Sarah have been dating since she was 16 and he was 23. Ben worked at a coffee place near our school where we went to. He had flirted with me prior to them dating but I kept rejecting him because he was way too old for me. When he and Sarah started dating, I disapproved heavily and I tried to get her to dump him countless times, to no avail. Me and Sarah stopped talking for a few weeks up until I realised I didn’t want to lose my best friend because of Ben. I figured she’d end up wising up about his creepiness and dump him. 


That didn’t happen. They got married when she was 22. Due to covid I had an excuse to skip the wedding.  I don’t like Ben at all and he knows that so normally he keeps his distance. 


Cut to last month. Sarah got tons of gifts for our Ellie: teddy bears, baby clothes and baby jewelry. I got my ears pierced when I was born and Ellie too. She also got her a little bracelet with her name and another that said “sweetheart”. 


About 3 days ago I called Sarah to ask where she’d gotten the jewelry. I wanted to buy a new bracelet since the chain on the last one had broken. She said she didn’t know and that Ben had been the one to buy them. It’s like a shiver went down my spine. 


I asked her why he had bought them. She said he wanted to get her jewelry to “have a special bond with her”. That just creeped me out. At the beginning of their relationship, Ben got Sarah jewelry all the time, with nicknames like “cutie pie”, “honey”and so on. I couldn’t help but make the connection in my head. 


I told her it made me uncomfortable that he bought her such personal jewelry and brought up how he used to do it with her too. Sarah got offended and said I had no issue with the jewelry until I learned it was from him or that I would have no issue with it if Ellie was a boy. She said I must be jealous that I didn’t have an older boyfriend that could get me expensive stuff when I was in high school. I hung up on her. 


I must have some sever brain injury, but I can’t see another reason why Ben would buy my Ellie jewelry other than to groom her like he groomed Sarah. I want to make sure that doesn’t happen and if it means not allowing him into my home it’s a measure I’m willing to take.  I just don’t want to ruin my relationship with Sarah.


I think I might be the asshole because I’m concluding something really extreme due to a simple bracelet and Sarah was right that I didn’t have an issue with the bracelet until I learned it was from him and that I wouldn’t have an issue if Ellie was a boy.

by Preston Dennett

A face-to-face confrontation with an extraterrestrial humanoid – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. It happens to a lot of people all over the world, and has been going on for a very long time. While many of our governments are now saying that UFOs are real, they still are saying nothing about firsthand humanoid contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? Is it because these cases prove that we are not alone? This video presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids of all kinds. These include multiple witness cases, some with compelling physical evidence pointing towards the reality of the experience. Now is the time for truth and transparency with this subject!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. It was 10am one summer morning in 1948 when Ernst-August R. was watching his sheep-herd in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Without warning, all his sheep scattered, and a large saucer-shaped craft landed in the field next to him. Ernst watched it for several moments, and when nothing happened, he approached it, then reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids in jumpsuits and helmets. The beings spoke a strange language then returned into their craft which took off. Afterward, Ernst found burned patches of ground where the craft had rested.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railroad worker Georges Godbout and two others were working on the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada when a top-shaped metallic craft appeared over the tracks. It moved towards them, stopped andthen  a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out from beneath it. He started to look around, but spotting the witnesses, it quickly climbed back into the craft. As the UFO moved off, it made such a loud noise that the three men became physically ill and had to stop work for the day.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, eleven-year-old Anssi Hakala had attended a cousin’s birthday party, and was bicycling along a forested road back to his home in rural Marttila, Finland. Suddenly a tall greenish humanoid figure appeared, floating above his head. And following him. Anssi biked away in fear. The being quickly disappeared into a craft, and the craft now began to pace Anssi on his bike. As it hovered over Anssi’s head, it sprayed him with a weird liquid which caused a tickling sensation. Anssi returned home nearly frantic with fear.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) went out to the rural area near his home in Bedarrides, France to pick some edible mushroom near his home. Bending down to pick some mushrooms, he observed what first believed to be two small children. But he changed his mind when he saw that they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted silently away. Skeptical of UFOs, Antoine wondered if they might have been Chinese spies.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of children from a youth camp by Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia noticed a silver flying saucer hovering at treetop level. Lights blinked around the perimeter. A light flashed on the bottom of the craft, and also on the top of the dome. There were several portholes around the edge, and through one of the portholes, the kids saw a strange humanoid with a very lage head looking down at them. The craft accelerated rapidly away and was gone.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (two eleven-year-old deaf boys) were walking up to the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway. Simultaneously they both noticed a glowing orange object just above the nearby treeline. Seconds later, it glided towards them, stopped, and landed a short distance away. They could now see a weird humanoid looking out at them from one of the portholes The craft took off, leaving behind unmistakable landing traces in the field.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10:00 pm on the night of August 31, 1978, at the same time as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias were amazed to see a solid, oval-shaped craft with portholes hovering near their farm. After moving around the area, it then ejected two figures with glowing red eyes who floated a few inches above the ground, approaching the farm. The two figures circled around their sheds, seeming to inspect the farm. They remained on the property for nearly an hour before finally leaving. It was one of more than twenty encounters in the area both before and after this event.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an unnamed boy was walking through a construction site near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the landscape around him lit up like daylight. As the light faded, he saw a craft sitting on a hill a short distance away. On top of it stood a strange humanoid figure. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He ran, tripped and fainted. When he awoke, he was surrounded by four humanoids. He jumped up and tried to fight them, but fainted again. When he awoke, they were gone. He noticed that the house next door had lost power.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10pm on November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund sat in the kitchen of his home in Daviken, Sweden drinking coffee, when he noticed a very weird-looking, short figure in his yard. The figure stood with legs spread wide and arms outstretched. It wore a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to investigate this strange figure, Rune watched as it disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police officer was stopped in his car as a UFO flew over him not far away and on the same night. Also, one year earlier, Rune’s neighbor said that he observed a short humanoid outside his home, which also disappeared into thin air.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one evening in the summer of 1999 and a fourteen-year-old girl was in the second story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Suddenly, sheard a deafening screeching noise right outside her window. Looking outside, she saw a very weird-looking, three-foot-tall creature with grayish skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, ran into the bedroom, and saw the creature. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how truly strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts are only a tiny portion of the huge number of documented cases on record. So many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. We are not alone!

They were the first company to make whey protein that didn't make me gag or leave me with an upset stomach. But the lack of new flavors leaves me wanting more, and honestly, the flavors they do have are quite subpar, especially when you compare it to their other lines. The current lineup honestly is kinda lame. 11 flavors, and some are way too sweet or pretty much the same. The Milk series – most of them are tolerable. The cookie flavors are great, at least in my opinion, except for Oreo Mint. The mint could be stronger, or that flavor could just be replaced. Heck, I'd like a York Peppermint Patty or just a dark chocolate-mint flavor. Cinnabon (why?)....and Cinnabon Pecan, I don't think they even tried to add even a hint of a nutty flavor. Coffee Ice Cream, I haven't tried mainly because I know I won't like it. The limited flavors, such as Strawberry Shortcake, Birthday Cake Oreo, and Coconut Ice Cream, were all too sweet or gross again.  I won't even bother with Vegan banana pancake batter.

At that moment Chris tells everyone to report to the cliff. For their next challenge. Every player stumbles upon a massive junk pile the three hosts are standing in front of. He calls the next challenge the Flight of Frontrunners! Teams will get ten minutes to take anything in the junk pile to craft a flying contraption. Their only goal is to soar as far as possible. Don chimes in that their flying contraption MUST be pilot-able and they’ll only have 20 minutes to build it. The rest of the team will push the contraptions off the cliff. Chef will then pick up the pilots. Obviously their distance determines who wins and who heads for elimination. With that Chris blows the horn, signaling the start of the challenge.

After grabbing their material and building contraptions the teams present what they’ve managed to build in thirty minutes.

The Golden Giraffes create a fancy-looking glider made with a stolen beach umbrella, cardboard wings, and duct tape. Jacques volunteers to pilot, claiming his “graceful skating” skills will help him soar through the air. He takes off surprisingly well but the umbrella flips inside out mid-air. Jacques panics, and does an accidental triple spin, to try and steady his flailing body. He ends up crash-landing into a tree but did land over halfway across the island.

The Victorious Vipers create a rickety bicycle-powered glider with cardboard wings and pool noodles for “stability.” Wayne decides to volunteer cause if they crash their head is as hard as a rock. The team is concerned. The second Wayne pedals off the cliff, the cardbaord wings rip off instantly. He falls straight down, bounces off a trampoline someone left below, and lands several feet away. Lindsay thinks this means they won. Kitty corrects that the last team would pretty much have to fly backwards. Wayne is hurt but gives a thumbs up. 
	
The Fierce Ferrets create a giant kite with a sled attached, reinforced with metal beams extra durability. Harold chooses to pilot as he “studied aerodynamics in Steve's fighter jet camp.” He has a good takeoff but the contraption is really heavy and decends fast Harold has no choice but to detach the kite and use the momentum to launch the sled. As a result he is flung far. He lands the sled perfectly all the way across the island.

After Chef grabs all three pilots he announces the Fierce Ferrets win again! They cheer, getting to spend another night in the spa hotel. Chef then reveals that the Victorious Vipers are going back to elimination as Wayne didn’t even clear half the island… or a quarter of it. Morale on the Vipers decrease even more while the Giraffes let out a collective sigh of relief.

The Vipers dejectedly head for the campfire, ready to send someone else out of the competition. Who goes home this time? The choice is yours!

Life is tasty and worth every moment, even the sad and bitter ones. It just makes everything easier.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jpvktd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alphaandbetausers/comments/1jpvktd/looking_for_testers_for_finsnap_a_budgeting_and/,Looking for testers for FinSnap - a budgeting and spending management tool with AI powered categorization and wealth simulation.,"Hey Testers!  
  
I just launched the MVP for FinSnap – a simple, privacy-friendly budgeting and forecasting tool with a few unique twists.

**Why I built it**

I’ve spent years in finance and kept running into the same pain points with personal budgeting tools: they’re either too rigid, too invasive (hello, bank linking), or just plain bossy (sorry YNAB!). And for myself personally, one of the biggest pains was going through my credit card transactions every couple of months and itemizing everything.

So I decided to build something lighter, faster, and a little smarter.

**What FinSnap does (so far)**

**AI-powered transaction categorization**

Paste in your CSV or copy-paste your transactions – FinSnap uses LLMs to auto-categorize spending in seconds. No need to link your bank account, so it's safer and more flexible. You can also just describe what you spent money on.

**AI-powered Budget Builds**

When making a budget, you can simply describe what you think the budget should contain. For example ""In 2025 I will spend $5.99 every weekday on coffee at Starbucks"". It will generate budget item for every weekday so you can compare on a daily, weekly, monthly basis how you're doing.

**Multi-currency support**

Supports USD, CAD, EUR, AUD, and JPY right out of the gate – great for travelers, expats, or side hustlers juggling accounts in different currencies.

**Wealth simulator**

Input your assets, income, and savings rate to get a sense of where you're headed. Uses randomized future paths to show a range of long-term outcomes (not just a single line).

**No data selling, easy signup**

Signup is easy, currently with the first month free and at $4.99/mo thereafter. Right now I'm looking for good feedback, so happy to extend free trials if you like where this is going.

**What’s next - Looking for feedback!**

If you're into personal finance, LLMs, or product feedback – I’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.

I'm building this solo and would really appreciate thoughts on UX, pricing ideas, or anything you think could make this more useful to people.
