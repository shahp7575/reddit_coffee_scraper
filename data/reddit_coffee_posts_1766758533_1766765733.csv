Some preexisting factors: 
>Our last name is 3 syllables beginning with V and already has an ostentatious lean. 
>We have an older son with the name Hugh and would like to avoid other names that sound similar or have very similar nicknames.
>If we have a boy we would like to use middle name James to honor a family member

Preferences
> We’d like for the name to contrast with Hugh. What I mean by this is we want something with punchier consonant sounds rather than a soft, gentle quality to it. Names like Wyatt and Lennox are examples of this. 
> We’re interested in names that have rhythm to them and are multiple syllable. The name Clementine is an example of this.
> We’d like something outside of the top 100 without being so unique that it’s unfamiliar or confusing to pronounce (as both of us parents have rare names, we don’t want additional names in our lives that we need to explain at every coffee shop or introduction).
> Finally, we’re interested in names with European roots, especially if they have English or Irish significance. 

Names we’ve almost agreed on, but have had a fatal flaw:
> Clementine
> Wyatt
> Lennox

Both are amazing. 

Here is the oner from Children of Men. The movie featured multiple long takes including the coffee shop scene, the 6.5 minute car scene. And the 10 minute apartment block battle. 

The oner from 1917 is the entire movie, so can’t link that. It’s very good and technically astonishing as well. So many extras. So much that has to be timed.

The room, full of engineers from every corner of the Milky Way galaxy, responded with chuckles. All except for the humans. They exchanged meaningful glances over their cups of coffee, and their senior engineer, Jeff, adjusted his glasses. *“Hmm,”* he said. *“Uplifting show tunes? Fascinating.”*

After the meeting, Jeff and his team threw themselves into the project, fueled by coffee and what the galactically acclaimed investigative journalist Zorpax Arblethorp would later describe as *“that uniquely human blend of ambition, lunacy, and a troubling disregard for ethical principles.”*

Nine months later, the Happy Doomulator was born.

Testing the device required a planet. A planet no one would particularly miss. The honor fell to Glormoklath, a dimly lit backwater world whose inhabitants were infamous for their distressing habit of marinating other alien races in boiled mud before eating them. Jeff, whose late grandfather had been one of the Glormoklathians victims, oversaw the test personally.

The Doomulator was placed in orbit and activated. It scanned the planet before bombarding every auditory cortex on the surface with an unstoppable barrage of cheerful show tunes. Helmets, earplugs, and even frantic screaming proved useless. Soon, the entire planet burst into a synchronized, pitch-perfect rendition of *Oklahoma!,* despite the fact that no one on Glormoklath had ever heard of it.

The climax was a full-orchestra rendition of *So Long, Farewell,* timed perfectly with the Doomulator unleashing a series of intense bass beats that shook the planet into implosion.

The weapon test was broadcast across all Galactic media networks, which promptly dubbed the Happy Doomulator ***“The Most Entertainingly Horrifying Weapon In Recorded History.”*** Weapons enthusiasts were especially impressed by its lethal efficiency, its profound psychological impact and its commendable commitment to showmanship.

Not everyone was thrilled, of course. ***The Anti-Uplifting Atrocity League (AUAL)***—a band of galactic activists led by a sentient cactus named Olores and a chronically unimpressed Tleguyian named Truq—staged a protest outside Galactic Alliance HQ. They also filed a formal complaint with the ***Independent Galactic Ethics Council.***

Humans, of course, claimed the moral high ground, arguing that the Doomulator’s victims died singing and dancing, which was more than could be said for most weapons.",1,1766765402.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

Part 1: As I Lay Dying

The lights are out on the Christmas tree. There is a terror inside, the body lies down on a cold section of the bed, and a small lamp on the nightstand flickers briefly. A moment later all sense of identity escapes through a crack in the firmament, and the body, while still alive, has no idea what or where it is, other than as place and location. Whatever it was moments before has gone, and the moist blinking of the eyes staring at the ceiling is met by slow, rhythmic breathing through two equally-flowing nostrils. But what it was mere moments before is gone, dead, as though it never existed, but nothing outwardly has changed, and there is still a recollection of things past, but only as a dream once awoken to.

Part 2: Bonnie & Clyde

Immediately, or eventually, we begin stealing things from the bedroom. Things that belonged now to no one, but might as well be repurposed, and shoved into a large backpack at a quarter-past-five in the morning, before the sun changes everything, and people begin to wake up, but only if they have to urinate or make coffee to cure their groggy and disfigured sleepy existence, and there will be some sort of animal, if not two or four, who need to be treated as children, and let out through a back door, which must be carefully avoided.

There is a sense of 'being-there'. It's not nothing, but it is not fully inclusive of everything, and thus fragmentary, but somehow dependent on the rest of the horizon of being, which might be trapped in this world—a world within a world—which gave birth to the concept of patriarchy; that this world was primarily inhabited by a man named Clyde, and we were something shoved in his underwear drawer, which we spied, and placed as much of it into our bag as possible, except certain items which seemed to be hidden in there—no—we would leave those there for all time.

Later, in the car, we made our getaway. It was our sense of being-there, together, inseparable, Clyde and everything else that wasn't Clyde, which seemed to be inside the body, but looking into the now-pinkish horizon which was calling, that we would follow, try to enter, but which would keep moving away, perpetually distant, and yet inside. Everything out-there, was inside. Drive. 'Away'. But 'from what', and 'to where'? Just drive.

Part 3: The Insufferable Lightness of Being

Everything that once had been in the 'here and now' spent itself like quarters in an arcade inside a discount shopping mall. Every moment was instantly gone, and gave way feverishly into another moment, which couldn't stop itself from disappearing into a void called 'the past'.

Then it became clear there was only 'time', which had nothing, no divisions, no past, no future, but which was constantly denuded, exposed, by some kind of presence, which was not hard to bear, but which seemed endless, as though time itself were a substance, which we either breathed or swam within, like you could move forward or backward, liquid, like something defracting and distributing light, impossible to cast a shadow within. The word 'when' became impossible to decipher, like the deepest cognitive puzzle imaginable 'when' such and such would happen, there being a destination for a moment which didn't already exist was mildly infuriating.

Part 4: The Creature from the Black Lagoon

A heretical notion eventually churned within like an empty cavern which beckoned one to jump inside, possibly a portal to a different dimension, which had as its conquest 'hunger'. There was the awareness, present and unavoidable, that one was in need of some kind of sustenance, and that procuring such wouldn't be as easy as running over a cat and eating it in the road. Something had to be 'purchased', there was this system of commerce which replaced bestial notions, in which prepackaged goods were utilized and devoured containing preservative chemicals and interesting names. They lived on shelves inside buildings next to parking lots.

It was clear that this being-there must include a systematic schema designed to trick people into giving one resources repurposed as trade-currency, by otherwise pretending to be useful in some fashion. One had to theorize about their potential value to other entities which had surplus inventory of currency, to include some kind of promise about 'being-there-on-time', which only raised the previous disgust about the concept of 'when', though 'where' could easily be disguised as 'there', and being-there had no trouble understanding that, because the horizon of being could never be entered. Eventually one would arrive 'where' they were supposed to be. But time remained enigmatic, as though the substance itself could be predetermined, and the literal and divisional nature of objects could be transpose upon a liquid and flowing substance which had nothing as its indicator—time as currency, time as sustenance, the idea that what cured hunger was prepackaged time, whose preservative was identity.

We wake up tired, drink coffee that promises energy but only delivers mild hope, and then spend the day wondering where all our motivation went.

Everyone pretends to be productive while secretly just trying to survive the day without forgetting their keys or replying “you too” when someone says “enjoy your meal.” There is comfort in knowing that these small struggles are shared by everyone, even if we don’t talk about them much.

1pw7u7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_urRobotCompanion/comments/1pw7u7l/gift_giving/,Gift giving,"I saw a post earlier on r/AmIOverreacting that brought up some thoughts. 

The worst gift I've ever gotten: an empty frame with two drilled holes in it. When I inquired about the holes my partner said he took off a metal placard that said ""just married."" He gave this to me after having dinner at the restaurant his ex gf worked at. This was our fifth anniversary. 

This gift is closely tied with a wood carving of two generic anime-style humans with a long inscribed flowery message about enduring love. It was tacky, impersonal, and weird to look at. Neither figure looked like us and at that time I didn't even watch anime making it even more strange. 

A time I misjudged a gift: an ex boyfriend replaced my brakes in my car for Valentine's day. I was a teen still and was upset it wasn't ""romantic."" Boyfriend looked real stern and told me ""not sure what's more romantic than keeping your ass alive, but alright."" 💀

Another time I misjudged a gift: I got a used Spice Girls watch with the gift-giver's hair stuck in the velcro as part of a secret Santa. I didn't listen to the Spice Girls or wear a watch. I never said anything thankfully, because in retrospect I think the family was poor so she gave something she had and liked. 

Unexpectedly thoughtful gifts from someone who wasn't very nice: a pregnancy pillow and a Hello Kitty body pillow. I was born with hips that turn in and I struggle to fall asleep sometimes because of hip pain. 

Gift I thought I'd never use but actually used so much I burnt it out: an electric tea kettle. 
 

Gifts I hate getting: 

-flowers that aren't cat safe. Stargazer lillies are my absolute favorite flower but they're toxic to cats, unfortunately. Poinsettias are beautiful, also toxic to cats. I appreciate the thought but I can only safely house them in the bathroom away from the cats and then the cats are pissed they can't come in the bathroom. 

-coffee mugs 
I'm one person and I have over 20. If they were from different people I wouldn't mind because they'd have no way of knowing. But they're always from my mom, and they always have cats on them. I also have two cat-themed aprons from her. I never bake. My famous line is ""If I've baked something for you I either love you or owe you."" 

-pink colored stuff or white/cream colored clothing
I'm not a pink person. I never have been. My mom knows this. White/cream colored clothing is simply because i'm clumsy and practical. If I can't get it dirty it isn't practical. 

-LOTION/CREAM 
I have sensory issues. I'm extremely picky about what lotion I will use in the rare instances i'm in enough misery to use it. Generally I only use Neutrogena Norwegian Formula hand cream when my eczema is bad and one tube lasts me over a year. The older women in my office love me because at least once a year I redistribute nice cream/lotions. Lol. 

-single use gadgets 
I don't need an egg cooker, an ice cream maker, a slap chop. The only single use appliance I need is my rice cooker, thanks. A big bag of basmati rice would be a dope gift, actually lol. 

-perfume 
I can't wear it at work, and I don't go anywhere else. Chances are unless you're family you don't know me well enough to pick one either. I still wear the same thing I wore in high school because it's cheap and I like it (Paris Hilton.) I have two ""fancy"" bottles from my parents I'll keep using until they develop off-notes and probably never replace. 

-milk chocolate 
I don't like/eat it. It gets given away. My neighbor Randy says thanks for thinking of him. I'm a dark, bitter chocolate sort of gal. I'd rather get some nice fruit than milk chocolate. 

-alcohol 
I don't drink. It gets given away. 

Gifts I love/would love getting: 

-handwritten notes
In the pecking order, this is highest on the list. I'm a sentimental fuck and enjoy being able to look back on them when I'm feeling low. I have a dumb doodle my brother did on a napkin from almost 20 years ago tucked in a box with my learner's permit. If you want to crawl into my heart this is your surest bet. Spray it with your signature scent to tug on those heartstrings a little harder. 

-turkey jerky/beef jerky(not teriyaki, any other flavor is good)/strong minty gum like the black Dentyne Ice/grape uncrustables. 

-physical prints of pictures of yourself/us
If I love you, I'd love pictures of you. Let me put that cute mug on my fridge.

-gift cards/cash
They don't take up any space. I don't need to assemble anything. I don't take offense to them whatsoever. Ya girl is broke and loves coffee. 

-socks 
I think my dryer eats them. I'm never unhappy about getting socks. I'm a millennial so you can take my black ankle socks from my cold dead hands, thanks. 

-a book that either means something to you, or that you think I'd enjoy/find beneficial. There's a unique sort of intimacy shared between people once you've lost the same number of hours over the same dead trees. 

-weed, lol.  5 10 threaded carts or flower, I don't fuck with edibles. Sativa or sativa dominant mix. 

-practical gifts 
Android charger cause I'll always need one. 

Batteries/a good flashlight. 

Stuff for my cats. I'd rather go without than have them do so. 

Brita filters, those bitches are expensive. 

Subcategory of practical gifts: 

-shit I hate buying
I got 18 rolls of paper towel one year, individually wrapped. 10/10 gift. 

Giant package of paper plates? Oh fuck, I think it's getting hot in here. Lol

O-Cedar Scrunge dish sponges 

Big fucking jug of olive oil. One of the weirdest gifts I've ever gotten but I used every damn bit of it. 


I think the gist of all this is, I can appreciate any gift unless it's one that makes it abundantly clear you don't know me/didn't think about it at all. And there's exceptions to everything. I got a gorgeous scarf/mitten/hat set in cream recently gifted to me by a patient's family. I adore it because they got it thinking of keeping my bald ass head warm on those cold winter mornings. They're not close enough to me to know I'm a mess-goblin, so I'll just do my best to keep it clean. ",1,1766765351.0,u_urRobotCompanion,0,1.0,False

1pw7sng,https://www.reddit.com/r/combustion_inc/comments/1pw7sng/anyone_else_wants_new_hardware_features/,Anyone else wants new hardware features?,"Hi! 

I have the version 1 since a couple of years. And I love it! However, I find that some features would make it more usable to me, and I wonder if someone else also feels that way. 

The two I encounter more often, is the lack of a battery indicator in booster/charger, and a quick/simple display for quick temperature readings!

The first one is a common request, but it works anyway. We just need to charge it before using, to make sure it is full. Knowing the battery level would be useful, but it is not a necessity.

In the other hand, I find that if I want to check quickly the temperature of, for example, water for coffee, or other quick measurements, like something cooked without the probe, and just want to make sure - I am better of with an instant read thermometer instead. That is reasonable, they are different products for different purposes. 

It would still be very nice if a future versión had (1) a little display on the charger, that could be configured in the app to show either the battery level of the probe/charger, or the temperature of the ""core"", or one of the different thermometers. (2) Maybe the thermometer in the point of the probe, could be a slightly faster reading one! That way one could choose that to be in the display, and be usable as an instant read thermometer. It doesn't have to be as fast as a thermapen (I guess tha t would be impossible given the thickness of the probe?). But maybe thermapop 2 or similar. 

That way, the predictive thermometer would be the only one I would need to carry if I wanted to cook in someone else's house, or to check temperatures in a busy kitchen.

Are there any feature requests you find would help you day to day?

I’ve (25f) been friends with this person (26f) since middle school. We have been on and off a few times because the same problems keep arising. She is almost always late to plans, flaky, doesn’t respond, and doesn’t give as much effort as I do to reach out. She’s a great person besides that truly an amazing friend but I don’t appreciate feeling like I’m pouring more into someone’s cup than they are mine. Anyway, she moved away about a year ago and I didn’t even get to say goodbye because again, time management. 
I’ve tried hanging out with her every time she’s visited but she keeps flaking!! Last minute at that! This most recent time I wasn’t going to go but I decided whatever it might be my only chance. Keep in mind she’s here to pay off some loans and she’s working whatever shifts she can pick up. Which totally fair! That day she wasn’t working for sure though. Anyway, I let them (her and another friend) know I get off of work at this time. 
I also said I have something to do real quick but i’ll be free at 3:30. We said cool we’ll meet up at a coffee shop by 4.

I quit that job a year ago and we were good friends but nothing out of work.

Every couple of months she texts me out of the blue

“Heyy (my name)

Whats uppp”

And then i answer and ask if she is doing ok

Then she answers 2 days later (?!?!)

“Im good maybe want to grab a coffee together?”

To “sync” (in her words, to be updated in each others lives)

But forreal, what do I search in that? I am so against being guy friend of a girl that I’d love to date. It seems so useless and a waste of time.

But it also makes me curious why she invited me to this. She already invited me once 9 months ago or so and it was like a regular conversation about how she is doing and how much she wants to quit etc.. but it was like ???? Idgaf lol if it’s not romantic then I see it as a waste of time really, but curiosity kills me with every invite.

She is very attractive and im ugly as shit i literally have no idea what she finds about me. I was also in a relationship at that time (now not and she knows it)

(Dont worry last time she paid for her meal, fuck that)

Anyone can decipher that or advice what should I do?",1,1766764976.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

The afternoon crash that no amount of coffee can fix. The mental fog that makes you reread the same paragraph three times. The aching joints that weren't there five years ago. The sexual function that's nowhere near what it used to be. The weight that accumulates despite eating the same way you always have.

Most people accept these changes as inevitable aging. They're told it's ""just getting older"" or ""part of life after 40."" So they push through exhausted days, accept declining performance, and watch their vitality slowly drain away while their doctors prescribe medications that manage symptoms without addressing what's actually broken.

But what if everything you've been told about aging is wrong?

At [Longevity Lab in Las Vegas](https://lvlongevitylab.com), a radically different approach is helping people reclaim the energy, mental clarity, physical capability, and sexual vitality they thought were permanently lost. The secret isn't accepting decline—it's understanding that your body has been screaming for help, and finally learning to listen.

# Your Body Is Sending Distress Signals You're Probably Ignoring

Chronic disease or dysfunction doesn't appear overnight. The signs are in your bloodwork, your stress levels, your inflammation, and your DNA. Most people visit doctors who run basic tests, find nothing dramatically wrong, and send them home with reassurances that everything's ""normal."" Meanwhile, the cellular machinery that powers your body is quietly breaking down.

Your mitochondria—the tiny power plants inside your cells responsible for producing energy—start working improperly, leaving you tired, foggy, and slow to recover. Poor mitochondrial function is linked to aging, inflammation, and virtually every chronic health issue. Yet traditional medicine rarely investigates until serious disease develops.

Your telomeres—the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes—wear down faster when lifestyle, stress, and inflammation accelerate aging at the cellular level. Two people born the same year can have dramatically different biological ages depending on how their cells are actually aging, not just how many birthdays they've celebrated.

Your hormones quietly shift out of balance, affecting mood, metabolism, libido, sleep, and body composition. Most doctors check hormone levels once a year at most, missing the nuanced picture of how your body actually processes these critical chemical messengers.

This is why Longevity Lab starts with something radical: actually looking at what's happening inside your body at the cellular level before problems become diseases.

# The Most Intriguing Breakthrough: Seeing Aging Before It Happens

Longevity Lab uses advanced testing to measure how well your mitochondria are performing and how balanced your levels of NAD+ are—a critical coenzyme that helps turn nutrients into energy and supports DNA repair. When NAD+ levels drop (which happens progressively with age), your energy, metabolism, and brain function collapse. But unlike age itself, NAD+ levels can be restored.

Through NAD+ IV infusions, light therapy, and targeted supplements, they restore energy production at the cellular level. Clients describe feeling a vitality they hadn't experienced in decades—not through stimulants or temporary fixes, but by actually repairing the fundamental machinery that creates energy.

The telomere testing determines your biological age—which may be older or younger than your actual age. This single insight transforms how you think about health. You might be 50 chronologically but 42 biologically if you've taken care of your cells. Or you might be 45 but biologically 58 if stress, inflammation, and poor cellular health have accelerated aging. Once you know your biological age, you can implement targeted strategies to slow or even reverse cellular aging.

# The Testing That Changes Everything

Longevity Lab uses blood testing to check key hormone levels like testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, but they don't stop there—they also use the DUTCH test, a specialized urine test that shows how your body is processing and clearing those hormones.

This distinction is crucial. Two people might have identical testosterone levels on standard blood tests, yet one feels energetic with strong libido while the other suffers from fatigue and sexual dysfunction. The difference is often in how the body metabolizes hormones—information standard testing completely misses but the DUTCH test reveals.

They test gut health to uncover imbalances causing bloating, fatigue, inflammation, or mood issues. They assess adrenal rhythm showing how stress hormones like cortisol fluctuate throughout the day, impacting sleep, energy, and recovery. They check for insulin resistance silently contributing to weight gain and fatigue long before diabetes develops. And genetic panels identify markers influencing how your body handles everything from detox and inflammation to nutrient absorption and longevity.

This comprehensive picture reveals exactly where your body needs support rather than guessing or treating generic symptoms.

# The Early Detection That Saves Lives

Perhaps the most powerful service Longevity Lab offers is catching disease before it becomes life-threatening. They use the Galleri blood test, a cutting-edge screening that can detect signals from over 50 types of cancer through a simple blood draw, often before traditional tests would catch them.

Think about what this means: cancers detected early, when they're most treatable, rather than after symptoms appear and the disease has progressed. They also offer full-body thermography, a safe, radiation-free imaging method detecting abnormal heat patterns in the body, helping identify areas of inflammation, vascular congestion, or early-stage changes.

Their cardiovascular risk analysis assesses factors like cholesterol, blood pressure, and inflammation markers to help prevent heart disease—the leading cause of death in the U.S. Most people discover they have heart disease after a heart attack. Longevity Lab identifies risk years earlier when prevention is still possible.

# Reclaiming What Age Has Stolen

The clinic's approach to sexual health exemplifies their philosophy: Sexual wellness is often one of the first aspects of health to decline with age, but it doesn't have to be permanent. They work with both men and women to evaluate hormone levels, identify underlying causes of decreased libido or performance, and restore balance through non-invasive, science-based therapies that improve pelvic function, increase sensitivity, and support sexual confidence—without surgery.

Most doctors dismiss declining sexual function as inevitable aging. Longevity Lab treats it as the symptom of underlying hormonal, vascular, and cellular dysfunction—all of which can be addressed. Clients report not just restored function but enhancement beyond what they experienced even in younger years once hormone optimization and cellular health interventions take effect.

For energy restoration, they identify and treat hidden factors that drain vitality: sluggish mitochondria, hormonal dysregulation, micronutrient deficiencies, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Through NAD+ IV infusions, mitochondrial support, and light-based treatments, they optimize energy production at the cellular level. Many clients report sharper focus, stronger physical performance, enhanced sexual function, better sleep, and sustainable energy they haven't felt in years.

# The Movement Revolution: Pain-Free Living at Any Age

For joint pain and slow recovery—often the first signs of aging—Longevity Lab offers regenerative therapies including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, stem cell or exosome therapies, and peptides like BPC-157, TB500, and Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M) treatments for osteoarthritis. Paired with EMSculpt and light therapy to strengthen muscles and reduce joint stress, their programs help clients stay active and pain-free without surgery or chronic medication.

These aren't experimental treatments—they're scientifically validated regenerative therapies that harness your body's natural healing capabilities. The difference between managing pain with medications versus actually repairing damaged tissue is the difference between surviving and thriving.

# The Cognitive Edge You Thought Was Gone

For brain fog and mental fatigue, they address root causes: imbalances in stress hormones, blood sugar dysregulation, nutrient depletion, inflammatory load, and mitochondrial dysfunction. They integrate NAD+ therapy, methylene blue, B-vitamin support, stress-adaptive protocols, and inflammation-reducing IVs to rebuild neurological health from the inside out, restoring clarity, memory, and the focus that allows you to stay sharp and present throughout the day.

Clients describe the cognitive transformation as shocking—suddenly remembering names effortlessly, processing information quickly again, and experiencing mental energy that makes complex work feel engaging rather than exhausting.

# Why Aesthetic Health Matters More Than Vanity

Longevity Lab's aesthetic services complement internal health improvements. When your body is hormonally balanced, nutritionally supported, and functioning optimally, it naturally reflects in your appearance—glowing skin, brighter eyes, confident posture. They offer targeted aesthetic treatments including hair restoration guided by DNA testing, skin rejuvenation using PRP and light therapy, body sculpting with EMSculpt, and regenerative injectables that address causes of aesthetic decline, not just symptoms.

This isn't about vanity—it's about the psychological impact of looking in the mirror and seeing vitality rather than decline. The confidence that comes from feeling and looking your best creates positive cycles where you're more motivated to maintain healthy behaviors.

# The Hormone Optimization That Changes Lives

After thorough testing including blood and advanced urine analysis, they create personalized hormone replacement plans that may include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, thyroid support, or adrenal therapy. As levels rebalance, many clients experience improved motivation, reduced brain fog, stable mood, stronger sexual function, and a renewed sense of self.

Hormone optimization isn't just about feeling better—it's about restoring the biological state that allows your body to build muscle, burn fat, think clearly, sleep deeply, and maintain sexual function. These are the fundamental capabilities that define quality of life.

# The Proactive Approach That Defines Everything

Longevity Lab focuses on proactive care, looking ahead and assessing risk based on biomarkers, genetics, and personal history. Using tools like Galleri multi-cancer screening, full-body thermography, telomere analysis, and inflammation mapping, they understand where your body is headed and intervene early, building sustainable long-term plans that evolve with you and reduce risk of chronic illness, disability, and decline.

This is the fundamental difference: reactive medicine waits for disease and then manages it. [Longevity medicine](https://lvlongevitylab.com) prevents disease by maintaining optimal cellular function. The contrast is stark—one path leads to accumulating diagnoses and medications, the other to sustained vitality and independence.

# The Reality Check You Need

Here's what nobody tells you about aging: the decline you're experiencing isn't inevitable biological destiny. It's the result of cellular dysfunction that can be measured, understood, and addressed. Your fatigue isn't ""just aging""—it's mitochondrial dysfunction and hormone imbalance. Your brain fog isn't ""senior moments""—it's inflammation and nutrient deficiency. Your declining sexual function isn't something to accept—it's hormonal and vascular issues with specific solutions.

Longevity Lab was developed for people ready to take complete control over their health and happiness—professionals, parents, business owners, athletes, and everyday people who want to live with more energy, confidence, and control over how they age.

The question isn't whether these interventions work—the science is clear. The question is whether you'll continue accepting decline as inevitable or take the radical step of actually optimizing how your body functions.

Your body has been sending distress signals. The fatigue, the fog, the pain, the declining performance—these aren't normal. They're cries for help from cells that aren't getting what they need to function properly. Longevity Lab has the tools to hear those signals and respond with precision interventions that restore cellular health.

The alternative is watching another decade slip away, accumulating diagnoses, accepting limitations, and wondering what life might have been like if you'd acted sooner. Some choices have small consequences. This one defines the quality of every day you have left.",1,1766764890.0,u_Legitimate_Sweet2188,0,1.0,False

*Draconis Cluster, Unaffiliated Collective Cargo Ship* Divine Breeze

Misabel was moving through the hatchways of the ship, carefully avoiding the walls and sparking conduits from the ceiling. The *Divine Breeze* had been on the receiving side of an adventure during their last trip to Antares, and was undergoing rapid repairs - still, certain tasks had to be performed and there was a limit to the secrecy of the communication. She dodged around repair teams and finally found her way to the bridge, and then went down a stairwell that was concealed by the command chair itself.

As she walked down, she had a slight inward headshake of sorts - Itrop was not someone who denied himself luxury if possible. His private space was a study in minimalist decadence. The cushions were few but opulent and soft, and there was a bowl of peeled fruit set out openly on the polished wood table, along with a large glass of chilled juice; the scent of the room was . There was a casual gesture to Misabel, bidding her to sit amongst the comfort. The ever-present Bob was ensconced in its corner - overall, that was quite possibly the least disconcerting thing about the room. Misabel's arm moved of it's own volition to cover her stomach.

""Your child is well, I take it?"" Itrop's tone was mild. Borderline caring, if someone didn't know what lay beneath.

""Yes, m'lord. The doctors indicated the possibility of twins.""

""Does Chapma know?""

She shook her head. ""I was planning on telling him when there is certainty.""

There was a slight nod of approval from Itrop. ""Well-considered. What does your husband say of his new position?""

For the first time, there was a hesitation in Misabel's reply. ""He admits to being confused. Not so much by the work, but by his..."" there was silence as she searched for the right word ""...co-workers. They have their own rhythm, speech. It's a casualness unseen within the fleets of Hurdop or Vilantia. Their leaders act like gentle tutors for the most part, and insults that would merit proper challenge are simply returned in kind. The only time they are truly angry with their charges in when something dangerous is done. But then there was a reaction to certain outsiders that was...disproportionate.""

""Go on?""

""There was...an incident of sorts. Chapma was socializing and watching a game at a tavern when a group from another mercenary company came in - ostensibly to watch, but it seemed as if they were there to be disruptive. He noted that several insults were used that had been thrown about earlier in the day that were laughed at, but from another company they actually merited...not even a challenge, there was simply a fight - rather brutal, but when it was mentioned the next day, their section captain simply asked if there were any personnel still in the hospital and if all the fines had been paid. It is as if inside the group all is forgiven, but outside nothing is tolerated."" Misabel paused. ""Outside of football, he doesn't mention socializing much.""

Itrop considered this. ""And what does he think of his...commander?""

""Gryzzk is perhaps the most confusing one of all. From what Chapma has learned, it's almost like there are three or even five from their actions. In the normal day-to-day, he seems to almost be an overworked clerk. At social gatherings, a commoner willing to drink and brawl at any wrong scent. From what is spoken of his home life, he is a devoted husband who orbits the gravity of his family. But in battle exercises, he is an audacious warlord who lives by the watchphrase 'never tell me the odds.' When dealing with employers or other functions that intersect with noble classes, he is the epitome of a lord."" She sighed softly. ""I think a large amount of this is who he surrounds himself with - it makes him ignore proper convention.""

Itrop considered this. ""Encourage your husband to socialize more. If necessary, tell him that you have found additional employment as a courier within the cluster, so he can spend more of his earnings on himself. But ensure he remembers his first duty."" There was a gentle hand-motion. ""Go and attend to your other duties.""

""Of course, my lord."" Misabel stood and exited, forcing her own uncertainties about this deep down where no nose could scent them.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk was in his quarters on the bridge, reading through the brief for the next job. He was also enjoying the quiet with his plants. As much as he loved his family, there were times when an amount of solitude was needed.

First and foremost, *Clanmother's Curry* had hired on a medical technician and a second engineer from the clan. It was warming in a few ways - they left with Gryzzk promising the two that they'd still have a place at Homeplate if it was needed, but almost dismissed the thought out of hand. Jojorn's scent was changing in some ways; it was subtle, but it brought memories of Gro'zel forth, somehow. He studiously ignored Yorkime and Nhoot as they took their own tentative steps toward whatever future they might have.

True to their word, the Pavonians had indeed extended for the duration of their next job - on the up side, it was supposed to be a simple run to Eridani and the majority of it would be in R-space. Ten days there, four days on station explaining to the Eridani that they were a blend of military and business, and participate in exercises that would hopefully convince the Eridani that it was better to be friendly, and finally ten days back. Since they couldn't exactly resupply in R-space, every spare millimeter of the ship had been converted to cargo storage for spare parts and printmass, which shrank the hallway height by an amount that was going to make life difficult for the Moncilat.

He was looking over astrogation charts and scans of the system to familiarize himself with what they'd be dealing with. It wasn't a pretty system. Two separate belts of asteroids and a planetary ecliptic that was at best theoretical due to the presence of a brown dwarf in the system along with the main star. While habitable, it wasn't pleasant - at least from his perspective. He took a look at the native species and felt a chill of primal fear shiver through his body.

The natives were Helots - at least physically. He'd heard stories about them from Edwards - they were the implacable foot soldiers that the Geneoirs had used to test new species entering the Collective. In theory, the testing done was to determine a species' place within the Collective; at least before the Terran Contact. After Terran Contact, the Geneoirs were 'advised' to pursue other avenues of research - they agreed, since they now had the necessary data for whatever experiment they were running. It was altogether disconcerting.

Rosie appeared, interrupting his study. ""Freelord, you got a visit from your boss - so anytime you want to say hi you can stand up.""

Gryzzk looked up and saw Lieutenant Colonel Williams standing with a light smile on his face.

There was a brief moment of panic as Gryzzk was caught in a relaxed posture - he stood and saluted his superior without even considering it. The salute was returned with mild amusement.

""At ease Major. I'm just delivering a package from Skunkworks - came in hot, Terran Diplomatic Support Services seemed to think it was important that you get this before tomorrow. Crack it open once you leave the dock and share it with the other companies."" Williams seemed almost nostalgic as he looked around the bridge, handing over the data-tab. ""Running your own company. Head of a battalion of other companies. Even got copy-cats looking to catch lightning in a jar a couple more times. You're everything I'd hoped for when we hired you on. More, really.""

""Thank you. I...I should have stopped by more often.""

There was a wave in return. ""No, no. You stopped by as often as you needed to. I'm pleased that it wasn't often. Not to...not to put too fine a point on it but bringing your folks in was...a good capstone to a career.""

Gryzzk cocked his head slightly. ""Colonel, you sound like you're reminiscing.""

""Because I am. Let's not kid ourselves. I'm fifty-nine, and after the Kerfluffle General Sinclair kicked me to a desk job in Personnel for few more months till I hit the magic number."" There was a soft exhalation, and a quick glance at his silver oakleaf insignia. ""In four decades, I've made a pile of creds. Add some good investments on top of the usual retirement plan, and I can pretty much retire to any place that's not Anchiano Colony. If this job you're on does good there'll be expansion in that direction. Collective'll probably put up some funds for a new way-station or three.""

""Why wouldn't you stay here?""

There was a soft laugh. ""Some do, but - for me, not so much. Never married or had kids, so this place..."" he shook his head. ""I'd meddle in stuff and think I was still in charge. I never was one for planets. Something about 'em, you just look up and there's no ceiling to see, nothing to know that something’s keeping the atmo from boiling out and leaving you a desiccated slab of meaty absolute-zero debris for someone to find. I think I'll take my talents to the frontier, sign on with a cargo hauler or a station that needs some security. Maybe let my hair grow out finally. You're young, so there's just one thing you need to learn now.""

""What's that?""

""Whatever you do with your career - don't let them promote you. Don't let them transfer you. Don't let them do anything that takes you off the bridge of this ship. As long as you're in that chair, you can make a difference. Not any big galaxy shaping things; but the little stuff. Giving folks jobs. Adopting a little girl from the other side. All the little stuff you do, making the worlds around you a little better.""

Gryzzk smiled a little. ""With respect, sir - why didn't you get married? I mean it seems to be the officer's requirement.""

Williams rocked back on his heels. ""Well, there was one time. Back when I was a shavetail louie, we were on a security detail for this mining station out working on Jiangyin III. Another company wanted to do a hostile takeover of the station, and we got hired on to make sure the roughnecks didn't get too rough. End of it all it was a good day's work, a good days pay, and then celebration I came upon this...calling her a woman doesn't do her justice. Everything was right. She knew it, I knew it. It was a good evening, but in the morning we had coffee and knew that was all it was ever gonna be. She was a miner, I was a trooper and if either of us pulled up stakes to be with the other we'd resent it. So we both agreed that it wasn't ever going to get any better than it already was, I hopped on my shuttle and we got the hell on to our next job while she got on to telling her crew to get back to breaking rock.""

""Perhaps you should look her up.""

There was a soft snort. ""No thanks, Major. I'd rather she remember me as the cut slab of beefcake I was back in the day. Hell, I'm gonna need to take tomorrow off just standing here talking to you."" Williams shook his head. ""Like I said, it'd never get any better than it was that night. Anyway, you've got a job to do, and I've got dust to collect.""

In the evening Gryzzk went home to the exit dinner of corned beef hash and a night of discussion with the O'Briens. Gryzzk settled in next to Grezzk, and Kiole lay across the two of them almost possessively as they watched the holo. As was tradition for watching sports, there were pints in hand - the mister O'Brien was the odd one out in this situation, as he was the only one with a chilled pint.

Gryzzk was not thinking about the match overmuch. ""So...the new hires-""

O'Brien shook her head and tossed a pillow at Gryzzk casually with her free hand. ""No need for that tonight. Galway United's playing your Orbital Palace lads in a pair of friendlies - and we'll not know the results of the other one until we're other side of R-space so shut up, drink your pint, and cheer for the wrong team y'wee madman. We'll talk about the new hires in R-space.""

""For the record, my club is Elsife Village United.""

""Madman."" With that declaration completed, O'Brien leaned into her husband and ran her fingers through his beard. ""God forgot to install the off switch when he made my favorite Major.""

The game progressed, and as this game was being played by Terran rules and at Terran gravity it was a complete wipeout in favor of the visiting team. Gryzzk grumbled softly about the Terran rules and the incomprehensible thing that was 'offsides'. Once the match ended, the children were put to bed and the O'Briens were given the farewell leftovers, and finally it was time to worry about the morning.

As was standard, Gryzzk awoke far too early and used the time to take care of the infants one more time before starting breakfast for everyone. It only took a few minutes for Nhoot to come bounding out to the scent of the morning tea, already dressed in her formal uniform. She was almost vibrating in excitement as she grabbed some turkey sausage and eggs, very carefully breaking them open as she did supervised cooking time with Papa.

""Lieutenant?"" Gryzzk noted her current state was...rumpled.

""Yes, Papa?""

""Why is your uniform wrinkled?""

Nhoot looked guilty as over-easy became scrambled in short order. ""I didn't want to forget this morning. So I stayed awake and put it on after you went to bed.""

There was a slight exhalation of disapproval. ""I distinctly approve on the enthusiasm for your duties. However, you are an officer and the formal uniform is the highest expression of that. Attention to detail and an orderly appearance. It will not do to appear before your crew looking poorly. Once you are done eating breakfast, go into your room and try again.""

It took some time, but eventually everyone rose and prepared for the day ahead. Gryzzk and Kiole shamelessly lavished affection on the twins while Gro'zel fastidiously inspected Nhoot before she was deemed ready to be given a Papa-inspection, and at the end of it there was a long moment with the entire family before they all went their separate directions.

The officers and senior NCOs were all in their formal uniforms standing behind Gryzzk as he addressed the enlisted formation. Gryzzk took a quick inhale and noticed that there was a bit of apprehension on the wind as well as a decent amount of confidence. The Pavonians were off to the side, with Mulish taking notes.

""Troop. Some of you know what's coming and for some of you this is new. Behind us is your home for the next month. Treat it properly. Ahead of us is a theoretically easy job - however I remind you that our first job was supposed to be easy and we had two pirate attacks and an attempted bombing. Our second job was also supposed to be easy, and it ended with the Three-Day-War. So take nothing for granted. Help your squad, do your jobs, we all come home and get paid. Sergeant Major, they're all yours."" So saying, Gryzzk moved casually to the forward hatch and hid himself so he could listen to the stunningly profane words from O'Brien.

""Now that the Major's hiding himself inside the hatch, welcome to reality. You're all here thinking you're gonna get some glorious chance to be a hero and you'll never buy your own drinks again. We don't do hero-work here. We do the dirty, nasty work that doesn't make the holos, because what makes the holos is a Bordeaux clusterfuck. So focus your working brain cell on doing what you're told to do and then when we dock here you can stop at Sparrows and then proceed to do whatever tickles your fancy after paying for your sins. Now off you go."" She threw her head toward the hatches and the company dispersed to their stations.

Gryzzk hurried to the bridge and settled in with his tablet before everyone else could make their way in. As they took their stations, he stood calmly at the command chair.

""Sergeant Reilly, confirm battalion readiness.""

Reilly tossed her freshly-purpled hair and grinned easily. ""All companies report ready.""

""Excellent. Lieutenant Edwards, as you need to become accustomed to command...the chair is yours until we exit Homeplate.""

Edwards blinked and stood, approaching the command chair and settling herself in it while Gryzzk moved to take over her station.

She touched her rank bar for a moment and swallowed. ""Helm, confirm clear of docking clamps and set course three-one-zero mark zero-one-six, ahead slow. I say again, *slow*. Communications, advise Docking Control of course and speed. Signal the companies to match course and speed at their discretion.""

The *Twilight Rose* cleared and moved at a sedate pace, and for once they left without incident. Edwards looked at Gryzzk and gave a slight professional nod - her scent however was one of absolute joy.

""We're clear of Homeplate."" She then rose and took her station. ""Sensors show no issues, cleared to the Eridani jump point.""

Gryzzk smiled. ""Excellent. Captain Hoban, show me the stars around Eridani, please.""

Edwards caught a little elbow from O'Brien. ""So how was your first command, Lieutenant?"" The Sergeant Major had a smirk on her face.

""...Comfortable chair.""

Rosie was herself as she chimed in. ""Good enough with command I almost forgot how fuckin' ugly she is.""

Gryzzk waved a hand. ""XO, contain your enthusiasm and locate Lieutenant Nhoot.""

""She is currently talking the Pavonians ears off while she gives them a 'proper' tour of the ship.""

""Excellent."" Gryzzk then turned to his next task. ""Sergeant Reilly?""

Reilly immediately became wary as she swiveled her chair - it almost seemed her olfactory sense had improved, or she had pattern recognition developed over a lifetime of mischief in the face of authority. ""Yessir?""

""I have a special task for you once we hit R-space. I have a question that requires diligence and attention to detail in order to answer. How many hairs make up Ensign Jonesy's coat? I expect an answer before we leave R-space; you may use your hands only for this task.""

Reilly made a face of feigned surprise. ""Fer-what?!""

""Sergeant I have a list, would you care to hear it in alphabetical or chronological order?""

Reilly's shoulders slumped in defeat. ""Alright.""

""Now then..."" Gryzzk slotted the data-tab he'd received and lifted an eyebrow slightly. ""Reilly, delay my previous task for you - signal the battalion for immediate conference availability. We have to make a plan, and the necessary implementation drills will require your presence. When you go to bed tonight don't forget to tell the light gods thank you.""

Reilly leaned back and nodded her thanks before singing softly under her breath - the translator didn't fully scan, so Gryzzk made a mental note to check with Rosie regarding the phrase ""I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.""",3,1766764849.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

You always liked when I wrote lengthy diary entries about our dates and would demand to read each and every one, all thirty thousand words of them. I hope that, somehow, you will enjoy reading this too.

Do you remember how we met? It was 2018 and we were in the same Japanese class. I did a presentation on my favourite anime, Love Live. You happened to be a massive fan, got audibly excited when μ's appeared on screen, and texted me afterwards. I was really happy then. A fellow weeb! We shared so many interests and geeked out all day about them. You were the one who convinced me to try out Infinity Nikki through your regular fit checks. I pulled you into Project Sekai because of Mizu5. Well, back into it, more precisely. You got me into Milgram and Alien Stage, though you never quite won me over on ParaLive or Honkai Star Rail. I dropped Umamusume and horse-racing lore on you while you listened patiently; Gold Ship, Silence Suzuka, Haru Urara. Our social media feeds grew so similar, just as our lives grew more entwined.

Oh, and how could I neglect all the mundane stuff we shared! The random cats and dogs we saw. The mildly funny TikTok clips and Tumblr posts. The complaints about our day. The daily good morning and good night gifs, the ugliest ones PicMix had to offer. The reminders to eat a meal and drink up. Maybe I’m just a massive introvert, but there was no one else who I talked to like this. To whom I could yap about absolutely anything, no matter how irrelevant.

And when I finally worked up the courage to tell you my most closely-guarded secrets, you accepted me in my entirety. You became my closest confidant.

I let slip that I had a crush on you around the start of 2025, but it wasn’t until July that you first held my chin in your palm and we started our complicated relationship. You said you were traumatised from your past relationships — that you feared commitment and weren’t sure how to love anyone anymore. I accepted that and said we should take things at your pace. We never were ‘officially’ anything, but we were a couple. We were never exclusive, but you knew my heart was solely with you and you told me you didn’t need anyone else when you had me. We never flaunted anything online, but we unabashedly held hands and clung to each other when we were together on campus and in public. You walked by my side for hours until both our calves were sore, always remembering to stay on my left so I could hear your voice clearly through my better ear. Even without the fixed labels and formal commitments, I was happy. I thought you were too.

In the middle of November you told me you had a crush on someone else. That you two had been talking for a while, even flirting, but that you were getting over him. “dont u worry”, you wrote. I didn’t worry. I trusted you.

Later that evening, I poured out my heart to you about my recent family and financial issues. My brother’s escalating physical violence, my father’s steadily collapsing business, my mother’s exhausted helpless inaction. I was at my lowest, and you were there for me. Hugs, kisses, pet names. You said that you would help me in any way you could. You said that you would check in more. You said that it would all be okay.

The next morning, you wrote to me about how much you wanted me. I never had the chance to reply.

Three hours later, you texted me that you and your crush were official. That abrupt announcement was also our break-up message. You ended it with a sticker of Nailong in a swimsuit, grinning cheekily at me. Should I have laughed?

I congratulated you and wished you luck with your boyfriend. Perhaps in that moment I should have blocked you and moved on. And yet, we continued to talk.

A week in, you confided in me about how your physical and mental health were spiralling because of him. Depression, panic attacks, restless nights. How you cried yourself to sleep, suffered nightmares about your relationship, and woke up crying again. How you had to resort to coffee to get through your exams, even though you’d sworn off it long ago because caffeine irritates your intestines. You fawned over how he acted like a gentleman and treated you like a princess. You sought advice on how to address his pornography habit and misogynist attitudes. You gushed about his long hair, his long fingers. You despaired over your irreconcilable differences in morality and worldview; incompatibilities you had long known about but chose to turn a blind eye to. Through it all, I tried my hardest to be your friend and counsellor, swallowing my suffering and numbing my pain to support you no matter what. I *wanted* you to find your lasting happiness, even if it had to be by someone else’s side.

But maybe I told you too much of what you wanted to hear and too little of what you needed. One core value, one firm conviction, one dealbreaker at a time, you caved and you compromised and you ripped yourself apart to become more acceptable to someone you’d known for a *month*. Once, you had dumped an ex-boyfriend because he wouldn’t stand up for you. Now, you wouldn’t even stand up for *yourself*. I watched as you gave up everything we had, everything *you* were for *him ——*

and you weren’t even happy.

The two of you ended things last Tuesday. Three hearts broken in as many weeks. It was your shortest ever relationship.

Tell me, was it worth it? Was it novel? Was it fun? Was it exciting that every time he checked in on you, you got so anxious that you “wanted to stab” yourself? Was it thrilling that when he said “I love you”, you couldn’t bring yourself to say it back because you didn’t love him “yet”? Was it comforting to know you could never get to know his friends and community because their beliefs are intolerable“lies” to you, and yours to them? Were those butterflies — when you managed to “forget” about the parts of him you couldn’t stomach — worth your sadness and dread, wordlessly sobbing into your pillow at three in the morning on the day of your finals?

Was it worth casting aside the times we would open up to one another about our insecurities and struggles with family, health, studies, appearance, love, life? Was it worth the nights we spent chatting about nothing and everything, when I would remind you to take your medication at midnight sharp, using scheduled messages when I had to call it a day early? Was it worth the hours we embraced tightly and found peace in each other’s warmth? The late-night conversations, the curated playlists, the exchanged reels, the spilled tea, the puzzle solving, the inane in-jokes, the mala lunches, the aimless walks, mall exploration, retail therapy, coordinated clothes, study sessions, gaming evenings, co-op farming, gacha dailies, head pats neck massages lap pillows huggy naps otaku fangirling cosplay plans convention trips jewellery hunting yarn shopping handmadegiftscuddlyskinshipsacrificedsleepsharedsecrets…

Did you cherish any of these memories we created together? Or did it simply please you to be the ruler of my heart?

We met up three days after your break-up because you wanted me to console you. It was exactly one month since you dumped me, but it was evident that the date had no significance to you. I lent you an ear and a shoulder. You said you felt calmer. But after that, over text, I told you how much I missed you and wanted us to go back to what we had before. I know, it was stupidly rushed. Stupid in general, perhaps. First you told me to move on, then that you needed space. Eventually you said that we shouldn’t talk ever again. I just couldn’t stop myself from typing. I had so much to say and so much more I wanted to hear from you. Answers. Assurances that there was some reasonable explanation for why you had dropped me like a sack of potatoes, but still kept me close to you. Affirmations that you were still the caring friend I’d always known.

But I should’ve listened to you and stopped. Foolish and disrespectful of me, wasn’t it? I won’t sugarcoat it. I fucked up. I was hurt, but I hurt you back. I’m sorry I did such a shoddy job of supporting you when you needed me most. But I can only regret that these were not the words I said to you then.

You never replied. You silently blocked me.

Our clumsy relationship was one thing. It’s been tough, but I’ve come to terms with its end. What I grieve is our friendship. We exchanged tens of thousands of texts over WhatsApp, well into the six digits. We spent hours calling on Discord and recorded audio clips for each other to play on repeat. We talked daily, as if keeping up a streak that neither of us were counting, for who knows how long. We used to daydream about running away, from home, from this country, to somewhere we could freely be ourselves. When I passed my driving test in October, my first thought had been about how we could finally go on a road trip to that happy place and cruise off into the sunset. Now you’ve run so far away from even me.

I don’t want this to be our goodbye. Maybe I still hope you’ll reach out. I still bring around that Mizuki keychain you crocheted for my birthday. I still use that concealer you bought in a panic after nibbling my neck too hard. If I waited for a week, or a month, or a semester, would you be willing to talk like we used to? Would we squeeze onto the bench of a grand piano and duet Cendrillon or Shoujo Rei again? I don’t know. I really can’t predict you anymore. You were always fickle. Even so, I thought I knew you thoroughly enough: but it’s been surprises upon surprises ever since that day in November when my world began to crumble. I’d put so much trust in you. Gone.

It is as if I had dreamed that we were dear to each other; then I woke up, and we were strangers.

Yet somehow, I still can’t curse your name or wish for you to suffer. I care for you too much to say such careless things. No, the only sentences I can bring forth from my lips are questions, cried out to this endless sky, knowing you may never again listen for my voice:

“Where are you now? What are you doing? Are you smiling like you used to? That is all I hope for right now.”

I went to pay and the tablet still defaulted to 20% tip.

No service yet. No waiters. Just an iPad staring at me while the cashier watched. 

I didn’t tip, and immediately felt awkward, which is the whole point.

What bothers me isn’t tipping itself. I do tip and do it quite often. I support tipping culture but when it’s a genuine reflection of gratitude. I hate how it’s quietly turned into a substitute for wages, pushed onto customers in situations where tipping never existed before. Coffee shops, takeout counters, self-checkout kiosks, merch tables. Everywhere except the place it belongs, the employer’s payroll.

Prices are already higher. Portions are smaller. Fees are everywhere. And now the final screen asks you to personally decide whether the worker gets paid decently, even though you didn’t set their wage, their schedule, or their benefits.

If a business can’t pay staff without relying on customers to tip, they should really reconsider their business.

I’ll tip for actual service. I’ll tip well.

But I’m done pretending a touchscreen deserves 20% for handing me a bag.

If tipping is mandatory, just raise the price and be honest. If it’s optional, stop making people feel like jerks for saying no.",2,1766764711.0,AmericaOnHardMode,0,1.0,False

I would like to comment on a few of the more obvious things. There are fundamental things that the women are missing too but I will leave that to a woman to address.

I feel justified in sharing these observations because I have navigated, with more than a little success, the process of starting and maintaining secret loving relationships with married women not married to me for more than forty years. 

While there are a million ways to go about it, these are the things that I have learned by sometimes joyful and sometimes painful experience:

* Make your time together special - It is more than likely that you are able to be with her because she is being ignored and taken advantage by her husband. In being with you, she is risking a lot. Make it worth her efforts by creating a space and a world that is the opposite of her home life, not a variation of the same.
* Always bring a little gift when you meet - What to bring will depend on her. Chocolate, bourbon, a knick-knack, a flower. Something consumable or explainable should her husband see it.
* Get a room -  Folding the seats down in the minivan and parking behind the Wal-Mart or at the nearest rest stop on the interstate ain't gonna cut it. Neither is a room in a place that has a number or a color in the name. If you can't afford this or figure out how to do so clandestinely, you should wait until you are able to do so before playing in this sandbox.
* Hygiene - When you are going to be together, shower, wash your hair (if you have any), shave, trim your nails, trim your body hair, wear deodorant, floss and brush your teeth, avoid coffee and stinky foods, put on freshly laundered clothes and scrub your nether regions. Nothing will dry her up faster than a whiff of BO, stinky balls or stinky ass. If any of this is a problem for you or will clue your wife that something is going on, perhaps the DB might not be entirely your wife's fault.
* Pleasure her first - She is with you because hubby is not taking care of her. I know, your wife is not paying attention to you either but someone has to cum first and patience with this on your part will be richly rewarded. 
* Take the time and take your time - Especially at the beginning of a relationship, don't meet unless it can be for 2 or 3 hours. You both have been sexually starving or living on fast food. Make your time together a feast. You took off work and she shaved her legs. A peck on the cheek and 43 seconds of really intense love making is not worth that level of effort.
* Love is in the air, stay grounded - You are doing the thing that people in love do. You are doing it without all the extra baggage that people sharing life have to carry. Unless you or she are a psychopath or a sociopath, feelings of affection and love are going to arise. Keep them in their place. You are in a land of make believe. She will not appreciate your farting in bed anymore than your wife does and you will not appreciate her snoring any more than your wife's. The fact that it is a make believe world is what makes it work. If you try to make it something more, 99 times out of 100 you will fuck it up and a whole lot more.

There is a lot of joy and fulfillment to be had with treating each other in the special way you are not being treated at home. All relationships are a give and take thing. You have to give what is needed in order to take what you need.

I am sure that I am in for a beating by the Karmic army of cheated-on down voters. ",13,1766764622.0,adultery,5,0.88,False

I hope you have had a wonderful Chrismahanukwanzakah this year! There were plenty of 'feats of strengths' and 'airing of grievances' over here. I also can't believe there are only a couple more days left in 2025. What the hell happened to the year???

OK, down to business... This week I made one more minor improvement to the report. Now the ""Location"" column contains an extra link you can tap/click. If I did it correctly, these links *should* open up the business on Google Maps. This is something I've always wanted in the past so I can see where the business is located and what recent reviews look like in a single tap/click. Hopefully it works!

I'm hoping all of you have had a wonderful holiday season so far. Are you guys are ready for 2026 yet? HERE WE COME!

__Happy New Year__! 🍻

## Worst Scores

These are all the places that scored worse than 85. Similar to the previous Rotten Restaurant Report format, I don’t include scores between 85 and 99 since these are typically just minor misses in an inspection and likely not worth worrying about.

I believe love is built in the little things: laughing so hard you snort, holding hands on late-night walks like you’re in a movie montage, and splitting dessert while aggressively insisting we are “done eating” (we are not).

**About me, your potential love interest / emotional support human:**

• Food is my love language. I cook, I eat, I will plan dates around meals, and I *will* ask what you’re thinking about while chewing.  
• I love stories - books, anime, games, travel - if it has lore, I’m in. If it has *world-building*, I’m emotionally invested.  
• I collect physical media because the apocalypse can take many things, but it will not take my Blu-rays.  
• I’m laid-back, affectionate, mildly goofy, and emotionally available (yes, really).

**What I’m hoping for:**  
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something real - ideally with laughter, mutual hype, and a shared blanket during rainy afternoons. I want stargazing nights, lazy mornings with coffee, and spontaneous adventures that start with “we’ll just go for a bit” and end three hours later.

Bonus points if:  
• You enjoy bad puns  
• You will laugh *with* me when my baking experiments go wrong  
• You understand that “one episode” is a lie we tell ourselves

If this made you smile, message me your favorite comfort food or the last dumb thing that made you laugh way too hard. Worst case scenario: we chat. Best case: this is the start of a very cute story.",1,1766764339.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,2,1.0,False

enneagram quationarie

• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

I am 19 years old. I am transmasc, but also use the labels genderqueer and genderfluid interchangeably. I work in a coffee shop, and my favorite part is talking to all the customers, and recommending drinks and food for them to try. I also really enjoy when i get to make drinks, because i can focus on one thing and go on autopilot. I love seeing satisfied looks on peoples faces when they really enjoy their coffee. if feels good to feel like i'm giving back. I live with 2 of my best friends, and we are roommates. i've been kind of sad recently though, because besides my roommates, i don't see a lot of my other friends anymore. 

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

i have been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety. the depression is manageable but has come back due to personal circumstances. a lot of my friends also think i'm autistic but im not too sure.

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

i was raised mostly by my mom. we were lower middle class a majority of my childhood, and it was kind of chaotic. my mom has bpd and i'm her ""favorite person"" which means her mood has depended on my mood a majority of my life, so it was a lot of pressure sometimes. i was not raised religious but my mom shared some spiritual practices with me, and i still follow a lot of them today

• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

i'm a barista like i said, but im planning on perusing music. i write songs, sing and play guitar. it's a matter of putting myself out there. i love my current job but i don't think it will be for forever.

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

i think i might actually have a mental break. i get very lonely very easily. i can spend a day by myself to get things done, but it gets to a point where im super anxious. i get in my head too easily. even when mentally healthy, i am a huge extrovert.

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I love artistic hobbies and activities. i sing, paint, play guitar, and i've acted in the past. i wouldn't say im the best at sports, but im a great dancer (told to me by many people) and i love being active when i can, but lose motivation or don't have enough mental energy a lot of the time. i love nature walks and hikes, they are very grounding. it's nice to see all that the universe has provided the human race with.

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I'd say i'm very curious. i have lots of thoughts and ideas, but often need to write them down to remember them. I'm curious mostly about nature, human and otherwise. i love science, and understanding the world around me is probably where most of my curiosities stem from. besides innate curiosity, i love hearing about other people's interests if i don't already know about them. it's nice to connect with others in that way, and i love sharing information as well.

• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

i don't think so. i'm very good in high stress situations, and i can jump to action quickly during an emergency. i usually crash after that happens though. i wanted to be an emt at one point, but realized mentally it would not be good for me. I think if the time called for it, i could be a great leader, but it might be too stressful. i'm not sure what my leadership style would be though

• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I'd say i'm coordinated, but i used to be verrryyy uncoordinated as a kid. i was probably the clumsiest person i knew. now i think i have a better feel of life and how my body moves. i like working with my hands when im painting and crafting. it's calming i think. it's nice to focus on one thing

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

i am artistic. when it comes to my song writing, i use a lot of metaphors for my feelings and relationships. I like writing about what i've been through, how i see the world, and other people. I have a way of stringing lyrics together that people admire i think. I love singing, and try to ring whenever i can. it's calming, and brings me a feeling that not a lot of other things do. i love performing, and not just singing and playing. when im acting, pretending to be other people, to get into the heads of characters when im acting as, is very enjoyable. when i paint, it represents a feeling or a moment, and i use symbols and objects, people, in a surrealist style. 

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

the past is painful, but has taught me a lot about life and the world. I went through a lot as a child. i think a lot of people think that's just the way life is, but i do think other people have it better or worse based on circumstance. even though i've been through a lot, im grateful for the person i am today. the present is hard, but im glad to be in this world overall. i feel like i haven't gotten to where i want to be at this point in life, but i know it takes time. the future is scary, and im afraid im not going to have enough time with everything and everyone i love, so i try to appreciate everything in my life as much as i can

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

if i'm honest, sometimes i'm frustrated depending on how the favor is asked. if it's an expectation, i get irritated that it is expected of me. if it's a request, im always happy to help. this is something im trying to work on, because i do want to help those around me, but i don't like it when other people have expectations of me for some reason. it's very stressful 

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

i don't know what this means, but i think it means habits and things like that. i definitely need it, but i have a hard time staying on track and sticking to the things in life that seem easy for everyone else. laundry, cleaning up, things like that. sometimes i get into a funk, and i don't realize how bad it is until it's too late.

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

I feel like it is important, but i have a lot of trouble committing to practical things like that in my own home. when i'm out in the world, things running smoothly makes me feel more calm. 

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

i don't think i do. maybe i try to influence people's choices when i feel that what they are doing isn't beneficial to themselves, but im very direct that thats what im doing.

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

i feel like i have already explained a lot about what my hobbies are. i guess i like them because they come naturally, and they feel right for me. i've always been a very creative person, and was in the gifted program my entire school life, so i knew what i was good at and what made me feel complete from a young age

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

i am a hands on learner, and i learn best from watching and then doing. i struggle in learning environments where i have to stay still and quiet. i always have a lot of questions when things are explained to me, and i feel like i never run out. even when i fully understand what im learning, that leads to more questions because my brain makes lots of connections to other things that would seem unrelated. I'm not the best with memorization, unless it's a topic i'm very interested in or if it's muscle memory or i make a song out of it. the rest i think i really enjoy.

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

i almost always wing projects that are my own, but if we are talking about when i was in school, i would need to break it down in really small steps to fully understand it.

• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

i want to be back on the stage, weather through musical theater, or my own music. performing really is my passion, and the satisfaction of a complete project always leaves me wanting more. for my personal life, i just want to make a difference for my community and my loved ones. i want people to understand there is hope and we are all connected. that we aren't humans without each other 

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

i have a lot of fears around dying before i've accomplished everything im meant to do in this life. i'm afraid of losing the people closest to me and them not knowing how much i really love them. closed minded people make me uncomfortable. people who hate the world or get angry with me when i feel i haven't done anything, especially when they don't explain why. i hate when people have high expectations tat are impossible to meet. i hate when people have those expectations but don't contribute to the outcome by communicating. im afraid of death because it's unknown. i'm afraid of my friends dying because i've lost so many people and it's been too much for me. close minded people with high expectations only want things for themselves.

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

when i'm living the most fulfilled. lots of stimulation, always busy. seeing people a lot. my room is clean and organized. i open up to people about my struggles. i'm honest about my feelings

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

not going out. laying in bed a lot. my room is a mess. i cry a lot and people irritate me easily. i hide my feelings at risk of feeling like a burden. i isolate

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

i try my best, but even when im feeling well i am not very grounded. i have a lot of thoughts and i space out. sometimes im not even aware of what's going on around me unless im doing a physical activity. and even then im not super aware of the conversations happening. when i daydream im semi aware it's happening, but sometimes not.

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

i would probably have a panic attack and start to lose touch with reality 

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

i feel like i either take too much time or i jump in really quickly. it depends on the day or situation

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

i try to process them while they are happening, because i feel a lot. emotions are probably my driving factor

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

i used to do this a lot, but i have a better sense of myself than i used to. i don't do this at all anymore and try to be honest with my opinions. when i don't share my opinion that usually means i want the conversation to end

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

i break rules if i feel they don't align to my morales. i would think authority is always right because that's what i was taught, but i've learned through life that a lot of people in power don't use it responsibly. they do it for their own benefit rather than the benefit of the human race.",1,1766764108.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,1.0,False

That used to be me.

Here’s how I spent my holiday this year: Slept in. Drank coffee and had cinnamon rolls in bed with the dog while I did a crossword. Came down to a (mostly) clean house and made deviled eggs because I felt like it. Took the dog for a long leisurely walk. Set soup to simmer on the stove for a few hours while I relaxed and enjoyed some of the gifts I got myself. Talked and messaged with friends. Had wine with dinner and eggnog and cookies for dessert. Cuddled with my dog under a blanket and watched a movie.

This was not my first holiday alone, and every single year. I enjoy it more and more. I feel joy and peace and contentment. When I was married, there were always fights, stress, forced interactions, nothing was ever good enough. Anytime you hear about someone spending Christmas alone it’s portrayed in this really sad, lonely way, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.

Honestly, I'm not sure how this will land, but this random thought just popped into my head the other day, so I figured I'd share it here and see if it resonates with anyone.

I'm in my early 30s, unmarried, working and living in Pune. Lately, I've been reflecting on how this particular life stage can feel a bit strange and isolating at times. Younger crowds (in their 20s) often seem to be at a different level of maturity when it comes to career pressures, financial realities, and long-term life decisions. On the flip side, many people in their late 30s or 40s are already married, settled with family priorities, and focused on different things.

A lot of us around 30-35 appear to be navigating this odd in-between phase: some are unsure about marriage, some are happily content staying single, some are reflecting on past relationships or even divorce thoughts, and others have been actively searching for a partner for years without much success yet. It creates this unique limbo where things can feel unclear or lonely sometimes.

These are the main reasons I've been thinking a casual peer community for folks in this early 30s unmarried stage could be genuinely helpful:

1. Harder to connect across ages — Younger crowds sometimes miss that deeper understanding of adult responsibilities like career stability, finances, and life planning, while older ones are mostly in married/family mode. 

2. Safe space for real talk — A judgment-free zone where people can openly communicate, share personal thoughts, vent, express doubts, or just be themselves without being labeled, misunderstood, or judged.

3. Knowledge & idea exchange — Everyone carries unique pieces of wisdom from their experiences (whether it's work insights, hobbies, life hacks, or random learnings). Exchanging that could help everyone grow, learn something new, and feel more enriched.

4. Battling this confusing phase together — With marriage doubts, firm choices to stay single, post-relationship recovery, or ongoing partner searches, it's a strange zone of uncertainty. Hearing others' perspectives, stories, and journeys might bring a bit more clarity, make decisions feel less overwhelming, and remind us we're not alone in it.

I'm not trying to organize anything big or pushy right now — this is just an idea that's been lingering. But I'd love to hear from others in a similar spot (especially 30-35 unmarried folks in Pune):

- Do you feel this way too? How are you handling the social/peer side of this life stage?

- Have you found good ways to connect with like-minded people (casual hangs, interest-based events, apps like Meetup.com, etc.) without it turning into dating stuff?

- If this kind of low-key peer connection (coffee walks, group discussions on life topics, shared meals) sounds appealing, drop a comment — maybe we can brainstorm simple ways to make it happen organically.

Open to all respectful thoughts, experiences, or suggestions. Let's keep it positive and friendly! 😊

Thanks for reading — curious and looking forward  to see what people say.

I have had this strange problem all my life: I can't attract people with shared interests, abilities and values. I had my share of attention, but it always was from the folks I didn't find interesting myself.

Some examples:

1. While I worked in a vegan cafe, there was a sassy gay guy, with whom I really wanted to be friends. I am bisexual myself, and I thought that same-sex dating experience would help us get closer. We also both did photography and liked fashion. But instead he was always visibly annoyed in my presence and couldn't stop being ironic about everything. He was best friends with a fitness model girl, and she didn't like me either. Instead, I was popular among the rest of the stuff, who were mostly very normal and boring young people and part-time students.
2. A couple of years later I was working at a coffee shop as a barista. There was a really creative young woman, who graduated from an animation program. I was trying to enrol to it at the time myself. There was no tension or a conflict, but she refused to be friendly (even at a basic level), and once, for no reason at all, she said that she hoped that I won't be able to enrol. I assume she was either gatekeeping or genuinely didn't want anything created by me to exist. That was hilariously cruel and uncalled for.
3. Being an artist, I try to network among other creatives. And they always refuse every invitation to any kind of an activity that is not job/business-related. When I try to find out about their social cycle, it often turns out that they don't have any friends from the creative industry themselves. So it seems like they actively avoid people who share the profession with them. While I, myself, have very little interest in people who doesn't do art as a full-time job.

My partner has the same exact problem.

These friendships don't fall apart - they never start to begin with. And the friends we currently have are often very dependant and need to be organised. They feel like a herd - for the lack of the better word. It's a tiring dynamic that drains all of your resources - psychological and material as well.

My only theory is that we look for people with whom we could have an equal dynamic. And most other creatives don't want that - they prefer to get attention from people who they look down at or can manipulate (sometimes literal followers and patrons). I am certainly attracted mostly to narcissists, and I and my partner both have some narcissistic traits ourselves.

A breakdown of our main use cases.,"[POV: When you use Cuneflow AI Notebook](https://preview.redd.it/vv9bhynjik9g1.jpg?width=6224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0c8a1124a490a7497a62df76c045c5dfa3fcf25)

Hi r/cuneflow!

With CES just around the corner (we are flying out in a few days!), we’ve been getting a lot of DMs asking: “Is this device right for my specific workflow?”

We designed [Cuneflow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cuneflow) because we felt stuck between two worlds: the **focus** of paper and the **power** of digital.

So, I wanted to break down exactly who we had in mind when we built this hardware and software. If you fit into one of these buckets, [Cuneflow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cuneflow) was made for you.

# 1. The ""Polite"" Professional (Executives & Managers) 🤝

**The Pain Point:** You spend your day in 1-on-1s or high-stakes client meetings. Opening a laptop creates a physical wall and makes it look like you aren't listening.  
**The Cuneflow Fix:**

* You can maintain eye contact while writing.
* The device records the conversation and links it to your notes.
* You look engaged and respectful, but you still get a perfect AI summary and transcript afterwards.

# 2. The Student & Researcher 🎓

(We’ve seen a lot of interest from students in r/eink, so here is how it fits your semester)  
**The Pain Point:** The professor talks too fast. You spend all your energy panic-copying notes instead of actually understanding the concept. Plus, reading PDFs on an iPad for 4 hours hurts your eyes.  
**The Cuneflow Fix:**

* **Pre-Class:** Upload your lecture slides/PDFs before class. The AI pre-reads them.
* **During Class:** Record the lecture. Don't transcribe everything—just jot down key insights.
* **Review:** Circle a confusing part of your notes, and the AI will play back/summarize just that specific moment of the class.
* **Hardware:** 300ppi non-backlit E-ink means zero eye strain during late-night study sessions.

# 3. The Visual Thinker (Creatives & Designers) 🧠

**The Pain Point:** Keyboards are linear. Your brain is not. You think in arrows, circles, and messy mind maps.  
**The Cuneflow Fix:**

* We use a **Wacom 3rd-Gen Ceramic Nib** to give you real tactile friction.
* Our ""Structure Recognition"" engine turns your messy hand-drawn charts into clean, vector-based digital assets you can actually use in slides later.

# 4. The ""Coffee Shop"" Worker ☕

**The Pain Point:** You want to work from a cafe, but your laptop takes up the whole table and you have to hunt for an outlet.  
**The Cuneflow Fix:**

* It’s **A5 size** and lighter/thinner than an iPad Mini.
* It fits on the smallest table.
* Battery lasts for days, not hours.

**Which one are you?**  
We are looking for our first **50 Co-creators** to help us refine these workflows before our Kickstarter launch.

If you are going to be in Las Vegas next week, come test your specific use case on the hardware at **CES (Venetian Expo, Booth #52712)**.

For everyone else, we are finalizing our **Early Bird list** for the upcoming Kickstarter. If you want to secure the best price, **DM me directly** or drop a comment below, and I’ll get you added.

Originally from Moscow, Russia. I’ve lived in three countries and traveled to thirty. I’m fluent in Russian and English, and some basic French comes back when I spend time in a French-speaking environment.

I have a PhD in Finance and a fulfilling career in the energy sector. Things that bring me joy (in no particular order): good coffee, international travel, symphony and ballet, scotch, the ocean, sleeping in, and tasting menus.

I don’t want kids or pets, but I *do* want intimacy, partnership, and a life built on mutual respect, kindness, and a sense of adventure. I value emotional intelligence, independence, curiosity, and people who are intentional about how they live.

# What I’m looking for

A meaningful, monogamous connection with someone self-aware, kind, and genuinely interested in building a committed life together.

I’m not looking for anything casual, and I’m not interested in pen pals or endless chatting with no intention of meeting. I value depth, follow-through, and people who know what they’re looking for.

# A few important notes to make sure we’re aligned

To save both of us time, here are a few non-negotiables for me:

* **Age range:** late 20s to early 50s. I’m looking for someone old enough for long-term decision-making and not too close to my dad’s age.
* **No pets.** I’m allergic and also strongly prefer a home environment without animals. I know this isn’t everyone’s preference, but it’s a hard boundary for me.
* **Education.** At least an undergraduate degree. Bonus points if you’re a fellow PhD.
* **Career & stability.** I’m looking for someone financially independent and established in their career. Long-distance is a realistic possibility, so stability matters.
* **Messages.** Please include a short bio when reaching out so I have a sense of who you are. I will ask for a recent photo of you once we start chatting. I will only respond to thoughtful, respectful messages.",33,1766763159.0,cf4cf,9,0.92,False

Asking this because a lot of people like a bigger space with more seating but the cost would be costly (which is why coffee shops tend to be in a smaller space and have less seating). 

So if a cafe provided that, would people be willing to support the business if they were to put a small fee to stay?

Me (28F) and my boyfriend (31M) are in a long-distance relationship, and we met in a country that’s neither his nor mine a few weeks ago. Everything seemed great at first, but recently there have been a lot of arguments, and it's stressing me out. I love him, and I do care about him, but I'm not sure how to handle all of this.

Here’s a quick rundown of some of the arguments:

1. First Argument: I found out he had been messaging my ex-friend on his phone. He apologized and admitted it was a mistake, and I needed some time to heal from what felt like a betrayal.

2. Second Argument: He invited me to a breakfast place (more like a casual coffee shop), and I ordered bruschetta and a salad. The next day, he pointed out that I had no manners for ordering so much food, even though I didn’t know the budget. No one told me what the limit was, and the place wasn’t fancy (dishes starting around $10).

3. Third Argument: We went to a store to buy tape for neon lights. I asked if we could buy two in case one didn’t work. He offered a single tape and didn’t mention that the second one was out of budget. I went to the cashier by myself because my card was missing and I didn’t have the keys (we came together). It caused a bit of a drama, and he left to get ice cream, while I waited in the store.

4. Fourth Argument: He asked me for my opinion on a story he was reading, but I wasn’t impressed and didn’t know the people involved, so I said, ""I don’t know these people or their story."" He yelled at me, saying I didn’t care and it seemed like our situation. I told him it wasn’t our story—people are different. As a result, we slept in separate beds that night because he didn’t like my response.

5. Fifth Argument: At a Christmas party, he started touching my face. I told him not to, and he went on Instagram. I found that weird at the party, and I called him “addictive” because he always goes on Instagram no matter what’s happening around us.

6. Sixth Argument: The next day, I baked a pie and suggested watching movies together. After the movie ended, I checked my phone for messages from family. He started copying me and said, “Ew, again? You’re on Instagram?” He got upset and started blaming me for everything I mentioned in the post. He said my attitude was wrong, that he was wasting his time, and called me ""pathetic.""

Now, it feels like he’s looking for conflicts to end the relationship, but maybe he’s just afraid to confront me directly.

What should I say or do to make things better? How can I approach these conversations without things escalating? I really care about him, but I don’t know how much more of this constant drama I can handle.",2,1766763051.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

We’ve been together for a year and a half. In another year, I plan on moving to his country. It’s a mutual decision. I’m in America and work in research, which has been very defunded so I can’t find a good job, but I will make over 6 figures where he is. 

Last night (Christmas) my mom was asking if I’ll spend Christmas with them next year. I said yes, it should be right before I move. She was asking what I was going to do with my stuff, and I said probably sell my big furniture and put the rest in storage. She said “well, don’t sell your stuff, you’ll only be there a year.” I said, “no mom, it’ll be 3-5 years before I move back. I have already told you guys that.” And she freaked out. Started yelling that I’m choosing a guy over my family, I’ve ruined Christmas, why would I talk to her about that on Christmas. I’m really stumped because I’ve been very vocal about my plans. She said I’ll be keeping future grandkids from her, but I don’t even know if I want kids. She accused him of trying to isolate me and said “don’t ever tell me you don’t like your friend’s partner again, when you’re choosing yours over this family.” (For context; friend’s partner told me that as a woman I shouldn’t work in science, if I don’t have kids I’m a failure, etc.) Also, until this point she has loved my partner and always tells me she can’t wait until we’re married. 

I did also tell her this is a tentative plan, hoping that our relationship is still solid. It’s in a year, so anything could happen between now and then. The move is also my idea for my career, which she knows. It’s not too far from here, like a 4 hour direct flight. 

She has outbursts like this frequently, and I’m always the one to apologize. But I’m tired of it. My siblings said take her for nice coffee and apologize. My dad said she needs to get over it. But she hasn’t spoken with me since that conversation yesterday. I’m going back to the city I live in on Tuesday, so I’m still here for another 5 days or so. ",1,1766763011.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

(I was distracted by kitchen chaos.) Huh, that's strange: the bloom is not producing much CO2, and the grounds seem darker than usual. I didn't realize what was happening until I was into my spiral pour and the drip was noticeably slow! When I finally realized what was going on, I closed the switch and finished the pour. I was impatient so I didn't let it steep that long, maybe 60 seconds. The release was very slow! I set it aside in a covered mug in the fridge and made a proper cup.  
This morning with some hesitation I sampled the cold coffee and to my surprise it was not bad. Weak of course but still flavorful. Very little contact after all, but ground finer that typical for traditional cold brew. Would I recommend this technique to make cold brew: no, of course not! If you're using a V60 you might as well make hot coffee and then cool it in the fridge, you'll get more tasty cold coffee (albeit with more bitterness than cold brew). But the point is: I was surprised that I get as much extraction as I did. (No, I didn't measure the TDS.)

He is my first sugar daddy I’ve never had one and I met him through a friend of mine who was his sugar bat before but now is married and fully grew out of it so she put me in contact when I asked her about him.  

Since it was close to Christmas and I had met him in person a few times just for coffee or lunch I didn’t get much thought he was just really nice and my friend was just lying about being spoiled by him but when I was at his house Christmas Eve. All I see is a bunch of presents labeled Annabelle, and I was like holy crap I only bought him one gift and it was a nice shirt that I’d like to see him wear to dinner lol. 

But anyways I was asked to sign a contract to become his submissive freeuse sugar baby in return he’d let me buy whatever I want whenever i wanted he’s now paying me for my phone bill and monthly car insurance. 

Then we have an amazing long Christmas Eve with lots of sex bondage and just showing how dominant he can be and I loved it. He also looks just like Christian grey from fifty shades of grey like pretty spot on doppelgänger. 

And then it’s Christmas morning he makes me pancakes bacon and eggs and tea cause he remembered I don’t like coffee but love apple cinnamon tea and he’s just wearing plaid pj bottoms and a t shirt and I’m wearing a red/pinkish satin pj set and then we get to opening gifts. First was my stocking which was a few lottery tickets chocolates and a few random skincare and beauty products. 

Then he has me open my gifts and I opened ten pairs of lululemon leggings, with matching bras, and two pairs of there shoes. Which was over $2000 

Then as I’m opening them he has me try them on one by one do a little spin and give him a kiss on the cheek. 

Then I get into a few other boxes and he bought me 5 dresses to pick for New Year’s Eve and then three pairs of red sole high heels and he bought me my favourite dream pair which is the hot chick 120mm from Christian louboutin 

He bought me every colour. That is over $4000 in heels  and the dresses everything still had the price tags on them and they added up to about $3000 beautiful skin tight floor length dark purple and black dress, an emerald green open back knee high satin lose fitting dress, a sparkling gold mini dress, and a navy blue bubble dress. And a white simple dress. 

However after trying all of these on Jake says he has one more gift to open and it’s like the cherry on top he hands me a small box and I open it to find a diamond pendant necklace and my own keys to his house. 

Price of the necklace was $3650 at a 2carat diamond. I was like holy fucken shit it’s huge and he puts it on me and is just very sweet and nice looking. 

Then we just go about our morning I go shower he cleans up the kitchen and then he takes me to the a spa to relax and get a nice full body massage and had a whole day planned at the therma spa near his house and it was beautiful. ",0,1766762699.0,confessions,3,0.25,False

I just received my GaggiMate Pro kit and can't wait to start the installation!

Typically my gf and I prefer single shots over double shots, as we like to drink multiple coffees during the day without getting a caffeine overdose. We often don't drink coffee together, so splitting a double shot is not an option.

Now, any help with the following questions would be highly appreciated..!

1. How compatible is GaggiMate with single shots?
2. What single shot basket would you recommend?

I found online that most people recommend one of the following single shot baskets:

* La Marzocco Single Filter Basket 7g
   * Apparently there is an 'old' and 'new' version, and the old one is the one people recommend? I don't know yet how to recognise which version is the old vs. new one.

My name is Hexima, and I am trying to organize a World of Warcraft Guild around players who reside specifically in Toronto, Greater Toronto and Southern Ontario regions.

**Faction: Cross-Faction**  
**Server: TBD / Cross-Realm Friendly**  
**Region: Toronto & Greater Toronto & Southern Ontario** 

YYZ (tentative) is a Toronto-first World of Warcraft guild built for players who want more than a raid log and a loot roll.

We believe guilds are better when names have faces, and when Azeroth occasionally spills into real life. Whether it’s raid night, a pub meetup, a Blizzard watch party, or a casual coffee between pulls, YYZ exists at the intersection of community, shared geography.

You don’t have to be a hardcore raider.  
You don’t have to attend every meetup.  
You just have to want a guild that actually feels like one.

Who We’re Looking For

* WoW players based in the Greater Toronto & Southern Ontario regions.
* Players looking for a close-knit community.
* Adventurers, Raiders, Mythic+ runners, PvPers, socials, and lurkers alike.
* People who want WoW to be part of a larger, shared experience.

I am currently looking for individuals who want to lead, build out our framework and organization, and from there we can develop the brand, naming and more visual esthetics.

I will be going on a trip to Italy for my honeymoon in May, which I’m very excited about. I’m looking forward to returning to Florence especially, because it’s a beautiful city and I wasn’t able to spend much time there when I went over a decade ago…But to say I wasn’t nervous is an understatement. 

Last time I was in Florence, I was walking down a street near the Duomo around 11am when someone attacked me with an umbrella and groped me repeatedly. I told him to stop and he just laughed at me and I was begging the people around me to help, but they just seemed annoyed. I ran into a scarf shop and the woman working there told me to leave. I told the man I would call the police, and he laughed and said to go ahead because they wouldn’t care. I was then able to cut through a coffee shop to the Piazza della Signoria and found my friend group. 

This happening in the middle of the day, with absolutely no one willing to help, was terrifying. I’ve tried to not let it colour my view of the Florentine people, but it has. Was that a fluke, or do people generally tend to mind their business even when they witness an attack? And also, are the police there really that useless? I was scared to make a report at the time. 

I appreciate any clarity or advice. I get a knot in my stomach when I think about going to Florence again, but I do love everything else about the city. ",0,1766762128.0,florence,10,0.44,False

For me it was different, this flat gave me friends who turned random evenings into coffee breaks, shared snacks, half-sleep conversations and laughter sessions that made the holidays feel less heavy.

No big Christmas plans, no going out in this cold weather.  
Just people who showed up, sat on the floor, checked in, and made this place feel a little like home.

Sometimes you don't find peace in a place but in people who surround you with warmth and love in a place that far away from home.

1pw6hae,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1pw6hae/how_to_configure_cisco_anyconnect_vpn_client/,How to Configure Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client,"Cisco AnyConnect (now called **Cisco Secure Client** from version 5.0 onwards) is a widely-used VPN client that provides secure remote access to corporate networks. Whether you're working from home or connecting from a coffee shop, properly configuring AnyConnect ensures you can access your organization's resources safely and reliably.

This guide covers client-side configuration for end users. If you're an IT administrator looking to set up the VPN server infrastructure, you'll need Cisco's enterprise documentation for ASA or FTD configuration.

# What You'll Need Before Starting

Before you begin configuring AnyConnect, gather the following information from your IT department or network administrator:

# Required Information

* **VPN Server Address**: The URL or IP address of your organization's VPN gateway (e.g., vpn.company.com)
* **Authentication Credentials**: Your username and password (or certificate, depending on your organization's setup)
* **Connection Profile Name**: Some organizations use multiple connection profiles (e.g., ""Employee Access"" vs ""Contractor Access"")
* **Additional Authentication**: Two-factor authentication codes if required

# System Requirements

**Windows:**

* Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit recommended)
* Administrator privileges for initial installation
* Minimum 2 GB RAM
* 100 MB free disk space

**macOS:**

* macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later
* Administrator privileges for installation
* Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and Intel processors supported

**Linux:**

* Ubuntu, Red Hat, or compatible distributions
* Superuser privileges required
* libstdc++ version 3.4 or higher

**Mobile:**

* iOS 14 or later / Android 8 or later
* Available as free download from App Store or Google Play

# Method 1: Web Launch Installation (Recommended for Most Users)

Web launch is the simplest method and automatically configures your VPN connection. This is the preferred approach for most end users.

# Step-by-Step Web Launch Setup

**Step 1: Access Your VPN Portal**

Open your web browser and navigate to your organization's VPN address. This typically looks like:

* [`https://vpn.yourcompany.com`](https://vpn.yourcompany.com)
* [`https://ssl-vpn.yourcompany.com`](https://ssl-vpn.yourcompany.com)
* [`https://remoteaccess.yourcompany.com`](https://remoteaccess.yourcompany.com)

**Step 2: Accept Security Certificate**

Your browser may display a security warning about the SSL certificate. If this is your organization's official VPN portal, click ""Advanced"" and proceed to the website. Contact your IT department if you're unsure.

**Step 3: Log In**

Enter your username and password on the login page. If your organization uses two-factor authentication, enter your verification code when prompted.

**Step 4: Download the Client**

After authentication, you'll see a ""Start AnyConnect"" or ""Start Cisco Secure Client"" button. Click it to begin the automatic download and installation process.

**Step 5: Install the Client**

* **Windows**: A small downloader application runs automatically. Click ""Install"" when prompted and grant administrator permissions.
* **Mac**: Download the .dmg file, open it, and follow the installation wizard. Enter your Mac password when requested.
* **Modern Browsers**: Chrome or Edge work best for web launch on Windows 11 ARM64 devices.

**Step 6: First Connection**

After installation, the VPN client connects automatically. You'll see a small lock icon in your system tray (Windows) or menu bar (Mac) indicating your secure connection.

# Advantages of Web Launch

* Automatic configuration of server settings
* Always downloads the correct client version for your OS
* Organization-specific policies applied automatically
* Simplest method for non-technical users

# Method 2: Manual Installation and Configuration

        <ClientInitialization>
            <ServerList>
                <HostEntry>
                    <HostName>Employee VPN</HostName>
                    <HostAddress>vpn.yourcompany.com</HostAddress>
                </HostEntry>
            </ServerList>
        </ClientInitialization>
    </AnyConnectProfile>

**Step 2: Place Profile File**

Save the XML file to:

* **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\Profile`
* **Mac**: `/opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile`
* **Linux**: `/opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile`

**Step 3: Restart AnyConnect**

Close and reopen AnyConnect. Your profile should now appear in the connection dropdown.

# Connecting to Your VPN

# First-Time Connection

**Step 1: Open AnyConnect**

Launch the Cisco AnyConnect / Cisco Secure Client application.

**Step 2: Select Connection Profile**

If you have multiple profiles, select the appropriate one from the dropdown menu.

**Step 3: Click Connect**

Click the ""Connect"" button to initiate the VPN connection.

**Step 4: Enter Credentials**

1. Enter your username
2. Enter your password
3. If using two-factor authentication, enter your verification code
4. Click ""OK"" or ""Connect""

**Step 5: Accept Certificate (If Prompted)**

If you see a security warning about the server certificate, verify it's your organization's certificate and click ""Connect Anyway"" or ""Accept.""

**Step 6: Verify Connection**

A successful connection shows:

* Green checkmark or lock icon in system tray/menu bar
* ""Connected"" status in the AnyConnect window
* Connection statistics (duration, bytes transferred)

# Disconnecting from VPN

**To disconnect:**

1. Click the AnyConnect icon in your system tray (Windows) or menu bar (Mac)
2. Click ""Disconnect"" in the popup window
3. Wait for confirmation that you're disconnected

**Best Practice**: Always disconnect properly rather than forcing the application to close. This ensures clean termination of your VPN session.

# Advanced Configuration Options

# Trusted Network Detection (TND)

Trusted Network Detection automatically connects or disconnects your VPN based on your network location.

**When to Use:**

* Automatically connect when working from home
* Automatically disconnect when at the office

**Configuration**: This setting is controlled by your IT administrator through server-side policies. Contact your IT department to enable TND for your profile.

# Split Tunneling

Split tunneling allows you to choose which traffic goes through the VPN and which uses your regular internet connection.

**Benefits:**

* Better performance for non-work traffic (Netflix, YouTube)
* Reduced load on company VPN servers
* Faster general internet browsing

**Configuration**: Controlled by your organization's VPN policy. If you need split tunneling enabled, submit a request to your IT department.

# Always-On VPN

Always-On automatically establishes a VPN connection whenever your device starts or detects an untrusted network.

**Use Cases:**

* Maximum security for remote workers
* Compliance requirements
* Preventing accidental data exposure on public networks

**Configuration**: Requires server-side policy configuration by IT administrators.

# Start Before Login (Windows)

This feature allows you to connect to the VPN before logging into Windows, useful for domain-joined computers.

**Enabling Start Before Login:**

1. Ensure the ""Start Before Login"" module was installed
2. The VPN login window appears before the Windows login screen
3. Connect to VPN, then log into Windows normally

# Common Issues and Solutions

# Issue 1: Certificate Error - ""Untrusted Server Certificate""

**Symptoms**: Warning message about untrusted or expired certificate

**Solutions**:

* **Short-term**: Click ""Connect Anyway"" if you trust the source
* **Long-term**: Install your organization's root CA certificate
   1. Obtain the .cer or .crt file from IT
   2. Double-click the file
   3. Install to ""Trusted Root Certification Authorities""
   4. Restart AnyConnect

# Issue 2: Cannot Connect to Server

**Symptoms**: ""Connection attempt has timed out"" or ""The VPN client driver encountered an error""

**Solutions**:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure you have basic internet access
2. **Verify server address**: Confirm you're using the correct VPN server URL
3. **Check port 443**: Some networks block HTTPS traffic
   * Try from a different network (mobile hotspot)
   * Contact your ISP if you're blocked
4. **Restart the VPN service**:
   * Windows: Services > Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Agent > Restart
   * Mac: Terminal > `sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cisco.csc.vpnagent.plist` then load it again

# Issue 3: ""User Not Authorized for AnyConnect Client Access""

**Symptoms**: Authentication succeeds but connection is denied

**Causes**:

* Your account isn't authorized for VPN access
* Wrong connection profile selected
* Expired VPN license on server

**Solutions**:

1. Verify with IT that your account has VPN permissions
2. Try a different connection profile if multiple are available
3. Ask IT to check server-side licensing

# Issue 4: Frequent Disconnections

**Symptoms**: VPN drops connection every few minutes

**Solutions**:

1. **Update network drivers**: Outdated WiFi or Ethernet drivers cause instability
2. **Disable IPv6**: Sometimes conflicts with VPN
   * Windows: Network adapter properties > Uncheck IPv6
   * Mac: System Preferences > Network > Advanced > TCP/IP > Configure IPv6: Off
3. **Adjust power settings**: Prevent network adapter from sleeping
4. **Check Keepalive settings**: Contact IT to adjust Dead Peer Detection (DPD) intervals

# Issue 5: Slow Performance While Connected

**Symptoms**: Extremely slow internet speeds on VPN

**Solutions**:

1. **Request split tunneling**: Keep non-work traffic off VPN
2. **Check for packet fragmentation**:
   * Test with ping commands: `ping -l 1500 [server]`
   * If high packet loss, ask IT to reduce MTU settings
3. **Try different VPN protocol**:
   * Disable DTLS if experiencing issues
   * Switch between SSL and IPsec (if available)
4. **Connect to different server**: If your organization has multiple VPN gateways

# Issue 6: ""Cannot Start the Cisco AnyConnect Service""

**Symptoms**: Service fails to launch on Windows

**Solutions**:

1. **Check for conflicting software**:
   * Uninstall other VPN clients (OpenVPN, etc.)
   * Disable Bonjour Service: `net stop ""bonjour service""`
2. **Repair installation**:
   * Control Panel > Programs > Cisco AnyConnect > Repair
3. **Reinstall with admin rights**: Right-click installer > Run as Administrator

1pw6fg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pw6fg1/aa_when_i_dont_drink/,AA when I don’t drink,"
My husband is insisting I go to AA. The catch is - I don’t drink. At all. 

I used to, and admit at times I was a heavy drinker, but I recognized that was unhealthy and cut back, then eventually quit altogether. I grew up in a place where culturally it’s normal to drink daily, but I realized I didn’t like that culture eventually and quit outright with no fanfare. I don’t enjoy drinking, don’t crave a drink, don’t miss it. 

There was an incident right before I quit where I got unintentionally drunk one night and made an ass of myself (I truly didn’t have much to drink and I think it was an interaction with my meds, but I digress). My husband came to me and said my drinking was getting out of hand and I was like, “sure, i can see that, I agree” and I stopped drinking. It wasn’t hard. There is no “struggle.” I don’t feel like I have no control over it, etc. 

The central tenants of AA require you to say your life is unmanageable due to alcohol (it’s not), and that you must submit to a higher power in order to be able to quit (I do not). I’ve attended meetings just to appease him but I honestly do not relate to what people are talking about in terms of cravings, feeling like they had no control, etc. 

My husband is always telling me “you need alcohol abuse treatment and I don’t understand why you won’t seek it.” But I literally DO NOT DRINK. As someone who actually works in mental health, I know that no treatment program would even admit me because I do not drink, use any form of drugs, etc. My literal only vice is coffee 😂

My husband approached me this week and told me if I don’t start doing 12 steps he is divorcing me. I honestly and genuinely don’t get it. Like, I feel like I’m being punked. I can see how if approached me and asked me to quit and I didn’t, or was still sneaking drinks, or was struggling with cravings, etc. I might need it, but I… don’t. I’m having a hard time with submitting to the “steps” when the things they require you to “admit” are just, not applicable. I feel like I’m violating the anonymity of the program by participating in something I don’t relate to or need. It’s been nearly a year since the last time i had a drink and i literally never think about it. 

And I’m sure there will be some people who will be like “you’re in denial,” and I hear that, but I’m telling you - literally everyone else in my life is like “what is he even talking about? You don’t even like drinking.” My husband has a history of exaggerating things and trying to control things. I’ve shared some posts under another screen name that detail these more but i don’t want too much context because yall will just be like “leave him.” 

And sure, a divorce with someone who exaggerates things about me and makes me feel crazy might not be the worst, but I’m so terrified he’s going to exaggerate or lie about me to the courts to try to get full custody of my kid. I hear such horror stories about these things happening

I dunno, I guess I’m asking what would you do? Suck it up and just do a 12 step program to appease him and see if you get something out of it? I just feel like that’s a violation of the ethics of the program, but I also just don’t know that I’m ready to go through a divorce  ",13,1766761711.0,Marriage,62,0.85,False

I've arbitrarily chosen 35 demerits as the cutoff so anyone that gets less than 35 demerits isn't going to make the list.  I don't want to ding a place unless they got at least a couple major violations or a lot of minor ones.

Meanest comments read-outs?

Reading the insane clowns rage tweets?

For Christmas?

Everyones tired. Beyond tired and exhausted, because there’s a note missing in all of this. 

And we don’t need cope. Or faux optimism about politics—politics is is alchemy. But I feel prompted to ask, what are we doing here if we don’t believe in hope?

But how about 12 Days of Good Trouble?

12 gifts of Christmas (good things that happened)?

The best / smartest / funniest / rightest listener comments?

Reading the best RESPONSES to the insane clown on X.

“Why the Epstein docs are GOOD for democracy.”

Dems / democracy workers seem only focus on the problem and never what can be. They’re / were addicted to election work and no cultural hope. I got a goddamn text about the upcoming firehouse primary in Fairfax county ON FRIGGING CHRISTMAS DAY.

I had an incredible Christmas. My brother came home to surprise my dad after 14 years of not being home for Christmas. And not coming home mostly at all.

My m*ga family members even showed up and we all held it together and gave my parents a 50th Christmas to remember.

I somehow pulled off sticking a canoe in our living room thanks to a freebie I found on Facebook, and found bikes for my kids under $100- which was my entire Christmas budget.

These are actual miracles.

So I don’t need lecture about my problem- I’m good. It’s that one hop online after a two day Christmas jamboree and maybe just maybe want to see something fun, optimistic and hopeful. Just once.

Miracles that might be possible. That are becoming possible. Even if we’re stuck w these jerks for 2,4,8 years, whatever. Miracles do happen, and one would think a platform with as many Catholics, lapsed Catholics, Christian’s, Jews, or just decent people could spend one second reflecting in any real way on the miracle that is this country’s resilience.

We make it all real every time we don’t stomp on the car horn in traffic, or let someone take forever in the checkout line. We make it real when we hold the elevator door open, drop that last dollar into the Salvation Army bucket at the grocery, or tip the little we have at the coffee shop. We make it real when we offer something awesome on our local Buy Nothing, or build a Little Free Library, or bravely take our first step out on the protest line. These are the moments that are miracles, and they must be focused on more if we are to “muddle through somehow.”

We find the North Star, seek the crèche, and light the candle once more in these moments- and make hope, peace, and love real every time we do it. That’s the miracle.

We get triads, sure. But doom is always impending. But that’s the point of the entire Christmas story. The presence of an ominous force and yet a light amid the darkness.

We thank them all the time. We honor their work, and our work building this community—which is part of a movement. And I’ll do that again today. Because the work is a miracle in many ways too.

So maybe guys, how about a blooper megacut? What we didn’t see that’s funny, or touching? Mail bag stories that warm the soul? 

Next Christmas, or maybe Easter, Passover, how about we connect the past to the present and offer up why we’re going to beat this. Why evil will not triumph. Why hope reigns supreme. And despite the intensely hard work ahead, we, the People, can be born anew, survive the storm, and rise again. 

I don’t mean to be the grinch myself, but even the grinch story is about finding room that little beating heart, despite all the naughty in the world. Gallows humor serves a purpose, but something I could sip coffee too and send to a few friends might be nice too.

Thank you to all of you on this sub. In the comments. Our incredible mods. And our cherished principles who have devoted their careers, time, lives and livelihoods to giving us all a little hope mixed with honesty. You’ve taken us on a journey with you towards something believed, and not always seen. 

I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas, a blessed holidays. And I hope Tim has a blast with Toulous in NYC.

If you care to comment, maybe drop a bit of goodness in the bucket. We all deserve it.

1pw66tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/EOOD/comments/1pw66tf/the_one_form_of_exercise_i_personally_recommend/,The one form of exercise I personally recommend to anyone is Parkrun,"Parkrun is the best idea to come out of Britain this century.

Basically a Parkrun is a free 5k run that takes place every Saturday morning in a public space such as a park.

Its a *run* not a race. You go at your own pace. You don't have to run, you can walk as slowly as you want.

Its free. You have to register on the Parkrun site to get a barcode which you print out and carry with you to the event as its used to give you a finish time. That's it, there are no hidden costs unless you want to buy some merch.

Its all free because everything is run by volunteers. Parkrun requests that you volunteer once in a while. Volunteering is normally timekeeping or directing people around the course. You get to cheer people taking part and they will thank you as they go by too. There is always a big cheer and round of applause for the volunteers as part of the briefing before the start.

Its a social thing as much as a run / jog / walk. Its amazing how good exercising with a couple of hundred people on a Saturday morning can be. Then there is the cool down, chatting and coffee afterwards too. As its not a race people behave differently. There is very little competitive behaviour, no pushing to the front before the start etc. People chat to random strangers as they take part. The fashion police are highly discouraged, unlike some exercise places like gyms. People taking part might well get muddy running so box fresh Abercrombie and Fascist kit would be a waste anyway.

There are quite a few events that have ""walk and talk"" mental health things as part of the Parkrun too. Nothing ""official"" or run by medical people, just a chance to talk to and listen to fellow sufferers. An opportunity to help someone while they help you. Community basically.

The downside is there will probably be zero facilities. Nowhere to change, shower, securely store valuables etc. Turn up ready to go and put your phone in a pocket. Better yet leave it at home.

Some elite sportsmen and sportswomen like to be a part of Parkrun too. They generally don't vanish into the distance. Its a community thing for them too. A chance for the to give back a little.

So what have you go to lose? A quick google will find you a local Parkrun in the UK. They are rapidly spreading across the rest of the world too.

See you at 9am on Saturday morning... don't be late ;-)

My wife and I (both 30) are planning a move to the Austin area and would love some local insight. We have a 6-month-old son and a small maltipoo, and we’re coming from **Chicago** — mainly to escape the cold and because we both work fully remote, so we have flexibility on *where* we land.

We’re totally fine driving and are open to being **30–45 minutes outside of Austin**, as long as we’re in a good, family-oriented community. We don’t need to be close to downtown ATX, but we’d still like to be near **restaurants, local coffee shops, parks, and everyday conveniences** (even if it’s a short drive).

Right now we’re looking closely at **Santa Rita Ranch**, **Parmer Ranch**, and possibly somewhere in the **Georgetown** area, and we really like the newer-build, master-planned community vibe (and the fact that you get a lot of square footage for the price). We’re planning to tour homes in those areas in **January** and have been looking at builders like **Westin Homes** and **Perry Homes**, but would love any feedback on those builders — or recommendations for other builders or specific neighborhoods/subdivisions we should check out while we’re there.

**What we’re prioritizing:**  
• Family-friendly, safe community with other young families  
• **Good schools / strong school districts (important long-term)**  
• **Community amenities like pools, gyms/fitness centers, pickleball courts, etc.**  
• Parks, trails, and outdoor spaces  
• Dog-friendly areas with good walking paths  
• Newer construction preferred  
• Nearby coffee shops and restaurants (love local spots)  
• Okay driving for errands / dining / activities

Since we’re moving from Chicago and can pretty much live anywhere around Austin, we’re trying to narrow down areas that are genuinely great places to raise a family long-term.

Would love to hear:  
• Pros/cons of **Santa Rita Ranch** or **Parmer Ranch**

• Builder feedback (good or bad)

# Your Coffee Bar: The Heartbeat of Any Space

We often view a coffee bar as a mere pit stop for a daily caffeine jolt, a functional necessity to power through tasks. However, its true potential far surpasses a simple transactional exchange, offering far more than just a beverage.

A thoughtfully designed coffee bar transforms an ordinary area into a dynamic hub for interaction and rejuvenation. It's where colleagues share quick updates, friends catch up, or individuals simply find a moment of peace away from their main activities. This dedicated space cultivates a sense of hospitality and care, fostering impromptu discussions that often spark innovative ideas. It becomes a subtle yet powerful catalyst for building community and enhancing overall well-being, whether nestled in a bustling office, a welcoming retail store, or the comfort of your own home.

*   **Fosters Connection:** Provides a natural, relaxed setting for spontaneous conversations and networking, strengthening relationships among team members or guests. It’s a low-pressure environment where valuable informal exchanges thrive, breaking down communication barriers and fostering a stronger sense of belonging.
*   **Elevates Experience:** Signals a commitment to comfort and quality, enhancing the perceived value of your environment. Offering a variety of choices and a pleasant aesthetic makes a positive, lasting impression on visitors and regular users alike, encouraging repeat engagement.
*   **Boosts Productivity & Mood:** Encourages vital short breaks, allowing individuals to step away, reset, and return to their work or activities feeling refreshed and focused. A well-deserved coffee moment can significantly improve concentration, creativity, and reduce stress throughout the day.

Ready to transform your space into a vibrant hub of connection and productivity?

1pw64em,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pw64em/i_found_a_diary_in_the_woods_can_someone_please/,"I Found A Diary In The Woods, Can Someone Please Help Me?","I used to enjoy camping. Going outside and being amongst nature was a true pleasure, something that I would do most weekends, come rain or shine. I no longer want to do this. Not anymore. I've tried to think, theorise even, about what I have been through. Something rational, something real to this experience. I just can't. I'm hoping that writing this down might help? Help me process this shit, or at least try to.

It happened on Saturday, which was two days ago. I had gotten up early, hoping to make a quick head start so I would have the rest of the day to do what I wanted. I had planned this weekend for a couple of weeks now, and finally I had a long weekend to enjoy myself. I wasn't needed at work on Monday, so it allowed me to spend the next couple of days camping in my local woodland, Tingrass Woods. Tingrass is relatively small, being only about 15 hectares, but its beauty is unlimited. Shimmering streams and endless oak trees are some of the more dazzling features in there, however, I personally believed that the old mines surrounding the woods were the spotlights.

Tingrass, like its namesake, used to have tin mining in the area. Tin was the town's livelyhood, and was used often for ""revolutionary"" tin cans. The majority of men worked down there in those caverns, and nearly everyone who lives in the town today had at least one person in their family tree who mined tin.

However, on the 4th of December 1966, the Shear shaft collapsed and around 20 men were trapped under the roof of the cave that day. The Shear mineshaft was well-known as the cave with the most amount of tin hiding within it, and so, they mined there the most. It was thought they hit a supporter beam, and because of the cavern's weakened state, the entire ceiling fell. The state spent a month trying to get them out, but it was no use. The boulders were too big, and there wasn't much to do anything about it. At least not in those days. My grandfather was caught in the devestation, and in the end, my father was left with his mother and his two younger sisters.

They're mostly blocked off nowadays, and it's extremely difficult to even reach the entrances due to the rangers patrolling the area all day and night, looking for rambunctious kids wanting somewhere to get wasted or already-tipsy adults hoping to get even more wasted.

However, most people just watch them from afar, creeped out by the things. I mean, the black voids of the openings were definitely unnerving, to say the least. But, I found an eerie curiosity with them. My grandfather worked in those mines all his life, quite literally. My dad used to take my brother Tommy and I there when we went camping as kids and told us how, ""our grandaddy used to work day and night in those caves."" It’s part of my family history, and somewhere in that deep dark, my grandfather is lying there. Dad had never wanted to go down there, though. He stayed far away from them when camping and if he ever came close to mines, he'd come back home all jumpy, checking every room in the house and hugging my mom, Tommy and I when he saw us.

I suppose that strange anxiety is why he taught my brother and I how to get around those woods and to never go in those mines. I've been tempted, of course, but I've always stopped myself before I ever tried to sneak in. I didn't want to end up like my grandfather, and so, I avoided going near them for most of my life. Still, we continued to hike and camp with them in sight, which slightly desensitised my brother and I to their prescence.

I don't feel that way much anymore.

I packed enough food and drinks for the next couple of days, organising them in my rucksack. Beans and noodles would do me fine, and I even brought my portable kettle for coffee. This was a routine packing that I had done many times before. My tent would be in the left-hand side of my rucksack, with the sleeping bag resting in the middle, on top of the food and water. On the right would be my GPS, maps, and essentials, like first aid supplies, portable chargers, etcetera. Easy enough to remember, even with my terrible memory.                       

I set off at eight-thirty in the morning. Riding in my beloved Toyota Tacoma, the roads were thankfully clear. The bright sun shone beautifully over the Montana fields that day. I took a couple of pictures along the way to send to Tommy, who had moved out of state last year. He was living the high life at Stanford, lucky bastard.

I finally reached Tingrass at around nine-ish. The wind was low, and the late summer sun warmed my body. There were a couple of cars in front of the woodland. At least I wasn't the only one to take advantage of the glorious day.

With my rucksack on my back, I began my trek into the expansive treeline and took a quick look over to the abandoned mines. There were a pair of rangers trucks parked outside the two quaint log cabins, which were about 150 meters away from the mineshafts. I recognised one of the trucks parked next the other, the chipped sticker of the Wood Rangers emblem plastered on the door, ""WUTHERS CREEK RANGERS - GUIDE AND PROTECT"" written. His red dice dangled on the front mirror. Robbie was on patrol that day, usually doing the night shift as well as the day shift. He's my best friend and the only other person apart from myself who knows about what happened. Apart from you guys reading this actually.

I walked through the trees, and followed the Chessock Trail with ease. This trail headed to the middle of the woodland, although I didn't go that far. I waved hello to the odd traveler and showed a young couple where to go to reach the centre.

I continued wandering along the path, aiming to reach Babbler's Brook before ten. Or Brucie's Brook, as my friends and I called it. My old college buddy Bruce had one too many vodka lime sodas and ended up throwing up in the once-clear water, before quickly falling in and squealing like a little girl at the below-freezing temperature. I still have the video.

My timing was somewhat acccurate and I reached the brook at around ten. I slung my rucksack to the large oak tree next to the rushing water. I stretched and took a deep breath of that fresh air, crisp enough to cut silence itself. The bubbling of the water, the cheery sing-song of the birds above and the scurrying of squirrels and other little animals along the grassy floor. My bliss. My paradise. The sun was shining through the bushy leaves of the oaks, providing a large amount of sunlight for the rest of the day.

I spent most of the day there, taking pictures, doodling in my sketchbook and texting Robbie to let him know to drop by whenever he got a break. I also had to send some emails for work; being an intern has its perks, as well as its major downsides.

It was just around four when I headed back to camp. The sun was still high in the sky, but the shadows told me that darkness would be on its way soon. I chucked my rucksack onto my back and trudged back down the Chessock Trial. I let out a yawn and rubbed my eyes. It was an early start for me after all. I just let my feet take me where they knew to go. I was so away with the fairies that I didn't see the damned black book in my way. Why didn't I move slightly left? Or right for that matter. I could've missed it and avoided all this shit.

Instead, I clumsily tripped over it, and caught myself from falling face-first.

I spun around and furrowed my brow. I didn't realise what I'd stumbled on until I squinted at the obstruction in the path. As if it was placed there, a book was sat on the path, closed and waiting. I picked it up and dusted off any dirt that laid on the dark cover. It weighed heavily in my hand, which caused me to clutch the thing with two hands. There was no writing on the front, just a plain leather-bound outer cover. A silky string ran down the side of the pin-straight spine, untattered and a contrasting cream colour. The pages were a slight yellow, colouring the once-ivory edges.

I pouted. This wasn't here when I walked this way earlier.

Maybe someone dropped it whilst they were walking. It was certainly the most obvious and logical reason. Right?

I blinked, then tucked the tome under my arm, the heaviness made my arm ache as I carried it back to camp. I had to swap it between each arm to stop them from paralysing from the constant dull pain.

Finally, I reached camp. It was a place I knew well. Here, I knew the way out and the way to the centre, which would take less than twenty minutes for me to reach the entrance if need be. The sun still hovered above the endless treeline, and showed me how long I had before I was gripped by dark. Setting up the tent was always a pain in my ass, but I suppose everyone feels that way when putting up the damn things. I was zipping up the doorway to my home for the next couple of days when I first felt sick. It was a sudden rush of nausea, bile speedily crawling up my throat and the acid sorching the way. I fell onto my hands, knees already crouched. The sickness reached my mouth before I held it there, and then forcefully swallowed the vile, chunky liquid back down. What the hell was that?

I squatted there a good ten minutes, head pounding like I had smashed my head repeatedly on an iron pole. By the time my migrane subsided, the sun had dropped, sneaking behind the branches of the mighty oaks. I needed the fire made, and quick. Last time I tried to set a fire in the dark I nearly ended up destroying the whole woods. ""*Don't light a damn fire if you don't know where you're keeping it*."" My father's scolding voice rang in my already pulsing head. I was drunk and I was also trying to impress a girl I was camping with by showing her my ""survival skills"". Safe to say, she didn't text me back after that.

Fumbling for my lighter, I tried to catch a flame. I had already set a little bundle of dry branches and leaves earlier whilst I set up camp, so I didn't have to forage for kindling in the twilight. Luckily, the light caught and a small, popping ember began to rise, before it spread onto each dead twig and mossy green leaf. I'd need the heat to be warm for the rest of the night anyway.

Finally, I took a seat on my camping chair. I had left the book on my bag and I was going to read it after I had my dinner of beans. What a banquet. However, I had a call from Robbie whilst I was cleaning up and stayed on the phone for the next couple of hours. I told him to drop by, which he agreed and would arrive later, where he would bring some snacks and beer for us to share. Yes, I know it wasn't great for either of us to be drinking in this sort of situation, with me being in the woods on my own, and Robbie ""technically"" on patrol. However, Robbie's dad was the sargent of the rangers, so it wasn't really a fear that he would be fired, and I never drank so much that I wasn't in control of my own actions. Bruce's late-night bender put me off doing that anymore.

The sun's orange and crimson rays bled through the treeline, blackness oozed from the shadows. I took my last picture for Tommy. He kept texting me about how home was, how mom and dad were, and what his semester at Stanford was like. He'd met a girl called Martina and they'd hit it off. He was living his life, and I was proud of him. Leaving home and looking to make your name in the big, wide world was a lot for anyone, let alone a dweeby 18 year old like him. So yeah, I'm pretty damn proud of Tommy. He asked me, ""*you seen anything cool out there?*"", before adding, ""*apart from those lame-ass landscapes?*""

I was about to retort, saying something like, ""*Yeah this!*"" and send a crude photo, but my eyes fell on my right side. It was then that I remembered the book. It was laid on my rucksack, ebony leather became inky in the sunset light. It would be a while before Robbie made his way over, so I thought ""why not?""

I picked it up for a reason. I sent a photo to Tommy, and I put ""*Found this thing on my way back from Brucie's Brook.*""

He came back to me, ""*What is that? Is it the Death Note or some shit?*""

""*No idea, just found it in my path coming back, it wasn't there before tho?*""

The little bubble popped up, then dropped, then came back again.

""*Holy shit it IS! Bro who you killing first? I know you want to, you psycho.*""

I rolled my eyes. I took Tommy out for a drive when he was a kid, just after I passed my test, and a squirrel was hiding behind the car's back left wheel and when I had to reverse out the driveway I squashed the poor thing. Unfortunately, Tommy and I went out to check and the dumbass screamed so loud it rattled all the windows in the neighborhood. A little pool of blood surrounded the flattened mammal, its splayed out position and crushed head made its eyes pop. Poor fella. I felt terrible, but Tommy was distraught. The only way I could get him into the car was to promise to take him to McDonald's after our drive. He was 12 at the time, and he still goes on about it now. ""Caused him trauma"" apparantly.

I texted back that he needed to get a life apart from consuming anime in his every waking moment, and looked over at the book once more. Tommy sparked my imagination. Someone dropped it. Surely.

""*Well? What's in it?*""

I read the message before I placed my phone on the seat next to me and reached over to pick the book up from my bag. Whilst I ran my fingers along the smooth spine, my phone buzzed again. I took no notice. I just stared at the black tome weighing down my hands.

Lifting up the hard cover, I took a peek at the first crispy yellowed page. It was blank, except for a date written in scratchy handwriting. 30th November 1966. 1966? What? This was a joke, I thought. It had to be. It must have been some kids scaring people. Something black covered a large area in the middle, like how a government organisation removed names and used black blocks on hidden files. It was more accidental though? It reminded me of spilt ink.

I flipped to the next page. This showed a diary entry, written on the next date. This isn't the entire entry, rather a summarized version, as this would be easier to read.

*1st December 1966.*

*Lewisham has been speaking to everyone about the mine's infrastructure. He's jabbering on about the creaking, the creaking from above. Management's been to have a look and they've found nothing. So what the hell is he going on about?*

*I spoke to Tim and he doesn't hear nothing. I don't think Lewisham is made for this, after all if he's worried about the sounds these caves make, what is he even doing here? It's a mineshaft. Honestly, the kids they get these days. Mind you, it's better than the new machines they're looking about bringing in. They're taking our damn jobs.*

*How will I pay the taxes, hell, even for the presents this year if they cut me? Peggy will have to try and pull the weight too, bless her. I cannot put this pressure on her. I will be the indispendable tool for them, so they can survive. I must be valuable. For them.*

I flip over the page to the next entry.

*2nd December 1966.*

*The rest of the boys are starting to hear something from above. I strain to hear things, although I do hear something.*

*Extremely quiet squeaks come from the ceiling. I can't let it detatch me from my work, unlike Lewisham. The man's going mad. He grabbed me today whilst I was pushing the trolley. His eyes were red and dry, very wild and twitching.*

*He says, ""Do you hear it, my friend?""*

*I squinted at him and asked what he meant.*

*He replied, ""The - (this bit was scratched out and I was unable to read it) - can't you hear it?""*

*I stared at him for a while and shook my head. Something wasn't right with that boy. However, I now worry, he may be right. Whether the sound is what he says it is, I sincerley hope it is a wild fantasy of his, rather than one of fact. He warned me of the terror to come, lest we leave this cavern. I didn't see him for the rest of the day after that. He knows something, and I'm afraid I know it too.*

Entry three changed the format slightly. More snappy and direct, almost rushed.

*3rd December 1966.*

*I feel the shakes. I feel the aches. It is creaking, and the boys know it. We have appealed to management to have a simple review of the shafts above. Denied. They make us think we are stupid. We are imagining things. Fools.*

*Lewisham has since handed in his resignation. He cannot go near the shaft without shaking like a leaf or turning white. Management call him a coward. To make us stay here. They care not for any of us, just tin. The damned tin.*

*The darkness groans and it moans. It wants us gone. We all know what Lewisham meant.*

*A source within the Earth has controlled them. Money shall enslave them to enslave us. Always.*

The final entry reads as follows.

*4th December 1966.*

*The men have bolted from the place. Many have lost jobs. I have stayed. Not for my own greed, but for my wife and children. Peggy's boss will not pay her more. They will not grant her the money she deserves, and so, she is forced to work twice as hard for half the pay. My darling Peggy. She should not have to endure this.*

*I am at work, not of my own violition. The mouth of the mine is darker today, and it churns my stomach. It was deep black, welcoming me. Begging and coaxing me to take the plunge.*

*I must. I must.*

*The aches and groans are almost ridiculously loud now.*

*It is in pain, we have taken too much.*

An icy hand brushed the back of my neck, long fingers raked the skin. My eyes widened and I stopped breathing.

It was barely noticable but it was too cold to ignore. As soon as it stroked my skin, it disappeared. I held my breath until I could no longer, wheezing and spinning my head around to see who, or what, that was.

Nothing. Just my tent and the vastness of the woodland.

Even though I've had time to think about this, I couldn't explain what that was. At all.

It was silent and chilly. The sun was long gone and the fire had nearly finished dying. My phone was dead. I don't know how long I was there for. I don't even know how I read anything in that light.

It hurt to blink. It took around twenty blinks before they began to lubricate with tears again. Then, I realised something.

I didn't know where I was.

I am being fully serious here, I had no idea where I was or why I was there. What brought on this random amnesia? Only God knows. Looking back, it had to have been because of that diary. I mean, how else would I forget a place that I had been going to for over a decade?

All I had was my tent, so I switched on my lamp and reached for my equipment. I was not spending my time outside, not any longer. Before I put out the fire I made sure to have a long look at the abyss, and found nothing. Still, whilst I chucked my bag into the tent, I kept taking quick glances, checking for anything skulking around in the treeline. Nothing came like before, thank God. I wouldn't know anyway. The light made it impossible to see anything.

I zipped up the door and huddled in the corner on my sleeping bag, then rubbed my neck. It was still bitterly cold to the touch. It was so cold I swear it burnt my hand. I dipped into my bag and retrieved my portable charger, before I quickly plugged the wire into my powerless phone. I had a while to wait before I could use it with good charge, and I knew that. I think that's why my eyes stared at the diary.

Dazed, I watched as my hands picked up the book again, and they slowly opened to the diary entry I left off from.

It was covered in ink. The rest of the passage was blotted out. I swear there was writing there. There was writing there before. I stared at the black puddle in disbelief. This wasn't right.

I flipped to another page. Then another. Then another. All were a dried black mess.

All apart from the second to last page. Thinking about this even now makes my neck hairs prick up and my stomach drop.

It was completely plain, no ink was on the page, except for the scrawled words:

""*It no longer whispers. It screams.*""

The world went blurry after that, and a growing ringing, no, rumbling climbed in volume. It rang loudly in my ears, so much so, I dropped the diary and clasped my hands over my ears. It didn't stop it, and instead made it louder by adding distant male screams to the caucophony. That hideous din, the fear, the destruction. I felt it all, bones rattled under my muscles, almost trying to escape the sounds by jumping straight out of my skin. I squeezed my eyes shut, tears streamed down my cheeks and my body vibrated, as I know believe I was screaming and sucking in ragged breaths when my lungs ran out of air.

I could hear things wiping their hands against the fabric of the tent, like they were trying to claw their way in. They were slow at first, and then they became more insistant, more furious. Feet began to join the constant racket, stomping and running around me, all were frantic and disjointed. It was like hundreds of men were fleeing from some sort of monumental force.

My eyes, although closed, saw things. Flashes of men running for their lives in the dark, their dirty faces had stretched their eyes and mouths wide, illuminated by the weak parafin lanterns dotted around the cracked walls. These visions would happen for such a short amount of time, I couldn't even remember how many went past my quivering eyelids, and soon it became a frenzied nightmare. They were all from different perspectives, some of the later ones would even be from a third person perspective; a fly on the wall in this horrific desolation. Men had their strong bodies contorted into malformed postions, with their limbs crooked and bent at aggressive angles. Pops and cracks were often heard along with squishing sounds like raw meat hitting a hard surface. Eyes bulged and stared at the midnight sky, as they gawped at the giant chunks of charcoal stone which plummeted towards them, and entrapped them in the perpetual blackness.

These unlucky men cried for their families. They howled for their brothers and sisters. They wailed for their mothers and fathers. God it didn't stop. The things begged for their wives and mothers to help them. Help which would never come. They were abandoned. They were dead, and they knew this. They knew they were bound to their torment. They could not accept it. The shouting grew, and broke into a swirling clamour, whines and moans of pain added to the horrid collection of voices. It was ear-splitting.

Pure inexplicable dread filled my stomach and spread to my mind, as I felt my lungs squeeze inwards and forcibly push the clean air out of them. All I could do was cough. All I could do was shake. All I could do was scream. There was no running, there was no hiding, just death. I could smell it in the air, as rot and decay were now in every breath I took. I can't even describe what it tasted like. It was heavy and putrid, with hints of a chalky aftertaste.

The best way I could describe it would be when Robbie and I went on a walk together in Tingrass when we were young. There was a horrible smell in the air and we both immediately inhaled it. We walked towards the smell by following our noses. I can remember how Robbie vomited his mom's lunch onto the floor when we found out what it was. It was a deer carcass. A huge stag was laid on its side, and its crimson ribs were exposed to the sky. The guts of the animal had been removed, as well as the lungs and diaphragm. The same applied for the kidneys and the liver. The most vile thing about it all was its head. It's eyes were rolled back into its skull and left the jellied sockets wet with dark blood. I could see a couple of white maggots crawling around, eager for sustinance. There was also an attempt to break into its head and squeeze out the brain. Whatever had scratched off the outer skin had failed, and the cracked pink bone was shown. Mountain lions weren't often seen around these parts, which is ironic because Mount Wuthers was literally right next to our town, so it was odd to see an animal this brutally attacked. Rather stripped for parts. The stench was scarily close to what I had smelt in the tent, like I was sat in the corpse of that deer.

Suddenly, scratches cut through the hellish sounds. They stopped in an instant and I felt something warm drip down my nostrils and eyes. The men, I thought, wanted me. They were going to punish me for reading that evil tome. I forced my eyes open and I stared at the crouched figure which prodded at my flimsy tent door. I shoved my hand into my bag and pulled out my hunting knife. I brandished the blade and held it close to my chest. Then, with trembling hands, I reached for the zipper, knife prepared to plunge into the foul creature that groped at my door.

""Matt, it's Robbie! Let me in!""

Robbie. He wasn't supposed to be there until ten. It could've been anything out there. For all I knew, that could've been one of those perished men who wanted to use me to bring their decimated corpses back to life. I blame my knowledge on local folk tales and also the fact I just had a horrific experience that I felt the need to ask him:

""If you're really Robbie, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?""

Silence.

""What?""

""You heard me, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?"" I asked him again.

Silence once more.

""I got you a Lego Batman building set? The Arkham Asylum one.""

Shakily, I opened the flap, my hands shook whilst pulling up the zipper.

Surely enough, there Robbie was squat, dressed up in his ranger's uniform and holding a shotgun in one hand, with a lit flashlight in the other. I genuinely thought he was one of the dead men in the mineshaft. My mind grew dull and my ears heard a high-pitch squeal, something like tinnitus.

His look of concern grew into one of shock and horror, ""Matty, what the fuck happened to you?""

I just sat there dumbly, and so, he slowly began to reach his hand out to touch my shoulder. He was warm. I was not.

He pulled me out the tent gingerly as if I was a wild animal. I don't remember much, only that Robbie had picked up my phone and we had made it to the cabins that the rangers use for their night rounds. He spoke to me, asked me questions. I couldn't answer him. My throat was torn and when I finally came to, the pain made it impossible to even breathe.

I sat on Robbie's bed, a quilt wrapped around my shoulders. He stayed with me for a while and told Tina, the other ranger on watch that night, that I had came down with a cold and I was going to spend the night in the warmth and head home in the morning. She brought me a cup of lemon tea for my throat and gave me a pitiful smile before she left to keep watch. Robbie wiped my nose with a tissue, and when he pulled it away to get a fresh one, I saw the blood soaked into the crumpled paper.

Robbie gave me two twisted up corners of a tissue and instructed me to put it up my nose, as it was still bleeding. He then handed me my phone with a grimace and told me, ""You should probably text Tommy.""

When I looked at my plugged in phone, I had 15 texts and 3 missed calls from Tommy, as well as 9 texts and 11 missed calls from Robbie. How long was I out? Who knows.

Tommy kept on texting me, ""*Hello?*""  and ""*This is a shitty joke Matt*"" and most disturbingly, ""*Stop it!*""

I had sent him pictures, about fifty, all of the diary. They were of the front cover, the pages, the back cover, all of it. I had even taken pictures of the woodland, although you couldn't see much, as they were either blurry or pitch-black.

I had done the same to Robbie. He was obviously worried and confused, and had set off to come and help me.

I then registered that I didn't know where the diary was. I prayed and hoped that Robbie left it behind, and didn't bring that wretched thing with us. I quietly murmured, ""Did you bring the book here?""

Robbie pulled a face. ""Dude, what are you talking about?""

""The black book! It should've been on my right side, or my left?"" My voice was nervous and, even worse, desperate.

He looked me dead in my eyes and told me:

""Matt, I didn't see a book there.""

What the hell did that mean? How? I still don't know the answer to that even now. My eyes stung. The damn thing evaporated into thin air.

Robbie noticed my distress and asked softly, ""What happened to you?""

I told Robbie everything, all with a raspy voice and taking sips of the scalding hot lemon tea. I showed him the pictures and my texts from Tommy. After I had finished, Robbie stared intently at the floor for about two minutes, eyes flickered from one side of the wood to the other. The air was tense and I felt like we had been sat like that for an eternity. Eventually, he took a deep breath in, and faced me. He believed my story, he just couldn't fully process everything yet, which I fully accepted. I couldn't even wholly remember this situation myself, so I can't even comprehend what he thought of all this.

Robbie took the couch that night and gave me the bed. I would occasionaly hear him get up and leave to check on Tina and actually do his job. When Tina was done on her shift, she came into the cabin and got some shut-eye herself. She was probably told by Robbie to stay there for the night. The reason was most likely in case something happened to me again, and that he was spooked by the whole incident so he kept Tina close.

I came home yesterday morning when Robbie finished his shift. He let Tina go home first, we both bid her farewell and saw her drive away in her truck. I certainly felt better than the night before and I told Robbie that I would be fine driving home on my own. He reluctantly agreed, but he wanted to come with me to get my stuff and my truck. He watched me like a hawk the entire way there and walked just behind me for the whole trek. We packed up my tent, kicked away my old fire kindling and sorted out my bag that I had left overnight. Thankfully, nothing was stolen. It was just like how it was last night. The only thing missing was the diary, which I hoped stayed gone forever.

There was no birdsong or any squirrels that chased each other in the trees. There weren't any people who walked by or distant chatter either. It was just dense silence. It hung so heavily in the air, almost like a bomb had gone off and erased all life from the area. I was stunned by how unusually still the woods was that morning, and I could tell it unsettled Robbie. He just stifly put things away and stayed quiet, much like me. We wanted to get out of there.

Strangely enough, the further we left the camping spot, the more alive the woods became. Sparrow chirps and fellow travellers returned, which eased us both. We reached the entrance and hauled my stuff into the back of the Tacoma. I thanked Robbie for all his help and opened the door to my truck, before I hopped in. As I was about to say goodbye to Robbie, he held the door window and his dark eyes stared straight into my soul.

""Call me if anything else happens, m'kay?"" It was more of an order than a request.

I nodded, started up my truck and drove home.  Yesterday, nothing really happened. Robbie came over to check up on me anyway just to see how I was doing. I kept all the lights on upstairs when I went to bed though, I didn't want to be left in the dark again. I slept like a log for most of the night. I only got up once. It must've been some sort of primal instinct because when I opened my eyes I felt as though I was being watched. It was like all the hair on my neck shot up and a hard lump weighed in my throat. I sat up slowly and observed the room. Everything still looked the same - all the lights were on and my door had remained closed. I grabbed my hunting knife and checked the house to ease my racing mind. I found the house identical to how I left it, not thing out of place. The feeling then drifted away and I dragged my weary body back to bed.

I can't tell you what happened that night. I seriously don't know. Part of me feels like it was some kind of bizarre hallucigenic seizure, or just an odd dream. But, part of me knows that was real. It was fucking real. More real than reality.

Something happened to me that night and it wasn't normal. Hell, even Robbie knows that and he's not the biggest believer in the supernatural.

And you know what, neither was I. Not until that night or until today.

You see, at around noon I made myself a coffee and looked through some emails to prepare myself for the meeting I have tomorrow. I left the living room for five minutes. Five fucking minutes.

Nothing could've happened in that time. No one, even if they squatted in that room for days, could've done anything. It simply wasn't possible. I would have heard them.

So you can imagine the absolute scare I had when I saw that diary laid on my coffee table in front of my laptop, wide open with the string running down the crack in the book. It was acting as a mocking bookmark, almost like it was doing me a sick favour.

It reads:

""*5th December 1966.*""

That is why I have decided to write this down. I need to prove to myself that I'm not crazy and I need assistance.

1.  **Know Your Origins:** The region where coffee beans grow profoundly shapes their flavor. Ethiopian beans often present floral and fruity notes, while South American varieties deliver nutty or chocolatey undertones. Explore single-origin beans to discover your palate's true preferences.
2.  **Prioritize Freshness:** For an exceptional cup, freshness is paramount. Always check the packaging for a ""roasted on"" date, not just a ""best by"" label. Aim to purchase coffee beans roasted within the last two weeks to capture their peak flavor and aroma.
3.  **Choose the Right Roast Level:** Your preferred roast level significantly impacts the final taste. Light roasts preserve the bean's inherent acidity and subtle nuances. Medium roasts offer a balanced character, while dark roasts develop a bolder, sometimes smoky intensity.
4.  **Opt for Whole Beans:** Pre-ground coffee rapidly loses its volatile aromatics, diminishing flavor and scent. Whole coffee beans retain these precious compounds far longer. Grinding your beans just before brewing prevents oxidation and ensures the freshest, most vibrant cup.
5.  **Master Proper Storage:** To maintain flavor, store your coffee beans correctly. Use an opaque, airtight container kept in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture. Avoid refrigeration or freezing for daily use, as this can degrade quality.

By understanding these key factors, you can transform your daily ritual into an extraordinary sensory experience. Discover the rich potential hidden within every bag of quality coffee beans.

FTM to a 3.5m old little girl. Not sure if I'm looking for advice so much as solidarity. 

My daughter arrived like a tornado, 6 hours from first contraction to holding her in my arms. I was prepped for an emergency c-section due to meconium in my waters but never got a chance to actually make it down to theatre. Very soon afterwards I was rushed off for a shower to free up the delivery room, and they took her off to weigh her while I was being stitched up, so no golden hour and my attempts to nurse were met with ""ah well try again later"". 
She latched ok but would pop off the breast very quickly again, nurses dipped in, saw her latching and promptly left. I told them she was popping off and they gave me a nipple shield that was far too big and kept slapping her in the face. She very quickly fell asleep and slept for 6 hours. We kept asking nurses if we should wake her to feed and they said no and to let her sleep. So of course she woke up starving and screaming, wouldn't latch and we caved and gave her formula just to make sure she was fed. As soon as she had that first bottle, that was it. My milk flow was too slow in comparison and she developed full-blown breast aversion almost instantly. 

Day 4pp my MIL took us to the local family hub to see their health visitors (not lactation consultants but very knowledgeable) who confirmed it was 'total rejection'. She checked for tongue and lip ties and found daughter had a high arch in her palette but nothing too major. She helped me set up my pump and get the correct flange size and popped in to see me at home once a week for the next few weeks until my supply regulated.
Her and my husband kept encouraging me to try baby on the breast before offering a bottle but my mental health couldn't stand the rejection. My heart shattered every time. So I committed myself to pumping and supplementing with formula.

A few weeks ago my daughter went through about a week long period of nursing for comfort at bedtime and it was a beautiful glimpse into what could have been. It was bittersweet but short-lived as she quickly went on full nursing strike once teeth started coming in and I haven't had the heart to try again. 

My MIL is fantastic, let's state that right off the bat. Amazing Nana, great MIL and she thinks the world of me. Which is why I haven't raised this with her, as she'd be mortified that her comments have upset me. She comes over once a week to look after bub for a few hours so we can go grocery shopping or grab a coffee and her support has meant the world. She has also never once criticised my parenting in any way or questioned our decisions, but her constant talk of what it was like to breastfeed her 4 children (including my husband), in an attempt to be relatable has had me in tears on more than one occasion. 

She's staying for a week over the christmas period. Yesterday she mentioned BF at least 3 times and I finally had enough to the point I thought about it all night and have been prompted to seek solidarity here. Silly comments such as when I was sterilising bottles she said ""so much easier to wap out a tit isn't it"". I said I wouldn't know and she looked a little sheepish. Next occasion was daughter repeatedly popping off the bottle because she was trying to poop and MIL said to husband ""you did the opposite when you needed to poop, surgically attached to my boob you were"". And then later in the evening he was talking about genetics/nature vs nurture and said jokingly ""your kid could grow up to be a cannibal and you just gotta love them anyway"" and she said to him ""I thought you were going to become a cannibal the way you used to eat my whole tit. Boob monster you were, couldn't get enough"". I just went quiet and left the room. She also constantly talks about how boobs are tingling when baby cries or snuggles into her chest.

After she went to bed I burst into tears on my husband and told him I can't take the comments anymore, it's breaking my heart and I don't know what to do about it. He said he'd have a word about her being more sensitive to the situation when it next comes up. Today I've just been so, so sad. I've realised I'm grieving the journey I thought I would have and these comments, despite absolutely being a 'me problem' aren't helping.

I know bf comes with it's own challenges, I love that my husband can feed her and bond with her. I love that she can be looked after my her nana once a week while we go and be adults for a few hours. I constantly try to look on the bright side. To be clear, I am taking medication for SAD, but I feel my dosage is good and I'm generally extremely happy with my life, it's just these little comments that trigger the living sh*t out of me. I don't know, I guess pumping takes such a massive toll on you, I don't have the courage or heart to stop, baby sleeps so well at night with breast milk before bed and I really notice the difference on the odd nights she doesn't have it. I'm just eroded being sleep-deprived and tied to the pump and these comments are like a knife. She's trying to help, she's trying to be relatable, but I'm going to snap if it carries on.

I guess I just needed to vent in a space where people understand. Thank you for making it through this post if you got this far. Sending love and hugs to you all on your respective journeys ❤️",4,1766760246.0,ExclusivelyPumping,7,0.75,False

This post is only interesting to those who are really into Starbucks locations and like to see the new ones (in Toronto they often have unusual designs or custom murals), and in my particular case I am trying to drink coffee from every store, including relocations.

On Monday I noticed a new listing for ""5140 Yonge Street"", marked as closed, which just happens to be the same address as the existing store at Yonge & Park Home which has been open since 2006 (and thus a possible target for relocation). Typically they would not add the relocation to the app/website until after the new store has opened and the old listing removed, so this was quite curious. Another curiosity--the listing shows up on the Starbucks WEBSITE, but not the Starbucks APP. Also, the store number is 4550, an extremely old number that dates back to, coincidentally enough, around 2005. 

I tried to call Park Home, of course, but no answer after a few tries, so I called a store down the street, and that barista did not know anything except that the phone at Park Home is way in the back, and sometimes they cannot hear it. I tried one more store, and they gave me the # for the DM, so I left a message with her. I noticed that she tried to call me back while I was leaving the message, but she did not try again.

Today I decided to try to reach Park Home again, and they finally answered, and the barista was experienced and suggested that the listing was for a store that shut down a few years ago. However, the store he was thinking of was Parkhome Concourse, at 5150 Yonge Street, not 5140, so that's not the answer.

Anyway, that barista said Park Home isn't going anywhere, so the mystery listing is probably a glitch, but the OCD part of my computer programming brain is left wondering how this happened.",3,1766759995.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

I have been out this way more times than I can count now and vacationed in Sicamous over two summers, two winters in Kelowna and about to do my second one in Kamloops. I like to snowboard, hike, workout, kayak, camp, golf to name a few hobbies.

So my question is this... I'd like to try and centralize myself btwn the locations of my siblings - have access tp snowboarding and other activities - small cities/towns are my vibe - and of course, housing costs are a factor as well. 

So far, since I've already spent some time in Sicamous I realized I quite like it there, hits quite a few of my preferences so I might move there or into that general area.  That said, any other spots/towns/cities I should consider and check out?  Why there?

How much does your husband or spouse contribute to childcare when they are have a day off like the weekends/ holidays and other times when they’re not working. 

My husband doesn’t work everyday but I still find myself taking care of the babies EVERYDAY all day expect for when he takes the night shift typically from 8/9- 4. On the days he doesn’t work he wakes up whenever he wants and makes coffee and chills on the couch while playing on his phone. He will help with the babies SOME but I am doing most of it. When I wake up it’s immediately mom mode. I have to distract the babies while I make a cup of coffee and I usually don’t get to drink it while it’s still hot. Is this just what I signed up for? 

I am grateful for the sleep (albeit he wakes me up when he needs help. Typically when both babies wake up at night) but I literally have ZERO time to myself and I think I’m close to a breakdown if I’m being completely honest. 

The holidays make it so much worse bc family acknowledges that it’s very hard having twins but people are wanting to do their own thing so I’m stuck caring for the babies trading off with people when one twin gets fussy and my husband get to play with nieces and nephews play w his Christmas gifts and other random stuff. I am ALWAYS holding a baby and it’s fucking exhausting. Also I can tell that people don’t really want to hold the babies but they do it out of obligation. 

I asked my husband about a babysitter a few times a month so I can have me time and he said we can talk about it and never brings it up again. I don’t think my husband has the patient to watch the babies during the day by himself. My family doesn’t live nearby and his family is older with physical limitations. 

I thought this holiday season would be so much different but if I’m being honest it sucked and I feel so guilty for saying that.

Our relationship has really taken a turmoil the last few years. I have no idea what’s wrong with her but something is definitely off. I see posts on here describing the signs of a narcissist but my mom isn’t the type that will do grand gestures or go above and beyond to make herself look good, I feel like she’s much more subtle. She’s just been driving me crazy and I’d like some guidance, that’s why I’m here. I’d like to know if she’s a narcissist or if there’s just something else wrong. Sorry if this is really long btw!!


1. She puts most pressure on me to help around the house and lets my brother get off free doing nothing. She gets into arguments with me fat more often and I feel like he’s her favorite. She’ll only ask me for help with chores. For example, yesterday on Christmas she only asked me to do all of this cleaning as he was laying on the couch watching tv. She also never asks him to walk the dog. I end up doing it twice a day everyday.

2. When I used to be in high school she would threaten to not drive me to school if we got into an argument. She would say take the bus, despite me not even being signed up for the bus. She said this so many times. 

3. She never really acted like a parent from when I was age maybe 13 and onward, I’m 20 now. She resorted to acting like a literal teenager. Smoking marijuana, drinking, not taking anything seriously, just doesn’t act like an adult. Both an old friend of mine and a boyfriend have both said this themselves about her. 

4. She doesn’t let me shut the door when my boyfriend comes over. I get no privacy. The only time it’s acceptable for it to be shut is after a shower. If I shut it any other time she would start asking what I was doing. Privacy isn’t a norm in this house. 

5. She buys a coffee and a pack of cigarettes every single day. She does this yet couldn’t afford to get me anything for Christmas. I would’ve been satisfied with a box of candy from the dollar tree. 

6. She ruins holidays because she thinks they “suck”. Just because she’s miserable she takes it out on others by abandoning all responsibilities. She said we’d have this huge nice dinner for Christmas and then she said she didn’t feel like cooking so I made the whole thing. Two years ago on Christmas she did the same thing, refused to cook after we bought everything and slept all day long. 

7. She recently made a new threat saying she’s not going to buy me a car when we sell our house and have some extra money, despite promising to me several times that she would buy me one. 

8. She says she can’t cut out daily coffee and cigarettes because she’s not meant for the “poor lifestyle”. Same thing when she spent $300 on a credit card for her own birthday gifts from Nordstrom. She said she needs to live “luxuriously” despite us being broke. 

9. She’s very passive aggressive. For example when my boyfriend is over we are not supposed to go into my room for a long time, even if the door is open, and she’ll call for me saying, “what are you doing?” or “are you going to come to the living room?” She’ll also get angry if my boyfriend stays over when she needs to shower in the morning and she’ll say, “I need to get ready” in a pissed off tone. No communication whatsoever. She loves to ask “what are you doing?” In a condescending tone. I’ll be washing my face in the bathroom while my boyfriend sits in my room waiting for me and she’ll be like “WHAT ARE YOU DOING”

10. She refuses to do anything by herself, even at the age of 60. She can’t take the dog out by herself, she can’t go grocery shopping, she can’t even do door dash alone, she makes me or my brother go with her every time (she’s currently not working), she can’t do ANYTHING alone despite not even having a job for months due to an injury that is pretty much healed. 

11. She guilt trips me. She was in a bad mood yesterday because she hates holidays, so she started giving me attitude which snowballed into me and my boyfriend leaving for a few hours to give her space. She said she didn’t make any dinner because SHE wasn’t hungry and because we went out. Then she called me a pig over text because I “left the sink a mess”, despite cooking a huge meal that no one besides me and my bf even touched. 

12. She’s yelled at me for taking two showers in one day before in the summer. She gets offended when me or my brother shower before her. She gets upset that I spend time doing my makeup (she says she’d love to get ready everyday too but has too much housework to do?), she says we can’t leave the shower running while we use the bathroom or brush our teeth before, if we’re almost out of oil for our heater she will tell us no showers until we get another delivery even though it hasn’t even ran out yet.


13. She is estranged from every single family member on both sides. She isn’t with my dad anymore either. It’s just her me and my brother. She has a problem with EVERYONE, even neighbors are her enemy.

I do run, row, resistance on a weekly schedule. I'm increasing my calories and protein pretty well. And I'm not gaining weight associated with increased muscle mass. What am I doing wrong?

----------‐---------------

Since mid-April I lost 82 lbs. Mostly through walking and later running. Along the way I've developed an enjoyable full 7 day weekly routine and have transitioned from weight loss to fitness. I'm a mid-50s male, ht 5'6"", wt 145 lbs.

Probably the only thing I do obviously badly with is sleep. I don't sleep much and never have. Casein and light meditation before bed has slightly improved that.

I've been working on muscle development so I've been increasing my calories and protein. I don't eat clean, but pretty close generally. I've added whey isolate, casein, and creatine into the mix too. I can see muscle definition happening and I am noticeably, but not amazingly, stronger.

But I'm struggling with how much too eat. I had gained 4 lbs over a monthish, which I thought meant I was eating just the right surplus (plus a creatine bump), but then this week I lost all 4 lbs and I'm back to my final weight loss weight. And I ate more this week than I have since I was fat.  

My current 4 week daily avg is 1829kcal with a p27/c45/f27 % breakdown and I've worked my way up to ~145-150 grams of protein a day. This will look skewed compared to the 4 week avg because the trend is heading up. For example my 8 week avg was 1663kcal. I'm at about 2100-2150kcal a day now.

But my workout routines aren't changing, my calories and protein are going up, and I lost my weight gain. Not sure what I'm doing wrong or what to do better. And I also don't want to get fat again. I've literally worked my ass off for this. I want to eat enough to gain mass, but I'm very nervous about slipping into old eating and physical laziness habits.

Here's my weekly routine:  

**My running schedule** is simple. 3 days a week. Typically a **longer easy run** which is up to a 10k now, a **medium stride repeats** day ~4+ miles, and a *shorter progression run** where the goal is in reading speed and I just cap that at about 35 mins. Additionally I do 2 or 3 little fun runs a week. 2 miles to my coffee shop. 1 mile home.  

**My Erging/Row schedule** is a modified **Pete's Plan** 3 days/week. **A/B week short hard intervals** followed by a **30 min zones 2/3 row** (6kish) and a **zone 2 10k row**. This will change when ny form is better but good for now.  

**My resistance training** is built around four main workouts per week, all full-body but with different emphases so nothing gets neglected.    

**Workout 1:** Lower-body dominant with core support, squats, hinges, lunges, and bracing work.  
**Workout 2:** Push/pull upper body, presses, rows, shoulder work, and arms.  
**Workout 3:** Posterior chain focused, deadlifts, hip thrusts, back work, and trunk stability.  
**Workout 4:** Balanced full body, a mix of compound lifts and accessories to round out the week.  

Each session is moderate in length and volume, and I’m progressing gradually by adding reps or weight when I can maintain good form.  

In addition to those, I do two short daily routines:  

**Morning** (about 10 min): light bodyweight work and mobility to wake everything up and feel ready to move.  
**Evening** (about 10–15 min): core and mobility work to wind down and stay loose between training days. I follow this with a short 15 to 30 min meditation.

1pw5gmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1pw5gmv/panic_disorder_success_story/,Panic Disorder Success Story,"Hi everyone, 
I thought I would share my experience with panic disorder the past 8 months and how I've overcome it. (This will be long)

So first off, I would like to start with a bit of my background. I am a 22M online uni student and was relatively normal for most of my life (although I believe I had a mild depression for a year or two before the panic started).

I believe my panic disorder started from a bunch of things, including stress, my sleep schedule being terrible and some other personal stuff. I think my nervous system was destroyed and completely out of it which led me to some of the worst months of my life. 

I started getting panic attacks after I would go out to eat in the morning with my mum at a cafe, which would usually be after an iced coffee, which then turned into daily occurrences and led to my body not being able to go back to its normal calm state entirely. Those of you with panic disorder probably know how I felt, but it genuinely feels like you are going to die 24/7 and I was constantly scrolling Reddit hoping for a quick fix as I felt like it was unbearable and really only kept going for my mum and my cat. 

I ended being prescribed 50mg of Sertraline (25mg the first week) on May 13th. After about 2 weeks, I felt a extremely small shift which kept me going. At around 4 weeks, the anxiousness got a bit better (barely but a tiny amount where I could notice it a bit), which led me to have bit mood swings where I would feel more agitated at times, or would just start bursting out crying (which I would never do normally). This lasted for about a week and I was constantly checking chatgpt and waiting for around the 6-8 week mark where everyone was saying the 'full effect' would come in. 

However around the 7 week mark I had to move houses, which felt like my progress had collapsed, once again it was like a self fulfilling prophecy. 

People say it takes around 6-8 weeks but realistically (especially if it takes up your entire existence like me), you should give it 12-14 weeks to notice days where you feel 'normal'. So far I'd say Ive been feeling back to normal since October, I haven't had a panic attack since July, by up until October I had a strong 'on edge' feeling as you can see from previous posts Ive made.

I do still occasionally feel panic, mostly when I'm dehydrated, however it is extremely easy to calm myself down now, the panic doesn't own me anymore and Ive learnt that it's just a natural part of life and I have to accept it and live with it and once you can do that, life with panic disorder becomes so much easier. It feels like I won't ever relapse (touch wood) because everytime I feel a sensation physically, I know it's only anxiety and I can work through it. And even if I do I know I can get back to normal. 

Although it may not feel like it now (because time goes extremely slow when Ur in that state), you WILL get better. This isn't permanent and I guarantee you will come out a stronger person. I'm honestly glad that I went through this panic disorder (even though it made me feel like sewerslide at the time), it has taught me so much about my emotions and my thoughts in general, which has made me forever grateful that I have the support that I do and was a real wake up call to realise how shitty I've been treating myself

Some things that helped me overcome my panic disorder:

-Journalling (thoughts for the day, food you ate etc)
-Daylio (an app that tracks your mood)
-CBT (recognising bad thoughts so I would stop spiralling)
-Walks (just get fresh air)

The only side effect now that I'm noticing is that it's a bit harder to cry, and my body temperature feels a bit off (eg my hands get cold easily and my whole body gets hot easier if I'm in a warmer room), but these are nothing.

If you want me to explain anything else I went through or that I missed, or you have any questions please comment down below and I'll be glad to respond as I know how scary it is.

I love the surprise of opening a present, of feeling seen and cherished. It sounds so stupid. I have never had to ask him what he wants because I pay attention.

I've been watching this unfold for months now and honestly? Everyone's panicking about the wrong thing.

People are crying that AI is killing the creator economy. That it's over. That we should all pack up and go home because ChatGPT can now write a thread in 10 seconds. But here's what nobody wants to admit... the creator economy isn't dying. It's just exposing who was actually creating value and who was just repackaging the same recycled bullshit.

I spent weeks diving into research from content strategists, behavioral economists, podcasts like My First Million and Deep Dive, plus studying what's actually working for creators who are thriving right now. Not the ones complaining on Twitter. The ones quietly building.

And the pattern is clear. The creators surviving (and winning) aren't the ones with the best AI prompts. They're the ones who understood something fundamental about human psychology that most people completely miss.

## why everyone's freaking out (and why they're wrong)

The fear makes sense at first glance. AI can write faster. Design better. Edit videos in minutes. So naturally everyone assumes that means human creators are obsolete. That's like saying calculators made mathematicians obsolete. They didn't. They just raised the bar for what actually counts as valuable mathematical work.

What AI actually killed was the mediocre middle. The creators who were just aggregating information. Summarizing books they barely read. Posting generic motivation quotes over sunset photos. Those people? Yeah, they're done. But they were never really creating anything meaningful anyway.

Research from the Harvard Business Review on digital trust shows that as AI content floods the internet, people are craving authenticity more than ever. They can smell AI slop from a mile away. And more importantly, they're willing to pay premium prices for genuine human insight and connection.

## the single biggest advantage you have (that AI never will)

Your lived experience. Your perspective. Your ability to connect dots that only someone who's actually been through something can connect.

AI can't fail at something for three years and then figure out the exact psychological block that was holding it back. It can't have a random conversation at a coffee shop that completely shifts its worldview. It can't feel the specific frustration of being stuck at a plateau and the relief of finally breaking through.

This is where books like  Show Your Work  by Austin Kleon become essential. Kleon breaks down why the process is often more valuable than the final product. He's a bestselling author and artist who basically wrote the manual for the modern creator economy before most people even knew what that was. The book will make you rethink everything about what  content  actually means. It's not about being the best. It's about being real and showing people the behind the scenes of how you figure things out.

The creators winning right now are the ones documenting their actual journey. Not the highlight reel. The messy middle. The failures. The  I tried this thing everyone said would work and it absolutely didn't and here's why  content. That's the stuff AI can't replicate because it requires genuine experience.

## what actually makes you irreplaceable

Psychology research on parasocial relationships shows that people form bonds with creators through consistent vulnerability and personality. Not through perfectly polished content. Through the weird quirks. The specific way you explain things. The random tangents you go on that somehow always circle back to the point.

AI content is smooth. Too smooth. It's like talking to someone who's never had a genuinely embarrassing moment in their life. Meanwhile, the best creators are comfortable being a little rough around the edges because that's where the humanity lives.

Look at someone like Ali Abdaal. His content isn't successful because he has information nobody else has. It's successful because of how he processes and presents that information through his specific lens as a doctor turned productivity creator. The personality. The specific examples from his life. That's what people show up for.

The app Descript has become crucial for creators now because it lets you edit your authentic voice and delivery without losing the human element. It's designed for podcasters and video creators who want to tighten up their content without making it sound robotic. You can remove ums and ahs, fix stumbles, but keep the natural flow that makes your content uniquely yours. It's basically like having an editor who understands that perfect isn't always better.

## how to actually position yourself

Stop trying to be comprehensive. AI will always be more comprehensive than you. Instead, be specific. Be opinionated. Be the person who says  everyone's telling you X but actually Y works better and here's why I know that. 

The book  The Practice  by Seth Godin absolutely destroys this topic. Godin is literally one of the most respected marketing minds alive, with bestsellers that have shaped how entire industries think about creativity and business. This book specifically tackles how to show up and create consistently even when (especially when) you don't feel like it. He argues that creativity isn't about inspiration, it's about commitment. And in an AI world, that consistent human commitment is what builds trust. Reading it feels like having a mentor who's giving you permission to be imperfect but persistent.

BeFreed is an AI powered learning app that pulls from high quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals. Built by a team from Columbia University and former Google experts, it transforms content into audio you can actually customize, from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with examples and context. You control the depth based on your energy level and interest. The app also has a virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your struggles, and it'll recommend materials that fit where you're actually at. For creators trying to level up their knowledge game without spending hours reading, it's worth checking out.

Focus on  sense making  rather than information delivery. Anyone can Google statistics about productivity. But making sense of why some productivity advice works for some people and completely backfires for others? That requires human judgment and experience.

Platforms like Substack are exploding right now for exactly this reason. People are tired of algorithm driven feeds full of AI content. They're actively seeking out individual voices they trust and paying monthly subscriptions for direct access to their thinking. The platform makes it dead simple to build a direct relationship with your audience through email, which AI can't infiltrate the same way it has social media.

## the psychology shift that changes everything

There's a concept from behavioral economics called  costly signaling.  Basically, things that require genuine effort signal value because they can't be faked cheaply. A peacock's tail. A college degree. And now, in the age of AI, genuine human creativity and insight.

When someone knows you spent weeks researching, testing, failing, and figuring something out, that carries weight. When they know an AI spat out your content in 30 seconds, it's worthless. This is why showing your process and work matters more than ever.

Podcast wise,  The Knowledge Project  by Shane Parrish consistently breaks down how actual experts think through problems. Not what they know, but how they think. That's the level of depth that creates real value now. Parrish interviews everyone from Naval Ravikant to Angela Duckworth, and the conversations go way deeper than surface level advice. You start understanding mental models and frameworks that AI simply can't teach because it's never had to actually apply them in messy real world situations.

The creators who are thriving aren't competing with AI. They're using it as a tool while doubling down on the irreplaceable human elements. The personality. The perspective. The specific experiences that shaped their worldview. That's the moat.

## what this actually means for you

Stop trying to be perfect. Stop trying to have all the answers. Stop trying to create  content  in the generic sense. Start documenting what you're actually learning and experiencing.
