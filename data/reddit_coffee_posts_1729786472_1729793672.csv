I was just sick last week so I assumed that’s prob one of the reasons why but I feel a bit better now. I did have unprotected s*x the past month, but we did end up using a condom. It’s also has been quite an eventful month with lots and lots of drinking. I had also drank a lot of caffeine from coffee which also affected my body physically and mentally. At this point i’m not sure which of these many reasons is the cause of my period being late.. I’m also terrified to buy a test..

I haven’t been feeling much cramping, I haven’t had any discharge, but recently my backs been hurting. I’m trying not to stress too much about it, but it’s hard. Wondering if anyone has any similar experience with no symptoms? ",1,1729793521.0,Periods,0,1.0,False

Trying to sweep the floor- the little foot on my barstool fell off. Screw that back on, but hey, are all the barstools like this?  Proceed to do aerobatics trying to flip stools and baby wear at the same time. The rest of the feet are now fixed. 

Back to sweeping. But wait- where did I leave my coffee?  Go find my empty cup. Well crap now I have to make another cup of coffee. Start that up. 

Walk into my plant room and it’s a mess- so I start picking up all the brown leaves. COFFEE. Back to my cup. Now it’s cold so I have to heat it back up. 

While the coffee is re-heating I better start back up sweeping. But why do I have a handful of brown leaves?  Back to the plant room.

The MB is a first time mom and mentioned to me before that the NK was only napping for 45 minutes before they hired me. They 15 month old sleeps on the couch every day for nap and there’s lots of windows and noise from the highway. Not to mention, if anybody wants anything from the kitchen or has to pee you have literally tip toe around. Luckily, I’ve been able to get her to sleep for about two hours on the couch, but I don’t think it’s a good environment for the kid to be napping in. Not to mention that the NK has woken up from the mom pouring coffee for herself…I’ve asked the MB if she sleep in her crib at night and she’s mentioned they transfer her to the crib at night and sleeps soundly. 

With all that being said, I want to bring up to MB that sleeping in her crib in a dark room would really benefit her, but I don’t ever know how to bring it up to her without overstepping boundaries. & I know that her being a FTM she might’ve done her own research, so I’m not sure. I’m all ears for any suggestions on how to kindly bring up this suggestion to her. Also, the MB hasn’t let me take the NK anywhere out of the house, which I think is crucial for her too.

1gb95h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1gb95h5/heres_a_sakuya_headcanon/,Here's a Sakuya headcanon.,"I'll be trying to fill the missing gaps in Sakuya's lore here And I'm gonna mostly relate to AKyuu's lunarian speculation (PMISS). See, I'm assuming that her ideas of lunarian, vampire hunter, zombie all gotta be based on something right? The lunarian one is the most obvious for various reasons...


One, coincidently Remilia and Sakuya's abilities happened to be back to back to that of Sagume and kaguya. Two different forms of fate manipulation and the manipulation of time, eternity and the instantaneous. Now, Sakuya being a lunarian would have a somewhat complementary ability to a lunarian princess. Remilia, vaguely speaking, vampires are a very moon-related type of youkai. Though that's as far as one can go for her since the SDM's background is largely unelaborated. I can't say if whether or not Remilia had extra connections with the moon or lunarians with what we have.


Second, Sakuya's apparent age-questioning made by various characters: Either Remilia herself in IN for Sakuya's long serving duration without predecessors or successors, Akyuu in PMISS with time manipulation being sufficient for her to conclude that Sakuya freezes her age. Or Komachi who just went and said Sakuya has the face which makes her seem like shell never die. That's a shinigami being able to tell the death process is off. 


I say Sakuya had numerous ways for a frozen age whether we count the manipulation of time age-wise as just another form of abandon worms or Remilia's bit of a far fetched fate altering Sakuya causing her to turn half-youkai since her ability is said to have that side-effect and there's no direct relation to Sakuya's red eyes and time-freezing, so jokes aside she could be a half vampire and using Rinnosuke as an example, hybrids are the least demanding in sustenance so Sakuya would be fine with both blood and normal food alike so it's not really detectable.


That aside, if we went straight and say she's a lunarian, lunarians reject life and death. I don't know if it's something that just happens at birth but it's plausible that humans of the lunar capital (lunarians) aren't registered in the shinigami records. To put it differently, Tsukuyomi's kingdom is off-limits for the yama. So obviously the three worms are removed for lunarians from which comes the saying lunarians are like hermits and celestials. 


All in all, aging is permanently removed from their existance. And Sakuya's. Therefore perhaps, she was never a mortal to begin with and Remilia never had to deal with that issue. the only ambiguous part is again at IN when Remilia asks Sakuya if she wants to be immortal too to which she says she'd remain a mortal human. Sakuya's canon dialogues are easily refuted cause she's a liar and just as she lied in WAHH when explaining her ability to Reimu. Remilia on the other hand left a bit of contradiction there between her IN's extra and IN's ending regarding Sakuya's longetivity. But the rest of sources outside IN blend with immortal Sakuya. A Sakuya who doesn't age but can be killed if that's what she meant exactly.


Lastly, there was the removed key info of all SDM's characters on how they met Remilia and going with the mentioned eras, they're hundreds of years apart. Like Patchouli is 400 years younger than Remilia, Sakuya was somewhere in between. That is if the vampire hunter Sakuya is relevant then she'd go back to the vampire hunter era in a vampire territory. Most likely the 17~18th century in easter Europe. Why is Sakuya hunting vampires? Why would someone who was hunting vampires switch to cooking humans to her vampire mistress (If she's actually doing that). 


Well, there's the Remilia beating Sakuya when they met and sparing her easily showing a better treatement than what humans showed does explain how would Sakuya view vampires as better than humans eventually. But it doesn't explain how she got involved with vampire hunting in the first place. My problem here is that lunarians don't relate to vampires in any way to connect the dots, so then lunarian Sakuya and vampire hunter Sakuya have a big missing link and the two are used to explain different parts of Sakuya's life.


After which, it didn't help that Meiling is just as well established with Sakuya in fanon just as Remilia is with Sakuya. Canonically I tell you, there hasn't been anything going on between Sakuya and 1) PAtchouli besides making coffee and expanding voile library for her with space-time alter. 2) Meiling, who waited for chireikiden to let us know she's the only servant whom Sakuya doesn't make her drink(she makes her tea herself). 3) Flandre, besides making her pasteries which may or may not human pasteries. Leaving only Remilia to spend most time with Sakuya at the expanse of all other examples. 


So then, what they had going is honestly gonna be some of the most boring lores to explain. If PAtchouli spent a century reading and writing then Sakuya spent a century making her coffee. And whichever amount of 60~250 years bossing around Meiling who's existence was fixated at the SDM's gate. It can only be less than that span cause Meiling is on the weaker side and China seems to have the market from which masters buy their servants. You know Ran and Chen? Meiling could be a second Chen is all.


The only new part one can try to throw from here is Eirin's side of the story. Which looking beweldered at the sight of Sakuya in IN doesn't say much besides Eirin might've recognized her from somewhere in the lunar capital. All in all,not... a relation they'd want to bring back if anything since it both begins and ends at IN. I think the last time Sakuya was in the same room with Eirin was when they were around Reimu when her soul got sent to Avici in Wahh. But they don't go out of their way to meet. LoLK has it that both Sakuya and YOumu aren't related. So if all this is ZUN's way of implying there's something going on between Eirin and Sakuya but we'll never find out, He outdid himself. There's literally no info I could've start from there.


All in all the headcanon here is trying to prove Sakuya as a lunarian if anything. But you can see there is vagueness all over. So feel free to fill any of those parts. ",1,1729793194.0,touhou,0,1.0,False

It all started at this café I always go to before work. For a while, I’d noticed this girl who showed up at the same time as me. We’d exchange smiles and say ""good morning,"" but nothing beyond that. One day, while she was in line, she realized she’d forgotten her wallet. Without thinking, I offered to pay for her coffee. She accepted and said she’d pay me back next time.

The next day, she brought me some homemade cookies as a thank-you, and we started chatting. We found out we had a lot in common, even going to the same gym. But that’s where things took a weird turn. A few days later, we ended up in the same yoga class, and after class, this guy (turns out he’s her ex) came up to me, clearly pissed. He started yelling at me, telling me to stay away from her, and that he ""knew what I was doing."" He even tried to push me, which was totally out of line.

She ran over and told him to back off, but instead of calming down, he got more aggressive. I tried to keep things cool, but when he grabbed her by the arm to drag her away, I stepped in. I told him to get lost or I’d call the cops. I pushed him away from her, and that only made him angrier. He started threatening me, saying I didn’t know who I was messing with. Eventually, some other people stepped in, and he finally stormed off.

She was shaken up and apologized, explaining they’d broken up recently and he’d become increasingly controlling. I ended up driving her home to make sure she was safe. But the next day, I got a call from the police. Apparently, the guy had filed a report against me, claiming I attacked him for no reason. Now, I’m caught up in this legal mess, and while I don’t regret standing up for her, I’m wondering if I got too involved in something that wasn’t really my problem.

1gb8z0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1gb8z0u/something_the_army_does_well_early_leadership/,Something the Army does well: early leadership experience ,"To caveat first- yes of course there are lots of bad leaders in the army. The army pushes a lot of people into leadership positions that have no business being leaders. And there are lots of leaders who are too immature for their position. 

However, by and large the army does a good job of teaching you the ropes of leadership while you are very young. 

I have been working in a civilian organization where most first line supervisors are in their mid-30s at the youngest and are just now for the very first time learning the very basics of leadership. Many of them have been working for 10 to 15 years and have never had to worry about anyone but themselves. Now, they are just beginning to learn how to deal with people as a manager. 

In the Army is commonplace to find a 22-year-old team leader with better leadership skills than a civilian workers 10 years older than him. Likewise a SFC, who has been leading soldiers for over a decade, is far more experienced at leading than a mid-level manager who has been managing for a handful of years, but is much older. 

It’s been baffling to watch a bunch of  30 to 40 year olds struggle with basic leadership tasks the same way a new TL would leading 20 year olds would. 

Anyways, I guess I’ve come to appreciate the value that the Army places on leadership. I’ll have a large black coffee, no room. ",6,1729792763.0,army,0,1.0,False

I’m just a girl (cue the song ) I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this having some tea and im watching this show called “ oogappels” fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream. I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . Life has been feeling kind of pointless recently and I’m hoping to find someone that makes me abit more excited to be alive everyday ( I know sounds like a big ask ) 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

-Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
-a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
-complaints about nonsensical things
-someone that you can annoy at any time of the day 
-someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
-just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )** 

Does that sound good to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyway ;))

1gb8wr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gb8wr7/am_i_only_psychologically_addicted/,Am I only psychologically addicted?,"After a three-week relapse, I quit caffeine, again, cold turkey. This quit, however, didn't come with side effects. (Maybe, the only side-effect was the powerful headaches that I had on the first day. )

\- I woke up early in the morning;

\- My sleep pattern was normal;

\- I feel relaxed;

\- I don't suffer from acid reflux.

Am/was I addicted only psychologically? I don't crave it. I don't seem to miss it. After three weeks of drinking it again -- and believe me! I had a lot of it -- I just had to make that jump into the non-caffeinated ship. 



**Context.** 



I have been a heavy drinker for many years! How many? I don't know. At least ten. 



in late November 2021, I managed to quit caffeine. In 2022, I had some slips when it came to drinking coffee, soda, or energy drinks. However, I had less than 10% of my average annual caffeine intake.  

  
2023 was the year. My body did not take one single drop of caffeine. Not even from medicine. 

  
Unfortunately, in 2024, I did suffer some relapses, the last one being the one mentioned in the beginning. (I still have more weeks in this year as a non-caffeinated person than one who drinks coffee.) ",1,1729792609.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1gb8wh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gb8wh7/my_weight_loss_habits/,My Weight Loss Habits ,"I just wanted to document what works for me in case I fall off or it could help someone else. Starting from simplest to most complicated.

1. I weigh weekly instead of daily so I don't obsess over the scale going up or down. I follow the trend based on what I report weekly. 
2. I plan meals daily. I researched about a dozen simple low calorie foods to make or purchase from my favorite places for each time of day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. So I never have to worry about calories. 
3. I eat more spicy foods. Nothing crazy spicy. Sriracha and buffalo sauce mainly. Sriracha is almost no calories, and buffalo sauce is fewer calories than other condiments but still can be a decent amount. I use sriracha for boiled eggs and ramen, so good!! Buffalo I save for wings and nuggets
4. I drink caffeine slowly throughout the day. A cup of coffee will last me throughout the morning and curb my appetite all the way to dinner. 
5. I eat at 6am, 12pm, and 6pm and don't snack. I ended up being more worried about ""I'm so excited for lunch so I can eat"" rather than whatever it was I was actually eating. 
6. I give in to my hankerings by allowing myself half of whatever it is I want. After I eat the half I am typically satiated. 
7. I drink more water. Since staying hydrated I feel generally fuller. 

These are just some of the things that have really worked for me without making weight loss miserable! ",1,1729792590.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

Big, dark, and brooding, like your ex after a breakup. Oryx, the Mad God (total loser), has been terrorising the realm with his cringe-worthy cruelty. Naturally, a group of absolute legends—knights, wizards, and rogues—decide they’ve had enough and form a squad to take this guy down.

Picture this: it's twilight, and the heroes are standing on the shipping ports, looking all dramatic, as if they just stepped out of an epic fantasy film. They rush into the fortress, spells blasting—because who needs subtlety when you can make an entrance, right?

They storm through the dimly lit halls, the air thick with the scent of wine and impending doom. Suddenly—bam! They run into the red and blue stone guardians, looking like the world’s worst Power Rangers.

The fight kicks off, and it’s pure chaos. The knight swings his sword at the red guardian, completely forgetting he can stun with his shield. Meanwhile, the rogue zips around like a caffeinated squirrel, trying to find an opening, and the wizard yells, “Explosive blast!”—and utterly misses! The blue guardian shrugs off the spell like it’s nothing.

But after a frantic flurry of swings and dodges, the knight finally remembers to use his shield, stunning the red guardian just long enough for the rogue to slip in and deliver a critical blow. The blue guardian soon follows, toppling over like a toddler in a tantrum. With both guardians down, the heroes high-five each other, feeling like champions.

With no time to relax, they dive deeper into the fortress, hearts racing, and stumble upon a dimly lit wine cellar. Oryx is there, looking like he just spilled his drink. “Fools!” he bellows. Classic villain move.

He starts flinging dark magic like it’s confetti, but the heroes are like, “Nah, mate.” They charge in with brute force. The knight finally remembers his shield can stun and bashes Oryx, while the rogue does some sneaky rogue stuff. The wizard yells, “Let’s blow this guy up again!” and this time—he misses again! Oryx just laughs at him.

“NO! THIS CANNOT BE!” he screams, and we’re all rolling our eyes like, “Dude, yes it can.” With one final swing from the knight, Oryx crumbles like a stale biscuit, and his dark magic disappears faster than my ability to function before coffee.

Silence falls. The heroes look around and—wait a minute—there’s loot everywhere! Well, not exactly the treasure trove they hoped for. Just a bunch of potions, some fancy weapons, and a couple of shiny armours. The rogue finds a potion labelled “Definitely Not Poison,” the knight picks up a fancy sword that looks far too good for him, and the wizard uncovers a spellbook with more explosive fun—if only he could hit something!

They load up on their mediocre loot and strut out like, “We just took down a god, no big deal.” The fortress, once a symbol of doom, is now just a glorified junkyard.

But just as they’re about to pop the corks and celebrate, BAM! They get zapped back to Nexus like it’s some kind of cruel joke. “Wait, what? We have to do that all over again?!”

As the heroes trudged through the Nexus, grumbling about their luck, the familiar glow of the portal loomed ahead.

The heroes groan, realising they’re stuck in an infinite loop of Oryx’s madness. “Guess we’ll have to do better next time,” the rogue sighs, eyeing the wizard. “And for the love of all that’s holy, can you please hit something this time?”

“Hey, I’ll try!” the wizard replies, determined but clearly not grasping the odds.",1,1729792075.0,RotMG,2,1.0,False

1gb8lne,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gb8lne/lost/,Lost...,"This is really complicated and needs back story for context.

I am an only child(f), I had parents that partied and did drugs all the time, they were something close to hippy/nomad/bikers. Couldn't live in a city without getting arrested so we lived out in the mountains, in cars, camping, wherever. They found a ghost town and turned a building into an illegal bar and grew marijuana and made me the bartender and invited the hells angels and it became a place various biker groups gathered when I was about 6 years old. We harbored prison escapees... there were lots of guns and drugs. I had to get up in the morning and make the fire, make them coffee, cook food, gather wood, roll their joints for them. Drive myself to school while they partied as passengers, after school i had to sit in a grove of walnut trees while they were in the bar until after dark. Walnuts were my dinner and I had to worry about all the stupid shit they did like drive themselves home from the bar to realize hours later that they left me there in the trees. 

When i was 8 i had what i believe was hanta virus and they gave me Tylenol and threw a blanket over me and let nature take its course, when I was 9 I had a massive blunt force head injury that dented my skull a bit, I had to relearn facial expressions, they knew if they ever took me to a doctor they believed they would have to answer to authorities so i never saw a doctor until i was an adult. I had to ride out of sight on the floor boards when we drove in cities a lot. I was isolated from other children until I was about 11, they rarely took me to school and later they kept changing schools because we moved all the time. We moved all the time because criminal records werent computerized back then so if you broke the law you just needed to go to a different county or state. 

They didn't teach me the basics like brushing my teeth, changing clothes daily, how to brush my hair or to bathe regularly, then got angry at me for not knowing what they didnt teach me. My mother never wanted a child so held tons of resentment toward me, didnt want me arround her, she was physically abusive. On my 5th or 6th birthday i embarassed her in front of her friends because i didnt know what a birthday was and saw my cake while asking for some water, she beat me and locked me in a room, told me they ate my cake and opened my presents, later that night she tried to kill me with a kitchen knife while overdosing. Childhood PTSD, absolutely.

Until I turned 11 I was only exposed to people like them. We didn't have TV for me to even get a clue. Then I was thrown into the worst area of a major city (a trailer park on Las Vegas Blvd between Nellis and Lamb) where I didn't know how to interact with normal people, I was never treated like a child so I didn't understand why other children acted like kids, i couldnt relate to them at all. I shut down completly, didnt look anyone in the eye, didnt show emotion on my face, didnt speak unless spoken to and was cruelly bullied by people my own age.

They got arrested and I ended up in child haven, I don't know how I was given back into their custody but I was. We lived on the banks of lake mead and in camp grounds for a while so no one could find me to check on me. Eventually we ended up in a biker trailer park on the edge of vegas. 

When I started my period I didn't know what a period was, my mom yelled at me because she had to come home from the bar, then she threw a box of tampons at my face and told me to figure it out for myself and went back to the bar. 

I worked for tips washing dishes and as soon as I had a drivers permit I got an old truck and moved out and lived out of it for a while. Life got better as an adult, but I had nothing, and barely scraped by while I gave my all towards shit paying jobs, and was always serious about working. I spent my late 20s careing for my parents while they died young and left me next to nothing. Couldn't even sign a will so I could keep their property. Ran up so much debt it wasn't worth trying to. 

Because of my childhood I pretty much don't have any friends, I never learned how to make them. I am in my 40s now, my whole life because of my upbringing I have been incapable of having meaningful relationships with anyone. And I am burnt out. People have people.. who care and help take care of them/eachother. I have never had much of that in my life. I have been the one who takes care of others with no return. I have a life partner who stayed by my side for 20 years, even without sex, saying he loves me... so i gave him a home while he didnt work for years when he was younger and now he's head over heels in love with someone else... but demands I be there for him financially and emotionally yet resents me for what I can't do.. and is upset that i am not receptive to the love of my life ... the only one i love in life... giving his time and energy to someone else, he literally wants me to be happy in the next room while he fucks this girl constantly. And I emotionally cant do it. Yet he doesn't understand why. And the truth of it is that it makes me suicidal. This was supposed to be the person I grew old with, the only person i have any connection to
. I also lost my job and I am experiencing health problems. I don't have it in me emotionally or physically to go back to work right now.
I am thinking of abandoning everything I own and going and living on my savings down by the river..  alone out in the forest/desert which I completly know how to do. I feel like I would be happier there... or at least there is justification for feeling so alone.  I just don't know what else there is to do..  i am so broken.",1,1729791843.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1gb8jwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/1gb8jwy/more_on_social_cruelty/,More on social cruelty,"Not sure how much I want to get into a debate before work, but I feel like the interesting reply of u/Upper-Lobster720 merits discussion in this separate post.

>I feel like you're co-opting the term love and faithful and faithfulness into something it's not and doesn't apply to.

To be clear I was talking about faithfulness. It's okay to add love, a related issue but still separate, but still okay to lump together with faithfulness since they both are Christian virtues.

But to address the substance, your assertion is simply fact-free. *Who* behaved like faithfulness was some other thing that didn't apply until after they tied the knot? Was it Isaac and Rebekah? Jacob and Rachel? Mary and Joseph? Adam and Eve? Tens of thousands of books have been published about Christian couples, from Christian couples in the Bible to Christian couples in later human history to Christian couples who are our contemporaries. Who was it? Was it Jim Elliot and Elisabeth Howard? Tell me with names and dates, where I will find the example being set by real people that faithfulness does not count. As I recounted in my story, when I asked my former leader to provide the example he just left me hanging with a text message. Welp, you did, too, so congratulations! You and my former leader must be conjoined twins.

Next, my topic had nothing to say about faithfulness during marriage. You answered at length about faithfulness during marriage because you permitted yourself to go on a digression. Now, as a general comment to other readers here, the best thing to do with the digressive parts of answers like that is simply not to reply to them. Smoke and confusion aren't answerable.

My opinion here, and excuse me if I might be saying this inelegantly, but here it is (again!). To say that there's some time in a Christian's life when faithfulness really is no matter, in effect is to say that God isn't always who the Bible and reason say God always is. I would not believe that if the Pope taught it ""ex cathedra,"" or if my leader taught it to me over coffee, or if an unnamed person posted it in a reddit comment especially if they assert it fact-free. And the kind of person that makes me is ... wait for it ... a Christian! Sorry if that bothers you, but like I said, you can't be a Christian in ABSK.

Then you jump to modern, casual dating. This is gaslighting by way of false generalization: all dating is not modern and casual. Back in my day, Joshua Harris discouraged dating to encourage courtship. While Mr. Harris mainly used the word COMMITMENT, it is the same thing I am calling faithfulness, and it is the single thing that distinguishes ""bad"" dating from ""good"" courtship. But do you know what is an endorsement of the *casual* part of casual dating? Encouraging breakups over faithfulness, just as in your reply where you begin by asserting that faithfulness isn't important and you continue by elevating breakups as a wise response to the college environment. That is not from any example set in the Bible, but it is straight from white Baby Boomers on drugs... I mean the Free Love movement, which replaced our culture's formerly Biblical expectations of faithfulness with the novel idea that you can break up any time you want. To be extra clear: Your position forces *casual* dating and casual breakups on couples who would have been less casual otherwise. My ex-gf and her family are hurt and dishonored because ABSK made me make her casual. It was cruel and mean and morally wrong.

One more thing: ""no longer banned,"" you say. That's a confession that faithfulness once was banned. You sure, bro?",1,1729791721.0,GracepointChurch,0,0.67,False

Before us, she was in a crowded shelter in Texas and then with a foster family for 5 days. After we got her home, she immediately started acting very differently than how she was described/how she acted at her foster home (mainly carpeted with minimal steps and an older family dog to show her the ropes). She was terrified, with lots of growling and barking at us, and she wouldn't go on our hardwood floors (95% of our house) and would only stay under our coffee table on our rug in the living room. 

There have been some small improvements. She wags her tail when I talk to her and likes it when I pet her. I always make sure to check in with her during pets (basically, I stop petting her and see if she goes back in for more pets, and quite often, she does). She will venture out onto very small parts of the hardwood if I throw her toys there. She likes walks and people (although she will stop dead in her tracks a lot of walks because she is scared of something random, lol). 

However, her fear of floors makes a lot of things very difficult. Potty time is very difficult because she hates the setup of our backdoor, and getting her in/out is stressful for all of us. We're trying to build up her confidence (per our trainer's guidance), but it feels like we're traumatizing her in the process. She still cowers under the table a lot and will randomly growl and bark at us (mostly my husband). 

There are so many things I could go on about, but basically, I just want to hear if anyone else in the same situation whose doggie ended up opening up more/how long that took. I know it's only been a month (and yes I know the 3-3-3 rule), but I am getting nervous if we're the right fit for each other. She is so cute and sweet, but I am wondering if she'd benefit from a home with lots of carpet and an easier in/out situation? I don't want to give up, I just want the poor girlie to be comfortable. :( ",1,1729791245.0,rescuedogs,1,1.0,False

1gb89ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gb89ni/getting_flowers_for_a_guy/,Getting Flowers For A Guy?,"Hi! I am 28F, recently started seeing a guy (29M). We've only been on two dates so far but we really hit it off on both of them! First date we talked for 2 hours and second date we hung out at a board game cafe for around 5 hours. We've both expressed that we were trying not to come on too strong at the second date. Feelings seem to be mutual.

First date was at a coffee shop and when I went and got myself a second drink, I got one for him too and he seemed very touched by this, especially when he asked me what he owed me and I told him not to worry about it. I kept thinking about it before the second date. I paint as a hobby sometimes so I decided to paint something for him, and I know he likes tabletop RPGs like I do so I painted a dice box for him. He loved it and expressed that people didn't get him things very often.

We're going on a third date this Friday and I'm debating over whether it may be worth it to go and get some flowers for him beforehand. I don't want him to feel emasculated or like I'm pushing too hard or anything, and I'm also a little anxious about possibly setting an expectation of gifts for every date we go on, but I also feel like he might appreciate the gesture and he's probably never recieved flowers from someone before. I also don't want him to feel like I'm trying to win him over with gifts, I just want him to feel appreciated because I've really enjoyed getting to know him so far.

Any advice? Should I do it? Is it a good idea but for a later date? Should I avoid it?

TLDR: Recently started seeing a guy, he seemed very touched by gestures I made for him or things I got him. Thinking about buying him flowers for the next date but not sure.",1,1729791005.0,dating,6,1.0,False

1gb89hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineIsland/comments/1gb89hj/sunshine_island_tips/,Sunshine Island tips,"I'm on an I****D****** (get paid to play app) quest with 38 days left. Made it to level 24 on Sunshine Island. Because I had so much time on this Quest, I wasn't really paying much attention to Sunshine Island, just working on it a little in the background after working on other Quests first. The time came when my other quests were wrapped up, and suddenly I wanted to accelerate on Sunshine Island. Here's what I did:

At first I focused on Quest book. That was a mistake because they take a long time and don't edify your Islands evenly. Yes, check them every now and then. Make sure you're achieving them as you can, but here's how I started to really accelerate:

Daily tasks first. I hate fishing, but it's open to me, and it gets me an achievement. Daily tasks will positively impact your season pass and get you Rewards. Pay attention to your free tasks in Season pass tasks

Please note I have not spent an irl penny on this game.

Focus on filling deliveries. You need those coins badly. I put boat first, airplane second, and Market orders third. Though that can be impacted by my daily tasks or season pass tasks.

Only fill the boat tier once a complete line is green. Don't bother putting your inventory into other tiers. You will not get paid for incomplete tiers. You may get distracted, and not even notice that your boat is leaving until you see the notification. Yes, you can save up the inventory if you like, but constantly be filling orders.

If you have a daily task of sending a boat, make sure you send it even if there's only one tier full.

Should you start working on the next batch of items that show up when the ship is sent? That's up to you. In a patient phase, I'll do that. When I have time on my hands. But if I'm short on time, I just keep filling orders

Airplanes: my second priority, but it is okay to prefill the inventory. You will need to send all of the airplanes eventually because this will fulfill daily tasks. Should you sit on an a full airplane waiting for a daily task to appear? I don't. I need those parts.

Market orders: these appear in daily tasks and in the season pass tasks. Do fill the orders to get your rewards. Unless I have Parts cooking, I don't sit on any of the market orders that I can't complete. I just press refresh. If I need cash and parts fast, I'll even sit through the ads until I run out of ads.

I haven't built my foundry yet. Why not? It cost a lot of money, staff, and space. I buy metal bars under hot deals for coins. Anytime you log in or are filling orders, be sure to check what you can buy for coins. Will I build a Foundry eventually? Sure, when I'm turning over a lot of cash and parts from production and filling orders.

This game accelerates from edification. Keep an eye on your pens and books and always be upgrading your knowledge. Check your plots daily for their level number. Tap on the upgrade option in the lower right hand corner of the screen. Can you upgrade a plot today? Do it. Level those puppies up until you can't level them up anymore.

Only by seconds and thirds of producers (beyond Quest book requirements) when you're facing clogging or shortage issues. Make sure your people and happiness are correct. (Did you know you could level up houses too? keep up with that.) I was running out of fertilizer fast, so even though I didn't need a third Cow Shed, I bought one anyway. I desperately need another coffee cup producer, but I can't afford one, so I'll sit on it while I edify my income streams.

Use notifications on your most important items. You'll see a little bell when you start production. Tap that bell. You'll get a notification to your phone. This is wonderful when you have 6 hours to wait on a production. Don't use it for anything under an hour I'll tell you why.

If you're having a slow personal day, and you can do this. Set your alarm to check on Sunshine Island every half an hour. This is the amount of time it takes for Marketplace items to refresh. I personally use up all the ads to skip the waiting time frame, and then I actually do have to wait. 

A tip for tolerating ads in any game: I use that time to make a coffee, visit the restroom, do some seated exercises, do anything to distract myself - even a one minute task like dusting the television screen. It helps keep me fit because all of these mobile games are sedentary.

Watch your pen and book counts, and always be educating yourself. Yes this uses up money, but it pays off in the long run.

I am struggling with my guild. Only one player asks for help,and they never run any events. The one player who asks for help is too low level to send help. So I am guild shopping. You can send me a DM if you like. I have no restrictions on what I give for help.

Another tip: I love to play Sims, but I resent that I can't earn any micro income money when doing so. So with Sunshine Island, I keep my phone near me and when I hear pop, pop, pop I pause to harvest and restart my producers.

I only fish because I have to to fulfill daily quests, but I do it. I also do the side quests.

Lastly, I must emphasize that hot deals coin section is your friend. Don't be afraid to spend some coins. Again, I haven't had to spend any irl money on the game - yet and I'm at level 24, with low effort on the first 22 levels.

I find this new strategy is accelerating me much faster through this level.

Please let me know if any of these tips work for you, or if you have better ideas.

Out of the blue, I saw on her ig story a post about a certain song that I enjoyed and caught up. We grabbed coffee to catch up, and we are very compatible: common intreast, life goals, insecurites, our past, etc. We're very open to each other. Time line this was about 2-3 months ago and we didn't hang out much since, coffee twice, walked out dog, and I mostly chatted by sending memes and stuff.

Here the kicker, she has been in a relationship for a while 4 years. And recently, she broke up with her boyfriend (25M) , they were considering marriage and all. I know they had issues but I tried not to pry. 

A couple weeks after they broke up, she asked me on a date and we have been seeing each other for about 3 months now and are even planning to meet each other family during the holidays,

Now all her friends kinda hate me and blame me for ruining her relationship with her significant other. Granted, I do feel guilty. But I really can't imagine my life without this woman. She lost a lot of friends and i don't know how to consult her. I want her to have friends and people outside of me to share her time with. I don't know her friends what so ever. A lot of her friends she made through her past SO. They already have opinions about me, which it's their opinion and they're entitled to feel however they want, but it really sucks seeing my SO cry and depressed.

","It all started with my friend, Elsie, and her invitations to these rich, over-the-top parties. She’s been going to them for a while now, meeting wealthy people who spoil her with money just for her company. Every now and then, she sleeps with them too, but that’s never been my scene.

On Tuesday, one of the guys from those parties, Gavin, reached out to her, saying he’d be hosting another one and that she should bring her friends because it was going to be wild. Elsie begged me to join her, saying everything would be covered—Uber rides, drinks, the works. At first, I wasn’t feeling it, but she kept pushing, so I caved.

She called Gavin and told him she was bringing me—""Melisa."" We took a quick shower, applied our makeup, and since I’m not great with makeup, Elsie helped. By the time she was done, I was looking so fwiiine. Gavin had already sent the cash, so we hopped into an Uber and headed to this massive mansion sitting on 120 acres of prime land. It was insane.

We got there around 8 PM, a bit early since the party wasn’t supposed to kick off until 10. There weren’t a lot of people yet, so when Elsie spotted Gavin, she immediately dragged me over to introduce us. Gavin wasn’t my type, but he was attractive, I’ll admit. He and Elsie seemed to have this vibe going on—they were laughing, hanging out like old friends. I didn’t want to intrude, so I wandered off, curious about the place.

Turns out, the mansion belonged to Gavin’s parents. I figured that out from the huge family portraits hanging on the walls. It was obvious he came from serious money, and he was the eldest of two sons. I continued walking around, admiring the luxury. As time passed, more people started showing up, the place filling with music, laughter, and drinks.

Meanwhile, Elsie had gotten completely drunk, shouting and laughing way too loud. Everyone seemed to have their groups, and honestly, I didn’t feel like mingling with strangers, so I decided to leave early and head back to our hostel.

I went to find Elsie, but when I told her I was leaving, she was way too drunk to care, screaming my name in the middle of the party. I managed to get away from her chaos, grabbed my purse and leather jacket, and headed towards the gate.

Just as I was about to step out, I heard someone calling my name. I turned around and saw him. “I’m Muhammed,” he said, extending his hand. There was something about him that made me pause. I’ve always found Muslim men really attractive, and Muhammed… well, he was *very* handsome. I hesitated, then closed the gate behind me.

“The party’s just starting, and you’re already leaving?” he asked, laughing as if I were making a huge mistake.

Without thinking, I took the tumbler he was holding, downing whatever sour concoction was in there. I tried to play it off like I drank all the time, but the burn in my throat made me cough so hard, I could barely keep it together.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Recently, she came up with this brilliant idea to meet up for coffee with her ex from school days (let’s call him ""Krystian""). Like, who even thinks it’s a good idea to meet up with an ex, even if it was forever ago? But I thought, fine, let them talk, I’m a chill guy, right?

You know how it is – you feel that weird discomfort, but you don’t want to come off as the jealous guy, so you agree, thinking it’s just coffee, and maybe we’ll even laugh about it when she comes back. Well, she did come back... at 4 IN THE MORNING.

Imagine the look on my face when I’m sitting at home, and it’s just silence, no messages, nothing. I text her, call her – NOTHING. When she finally comes back, she looks super tired (but not the “tired after a long day of work” kind – more like “tired after the party of a lifetime”).

So, I ask like a typical guy, what happened, where was she, and why did she come back at that time. And she, looking me straight in the eyes, says “I don’t know.” WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON’T KNOW?! How do you not know? I try to ask more, and she just repeats, “We met for coffee...”. And that’s it. When I ask what they did for those 8 hours, she just shrugs and says something like, “We talked about the old days.”

Look, I get that a conversation can drag on, but to suddenly lose track of time and somehow return at 4 AM, having no clue what happened?

Oh, and by the way, she lost her coat on the way (seriously, who loses a coat?!), and I found a receipt in her phone pocket from some bar (last I checked, coffee costs less than 4 beers, but maybe I’m out of the loop...). And the best part – at the end, she says, “Krystian is such a mature guy now, it was great to talk to him.”

So now I’m just confused. Are my suspicions just me being paranoid, or is something seriously off here? And seriously, who comes back at 4 AM after “coffee”? Am I overreacting?

I just wanted to share this and see if others had a similar experience.

I've had daily diarrhea (or loose stools at best) for...I don't even know how long. Many years. I don't remember solid stools.

And it seemed to be getting worse. Every time I drink alcohol, the next day or two I will have diarrhea constantly. I noticed this happens even if I have 1 or 2 drinks. Yes, I do realize drinking at all isn't the most responsible thing to do woth gut issues.

Last week I knew I would be hurting the next day because I ate a lot of spicy hot wings and had 6 or so drinks. And I was right because the next day I felt terrible. Diarrhea, painful bloating and gas, etc. I was supposed to go out with a friend but ended up telling her I didn't feel well enough but I would see.

I tried everything I had to to help my stomach enough so I could go out that evening. I took a pepcid, pesto bismol, 2 immodium (usually take 1 if I'm going to drink), and then I thought hey I'll even try these probiotics I've had sitting in my room since the start of the year from when I was on antibiotics.

After a few hours I didn't feel great but was starting to think I might be able to go out anyways since I didn't feel like I was dying. After I was out for a few hours I thought hey I don't feel bad at all anymore. I drank a lot.

The next day I knew I'd be paying for it. But...I didn't! I was tired/hungover but my gut felt fine. Later in the day I passed the most solid stool in years. Since I took immodium the night before, I thought that could be a factor (I'm sure it was) but even still I wondered if the probiotics had helped.

I've been taking them every day for almost a week and I don't think I've had diarrhea once. My stomach is a lot quieter. I don't have painful bloating. I've had bouts of gas but I didn't mind it at all because for once in a longtime I didn't feel like I was gambling on shitting my pants.

I'm not having to run to the bathroom 20 minutes after eating or drinking something!

Anyways, I know it's a bit early to get too excited about this but it does really feel like my gut is healing.

I'm sure if I improve my diet I'll feel even better! Also I've tried fiber supplements in the past and they thickened my stool a bit but I would have an occasional harder stool and then just thicker diarrhea. And like most things, I would drink the Metamucil and then just have to run to the bathroom 20 minutes later anyways.  I think if I stack some fiber on top of these probiotics it'll work better now.

Oh I also don't feel dehydrated as much. I'm not losing all that water and my electrolytes arent out if wack. I feel like I'm absorbing stuff better. My motility has slowed down substantially. I love coffee and it has still occasionally made me feel a somewhat urgent need to go but way less than before and the stool is solid.

1gb7zaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/YucatanCenotes/comments/1gb7zaw/valladolid_quick_visit_recommendations/,Valladolid quick visit recommendations ,"Valladolid (Oct 22-24, 2024)
Transportation: Uber isn’t really a thing here yet. Taxis are more expensive (starting at 50$MX) but are consistent. Eg: town to Cenote San Lorenzo Oxman is $150 as of Oct ‘24)
Tours: Chitzen Itza & 2 cenotes $1500 private taxi, $1000-$3000 tour company, Collectivo van with no guide $250 per person. Taxi & Collectivo does not include entrance prices. A guide is worth it, especially if you have not gone to Maya ruins before. Chitzen entrance for non-Nationals was 635$MX Oct ‘24. During off season, it wasn’t horribly busy and we got plenty of pictures with no tourists blocking the icons. Uxmal, nearer to Merida, was kind of a better experience because there were even fewer people and the facades are more ornate. The pyramid has round corners too. We didn’t go to Ex Balam, but know it to be a calmer scene and you can climb on more stuff. 
Cenotes: there are thousands and all are all special. Closed in, cave-like cenotes with only a small hole to the sky are super aqua blue because of little organic material falling in. They tend to have wonderful extreme stalagmites dripping like wax. The beam of light is magic to see cutting through the water and expanding to shine in the pool floor like a spotlight. Bring goggles or a mask! The more open cenotes are more green blue from the tannin of the leaves and such, but have more fish. It is awesome if a lifeguard throws in some tortilla or fish treats in front of you and you get to watch the fish mayhem as they fight it out. Floating on your back gazing up at the sky and cave roof is serene and the rope swings or zip line thrilling entrance into the pool are worth multiple gos! Many cenotes are a whole experience with restaurant, bar, spa, pool, etc. Enjoy the easily accessed ones, but finding a quiet remote one like Cenote Secreto Maya near Yalcobá, brings a remarkable sense of calm. 
Nighttime: two light shows/“stories of Valladolid” by the tourism office are projected at 9pm (9:15 in English) on the zocalo cathedral and the oh so beautiful Convent San Bernardino each night. There seems to always be something going on at the Main Square, Cathedral. Industry groups, like the shoemakers or electricians, have mass together and dances and food afterwards. It’s so cute to see the little children in traditional clothes, and the women dressed up with the embroidered dresses and flowers in their hair.
Food: we just ate street food: lechón tacos, elite corn, paletas, and went to grocery abarrotes & bakery panaderías. Not even any crunchy crepe marquesitos. It was nice to happy hour at our cute boutique hotel with fresh fruit & avocados. Novelty food was a sugar dusted loaf of soft sweet-ish bread filled with ham, cheese and a few mild green chilis. We call it doughnut ham sandwich! I can’t get enough of the habanero down here. The salsa is fantastic if you have an iron belly. If not and you like hot, eat it anyway, and take some Pepto. 

General Notes(incomplete):
* Sunscreen is expensive! - Costco shoppers with a supply of Neutrogena at home, bring it. Most sunscreen in a 400-500ml (standard size) is $12-$15. 
* You must have your passport to exchange money. Passport cards do not work. We learned the hard way and had to use an ATM in a small town with a bad exchange rate.
* Coffee drinkers - bring dried coffee packs to mix in water. it just seems harder to get it and get the quantities we want. It’s easier to get hot water. Nescafé will serve if you don’t bring anything, but the crystal Starbucks or something else you are use to, will taste better. —Uruguayos know how to make Nescafé taste normal 
* Aerus Airline, with its itty bitty planes, is awesome if you want to save time going from Cancun to Merida. $80 each. Great views. Nice employees. Not bumpy. Worth the experience. 
* If you are at a street side restaurant and they don’t serve beer, you can get it at a convenience store and drink it discretely at the restaurant. Should probably ask permission first. 
* Car Sickness - if you are vulnerable, bring meds and take it in anticipation of car rides, especially in towns with one-way street
* Remember to keep receipts because you can turn them back in at the airport and get the money back that you paid in state or federal tax. — so it can be a pain and await to get through the office that does the reimbursement when you’re leaving.",1,1729790288.0,YucatanCenotes,1,1.0,False

Chatting between resting?","I don't feel so great so I took today off work, and I have a feeling tomorrow I will be resting as well. I'd love to chat with a couple new people in between taking naps today and through the weekend if we get along well. Normally I work 45-55+ hour weeks and spend nearly all of my spare time during the week and half of the weekend adulting, so I'm unlikely to be a great long term chat friend, but, if you're open to inconsistent chatting when I have enough time and spoons to do so, happy to make new long term friends as well.

Basics about me: live in North Carolina, born and lived most of my life in California. Politically I am liberal/progressive, pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ+, BLM. I am atheist and I also enjoy a variety of Buddhist philosophies. I'm a fairly cheerful, expressive, optimistic (though admittedly cynical on certain topics) and a realistic person in general. I love being in communication with others and greatly enjoy deep-dive conversations on a wide variety of topics from systemic injustice to car repair to learning all about you and your personality and interests. I enjoy daily walks outside, and when I have the time to drive to a trail head, I enjoy hiking as well. I am also a Miata enthusiast for about 25 years and on my 4th. Other things I'm into: meditation (every morning and evening), Halloween, coffee, board games and TTRPGs, Ren Faire, SCA, ballroom and period dancing, working on cars, evidence-based science, cats, watching fireflies, being social, psychology and social work, Rock Band the video game (that said, I do have a real piano, too), audiobooks, Star Trek, going on historical tours at the local cemetery... I could go on, but that's a pretty decent list. Also worth a mention, I'm not at all into sportsball or anime, don't drink or use drugs, barely watch streaming shows, and my video game playing is as recent as XBOX360 (see: Rock Band. Also, my XBOX red ringed for the second time a couple months ago so that's that). I am also childfree and while I don't mind if you have kids, I don't want them to be the focus of conversation.

If you think we'd get along well and you are looking for a platonic chat partner, feel free to say hi, tell me a bit about yourself and also share specifically what you saw in this post or in my profile that was of interest to you to start a conversation.

My story is long and complicated, suffice to say these are my urine results 5 months after removing significant mould in our bedroom that I had been breathing in for a few years.

I have to take inhaled corticosteroids to manage respirstory symptoms and suspected APBA (allergic broncopulmonary aspergillosis) due to IGE sensitivity to Aspergillus Fumigatus, with adult onset allergic asthma.

I should probably re-test my urine now it is another 5 months since my last test results but it's very expensive. £400 in the UK.

I was having horrible reactions to coffee as well, so had to give that up. Suspected it was the mycotoxins but who knows.

It's hard to know if I'm still being effected by mould or if now I have long covid and ME/CFS.

Been with my older GF for 2.5 years. Recently she fell out with my parents. My mother called in after a surgical procedure in a nearby hospital and had a cup of coffee. My GF was very quiet and barely spoke to her. 

The following day my father was retiring. Before I went up to visit him, my GF would make dismissive remarks about how the retirement wasn’t a big deal and didn’t matter. 

This upset me and I ended up staying out with my parents for the night, celebrating my father’s occasion. 

For the last few months there were numerous arguments between me and my GF. I had a drunken outburst on my father’s retirement night and told my parents what she had been saying about the retirement not being a big deal etc. I stayed with my parents that night. 

The following day when I went back to the apartment, my Gf Was very upset about the situation. I told them my parents knew what she had been saying. 

She felt very upset and sorry about it and tried to arrange for my mother to come meet her to clear things up. My mother was still quite upset about it all and declined. 

Since then, I have been attending family events alone (my GF used to attend all of them with me). 

She has grown to become very sensitive whenever I go to visit my parents - “won’t you be back by X time?” I met them in the cafe downstairs from our apartment the other day and I was back an hour later then I said I would be - she got angry and told me I should’ve said I’d be longer. 

She gave me an ultimatum yesterday that if I want to be with her, I need to tell my parents that I can’t see them as much anymore (I only see them 1-2 times a week at maximum. Sometimes less. But that it needs to be my decision not hers… she told me that this situation is entirely my and my parents fault and that they’re nasty. 

I am close to my parents but in no means consider myself a “mommas boy”. I just believe in enjoying some time with my parents before they aren’t here someday.

However, I started to have an unbearable fatigue and brain fog that has not been leaving me for 2 months and it became pretty impairing towards my job. 

So, yesterday I gave up and added just a teaspoon of coffee to Teecino and boom! fatigue and brain fog were gone. 

Today I did the same thing and the old issue with constant hunger came back again.

I’ve been following this page for a while now, and while it’s supposed to be all about meetups, I feel like we’re missing out on actually making them happen! There’s so much potential here to connect with awesome people across Bangalore, but we need to kick it up a notch and turn those “maybe someday” plans into real meetups!

So, let’s make it happen! Whether it’s grabbing coffee, exploring new spots, hitting up a pub, or even just hanging out at one of the parks—let’s not let this page go to waste. If you’re even slightly interested in meeting up, drop a comment, suggest a place or time, and let’s get something going.

We’ve got a great community here, so let’s use it! Life’s too short to stay behind a screen when there are cool people to meet and fun to be had. What do you say, Bangalore? Who’s in?

Let’s bring this page to life again and make some real connections! 👊",2,1729789118.0,BangaloreMeetups,2,0.67,False

1gb7haw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1gb7haw/recommendations_that_arent_ruined_by_jasmine_or/,Recommendations that aren't ruined by Jasmine (or simlar notes),"I've been noticing that so many scents out there are *almost* perfection, but they use certain notes that just take over on my skin and ruin the whole vibe. 

Tldr: Searching for cozy, deep, slightly sweet, feminine that doesn't have heavy florals or musks (maybe)?

Jasmine seems to be the worst offender(and most often used), and it's all I can smell when it's in a perfume. It takes that warm, cozy, comfy vibe and turns it into something else that is much less desirable (powdery? acidic? funky?). Black Opium for example smells incredible on everyone else (deep and slightly sweet) but pulls a wholly different profile on me and just smells too ""perfumey"". I cant stand magnolia,  gardenia (or simlar), or heavy rose scents either (instant nausea migraine). Certain masks can also pull that harsh powdery smell on me.

Gourmand seems to be closer where my tastes lay (amber, tonka, cashmere, coffee sandalwood are all buzzwords for me), and I've learned that I like some fruit notes to balance those. I also like brighter vibes within thar realm too. I don't want to smell like a baked good or a forest and everything else seems to pack on the florals. 

I can come close to what I'm looking for in unisex scents, but would love to find a feminine option that doesn't pull so wrong. My husband's Armani Code is heaven, but the feminine version does the floral thing.

Closest I've found:

-B&BW Sensual Amber (discounted but damn near perfect-would like an upgrade)

-B&BW Coffee and Whiskey (masculine but layered with vanilla it pulls feminine-something harsh in it)

-Burberry Brit (amazing and has the comfy notes but a but brighter than I'm looking for)

-JHAG Ode to Dullness (Leans almost unisex)

-Aveeno Lavender BABY lotion (so cozy and subtly sweet but not quite the deep comfy I'm after)

-B&BW Mad About You (WILDLY different vibe but an example of how florals work well to me)

-Ariana Grande Love Notes (a little too sweet and something is pulling wrong-soapy floral?)

-B&BW Vanilla and Musk (discontinued and no body spray options)

-Ariana Grande Sweet Like Candy (not deep enough but interesting)

-Prada Paradoxe (something very heavy in this one)

-Glossier Reve (a bit too subtle)

Misses that could have been hits:

-Billie Eilish (not too sweet but basically just vanilla)

-Jimmy Choo Fever (a bit ""much""? Something smelled like grass a bit)

-Phlur Not Your Baby (Smells like body wash and almost in a bad way)

-Coach Sunset Dreams (omg all the jasmine)

-Lancome LA Vie Est Belle (so strong, too sweet)

-Givenchy Irrisistible (too much rose)

-Michael Kors Wonderlust (top notes too bad to wait out)

-Ariana Grande Mod Vanillas (too much musk)

-Burberry Goddess (grandma) 

-Burberry Hers (the floral effect?)

-YSL Libre (a bit ""much"" and maybe too much musk) 

-Ellis Brooklyn Vanilla Sin (all I smell is cherry cough syrup and baking almond extract)

So many good folks have left such heartwarming comments and DMs after my first post here I am so I’m writing an update to the cliffhanger. 

Alas, whispers of confessions and desire has led me to this moment here. Brief TLDR is that I’ve fallen in love with my Slowly penpal, and when I realized feelings were reciprocated, we moved onwards to short form text, video calls, FaceTime until eventually… meeting in person.

We were lucky that we weren’t terribly far from each other, and hour-ish flight away by plane and the moment I had an excuse to visit a city near him, I jumped so fast to the opportunity. 


I was shocked at how fast our relationship progressed even before meeting each other. 
Our conversations were always so natural even in letters, being able to put a face and a soundtrack to this anonymous icon… was quite inconceivable. Who would’ve guessed i would find myself so hopelessly in love with someone I’ve yet to meet? He asked, if he could call me his only a few weeks in. I obliged and started to count down the days till I could see him in person.


“the wait must be succulent for the release to be sweet” was the running joke in between us that turned out not to be a joke haha. The wait was so AGONIZING, and god I see myself now to be so pathetic to be down so bad for a… for a …a boy! 

Finally,  the faithful day comes. October 18th. A mere few days I stayed at his place and , it truly was just a dream. His presence, his touch and feel, exceeded anything I could have even imagined. He took me to experience the most amazing foods (hotpot, coffees, pastries), we climbed at the local rock gym, walked to his alma mater and experienced the most beautiful scenes of the horizon. It all went by way way too fast. Before I know it, I’m back in my city and I dream of that dream through endless layers of wondering , if any of it even happened lol. 

Nonetheless, I write this to either keep track of my delusions, or to share perhaps, the most magnificent, and beautiful little thing I have ever felt. Call it what you will, I still am not sure what it is. ",14,1729788750.0,SLOWLYapp,3,0.94,False

I’ve decided to pursue a career in Instrumentation and Controls, and I’m looking for some guidance. I’m 37 years old, based in Red Deer, Alberta, and have a varied academic and professional background:

* Diploma in Journalism
* B.A. in Linguistics
* Diploma in Web Development
* Most of my adult life spent working in professional kitchens, so I’m no stranger to hard work or long hours.

Here are my main questions:

* **Pathway**: Should I first apply for the provincial trades program (AIT), or can I start applying for entry-level jobs right away?
* **Certifications**: Some job postings mention H2S, CSO, First Aid, etc. Should I pay for these certifications upfront, or do employers usually cover the cost?
* **Union**: Is there a union in Red Deer for I&C professionals? I haven’t found much information online.
* **Networking**: Is it appropriate to reach out to people in the field for coffee chats or informational interviews to learn more and make connections?

Additional context:

* I’ve been unemployed for the past year and a half due to life issues (now resolved), and I’m eager to get back into the workforce.

I’m serious about making this transition and would really appreciate any advice or insights from those with experience in the field.

Have you ever been worried about Listeria before you got pregnant? Have you ever actually got it before? If the answers are no, and you’re eating the same kind of food from the same places, the chances are extremely low that you will get it. 

Accidentally having a sip of something with alcohol or CBD/THC in it? Your baby will be fine.

Using essential oils a few times is fine.

Exercising is fine. Better than fine actually. 

You were drinking and smoking right before you got pregnant - people do that all the time. 

Sex won’t hurt your baby - in fact the increased blood flow may benefit them. Oxytocin won’t induce labor till your baby is ready to come out.

Both my parents are doctors and confirmed the tachycardia by feeling my pulse. They recommended I do more exercise, and though the tachycardia didn't occur as often when I started jogging it didn't completely stop. I've gone with two separate cardiologists for this:

In 2021, Cardiologist 1 first ran an EKG and said everything looked normal. For added reassurance he sent me home with a Holter monitor, and during the day I had the Holter I actually felt some tachycardia so I was looking forward to the doctor's input. However when I went to return the Holter monitor the doctor realized my father was a fellow doctor he knew, and although he generously didn't charge me for the Holter, he didn't give me a follow-up on the results. He simply told me there was no need to go back to his office, called me to my cellphone, and said 'you're fine' and that was it.

In 2024, Cardiologist 2 again ran an EKG and everything was normal, but I requested a cardiac stress test just to be sure. He said the results were normal and my heart is seemingly healthy.

Despite getting two different opinions I can't help worrying because of some symptoms I'm still experiencing: 

--The tachycardia doesn't happen as often but I still feel it from time to time (it lasts about 10-40 seconds)

--When I wake up about half of the time my heart is racing

--If I get too invested in a videogame my heart starts racing. This happens specifically in rhythm games (which I play with my hands) when I'm about to get a full combo

--Walking up hills or going upstairs makes me feel winded very quickly and gets my heart racing. I could walk miles on an even path without problem but as soon as it starts going upwards it gets tiring very quickly.

--Doing hard cardio wears me down. My swimming coach just started trying to get me to swim fast for possible races and with less than 2 minutes of fast swimming my heart is pounding and it takes me several minutes to recover my breath. In that time I swim a distance of 50 meters.

As for relevant medical history, only my paternal grandfather had cardiac-related issues, having passed away in his 70's from a complicated arrhythmia. Cardiologist 2 diagnosed me with familial dyslipidemia because of my high level of fat in my blood (I remember specifically triglycerides) even though I weigh 69kg (152.119lbs?) and my height is of 1.69m (approximately 5'5). He mentioned that it MAY lead to cardiac problems down the line, but around my 50's, and even then it wasn't a guarantee. I also have IBS but I doubt it's related. 

Other than that I have a balanced diet, go swim twice a week, don't smoke, rarely drink alcohol and zero coffee. I know I'm young and should be reassured by the opinion of two professionals but I'm scared I may have some sort of underlying sickness that bypasses most tests or a genetic issue that started showing signs just now. 

My younger sister had a period where she also had tachycardia but not only does she drink a lot of coffee and it eventually stopped, but her doctor at the time told her that's a thing that can happen randomly to young women just because? I was hoping it was the same for me but it's been 4 years and it's still happening.

After a week I decided to give it another shot since the coffee was so expensive, and wow, I was blown away at how differently it tasted! Going to a coarser grind and lower brew temp eliminated the sour flavors and brough out the body - high notes of cinnamon and a smooth, chocolate aftertaste. It is the best cup of coffee I've ever had.

I was so excited about this that I had to share the lesson I learned, which I'm sure many here have already figured out - changing your brew can make a big difference in how a particular coffee tastes. A particular brew may work well for one set of coffees but be a bad choice for others.

Here's my recipe for anyone interested.

Ingredients:

• Coffee: 17 grams , medium grind (6.5 on the 1zpresson K-Ultra)  
• Water: 240 ml (about 8 ounces), heated to 86 C

Instructions:

Water: 86 C

Brew Inverted, single paper filter

Steps

1. Bloom by pouring 50 ml of water and stir gently 5 times
2. At 30 sec pour remaining water for a total of 240 ml
3. Stir back-forth, side-side four times, then place the cap with a wetted paper filter
4. At 1:30, flip the AeroPress and start the plunge
5. Plunge for about 1 minute for a total time of 2:30",8,1729788123.0,AeroPress,5,1.0,False

1gb71aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gb71aa/navigation_dating_scene_28m/,Navigation dating scene (28m),"This may be a bit long winded and I apologize in advance.

I got out of a 2 way toxic relationship about 4 months ago. We weren't really good for eachother. I have admitted my faults and have seemed help with a therapist. We planned on revisiting the relationship a year later, but the more time I spend away from her things seem to be better. Less drama, more free time, not struggling for money as much, etc. 

To the meat of the story: 

I have friends and even my boss trying to hook me up with people. I haven't had to court someone in the dating scene in about 8 years. Recently my boss exchanged my number with a lady he sees semi frequently. I haven't messaged her yet because I am honestly scared. I know nothing about her. Not her age, occupation, or anything. I have just her number and name. I'm honestly worried about making a fool of myself ( I stutter, moreso when I'm nervous. Kinda started with my last relationship). I'm also worried that we won't have any chemistry and I am really bad at letting people down/go. 

I'm not sure how to navigate this. If it isn't obvious by now, I have really low self esteem /worth. My best friend talks me up with stuff like ""you've got a house, a sports car, a bike, a secure job, attractive, cook well, clean, responsible  etc.."" but most of it is material items. I honestly just want someone that wants me for me and not what I have. I am currently working on my self esteem by getting back into shape, but some aspects of me are hard to get over because I can't change them. I'm also afraid because the last women I thought I had made a friend called me a creep. We use to chat about anime and similar tastes in music. I had a bunch of NSFW anime stuff that I was never going to use and she said she was interested in it, so I sent her pictures and said ""whatever you want you can take. Everything else is going to get sold"" after that she called me a creep. 

I was given some advice to kind of scope the lady my boss is trying to introduce me to because there's one of three places she could work, but honestly I don't want to do that because it seems kinda creepy and stalkerish. 

Any advice on how to navigate this would be awesome. I'll be talking to my therapist today about it to get her perspective on it. Should I just end up messaging her and maybe ask to exchange pictures and start texting? Or should I just dive in and see if she wants to meet up for some coffee? So many questions.",1,1729787913.0,dating_advice,1,0.99,False

1gb6qly,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gb6qly/aitah_for_not_allowing_my_toxic_family_to_visit/,AITAH for not allowing my toxic family to visit my sick father in my house?,"(M/29) There's a lot of context for this, but I'll try to summarize.

My relationship with my family was broken, chaotic, abusive, and dysfunctional. They were physically and verbally abusive and caused significant damage to my mental health.

My mother and I live in Spain, but we're separated. My father lives in Venezuela. He became sick, received a bad diagnosis, and had little to no hope. This put me in a difficult financial situation because I was recently moving to a new apartment.

My relationship with my mother was bad, but it was okay at the time compared to the past. So, I thought it would be a good idea to surprise my father on his birthday to cheer him up. I planned everything and invited my mother. I was missing some money to spend three months there. I don't know why, but I asked my mother for help.

My brother didn't know about my plans, as it was a surprise. He had to spend $600 on medicine for my father, but instead of talking to me, looking for help... he texted me terrible things, calling me a miserable human being and sending invoices for everything. Even when I later explained that I was saving money for the trip in that moment, that I really appreciate his efforts and I will retribuit to him, he said I should have sent the money instead of flying.

I went to therapy before to become a better person and try to understand my imperfect family, but no one prepared me for this kind of shit. 

My mother acted like I was the reason for my father's illness and said things I didn't want to discuss. So let's skip that part. 

Our relationship ended there.

The main reason for this post:

We arranged a reunion where I agreed to use my recently approved credit card to cover all the expenses for my father to come live with me in Spain, hopefully extending his life.

The agreement was that they would help me with the monthly payments on the card. I had requested unpaid time from work for this trip and already owed $1,000 to my mother. So I wasn't in a very good spot. 

In addition to the tickets, I had to buy a portable oxygen machine and many other things to adapt the house for my father that he even didn't know he needed. Let's say it cost around €3,000.

He's been living with me for six months, and he's doing much better. He now has hope of getting a lung transplant. Everything is going well. 

The problem is that no one has given me a penny as they promised. I'm drowning in debt because this supposed to be family thing, but I was naive. I have to cover my father's general expenses too, happy to do it, but it's been fairly more than the 600€ my brother paid one time and I didn't send invoices to no one. 

After paying all my bills, and credit card, I have only about €80 left for the entire month.

I explain this bc my mother started telling everyone in our circle that I'm a thief, that I stole from her. Now, in my childhood neighborhood, I'm known as a thief. She didn't even need the money; she just wanted to hurt me. As a punishment for cutting the communication with her. 

I eventually paid her back when I could catch my breath from the debt.

The same brother who said I should have sent money instead of visiting my father is now flying to visit him, but he hasn't sent any money.

I've endured so much from everyone and haven't reacted for my father's health. Screaming, insults, gossip, humiliation—they've done it all, and I've said nothing.

But my house is sacred. It is the only place free from their negativity and poison. I don't want them here, criticizing or gossiping. The only idea of them sitting in my couch makes me feel sick. 

My father can go out with assistance. I'm not denying him the opportunity to have coffee or dinner with his family, but I don't want anyone herem

I am the asshole? I'm overreacting?
