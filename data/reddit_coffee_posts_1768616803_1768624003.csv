Besides i am not gonna make the mistake like yesterday.
No quitting of coffee , tea and nicotine gum.
Perhaps gonna keep the dose at the same. 
Morning is the high time to change the habbits.

Besides I am thinking really hard about quitting certain substances.
Like cannabis edibles , pregablin , alprazolam.

1qf3a3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1qf3a3i/the_gentleman/,The Gentleman,"Have you ever been one of those people who wished they could look young forever? No grey or white hair, crow’s feet, or wrinkles? Things stay in place where they’re supposed to be and do not submit to gravity. Alec is one of those people. He researched ways to remain youthful, including natural and medical methods.

Things he tried and knew wouldn’t work. Then, something interesting popped up during his searches on an occult website. It was titled *Wishing for Eternal Youth*.

Eternal youth? Alec wanted to look young forever, but eternal youth sounded even better. As a gentleman in his early forties, he still wanted to maintain his attractiveness.

Clicking on the link, he read the blog posts until he discovered a peculiar one that caught his interest. He honestly thought it was a joke. “People with pure hearts have unique antibodies in their liver. When it is cooked and eaten, it will give you a youthful appearance,” Alec read aloud to himself.

This can’t be real. Below is an email to contact. Deciding to try it, he sent a message expressing his interest. He was surprised when he was answered within the hour and given an address to go to.

Curious, he goes to the location provided, which turns out to be a graffiti-ed food truck set up on a bunch of cinder blocks. A dim light is inside, and a cloud of white smoke drifts out. A strong smell fills the air, making Alec cover his nose.

“You must be the guy,” a man cooking on the grill says over his shoulder without turning around. “I’ll be done shortly, so have a seat.”

Alec looks around, spotting two wooden picnic tables and sitting at one of them. The area is empty except for the food truck, two tables, and a beaten-up blue truck. Surrounding that was a sea of trees. After a while, the man walked up to Alec and set down what he’d been cooking in front of him.

""There you go. Go ahead and dig in. You want to get younger, don’t you?”

The man chuckled, watching the other stare at the meat before him.

It was smaller than an animal. Alec picked up the knife and fork and dug in. When he was finished, he looked at the man who owned the food truck. “How do I know if this will work?” he asked.

“It takes time, Alec. Something like this won’t happen immediately. Go home, get some sleep, and when you wake up, see the results come back,” the man replied. There has to be some trick, Alec thought.

Begrudgingly, he agreed and went on his way back home. Tomorrow morning, he’d check to see if this occult trick was worth it. Early in the morning, Alec awoke and began his day. He made his cup of coffee and then went to take a shower. He placed his cup down to wash his face before stepping into the shower and raised his head, peering into the mirror. When he saw his reflection, a surprised sound escaped his lips.

He couldn’t believe it. Alec, indeed, looked younger. Even the skin on his hands was smooth. They weren’t extreme changes, but the traces of age were gone. By the time he was dressed, Alec had decided to see that man again, so he sent another email. This time, he was told a different location and time. He agreed and went to meet him.

The old apartment building appeared to have seen better days, with its siding barely hanging on and unkempt grass surrounding it. Walking up the creaking staircase, he knocked on apartment number thirteen. There was rustling inside.

There was a sound of a click, and the door opened.

“Good, you came,” the man smiled ear to ear.

“Yes, I was wondering if there was any way I could procure another,” Alec said. “If that is what you wish, then step inside, Alec,” the man replied, letting Alec in and closing the door. The man led him further inside to a room covered in translucent plastic tarps, and in the center of the room was a table with an unconscious young woman.

He picked up a scalpel and turned it over, noticing Alec had gone stiff.

“If I had more time, I would have prepared it for you, but I was thinking.”

Since you were so interested in becoming young again, why not let you in on the process?” the man told him. Alec felt frozen in place. What he had eaten before was a human liver. His bottom lip trembled, and the man offered the scalpel.

“Go on. I already marked the area so you will see where to cut, and she won’t be waking up soon,” the man told Alec, ushering him toward the table. Was he going to do this? Cut up an innocent woman all for youth?

Now, standing over her, he couldn’t help but have a smile twitch at the corner of his mouth. “I’m sorry,” he whispered before making the first cut to continue his eternal youth.",1,1768623419.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False
1qf37y2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qf37y2,Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa Review,"Fragrance Notes (according to fragrantica)

Top Notes: Cardamom, Cinnamon, Ginger 

Middle Notes: Praline, Candied Fruit, White Flowers

Base Notes: Vanilla, Coffee, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Musk

On the first spray, like some lattafa fragrances in my experience, i seem to smell the base notes straight away in the opening with the other notes coming in like touches on the top that seems to make the fragrance more smooth and adds a hint of complexity to it. On the dry down you get a very boozy and vanilla scent. (or like many fragrance influencers like to say it smells like a christmas candle which is totally correct.) 

It’s very winter/fall weather kind of fragrance. It will perform and smell the best in cooler weather as it’s very vanilla, cinnamon and tonka bean heavy. 

The coffee bean note is very light and just a touch on top giving the fragrance a more interesting and imo a more versatile hint to it. Just a warning it will not smell like the traditional kind of coffee scent.

The presentation is amazing with a better box then most niche and designers and a nicer bottle then nearly all designer fragrances. May take up too much space if you have a big collection.

I wouldn’t say this fragrance is blind but safe as a lot of my friends say it smells very different to what i smell it to be like. The cinnamon may be too in your face to some people as well so if you are unsure, go to the store and try it ON SKIN not tester strip. If you can’t find a store then go online and get a decant of it but really it’s $50AUD you can’t really go wrong and if you really don’t like it, you can resell it for about $20 or so.

Projection is really good as in like room filling and the sillage is alright staying in the room about a minute or so after you leave. Unlike many fragrances i don’t see this one to be changing a lot after application maybe just abit on the dry down. Longevity im definitely getting 12+ hours on it.

I’ve heard people say the OG is an inspiration of Killian’s Angel Share so i had to go and try it. From the khamrah qawha i’m getting about a scent 80% similar which is great for the price.

Overall was a great purchase. Not blind but safe. Quite high quality definitely for the price. Worth it if you like the scent after trying. Can’t go wrong.

The moment I saw the heavy wooden door, I knew I was in for a serious cup of coffee. Served in an exquisite, intricately patterned gold-rimmed cup, the dark roast coffee here was a masterpiece. It was incredibly smooth and full-bodied, with a deep, lingering bitterness that lacked any harsh acidity. The aroma was amazing. The pudding was the perfect companion to their bold coffee. It was a classic, “firm style” Japanese custard pudding (showa retro style) topped with a cloud of fresh whipped cream and a bright red cherry.

The owner was showing off her new menu to regulars. Everyone was complimenting the design. Someone asked if she hired a designer. She laughed and said no. Turns out she made it herself. Zero design training. Just figured it out as she went.

This keeps happening. My kid's teacher designed the school newsletter. My uncle made flyers for his hardware store. None of them ""learned design"" in any traditional sense.

What changed? They're all using AI that teaches while you work. Not generating finished designs, actually teaching principles. You mess up spacing, it explains why. Your colors look off, it shows you better options. Your text hierarchy is confusing, it walks you through fixing it. It's like having a design teacher looking over your shoulder. Way cheaper than hiring someone full-time.

The economic implications are interesting. Small businesses that used to pay $200-500 for basic design work are just doing it themselves now. Design students are worried. Professional designers are adapting by focusing on complex branding that AI can't handle yet.

This feels like what happened with photography. Smartphones didn't kill professional photographers, but they definitely changed who needs to hire one.

My experience in accounting has not been the greatest so far, and I really don't know if I'm doing something wrong.

**PwC**

I was an intern at PwC for 3 months, loved the first month, I could work as much as I wanted and just bang out assignment after assignment. 

The last two were quite literally horse shit, I switched teams, and worked under a guy who had his first intern, that year he also had the biggest client of the department (who no one else wanted, apparently it's always a shit case - so I don't really blame him).

There were so many days where I had no assignments at all, at some point I literally had nothing to do for a whole week straight, I asked everyone in the department if I could help with something, but apparently it would be too hard to let an intern do, or it would take too long to get the clearing, or whatever. So I spend the days just looking at my coworkers work, or going through my old assignments making them again.

I even ended up asking someone from investment banking, who I had met at the coffee machine, if they could use some help for a couple of hours a day, or when I had no assignments myself, so I got a presentation from them about what they do, but again it wouldn't make sense, unless I did it full time.

I asked my supervisor so many times to the point, I'm pretty sure, he gave me random work just to shut me up. One time I had to pull the underlining transactions for every accounting line of 28 subsidiaries, cleaning up the data, and linking it to something else. Everyone I talked to about it, had never even heard of it before. Basically it was just a monkey see, monkey do- type of work with the same 3-4 step over and over again. I got so bored doing it, I got determined to finish as quickly as possible, so I could get something else to do. I spend probably every waking hour for the next two or three days to finish.

Otherwise I had to do Checking Copy (don't really know if it's a standard practice) on two big companies with 28 and 24 subsidiaries alone, at one point I had to show a junior associate, who had been at PwC for a while, how to do it, and he was like:

""This is the most boring assignment I have had so far in my time here"" (we did like 4 each for that company.. I did over 50 alone :)

For 15-25% of my time there, I actually had to do some fun work like OPEX, intercompany or smth like that. 

I simply vowed to myself I would never work at The Big 4, or at least at PwC again.

**Small firm** 

So I applied to a smaller firm with around 30 employees, and was there for 2 months on a time-limited contract from may to july last year, where I was supposed to get on a trainee contract last September, but was called doing the summer vacation that they couldn't follow through with the contract because of some internal structural change, he apologized and ended up paying my tuition for first semester of my education going forward.

For those two months, I was sure, I finally found the place where I could learn the trade, first 1,5 month were amazing, I actually had assignments to do.

During the first month I was even asked to go meet a client alone to help him find invoices for his bookkeeping (he is not that tech savvy), so I met up with him and his bookkeeper/accountant (I'm a auditor - idk, we have a different system or smth where I live). 

Anyway he was really happy with me, called my boss and praised me a lot. Later on, even after I split with the firm, he asked me to come and help him again.

Now the last two weeks..

The firm had an event coming up, for some reason I ended up getting in charge for the event coordination (some of it anyway), I had to order table cards with the attendees, name plates, gift baskets (37 baskets, it filled the whole office), roll ups (I ended up having to create my own design for the roll up because the firm was quite late out, so we couldn't find a grafical designer, so I spend 27 hours straight at work signing up for free trials for professionel tools and creating the design - which ended up being pretty damn good). At some point I basically became the guy everyone went to with administrative ad-hoc tasks, since I was the newest and everyone was busy. I was setting up everything with the hotel for the attendees, the restaurants they had to go to, intern administrative tasks placing fruit bowls on the floors, changing the printers ink, setting up for breakfast etc etc.

The last two weeks I did around 4 hours of actual accounting work.

It has almost been a year now, I haven't found a new trainee position, since every company I talked to already found their candidates.

So no progress in my career for basically a year, I haven't even started really, and it just feels like I can't catch a break and just become good. That is all I want. But right now, my motivation is at it's all time lowest.

I think I have learned my lesson now, don't show other people you want to become better. I usually do flashcards around 1,5 hours a day when I commute between work, and work waay more hours (because I feel like, I need to catch up)

I just have to meet up at the office for those exact 8 hours, not doing anything else that people can see.

If anyone actually reads this long ass random rant, I would love some advice for how to work in general, I sincerely think I'm doing it wrong.",1,1768622850.0,Accounting,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Carpet areas feel noticeably smaller (somewhere around \~35–40% less), yet pricing is still ₹11–12k/sq ft. Tiny balconies, limited balcony to balcony viewing space , and “livability” feels like it’s sacrificed unless you go ultra-luxury. Entire living pattern is dictated in this eco system especially for kids I personally feel.

So I’m exploring an alternative model I’ve seen in a few areas:

	•	\~2000 sq yards land

	•	16 flats total (4 flats per floor)

	•	1st floor: amenities (gym, coffee/lounge space, indoor games)

	•	Floors 2–5: homes designed for living (large deck balconies, work room, 3 bedrooms + flexible room like theatre/guest)

	•	Terrace: garden + solar

	•	Solar target: 5 kW per home → \~80 kW total for 16 flats

The goal is to have a high construction quality that lasts a generation and really functional for today’s use. 

Any thought on this , is this model of stand alone apartments donot work in Hyderabad. ",6,1768622617.0,hyderabadrealestate,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qf2y9q,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/2026/01/16/pasta-master,Sergio’s Pasta lets Winnipeg customers use their noodle to mix and match own meal,"The customer is always right… except when they’re wrong.

Garlic Soda, a website with the motto “weird name, great stories,” recently published a list of peculiar orders received by restaurant employees. The rundown included an ice-cream sundae smothered with ketchup, a bowl of blue-cheese dressing sans wings or salad, and 13 french fries, no more no less.

That takes us to Sergio’s Pasta, a weeks-old enterprise that invites diners to build their own meal for takeout or delivery by going online and selecting from among four varieties of fresh pasta, six in-house sauces, four proteins, eight vegetables and nine add-ons, such as chili oil and oregano.

Founder Serge Gregoire, who operates out of a commercial kitchen in southwest Winnipeg, reports that he hasn’t been tasked with preparing anything too outlandish yet, though there was one request he fielded a few days into the new year that gave him pause.

“Probably the wildest one so far was our Cheese Pull dish (four-cheese sauce topped with toasted breadcrumbs) with added pesto and tomato-basil sauce, sautéed mushrooms, Italian sausage, feta cheese and olives,” Gregoire says, seated in a Corydon Avenue coffee shop, 10 minutes from his home in Riverview.

“Honestly, it sounded pretty interesting — and smelled great, too — but it was the olives that ruined it for me, personally. I’m just not a fan. For the most part most, though, orders have been pretty normal, just adding some extra protein or cheese.”

Gregoire, 28, grew up in rural Manitoba, splitting time between his divorced mother’s home in the French-speaking community of Aubigny and his father’s fourth-generation grain farm near St. Jean Baptiste.

He was a Grade 12 student at L’École/Collège Régionale Gabrielle-Roy in Îles des Chênes when he was hired as a line cook at Moxies’ since-closed St. Vital Centre location. That job led to a similar position the following year, albeit in a more scenic setting than a suburban shopping mall.

“I moved to Whistler right after high school, where I did pretty basic stuff like burgers and chicken fingers at the Roundhouse Lodge, the restaurant at the top of Whistler Mountain,” says Gregoire, who spent his second year in the B.C. alpine resort toiling in the kitchen of the five-star Fairmont Chateau Whistler.

Gregoire, the second youngest of six siblings, returned home in 2020 to assist his father and an older brother on the farm. He headed west again 18 months later, this time to work at a liquefied natural-gas plant in northern B.C.

The pay was rewarding but the schedule — two weeks on followed by one week off, coupled with a lengthy commute from where he was living — left a lot to be desired.

“It reached the point where I started to question what I was doing. Why stay there working for somebody else, I asked myself, when I could be back here with my family, building toward something more meaningful?”

Not only did Gregoire fully commit to farming in 2023, he spent a good chunk of last winter in Australia, lending a hand on a 15,000-acre farm outside of Perth. The experience proved invaluable, he says, joking that probably the biggest difference between harvesting wheat Down Under versus the Prairies was watching kangaroos bound past his combine.

Gregoire took a roundabout route on his way back, stopping first in Karachi, Pakistan, to attend a pal’s wedding, before joining his girlfriend Kenzie in Paris. After a few days in the City of Lights, the couple travelled to Venice, Italy, which is where today’s story truly begins.

On their third day there, they were hunting for somewhere to stop for lunch after spending the morning visiting museums. They noticed a line stretching outside the door of a place called We Love Italy Fresh Pasta and, surmising that was probably a positive sign, joined the queue.

Upon entering, they discovered it was a takeout joint where customers could customize their meal by picking from an array of displayed noodles, sauces and proteins, in much the same manner as one orders a sandwich from Subway. They enjoyed the fare so much that they returned hours later to fetch dinner.

As they were lounging on the patio of their rental unit that night, polishing off the last of their selections, Gregoire openly wondered why there wasn’t something similar in Winnipeg — a fast-food spot with pasta as the star attraction. He proceeded to stay up late, brainstorming and typing notes into his phone. By the end of their stay, he’d convinced himself to “go for it,” figuring if he waited too long, another party would surely beat him to the punch.

Gregoire spent most of last spring developing sauce recipes with the help of his father’s partner Shelley Patel, a Red Seal chef who teaches a culinary course at Winkler’s Northlands Parkway Collegiate. After settling on four main ones, including garlic-Alfredo and Bolognese, they turned their attention to pasta.

Thanks to a high-end pasta extruder he imported from Europe, they were soon turning out expertly-made orecchiette, maccheronni-rigate, campanelle and penne noodles. He laughs, calling that a far cry from the leftover Chef Boyardee his mother used to pack for his grade-school lunches.

Gregoire’s plan was to open in late September, when activity on the farm would be winding down. Problem was, he couldn’t find a suitable locale that didn’t require months of renovations, time he simply didn’t have because of his farm duties.

At his realtor’s suggestion, in November he paid a visit to Winnipeg Ghost Kitchens on Lowson Crescent, a newish venture that rents out fully-licensed commercial-kitchen space on an hourly or monthly basis. The facility, a stone’s throw from Fort Garry Brewing on Kenaston Boulevard, turned out to be just what the doctor ordered.

“I’m in a shared kitchen but the other tenant and I are never there at the same time,” says Gregoire, whose official launch date was Dec. 4, a date he’ll remember owing to the fact he and his four-person staff, which for now includes his father Roland on dish duty, ran out of pasta two hours in — that’s how busy they were.

Sergio’s Pasta currently accepts orders Wednesday to Sunday, with Tuesdays reserved for prepping. (For a full list of hours and menu selections, go to sergiospasta.com.)

In addition to two sizes of pasta servings, both of which arrive in biodegradable containers, Gregoire also offers Caesar salad, garlic bread made fresh by Friend Bakery and Pizza on Osborne Street, and, for dessert, tiramisu.

He admits there will probably be long days ahead once the snow melts and seeding on the farm commences, only he’s never been one to shy away from hard work, he says. Plus, he has full confidence in his chum, co-chef and oft-Instagram foil Enzo Laterza.

“From time to time I may be forced to adopt a more managerial role but my intention is still to be here as much as possible,” he continues, noting he’s still keeping his eyes open for a standalone spot, preferably in his home neighbourhood of South Osborne, where he can ultimately market Sergio’s-branded sauces and fresh pasta, as well as accept catering assignments, another of his aims.

“It’s interesting because my parents were always encouraging me to think of a business I could do to keep myself occupied during the winter months, when I have time off,” he says, lamenting the fact he has had to put another of his interests, refinishing mid-century wood furniture, on the backburner.

“I’m not sure a restaurant is exactly what they had in mind, but because they’ve been so supportive, it’s given me the courage to know it’s all going to work out. I don’t have any doubts.”",9,1768622498.0,Winnipeg,1,1.0,False

1qf2xcs,https://i.redd.it/2qu4911f2udg1.png,"You Threw Me Out at Eight, Now I Hold Your Son's Fate!","Chapter 1  
  
  
On Christmas Eve, my stepmother threw my backpack out the door.  
  
  
""Get out of here! Go live with your grandma!""  
  
  
I was eight and all I could do was looking at dad, nervously.  
  
  
He just kept his head down, puffing on his cigarette.  
  
  
And just like that, I was kicked out of my own home.  
  
  
As I dragged my old suitcase downstairs, I heard my stepmother laugh to her son:  
  
  
""It's all yours now, baby.""  
  
  
My hand clenched the handle until it hurt.  
  
  
Twenty years later, all three of them showed up at my company. BEGGING ME.  
  
  
I stared at them. Smiled.  
  
  
Threw me out at eight? Now I HOLD YOUR FATE!  
  
  
...  
  
  
It was 2003, the summer I turned eight, when Dad got remarried.  
  
  
Her name was Caroline, and she had a six-year-old son named Jackson.  
  
  
At the wedding, she wore a white dress and spent the whole time smiling at everyone, touching Dad's arm, making sure people saw how perfect everything looked.  
  
  
When she got to me, she crouched down, ran her hand through my hair, and said, ""You can call me Mom now, sweetheart.""  
  
  
So I did. ""Mom.""  
  
  
She nodded, then turned right back to Jackson and pulled him close.  
  
  
I didn't think much of it at the time.  
  
  
I figured maybe this was just what having a real family felt like.  
  
  
My real mom died when I was two—Grandma said the pregnancy destroyed her body and she never recovered. After that, it was just Grandma raising me while Dad worked double shifts trying to keep us afloat.  
  
  
So when Caroline came into our lives, I thought maybe we'd finally have what other kids had.  
  
  
A real mom. A real home.  
  
  
Turns out I was wrong.  
  
  
Three days after the wedding, Caroline took down the family photo in the living room and put up a new one.  
  
  
Dad, her, and Jackson, all smiling together.  
  
  
I wasn't in it.  
  
  
""Why aren't I in the picture?"" I asked Dad.  
  
  
""We'll take a new one soon. You'll be in that one.""  
  
  
That never happened.  
  
  
But other things did start happening.  
  
  
Jackson's toys multiplied fast—action figures, race cars, building blocks spreading into every corner of the house.  
  
  
Mine got stuffed into the storage closet because they were ""making the place look messy.""  
  
  
Every night, Caroline cooked whatever Jackson wanted.  
  
  
Pot roast. Fried chicken. Mac and cheese loaded with butter.  
  
  
What about me?  
  
  
""Oh, you eat everything. You're not fussy.""  
  
  
I couldn't put it into words back then, but I knew something was off.  
  
  
Jackson got seconds while I barely got firsts.  
  
  
He could stay up watching TV while I had to be in bed by eight.  
  
  
When Jackson spilled juice all over the couch, Caroline laughed it off. When I accidentally dropped a glass, I stood facing the wall for two hours.  
  
  
I tried asking Dad about it once.  
  
  
""You're older,"" he said. ""You need to act like it.""  
  
  
Older.  
  
  
I was eight years old.  
  
  
A few months later, Jackson started first grade.  
  
  
That's when Caroline decided he needed the perfect study environment—quiet, bright, no distractions.  
  
  
Which, of course, meant my room.  
  
  
Mine had south-facing windows that let in tons of natural light and was tucked away from the street. Jackson's room faced the main road, where cars honked and engines revved at all hours.  
  
  
One afternoon, Caroline didn't even ask. She just told me.  
  
  
""Jackson's taking your room. You're switching with him.""  
  
  
I froze.  
  
  
That room had been mine my whole life. My mom's photo was still taped to the wall.  
  
  
""No,"" I said. ""That's my room.""  
  
  
Her expression turned ice cold.  
  
  
""Excuse me? You don't talk to me like that.""  
  
  
I looked at Dad, silently begging him to say something.  
  
  
He wouldn't even look at me. Just stared at the floor and mumbled, ""Do what she says.""  
  
  
That night, I packed up my things and moved into Jackson's old room.  
  
  
It was barely big enough for a bed and a desk, and the window had this gap that wouldn't close all the way. I already knew winter was going to suck.  
  
  
I carefully peeled my mom's photo off the wall and brought it with me. It was the only piece of her I had left.  
  
  
I thought that was it. But Caroline wasn't done.  
  
  
About a month later, she found me doing homework at the kitchen table.  
  
  
""So, I've been thinking,"" she started, leaning against the counter. ""This house only has three bedrooms, right? Your dad and I have ours, Jackson has his... There's just not enough room for everyone.""  
  
  
I looked up at her.  
  
  
""What are you saying?""  
  
  
""Well,"" she said, softening her voice in that fake way, ""your grandma lives alone. She could probably use the company. And honestly, you'd have more space there. It'd be better for everyone.""  
  
  
It took me a second to understand what she was actually saying.  
  
  
""You want me to leave?""  
  
  
""Not leave,"" she said quickly, waving her hand like I was overreacting. ""Just stay with your grandma for a while. You can still visit. Birthdays, holidays, whenever.""  
  
  
I turned toward the living room, where Dad was sitting on the couch.  
  
  
""Dad?""  
  
  
He kept his eyes on the TV.  
  
  
""Dad, please.""  
  
  
His jaw clenched. For a second, I thought he might actually say something. But then he just shook his head slightly.  
  
  
""Your mother's right.""  
  
  
That night, I couldn't sleep.  
  
  
I lay there listening to the cars passing by outside, the sound of my life falling apart one piece at a time.  
  
  
The next afternoon, I came home from school to find a new lock on my door.  
  
  
Caroline was standing in the hallway, dangling the key from her finger.  
  
  
""All packed,"" she said, nodding toward a small pink suitcase by the stairs. ""Your grandma's picking you up soon.""  
  
  
I stared at the suitcase. It used to be my mom's. Now everything I owned was crammed inside it.  
  
  
Dad was in the kitchen, holding his coffee mug with both hands, eyes locked on the floor.  
  
  
""Dad.""  
  
  
He didn't move.  
  
  
""Dad."" My voice cracked. ""Do you even want me here?""  
  
  
He finally looked up, and for half a second, something crossed his face. Guilt, regret.  
  
  
But mostly, he just looked exhausted.  
  
  
""Grandma will take good care of you,"" he said, barely above a whisper. ""I'll send money every month.""  
  
  
I didn't cry. I wouldn't give them that.  
  
  
I just stood there in the middle of the living room.  
  
  
Eight years in this house, and suddenly it felt like I didn't belong here.  
  
  
Caroline leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, a small smile tugging at her lips.  
  
  
Jackson peeked out from my old room, holding my little bear lamp—the one with the nightlight my mom gave me.  
  
  
""Mom, can I keep this? It's awesome!""  
  
  
""Sure, honey.""  
  
  
I wanted to march over there and take it back.  
  
  
But I didn't.  
  
  
Because somewhere deep down, I already knew—I didn't get to keep anything anymore.  
  
  
Grandma was waiting outside.  
  
  
When she saw me coming down the steps with that suitcase, her whole face just fell apart.  
  
  
She didn't say anything at first. Just pulled me into her arms and held on tight.  
  
  
""Let's go, baby,"" she whispered. ""Let's go home.""  
  
  
I nodded against her shoulder.  
  
  
We walked to her car together, and I didn't look back. But I heard it—the sound of the front door closing behind me.  
  
  
October 15th, 2003.  
  
  
That's the day I lost my home.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Grandma's place was in this run-down complex on the south side—two bedrooms, one bathroom, maybe 650 square feet if you were being generous.  
  
  
The building had seen better days.  
  
  
Paint peeling everywhere, radiators that coughed out lukewarm air even in the dead of winter.  
  
  
Still, she insisted I take the bigger room.  
  
  
""It's all yours, sweetheart,"" she said, squeezing my hand. ""You're home now.""  
  
  
When I walked in, I could tell she'd been preparing.  
  
  
Fresh sheets. A new lamp. Even a little plant on the windowsill trying its best to look cheerful.  
  
  
Grandma lived on Social Security—maybe eighteen hundred a month, if that.  
  
  
And she'd used it on me.  
  
  
That night, after the lights went out, I lay there staring at the ceiling until I couldn't hold it in anymore.  
  
  
I wasn't crying about Dad, or Caroline, or any of that.  
  
  
I was crying because of Grandma.  
  
  
She was in her mid-seventies. Her knees hurt when she walked. She had a pill organizer on the kitchen counter with three different prescriptions she took every single day.  
  
  
She should've been taking it easy. Going to bingo on Thursdays. Watching her shows.  
  
  
Not taking in an eight-year-old and starting all over again.  
  
  
""I'm sorry, Grandma,"" I whispered when she came to check on me.  
  
  
She sat down on the edge of the bed and started rubbing circles on my back, the way she used to when I was little.  
  
  
""Hey, none of that,"" she said softly. ""You're my girl. Always have been. Who else is gonna take care of you?""  
  
  
After that, living with Grandma just became normal.  
  
  
We found our routine fast enough.  
  
  
She'd walk me to school in the mornings, and I'd grab lunch in the cafeteria.  
  
  
By the time I got home, dinner would be waiting—whatever she'd thrown together that day.  
  
  
Her cooking wasn't anything special. Basic stuff.  
  
  
But it was hot and filling, and when I sat down to eat, I didn't have to worry about someone counting how many pieces I took.  
  
  
Dad said he'd send money every month to help out.  
  
  
First month, he sent $800.  
  
  
Second month, $500.  
  
  
Third month, nothing.  
  
  
Grandma tried calling Dad. Caroline picked up instead.  
  
  
""Oh, we wish we could help,"" Caroline said. ""But we're stretched pretty thin right now. Jackson's tutoring alone is eating up our budget. You understand.""  
  
  
Grandma's hand was shaking so bad she almost dropped the phone.  
  
  
""She's his daughter,"" Grandma said, her voice tight.  
  
  
""Sure. And she's living under your roof, eating your food."" Caroline didn't even try to sound nice anymore. ""So maybe you should be asking yourself why you're calling us for money.""  
  
  
The line went dead.  
  
  
Grandma just sat there on the couch, staring at the wall.  
  
  
I came out of my room and saw her wiping her eyes with the back of her hand.  
  
  
""It's okay, Grandma,"" I said, sitting down next to her and taking her hand. ""I don't want their money anyway.""  
  
  
""Oh, Dani...""  
  
  
""I'm serious."" I squeezed her hand tighter and looked right at her. ""When I grow up, I'm taking care of you. That's a promise.""  
  
  
I was eight years old.  
  
  
Even as I said it, I wasn't sure I could keep it. But I had to try.  
  
  
After that phone call with Caroline, the money stopped coming.  
  
  
Every few months, Dad might send something—a few hundred bucks, maybe—but there was no pattern to it. No way to count on it.  
  
  
Grandma never called to ask again.  
  
  
She made her Social Security stretch as far as humanly possible, took in sewing and alterations when neighbors needed help.  
  
  
Between that and her pension, we scraped by.  
  
  
That's when I started noticing things I'd been too little to understand before.  
  
  
Every piece of clothing she bought me was new. Meanwhile, everything in her closet looked like it survived the Cold War.  
  
  
When she cooked dinner, she'd load my plate with chicken or whatever protein she'd managed to find on sale, then sit down with just bread and steamed vegetables.  
  
  
Come winter, she'd pile two quilts on her bed and tough it out rather than bump the thermostat up even a degree.  
  
  
I saw all of it.  
  
  
But there wasn't much I could do except try not to be more of a burden than I already was.  
  
  
So I focused on school.  
  
  
I figured if I could just keep my grades up, work hard enough, maybe one day I'd be the one taking care of her for a change.  
  
  
That winter, a few days before Christmas, Dad called.  
  
  
""Hey, Dani. Why don't you come by for dinner on Christmas Eve?""  
  
  
I didn't want to go, but Grandma gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.  
  
  
""He's still your father, honey.""  
  
  
So I went.  
  
  
The second I walked through the door, I knew they'd been doing well for themselves.  
  
  
Everything looked different.  
  
  
Twinkling lights strung along the mantel.  
  
  
A massive Christmas tree in the corner, covered in ornaments and topped with a glittering star. New leather sectional. Thick carpet under my feet that definitely hadn't been there before.  
  
  
Jackson was stretched out on the couch wearing a puffy North Face jacket, hammering away at some handheld gaming thing.  
  
  
Caroline poked her head out from the kitchen.  
  
  
""Oh, you made it. Just grab a seat anywhere. Dinner'll be ready in a few.""  
  
  
When we sat down to eat, Caroline placed this massive platter of pot roast directly in front of Jackson.  
  
  
""Dig in, sweetie. I made your favorite.""  
  
  
Meanwhile, my plate got a spoonful of green beans and that was it.  
  
  
Dad glanced over and used his fork to move a single piece of meat onto my plate.  
  
  
One piece.  
  
  
By the time I finished mine, Jackson was going back for thirds.  
  
  
I kept my eyes on my plate the whole time, just eating and not saying anything.  
  
  
After dinner, Dad pulled out his wallet and counted out five hundred-dollar bills into my hand.  
  
  
""Get yourself some school supplies or whatever you need.""  
  
  
Five hundred bucks.  
  
  
I looked around the room.  
  
  
That enormous TV mounted on the wall had to be at least seventy inches.  
  
  
Jackson's gaming console sitting under it.  
  
  
The North Face jacket that still had the tags on it this morning.  
  
  
Those Jordans on his feet that I knew went for at least a hundred and fifty, maybe more.  
  
  
I folded the cash and shoved it in my pocket.  
  
  
Grandma's fridge was pretty much empty. This would help.  
  
  
""Thanks.""  
  
  
He reached over and messed up my hair. ""You just keep working hard in school, alright?""  
  
  
I stuck around for maybe two hours before I told them I needed to get back.  
  
  
Caroline walked me to the door, all smiles. ""Don't be a stranger, okay?""  
  
  
A stranger.  
  
  
Right.  
  
  
I started walking, and when I got to the corner, something made me look back.  
  
  
Through the living room window, I could see Jackson jumping around celebrating something while Caroline and Dad stood there laughing and cheering him on.  
  
  
The three of them looked perfect together.  
  
  
I turned away and kept walking.  
  
  
It was late December, and the air was so cold it hurt to breathe.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
The years blurred together after that.  
  
  
Elementary school. Middle school. High school.  
  
  
All of it spent in Grandma's tiny apartment.  
  
  
She gave me everything—every dollar she could spare, every bit of energy she had left.  
  
  
The only thing I could give her in return was good grades.  
  
  
So that's what I did. Stayed in the top ten all through middle school. Made it into honors classes when high school started.  
  
  
Every time I came home with a report card, her face would just glow.  
  
  
""There's my girl!"" she'd say, running her finger down the column of A's. ""Look at you go.""  
  
  
That report card might as well have been a trophy. She was so proud.  
  
  
During the summer, when the neighbors were out on their porches, I'd hear her through the window.  
  
  
""Dani's heading to college in a few years. Probably on scholarship, the way she's going.""  
  
  
Sometimes someone would ask, ""What about her dad? He chipping in?""  
  
  
Grandma's smile would falter for half a second.  
  
  
""Oh, you know. He does what he can. We see him at Christmas.""  
  
  
Christmas.  
  
  
Once a year. That was it.  
  
  
And every visit followed the same script.  
  
  
I'd show up, we'd eat dinner, Dad would slip me a couple hundred dollars, and then I'd leave.  
  
  
Caroline was always polite in that shallow, obligatory way—like I was some second cousin she had to be nice to at family gatherings.  
  
  
Jackson pretended I wasn't there. Wouldn't even make eye contact.  
  
  
Dad spent the whole time looking guilty, like he knew he was supposed to feel worse than he did. But guilt never translated into action.  
  
  
After a while, I stopped expecting anything.  
  
  
Stopped hoping things would change.  
  
  
When I started sophomore year, the school rolled out a new policy—everyone in my computer science class needed their own laptop.  
  
  
I didn't have one.  
  
  
Grandma had been tucking away bits of her Social Security for years.  
  
  
She'd managed to save around three thousand dollars, and the second I mentioned needing a computer, she was ready to hand it all over.  
  
  
I told her no.  
  
  
""Keep it, Grandma. I'll call Dad.""  
  
  
It was the first time I'd ever asked him for money directly.  
  
  
The phone rang. And rang.  
  
  
Finally, on the sixth or seventh ring, he picked up.  
  
  
""Dani? What's going on? You alright?""  
  
  
""Yeah. Listen, school's making us get laptops for class. I need about a thousand dollars.""  
  
  
Silence on the other end.  
  
  
""A thousand?""  
  
  
""Yeah.""  
  
  
He let out this long breath. ""Man, that's... really bad timing. We're in the middle of trying to figure out Jackson's tuition situation—he's applying to some private schools for next year, and those application fees alone are killing us...""  
  
  
My hand tightened around the phone.  
  
  
""Could you loan it to me? I'll pay you back.""  
  
  
""Loan?"" He sounded almost offended. ""Dani, you're my kid. I'm not saying no, it's just—money's really tight right now.""  
  
  
""When isn't it?""  
  
  
His voice went cold. ""Watch it. Your grandma gets a check every month, doesn't she? Have her front it for now, and I'll square up with you later.""  
  
  
Later.  
  
  
When I was little, it was always ""next time.""  
  
  
Now it was ""later.""  
  
  
I'd spent ten years waiting for ""next time.""  
  
  
""Forget it."" I hung up.  
  
  
That night, I told Grandma, ""I'll just use the computers in the lab at school. It's fine.""  
  
  
She didn't say anything. Just looked at me and sighed.  
  
  
The next day after school, I walked into the kitchen and stopped dead.  
  
  
There was a laptop sitting on the table.  
  
  
It was used but Grandma had gone around the neighborhood asking until she found someone willing to sell. Fifteen hundred dollars.  
  
  
""I know it's not brand new,"" she said, dabbing at her forehead with a dish towel. ""But it'll get you through your classes.""  
  
  
I couldn't take my eyes off it. The scuffed casing. The worn keys.  
  
  
Then I looked at her and noticed how thin her hair had gotten, how frail she looked standing there.  
  
  
Before I knew it, I was crying.  
  
  
""Grandma, you didn't have to—""  
  
  
""Hey, come on now."" She walked over and gently wiped my face with the edge of her sweater. ""You just focus on getting that degree. Seeing you graduate—that's everything to me.""  
  
  
By senior year, I'd pulled off decent SAT scores—good enough to land me at a state school about three hours away.  
  
  
Tuition was around six thousand a year, but once you factored in housing, meal plans, textbooks, all the random fees they hit you with—I was staring down nearly twenty thousand annually.  
  
  
Grandma's savings wouldn't even cover half of that.  
  
  
So I picked up the phone and called Dad.  
  
  
""I got accepted,"" I said when he answered. ""State university. Tuition's six grand a year.""  
  
  
There was a pause, and then I heard Caroline's voice in the background—not even trying to be subtle.  
  
  
""Six thousand dollars? Are you kidding me? We're barely scraping by as it is. Jackson's got two more years of high school, and God knows what college is going to cost us when he applies—""  
  
  
I cut her off. ""I wasn't asking you. I was talking to my dad.""  
  
  
""Oh, don't give me that.""  
  
  
Her voice went up an octave. ""His money is our money, and we don't have it. You've been living with your grandmother this whole time—if she wants you to go to college so bad, she can foot the bill.""  
  
  
I heard Dad mumble something I couldn't make out.  
  
  
Then he came back on, and he sounded tired.  
  
  
""Dani... look, just fill out the FAFSA, alright? See what kind of aid package you can get. I wish I could help, but right now I just... I can't.""  
  
  
\[I wish I could help.\]  
  
  
Sure he did.  
  
  
I didn't say anything. Just hung up.  
  
  
That summer, I filled out the FAFSA and managed to get approved for eight thousand in federal loans.  
  
  
For the rest, Grandma cleaned out her savings account—every penny she'd been setting aside for years.  
  
  
""Okay,"" she said, laying out the cash on the kitchen table and smoothing the wrinkled bills with her palm.  
  
  
""That'll get you through your first year. You go on to school now. I'll be right here waiting when you come home for breaks.""  
  
  
The day I left, Grandma insisted on riding the bus with me to the Greyhound station.  
  
  
When it was time to board, she stood behind the barrier, waving both hands over her head like she was trying to make sure I could still see her.  
  
  
""Work hard! And eat enough, you hear me?""  
  
  
I leaned out and shouted back, ""When I graduate, you're moving in with me. No arguments. You're retiring for real.""  
  
  
She was smiling, but her eyes were shining with tears she was trying not to let fall.  
  
  
I climbed onto the bus and grabbed a window seat.  
  
  
As we pulled out of the station, I pressed my hand against the glass and watched her figure shrink smaller and smaller until she disappeared completely.  
  
  
I didn't realize it at the time, that it would be the last time I'd see her standing there.

Woke up at 3am, intense lower back pain, thought I pulled something, got progressively worse and worse, within 30 minutes I’m curled up in agony vomiting and shaking. I was alone at the time and had to drive myself to the ER. I had to stop on a busy road to vomit out my door (luckily it was 4 in the morning and there were no cars).

I had no idea what was wrong with me, I thought I was just dying tbh. The thought that I would have a kidney stone never crossed my mind.

I had a 3mm stone that put me through a month of absolute hell. I just can’t imagine going through it again.

Since this happened I’ve learned a lot about stones and even had mine examined. It’s a classic calcium oxalate stone, my diet wasn’t particularly high in oxolates but was probably overdoing the sodium. Though, by far the biggest issue was my lack of water consumption (and too much coffee). I would simply…never drink water. I’d go for coffee in the mornings and tea/ juices all day.

I’ve gotten much better about water compared to how awful it was before but most of what I read says I should be drinking 2.5-3.5 L of water every day? That just seems impossible to me and a huge hassle. I would have to FORCE myself to drink that much and it makes me mad because I know nobody in my life is drinking that much water every day but I’m the only person in my family to ever get a stone.

Idk, I just want to rant a bit.

I do have some questions for other stone makers.

Firstly, those who have had one stone only and not had another yet, what did you change to prevent things? I know nothing is ever guaranteed. That’s what makes me so afraid :(

I mentioned I had a 3mm stone that out me through the worst pain of my life, but I have some people talk about passing 5-7mm with little pain? What can make some stones easier or harder to pass.

Lastly, and maybe most importantly, the biggest issue I deal with is anxiety around stone formation. I have posture/back problems and every time I feel a sharp pain or spasm in my lower right side i immediately think this is it and I panic. Are there any pains that can indicate a stone forming or moving? Or do you just know when it already too late?",1,1768622227.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

1qf2p9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheyVotedFor/comments/1qf2p9i/i_voted_for_trump/,I voted for Trump,"I realize this is long. I just ask that you please read and know this is something I felt needed to be shared. Thank you so much for your time. I like to think of myself as more independent than affiliated with any party. I have voted democrat and I have voted republican. Both sides have their pros and cons. I would argue that I’m conservative in the way that means small government, individual liberty,  less taxes, and I have a strong distrust of the government.

I’m from the south. I grew up with parents that taught me the values I saw reflected in our neighbors, teachers, church members, etc. I saw some adults in my life treat others in ways that were not acceptable but I’ve always believed with each generation we get closer to treating all people with dignity. Things change in the south slowly. Some of these ideals have been ingrained in these people in ways that nothing short of death will end. Naturally, of course, but again, each generation hopefully learns from the past and gets better. We ignore the dark side of these people. So and so’s grandpa is so nice but you’ll just have to overlook the occasional racist comment. So and so gave me a good job but you just have to zone out when he starts making inappropriate comments about women’s bodies, he means well. Don’t worry about the fact another employer only hires white people, they pay great money and benefits. It’s not just for trump that we come up with excuses. We drive by the project housing and think those people are there because they don’t want a place with responsible and hardworking society.

We didn’t have lots of money but my parents both worked. We were blessed to have our grandmother living with us to help with childcare. Widowed by my dairy farmer grandfather, she retired as a Walmart cashier. She had to live with us as her social security and benefits were not enough to even cover her monthly medications. This was extra handy when my parents divorced. My mother was then responsible for our entire care with no help from my father. We received food stamps at this time. My dad became disabled after a fall and a MS diagnosis and disability left him living in a camper on a friend’s property as his only option. He lived with family sometimes. My mom struggled for a while and then she remarried. Things got easier because this man was a business owner with the “right” last name in small town USA. He ended up leaving her after a few years for a woman 30 years younger than her. His best friend’s 21 year old daughter and he was in his 50’s. He was a “good” Christian man and respected by his community. By this point I’m an adult. A millennial entering the work force and hoping with hard work and dedication I can make something of myself. I started a job in the big city nearby the year I graduated high school. I’m dropped in a training class that’s 90% black with several gay people. It was a culture shock at first. I didn’t know that I could fit in such a place.

Then the craziest thing happened. I became best friends with a black, gay woman. I met her family and instantly felt like I’d found my people. All of a sudden it felt weird that I was never around these kinds of people before. Segregation may have ended long ago but in the south, in the Bible Belt, it’s still very much alive. Much like cliques in high school, people pretty much hang with their own kind here. I left that job but kept my friendship to this day. We aren’t close anymore but I’ll always adore her and her family. She opened my eyes to the world.  She taught me an important lesson but still wasn’t enough to change my thought process all the way. I think just accepting her for who she is wasn’t enough now. Not standing up more for her rights by paying attention to the political climate and voting in a way that made her and every human’s life better was a disservice of that friendship. I sympathized but didn’t empathize.

Then 2008 hits and boom it’s a recession. I think we can all agree that was Bush’s fault but everyone said Obama made it worse. I voted for Obama the first time. I was loud and proud about it no matter what my friends and neighbors had to say. I felt like I was part of a movement. The first black president means we are capable of anything now. We aren’t limiting ourselves to the same face different name every election. But this impatient young adult didn’t feel like Obama made much of a difference in my life. The news channels we are loyal to, the famous people, our friends, our parents, are all loud about how much of a mistake it was voting Obama in. I live in the country. Most policies seemed to benefit the big city but didn’t seem as logical in rural areas. It seemed like maybe I had made a mistake. I don’t think I even voted in Obama’s second election. I’ve never liked Romney and did not have a huge opinion either way for that election. I am jaded at this point and believe both sides will say whatever they want to get a vote.

I’ve worked with people of many different backgrounds and races since and I’ve always tried to treat each person with the same respect. I don’t base any of my political beliefs on race, religion, or sexuality. People are people and we all have the right to exist. Except pedophiles but that’s a whole different discussion. We all have the right to marry the person we love. We all have the right to adopt a child or be called the name we go by. We all have the right to feel comfortable in our own bodies. At some point I quit caring what the politician I support believes about any of those issues. I ignorantly believed that we are progressive, civilized people and we wouldn’t ever backtrack on human rights.

Trump did okay his first run. I voted for him on his second run and when he didn’t win, I understood that the people have spoken. Doesn’t matter who I voted for. Trump cried about election fraud but I understood this to be the rantings of someone who lost a race. I did not feel he “drained the swamp” but hoped if he were reelected, he would continue that quest. I didn’t hear much about 1/6. I thought what they did was wrong and not a correctly enacted display of protest. There was no outrage on our side of the media wall.

Government corruption and greed are the biggest threats to democracy to me. I listen to conspiracy theories and really think there’s merit to some of them. Biden enters the picture and this guy seems like he should have retired years ago. I heard some old recordings of him talking about segregation in derogatory terms. He’s a career politician. Prices went sky high for everything. Covid happened. Some of these things aren’t his fault but it’s unfortunate timing. Then on top of that, I had a new career I was excited about. I’d mostly only had jobs before then so I was hopeful for a future there. Then in 2021 my employer announces that we would all be required to take the Covid shot within two weeks or we would be let go. This is in Florida, which is an at will state. The news channel that I watch, the people on tv and radio, my family and friends, all telling us not to get the shot. I believe this was for boosters and so you have people saying the injections caused horrible side effects. You had people saying hospitals are putting Covid down fraudulently as cause of death for folks in an attempt to take government money. I got covid in December of 2019. It was bad but I’ve had the flu before and to me, they were the same. I mentioned my tendencies to believe conspiracy theories, right? Y’all politicized the HELL out of covid! Both sides, right and left. The left with this dr fauci who is making so much money off of this pandemic through big pharma. The right with their horse worm meds. So when my employer, who in my eyes has absolutely NO right to involve themselves with my medical care, tells me that I’m just fired if I don’t comply, well it validated everything the conservatives were trying to tell me.

I’m a millennial who was already fucked over by a recession. I live in a state where minimum wage is $7.25 (still even now) AND we have to pay state income taxes here as well! I didn’t go to college because I enjoyed my teenage years a little too much and then recognized student loans are just a lifelong trap. I knew people with degrees that made less than me at the time. So I putt along for a few years riding with Biden. My $ don’t go as far. Then here comes Trump again. The guy that isn’t going to bow to special interest groups and lobbyists. He is such a bully that he promises to out bully the other bullies and get our country on the right track. The economy seemed to be coming back around at the end of his first term. He has so much money that there’s no way he needs to be corrupt like those other career politicians.

I may cringe when I hear him speak like he’s a 5 year old with an ego the size of Texas. I may think it’s embarrassing to hear him ramble on the world stage about god know what, not even him. I may think he is a little mean to journalists and other politicians. But he is the best chance we got. Harris is the best the democrats have to offer and even many of them don’t support her.

The things I really remember hearing about Kamala the most is that she rode the coattails of men her whole life. Her professor, Biden, etc. The kind of hateful rhetoric that breaks down a woman’s whole life in a way that is meant to show her as weak and undeserving. I didn’t even realize I engaged in politically slut shaming a fine American for things that I never bothered to even find out if were true or not. She was a prosecutor is her day and to me they haven’t always been the “good guy”. I discounted her completely. I thought what my neighbors and friends thought, it’s finally our time. Things are going to change and maybe the millennials will get another fresh start.

He is going to stop these illegal immigrants, who are mostly criminals fleeing from justice to our country, from not paying taxes and getting free healthcare. I’m a citizen and I don’t get those perks so I do not think anyone else should, especially criminals. In 2020 I had a job where illegal immigrants were employed as contractors to do jobs. I didnt see them much in the office, we just dispatched them to jobs. I know some were illegal as sometimes we ran into issues where they could not enter a gated community as they had no form of identification. I did not have any issues with these people but I did recognize they probably are not paying taxes.

In my world, I give a third or more of my paycheck away for taxes. I think American citizens are overtaxed. I appreciate the social services that come with taxes but just like anything else handled by the government, it could be done better and cheaper. Let us pay taxes a year in advance and invest our money. Theoretically, we could never have to be taxed again if handled correctly. Or with luck. That’s just an example but I know there are many people out there smarter than I am that could find other solutions.

We are taught early that there are lazy people who benefit off the backs of hardworking Americans. That’s where all of our taxes go, to support others who have the thing we are envious of the most. Free time. We have to sacrifice ours and these people are out living their best life. Eating steaks and sugary snacks with their food stamps. The audacity.

In reality, such a small portion of your taxes go to providing people in need with basic human rights like food and shelter. These same people that have used social services at some point in their lives are upset your toddler got Oreos instead of bland ass Cheerios. Because for some reason your kid doesn’t deserve a treat sometimes.

Trump gets elected and nothing really changes for us. We know it takes time to fix an economy after going in behind such “poor leadership” so none of us are upset. Trump is working hard day and night to get us back on track. We just have to hang on a little longer. He is going to cut taxes on overtime.

I spent a lot of time in the church as a kid. Southern Baptist to be exact. I was the perfect little christian. I remember being reprimanded for answering too many questions in bible school. Give someone else a chance they’d have to tell me time and again. I was an eager student. Rather for knowledge or acceptance into a group I’m not sure. These Godly people who have been telling me what’s right from wrong my whole life believe this president is a good, Christian man. The crazy liberals would do absolutely anything to stop this man. Even lie about him being a pedophile! I’m sorry, but no way my mom would support a pedophile!!!

Things started feeling off to me about half way through the first year. All of a sudden Israel and Palestine are in the news. I do not watch news programs often because I believe the news is so biased on both sides that it’s a waste of time. I’m not a watcher of tv to begin with. I prefer easy to watch shows like my name is earl or MASH. You can miss 5 episodes and it doesn’t matter. News channels leave me with more questions than answers. Why is it that I can watch a report on the same thing from two different outlets and have two very different understandings of the subject? At this stage of my life I’m a Christian but not practicing. No church or anything because that’s a little too social for me. But I try to be a good person with hope that one day I will be reunited with my family and friends that precedes me in death. I think a big part of being Christian is the fear of what if. What if the bible tells the truth and I go to hell? The idea that the bible was created as a way to keep man in line seems pretty legit to me. Christians are taught that Jews are Jesus’ chosen people. It doesn’t make sense why but I’ve always been taught that. I do not know any Jewish people but Adam Sandler is pretty freaking awesome. The Hanukkah song and 8 crazy nights.

Well the news is showing these people killing and starving women and children. The more I learned about this situation the more devastated I became. Through our presidents, republican and democrat alike, we have been funding a genocide. I’m watching people be detained and forced to watch a propaganda video when they are only bringing food and baby formula to these people. I’m watching Israel’s prime minister do despicable things a group of people weaker than them. I’m watching the underdogs, a group of people the world sold out after WW2, just try to make the best of the lot in life they have been given. I’m watching Israelis destroy farms and olive trees, spill needed water while those they persecute are forced to watch. I see hope fading from their eyes. From their oldest to their very youngest.

I see these things and decide to start conversations with the people around me. Surely my friends and family and neighbors will think this is wrong. I could not have been farther from the truth. People looked at me funny. They said hateful things like well they’re all a bunch of terrorists anyway. The women and children are aiding them. Or they’re just an unfortunate price to pay to end terrorism. I couldn’t believe the hate spewing from these people I respected. I felt abandoned. Cut adrift from everything I thought I knew. These are people I’ve watched give the shirt off their backs to help their friends and neighbors. Good Christians who go to church and pay tithes. Pillars of the community.

They spoke about these people as if they were already obliterated. I think I was in shock for some time. I had already known Christians weren’t perfect. Many people in church are there for the wrong reasons and nobody will EVER judge you the way christians do. But I thought they would have some compassion for people especially in this extreme circumstance.

I decided to go down this wormhole and figure out how this had happened. I found out that Israel owns most of congress. I have never been more disappointed in an administration in my lifetime. Trump not only bows to these billionaires and special interest groups, he treats Israeli leadership like royalty!!

I cannot give you an acceptable answer about why I practiced lazy politics before this. As a privileged member of society I guess I just never had the immediate need to stop some injustice from happening to me. I’ve never been more ashamed in my life. Every vote, every time I voiced my uneducated opinions. I cannot undo any of that. All I can do is share my story and advocate for the right people now. This is in no way meant to excuse anything. But if I reach a few others like myself, seekers of truth and justice that just need a reality check, then maybe we could make a difference.

Then the ICE raids start. There has been an ice processing facility attached to our prison here in town for many years. It’s a normal thing in our community. You don’t hear much from that facility and it is considered a good job here. So the name ICE isn’t scary here unless you have to work in a restaurant that deals with their asshole guards. They are legit the worst customers in town! To be honest, I didn’t hear much about people being deported until recently. We took a vacation to TX and NM for Christmas break. I worried that we may see some things there but it was just a few border patrol stops here and there. We were waved right through most with 1 chitchatting and asking about how we liked the national park. They were friendly enough and surprisingly Latino. We get back from our trip and we are hearing some things. I didn’t have any idea who Kristi Noem was at the beginning of January 2026. That changed very quickly.

Even coming from my conservative background I knew that the people following ice around were true American heros. Holding Ice agents to some accountability sounded like a smart idea. By this time I’m already feeling pretty anti Trump over the files and his general attitude. Like many Americans though I figured we would get through these next 3 years and hopefully a better candidate presents themselves, either party. I’m more concerned with voting for someone that stands up to Israel. That has not sold their position and power to someone thousands of miles away, progressively and geographically. That has not accepted money from AIPAC.

We met some very nice people on our trip that were pretty vocal about their disdain for Trump and it felt amazing that for once I didn’t feel I had to defend this man. Republicans will not admit this but it is exhausting defending him. That’s because there is no defense for his actions. It was freeing.

Then Renee Good was murdered. I watched this video that was everywhere all of a sudden and my heart hurt. I felt instant anger. Then I watched my government, Noem and Trump tell me this woman is a domestic terrorist. They said the ice agents were stuck in the snow and this woman went after them. Viciously attacked them. I was stunned as I had watched a short clip of the video BEFORE seeing Kristi Noem go in front of America and LIE!! Then I saw the whole clip. I realized immediately what the problem is.

Renee Good represents the thing that for some reason scares republican men more than ANYTHING else. A gay woman that doesn’t respect their inherent authority. Gay women don’t pander to straight alphas. They don’t want their attention. They say what they want and steal their girlfriends. They have their own thoughts and ideas. I know so many men that give respect to most all people but hate a blue haired lesbian more than the devil himself. Maybe she represents the downfall of man. Maybe they don’t like the idea that somewhere out there is a woman more “manly” than they are. I do not know for sure why. Maybe it’s not the gay part so much as it is the strong women that stand up to them. Whatever the reason, I have seen men gatekeep women my whole life. When Renee’s wife made that ice agent feel like a clown, and rightly so, he decided right then to do something.

When trying to have more open conversations with my coworkers about this, I was sent a newsmax (go figure!) video where the anchors broke it down like an NFL football game. They just straight up said whatever the hell they wanted and KNEW MAGA would comply with their rhetoric. We live in a time where they can say whatever they want and they know there will be no questions. There will be no debates, no investigations. We said this is how it happened and so it is. At one point the anchor mansplained how the “officer” HAD to move to the front of her vehicle, as standing where he was, to the side, would have left him in the line of a bullet if they needed to shoot inside the vehicle. Like, that’s an actual game plan? Two unarmed women recording you and you need to plan out your assault.

Then I was told by more christians that she deserved to die. That she is a criminal and the poor “OFFICER” was almost killed in the line of duty. Basically, christians took that opportunity to reiterate how much better they are than anybody else. That bad things happen to people who deserve it.

Since then I have been watching videos of absolute rock stars out there fighting the good fight. I see people of all color and backgrounds coming together to give their neighbors an extra minute or two’s notice before their rights are ran over by the ice bus. They see people being manhandled, kidnapped, stolen in the night and they are recording and speaking from their hearts about it. They watch children having tactical grenades tossed at them. They watch children get deported to countries their parents have never even seen or lived in. Or come home from school to their family being gone. Just gone. They watch knowing they cannot help them once they are taken away because our government, our congress, has already failed them and will not lift a finger to abolish ice.

Kristi Noem has about as much understanding of and respect for our constitution as Donald Trump does. She doesn’t care that she is treading all over civil rights. She doesn’t care that she is undoing hundreds of years of progress that many people dedicated their lives to pursuing for the American people. Many who died to bring to reality. She doesn’t care.

Republicans are so quick to quote the constitution. But they are very much like christians, they pick the parts they like and that apply to them and throw out the rest. I have been taught to vote against my own best interests my whole entire life. Who wouldn’t be embarrassed that you were duped so easily. It’s a tough conversation to have with yourself but impossible for some to have openly. Stop voting against your own best interest just to satisfy someone else, just to gain acceptance in a club that doesn’t want you. They just need to use you for a bit. Stop protecting billionaires, they don’t need your charity. Your neighbors do. The ones that not only know how much a gallon of milk costs, they also understand the value of that amount of money. They know what it’s like to have to decide between a cup of fru fru coffee as a treat to themselves or having gas to get to work.

If I’ve offended you or your religion or your political beliefs with any of this, well I guess I don’t really care. YOU radicalized me. YOU made me “woke”. If your goal is to bring as many to Christ in life as you can then you should fix yourself first. Good people will not respect injustice, they will not tolerate intolerance. They will not embrace hate wrapped in judgement. YOU radicalized me and I know I cannot be the only one you did that to.",4,1768621817.0,WhatTheyVotedFor,2,0.75,False
1qf2mix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1qf2mix/i_was_labelled_a_red_4/,I was labelled a red (4),"Fuller stepped towards Nick. 

It was the first time I’d seen him as a commander, not a teacher.

“I said, stand up *straight*, soldier.”

“What a fucking asshole,” the guy holding me hissed. His body went rigid when Nick obeyed, his palm pressing harder over my mouth, like he knew I was about to lose it. 

I forced myself still, swallowing the urge to squeeze my eyes shut.

Nick stood motionless, arms by his sides, staring straight ahead into nothing. When Fuller pulled out a crumpled tissue to wipe the boy’s bloody nose, my stomach turned. 

That smug, triumphant look, the same one he always wore in class contorted his expression. 

He circled Nick like a predator, inspecting every inch of him.

Nick trembled, eyes flickering, lips quivering, whatever humanity was left inside him was slipping away. 

Fuller didn’t care.

“You’re a fighter, aren’t you?” he said, almost amused.

The man chuckled. “Even while suffering the first signs of defection, what appears to be a hemorrhage, you’re still standing. Impressive.”

Nick didn’t respond. I watched rivulets of red trail down the curve of his throat.

“One of our strongest minds,” Fuller said, pride swelling in his voice. 

He turned to the soldier beside him. 

“This boy marks the beginning of something extraordinary. I want every defective recruit that’s still breathing brought in. He’s part of a batch with potential. Proof lies in his resilience, his ability to withstand defection.”

He shoved Nick, but my friend didn’t even flinch.

“If processing failed the first time, we’ll keep at it until it doesn’t. Recruit 13 is an anomaly we welcome. Run another cleanse to make sure the former personality has been fully erased.”

“Yes, sir.” The soldier nodded.

Fuller folded his arms, narrowing his eyes at Nick. “Recruit 13. How are you feeling right now?”

“I feel nothing,” Nick said flatly.

“Uh-huh.” Fuller stepped closer, until they were almost touching. “What about thoughts? Anyone come to mind? Friends? Family? You were quite vocal before we purged that personality. Do you still want to tear me apart, Nicholas?” 

His tone turned mocking. “What was it you said when I strapped you down and gave you anesthesia you didn’t deserve? Ah, yes. You were going to rip out my eyes, stick them up my ass, and make me eat them.”

A sick satisfaction gleamed in his eyes. He knew Nick would obey now, no matter what. Fuller shoved him back again.

“Such a sharp tongue, Nicholas,” he sneered. “I hope you know I enjoyed severing it from your filthy mouth.” 

He leaned in, voice low and cruel. 

“And I enjoyed stripping every independent thought that ever dared bloom in that hollow brain of yours.” 

Fuller tapped Nick’s head with a smile. “You were born to be an Aceville soldier. And might I say, you’re my favorite one yet.”

The teacher seemed to revel in antagonizing the boy, yet I couldn’t ignore the flicker of urgency in his tone. 

He wasn’t just enjoying the power he held over Nick, he was ensuring that every trace of the boy was erased.

“I said speak!” he snapped.

Nick answered through a mouthful of glistening, pooling red. “I have no thoughts, sir.”

Fuller’s grin made my stomach turn. “Does the name Benjamin Castor mean anything to you?” 

This time he leaned in uncomfortably close. 

The real Nick would have spat in his face. 

“Your father hated you from the start,” he murmured. “As for your mother, the moment you were born, we slaughtered and then incinerated her.” He stepped back. 

“Beth wasn’t on the same page as us. I worked with her. Agent Carter was one of our best. She could put a bullet in any kid’s skull without hesitation, but somehow, we lost her to you.” 

Fuller’s lip curled in disgust. “That’s right. Beth bonded with you while you were still inside her. I’d never seen anything like it. She actually cared for you, the genetically modified fetus we implanted in her. She saw you as more than a tool, more than a cog in our machine. She saw you as her son.”

He sneered. “A shame you survived the programming. Mother and son could have been reunited, the traitor and her failed experiment.”

My teacher’s words cut deep. Nick’s hope had been to meet the mother he never knew. 

Fuller wanted to see if any part of him would break, if anything remained to purge. 

He shoved Nick, but Nick didn’t budge. “You weren’t even born yet, and somehow you managed to turn one of our own against us.” 

His laugh was sharp and bitter. “And what about Elizabeth Carter, your pathetic mother, who let emotion get the better of her and paid for it with her blood?""

“I feel nothing,” Nick said.

But I caught it, the hesitation, the small pause between his words.

Fuller didn’t notice. He straightened, giving a satisfied nod.

“Interesting. I thought some part of him might hold on, maybe wouldn't be affected by the new serum. But recruit 13 is empty. He’s defecting. Which means he needs to be processed immediately.”

His brows pinched. Then he twisted and swung a punch at Nick’s face.

I expected his fist to land and Nick to hit the ground, but my friend moved faster than I’d ever seen, springing to life. Only it wasn’t the kind of awareness I wanted. 

It was whatever they had put inside him, the so-called sleeper, triggered by a direct attack. Nick was quick, his face blank as he ducked and grabbed the instructor by the neck, lifting him clean off the floor.

It didn’t seem real. Just weeks ago, Nick could barely carry me for a piggyback ride. 

Now he was something else entirely, exactly what Fuller wanted him to be. The man let out a shriek of laughter, a grin spreading across his face.

“Yep,” said the guy holding me, pulling me down behind a tree. I could smell the metal from his gun as it brushed my ear. “Fuller’s just as batshit crazy as I remember, and he calls himself an agent?”

“Fascinating!” My teacher, still in Nick’s stranglehold, choked out. “This one is defecting, and his reaction times are perfect!”

He barked at Nick to let him go, and the boy’s grip around his neck loosened, allowing him to hit the ground. The teacher was barely fazed before going in again. 

This time, he went for the kill, shoving the boy backward with one hand while reaching into his jeans with the other to pull out his glock. 

Again, it was like watching a movie. 

With vacant eyes and movements driven purely by reflex, Nick disarmed the weapon, slammed the teacher to the ground, and pressed the barrel into the back of his skull.

The teacher was playing with his toy. 

Next, Nick was ordered to disarm another soldier, this time without using his hands. To my shock, he managed it. With a simple jerk of his hand, the magnum slammed into the flesh of his palm.

As if driven by an invisible force.

“Okay, you’ve got to admit, that’s impressive,” the British guy whispered. “They must have upgraded the specs. I’m pretty sure our class never got whatever I’m looking at.”

After a moment, Fuller composed himself. “If his brain can submit again, and we manage to preserve the body, we’ve struck gold with this year’s recruits.” He straightened his jacket.

“Yes, we may have lost many due to errors,” he continued, eyes gleaming, “but our survivors? Look at them! I’ve never seen strength and reaction times like this, not to mention psychic abilities on par with our 2018 class. If we can capture every defector still breathing and reprogram them, this year will be our best yet. Nicholas is living proof.”

The boy holding me groaned. “Yeah, I’m not listening to this shit. That man is a psycho.”

When he dragged me back, my body reacted automatically. 

“No!” I tried to scream into his hand, but he was too fast.

I wanted to say I wouldn’t leave Nick to that fate again, but his hold on me was impossible to break. 

He pulled me into the trees once more. Twisting my head, I caught a glimpse of Nick being led away with the others. 

I struggled all the way to the clearing, where he finally dropped me into a heap before letting out an exasperated breath.

I hit the ground face first, getting a mouthful of dirt and leaves.

When I lifted my head, a familiar blur of golden curls lay next to me. Bobby. She was on her back, eyes shut peacefully, scarlet trails staining her chin.

Bobby was still defecting.

“Sam.”

A familiar voice sounded, like wind chimes. “You don’t have to be so rough.”

When I glanced up, the blonde I thought I’d hallucinated earlier was standing over me. 

Her face was unmistakable, pretty features carved into perfect, porcelain skin that was paler, a lot paler. 

She looked older, though only by a few years, early twenties maybe.

Her hair fell in unbrushed ringlets that she had to sweep out of her eyes, no longer in the childish ponytail I remembered from all those years ago. 

I was still seeing her younger self.

I had never forgotten her, Clara Danvers, sprinting across rough tarmac, frenzied, wide eyes. Those eyes had once been full of childlike fear. When I looked into them now, they were hollow, haunted.

For a moment, I was caught between wrapping my arms around the girl I’d thought was dead and jumping up to grab Bobby and run back to Nick. I needed to know he was okay. To know that he truly had been hesitating. That he was still in there somewhere.

I was shaking when the girl loomed over me, her arms crossed over a ratty jacket. She moved slowly, like I was a rabid animal. I wanted to scream at her and the guy for taking me away from Nick. But before I could, she held out a hand for me to grab.

Clara’s smile was kind. “You’re Adeline, right?”

I managed to nod, letting her pull me to my feet.

In the dim light of the afternoon bleeding through the trees, I could finally see the guy. 

I could tell just by looking at him that his younger self had been on the varsity team. Sam was an older version of Nick, with the same hollow eyes as Clara that aged him well past twenty-two. 

Blinking rapidly through the rays of sunlight seeping through the trees, I glimpsed short reddish curls slipping from beneath a baseball cap. 

His features were kind, though a sardonic twist lingered in his lips. 

I could tell that, once, this boy had laughed. Maybe even been the class joker.

It was hard to look at him without noticing the gnarly scar that sliced below his left eye and cut across his nose. 

He lifted a hand in a sarcastic wave. “Thanks for biting me,” he muttered. Sam’s British accent was a lot stronger now that he wasn’t whispering. “Twice.”

Ignoring him, I shuffled over to Bobby. Her nosebleed was getting worse, I thought, and I knew what that led to. 

But when I gingerly grazed the tips of my fingers under my own nose, I realized I was no longer bleeding. Not just that, the thunderclap headaches that had sent my thoughts spiraling were gone.

When I crouched in the dirt and pulled Bobby to my chest, Clara knelt beside me. “I’d keep your distance,” she said softly. “Right now, that’s not who you think it is.”

I got to my feet, struggling to stay upright. “Then who, or what, is she?”

“Right now?” Sam shrugged. “A defecting soldier.” He jutted his chin. “Just like your mate.”

“No,” I said, even when yes burned on my tongue. “No, she wouldn’t—”

“He’s right, Adeline,” Clara murmured. When I turned to look at her, her smile had curved into a frown. She folded her arms across her chest. “You need to understand that right now, that isn’t Robyn Atwood. At least, it won’t be until she dies.”

“What?” I whispered, a chill creeping down my spine. “What are you talking about?”

The two of them exchanged glances, and after what looked like a telepathic conversation between them, Clara sighed.

“Adeline, she’s going to be okay,” she said softly. “As long as her Zero is active, she’s fine.”

My hand grazed the back of my neck, and I was reminded of the thing inside me.

Mr. Fuller had called it that, a Zero. Whatever was inside Nick and Bobby. The entirety of my class.

Sam groaned and flopped onto the ground, picking up a stick and snapping it in half. 

Pulling resting his head in his arms, he sighed, a small, unguarded gesture that revealed the boy still inside him, the one who had been forced to grow up too fast. 

“Oh, boy.” Sam shot Clara a crooked smile, resting his chin on his knee. “You're better at explaining. You know I suck at describing shit.” 

Clara nodded. “Fine.” 

She plopped down next to him, her dark brown eyes tracing the sky above us, distant and wistful. 

“I guess we should start from the beginning.” 

Her smile was bright, but her eyes betrayed her; she did not want to revisit what came next. 

“Like you, Adeline,” she said quietly, “I was a defect.”

She tilted her chin toward Sam. “We both were. They said my brain couldn’t handle it.”

The bottom dropped out of my stomach. Suddenly I was back in the facility, my head pounding, blood dripping down my chin, my hand tangled in Nick’s. 

*Her brain couldn’t handle it*, Mr. Fuller had said with that smug smile.

Clara’s throat-clearing snapped me back. Her eyes had darkened. 

Her head tipped back,  gaze flicking to the cloudless sky. “You already know the gist of it, so I won’t go into detail. Mr Fuller, my mother, and everyone I've ever known…” she sniffled, squeezing her eyes shut. “They killed my friends.” 

Her voice wavered. “There were thirty-six seniors in our class, and we’re the only ones who made it out.”

She steepled her fingers, a small, habitual motion that looked like something she did to keep herself from falling apart. Clara was her own anchor. 

She pulled her knees to her chest, all of her trembling, like she was back there. 

“They lined us up. Like you, we were just kids thinking we were at some kind of summer camp.” She shot me a grin. “I saw you that day.” Clara’s eyes filled with tears. 

“Adeline Calstone watching me from the shadows. I didn't want to scare you. You were a kid, and I guess…” Clara let out a breath. “I guess part of me figured maybe summer camp wouldn't be so bad.” 

I revelled in the way she held herself together; a paper doll, fragile, fraying at the edges. But refusing to tear. “So, I let the teacher grab me.”

For a moment, I thought she would manage to tell her story without breaking.

“I had a boyfriend,” Clara whispered. Her eyes were faraway again. Lingering on the trees. “His name was Jonas.” Clara's tone splintered, breaking into a hiss. 

“He was standing next to me. Jonas, my first love. My first kiss. He was my first everything. We planned to take a year out, travel the world. See every country. Make memories before going to college on opposite sides of the world.” 

Clara exhaled shakily. “I didn’t even have time to process it. One moment, Jonas had his arms around me, promising we’d escape. His head was on my shoulder, and he was screaming. He told them to stop, told them he surrendered.”

I watched her body jerk, her fingers trailing up and down her arm, like she could still feel him.

“The next, I was covered in his blood. Jonas was everywhere. He was in my hair, I could taste him in my mouth.” 

Clara giggled. She was breathless suddenly, grasping onto Sam’s arm, squeezing until he murmured to her. “Jonas tasted like spaghetti sauce, and he felt like nothing.” Her voice cracked. 

“His brains were pooling beside me, Adeline, and they didn’t care. They just kept killing my friends.”

Her voice broke into a cry. “I begged them. I told them to fucking kill me too.”

“Hey.” Sam’s eyes were soft. “Hey, take it easy. What did we say? Not all at once.”

Clara nodded. “I’m okay.”

The girl sniffled, wiping at her nose. “Two of the soldiers were talking. I was the only one left standing. They were already ordering the others to start disposing of the bodies, and in that moment, I realized I had only two choices: stay and wait to die, or take a chance and run for my life.” 

Her smile was haunted. “I ran. I ran from them. Jonas, Liv, and Isabelle. I watched them drag away the bodies of my friends. Then I followed the others, the blues and purples, into the facility.”

Her relief was mine too. Sitting in that uncomfortable silence following her retelling the murder of her friends, was overwhelming. “That’s when I found Sam.” She drew in a shaky breath.

“Sam was alive. He was dragged right off the bus when he punched a teacher in the face, and knocked out.” 

Clara let out a short, bitter laugh. “He was always getting into fights at school. I guess this time it saved him. They drugged him so he wouldn’t wake up and just threw him on the floor.” 

She sniffled again. “Sam was barely responsive, lying in a pile of our dead friends. But he was okay. He wanted to go back, wanted to take all of them out. Get our revenge.” She shot him a watery grin. 

“Let’s just say Sam was pretty vocal under some serious anesthesia.” Clara’s smile faded. “I took a chance. Sam was the only one left, the only red that survived, and I lifted him into my arms and ran.”

Sam nodded, tracing his scar. He was smiling. “Princess Clara Danvers, who teased me in sophomore year, had saved me.” He pointed at himself. “Me. The damsel in distress.”

His smile curled. “You did drop me twice, though. I’m blaming my sudden influx of headaches on you.”

Clara gave him a playful shove, and comforted by her presence, he shifted closer, letting her rest her head on his shoulder. Sam leaned in, reaching for her hand. On the surface, they didn’t match: freak and valedictorian, outcast and princess. 

But somehow, they fit. 

I could see exactly what Sam was doing, making it easier for her to tell their story. 

I wondered if he was all Clara needed to stay afloat, to keep her breathing, to keep her head above water, just like Nick had been for me. 

When I lost Bobby, when she was taken inside to be processed, I had clung to Nick with everything I had. 

“Anyway,” Clara said, wringing her hands in her lap. “We got out.” She gestured behind her. 

“There’s nothing back there but a dead end. A ravine. Back then, we thought…” Her voice choked. 

“We thought it was the best choice. My mom wasn’t real. My family. My town. None of it was. It was all a setup for some messed-up experiment. We were completely alone. Nobody was coming for us and if they were, it was only for our fucking body parts.""

Clara's gaze found the dirt. 

""Eventually, Mom found us. She told me they wanted my heart to give to some kid in the real world. She said they had to take it while it was still healthy, before my body started rejecting the program. They wanted Sam’s organs for a full transplant.” 

Her hand went to her chest. 

“It was my heart,” she said softly, and I couldn’t help but notice her use of the past tense. “I didn’t care if I wasn’t supposed to be real, if we were just skins and pretty faces for their soldiers, and I was nothing but body parts ready for donation. They weren’t taking me. And they weren’t taking Sam.”

I was hit with a wave of realization. “You jumped.”

Sam nodded. “Wouldn't you?"" 

“The ravine wasn’t what we were expecting,” Clara said softly. “We expected to.. well, we expected to die.”

Sam leaned back on his elbows with a sigh. “Imagine our surprise when we didn’t get obliterated on sharp rocks and ended up in the sea.” 

His laugh was easy, and I found myself drawn to it, a welcome distraction from their story. 

“Yeah, that’s right,” he added, tipping his head back and frowning at the sky. 

“Aceville’s an island. Those psychos bought it and built it to look exactly like a normal American town.”

I waited for Clara to continue, but her gaze seemed distant. Sam, noticing, took over. 

“Anyway,” he said, glancing at her, his eyebrows knitting together with concern. 

“Since we weren’t that far out, we swam to shore. And it turns out there’s an entire place built for this experiment. The people running it live there with their families, including kids, teenagers, and the elderly. It’s a whole community devoted to creating us.” 

“Aceville soldiers are made here and then sent off to train as the country’s top defense.” He chuckled. “They really trust eighteen-year-old, brainwashed super soldiers with the nuclear codes.”

Clara shoved him. “Shush.” She rolled her eyes at me before continuing. 

“We found an old abandoned house. I think it was here long before they built the research facility or the apartment blocks for the workers’ families.” Her expression darkened. “But we were dying,” Clara whispered. “We were vomiting blood, with headaches like thunderclaps. Bleeding out of every orifice–”

“Clara.” Sam rolled his eyes. “I've just had my lunch.” 

She elbowed him. “We were too weak to find food or water, so that night we just lay on bug-infested floorboards, waiting to die. The roof had caved in, so we could see the stars.” The girl smiled faintly. 

“It was… pretty. Peaceful. Painful. I remember having to gag my screams, rolling back and forth as my body bled out. But it was so *human*, and I would give anything to feel it again.” 

Clara's voice faltered. “That night, I knew I was going to die. I told Sam I loved him. I fell asleep knowing my heart was still in my chest and that it was still mine.”

Her eyes glistened with tears. “I was at peace knowing I could die far away from that awful place.”

“And surprise, surprise?” Sam sent me a smirk.

I frowned at him. “You didn’t?” I caught myself. “You didn’t die, I mean.”

He shook his head. “Oh no, we did.”

His words sent my thoughts into a tailspin.

“I don’t understand.”

“Duh.” The boy’s smile was teasing. “Haven’t you worked it out yet? We died.” He threw a branch at me. “You see dead people.”

“Ignore him.” Clara turned and prodded him in the cheek.

“Ow.” His response was more sarcastic than pained.

“But he’s not wrong.” Clara gave me a weak, uneasy smile. “First of all, it’s not technically dying,” she said. 

“Think of it more like rebooting. The defections did kill us, yes, but we were brought back. The thing in our necks, what they call a Zero, was implanted for one purpose. Humans naturally die, right? We all have an expiration date.”

She drew idle circles in the dirt. “Aceville soldiers don’t. Not because of who we are, but because of what they made us for. If we’re shot in the head, we come back minutes later, stronger than before.""

""Mr. Fuller was right. They strip away our humanity so it doesn’t hurt. When you die and come back enough times, it stops mattering. In a way, it’s merciful, the mind control, I mean. It dulls everything.""

Something was wrong. I realized it too late. 

I should have seen it earlier, when Bobby was squeezing the breath from my lungs, and somehow, I still had breath left to take.

“That’s what happened to you.”

Clara’s voice softened. “Earlier, when you were defecting, you died, Adeline. It happened to Sam and me, and to the few kids we’ve managed to save. We’re rare cases, those who defect and come back before they can incinerate us.”

Her tone hardened. “That’s why they get rid of us the moment our brains start to turn.”

“Because we’ll rise again,” Sam added. “Trust me, it’s not as Hollywood blockbuster as you think. In the movies people come back in seconds. Initially, it takes a while for us to fully revive. You took nearly an hour.” He offered a smirk. 

“We don’t eat brains, so stop looking at me like that. No superpowers, unfortunately. We’re like Captain America before he was made into Captain America.”

“But…” I was struggling to take in his words. All I could see were my own fingers slick with Nick’s blood, and the tiny device I’d crushed between my index and forefinger. “My… my friend—”

He cut me off. “Your mate Nick? Well, as for the others, it’s a different story. He was a success initially, before he defected, so yeah, he’s nothing like our lame asses. They’ve definitely upgraded their programming. Nick’s more of a Black Widow, I’d say. The kid’s got moves.” 

Sam caught my eye, his lip curving into a pout. 

“Sorry. I know I should be relieved that my brain can’t compute with the program, but come on, I want superpowers too.”

“They’re not superpowers,” Clara said stiffly.

Sam shrugged. “And since their programs didn’t work on us, we kept our minds, rendering us walking corpses.""

Their words didn’t feel real.

I was dead.

No, I thought, even when I knew they were right. I had stopped bleeding. Stopped defecting. The headaches were gone.

“No,” I heard myself say. “No, I’m alive.”

Though it came out more like a question.

Clara’s smile was sad. “That’s what I thought too,” she said. “Until I…” She trailed off, her hand pressing over her chest.

I wanted to copy her, I wanted to, but I couldn’t. If I did, if I placed my hand over my heart and felt nothing, I’d start screaming and never stop.

My mind snapped back to Kenji Leonhart, his body draped over a soldier’s back. The blood running down the back of his shirt. He wasn’t a red.

Which meant he was a blue or a purple, one of the first to defect, one of the first kids who wasn’t a red to be incinerated.

If only Nick and I had gone back for him. Then we might have been able to save him. But how could we have known? How could we have known that he’d come back?

I couldn’t help it. My eyes were stinging, but the tears didn't come.

“Am I even human?”

Clara grabbed Sam’s hand and squeezed. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I haven’t felt my heartbeat in so long. And yet I age. I can smell and taste. Eating and sleeping are hard. I can only manage coffee right now, but I don’t get tired. I should feel human, right?”

She tried to smile. “It’s like my body is pretending to be alive so I don’t freak out. I can breathe, but it doesn’t feel natural when I pay attention to inhaling and exhaling.” She sighed. “Really, it’s cruel. I feel synthetic pain, but it’s not real pain.”

She laughed, though it came out choked. “I guess the device is supposed to mimic real human pain, though I don’t understand why they’d do that to a bunch of brain-dead super soldiers. We’re supposed to be mindless. Most of the time, I can deal with it. But it never goes away.”

The girl lay her head on Sam’s shoulder again, grasping for his hand, and I felt that connection between them. 

“That feeling, Adeline. Knowing I’m dead, knowing the only thing keeping me going is the device in the back of my neck and the program in my brain that doesn’t work. My body’s a puppet, and without it, I’d drop dead for real.”

“Is there a way to… stop it?” I managed to get out.

“Defecting?” Sam shrugged.  “I’ve never seen a kid recover.” He jutted his chin at Bobby. “Your friend’s got a better chance with a real doctor on the mainland.”

“How long does she have?”

“Judging from her nose, I’d say it’s early defection. Maybe a few hours.”

“Nick.” Something cold slithered through me. I shakily got to my feet. “I took it out of him. Does that mean…”

Sam whistled. “Without that freaky revival device, the kid is a *kid*. A mind-controlled kid with some serious Captain America specs. If Fuller hasn’t noticed and your friend defects, he’ll stay dead.”

Clara’s tone was a warning. “Sam.”

“What?” Sam groaned. “Do you want me to sugarcoat it? Tell her the Castor boy is perfectly fine, and it's all rainbows and fuckin’ sunshine?”

The ground suddenly felt strange, like I was walking on air. 

“I promised him,” I managed to choke out. “I… I promised him I wouldn’t let him become one of those things. I said we were going to get out of here. All three of us.”

*“He is… valuable to us.”*

Bobby’s voice sliced through me.

Her body was rattling on the ground, and she was spitting blood. 

When I rolled her onto her back, her expression was blank, but her eyes were open. 

The eyes I’d fallen in love with.

I lurched back, her flickering gaze lazily followed mine.

*“Hand yourself in.”* Bobby’s tone was exactly like Nick’s, drained of everything I loved about her.

“It’s okay.” Clara’s voice was soft. “She’s defecting. She’s not a threat.”

“So, wait, is that like some kind of telepathy shit?” Sam’s eyes snapped to me. “How did she do that?” 

“Bobby.” I knelt next to her. “It’s… it’s going to be okay.” I expected tears to come, but they didn’t.

I pressed a kiss to her forehead, catching Clara’s eye. “You spoke of a mainland. Can you get us there?”

She nodded. “Sam and I have been living on the mainland. Every year we come back and try to save as many as possible, then smuggle them back home.”

“How many?” I held her gaze, but she refused to meet my eyes.

“Twelve. Including you.”

“Only twelve?”

Sam’s laugh was harsh. “We only got two last year. 2017 and 2018 were our best. We saved as many as we could, but those bastards always win.”

“Just you two?”

Clara hummed. “Our first mistake was trusting people.”

“Yeah.” Sam ran a hand through his hair. “Waking up washed up on a beach with a rapidly mending hole in my forehead and seaweed in my mouth taught us that. 

""Strangers, no matter how nice they seem, will fucking kill you. We have to be careful on the mainland. One mention of Aceville gets you a frontal lobotomy or your ass tied to a chair and tortured.”

Sam’s words were bouncing around my skull, but I wasn’t registering them. I was already thinking about Nick. He was still in that building.

“Give me an hour,” I said, my tongue in ties. “I’ll get Nick, and you’ll save them, right? Both of them.”

Clara’s expression was sympathetic. “If his device has been taken out and he’s defecting…”

I didn’t want to hear it. “He’s my best friend. He’s still alive, and they’re not going to let him die. They need him.” I choked. “We can save him. Outside Aceville.""

Sam scowled, but after a moment, his expression softened. “Jessica Hart,” he murmured. “2018. She was processed, but we managed to save her. Pure determination, man. I’d never seen anything like it. That girl’s grip on her own mind was steely.”

“If there’s a chance that part of your friend held on, and they haven’t thrown him in the incinerator already…” He sent me a look. “It’s a shot in the dark, but is it really worth it? What if your friend’s body is down there, or they’ve chopped him up…”

“Sam!” Clara squeaked. “Inside voice!”

“Yes.” I spoke without thinking. “He’s still in there. I know he is.”

Sam looked skeptical before sighing. “Fine. One hour.” He nodded to Clara. “Go with her. I’ll look after the defecting blondie.”

“You’re not immortal,” he said when they hugged. 

I wanted that. I wanted Nick’s arms around me, his fingers tangled in mine. I just wanted my best friend. I wanted him, and I wanted Bobby back by my side.

“They can’t kill you,” Sam pulled something from his jacket and pressed it into her hand. “Point and shoot. Even if you’re a lousy shot.” He offered her a grin, and she rolled her eyes, shoving him.

“Shut up.”

Clara grabbed and squeezed my hand, and before I knew it, she was dragging me back to the clearing, back to where Nick was either dead or alive. I already knew what I was going to do when I found Fuller.

Clara held my arm tightly, her fingernails digging into my skin.

I trusted her steps, her murmured reassurances. She was surprisingly good with the gun, taking out the two guards at the front of the facility at point-blank range without hesitation.

After shooting the guards outside, she grabbed my arm again, keeping a steely grip, and dragged me through the entrance. 

To my surprise, the corridors were empty. Stuffing her pistol down the waistband of her pants, Clara led me down the hallway, moving with slow, cautious steps. I stayed quiet as we climbed the stairs.

I kept having flashbacks to the night before, when I had lost Nick. 

When he had been dragged away, and I couldn’t save him. His words were still rumbling in the back of my mind, echoing in my skull: “Don’t let me become a white picket fence freak,” he had gasped.

“Promise me, Addie!”

And I had promised him.

I had promised him with my last breaths under the stars, waiting for my heart to stop. I had promised him when he had been dragged away to be reprogrammed. Just thinking about him, about my best friend, about saving his mind, made me stagger, struggling to keep up with Clara. 

When we reached the second floor, she stopped at a door and pressed her face against it. 

It felt strange. The last time I had been on this corridor, my filthy feet had pressed against perfect marble flooring, my breath thin, barely fluttering through my lips, and pain. I had been in so much pain, the kind that made me want to die.

Now, all of that was gone. And I craved it. I craved the desperation that had made me feel alive in the first place. Instead, I was numb. Dead flesh.

“If Fuller’s going ahead with Nick’s programming, he should be in one of the rooms downstairs.” Clara pushed the handle down and the door opened. 

“First, though, we’re going to make a quick detour.”

The way she held the handle, knuckles white around the silver steel, told me that whatever was in that room, it meant something to her. 

Meant something to Sam.

“What’s in there?” I asked.

Clara frowned, her lip curling slightly. “Addie, if it’s too much—”

“No,” I said. “I’m okay.”

She shot me a look, the kind Mom gave me when I bought a Sabrina the Teenage Witch comic in eighth grade. Disapproving.

Clara was five years older than me, and she was already like the big sister I had never had.

The room we stepped into wasn’t a programming room. I would have recognized the machines Nick had talked about, the ones I had seen before, blades, saws, knives tainted red. I will never get that image out of my head.

Inside this room, though, what I saw was worse. Clara moved toward a pile on the pristine white floor. As I followed, I realized it wasn’t clothes she was looking at.

They were bodies, my classmates, piled on top of each other. Purple and blue rings stained their shirts, and their gray, lifeless faces stared up with eyes frozen wide in horror. Blood spattered across them, deep red that had long since dried to a dark, crusted brown.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. My mind was trapped, replaying the scene, watching them fall one by one, shot right in front of me.

But I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just stood there, waiting for pain that never came.

Clara moved among them like a frantic insect until she finally straightened up. Her expression broke into a smile I couldn’t understand. Why did she look so hopeful when all I could see was red?

“They’re okay,” she gasped. Maybe she was crying or trying to. It was hard to tell. She pointed to each body as if she recognized them, but she didn’t. Clara didn’t know Elodie McIntire or Tommy Chambers.

I tried to see them as they once were, as people, as friends, but I couldn’t. Something was wrong. Something was off.

Before I could take it all in, Clara’s hands were on my shoulders, gently pushing me back. I knew what I was doing. I was looking for Nick. I was always looking for him, even when I didn’t want to find him.

But it wasn’t Nick. It wasn’t Nick, and I should have felt relieved. I should have been glad.

“Addie,” Clara whispered. “Hey, don’t look, okay? It’s better if you don’t look.”

But I couldn’t not look. I couldn’t not see that pieces of them were missing, like incomplete jigsaw puzzles. Clara was laughing. I think she was. Her smile lit up her face, but her eyes were far too haunted for me to believe it.

“They still have their zeros! Addie, they’re going to be okay. They’re going to reboot.”

I swallowed thickly, forcing my gaze away from the piles of bodies, from Tommy and Elodie.

“They’re freshly dead,” Clara explained. “When we get Nick, we’re bringing them too. We can save so many.” She checked the backs of their necks. “Their zeros are still installed and active. They’re going to be okay.”

She kept saying it.

They’re going to be okay.

I wanted to ask how that was possible, when they had been hacked apart, when legs and arms were missing, skin cruelly stitched back together. 

But I couldn’t help feeling the slightest tinge of hope when looking at Clara right then.

“Sam is going to be ecstatic,” she whispered, grasping my arm for dear life. 

In that moment, she was my anchor, keeping me stable, keeping me afloat. 

I wouldn’t think about Nick or the gruesome scene in front of me twisting my gut into knots.

“Every year he blames himself when we can’t rescue as many kids as possible.”

Clara’s gaze dropped to the ground, her voice splintering.

“He goes into this state where he just sits there staring into space. None of us can get him out of it. When we first started saving kids, and ultimately losing them, he said it’s cruel. The zeros are cruel.” 

“He said he would rather cut his out than pretend to breathe. But I won’t let him. I know it’s awful to try to force someone to live when they’re not really living, when all they want to do is just end it. Maybe I’m selfish, but I can’t do this without him.""

She shrugged. ""He’s been with me for the past five years, and I can’t imagine a morning or night without his whiny ass.”

“Is he…?” I swallowed the rest of my words.

“No,” she said, but I could tell by the pinch between her brows that I was right.

I should have seen it in his expression, in his sardonic attitude and scowl. 

Clara sighed. “He’s just tired of us losing. Every year, fifty seniors get on that bus, and we end up with only two or three if we’re lucky. Last year was the worst.""

""We lost the entire class, Addie. It nearly drove him over the edge. The thing is, we can’t smoke or drink. Well, we can, but it doesn’t affect us. We can’t taste cigarettes, feel the buzz from alcohol, or experience the euphoria of climax of sex. It feels of nothing.""

I pulled a face, and she surprised me with a laugh.

""We’re not robots!” 

Her expression sobered. “I mean, not *that* kind.” 

Clara grabbed my hands, entangling her fingers with mine. “What do you feel?”

Nothing. 

But I didn't say that. 

As if reading my mind, the girl offered a small smile. “You're already thinking like a soldier. You want to say my hand is clammy and my temperature is fluctuating. You can sense every nerve ending, and, if you push hard enough, you can read my thoughts.” She let go, immediately, and that connection crumbled. I was cold again. 

“Everything humans have to take the ache away, even if it’s just temporary, we don’t have that. We just pretend we do. Even our pain is superficial.” 

Clara’s gaze flicked to the defects. “I know it doesn’t seem like much. But to Sam, it’s everything. That scar on his face? Yeah, he did that. When we lost all those kids, he tried to hurt himself.”

Her words whirled around my mind as I tried to register them, trying to understand that Sam didn’t want to pretend to live anymore. And if he felt like that, would that thought ever cross my mind too? 

Would pretending to live without real feelings drive me crazy?

Something caught my eye, pulling me from my thoughts. 

There was movement on the other side of the room, and I couldn’t help myself.

I stumbled to a metal table where a body lay under harsh white light.

1qf2l3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saturdead/comments/1qf2l3w/weekly_story_oak/,Weekly story: Oak,"I can’t believe I managed to forget about her. After everything that happened, that ought to have been impossible. And yet, it’s been 20 years since I last spoke of miss Reed. I figured this would be a good time to write it down, if only to get it out of my system once and for all. Then again, maybe this will go away too.

My mother had me at 39. She hadn’t planned on ever having kids, so when I came along, she had already settled for a certain lifestyle. She tried to pivot as best she could, but habits can be hard to break. She had a lucrative career that forced her to travel a lot, leaving me to be cared for by babysitters, aunts, uncles, and distant cousins. They were kind and generous people, eager to share everything from warm beds to hot meals. And the stories – there were always stories being told.

I ended up being a pretty good listener. I kept that trait all the way through high school, and I ended up studying human development and psychology, leading me to occupational therapy. I originally wanted to work with forensic psychology, but when it really came down to it, I wanted to help regular folks more than I wanted to put away bad guys.

I started seeing my first patients in the spring of 2003. Most of them were bi-weekly meetings, and after a couple of sessions many either quit entirely or reduced their visits to monthly, depending on their insurance coverage. Some had more permanent conditions that required regulated psychopharmaca that I would end up seeing over several years.

 

2005 started off uneventfully. I had to call on a neighbor to help get my cat Romeo out of a tree, but that was pretty much the height of excitement. Then I was scheduled to see a new patient; miss Reed. Now, I get new patients all the time, but miss Reed was a bit of an edge case. Most of my patients were assigned from insurance companies, but miss Reed came to me privately – paying out of her own pocket to see me. It wasn’t unheard of, but unusual. Especially considering her symptoms.

I met miss Reed on a late Tuesday afternoon in late May. It was pouring down, and I’d had three prior meetings. This was scheduled to be my last session for the day. You always have to be a bit extra careful at first meetings, you have to make sure people are at ease. I put out a small bowl of seedless grapes to show that she was expected and welcome. I emptied the trash to show that nothing gets left behind from previous patients. Just these little things remind them that it is a safe space, and that they’re free to share whatever.

Miss Reed stepped into my office with her short afro pulled back into a headband. She had pierced ears, but no jewelry. No necklace or rings. Her large brown eyes looked tired, but she tried her best to smile. I introduced myself and offered her a seat, asking her what she would like to talk about. She neatly placed her purse in her lap, took a deep breath, and looked me in the eyes.

“I’m not a person,” she said.

“What makes you say that?” I asked.

“That’s just the way things are now. I used to be a person, but now I’m not.”

“Do you know how this change came about?”

She adjusted her headband and nodded.

 

A couple of weeks prior to seeing me, miss Reed had been a helper on her niece’s outing for the Girl Scouts. They’d first gone to see Mount Rushmore, then they’d driven far out into the countryside to set up camp. They’d been following the Runalong river. Problem was, they forgot one of the tents. Miss Reed went back to get it on her own, and somewhere along that trail, *something* happened. That’s as specific as she could be – *something* happened. Pressing her on the matter, albeit gently, didn’t help. It’s not that she didn’t *want* to tell, it seemed she was unable to remember.

“When I got back to camp, I could feel something had changed,” miss Reed explained. “Like I’d been struck by a silent lightning.”

“And that was the moment you realized you weren’t a person anymore?”

“Not immediately,” miss Reed continued. “It came little by little. I would look at my hand and forget what it was, seeing it like it was a strange animal that crawled into my tent. My heart would skip a beat. Then I’d forget what a yawn was, or how to read facial cues.”

“Just like that?”

“Just like that.”

 

That first session with miss Reed was unusual for a lot of reasons, but I made a couple of observations. The whole event had the tellings of a trauma response, that something awful had happened to her along that river, and this was her way of protecting herself. Then again, I could tell there was something off. She had these strange tics, like picking her nose and pinching her cheek. She said it helped remind her that she had a face.

I made some notes about dissociative identity disorder or possible PTSD. Those were the first avenues to explore in our next session. She was perfectly pleasant to talk to, but I could tell this unnerved her. She wasn’t sleeping well, and she didn’t know what to make of it. She knew this wasn’t normal.

She wasn’t a *person* anymore. It’s like there was a part of her that’d been erased, and she kept being reminded of it.

 

We scheduled miss Reed’s second session a week later. There had been a mix-up with the dates, and her name had accidentally dropped off the schedule. My office had a joint administrator that handled booking for a couple of us working in the building, and things got lost sometimes – it happened. I thought I was done for the day when miss Reed walked in, but she didn’t seem all that upset. She offered to reschedule for another day, but I insisted she stuck around. I felt bad about her coming all the way to see me, only to be turned around at the door because of a booking error.

“This happens,” she smiled. “All kinds of things treat me like I’m not a person anymore. That goes for computers, too.”

“Do you think computers can make the distinction between a person and a not-person?”

“Everything can. They *have* to.”

We sat down and talked a little bit about her upbringing. She was a salt of the earth kind of South Dakota girl. Mid-20’s, worked in the family business. The way she talked about it surprised me – there was nothing *inherently* wrong. For all intents and purposes, there didn’t seem to be anything strange about her life apart from that one incident down the Runalong river – and she couldn’t remember any of it.

 

Before we ended the session, I wanted to ground her in something she could think about until next time. I brought up childhood memories. I figured if I could get her to think about something else than her affliction, that might alleviate some of her anxieties. I asked her to tell me about a positive memory.

“We had this oak by the field,” she smiled. “It had a swing, a treehouse, and the branches were so thick you could fall asleep on them. There was this hole where owls would roost. Everyone loved it. Played with it. Haven’t thought about it in years.”

“Well,” I said. “If you can’t be a person anymore, imagine yourself as an oak. *That* oak, if you will. Someone strong, and timeless. Those aren’t just properties of people; they’re things we cherish in everything.”

She nodded at that, and her smile lingered.

“Not a person,” she mumbled. “Imagine an oak.”

 

It took two weeks before I saw miss Reed again. I was a bit late for work as Romeo got out and ran up a tree. He was by far the most antisocial cat I’d ever owned. You had to bribe him to show his face around people, but the slightest sight of a tree had him sprinting for the door. At least this time I got him down without having to beg to use the neighbor’s ladder.

By the time I got to work, miss Reed was already there. The office administrator had completely forgotten that she was even in the waiting room. I apologized and invited her in, still combing leaves out of my hair. At least Romeo had been kind enough not to scratch me up.

“I’ve imagined it a lot,” miss Reed said. “Being an oak. I think that can be a beautiful thing.”

“I’m glad you think so,” I smiled. “Have you felt any different since we last met?”

“I’ve slept better,” she admitted. “I feel more energetic. I eat more. Drink better.”

“That’s good. Very good. I think we’re making progress.”

 

As we talked, I noticed a couple of unusual movements. Miss Reed angled herself so that she faced the morning sun coming in from the window. She would spread out her fingers like branches, as if trying to soak up the sun. The thought dawned on me that maybe I had accidentally replaced one fix idea with another. Then again, as long as it wasn’t harmful, maybe it was a step in the right direction.

“If you really were an oak, what would you do?” I asked.

“I would tell you that it’s me,” she smiled.

“How would you do that? An oak can’t talk.”

I figured that getting her to admit that certain features of being an oak are incompatible with her body, as to reinforce the properties of the tree rather than physicality. But miss Reed just nodded, thought about it for a while, and spoke in a low tone.

“I would grow my leaves black and blue. Then you would know it’s me.”

We had to cut the meeting short. I’d accidentally been double-booked. Miss Reed didn’t mind and told me she’d be in touch. As she hurried out, I got this cold feeling in my stomach. Something about her demeanor had changed, and I didn’t know if I liked it. She seemed happier, yes, but there was something else, too.

After she left, I spotted her standing in the parking lot, facing the sun. Her arms spread out, as if trying to catch the rays.

 

I thought a lot about miss Reed over the coming week. She didn’t schedule a new appointment. I had a lot of other patients to work with, but something about her particular problem felt unusual. I’d never even heard of the Runalong river, but something must have happened there. It was easy to imagine some kind of assault, but that would have shown itself in other ways. Her entire problem was summed up with a lack of identity, and I couldn’t understand the root cause.

I didn’t see miss Reed again until late June. I had just finished up a prior meeting and got back into my office. I sat down, flipped up my laptop, and saw two brown eyes staring at me from across the room.

I almost fell out of my chair.

Miss Reed had been standing there for God knows how long. She didn’t have an appointment, and I hadn’t heard from her in weeks. She looked different from when I last saw her. Her afro had grown sparse enough that I could see her scalp, and her eyes had grown darker.

“They don’t pick up my calls no more. The phone forgets to ring.”

I swallowed heard and took a deep breath.

“I’m sorry. That sounds very inconvenient.”

“Makes sense,” she mumbled. “Oak’s ain’t supposed to make phone calls.”

I noticed she wasn’t wearing any shoes. Her toenails had grown long, and the sharp edges got caught in the frills of the office rug. She sat down with a thud, letting her arms hang listlessly to the side like a stringless marionette.

 

I had originally planned to do some office work, but I could tell she wasn’t doing well. You have to be careful with volatile patients, even if they don’t have a history of violence. Miss Reed was exhibiting some uncomfortable behavior, and I wasn’t sure what to make of it.

“I keep having this dream,” she said. “Something dark comes down the river. The water pools beneath it, making the fish spin in circles long enough to die from exhaustion. There are dragonflies spinning round and round, drawing patterns in the air. Then I see it too. I touch it. And it feeds into me, like rainwater to a parched root.”

“And it tells you that you’re not a person.”

She nods.

“But not with words,” she clarifies. “But with an absence.”

She tried to get up, but she couldn’t quite get the balance right. She winced as if adjusting to sudden back pain. A tuft of hair drifted from her head, crumbling on the plate of seedless grapes. After a couple of seconds, she straightened out, turning completely still. I couldn’t even see her breathe.

“I don’t like what this is doing to me,” she whispered. “Why can’t I be a person anymore?”

“You are,” I said. “An oak, that was just… a grounding exercise. A way to recontextualize your self-image to something sturdy and positive.”

“I thought so too. But now I can’t stop it. That image is there. It’s stuck.”

“Miss Reed, what exactly do you think is happening?”

 

She walked forward like a child balancing over the stones of a river. I took a step back as she lunged forward, tripping on her own feet. She braced herself against my desk, then pushed herself back up.

“I dream about long fingers,” she said. “That my bones and nails grow longer, and longer, and longer. So long they touch the sky. And the farther they reach, the warmer I feel.”

She stretched her hand, crackling her knuckles.

“That warmth is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. And in that moment I figured that, if I’m not a person, what’s so bad about being an oak?”

“What happens when you look at yourself in the mirror?” I ask. “What do you see there, if not a person?”

Her eyes widened as she pointed at me with a long-nailed finger.

“I see a *seed*.”

 

When miss Reed finally left my office, I barely noticed she was gone. It felt like she disappeared in a blink, but I knew for a fact that she’d been gone for a while. It’s like it was getting harder and harder to remember she’d been there in the first place. I wrote down ‘Miss Reed’ on a post-it and stuck it to my laptop, then talked to the administrator. She hadn’t even noticed miss Reed enter the building.

I felt responsible. Yes, my intentions had been to help, but I’d accidentally aided in her delusion. I’d misjudged just how impressionable she was, and this one suggestion had changed everything. And it didn’t look like it was making any changes for the better. If anything, I was getting more worried about her.

There is a certain line you shouldn’t cross as a mental health professional. You have to separate your work from your private life. I tried not to bring my worries about miss Reed with me home, but sometimes I couldn’t help it. Not because she was constantly on my mind, but because I found myself forgetting about her for large swathes of time. Days would pass without her name even registering in my conscious thoughts. I kept getting surprised to see that post-it on my laptop with her name on it over and over again.

That is, until one day, when the note was empty. And in that moment, a thought crossed my mind.

Can an oak have a name?

 

Despite forgetting about her over and over, I tried my best to make an effort. A conscious, *professional* kind of effort. Every time her name was brought up, I wrote it down, but I kept misplacing my notes. I would forget to save documents about her on my laptop. After a while, I started to think about her in abstract shapes and features. Not like a person, but like the way you remember the rubber texture of your favorite playground swing.

Sometimes I’d look up into my empty office, as if expecting to see her looking back. I never did. I couldn’t get a hold of her through the phone, so I tried reaching her through her family. I considered calling in a wellness check, but I couldn’t recall where she lived. The reason I call her ‘miss Reed’ here at all is because I genuinely can’t remember her first name. I’m not even sure miss Reed is the right name, but it’s the one I think about when I remember her.

Her family didn’t have much to say. Most of them barely remembered her, while others were making up memories on the fly.

“I think she finally got a place of her own.”

“Didn’t she move in with that guy, the one on…”

“Oh yeah, I’m sure she’s around, she’s just busy.”

But for all their reassurances, I wasn’t any closer to actually finding her. And as days turned to weeks, miss Reed faded from my memory. Not because I didn’t care, but because I couldn’t think of her as a patient. Whenever I pictured her, there was something else sitting across from me. Not a woman. Not a patient.

Not even a person anymore.

 

Things were almost normal for a while. I had other patients who kept me busy, and I spent my nights in the comfort of my home in the company of friends, family, and my cat. I didn’t think much of miss Reed and her unfortunate obsession, and whenever I did, I felt this uncomfortable chill in the pit of my stomach. Like I was a witness to something far worse than a mild delusion misleading a troubled person.

But notes about her faded. Memories too. Not that they were completely gone, but it’s like they’d been scrubbed out. I remembered her face as a pale gradient, and all details about her seemed misshapen and bent. It was like trying to remember the specifics of a particular tree in a forest; you remember general features, not specifics. You don’t count its branches.

But when I finally saw her again, it all came back to me.

 

It was late afternoon in early August. I was coming home from work, carrying a bag of groceries. I slipped the key into the lock, stepped inside, and paused for a moment. Had I actually turned the key? It felt like I hadn’t. But it couldn’t have been open already.

There was debris on the floor. Pieces of dirt and moss stuck on the carpet. There were drag marks, as if someone had pulled something heavy into the living room. But what really caught my attention was my cat, Romeo – or the lack thereof. Usually he tried to bolt out the door, but he wasn’t even peeking out to see what was going on this time. I called out to him, but I couldn’t hear his paws tip-tap in response.

I put down the groceries and looked around the corner into my bedroom. Nothing there. I stopped just short of rounding the corner into the living room and listened closely. There was some kind of noise. A rhythmic scratching, like nails against cheap plaster. I shivered as a voice snapped me out of my thoughts.

“You know how long it took to get here?”

The voice was familiar, but something was off. At first I didn’t recognize it. There was this low monotone quality to it, like listening to someone speak from behind a thin wall. When my memory finally clicked, all thoughts of miss Reed came flooding back.

“You need to make it all better,” she sobbed. “You have to fix this. You have to fix *me*.”

 

I wanted to peek around the corner, but there was something in me that didn’t want to. The scratches on the floor covered part of the far wall, and one of my paintings had fallen over and cracked. I could see the gleaming glass shards.

“How can I help?” I asked.

“You put this image in my head. I was not a person, and there was nothing there. But you put the *image* there, and everything *changed*. I need you to take it out. You need to take out… the image.”

“How can I do that? What can I say?”

“Just say I’m… strong! Or pretty! You can say whatever, just… tell me I’m not an *oak!*”

Something tapped against one of the living room windows as miss Reed sobbed. My breath trembled as my lips grew cold.

“Do you think that would help?”

There was a brief pause. There was a creaking sound as a weight shifted on my leather couch.

“No,” she sighed. “I suppose it wouldn’t.”

I closed my eyes and rounded the corner. I took a deep breath - and looked.

 

Miss Reed had closed the curtains, and the ceiling lamp had been torn down. A dying August light was still making its way in from the adjacent kitchen window, casting an orange silhouette of the living room. The place was a mess, like a hurricane had come and gone. And yet, in all that chaos, I could see Romeo sitting on her lap, purring his heart out and making biscuits.

“I want to be a person again,” miss Reed said. “I don’t want *this*. I want to choose.”

“It takes… work,” I said. “Hard work, over a long time. I can help.”

“No, you can’t. I’m not a *person* to you. Not a *person*, not a *patient*, not a *human*, not a…”

“Then what are you?” I interrupted. “What do you choose to be?”

“I didn’t *choose* *anything*. *You* did. You chose this *for* me!”

 

Romeo casually strolled out of her lap as miss Reed got up from the couch. Something long and white stretched out of her ribcage, tearing up the cheap living room wallpaper as she stood up. Her skin snapped and popped as she flexed her muscles, breaking apart at the seams. Her yellow toenails had broken into pieces, each section spreading out like a clutter of roots. I could hear the tapping as they poked against the coffee table.

She was tall. *Impossibly* tall. And her voice grew darker as she rose, as if her lungs had the sudden room to breathe.

“Get the image out,” she groaned. “Get the image out *now*.”

 

I ducked behind the kitchen island as an arm swept over me. It knocked over my coffee maker, my toaster, a rack of knives, and my kitchen towels. It all clattered to the floor. There was a growth branching off the edge of her wrist, getting tangled in the outer wisps of my unbrushed hair.

I kept close to the floor and hurried into the hallway. I could hear the lumbering footsteps behind me as something hard scratched against the wood. I ducked down and turned a sharp left as a large arm swept over me, knocking over a lamp and my grocery bag. I made it to the bedroom and slammed the door shut, but it bounced as something hard and wooden got in the way. I heard the crackle of a dry branch as something scattered on the ground. I only had a heartbeat to look, but I’ll never forget the image of well over a dozen human nails covering my bedroom floor.

She forced the door open as I dove over the bed and rushed into my closet. I closed it just as something massive slammed into it, breaking the top hinge and pressing me into the wall.

“I can’t be like this!” she shrieked. “I can’t be like this forever!”

Another push. A screw from the hinges pressed into the side of my temple, causing a warm streak of blood to pool down my face.

I had to do something. *Anything*.

 

“Imagine,” I wheezed. “Imagine you’re an oak.”

“…what?”

“Imagine you’re an oak,” I repeated. “Picture it.”

“…no.”

The pressure eased. I crouched down, covering the side of my head. I could feel the blood slipping through my fingers.

“Picture the branches,” I continued. “The bend at the bottom as the roots expand into the ground.”

“…no!”

“The wind rushing through your leaves. The rain soaking into your bark.”

She wasn’t even using words anymore. It was just this long, continuous shriek. She was trashing around my apartment, desperately swinging her arms around like a trapped wild animal. The scream grew louder and higher until I could no longer discern it from a howling wind.

“Imagine you’re an oak,” I repeated. “Imagine you’re an oak.”

I kept saying it over and over until the closet door collapsed. There were scrapes and cuts along the walls and floor. A couple of branches lay across the bedspread. Looking back at the bedroom door, I could see that there were no human nails; just acorns.

And all that remained of miss Reed was a shrieking wind coming through a broken window.

 

After a couple of days, I had forgotten all about miss Reed. I remembered it all as a fierce storm and an awful accident. I didn’t even question it. It’s not that I ignored that it happened, I just remembered it differently. I didn’t go looking for her. I didn’t call anyone about her. All I did was talk to my insurance company and get my place fixed up.

And for a long time, that’s how it’s been. I eventually moved out of South Dakota when I met my husband. I’m still seeing patients, and I did branch out into forensic psychology in later years. But not long ago, we made a trip back. I was going to see my half-brother in Rapid City when we stopped to stretch our legs. An eight-hour trip is no joke, especially when you got two impatient teenagers in the back seat.

As we stood there and my husband enjoyed a cigarette, I looked out on the open field. In the distance I saw this magnificent oak tree stretching out an immense crown of leaves. A couple of sunflowers rested underneath, mirroring the shade of its protector.

Title: I Woke Up and the Weekend Was Erased. That's Not the Worst Part.

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot. I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone. The calendar widget said Thursday. I remember thinking, “Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.” I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor: “Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.” He looked at me like I’d grown a second head. “What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?” He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing. Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday. They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit). “And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else. “…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse. Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)? I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?” She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?” The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always. “Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?” She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend. The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed. The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends. I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again. I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone. Please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

Title: UPDATE: The guy who DM'd me says the week used to be 14 days long.

I finally got a DM from a guy who knows what I'm talking about.

After my last post, while I was spiraling, a user named Adam reached out. He told me he understands exactly what my situation is. He knows that you know—and I know—that there used to be a Friday, a Saturday, and a Sunday.

But the issue is what he said next. I don't know how to process it.

He said originally, a week was not seven days like I remember. He said a week was 14 days. He listed them out, but my brain can barely hold onto the names. They sounded ancient, but followed the same pattern we are used to.

He said: Meriday, Falday, Lorday... I think I’m messing up the order. But there were 7 more on top of what I remember.

If I say ""Friday, Saturday, Sunday"" to my coworkers, they look at me like I’m insane. Now Adam is saying something that sounds just as crazy to me. My instinct is to tell him, ""Hey man, don't make things up.""

But he might be right.

I mean, look at me. I’m the only one who remembers the 7-day week. Maybe I just don't remember the original 14 days. Maybe I’m just as amnesiac as the people who forgot the weekend. I feel like I have to believe him. Otherwise, how could he be the only one who validates the existence of the weekend?

I saw some of you in the comments mentioning ""Lorday."" Adam confirmed that was one of the original 14 days. So that kind of validates his story. But here is the scary part: to me, right now, it is Wednesday. But Adam said for him, it was Meriday.

The timeline is no longer a single line for everyone. Things are deeply messed up.

Adam told me something else. Just like I realized everyone around me has lost the concept of church, God, and prayer, Adam remembers a concept called Ecarg (I think that’s the term he used). He said Ecarg was basically the privilege not to work.

He said he used to have that for the 14-day repeating cycle. He didn't have to work. It was paradise. But then suddenly, he lost it. He said it was because of a tree.

I don't know what that means, but he said after the tree incident, he lost the Ecarg. He lost the 14 days of rest. The week shattered into seven days. He was forced to labor for five, and only rest for two. I had questions but he went offline.

And now... now it’s happening again.

The privilege not to work is being deleted entirely.

Adam went from 14 days of rest to 2. I went from 2 days of rest to 0.

""No privilege not to work is given anymore.""

I don't know how to interpret this, but yesterday I was worried about Friday not coming. Now I'm worried about losing Wednesday and Thursday.

What if the five-minute break I take is going to go away? What if we only have Monday? What if I have to work 24/7 non-stop? What if even Monday is gone?

I'm terrified…

Today is Thursday... please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

\[UPDATE\] 12:00. I couldn't do it.

Guys, it’s almost midnight. I was watching the clock, waiting for the miracle.

Adam messaged me one last time. He sounded desperate, like he was seeing something I couldn't. He told me the whole story again. It was again about the tree, and how he messed up with the tree. How he got scammed by a voice like oil.

So what the heck did happen with the tree?

He said he didn't know it was that much expensive, and how that one ""bite"" put him in this debt.

Debt of what? Debt of labor, he said.

But then why me too?

Adam said he didn't know but instead, He told me about the guy who took the shift.

The one who worked through the hell of it to clear our balance. Adam said it was all over, that the bill was zero. He asked me, ""Can you believe this?""

I looked at my phone. I looked at the empty streets and the grey sky. I thought about all the Monday-to-Thursday distress, the endless grind, the exhaustion. What Adam told me was a crazy story. I tried to be logical .. It did not make any sense.

I typed back: ""No….""

Too good to be true is usually a scam.

That was it.

Then, the clock jumped.

Monday. No Miracle.

In the morning, my work alarm will start blaring through the speakers.

My phone is buzzing now. A text from my boss: “Tomorrow, we have a lot to catch up on. Don’t be late.”

The heavy, greasy weight of the debt slammed back onto my chest, twice as heavy as before. I looked out the window, thick and grey fog, hiding everything.

But the more I urinated the more it started to hurt and sting pretty badly, which was new to me. I went to urgent care and got a negative microscopic urine test and culture for a UTI and also no blood. So the next day I got an ultrasound on my bladder and kidneys, which also came out normal with no stones. I've now been taking doxycycline for 4 days with little to no results. I have a constant pressure feeling on my bladder area and still urinating very occasionally, but the pain is mostly gone. The doctor just said if the doxycycline doesn't work after 3 more days then to contact her. I think this could just be an irritated bladder or maybe IC? Any ideas what I should do to remedy this? I have been really uncomfortable for the past few days and it makes sitting and laying down way uncomfortable which is bad because I'm a student. ",2,1768621323.0,hygiene,14,1.0,False

Note to consumers, Forall censors negative reviews on their website and on the Shop app. A single ingredient whey protein isolate sounds good, until you realize what that entails. The lack of emulsifiers or anti-foaming agents means a lot of clumps and foam when mixed with water. They tout the ""snowfall not avalanche"" method, but whey is supposed to be clean, simple, and convenient-not come with special instructions for use. The videos on their website showing you how to mix it in coffee show an abundance of foam on the top even when using the ""snowfall not avalanche"" method and a frother. Another thing, the particle size is extremely small, and there's always a cloud of protein powder in the air when transferring one scoop of this WPI to a container. Therefore, things can get really messy.

For all the negatives, you pay over $3 per serving when factoring in shipping fees. They don't seem trustworthy either. They stated that all batches are independently tested for heavy metals, yet they can't provide COA results due to proprietary information. Will never buy again, and I'm here to warn you. I finished 10 servings before deciding to give the bag away. I only see this WPI appealing to those who intend to use it solely for cooking (not drinking) or those who are extremely sensitive to any additives that they need a single ingredient whey. Many other companies offer quality unflavored whey at a fraction of the price without all these negatives (eg Pure choice farms, transparent labs, Allmax isonatural, etc). The only other ingredient they contain is <1% lecithin, which makes a world of difference in terms of reducing clumps and foam when mixing.

Another concerning point is a lot of the five star reviews on their website received a lot of thumbs down, while their only one star review received a lot of thumbs up. They have since removed the option to thumbs up or thumbs down reviews from customers on their website. Their instagram seems to be comprised of a high amount of bought followers (ie accounts that follow thousands of people and have <10 followers). 

They also charge $43 for 12 bottles of water with 10 grams of protein each. That's 120 grams of protein total or 4 servings. They charge roughly $3 per serving of protein, so $12 worth of protein and 12 500 ml bottles of water can be bought in a supermarket for $3.

How do I approach this?,"I dated the absolute sweetest girl that I really started falling for. We only dated for a couple months and broke up 5 weeks ago. Everything was going perfect except intimacy. We tried to have sex a couple times but I couldn’t maintain an erection. She was always super sweet and reassuring, saying we just needed time to figure out what worked for us. We spent a week apart during the holidays and split up a couple days after she was back in town, even though she’d been messaging about how she missed me and wished we could hang. It was a very long in person break up in which she explained how she really wanted this to work out but felt like something was missing, and couldn’t put her finger on what it was. She denied that it had anything to do with our intimacy, but I’ve felt like that was probably a big reason. While we were dating I was taking an anti depressant. It wasn’t until I stopped taking it after we broke up that I realized how much it was affecting me mentally and physically, It ruined my confidence and killed my sex drive. Looking back we had absolutely no sexual chemistry because of my lack of drive. Now that I’ve stopped taking it my confidence and drive is back, I’m thinking about reaching out. I never disclosed I was taking a medication and chalked up the intimacy issues to my own anxiety. I want to explain the situation and how much better I’m doing in all areas of my life since getting off the medication with the hope of rekindling things. She works in mental health so I think she’ll be familiar and understanding with my struggles, but still not sure if reaching out is really the right thing to do.

More info: after the breakup I reached out a week later hoping to get coffee and share some thoughts. She declined and said it would make it harder to move on from, but said I could share my thoughts over text. At the time I was still on the antidepressants and hadn’t figured out what the real problem was, so I believed we just needed more time to grow the connection and fill in the “missing piece”. So that’s what I shared and she never responded.

TLDR: briefly dated the sweetest girl, who was really into me and was someone I saw a future with. Our intimacy wasn’t good because I had struggles with drive and keeping an erection due to being on an antidepressant, which I never disclosed to her. I stopped taking it and got on something new and feel like a brand new person. My confidence and drive is back so I’m thinking about reaching out and explaining the situation with the hope of rekindling things.",1,1768620888.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

**Death Note**: Beyond the teenage protagonists or the gothic atmosphere, it doesn't have the usual elements. If Hellsing or K-On are seinen, why not Death Note?

**Great Teacher Onizuka**: Golden Boy is classified as seinen, but this one isn't. Similar humor and crazy protagonist, bullying, education, teenage problems, ecchi, discrimination, fetishes. Interestingly, its sequel GTO Paradise is seinen.

**Detective Conan**: At first, one might say no because of the pleasant art style, but as the series progresses, it becomes more intricate and darker. The murders and the killer's confessions become more detailed, and the jazz music is unsettling.

It's also a series with excessive dialogue. Chapters like the case of the twin sisters: the mystery of the bathroom (121-122), the curse of Tottori's spider, the aroma of coffee with murderous intent, or the car bombing (150-151) are pretty heavy. Besides murder, drugs, some insults, violence, assassination attempts, blackmail, etc. It's a shame about those chapters with the children, but it's a bit heavy at times.

**City Hunter**: It's a pretty fun and lighthearted series, actually, but it has a lot of sexual humor and stars adults. If Lupin III or Golgo 13 are seinen, it's strange that this one isn't. Interestingly, its sequel, Angel Heart, is seinen.

I've also noticed that older manga like Ashita no Joe or Devilman are shonen, but if they were published today, they would definitely be seinen.

Left to both open, and play with all there brand new toys. To stuff their cheeks full with all the sweeter treats that spilled out their Christmas stockings. Parents left to watch the precious faces of each child, to share in their glee filled smiles. A father left to both set up, and take the perfect, family picture. To blind all with the sudden flash of powder. The first of many taken by those that stomped about what had been left of the boy's home. 

Countless men in blue now worked there way across each and every room. A morning that should of been spent at home, now spent in another.  No one knew where to even start, to make heads or tails of the situation. All they could do was take pictures, to search for what clues might of been left. A few trying to collect some sort of hair, or fiber off the flower like patterns left imprinted upon the walls. Didn't help two officers had been left staring at one another through one of many holes burned through the brick. Some one having made the mistake of trying to collect a bit of the greenish substance left on the fireplace mantle. Nearly lost a finger had been any slower in ripping his glove free. 

Between all the soot kicked up, ashe that had been knocked loose and covered every inch of this place, made it damn near impossible to find anything. Tracks of at least a dozen or so officers stomping about the place didn't help either when The Detective is trying to get a solid lead in this ongoing case. Those outside weren't better off, Drawing the short end of the stick as they'd been tasked with prying open and getting into the cab of the truck that had been sitting nearly pressed up against the kid's window. With how much already leaked out, They didn't expect for the flood that came once they had. With what had been left at this point of the driver wasn't even enough to tell if it had been a man, woman, or child. Didn't help between the sight what had been left, and the god awful smell that made it hurt to even breathe, No one could blame those officers for what came next. For as seasoned as they had been, for how familiar all had been with this case, this had been one of the worst scenes they had ever seen.

One of them even forced to sit down on what was left of the couch once they had finished heaving, having been doing it so long they damn near forgot how to breath. Least  sitting on what had been left of the damn thing dragged out to the street. One couldn't even tell if that crunching under foot had been the snow, or the glass from the shattered window. If things weren't bad enough, Mother nature decided now was the best time to show her face, All the evidence the snow might of had washed right down the drain. Deciding now of all times was the best time to start to melt the snow that hadn't budged for the better part of a week. A real shame it couldn't get rid of that damn stink.

 Was never a good sign when The Detective had been left, lost in his own thoughts. Not when he had that sort of distant look in his eye. For how still he always sat, It had always been the eerie calm, before a storm. The type most knew not to get caught up in.

""I'm watching you"" came that childish attempt at mimicking The Detective's abrasive tone. Left to stare down the barrel of the index finger the boy had been pointing at him. Index finger now grabbed by his mother as she now lead the boy out the kitchen, doing her best to keep his eyes covered. ""Think it's best we get going, wouldn't want to get in the way of all these nice gentleman.

Voice of his father now heard from behind. ""We're headed down to the church, It would be great if you could join us. Let the officers handle this for a change."" 

Answer given from his dad wasn't one he wanted to hear, yet knew it would be the same, of this man that had been set in his ways. ""I'm not going to leave until we're all finished here. 

""Isn't right for me to leave others to clean up this mess, Not when they should be spending the day with their families.""

""Not when that bastard crossed the line and left this message on my damn doorstep!"" The Detective left to relight the cigar that had been left neglected between his fingers. To down the cold cup of coffee that had gone untouched. ""I'll get this son of a bitch, if it's the last thing I do!"" 

""We'll see you later dad"" Solemn had been his father's words, his expression. 

Expression the boy could barely seen from the cracks between his mother's fingers, Trying to look back the best he could now that his mother had turned his head away from the truck they passed. Left to stare upon the shattered window he'd once stared from the back of the couch now passed. Surreal had been the black and white scene that would fold with every picture that had been taken. Surreal had been the raven, the feline that  sat side by side, perched upon the edge of the chimney.  Watching all those below scurry about like field mice. Eerie had been their silent gaze.

Nearly missing those that had been wearing a pair of familiar looking trench coats. Had it not been for the brushing of such a coat upon the boy's shoulder, none would of been aware of the other's presence. Moment that now drew those vacant stares, towards once another. To glimpse upon the uncanny familiarity in their blank expressions. As brief as the exchange had been, it had been enough to stop the pair dead in their tracks. One left to reach into their pocket for a notebook that simply had not been there. Something that left both to silently stare upon one another. To pull a notebook free a moment later, the moment they turned their attentions towards another.

Neither parent spoke now as they managed to reach main street. At this point the boy might of started looking for the canine that had gone on one of his usual adventures. Had his mind not been fixated on far stranger things. Was as if his mind he had been left on repeat, to replay all those different faces he had come to see mixed amongst the endless sea of those that looked all the same. Faces that constantly rippled, constantly changed. As if several had been trying to take it's rightful place. To those that had been far too twisted in shadows, blurred just enough one could only vaguely make out the shape of facial, features. 

These twins, It had not been the same, Their faces had been something not even this boy could perceive, as if it had not been a part of this known reality. It was as if all things that should of been their face, had been ripped free from the very fabric all things are weaved. Incompressible had been the in-between of endless possibilities. To question if their faces, had ever existed, to begin with.  If only they knew what it meant to be aware of this boy's existence, They would of never plucked that string that now set  things in motion. Events that would break the very board upon which the boy had found himself placed, and of the price all would be forced to pay.

I am currently a 2nd-year engineering student, majoring in Electronic & Telecommunications Engineering. 

Since beginning university, I am having trouble of sleeping too much. Reportedly I slept a total of 7-8 hours per day. I tried many methods to reduce sleeping hours, including exercise, coffee, food, etc, but came out unsuccessful. My parents are also not happy with what I did, saying they only need about 6 hours per day for sleep. Since my dad was a student and now is a lecturer in mechatronic department and my mom was once an IT student, they must have a lot of experience in uni compared to me, especially when we are in the same uni. Idk if I am just being lazy or I truly have sleeping problem, they (my parents) are always pestering about that and repeatedly calling me lazy despite me trying my best.

Any help for my sleep problem is greatly anticipated. Thank you. ",22,1768620149.0,EngineeringStudents,15,0.87,False

If you plan to demonstrate, there is a parking lot a couple blocks away that is free and public. There is also a blue line stop between the parking lot and the site.

The scene gets intense and the goons like to escalate things quickly. Stay vigilant, but not violent. Be ready for all sorts of non-lethal ammunitions shot at and near you indiscriminately. Pepper spray, rubber pepper bullets, flash bangs, tear gas and more.

Here is a list of essential gear:

Eye protection - goggles (also, do not wear contacts)

Lung protection - Respirator with P100 filters

Head protection - helmet 

Warm clothes (duh)

If you are in the area and want to drop off food or supplies, I recommend having everything in your front seat, give a few honks as you pull up, wave us over and hand us what you’ve got. It will be greatly appreciated.

Food/drink to drop off:

\- Hot coffee or tea and cups

\- Room temp bottles (so they don’t freeze as fast) of water, gatorade, juice

\- Pizzas, empanadas, sandwiches, etc

Supplies to drop off:

\- Large bottles of eyewash with saline

\- Hand warmers

\- Bags of salt

\- Traffic cones

I am currently (28) and my exhusband is (27)… I should start off by saying my husband and I were childhood best friends. it was never a secret that my husband had the biggest crush on me since the moment we met at my quinceñera.  As life went on, we ended up becoming more than friends at the ages of (19) and (18). However, I was only sleeping with him because that’s what I had wanted, I wasn’t looking for anything serious, especially with him since I knew he was an alcoholic and really enjoyed (night outs with his buddies).  I have always been a more disciplined person when it came to that kind of lifestyle and I knew it just wasn’t for me.Also, he was illegal, and this was a HUGE responsibility to have on my shoulders which I didn’t want. I had wanted to move out on my own, just because I felt pretty ready to live my life as an adult and get my shit together, I was also getting tired of my mom treating me like a child because I was sleeping with my friend. But then eventually I had the idea of my friend and I living together and when I presented this to my parents, my father treated it like the biggest disgrace and disappointment I had ever done and said I could only move out if I was married…. so, I did it. My friend married me with good intentions, he was through the roof, extremely happy. I on the other hand was afraid, angry of the decision I had made… ( I’ve already beaten myself up enough for this. So yes I know, I fucked up there, but let me proceed with the story)

So, because of this huge loss of control in my life for pleasing My father, I entered the marriage very upset, and my poor husband at the time was trying left and right to please me and I basically came in like a wrecking ball and unconsciously tried taking control of any aspect of my life that I could..I was always paranoid he was going to cheat on me, I hated the alcoholism.. I hate going out with friends. However, at one point he did try bringing down the alcohol and going out with his buddies. Yet, I could not get myself to stop behaving out of line. we fought constantly, over anything and everything because I caused it… I own all that I did wrong, I wasn’t the greatest wife ever.. However, I did try my best to show him love in other ways… by making him laugh, always trying to cook the yummiest food for him (granted, I didn’t always cook, we both worked 9-5 jobs) so we’d both be tired to cook sometimes, when I’d go shopping I’d always make sure to nice if he rant out of his favorite snacks or his deodorant/shampoo etc. If I randomly saw a beautiful sweater or shirt I’d buy it for him. I’d always try reminding him how much I loved him verbally and texts.

 Another problem was that I didn‘t like going out because I didn’t like being in the same vicinity as his ex girlfriends because I hated it when he would just stare at them. (I know, I was a total POS) however, I did realize that something was wrong with me.. and I couldn’t control my emotions.. but, no matter how ugly things got, my husband and I always came back at the end of the day.. we would have mini dates, favorite shows, favorite pass times together. When we did have our times together I always tried my best to make the most of it, scratch his back, run my fingers through his hair etc, all the cuddly lovey dovey things I could think of.. during the next few years I had been trying different therapists and medications so that I could get better and live my life with my husband.. I had realized how much this person never gave up on me, how much he loved me and I really really wanted to get my shit together to save the marriage… However, no medications nor therapists could help me overcome my problems. I did learn I had Depression, Borderline Personality disorder, anxiety, paranoia, you name it 😢.. and so, things did get really rocky.. I’m not saying he was a saint and never did anything wrong.. There were nights I was having dangerous mental break downs and he’d walk right past me, or he’d end up going out with his buddies and leaving me alone knowing I was a risk..... sex became less and less… He was also one of those people that thought that just because they had a job, he was the most hardworking person ever. Sometimes, he’d get off 1-2 hrs earlier than me, and I’d find him playing video games or just watching TV. He wouldn’t help clean up because to him, the house wouldn’t be disorganized if I was more organized. Also, My job wasn’t as hard as his job so I shouldn’t be tired, I’m not meeting my 40 hrs so I should have plenty of time in the day to get stuff done so if I didn’t have time, I needed to make time.. He would leave to hangout with his buddies and drink for 6-12 hrs straight sometimes, and wouldn't come home until late… It was extremely frustrating.. so we cycled like this for 7 yrs, until barely in 2024, I Finally found a therapist who was actually breaking through with me.. I started changing, learning to accept the alcoholism and his friends, waking up early to make him his coffee and lunch and basically just trying my best to be a better wife because I truly loved this man and felt everything that went wrong was just all my fault and because he hadn’t left me, I thought he was staying out of love for me…

 As I mentioned before, sex had become minimal.. and so I had been taking care of myself in that aspect because I was not about to cheat. I loved him and it was my fault he wasn’t wanting to have sex with me. He said that I treated him so poorly, how could I just expect him to make “love to me” so I thought that was fair. I had been abused before in a relationship when I was younger, so I didn’t want to pressure him into having sex with me if he felt I was out of line (since I knew how that felt)  
 One random night in Feb. 2025, I asked him if he could please send me some of our ”recording” since I was tired of the same few I had.. he was very open about it and was happy to send them to me, as I saw him open the “hidden videos” content, I happily asked if I could pick them.. and that’s when he became guarded and quickly tried deleting stuff.. I ended up losing control out of my panic state, due to knowing what was going on. We ended up getting into a wrestling match over his cellphone. This man practically gave up his life to protect what was on the cellphone. The wrestling was so bad, I tore his shirt and accidentally scratched him, I tore his pants pocket, he shoved against the walls, eventually getting away from me, out of the house and driving off… he came back later that night and explained that the videos were of him and his friends when they were younger, drunk out of their minds and they would get naked and poor ice cold buckets of water on themselves.. he hid them because he felt I would treat him as tho he was still behaving this way with his friends. I was in shock, yet confused, yet in the position of “Am I really about to believe this story” but I loved him dearly, so I accepted it and apologized for being so horrible to him and he was so afraid of me that he felt the need to hide things from me… at this time, he tried divorcing me, but I truly thought it was because of my behavior and I begged and pleaded with him to stay, that I was working extremely hard with this therapist and I wanted nothing more than to save our marriage… so he stayed. The year went on, and it was rocky, I won’t lie, but I never stopped trying. For my birthday in July he still tried making my birthday great.. and then came August, and here my life took a turn for the worst….  
 Aug 10th my husband and I had an argument again and he decided to go out with buddies since 11:30 in the morning, and was extremely adamant about me not going. So that day, I tried my best to keep myself busy, took myself for coffee, had a nice massage and ended the night with Karaoke. The entire day, my husband and I did not text a word to each other.. that night I had 3 drinks, and was crying my heart out to my friends about the situation and how much I just want us to work. I happen to look at his location and he was home, it was about 12:30 pm (this made me angry because previously he had been coming home around 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 am. Or wouldn’t come home’s he’d stay at his dad’s house) so how was I supposed to know he was actually going to come home at a good time. I drive home crying my eyes out, and  I get pulled over for driving to slow, and taken to Jail for a DUI… I didn’t get home until 4 am, and my husband was buzzed, sound asleep. I grabbed his phone and looked through everything I could possibly think of (it was clean). He did nothing to look for me as well that night, I only got 1 txt at 1 am asking if I was coming home. Then I ended up getting a 2 week suspension from work without pay, and THEN out of NOWHERE, about a few days after my suspension, he asks for a “break” he says, he can’t do this anymore, it's too much for him, he doesn’t feel sane etc.. (this was roughly the first week of September) and he needed time to think. Then, a few days later, he receives his permanent residency, I was so happy for him I reached out and asked if we could celebrate, he picks me up, he is still wearing his wedding ring, we agreed that this break was just for us to think and gather our thoughts, we would still respect the marriage. We had plans to go to Mexico together for his buddies wedding and to visit his sister, I really wanted him to see how much I had grown as a person and I told him to take the rest of September and October to think, no contact so that he could see how much I trusted him and loved him,  and to go on the trip to Mexico without me so he could breath… so we agree, the break was absolute torture for me.. but I stayed strong. In the middle of all of this, in October our niece almost died of open heart surgery so we flew out to see her. There we rekindled and he even had sex with me and was leaning on me, crying with me, sleeping in the same bed as me etc. I really thought he was coming around. Before having to come back home, I confronted him and told him I couldn’t be in this limbo anymore and needed to know his decisions. He CHOSE TO SAY “The break is done, you and I are okay!” And I was extremely happy, I stayed back to help his sister with our niece while he came back to go on his trip to Mexico. He would still call me “babe” and we'd exchange “I love you’s” he spoke to me every single day, and even sent me pictures of him over there etc. granted I was engaging the convo and asking for the pics, but he still chose to reply to me. I came back from watching my niece and I lost my job. Due to my DUI I couldn’t be “on call” from losing driving privileges. Thankfully I have a wonderful family to support me, but what was getting me through was knowing my husband was coming back to me. He comes back from his trip and basically hits me with “nevermind, I don’t want to be with you anymore” I was shocked and confused.. I had cooked us dinner that night and cleaned the house etc.. and he kicked me to the curb, I once again begged and pleaded to him to stay, so then he said “okay” And agreed to come home. But, he never did. I came to live with my parents because I was not mentally safe to be left alone, I had gone into a very heavy depression (still am). I had been constantly texting him, to reconsider and come back etc. He came to my folks house and told them “I know I came and asked you for her hand in marriage but I’m returning her” I was completely devastated.. my life was falling through my hands right before my eyes… and he asked for divorce. That very next morning, was my sentencing for the DUI, I go to register with my PO and as I walk into the door, the guy that had abused me when I was younger was the very first face I saw.. he too was there for probation and all I wanted was to run to my husband and curl up into a little ball in his arms, but I couldn’t. And all I could think was “why does the universe hate me.”

So, to get up to date to today, my husband wants nothing to do with me, all of a sudden all the hardships we went through and overcame were just too much. He can't handle me anymore (by this point I honestly hadn’t done a thing… I had become so submissive I was putty in his hands. He still didn’t want me 😞) and now he wants nothing to do with me and just wants to get the headache of the divorce off of his shoulders… I was literally once this man’s entire world and now I’m literally nothing to him. I know I have a lot of blame, and one could say “I didn’t value him when I had the chance” but I did, but having an irregularity of your emotions and no medications helping you, makes it extremely hard to not get angry or explode etc. but I never gave up the battle and had actually finally made a break through. And I envisioned a beautiful life and even wanted to have a child with him. But he chose to let me go.. I’m not looking for sympathy for those of you thinking it truly was all my fault, but I will be honest I am broken… broken down to my soul… and I can’t get myself back up… we were married for 7 yrs.. I just don’t know why he chose to give up NOW.. the only difference is that he got his residency and saw no need for me anymore, which isn’t fair to me in the end. And his friends and family are pointing fingers at me, saying that it's my loss etc. I truly feel defeated…

Since he asked for the break, he has been out and about, living his life like nothing happened.

and tonight I received the divorce papers to sign.. idk I’m just not okay mentally.. I want him to come back so much… I want to go home so much. To see my beautiful home empty and see my partner treat me how he is now, I just can’t fathom…

How do you overcome something like this?  
 not even getting closer to God has helped… I keep praying for a miracle and that he can see the woman I’ve become.. I can be a good wife and love him right. I was truly truly trying so hard, and I was changing..

# Elevate Your Espresso: The Secret Behind Every Best Buy Machine

You’ve invested in the ritual, the promise of that rich, aromatic shot, the glistening crema, the moment of pure coffee bliss. Whether you've meticulously researched every feature or simply sought the ""best buy"" for your home espresso machine, you understand that the equipment is just the beginning. The true magic, the vibrant flavor that sings in every cup, lies not just in the machine, but in the beans you feed it.

At Intelligentsia Coffee, we believe that an exceptional espresso experience begins long before the portafilter ever locks into place. It starts at the source. While many brands simply purchase coffee, we pioneered **Direct Trade**—building years-long, transparent relationships directly with dedicated farmers. This means paying significantly above Fair Trade prices for elite-quality coffee, fostering sustainability, and ensuring an unparalleled level of flavor integrity that a generic bean simply cannot match.

Our legendary **Black Cat Espresso**, for instance, is a testament to this philosophy. It's meticulously sourced and roasted to unleash a syrupy body, bright acidity, and complex notes that transform effortlessly into milk-based drinks or stand boldly on their own. And because every bean's peak freshness is fleeting, we maintain an unwavering commitment to **roast-to-order**. Your coffee isn't sitting on a shelf; it's roasted specifically for you and shipped immediately to capture that elusive perfection.

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Experience coffee roasted precisely when you order it, delivered at its peak, guaranteeing the most flavorful extraction from your machine.
*   **Ethical Excellence:** Our Direct Trade model ensures superior quality and supports the livelihoods of the dedicated farmers who cultivate these extraordinary beans.
*   **Flavor Clarity & Depth:** Meticulous sourcing and expert roasting unlock nuanced profiles—chocolate, stone fruit, and caramel—that elevate your daily shot beyond expectation.

Don't let your ""best buy"" espresso machine settle for anything less than extraordinary.

# 🗞️ WHY IS THIS NOT FEBRUARY 

Let’s address the acorn in the room.

A calm, civilized decision was made by the Squirrel Editorial Board to publish **once a month**. One issue. Plenty of time to chew, digest, and recover. February was locked in. Calendars were circled. Tails were relaxed.

Then suddenly… Copycat “news agencies” began crawling out of the woodwork.

Breaking alerts every five minutes. Articles riddled with typos. Zero jokes. Maximum AI vibes. Headlines that said nothing. Paragraphs that felt like they were written by a confused raccoon stepping on a keyboard

Reader burnout was imminent. So the squirrels did what squirrels do in a crisis:  
they screamed, spilled coffee, knocked over filing cabinets, and sprinted back into the newsroom.

This is a **Breaking News Edition** not because we wanted clout, but because someone had to save journalism.

# 🐋 AX REALLY IS A WHALE WHISPERER 🐋

For seasons, Ax carried a title that most people treated like satire.

“Whale Whisperer?”  
“Sure buddy.”  
“ZOO recruiting strong players? I’ve heard this bedtime story.”

Well. Wake up. Ax just recruited Puzz

Yes. *That* Puzz. Former Animal Control. PvP boogeyman. Spreadsheet demon. The guy rumored to be personally funding half of PvP like a one man stimulus package.

For seasons, Puzz appeared permanently enchanted by RUN. Bound by loyalty. Or blackmail. Or a very strong friendship bracelet. Scholars debated it.

Whatever spell RUN had on him?

**Broken. Shattered. Dispelled. Deleted from the patch notes.**

Puzz has joined RIP, they jumped straight into PvP homeworld, and immediately began treating it like a bonfire at a summer camp for alliances that made poor life choices.

Tiles are burning. Morale is evaporating. The map is now mostly fire and regret.

Ax didn’t just whisper to a whale. He summoned one. With receipts.

# 🔥 RIP + PUZZ = PROBLEM 🔥

Together, RIP and Puzz are currently doing what can only be described as *educational violence*. Clean marches. Ruthless timing. Zero mercy. Maximum confidence.

This isn’t a raid. This is a live demonstration

# 🤔 EVERYONE IS NOW VERY NERVOUS 🤔

So the forest asks:

Who actually stops RIP now?  
Does NOT remain loyal to RUN, or are they circling like the vultures they are waiting for PvP to fracture before scooping up survivors?  
Is this the start of a power shift… or just the opening scene before everything gets worse?

No one knows. Anyone pretending they do probably already published three “breaking alerts” about it with the wrong alliance tags

# 🐿️ FINAL NOTES FROM THE NEWSROOM 🐿️

This story is ongoing.  
The squirrels are watching.  
Binoculars polished. Nuts stocked. Slack notifications muted.

If this escalates further, we’ll be back with another update.

And to the copycat news agencies:  
Please take a nap. Or a spelling class. Or both

Pretty much toxic relationship. On and off.

Here spoiler:

>!Pheeracha (Neen), a wealthy heiress, and Ranchanlapas (Ran), a calm lawyer, enter a severe marital crisis mainly caused by Ran’s mother, Kingkamon. Kingkamon constantly insults Neen—her class, manners, clothes, and background—and Ran rarely defends her, making Neen feel unprotected and unloved. This long-term tension pushes Ran to propose divorce, leaving both women emotionally wounded and confused. They still love each other but become trapped in a cycle of anger, silence, hurt, and pride.!<

>!Ran is gossiped about at work as “living off her rich wife,” causing deep shame and loss of self-worth. Neen overhears these rumors, realizes Ran suffered alone, and breaks down. Kingkamon escalates her hostility, even trying to replace Neen with another woman (Melinya). Frequent arguments, jealousy, and miscommunication cause toxic emotional swings - sometimes coldness, sometimes intense affection and intimacy that temporarily softens the distance. Friends and family witness the deterioration but struggle to help.!<

XRP is a tool, not a treasure. It’s designed to move money quickly, cheaply, and with high liquidity.

If it were $1,000:

Extreme volatility: tiny movements would mean huge losses for banks.

Liquidity issues: banks moving large sums would push the price up instantly.

Wrong incentives: holders wouldn’t sell, less XRP circulating → less efficient system.



In other words, it would lose its purpose: it would stop flowing and become speculative, like using gold bars to buy a coffee.



Functional price range: 



double digits / low triple digits.

High enough to incentivize liquidity and prevent spam.

Low enough for fast rotation and low relative volatility.



Simple example:

Coin worth $10 → everyone uses it, system works.

Coin worth $1,000 → no one uses it, everyone hoards, system dies.",1,1768619181.0,XRPUnite,4,0.53,False

For 10 years all green waste gets trucked out of county, I am in disbelief.

What can go in my compost cart?

Zero Waste Sonoma, the local government agency that partners with the county and local cities to help reduce waste, lists items that can and cannot be composted.

What can I compost?

 • Eggshells

 • Fruit and peelings

 • Grass clippings, leaves and weeds

 • Landscape prunings

 • Meat, bones, dairy and seafood (packaging removed)

 • Pasta, grains and bread

 • Paper plates, bowls and napkins (no plastic or compostable plastic)

 • Tea bags, coffee grounds and paper filters

 • Tree trunks and tree branches (maximum 4 inches in diameter by 2 feet long)

 • Vegetables and peelings

 • Cold wood ashes

What must stay out of my compost bin?

 • Animal/pet waste

 • Bamboo

 • Barbecue ashes

 • Cactus

 • Cooking oil and liquid waste

 • Dirt, rocks or sod

 • Glass

 • Manure (from chickens, cows, horses, etc.)

 • Palm fronds

 • Pampas grass

 • Plastics, including those labeled biodegradable or compostable

 • Poison oak

 • Sudden Oak Death-infested material

 • Tree stumps

\[/factbox\]

Current regional compost facilities aren’t able to process the materials in most compostable plastic bags, even if they’re certified as biodegradable, according to the website for Recology, the garbage hauler for the majority of Sonoma County.

Sonoma County has not had its own composting facility since 2015. Zero Waste Sonoma, the government agency that partners with the county and local cities to encourage residents reduce waste, partners with four Bay Area composting facilities, shipping the county’s compostable refuse to either the West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill, Redwood Landfill in Marin County, Cold Creek Compost in Ukiah or Napa Garbage and Recycling.

“Local compost facilities are not unique in their stance of not accepting ‘biodegradable’ or ‘compostable” items, said Celia Furber, community relations and sustainability manager with Recology Sonoma Marin. “Most commercial compost facilities across the state do not accept these materials.”

Johnson added that because of inconsistencies in product labeling, the composting facilities cannot easily distinguish compostable products from conventional, or petroleum-based plastic products.

So, to avoid creating microplastics that would end up in the finished compost — much of it sold to organic farmers — the compost facility operators screen out anything that resembles plastic and then send those materials to the landfill.

The same holds true for backyard compost piles, which are too small and fail to reach high enough temperatures to properly break down the materials.

Both Johnson and Furber suggest placing kitchen scraps in a paper bag or swapping out the compostable bag with paper towels or newspaper.

“Paper products are accepted in curbside composting bins,” Furber said.

Furber also suggested keeping food scraps in a sealed bag or container in the freezer, then dumping the scraps in the compost cart periodically.

Carey, frustrated by what he calls disingenuous marketing by the composting bag companies, wonders why they’re even sold at grocery stores at all. He went to his local grocery store and told the manager they shouldn’t be selling the bags.

“I don’t like things like that happening,” he said of the mixed messaging. “I wanted the real information to get out there.”

Furber says such bags have taken over a greater share of the market especially in California, after grocery stores were forced to eliminate plastic checkout bags and seek alternatives in their place.

“People are understandably confused that green plastic bags with these labels are not accepted,” she said.",8,1768618865.0,sonomacounty,1,1.0,False

1qf1e25,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1qf1e25/i_just_got_off_an_ncl_cruisethe_differences_made/,I just got off an NCL cruise…the differences made me RCL a lot!,"When it comes to cruising, my family and I I generally stick to Royal Caribbean as our cruise line of choice.  However, there are certain destinations that RCL hasn’t made its way to just yet (or ever).  Our original plan was to take NCL on a South American/Antarctica cruise over Christmas and New Years.  Well back in Jan, we get word that the cruise was cancelled.  We didn’t see anything that was worthwhile to explore, so we opted for the Norwegian Joy during New Years.  Esp since it was heavily discounted.

Before going on NCL, many people who sailed in the past with NCL told us of past experiences: the food wasn’t that great, that the drink service was slow, and the internet sucks on board.  So I took those comments to heart and went into this cruise with kinda low expectations.

Pre-boarding:  the NCL app was rather difficult to use and not as straightforward as RCL.  Although I was able to check me and the kids in, I had issues with my wife.  We would keep refreshing and retrying to check her in but to no avail.  Finally, I logged onto the NCL website and looked at her profile…her gender was incorrect.  After switching it to female, then she was able to complete the check in process.  And we all got an 11:00 check in time which I thought was extremely lucky for the first time.  Point RCL.

Boarding:  we arrived exactly at 11:00 at the port.  And while we thought we were lucky to have an 11:00 boarding time, it seemed that almost everyone else had the same boarding time!  We waited at least 30 mins in a long line just to clear security.  Then when we made it to the check in line, that’s where we encountered the first cluster.  You see, there were two lines for passengers to check in: one going right and one going left.  The line going to the right were suppose to check in with counters 1-25 and the line going left was to use counters 26-50…or at least that’s how the setup looked.  When we reached the front of our line, the NCL employee at the front sent us to counter 22.  Well, at the same time, the other NCL employee handling the other line also sent a group to the same counter!  They reached it first and when we waited behind them, we were told to “get back in line,” by another NCL employee and “we couldn’t linger.”  We just kept walking until we found an open counter and we eventually made it to the handicap accessible counter where the lady there happily checked us in.  Then came waiting on another long and slow moving line to actually board the ship.  By now, it’s well past noon and the ship is starting to fell crowded.  Point RCL

Muster: As soon as we board, we were directed to our muster stations to check in.  That is probably my first good point for NCL so far.  In RCL, we’re suppose to go to our muster stations right away, but let’s be honest…we don’t.  Point NCL

Drink and Drink package:  Prior to boarding, I was shocked to read that NCL does not allow passengers to bring on soda or water packages onto the ship.  Since my wife and I had the More at Sea drink package, we didn’t see a issue at first esp since it seemed like the standard drink package we get with RCL.  However, we quickly realize that bottle water is NOT included in our drink package and we had to buy a case of water if we really wanted to have bottle water in our stateroom, so we purchased a 12 bottle package. Point RCL

As far as drink service goes, the speed of the getting served varied from bar to bar.  Sometimes I’d wait a minute or so, but other times I’d be waiting a long time.  Most bars only had one or two bartenders, and that included in the popular areas like the pool bar and Atrium (deck 6).  Point RCL

Drink quality wise, this is where it highly varied.  On Royal, I’m use to the bartenders make almost every drink fresh on the spot.  On NCL, most popular drinks were already pre-made.  Bahama Mama and Piña Colada were already premade and the taste varied per stationed.  In one bar, the Bahama Mama might be extremely strong and at another bar, it was a normal strength.  Point RCL.

What also caught our eye is we still had to pay the tax for each drink we order!  Now, I haven’t seen my receipt yet from the cruise ship, but I hope that was not true.

Now on the positive side of the drink package, you could get two drinks per order.  That was a huge relief knowing I can order my wife a drink without having to give her key card.  It also meant I can ask for a drink and a shot at the same time.  I didn’t do it often, but it was good to know.  Point NCL

For the kids (15 and 12), we originally did not get them the soda package because they don’t drink that much soda for it to be worth the cost.  However, when we were told that the Soda Package ($60 per passenger) also included mocktails, we bought our kids each a soda package.  And although they had a soda package, bottle water was still NOT included.  But for the price, Point NCL.

Buffet: Our first experience with the ship’s food was the Embarkation Day Buffet at the Garden Cafe.  Once again, we went in with low expectations, but that was quickly shattered.  The food being served in the buffet was delicious!  And NCL had so many varieties of food too.  My ultimate favorite food at the buffet was the Pho/Udon noodle station.  Then there was the carving station where it had a different protein every time we went: roasted pig leg, bbq brisket, Mexican Flank Steak, Italian Roasted Chicken, roasted pork ribs, etc.  Huge point to NCL!

Main Dining room:  NCL didn’t have a set dining as RCL does (if they didn’t, I didn’t figure it out).  So it was similar to My Time Dining.  On the Joy, there were three main dining rooms that we could go for dinner between 1730 and 2130.  We stuck to our usual 2000 dining time, but when we arrived at the dining room, we still had at least a 20-40 min wait for a table.  Again, this is probably similar to My Time Dining, so no points either way.

Dining room food:  NCL just recently made a change to their policy where if you want an additional main entrée, you are charged $6.  However, that’s just for the entrée.  For starters, you can still order as many as you would like.

Starters wise, they were good but small in portion size.  So for starters, Point goes to RCL.

Main entrées wise, the food was good!  With of course one exception…NCL’s version of a NY Steak.  It was def NOT a NY steak and more of a rump steak.  However, the point for taste def goes to NCL.

Now here’s what made me miss RCL a lot.  My daughter had a stomach issue and excused herself from the dinner table.  I told the server that I will take her main course and dessert to the room, so can I have a lid for both.  The server looked confused at the request and went to speak to her manager.  About a minute later, the server came back and said “sir, per health and safety reasons, you cannot take the food to your room.”  WHAT!?  “However, we cannot stop you either, so I will bring the food to the table, but I cannot give you a lid.”  That was the biggest difference to me by far on this cruise, but it wouldn’t be the last.

Late night food:  My experience for late night food has always been Sorrento’s pizza and cold cut sandwiches from the coffee shop.

The Joy…did not have a late night pizza joint.  Instead, it had a 24/7 eatery called The Local that made bar food to order (sandwiches, burgers, chicken wings, etc).  Which sounds good in theory, but then when I asked if I can take the food to go, the answer was a stern no!  If I wanted food in the room, I was told to order room service.

So all in all…I rate the cruise a 6/10.  NCL had some good points, but the things that they fell short on really made me miss Royal.  Luckily we don’t have to wait long for our next Royal cruise as we are boarding the Navigator OTS on Mar 9.",18,1768618562.0,royalcaribbean,14,0.85,False

I feel like I’m camping because I bring everything with me all the time. I’m constantly asking myself if I can lighten my load.

1qf1dlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1qf1dlx/i_somehow_found_the_confidence_to_leave_my_dead/,I somehow found the confidence to leave my dead bedroom.,"Me (33F) and my ex (36F) were together for around 4 years when I made the decision 5 years ago to end it due to the lack of sex, and more so general intimacy. I missed the subtle hand holding watching TV, the morning cuddles and obviously sex. The biggest frustration was that it felt like she didn’t ever listen to my concerns or cared enough to actually put in effort.

Even though it broke me, I knew deep down was the right decision. I genuinely thought she was my soulmate and never thought I would find someone like her , which I believe was the reason I didn’t end it sooner. I’m a pretty confident person and quite self assured but I sort of cringe at some of that relationship- I really wish I had left sooner or not put up with the behaviour I had to. She made it seem like I was obsessed with sex when all I really wanted was some cuddles or some sort of physical intimacy.

I struggled for around 6 months after the breakup, however once I picked myself up I felt confidence like I hadn’t before. I committed to the gym getting in the best shape of my life, leaned on family and friends and was the happiest I’ve ever felt.

Around 9 months post break up, my now partner and I met when we both really weren’t looking for anyone. She is attentive, the intimacy has never once wavered and she is constantly checking in with me about how we can improve as a couple and asking how I am going. The sex is amazing but it’s also the little kisses in the kitchen while cooking dinner together, morning in bed with a cup of coffee and making me feel like the most important person in the world.

Just providing a bit of hope to you all that are in dead bedrooms like I once was and felt helpless- I feel like I found my person and I would never have met my current partner if I had stayed in my old relationship that was way beyond it’s expiry date.",11,1768618532.0,DeadBedrooms,2,0.93,False

1qf17yx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qf17yx,Bed bug bites?,"Hello all, I write this in a true state of panic. 

19 days ago, my fiancé and I returned home from the holidays, and found a bed bug nymph on a sticky trap. It was confirmed to be a bed bug nymph by pest control. It was in a strange location, actually on our stairs nowhere near any bedrooms or furniture. The pest control guy did a thorough inspection of the apartment, and found no signs of bed bugs, and suggested this is a hitchhiker given its strange location being stuck on a sticky trap, and literally no other signs in the apartment. 

My fiancé and I have torn apart every thing that could harbor bed bugs. The couch, the bed, everything, dresser, coffee table. We even fully unscrewed the bed and inspected every screw, screw hole, slats, all the leg posts, headboard, you name it, and found literally nothing. I have inspected most of our furniture with the same level of detail. We isolated the bed and couch from the walls to create “bed bug island”, and put interceptor traps on the bed, nightstand, and couch. We have sprayed crossfire per the instructions on the bottle (it is legal to purchase and use where we live), including vacuuming everything before spraying. All of our clothes are in airtight bins, and everything else has been making its way through the wash and dryer, and stored in airtight bags in an unused room. We are (I guess fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you view it), moving in 2 weeks. We are getting rid of all of our furniture except our couch and coffee table, and plan to treat the new apartment upon move in. We have dealt with infesting bugs in this apartment (carpet moths, carpet beetles), despite keeping a whistle clean home, which I know has nothing to do with bed bugs, but suffice it to say I am really at my wits end. 

I guess I’m partially writing this for support, and half for a potential bite ID. I woke up yesterday to these marks on the front/slightly toward the side of my neck. They don’t itch at all. I sleep on my side, and this part of my neck is slightly elevated from the bed. I also sleep with a necklace on, and the marks are about the same width as my necklace, which kind of rest slightly upward that what is pictured while I sleep. Could this be a sign of bed bugs? Thank you. Sorry for the intensely long message. I’ve never been so stressed out in my life. And thank you, David, for having this as a community and providing your advice and support.

The sleepless nights of falling asleep

And waking up realising my bed is empty

1qf1524,https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/1qf1524/found_significant_results/,Found Significant Results,"Long story short, I'm 31 (M), have been struggling with SebDerm for years now. Typical symptoms, crazy dandruff, hair loss, redness, dry peeling around my chin, sides of nose, eyebrows and scalp. I went years without any results and finally found Ketoconazole. Did it help? Significantly, however it would be a matter of days before I'd be back to square one. Last month, I buzzed all my hair off and I tried C8 MCT oil, it's organic and the brand I got on amazon was Wild Tusker. The seb derm does not feed off of this oil. 

Anyway, I also got a shampoo shower comb - it has hard plastic bristles that really scrub the scalp nicely.

My routine for the past month has pretty much been to apply the C8 oil, just a few drops, with a few drops of tea tree (not too much of this), and then I leave it on my face and scalp overnight. Then once I shower, I use the Ketoconazole Nizoral Shampoo, scrub with the comb, and when I'm fresh out of the shower and everything is still kind of damp and soft, I'll reapply the C8 and Tea tree to my scalp and face.

Then, rinse and repeat.

I will say I've also been working on reducing my stress significantly, and mindfully, as well as seriously cleaning up my diet by way of process of elimination. (I eat, Eggs, beef, fish, butter, chicken + some probiotic foods) Pretty much an animal based diet. No carbs, as little sugar as possible, maybe a date if I get the craving. I've also cut out coffee completely as it raises stress.

The redness is gone, the flakiness is gone, and the I'm just feeling much more comfortable. This was a vicious cycle because when my symptoms popped up I would stress and that for sure made things worse. So now that I've at least been able to calm everything down, I've been able to finally reduce my stress as well.

Anyway, this might not work for everyone, but I'm seeing excellent results so far. Although, I'm sure if I stopped doing this it would likely return so it's not exactly a cure.

Hopefully someone reads this and gets similar results. I know how frustrating this is, truly.

I HAVE EXPERIENCE MIND YOU!!

Applied to this cafe like 10m by train, literal heaven. Great benefits, lovely team, I loved them and considering all the green flag ""how you know your interview went well"" it checked all the boxes. They seemed engaged, the interview was way longer than it was supposed to be, it was just GOOD. we connected, i thought to myself ""okay i really want this job, i think i'm a good candidate for it"". Everyone who i spoke to and recounted the interview to, said the same thing. Even my brutally honest no nonsense friends. Even a barista who works for the same chain cafe in a different location said I got it. Even though i was realistically tamping (pun intended) my expectations, i was hopeful.

I do the typical hospitality thing, they tell me when they'll follow up and if they dont, send a follow up email. I send one, grammar check it like 5 times for good measure and schedule send it for 8AM next day. Nothing. Then I wait a week. Typically the hiring process is mid to closing, so I send another one and schedule send for 8AM again. Again, nothing. No response, no acknowledgement at all. Not even one just to be polite.

I never had any crazy teenage romance or parties or experiences. I never partied in college or had friends I just went to class and went home.

I had a dream last night of the popular girls from my high school. One of them is a successful influencer IRL and now married to a hot guy and her bff is also successful too and they’re still best friends.

Right in time for laundry day. The new machines hare much taller and like everything it comes with an app; why everything has to be hooked up to my phone is beyond me but it is what it is. I was upstairs with cooper while they installed it but it seemed like a seamless setup and the guys who delivered it were lovely. They were working long hours that day so apparently mother gave them some coffee and a doughnut to enjoy while they were working.

I did get to do my writing, though I did start late, Not because of the new appliances but simply because I wanted to start a little later. I went upstairs at my usual time but I watched a movie up there first before I started writing. I worried that I would not have the drive to get anything done and at first there were a few moments of struggle. The intro to the scene was seamless but I could not pin down the first line of dialogue for the longest time. But, once I got past that, I found my stride. I wrote 750 words, which is very, very good for such a late starting day. Most of it was dialogue and I do think I'll change some of it tomorrow, plus description needs to be added in between, but it is a stronger start than I thought I'd manage to make today.

Sadly while I was writing to you we found a issue with the plumbing. There is a leak in the laundry room that drips into the basement. It is probably from the new washer installation but it is leaking in a place that the installers didn't touch. It is strange but at least the leak is small. We are running a test load now and we'll see what needs to be done about it in the future. It is astonishing to me how my parents can make an argument about something they fucking agree with. It is impossibly childish. Mother is worse about it than father but he still has  his moments. I just don't understand why it is so hard to hold your fucking tongue and focus on fixing the actual fucking problem.

I'm hoping that the issue is resolved enough that I don't need to listen to them bicker anymore tonight. I pray that be the case. For now, in this pleasant lull, I am going to make a coffee and try to relax. Wish me luck in that endeavour.

The bracelet on this watch is top-knotch, super comfortable, the taper on the links makes it a very strong choice as a daily watch.

I am really impressed with Longines!",2,1768616973.0,TodayOnMyWrist,1,1.0,False
1qf0oh4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qf0oh4,Two Cookies and A Coke (R.I.P. David Lynch),"Starting a new tradition and I welcome all lovers of David Lynch to join:

 I unofficially declare the next four days *The David Lynch Long Weekend of Remembrance*.


Tonight, before bed, I will be leaving out a coke, two cookies and a cigarette as an offering to the late, great ghost of David Lynch. I will be leaving these items out starting tonight January 16th (the day of his passing) until January 20th (his birthday). Personally I choose these items because they were accessible and nonperishable-ish. Alternatively one might consider a cup of coffee or a slice of cherry pie. However, whatever you think helps evoke and or channel your inner Lynchian spirit will suffice. 

\*On a more serious note, I'm feeling pretty heartbroken today. David Lynch was genuinely one of a kind, never to be replicated, and I'm just glad that I was born during the same time his work was being released. To those of you have been impacted and inspired by his work, today and everyday, I feel your pain.",3,1768616862.0,Cinema,0,0.72,False
