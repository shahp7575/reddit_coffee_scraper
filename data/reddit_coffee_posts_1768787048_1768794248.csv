1qgtd3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qgtd3i/the_archive_project5_of_8/,The Archive Project(5 of 8),"I spent a few hours by myself in the guest room to process. It didn't feel like enough distance from my aunt and my thoughts were already collapsing on themselves the longer I stayed here. I needed air. After a moment, I forced myself up from the bed and went to grab my car keys and purse off the nightstand. They were missing. My aunt must have grabbed it while I was asleep this morning. I didn't want to entertain the thought that maybe she was ordered to take them.

 I searched the room for any sign of surveillance with the hope that I was overreacting. I didn't find anything. I took a slow breath through my nose, like I could convince my body that nothing had changed. I was mid-thought when I heard a buzzing sound and immediately reached for my phone only to find no notification. It took me a second to realize the buzz sound I heard was in fact the doorbell. 

Confused, I crossed the room and pulled the curtain back to look outside. He was standing on the front steps of the house, hands shoved into the pockets of his hoodie looking like he wasn't sure he should be here. I recognized him immediately as the boy who lived next door although I hadn't talked to him in years. Growing up, sometimes I'd interact with him just to stay sane. For a split second, I considered opening the window and calling out. Not because I thought he could help me but because I needed an excuse to get out of my aunt's grasp for a while. 

I lost the chance. I could already hear my aunt's calm voice downstairs in mid conversation with him. By the time I reached the stairs, she was already closing the front door. From where I stood I watched him walk away, pausing once to look back before getting into his car. He didn't come back.

Only then did my aunt turn to face me as she spoke. “He recognized your car in the driveway. I didn't account for that.” 

I wanted to say something but the words caught in my throat. She did what she does best. She contained the problem. 

“You moved my things. My keys.” I said quietly. 

“I did. Make no mistake, you aren't a prisoner here Cecilia. But you are to remain indoors for the time being.” She responded, knowing I wouldn't argue. 

My phone buzzed and I checked the notification as another email log stared back at me. 

*Subject remains stationary. Environmental variables noted.* 

I backed away from her as my chest tightened. My pulse jumped. Fleeing wasn't an option. It never was. My aunt simply smiled at me like she was the same woman she had always been. The same woman who taught me fractions in the kitchen and combed my hair in the morning. She politely excused herself and walked to the kitchen, mumbling something about making tea and routines. 

After she left I tiptoed toward the front door, testing the gap between the frame and the carpet. If I could step outside for just a moment, maybe I'd feel better. 

Another ping cut through the silence. This time it came from the laptop that was set on the coffee table. The screen blinked. 

*Subject movement detected. Threat response noted.* 

I froze and with trembling hands, I stepped away from the door. My steps no longer felt like my own. My thoughts and actions never belonged to me to begin with. I sank back against the wall as I thought back to what my aunt had said about the burden of choice. Did she truly believe this was mercy? Freeing me from a life where I'm burdened by choice?

Another ping.

*Subject displays heightened anxiety. Further monitoring required.* 

I couldn't think without my thoughts being analyzed. I couldn't act without it being recorded. 

Without thinking, I took small steps toward the laptop to shut it. I just wanted some peace of mind without hearing it ping each time I did something. I wanted some sense of control. 

As my fingers hovered over the power off button, the screen blinked.

*Subject attempts unauthorized interaction. Response pending.*

Let's build a real friendship through shared interests and good conversation!","Hey everyone! I'm 19 and feeling that classic ""I need to expand my circle"" energy. I'm on the hunt for a new best friend or a few! The kind of friend you can tell anything to, the one you share memes with at 3 PM and deep fears with at 3 AM. A real, lasting connection.

I'm also super down for just casual, consistent chat if that's more your speed. I believe the best friendships start with simple, good conversation.

A little about me to see if we'd vibe: I'm a cozy hobby enthusiast. I love reading, getting way too invested in TV show characters, curating niche playlists, and I'm always on a quest for the perfect iced coffee. I'm loyal, a good listener, and I value authenticity, kindness, and a sense of humor above all else.

I'm looking for someone who wants to build a friendship over time someone who's okay with texting one day and sending voice notes the next. Maybe we watch a movie ""together"" online or just vent about our weeks.

If you're also looking for a real best-friend-level connection (or just a great person to talk to regularly), please send me a DM! Tell me what you look for in a bestie or what's currently making you happy.",1,1768793975.0,Kikpals,1,1.0,False

Delhi winters have gotten my lips so so chapped that lipsticks just weren’t cooperating. I saw the typsy beauty advertisement on my instagram and decided to order 3 basic shades- a pink, a red and a mauve. 

Strawberry soufflé is the red one. I absolutely love this formula. I lined my lips slightly with the mars lipliner in shade 02 and then proceeded to apply a tad bit of the product and I absolutely love what it’s doing to my lips. It blurs my lips and makes them look so cute and full. 

I’ve been trying to achieve this look for so long but never knew what products to use and I’ve finally figured it out. 

All lip products I’ve tried from typsy have been really good. 

This product is so buildable. I was wearing the pink one on Friday and it was dark because I built those layers and it stayed through meals, chai, coffee and jugs of water. 

Their highlighter and blushes are quite the letdown but their lip products are amazing. ",3,1768793702.0,indianbeautyyappers,1,1.0,False

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (Seriously, bundling flights & hotels saved us a fortune!)","**You Might Be Richer Than You Think—Here’s How to Unlock Your Hidden Wealth**

Ever feel like your savings are just sitting there, doing… nothing? Like a gym membership you pay for but never use? What if I told you that money could be working *way* harder for you—maybe even funding your dream retirement sooner than you think?

Here’s the thing: Most of us underestimate how much our savings *could* grow. A few smart moves now could turn that ""meh"" nest egg into a full-blown financial powerhouse. Let’s break it down.

### **3 Ways Your Savings Are Secretly Richer Than You Realize**
1. **Compound Interest Is Your Silent Hype Man**
   - That $500 you stashed away? If it grows at 7% annually, it could turn into **$3,800 in 30 years**—without you lifting a finger.
   - *Pro tip:* The sooner you start, the less you need to save. Time > Money.

2. **Your ""Small"" Contributions Add Up (Like a Coffee Habit, But Better)**
   - Skip one $5 coffee a week? Invest it instead, and you could have **$10K+** in a decade.
   - *Bonus:* No caffeine withdrawal required.

3. **You’re Probably Leaving Free Money on the Table**
   - Employer 401(k) match? That’s *literally* free cash. Not using it = turning down a raise.
   - *Example:* If your company matches 3%, and you earn $60K, that’s **$1,800/year** in free retirement funds.

### **The Easy Fix? Let Your Money Work Smarter**
You don’t need a finance degree—just a plan. Tools like [this one](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) can show you *exactly* how much your savings could grow (spoiler: it’s probably more than you think).

*Affiliate note: If you click the link, I may earn a small commission—no extra cost to you!*

So, what’s one small move you could make today to let your money flex its potential? Maybe it’s automating savings, bumping up your 401(k) contribution, or just *finally* checking how much you’re actually sitting on.

Your future self might just send you a thank-you note. 💌",1,1768793603.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1qgt6jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qgt6jl/hrhorror_short_story_the_man/,[HR]Horror Short Story - The Man,"Note - This is an unedited version of my short story and the revised version will be published somewhere else. This story is created by a 12 year old so don't expect much.

“The boss has called you to his cabin.”, my colleague says in a low voice. I freeze. What have I done? Why is he calling me? I get scared. But I go there anyway. My boss is very strict and whenever he calls someone, it is either because someone did something bad.

“May I come in?” I say while opening the door.

“Ahh! Yes yes! Come in,” he says in an excited and happy voice.

I sit down and look at him.”What is the reason I have come here?” I ask.

“Since you are our best employee and we can’t give you enough salary, we will be transferring you to Western Island.”

 Yes! This is the moment I have been waiting for! I always thought that I am working overtime everyday just for a low salary but now I will get a bigger salary! 

“When will I be transferring?”I say in a serious voice, hiding my happiness.

“After 2 days. I am sorry for not telling you this earlier.”

“No worries.”

“Ok, you can go now. I will send you the rest of the information in your gmail account.”

“Ok.”

“It is still 2 hours before you go. You should go now and start packing.”

“Thank you sir.”

I go outside and I close the door. Western Island! I can’t believe it! This is the best news ever!

I quickly go and pack my bag, leave this office for the last time and start my car.I actually did not like this office. The boss makes everyone do overtime and even though it is a 9 - 5 job, I come home at like 11 p.m. Maybe my new office’s boss will be good.

I rush to my car and sit in it, thinking about my new life in Western Island, knowing nothing will be wrong.Not realizing something bad will happen.

Stepping my foot in my home, knowing that tomorrow, I will leave it, maybe forever.

Walking through my house, I have a thought. I do not want to leave this house. I just can’t. I bought this house with my money after saving for 2 years. So many memories, just very hard to leave. But that’s okay. I will have to leave things behind for a better me, better life.

I change my clothes to my most comfortable clothes. Ate my leftover rice and lentils and started watching a movie to just enjoy my last moments in this house.

Tomorrow evening, watching the packers move my things into a truck, a tear drops down my face. I worked overtime for this house. I changed my mind. Maybe I don’t want to leave this house. I just can’t. But as I said, I will have to do it.

“Did something happen to you sir?”The packer moving my things said.

“No.Nothing.” I reply while wiping my tears.

Walking in the airport, I noticed that it was a lot crowded today. Today is Thanksgiving. Why did they have to transfer me on such a day?

The airplane is taking off. I have never travelled by airplane because it is expensive. I am getting scared. Another reason I did not want to travel by airplane is because I am scared I could die because of any crashes. Another reason I am scared is that I am in Ryanair.

Tomorrow morning, I reached Western Island and it looked just like I imagined. Big buildings with busy roads. The street food smells so good. As a matter of fact, I am feeling very hungry. I should go eat something first. I actually see a cafe in sight. Maybe I could eat there.

Stepping foot in the cafe, I immediately hear a welcoming sound. The cafe is so peaceful, with people studying, or even just working there. It is compact but brings me an aesthetic vibe. Everything is so expensive here. Maybe I should order an Italian pizza. I have never tasted it so I could try it.

My pizza came to my table. It has lots of cheese, pepperoni. Corn and the cheese pull is so satisfying. It has a rich aroma and it just looks so mouthwatery. 

Maybe after eating, I can find an apartment to live in. My boss is so lazy. Because he did not tell me, I could not buy or rent an apartment beforehand so I will now have to look for it. I guess I will just tell the packers to wait a little bit and then move it to my new apartment.

I spent the whole morning and afternoon and I could not find a single apartment that has an empty apartment right now. But there is just one apartment in the suburbs which has lots of empty rooms and is surprisingly good for a suburban apartment. It will take about 2 months to add all the furniture and paint it to make it perfect. I want a perfect apartment since I will be living here for a long time.

 

I will just live in a hotel for some months. The hotel is not that good. The lighting looks like it is from a horror movie. And my room is very good. While looking at the room, I felt like it was harder to breathe and something was behind me. Then I heard something familiar, I turned around but to my surprise, there was nothing. Maybe I am just hallucinating. How wrong I was. 

I thought nothing of it and changed my clothes and jumped on the bed to sleep. I was just hallucinating. Nobody could call me like that. Only one person called me like that. But I swear I could….. And these were my last thoughts before I went to sleep.

Triiiiiiiiiiing. The alarm clock rang and I hit the alarm clock shut. Oh… Today is the first day of my job after a transfer. I must wake up. I can’t be late today. 

Actually, my room looks good in the morning. I will wear the best clothes today. But I am still getting this unsettling feeling. I don’t know why. Maybe this is a new place and my mind has not settled in this place. That might be the reason. I should stop overthinking about this and just get ready.

I got ready and now I will just book a taxi and go to work.

I leave the office in my afternoon break to grab a coffee from Starbucks. My new boss is actually really good. I completed loads of work today and now I'm a bit tired so I thought that walking in a new city would make me feel better.

In the evening, I used a taxi to go home. I think I will also take some of my important things from the movers to use in my hotel such as my PS5, controller and some games because come on, what will I do sitting in my hotel room with nothing to do?

It is becoming so late. Playing these games just made the time go like a cheetah running to chase a deer. Yeah? Fast. I have not eaten food but I will not bother eating it and just go to sleep. I am seriously feeling very sleepy now. Let’s just remove my playstation and go to sleep.

When I am changing my clothes, I notice a dark figure on the floor. It had a very similar shape, easily recognizable by looking at it, well….. By me only. I rub my eyes and now it is gone.

Jumping in my bed feels so good. There is no way it was real. I am hallucinating for real. But the voice and the sound, it feels so familiar. Like I know this person. I should not overthink it. I should go to sleep.

My office day today was very normal and it bothered me more. At night, I did not hear any sounds or see things that were not there. While lying in bed, I was quite happy. I did not hear any voices or saw anything that was not there. I should go to sleep. Tomorrow, I have a lot of work to do in the office. I should sleep.

“Help me”. I hear a voice from behind. It is very familiar. Too familiar.

 I turn around and see nothing. Pure darkness. A long, extending hallway that never ends. 

From there, I see a dark figure. Coming closer and closer. Every second.

I try to scream. But I can’t. My mouth burns. 

“Johny.” I hear another voice from behind. I look behind. Nothing. The same long, extending hallway that never seems to end. 

The figure is coming closer. I try to run as fast as I can. There is an end. I am stuck.

The figure is coming closer. Closer. I try to scream as loud as I can and it comes to my face.

“Ahhhhh” I scream and wake up. Gasping for air. What was that? It was that same figure. Is it some kind of message? The figure is too familiar. I remember it vaguely. And the word Johny? Only one person called me that. Is that figure…… And I fell asleep.

When I woke up the next day. I forgot about 90% of that nightmare but that bothered feeling is now bothering me more.

I can’t focus on my office work. What was that voice? I seem to remember it but don’t know whose voice it is.

“What is it John?” My colleague says in a worried voice.

“Something bothering you?”

“Nothing.” That was the biggest lie I said in my life. I think I should hang out with Rowan. My partner in crime. I have known him since Middle School. I think hanging out with him can make my mood better.

Having spent time with Rowan actually made my mood better. I came into the hotel room feeling very good having spent time with Rowan. But still I am not getting a good vibe. I went to the bathroom to change my clothes and noticed something which made me have goosebumps.

“Help me.”. That was the thing written in the mirror. I immediately wipe it off and get out of it. What does it want? I quickly change my clothes and go to sleep.

“Help me.”.  A person who looked like in his 30s was screaming among other people who seemed to be hitting him. 

The blood was pooling on the ground. 

“How dare you embarrass me in front of everyone?” A person was saying.

“I was just telling the truth.” That man was saying.

“Nonsense!” That person cried.

They were hitting him more and more. I wanted to stop them. But my mouth was glued. I could not open it.

Then they were looking at me.

“You are next.”

I could not say anything. I tried to run. I was running as fast as I could. The walls are closing on me. I can’t breathe. They are chasing me. I can’t do anything except run and I trip over.

They come and make a circle around me.

“You will be in the same condition as him,” They said.

I woke up. Gasping. My mouth feels too dry. I notice the bottle of water on my side table and drink water.

What was that? That person felt like someone I know. I have seen him. But then I noticed. It is morning already. I think I should wake up. I turn off my alarm clock and wake up.

I cannot focus on my work today. Who was that? I remember him. I know him. His name is just at the tip of my tongue.

At night, I did not do anything and slept. I can’t let my focus lose on my job. I am just hallucinating. If I just sleep more, the voices, shadows, and the nightmares will stop coming.

I lay down on my bed, awake. I cannot sleep. I don’t know why. I am just thinking about that nightmare. That person looked like I knew him but saw him a long time ago. 

I should just sleep. Let’s not overthink this.

“Ahhh!” A man who appeared in his 30s screams.

“Come with us. How dare you do that?” Some strangers were wearing a black mask.

“Now pay the price.”

“Don’t do that. Please” A woman was begging them.

“Get off of me, you filthy woman!” The strangers kicked her.

 

I can’t speak anything. They take him to a van.

I try to run as fast as I can to catch them. They take a look at me.

“Isn’t that your Johny?” The strangers say to that man. All the strangers laugh.

“I think let's finish his game. What do you say boys?” A person who looked like the leader shouted.

 I try to run away from them as fast as I can. I scream as hard as I can but I don’t make a single noise.

There is a cliff in front of me.  I try to run sideways but they make a circle around me.

“Let’s play a game. What do you say?” The leader says. Everybody nods their head.

“The person who will kill him the fastest will get an ice cream treat from me!” 

“Such a bad destiny you got? Getting killed at just a little age.” One of them said,

I open my eyes. I can’t speak or move my body. I can’t move my head.  That same man is standing above the ceiling. His feet are dark blue and eyes, pure white. I feel like screaming as loud as I can but I can’t.

“Help me, John,” it says.

And then, it pokes out two fingers and touches my eyes. I try to scream as loud as I can but I can’t. And then it closes my eyes and I see nothing. Just darkness and me.

In the morning, I forgot a bit of my nightmare but not those words, “Help me, John.”.

Today is the 2nd Saturday of the month. The bank is closed and I should just hang out with Rowan to just forget about these things.

I use the telephone and call him. He picks it up.

“Hello. Who is it?” Rowan sounded like he just got out of the bed to wake up.

“You want to hang out?”

“Yes!” His sleepiness disappeared suddenly.

The city today is mostly empty. Even the busiest street is also empty. I don’t like this.

Until all of a sudden, I see Rowan waving at me excitedly and running towards me.

“How have you been?” Rowan says.

“Fine, thanks,” I say in a low voice.

“You are not sounding excited. What happened? Is anything bothering?”He says, sounding worried.

“No nothing.” I answer.

Hanging out with Rowan did not improve my mood. Until suddenly, when we were in a restaurant, he says,

“What happened to you?” Rowan sounds extremely worried.

“Nothing.” I said, shaking my head.

“Don’t lie to me.” He snapped.

“I have known you since middle school. Tell me, ""he says.

“I am getting nightmares and seeing a figure of a man and hearing some voices that are very familiar.” I blurt out.

“What?”

“Yes.”

“Since when?”

“Since I came here.”

“Where are you staying?” He asks. I get a feeling that I am in a doctor’s appointment because of his questions.

“In the Western Island Central Hotel,”I say.

“Stop joking. Where do you actually live?”

“Seriously! In Sector 4, remember?” How can he be so stupid? Everybody knows about that hotel. Every single person in Wes-

“That hotel is closed.” He says 

“What?”

“It has been closed for 10 years because of a killing.”

“I live there!”

“Are there other people living?”  
“Well, I normally do not see anyone. Sometimes none.”

“Well that explains it.” He sounds superior. He always has a bad habit of thinking that everybody is below him. He has always been the topper of my class. Smart, Brilliant and everything.

“You are seeing these shadows because there are ghosts in that hotel.” He says.

“DO NOT STAY IN THAT HOTEL!.” He advises me.

“But these shadows and voices and nightmares are all related to one man!”

“I may not be as smart as you but I know that every paranormal activity I am facing is related to one single man!”

“So? Only one person who was killed in that hotel is haunting you.”

“But that man is familiar!” I spoke a bit too loud. Everybody is staring at me.

“I have seen him! I know him! I just don’t remember him.”

“Who is dead in your family?” Rowan says.

“That is the main confusion. I don’t know if anyone is dead in my family.”

“I don’t know about this but let me tell you this much. Don’t go to that hotel and stay somewhere else.”

“But where? Every other hotel is expensive here!”

“Maybe you can stay in my house. I also live alone so I will be happy to have another person living in my house, especially my best friend.”

“I think I should stay in your house.” I say, sounding happy that maybe I just found the solution and the paranormal activities will be stopped. I had no idea.

Rowan’s house is a big, blue, two storey house with a garden having different types of trees. That is obvious. Rowan loves trees and he thinks that they are the most beautiful thing in the world. He is a dendrologist himself.

The inside is so beautiful. In the entrance, there is a living room with a kitchen visible and a stair going upstairs to Rowan’s room. His room has a bunk bed with the color combination of blue and pink with the stairs having drawers in each step. 

“Why do you have a bunk bed?” I ask because he lives alone.

“My sister used to live here but she is now in Cambridge at Harvard. She is smart just like me.” Rowan also has another bad habit of praising himself.

“You can sleep in the guest room or you can live in my room.”

“I will live in the guest room, no thanks.” I remember the sleepovers I had with Ron. He snores a lot.

The guest room is a small bedroom with a brown colored bed with a bedsheet of Harry Potter(as smart as he is, he is still childish) and a big closet where I can easily fit two of myself and a table and chair for work. 

I did not experience any of those nightmares that I was facing and neither a shadow nor noises. Today, I was back to being energetic in the office and I knocked out a lot of work today. My boss was very pleased with my improvement. While I was going to Rowan’s home, the hotel passed away and it was indeed closed now. The hair on my hand is straightened up at the thought of it.

Rowan came from work early because he did not have any field work. I made my special sandwich for him because he always tells me he is a better cook than me.

“It is quite tasty!” Rowan said while taking a bite of my sandwich.

“Well, now who's better?” I asked in a narcissistic voice

“Of course, mine is better than yours.” Liar

“So, are you facing some paranormal activities?”

“No, they improved.”

“Well, I told you, it was the hotel. Maybe you were misunderstanding that familiarity. It happened to a lo-”

“Oh shut up! I don’t want another lecture of yours.”

“By the way, want to play Tekken on my PS5?”

“Is that even a question? Yes!” I have always loved Tekken. It was like our favourite game from childhood. Every week, we saved up money to go to the arcade and play it. I have been scolded a lot of times by my parents because of that game.

It was 8 P.M. when we started playing the game and now it is 11 P.M. and it felt like it was only 30 minutes. I have to go to sleep now otherwise I am going to be sleepy in the office. I lie on my bed and close my eyes to sleep.  

I woke up but it was still midnight. I check the alarm clock and it is 2: 27 A.M. I am feeling thirsty but notice there is no water bottle on my side table. I wake up and go to the kitchen to get a bottle of water to drink. 

“Johny”. I suddenly hear a voice from behind. I look back and see that same person, wearing blue pants and a yellow shirt. Blood dripped from his arms and legs. His feet were blue and eyes, pure black.

“Help me,” That person said.

It is walking towards me. I go to the other side of the room and it is still following me. I try to go to Rowan’s room. That person is still following me. I open Rowan’s door and suddenly notice that it is not Rowan’s room.

The atmosphere is red and blood is pooling on the ground. I look behind and see that the door is gone but that man is still following me.

I run as fast as I can and then it also starts to run. While running, I notice my hands are gone and he is still following me. I suddenly notice another person in front of me and come to a halt.

“Jackie.” That man says and I notice that the person behind me is still there.

“I AM STUCK” They are saying in a low whisper again and again and again.

They are slowly coming towards me and I try to scream as fast as I can and then I close my eyes to stop seeing them and then I suddenly hear it.

“John. John. Wake up.” I know him.

I suddenly wake up and get up, gasping. It was Rowan

“What happened to you?”

It is morning now and the alarm clock starts ringing. I hit it to stop.

“You were screaming so I came to wake you up. What happened?”

“That man. He is still haunting me.” Still gasping.

“He wants my help. He says he is stuck. I don’t understand who he is but he is that same man.”

“Oh come on! You really have some mental issues!” He tells me.

“How come you are facing paranormal activities while I am not?” Rowan says. He has a point though.

“If it is haunting you, then that means the spirit is in our house and then it should be haunting both of us, shouldn't it?”

He has a point. If the spirit is in our house and it is haunting me, then it should also be haunting me. I don’t understand.

“Come on. Stop your sweating and get up.” He gave his hand.

“Honestly, I was just doing some research and just heard you screaming like a madman. I was scared that you got possessed or something.” He says in a funny tone. I don’t laugh.

I get out of the bed and check the outside. It was a cloudy day and it felt like it could rain any moment now. The wind is super strong and it is getting quite cold.

“Today is my field work so I will be home late.” He says. 

“Ho- how l-late?” I ask while stuttering. 

“At 10 o’ clock at least. And also, stop your stuttering. It is not that deep.” Rowan starts to leave the room but suddenly comes to a halt.

“When are you going to your office?” He asks.

“At 10’o o'clock, I will book a therapy session.”

“What? Why?” Rowan asks.

“I can’t let these nightmares affect my job. I have to go.”

“Okay, suit yourself. I am getting a bit late for my field work so I am going. Sorry” And after saying that, off he goes.

I called the hospital for the therapy session and I booked an appointment for the evening. I am very lucky to have got a same day evening appointment because the hospital I am getting an appointment in is very famous.

I quickly finish my work in the office and then go straight to the hospital.

While driving to the hospital, I still think about that thing. After lots of thinking, only one question comes to my mind, Who is that man? I was so deep in thought that I almost crashed into a person.

I entered the hospital for a reason that I never ever thought about in my life. The idea of me having mental issues.

I go to the room where the therapist is. The room is cozy with a sofa and a chair in front of it which is yellow in color. I suppose this is the place where the therapist sits in. There is a fireplace in the end which is not being burned because it is not that cold. 

The therapist comes. The therapist is a female doctor wearing a black coat with a dotted design and an Ipad in her hand. I think she uses it to take notes of her patent.

“Hello!” She says in a low pitched voice.

“I suppose you are my patient today?” I nod.

She sits in the chair comfortably and the therapy session starts.

“So, how are you feeling right now?”

“Good.” She nods and scribbles something in her Ipad with an apple pencil.

“Is this your first session?” She asks.

“Yes. Never thought I would come here.” I answer by trying to not sound uncomfortable. But she sees through it.

“Don’t worry. Sit comfortably. I am not going to eat you or something.” She laughs but I do not.

“So, tell me why you came here.”

“I am hearing some voices and seeing some figures that are actually not there-” I stop so that she can write her notes then I begin again, “I am also having nightmares for a few days.”

“Since when are you facing these issues?” She asks.

“Since I came here. Around a week,” I stop again. “I came here because these things were interfering in my job and I did not want to lose it so I came here for a solution.”

“Okay-” She writes some notes in her pad and starts again.

“What kind of voices were you hearing?”

“Of the same man. I think I know him but I just can’t remember. I know him.” I say.

“How often does it happen?”

“Most of the day, I am working in my office and when I come home at night, I see these things but there is another thing.”

“What?”

“I used to live in the Western Island Central Hotel when I just transferred to this city.”

“What?” Even she is shocked.

“Yeah, I also felt that way when my best friend Rowan told me about this and he asked if I could stay in his house and I said yes but I am still getting nightmares and seeing figures or hearing voices.”

“That is messed up. Is your friend also facing these issues?”

“No. Only I am facing them.”

“Okay, so that means there is not a haunted spirit in the house.” She laughs while saying this.

“So you are having nightmares or seeing things or hearing voices of the same man and you have been hearing them for a few days and you used to live in a closed hotel and your friend is not hearing those voices.” She says. I think she does not believe my story.

“And you also said you do not remember that man. Can you please tell me what you saw in your nightmares?”

“I don’t remember much but I can recall the figure calling me ‘Johny’ and ‘Jacky’.”

“Any more information?”

“In one nightmare, I saw him getting hit by people who were forcing him into a van and a lady whose face I could not see was holding their legs begging to let him go but they kicked her. I also went to save him but those strangers pointed to me and said to that man, ‘Isn’t that your Johny?’ and I remember more about what I did.”

“Can you recall someone calling you ‘Johny’ or ‘Jackie’?”

“That is the main confusion I am facing.”

“Maybe it was your close family member.”

“I am sorry if I am getting personal but did something traumatic happen in your childhood?”

“Hmmm” I concentrate on this question a lot, thinking about the answer and I still can’t remember.

I shake my hand and she sighs while writing on her Ipad. She asked me questions for another hour but in the end, she said that maybe it is because of the stress and I should sleep more, do journaling, and eat better food. I wasted my money for nothing. 

As I drive back home, I still think about that conversation and that same sentence is ringing in my head, “Did something traumatic happen in your childhood?”.

I drive to Rowan’s home and park my car there. Who is he? It is that same question lingering in my head. 

I went inside the house and changed my clothes into a comfortable one and I saw that Rowan’s PS5 was just in the living room so I went to play.

As I opened Minecraft(he bought it) on the PS5, I heard my phone ringing. I picked up the phone and saw it was a call from mom. I instantly curl up into a smile. She had not called me for ages! I pick up the call and answer.

“How are you doing? Is Eastern city good?”

“I am fine” Such a liar I am. 

“I have been transferred to Western Island mom. I tried to call to inform you but you wouldn’t pick up the call.”

“What!? Western Island is really expensive, can you live here? Can you afford food here? ”  
“Oh mom obviously I can! Also, I will get higher salaries now as I was promoted to a manager. My boss thought that I should become a manager since I am so good at this work.”

“Bless you my child! Say, are you getting holidays when you are asking?”  
“Yes. The boss here is so good.”

“I also miss your dad.” Mom said in a lower voice. A bell rang in my head.

“I miss having arguments with him.”

“My dad?”

“Yeah, you forgot. Your dad went missing when you were a small child.” She said in a low voice and started crying. My dad. That is why I thought I had seen him.

“I never brought this subject up because you never asked and whenever you did, I said he is in another country for work.”

“I thought it was the time to tell you.” She was crying so much.

“I am sorry for not telling you and you had to know this way!” I was thinking of a way to stop her crying.

“Hey, hey. It’s not your fault. I understand.”

“Thank you.” She said while wiping her nose.

“You know. I remember when those people came home and tried to put your dad in a van.” She said, finally calming down.

“I begged them to let him free and he kicked me.” The dots are connecting.

“When they left, I called the police but it was too late. They had gone. The investigation is still going on.”

“How did he look like?” I asked like I was investigating her. I was indeed.

“Oh John, how do I tell you? He looked very beautiful and had curly hair with a moustache which was very big and he always liked to smooth it out. It was his habit.”

“Yeah, he did look beautiful.”

“Are you living well with Amy?”

“Yeah, your sister is always helping me. I am absolutely living well.”

“Oh wait! I have to get going! Sorry. Call me later.” And after saying that, she hung up the phone.

 

I sit still with my phone close to my ear. My dad. That person is my dad. Why is he stuck and what help does he need? I check the time on my phone. It is currently 8:34 P.M. I play on PS5 for a few hours and then I go to bed.

While I go to the bed, I see that same figure looking at me. I look at him, not scared anymore. That figure is coming closer to me.

“Dad?” The figure suddenly stopped and it seemed to be nodding. Tears start rolling down from my eyes.

“Why are you bothering me? Why do you want to destroy my life?” The figure starts to shake its head.

“Yeah I know. You wanted help from me. What kind of help huh? Tell me? Tell me and leave me for once!”

The figure went close to the mirror and said, “I am stuck”. I get angry again.

“What kind of help? What does it mean?” I say slowly, regretting that I talked to my father for the first time in my life like this.

“I am sorry for talking to you like this. How are you stuck?”

It writes in the mirror again, this time saying, “I can’t go to the afterworld.” I suddenly remembered something my mom used to say.

*“People who are dead must be given liberation to go into the afterworld and attain peace. But, for liberation, the body must be needed.”*

My dad went missing and nobody found his body till this date. I looked towards the figure, and tears started rolling down my eyes. All the time, he was giving me signs that he needs help and he is stuck and I did not understand any of his hints.

The figure wrote in the mirror again, this time saying, “Sorry for bothering you.” and the figure started to disappear a bit.

“No, please don’t go.” I say while crying and the figure is almost disappearing and I try to touch him but my body passes through his smoke and he disappears. I cried for a long time until Rowan came home and listened to my story. I did not erase the words from the mirror and he believed my story. Mainly because I did not have that beautiful writing which was written on the mirror.

“I am such a shame!” I say while sobbing into Rowan’s shirt.

“I spoke to him rudely and he left not wanting to hurt me!”

But Rowan made me stop crying and I went to sleep.

6 months later, and the nightmares and all the paranormal activities are gone. I hear none of them but still, I cannot focus on work. That meeting with dad made me so guilty about it that I became depressed. My apartment was finished but Rowan still made me live in his house because of my depression.

Rowan always tried to cheer me but I never became happy. I was just existing, it felt at that point. Until suddenly, one morning, I got a call from the police saying to come to the police station. Was I going to get punished for making my dad’s spirit go away? I drove to the police station speeding through my car.

When I came, they told me the news.

“We have found the remains of a body in the Perinia lake in Western Island and after investigation and DNA reports, we found it was your dad, James Parker’s body.” I freeze. I don’t know whether to be happy or sad but I was feeling a bit happy. My father can finally be free and can go to the afterlife. 

As I came home after the last rites and looked at the mirror to see myself, I smiled for the first time in a very long time. Finally, my father can be free and go to the afterlife, peaceful at last.

**The End**

Laptop: Lenovo LOQ 15IRH

What happened:
Everything is working fine. I was transferring photos from my phone and then since it's a few min job for the laptop, I went and made coffee. Since I'm not playing games, I did not plug it in to AC. The phone charged itself and laptop died.

When I plugged it in, that's where the 0% charge started. Unit is 1.5 years from purchase. And 6 months out of warranty (battery only).

What have been done:
1. As I do with drained Lithium batteries, I left it to charge (turned off) for a couple of hours. Nothing changed.

2. Pressed power button for 30 sec-1 min to drain residual power - no effect after starting up the unit.

3. Removed the battery. Cleaned it since it's open already. Used the laptop. Turned it off. Removed charger. Held power button again, and installed the battery. Left it to charge then still nothing.

4. I am not convinced that an update could fix this issue but just to remove that in the equation (a friend insisted and was dumbfounded when it's still the same) drivers and BIOS are up to date. It's win11, it will update itself given enough time anyway.

TLDR:
Laptop died. Wont charge again after.

I don’t drink, I don’t club, and I’m not looking for nightlife. I genuinely just want connection: getting dressed, meeting at a coffee shop, walking around, talking, exploring, and actually being out in the world. If we get really close, I love the kind of friendship where we can take a long walk, then come back home and stay up late talking. But early friendships (like the first 3–4 hangouts), I don’t want to invite people to my home. Home feels intimate to me, and I prefer to build trust first.

What I’m struggling with is that a lot of people I meet seem to prefer “just come over and sit inside” from the beginning. I’m not trying to generalize by culture or nationality—I’ve just personally noticed this pattern across different people I’ve met. And I keep wondering: am I the odd one for wanting to go out and treating my home as a private space until the friendship is established or even like we’re super close?

1qgt1lf,https://i.redd.it/4kdb7xz168eg1.png,Dumping My CEO Husband AND His Annoying Little Heir Was the Best Career Move I Ever Made!,"Chapter 1  
  
  
""Get rid of the baby.""  
  
  
One second, Wren Kingston was on top of the world, lost in the joy of her pregnancy. The next, her husband's words sent her heart crashing into a deep, dark ocean.  
  
  
""What... what did you just say?""  
  
  
""Ronan, this is \*our\* baby...""  
  
  
""Orion found out you were pregnant and he completely lost it—threatened to jump off the balcony! He still hasn't accepted you as his new mom, how the hell is he supposed to accept a new baby?""  
  
  
Orion. It was always about Orion... Ever since she married Ronan, Wren had bent over backwards for his son, but Orion just hated her for it.  
  
  
And now he was coming after her baby, too!  
  
  
""Ronan, Orion is your son, I get that. But isn't this your child, too?!""  
  
  
Tears streamed down Wren's face, the bitter taste of them catching in her throat as her voice broke.  
  
  
Ronan Grey went quiet.  
  
  
After a long, heavy silence, he just said, ""We can always have another one later. Wren, please, be reasonable. We have to put Orion first.""  
  
  
That one sentence lit the fuse. All the anger and frustration she'd been swallowing for months finally exploded. ""I'm not being reasonable?!""  
  
  
""You're right, I'm not reasonable! It wasn't reasonable to marry you! It wasn't reasonable to keep believing your empty promises! And it sure as hell isn't reasonable to think I could actually keep my baby!""  
  
  
CRASH—She swept the lamp off the nightstand. Then she cleared her vanity, the desk... everything went flying.  
  
  
And Ronan just sat there on the edge of the bed, his eyes heavy, just watching her. Watching her lose it, watching her completely break down.  
  
  
And as she cried, something inside Wren's heart died, too.  
  
  
She and Ronan had met at a tech conference in Chicago.  
  
  
She was just a nobody back then, and he was the star of the show, the guy everyone crowded around the second he walked in.  
  
  
Ronan was twelve years older, and she was totally drawn to his calm confidence and the easy way he talked to people—a charm that only comes with age.  
  
  
Later, she'd spilled coffee all over her notes, and while she was frantically trying to clean it up, he handed her a handkerchief, his voice gentle. ""Hey, take it easy. You got this.""  
  
  
He had a hint of a smile in his eyes, and from that moment on, she was hopelessly hooked.  
  
  
She knew he was divorced, had a son, and had plenty of smarter, more successful women after him. But she went for it anyway, like a moth to a flame.  
  
  
At first, Ronan kept his distance, acting like a mentor. That changed one rainy night when they both worked late and he gave her a ride home.  
  
  
In the dim light of his car, she finally got up the nerve to ask, ""Mr. Grey... would you be annoyed if someone like me... had a crush that was way out of her league?""  
  
  
After a long moment of silence, he gently rested his hand on top of her head.  
  
  
He said, ""Wren, you're so young.""  
  
  
She answered right back, ""I don't care.""  
  
  
And that was the beginning.  
  
  
Ronan remembered all the little things she liked. He'd have her favorite soup sent to the office when she worked late, and he'd listen patiently to her dumb little problems, always giving the perfect advice.  
  
  
She was addicted to the way he made her feel safe. With him, it felt like nothing in the world could hurt her.  
  
  
A year later, they got married.  
  
  
But after the wedding, everything was different.  
  
  
He was always busy, always traveling for work. He missed her birthday. He wasn't there to take care of her when she got sick.  
  
  
His son, Orion, treated her like the enemy, throwing tantrums and making trouble until Wren always, always backed down.  
  
  
And now... she was expected to back down again. To get rid of her own child.  
  
  
What a fucking joke!  
  
  
Seeing her curled up on the floor, something in Ronan's calm expression finally cracked.  
  
  
He went to her, trying to pull her into his arms.  
  
  
But Wren shoved him away with all her strength. ""Don't touch me!""  
  
  
Ronan just held on tighter. ""I promise, this is the last time. As soon as Orion...""  
  
  
But this time, before he could finish his empty promise, Wren cut him off, her voice ice-cold. ""Fine, Ronan. I'll get the abortion.""  
  
  
""I've made up my mind. I wouldn't want my child to turn out like Orion anyway.""  
  
  
Wren met his gaze, her eyes swollen and red. In that moment, she felt nothing. The spark she once felt for him was completely gone.  
  
  
""Ronan... I want a divorce.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Wren pushed him away with a trembling hand, shakily got to her feet, and walked straight into the bathroom.  
  
  
The click of the lock echoed in the quiet room, drawing a final, clear line between them.  
  
  
The hot water washed over her, but she leaned against the cold tile, not knowing where the shower ended and her tears began.  
  
  
After a long time, she dried off, put on a clean pair of pajamas, and finally unlocked the door.  
  
  
A single dim lamp was on in the living room. Ronan was sitting on the couch, his back to her, perfectly still.  
  
  
He held an unlit cigarette between his fingers, fighting the urge.  
  
  
Wren didn't even look at him. She walked right into the master bedroom.  
  
  
CLICK. The sound of the deadbolt sliding home shot through the silence.  
  
  
Ronan sat there like that for a long time. Eventually, he walked to the bedroom door and raised his hand to knock, but he hesitated, letting it hover for a second before dropping it to his side.  
  
  
He turned and walked out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door open.  
  
  
The bitter cold of the winter night rushed in, making him flinch.  
  
  
He stood by the railing, staring down at the blurry city lights and the few cars on the street below, the wind filling his lungs and leaving them empty again.  
  
  
He couldn't name what he was feeling. He just knew he'd lost control of everything and had no idea how to fix it.  
  
  
He was rarely backed into a corner like this, a cliff at his back and a cliff in front.  
  
  
A tiny flicker of hope danced in the wind—hope that she might wait, that she'd be like she always was before. That after the anger and the tears, she'd come back and curl up in his arms, smiling.  
  
  
Wren stepped over the mess on the floor, stripped the tangled sheets from the bed, and slid under the covers, killing the light.  
  
  
Darkness flooded her vision. After the storm of emotion, she was just exhausted. So tired she wished she could just sleep and never wake up.  
  
  
Tucked in the warmth of the blankets, she quickly passed out.  
  
  
Strangely, she slept a deep, peaceful sleep, like the bottom of a dark lake, and didn't wake up until morning.  
  
  
A sliver of gray morning light cut through the curtains, and Wren forced her eyes open.  
  
  
Any last bit of hope she'd had for Ronan was gone, erased by the night. She washed her face, put on some clean, loose-fitting clothes, and opened the bedroom door, shivering as the cold air from the living room hit her.  
  
  
Ronan was still on the balcony, his back rigid, like he'd been standing in the freezing wind all night.  
  
  
She kept her head down and walked quietly, trying to sneak past him and get out of the apartment without a sound.  
  
  
She didn't want to see him. And she definitely didn't want to hear his voice.  
  
  
""Where are you going?""  
  
  
Ronan turned around. His eyes were bloodshot, his face gray and exhausted from a sleepless night.  
  
  
""The hospital.""  
  
  
Ronan's throat tightened. ""I'll go with you.""  
  
  
""Don't bother.""  
  
  
Ronan stepped in front of her, his voice tight with a desperate kind of stubbornness. ""Don't be like this, Wren. An abortion is a serious thing.""  
  
  
Wren's heart froze solid.  
  
  
He just assumed. Without a second thought. It was so clear she held no real place in his heart, that she just didn't matter.  
  
  
She closed her eyes for a moment, then kept walking without a word.  
  
  
Ronan grabbed his coat and followed her out the door.  
  
  
The hospital air was cold and sharp with the smell of antiseptic.  
  
  
Check-in, waiting, tests... the whole process was strangely, horribly calm.  
  
  
Lying on the operating table, she felt a deep chill coming from the surface beneath her.  
  
  
The anesthetic slid into her vein, a cold wave of sleep spreading through her blood.  
  
  
Her mind started to get fuzzy, but her heart felt clearer than ever, like the drugs were peeling back a layer of fog.  
  
  
She couldn't bring a child into this world unwanted by its father, a child whose very existence was a burden to another.  
  
  
Ronan wasn't the one who was wrong. She was.  
  
  
She was the naive one who thought love could conquer anything. She was the moth who flew into the flame, and she was the one who made it impossible for this baby to ever be born.  
  
  
Maybe she and Ronan should never have even started.  
  
  
If they hadn't, there wouldn't be this disaster now.  
  
  
She had poured every last bit of herself into this relationship.  
  
  
From sweet hope, she'd fallen into a spiral of anxiety, waiting, and desperation... She'd become someone she didn't even recognize.  
  
  
She was a rubber band stretched too thin, right at the breaking point.  
  
  
She couldn't do this anymore.  
  
  
She had to end it. Stop the mistake here and pull herself out of this mess before she actually went crazy.  
  
  
She had thrown her whole heart into the fire, and now she would pull it back out, piece by painful piece.  
  
  
The anesthesia slowly wore off, her mind rising up from a deep, dark ocean.  
  
  
Wren opened her eyes. The ceiling spun above her.  
  
  
""You're awake? How are you feeling? Just rest here in the recovery room for about half an hour.""  
  
  
The nurse's voice sounded a million miles away.  
  
  
Her hand automatically went to her stomach, where a dull, heavy ache echoed deep inside her.  
  
  
She just nodded, letting the nurse help her onto a gurney and wheel her into the observation room.  
  
  
Half an hour later, the world snapped back into focus.  
  
  
""You're all set to go.""  
  
  
The nurse helped her out of bed. Her feet felt unsteady on the cold floor, and a dull pain flared in her chest, making her vision swim for a moment.  
  
  
The recovery room door opened, and Wren walked out, her lips white, one hand pressed to her stomach.  
  
  
Ronan was standing right there. Who knows how long he'd been waiting. The second he saw her, his face tightened with worry and he rushed over.  
  
  
""You're in pain, I know. Let's get you home so you can rest.""  
  
  
He reached out for her, but she slapped his hand away.  
  
  
""Don't touch me!""  
  
  
She braced herself against the cold wall, forcing herself to walk. One step at a time.  
  
  
She would do this on her own.  
  
  
For three years, she had depended on him for everything, trapping herself in his world, a prisoner of waiting.  
  
  
Now, her eyes were open. Even if the pain felt like it was grinding her bones to dust, she would walk through it herself.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Ronan followed silently, half a step behind her. He reached for her a few times, but she knocked his hand away every time.  
  
  
So he just followed, keeping a careful distance, like he was guarding a priceless vase with a crack in it—terrified to get too close, but unable to walk away.  
  
  
At the hospital entrance, a brutal gust of wind hit them, full of tiny ice crystals. Wren's thin body flinched, her face so pale it almost disappeared against the gray sky.  
  
  
""You're going to get sick.""  
  
  
Ronan immediately took off his overcoat and tried to put it around her shoulders.  
  
  
""I don't need it!""  
  
  
Wren blocked him with her arm, the heavy wool of the coat scraping against the back of her hand.  
  
  
""Wren, stop being so stubborn. You just had a procedure. You can't get sick.""  
  
  
Ronan's voice was strained, a mix of frustration and real pain.  
  
  
Wren turned and finally looked up at him.  
  
  
Her eyes were still puffy and red, but they were completely out of tears.  
  
  
""I'm not being stubborn,"" she said, her voice thin in the wind. ""I just... don't need it anymore.""  
  
  
Ronan's eyes widened slightly, his fingers tightening on his coat.  
  
  
""I don't need your coat. I don't need your concern."" She paused, her gaze going right through him to the bleak sky beyond. ""And I don't need you.""  
  
  
Ronan opened his mouth to say something, but the sharp ring of his phone cut through the frozen silence between them.  
  
  
He glanced at the caller ID, and his brow twitched.  
  
  
A familiar woman's voice came through the phone, frantic. ""Ronan, you have to get to the preschool, now! Orion is having a total meltdown, he won't stop screaming for you. The teachers can't do anything, I can't do anything! Get over here, something's really wrong with him.""  
  
  
Ronan's expression darkened, growing as heavy as a storm cloud.  
  
  
His knuckles were white around the phone. His eyes darted from Wren's paper-white face to an image in his head: his small, sobbing son at school.  
  
  
He was trapped. Caught between them.  
  
  
Time stretched out in the freezing air, every second scraping by like a razor.  
  
  
He squeezed his eyes shut. When he spoke, his voice was heavy, like the words took everything he had. ""Okay. I'm on my way.""  
  
  
Wren felt a sting in her chest, but it was gone in a second. A pebble dropped into a dead sea. Not even a ripple.  
  
  
She looked at him, her pale lips parting. ""Ronan, tell your lawyer to draw up the papers. We're getting a divorce.""  
  
  
Ronan's eyes shot wide. ""Wren, don't joke like that. You're not thinking clearly right now. Let's just wait, we can talk when you're calmer, okay?""  
  
  
""I am perfectly calm,"" Wren said quietly. ""I've never been calmer in my life.""  
  
  
She said it like a simple fact: ""We were a mistake from the beginning.""  
  
  
""I was the naive one who jumped in without seeing how complicated this would be, and I backed us both into a corner we can't get out of.""  
  
  
Her voice trembled, just slightly.  
  
  
""I pushed you to the edge of a cliff, and I forced myself to walk a tightrope.""  
  
  
""I get why you're torn. I get your responsibility to Orion, the guilt you feel. From where you're standing, maybe there wasn't a better choice.""  
  
  
She looked at him, her eyes brutally clear. ""I can understand it. But that doesn't mean I can accept it.""  
  
  
""I can't accept a marriage where I always come second to a child's feelings. I can't accept my baby being thrown away because of a \*potential\* problem. And I can't accept living my own life constantly waiting, compromising, and knowing that I'm the one who will always be sacrificed.""  
  
  
She took a shallow breath, the cold air stinging her lungs.  
  
  
""Let's just stop here. We're both exhausted.""  
  
  
With that, she stepped forward and raised her hand, flagging down an approaching taxi.  
  
  
The door opened. She got in without a single look back.  
  
  
The taxi pulled up to the front of her apartment building.  
  
  
Wren paid the driver and pushed open the door.  
  
  
The wind hit her instantly, thick with snow. Her body swayed, and her hand instinctively went to her stomach.  
  
  
A dull, heavy ache was still radiating from deep inside, a constant reminder of what she'd just lost.  
  
  
She shuffled into the elevator, swiped her key card, and unlocked the door to the apartment.  
  
  
The place was silent, exactly as she had left it that morning.  
  
  
The mess from last night's breakdown was still all over the bedroom floor. You could almost feel the fight, the tears, the heartbreak still hanging in the air.  
  
  
This place she'd once filled with so much hope now felt like a giant, cold tomb for three years of her life, her love, and the child she never got to meet.  
  
  
She didn't turn on the lights, just letting the gloomy daylight trace the shapes of the furniture in the dark.  
  
  
She went into the walk-in closet, pulled out her biggest suitcase, and started packing.  
  
  
Numb. She pulled out her things, one by one, methodically erasing every trace of herself from the apartment.  
  
  
With every item she packed, the home felt a little emptier, a little less hers.  
  
  
Halfway through, she was out of breath and had to slide down the cool surface of the closet door to sit on the floor.  
  
  
Waves of pain washed over her lower stomach, and a deep, hollow cold spread through her body.  
  
  
She looked around the master bedroom, the room she'd lived in for two years. Her eyes swept over the messy floor, over the big king-sized bed.  
  
  
How many nights had she waited here for him, her excitement slowly fading into just being lonely? How many mornings had she woken up in his arms, thinking that this was forever?  
  
  
At twenty-two, she dove headfirst into his steady gaze, a moth to a flame, thinking she had found the man she would lean on for the rest of her life.  
  
  
At twenty-four, she became his wife, full of hope and nerves, thinking she had finally built a home of her own.  
  
  
This room had seen her at her most passionate, and it had seen her slowly burn away all of that passion, hope, and courage in a relationship that was never equal.  
  
  
Waiting for him to come home. Waiting for him to have time. Waiting for Orion to accept her. Waiting for a future that was never going to arrive.  
  
  
She'd been like a faithful believer, praying for a miracle that was never coming.  
  
  
Now, the dream was over. There was no miracle, just a bloody, painful separation.  
  
  
Leaning on the dresser, she slowly pulled herself to her feet.  
  
  
She couldn't stay here another second. The air was too heavy, she couldn't breathe.  
  
  
She moved faster, stuffing the last of her clothes into the suitcase and zipping it shut.  
  
  
Standing up, she gave the room one last look.  
  
  
There was no longing, just relief. The relief of being done with the exhaustion.  
  
  
She dragged the suitcase to the front door and took one last look at the mess she was leaving behind.  
  
  
She left the key on the entryway table and walked out the door.  
  
  
Behind her, she left a locked door. And behind that door, a complete wreck and a life she could never go back to.

My husband had a job opportunity that he wanted and he talked to me about which I appreciate. But he went and told his manager he’s leaving without understanding his salary at his new opportunity. It was a cut which we knew but to the dollars and cents is way lower. He was excited and again told his manager and “new boss” he’s taking it. He didn’t sign anything. After talking to him I told him about our finances we or even himself  can’t live on his new salary of 2.8k to 3.5k a month hopefully. When we have full time day care, his car note is 900 and other bills for himself I can do my own bills. His current job pays great. Where he can afford all of that and more. So it hurt my heart to tell him that we have bills. I know his dream but I can help you find another opportunity, so he declined that job and said I was right, and thank you. Said I saved the family. He hugged me and the past few days been great. I’ve been loving and helped him with his car, letting him know to refinance bc it’s expensive. Even now for a non luxury car. 

So fast forward today. At dinner I’m watching the baby eat. I left my water bottle on the coffee table. He was annoyed how the LR looked so he start to like panic straighten up. He’s movng my shoes, boot for my foot and all. He comes to my water bottle and said “here” I said no please leave it in coffee table.” He said “no you sitting over there.” 

I said “I know but keep it over there.” He’s like fighting me - I forgot what he said next but I said “well your cup of water is right there in the coffee table too” And he said “I’m going back in there.” And I said “me too!!” He says “I’m going now though!” He said “I’m stop bc you trying to fight with me!” 

I’m like annoyed I said no like leave my bottle there. So baby got done with food and I took her to him. I was annoyed. He’s like “you okay?” I said I was annoyed that you going back and forth with me about the water bottle. 

He like upset and started to get mad. I just nicely expressed I was annoyed, and he mad bc I said that. He said sorry but it was not genuine. It’s like he saying it to be done. I walked away, and I came back to talk him why his vibe change? Why you mad? (Like I’m chasing his feelings(

And he didn’t give an answer. But just acting annoyed not looking at me. And him questioning why I came back in there. He’s annoyed I’m still talking about it. He says he didn’t care. I said I get you don’t care but I do. I felt unheard and challenge after a simple request. 

He got mad, and I texted him and said I just want to be heard. Not be greeted with anger when I say that I’m annoyed with what you did. Understanding, I love you, I get you, look at my face. Not a hand rubbing head annoyed at me.  

I said all that and he’s said okay sorry. 

So I told him to come to the room to get baby. He comes in not say a word. Grab toothbrush and walked out. Not a hi baby or hi wife. it’s like that. So I walked out. like he giving me silent treatment, 

And that makes me shut down even more. Like I’m stupid for helping him about that job should let him figure it out since he wants to yell at me and be upset. I wanted to talk about his finance tomorrow and I don’t need to do that now. I feel like he didnt respect me when I said no first time.

It’s always one sided. I try to help him allll the time. Tell him to reach out to payroll to see how much you get paid, help figure out a lower payment ( he wants this I’m not controlling these are things you would think about- like what my new salary. And he didn’t get a clear answer but told his boss he’s leaving for said job!) but today when I was having issues with my resume with Word format and he see I’m frustrated he’s like how about you Google it. It’s never him taking the step to try to research and help me. He knew what the issue was. But couldn’t take a moment to help me figure it out BUT I would help him. I would google it for him. Today literally made me sick. How stupid of a women am I. Always helping him, saving him. But he disrespect and don’t even help me. I even showed him the issue and he’s like idk! Not even trying to help me and he work in excel and word all the time. 

I feel so stupid bc I’m so loving and kind and when I just want a small respect or even  if he doesn’t agree with me I still want understanding, a hey baby I see I may hurt you let me give you a hug, let’s put it behind us. Like I don’t get that. I get greeted with anger

1qgszti,https://www.reddit.com/r/AEO_AkuparaAI/comments/1qgszti/the_golden_prompt_problem_why_ai_visibility/,The Golden Prompt Problem: Why AI visibility tracking is fundamentally harder than SEO,"One of the core challenges we're solving at Akupara AI — and something every brand will face soon.

In SEO, Google gave you the answer sheet. Search Console showed exactly which queries brought users. You had a map.

In AEO? You're drawing the map yourself. Blindfolded.

The chicken-and-egg problem:

→ You need golden prompts to track visibility

→ You need visibility data to know which prompts matter



And the dimensionality explodes fast:

\*\*Query × Location × Product × Intent × Modality\*\*



Let me break that down:

\- ""Best coffee shop in Austin"" ≠ ""Best coffee shop in Boston"" — LOCATION

\- ""Best CRM for startups"" ≠ ""Best CRM for enterprise"" — INTENT  

\- ChatGPT ≠ Siri ≠ YouTube AI search — MODALITY



A regional business with 20 base queries, 10 locations, 5 products, 4 intents, and 3 modalities?

That's 12,000 prompt combinations to consider.



You can't track everything. But you can't pick randomly either.

I wrote a detailed piece on how to think through this systematically: [https://medium.com/@anil\_iitkgp/designing-golden-prompts-for-ai-visibility-4177037f6a2d](https://medium.com/@anil_iitkgp/designing-golden-prompts-for-ai-visibility-4177037f6a2d)

I kept sleeping too long or not wanting to get up and I wasn't quite sure how to kick it, so I opted to just throw my bed out and I took my blankets and pillow and slept on a couch in my room. 

 I lived with my mother, I was 19 at that time, but I remember I kept that up for a year, then dumped the couch when I felt like that wasn't enough. Started sleeping on the floor. Slept in one corner and another couple months in another and I repeated that up until I was around 23. I had a couple alternative beds too. I briefly slept on drywall and that was ok, until it split open and dumped the dust and rock all over the floor; had a cot that broke and a folded tarp.

 Came the time I was 24 I got a desktop computer and an office chair and I started sleeping in it, awkwardly. A friend of mine who owns a coffee shop gifted me one of the leather seated chairs and I pushed that against my office chair and made a makeshift bed. 

 Since I've been doing this? I sleep like 3-4 hours, which made early shifts easy to manage and I've been less prone to just want to lay around. Makes me realize I'd probably handle homelessness fine. I have slept in the car once or twice when my household drove me nuts and I have slept in random public bathrooms on one or two occasions. I can just sleep wherever now. 

 I don't sleep right in beds anymore. I went with family to a hotel and there was beds for each of us, but I took the couch. I don't find comfort in beds anymore.

I had a lot of health challenges in the last couple of years and have had 3 surgeries (including on for sepsis and endometriosis) and have been hoping to help my fertility as well. 

I am currently doing intermittent fasting based on the Fast Like a Girl book and am building up to a 3-5 day water fast (with electrolytes) over the course of the next 2.5 months. My goal is to achieve maximum stem cell activity to potentially repair my fallopian tubes, a polyp in my uterus and scar tissue issues. 

I’ve heard to sustain a fast longer if you need bone broth or MCT oil and some whole milk in coffee that that won’t stop ketosis (because it doesn’t raise insulin, I think?) but technically breaks the fast because it’s calories. I’m not quite sure how those things work together. 

If I break the fast with calories does that stop stem cell activity or is it being in a state of Ketosis that heals the body… maybe this is a Ketosis vs.  autophagy question?

POV: Natasha (Black Widow)

​I didn’t hear a floorboard creak. I didn’t hear the hum of the ventilation change. One second, I’m staring at the steam rising from my coffee, thinking about the next mission, and the next, there’s a woman standing inside the drywall.

​She smiles, and it’s not the kind of smile you want to see in your own kitchen. ""Want to see a magic trick?"" she whispers. Before my hand can even reach for the blade hidden under the table, she’s gone—back through the wall like she was never solid to begin with. On the counter sit two photos. They’re candid. Too candid. Clint and I are smiling in them, a split-second moment from just a heartbeat ago. My skin crawls. She was watching us from inside the architecture itself.

​POV: Clint (Hawkeye)

​I was half-tuned into the news, watching the ticker at the bottom of the screen, when the air in the room just… curdled. You get a sense for when you're being watched, but this was different. Then she’s just there.

​She comes through the wall like it’s made of smoke. No bang, no debris. Just a pale woman with a grin that makes my bow-finger twitch. She drops two photos on the island and vanishes. I pick them up, my hands actually shaking a little. It’s us. Me and Nat, caught in a frame from a tenth of a second ago. I didn't see a flash. I didn't hear a shutter. If she can get that close without me noticing, we aren't as safe in this Tower as I thought.

​POV: Lady Death

​The molecular density of the wall feels like cool water against my skin as I slide through. It’s so quiet in here, save for the soft hiss of the kettle. They look so human, so temporary, sitting there with their hot drinks.

​I decide to give them a little jolt—a reminder that I am always just a layer of paint away. ""Want to see a magic trick?"" I chirp, watching the color drain from their faces. I leave the little souvenirs on the counter—frozen moments of their lives that I plucked from the air. By the time they realize I’ve left the photos, I’m already back in the shadows of the hallway, watching them realize just how close I really am.

First, my friend who plays explained it to me. I am NOT a competitive person, and once I realized it’s largely collaborative, I was intrigued. 

Then, I became friends with a cast member on Dropout TV who sometimes appears in their D&D series. I watched their episodes because I love their improv, and became even more intrigued. 

And then, of course, the most recent season of Stranger Things came out so I rewatched all 5 seasons, and was like — fuck yeah, I want to play this game. 

But I didn’t think I knew anyone who would be interested in playing, much less anyone (who lives in my town), who knew how. 

But, I have a close group of 12 friends. We get together biweekly for coffee, celebrate holidays together, etc. 

I offhandedly mentioned to this group that I wanted to play D&D, and not only does one of my friends know how, they’ve been wanting to try out being a DM!

I loved the theory, but honestly? Nothing was clicking. Everything felt like wishful thinking until I tweaked my process to focus on a total overhaul of my physical magnetism and inner self-assurance.

I decided to try a ""triple-threat"" sensory approach. I grabbed a notebook and started scripting a single phrase over and over: ""I radiate peak attractiveness and unshakable confidence."" But here’s the key—I didn’t just write it. I did three things simultaneously:

 \* Scripting: I filled pages with the affirmation.

 \* Vocalizing: I spoke the words aloud with conviction.

 \* Cinematic Visualization: I played a high-def ""movie"" in my mind of exactly how people would react to the new me.

Fair warning: At the start, I felt this wild, intense pressure in my skull—it felt like my neural pathways were literally being forced to reroute. It was a bit jarring, but I pushed through.

The shift was almost instant.

That same afternoon, the energy in the room changed. I caught women staring—not just a glance, but actual noticing. I figured it was a fluke until it started happening daily. Within weeks, I went from being invisible to having people approach me and hand over their numbers without me saying a word. The biggest win? My year-long cloud of depression finally broke because my self-image had fundamentally shifted. I’ve been consistent with this for a year now, and it’s like I’ve unlocked a ""creative mode"" for my life.

The Protocol:

If you want to try this, don’t skip a step. You have to Write, Speak, and See all at once. If you’re aiming for a glow-up, don't just ""think"" about being hot—visualize a specific person coming up to you in a coffee shop and asking for your contact info. Feel the paper of the notebook, hear your own voice, and see the look in their eyes.

Consistency is the engine here. Trust the process—it’s a total game-changer.

Understanding the ""Head Pressure""

In psychological terms, what you described—the intense pressure during a new mental exercise—is often associated with Cognitive Dissonance. This happens when:

 \* Current Belief: ""I am depressed/unattractive.""

 \* New Input: ""I am confident/attractive.""

And it isn't just the total spend, but he category of food is also impacted.

> Ultra-processed, calorie-dense foods -- the kinds most closely associated with cravings -- saw the sharpest declines. Spending on savory snacks dropped by about 10%, with similarly large decreases in sweets, baked goods and cookies. Even staples like bread, meat and eggs declined.

1qgsc5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1qgsc5w/just_off_celebrity_reflection_and_i_was_not_a_fan/,Just off Celebrity Reflection and I was not a fan. I went on a similar trip last year on RCCL Voyager. Here are my quick thoughts.,"I liked this cruise, but I didn’t love it. If this had been my only cruise experience, I honestly might have walked away feeling a bit meh about cruising in general. The weather wasn’t great, which didn’t help, and the activities and entertainment options were not as expansive as we were hoping for.

That said, embarkation and disembarkation were extremely smooth and efficient, including on port days. Service, for the most part, was exceptional. The ship itself was immaculate. They were constantly cleaning and somehow very stealth about it. Kudos.

The ship and stateroom

We had a midship balcony with three people in the room. The room itself was fine. Our steward said she would put the bed up during the day and down at night since we left the couch as is, but after the first night that never happened. It didn’t bother us, but it’s something to note.

We asked for wine glasses and had to repeatedly ask, and she always seemed annoyed. Normally stewards make note of requests like that, so it stood out. On the positive side, they did provide three robes and added a third chair on the balcony, which we appreciated.

I really missed having a true promenade. There were some cute tucked-away spaces like the library and hideaway, but they were small. Overall, the layout felt chopped up. The casino is tiny. The martini bar was cool, though everything there is over the regular drink package pricing. We also enjoyed the Sky Lounge.

Entertainment

We had a comedian onboard who was pretty good, but we saw him twice and the material was very similar, even though one show was adults only. There were cocktail-style singers scattered around the ship, a couple of game shows, a few karaoke nights, one silent disco, and one ABBA singalong. After midnight, the ship was mostly quiet.

Food

The food was okay. And to be fair, they’re feeding a lot of people, so expectations were reasonable. There were some good options and some not-so-good ones in both the main dining room and the buffet. We ate in the dining room three of four nights. The appetizers and desserts were consistently better than the main courses.

Ship movement

The movement was not pleasant. If you’re prone to seasickness, this may not be the right ship for you. Since sailing, I’ve read reports about vibration issues and stabilizer use on this ship depending on conditions. Who knows. Just be prepared with patches, Bonine, and Dramamine, especially for sleeping.

The biggest annoyance: upselling

The upselling was relentless. We had the regular drink package, and for the first two days, every single drink order came with a pitch for the premium package and how much better it was. Eventually I started ordering by saying something like, I’ll take the $12 rosé since I’m not on the premium package, and they’d laugh it off.

I ended up paying a total of $10 extra the entire cruise by covering the difference. I can’t imagine how pushy it would feel without a drink package at all.

The same thing happened with specialty restaurants. Staff were constantly walking around trying to get you to book, yet the restaurants were always empty. It felt like a waste, especially when the included dining options were so limited. I wish they’d just charge everyone a little more upfront and include more restaurants.

What I did like

The martini bar and Sky Lounge were highlights. Appetizers and desserts in the main dining room were consistently good.

The coffee shop was my favorite spot onboard. The coffee was much better than buffet coffee, and the main dining room had solid café lattes. Specialty coffees were included with my non-premium drink package.

The Spa Café was a great find later in the cruise. They had turkey sandwiches and other options, which were perfect if you wanted something lighter, healthier, or just less crowded for lunch. And they have smoothies \[included with the premium package\].

The Persian Garden was another positive. I enjoyed the sauna, steam room, and heated loungers. I was excited to use the spa showers to get ready. I was able to get complimentary scrub one day, which was wonderful, but my friend was told it would cost $19. The shampoo was broken, there was no conditioner, and I had already lugged everything up, so that part was disappointing. So I only used the showers once but did use the Persian Garden several times. Be prepared to wait for a lounger.

Final thoughts

This was a nice cruise with excellent service and a beautifully maintained ship, but it didn’t fully win me over. If you enjoy a quieter, more polished vibe and don’t need a lot of variety or things to do, you may enjoy it more than I did.

The plane reached 650 miles per hour, which is very fast in plane terms, so I reached Newark in just 4 hours; I don't know why the universe wanted to send me back here so fast. Now I'm stuck in Newark. I've been at this airport a lot of times and it kinda sucks... I don't think I'd live around here. I look atrocious because I haven't been able to brush my hair for hours but no one will see it so it's fine. Some of my relatives think I have too much hair and have wanted me to cut it off for years but I refused because I need a lot of hair to protect me from bad vibes in the environment. When the plane landed, my water bottle went flying and almost hit some poor guy's leg, but that was better than what could have happened. He was watching that Southpark episode ""Boobage"" which is all about boobs and I was kind of forced to watch it also. The woman in it has huge fake boobs which looks awful in my opinion; in fact this looks just as bad as the misshapen and floppy ones that a lot of overweight women have. The Southpark shit reminded me of an unfortunate drunken incident where I accidentally made a super politically incorrect joke in front of a bunch of California hippies while watching Southpark. I think the only reason it didn't end badly was that they were too drunk to remember it, but it was funny to me at the time. And my non hippie friends thought it was funny too - although they shut me up to avoid chaos. I won't be able to sleep until at least 1am which kinda sucks, I already miss my nap in the big airplane, and now I'm surviving off of Redbulls even though they aren't even that good. I'm just scrolling X, where I have my fake male identity account, to pass the time. There's nothing interesting on there right now, though. Just constant posts and videos about the anti ICE protests which seem to have spiraled out of control. Protestors are trying to stop arrests and ending up in the hospital, breaking into churches and interrupting church services, accusing random people of being ICE or ICE supporters, and harassing people on the street. It seems like some of these people have a death wish - or no survival instinct at all - but it's just tiresome to me. Trump's ""mass deportations"" shit wasn't real; it was just a promise he made to get votes. In reality, he is deporting fewer people than Obama, and that's why he's making such a show of it; the ""show"" is meant to convince stupid people that the mass deportations are actually happening. That's why the Trump admin has posted so much about it... when in reality their numbers suck compared to Obama's. Biden was the only one who abandoned the border since the border was basically open under his administration; now encounters at the border are down but deportations remain slow. In one video, a deranged white woman was upset about the deportation of a sex offender, and that's insane if real. But it's whatever... not my problem since I don't live in these cities. I just want to sleep tbf. I heard my brother caught a lot of fish today but I won't be there for the fish tacos this time. You can catch a lot of cod and other white fish there despite all the government regulations. I once caught some tiger sharks on accident but those are harmless - just kinda cool. It's just the giant sharks that scare me. Some woman was attacked by one near Bailey Island, Maine, where our OG beach house was (I was supposed to inherit it but my mom's cousin's crazy wife went to war over it). I think she died in the attack. The big sharks are getting more aggressive due to how we destabilized the ecosystem 

Time to enjoy some turbulence... but nothing will be worse than the time I got stuck in an airplane bathroom during sudden severe turbulence.

Click-clack morals, clean-cut tricks.
Not at war, not blood, not bones,
But what you eat and who you phone,
How you dress, how you kneel,
What you crave, what you feel.

They hiss, “Discipline.” They spit, “Decency.”
Over coffee choices. Curtains. Consistency.
You skipped meat? You wore black?
You loved too hard? You leaned right back?
Oh clutch the pearls, alert the town,
Someone lived and didn’t bow.

If it doesn’t hurt you, if it doesn’t bleed you,
If it doesn’t chain you or steal or feed you,
Why the fuck is it your holy crusade
To audit the joy someone else has made?

They preach in diets, they judge in clothes,
They count orgasms, they measure roles.
They moralize naps, aesthetics, tone,
Who texts first, who pays loans,
Who leads, who follows, who kneels, who bends,
Like pleasure itself must make amends.

Meanwhile— Kids are hungry.
Bodies are cold.
Justice is auctioned.
Truth is sold.

But don’t look there. That’s “too complex.”
Better scream at a stranger’s harmless sex.
Better rage at a kink you’ll never see
Than face a system built on cruelty.

They foam at mouths over consensual things,
While landlords choke and empires swing.
They scream at lovers, they sneer at food,
They shame survival, softness, mood.
They’ll crucify you for how you cope
Then shrug at cages, bombs, and rope.

Because it’s easier, neat, and clean
To police a life you’ve never been
Than to rip the rot out root and stem
And admit the world is fucked by them.

So they chant, they rhyme, they moralize,
Tiny tyrants in borrowed ties.
They want obedience, not repair.
Control, not justice. Noise, not care.

If your life choice doesn’t touch their skin,
Doesn’t tax their breath or count as sin
By any metric grounded in harm,
Then shut the fuck up. Lower your arm.

Save your sermons. Save your shame.
There are real fires. Say their names.
Until then, keep your standards small
And stop pretending you’re righteous at all.

Because while you’re busy clutching rules,
The world is burning, run by fools,
And history won’t remember your scorn
For how someone ate, loved, dressed, or mourned.

It’ll remember who screamed at crumbs of joy
While the house collapsed.
And called it moral.",1,1768791060.0,u_Carb0nFox,0,1.0,False

With **Google Gemini NotebookLM**, you can research, structure, and write complete presentations in minutes — all for free.

No subscriptions. No trials. No credit card pop-ups.

Just results.

These two free AI tools from Google — **Gemini** and **NotebookLM** — work together like a creative and analytical dream team.

Gemini handles ideas, writing, and creativity.  
NotebookLM organizes, structures, and connects information.

When combined, they make building presentations faster, cleaner, and more effective than ever.

This is not another AI gimmick.  
It’s a system that genuinely replaces hours of manual work.

Let’s break down how it works step by step.



# What is Google Gemini NotebookLM?

Let’s start with what these tools actually are.

**Google Gemini** is Google’s version of ChatGPT — a generative AI that can write, summarize, and brainstorm ideas. It’s built right into Google’s ecosystem, which means it plays nicely with all your files and tools.

**NotebookLM**, on the other hand, is Google’s intelligent research assistant. Think of it as your personal note-taking analyst. You can feed it PDFs, Google Docs, transcripts, or even URLs, and it turns that content into summarized, searchable insights.

Together, they solve one of the biggest productivity problems today: information overload.

Instead of bouncing between Google Docs, ChatGPT, and PowerPoint, you can use **Google Gemini NotebookLM** to do everything — from research to writing to slide creation — in one seamless workflow.



# Research with Google Gemini

Go to gemini.google.com.

You don’t need a paid account or extension. Just sign in with your Google account.

Once you’re inside, think of Gemini as your brainstorming partner.

Let’s say you want to make a presentation about **AI automation for small businesses**.

You type something like this:

“Create a 10-slide presentation outline about how AI automation helps small businesses save time, attract more customers, and grow faster. Include real-world examples and simple explanations.”

Within seconds, Gemini generates an outline — intro, sections, examples, and even conclusion ideas.

But here’s the trick: don’t stop here.

Most people take that output and jump straight into PowerPoint. That’s a mistake.

Gemini gives you a strong starting point, but to make it unique and data-driven, you need to refine and organize that content.

That’s where NotebookLM comes in.



# Organize and Enrich with NotebookLM

Head to notebooklm.google.com.

Create a new notebook and name it something like “AI Automation Presentation.”

Now copy the entire outline Gemini just created and paste it into NotebookLM.

You can also upload PDFs, text files, or even add links to articles. NotebookLM will read and summarize everything automatically.

Once your content is uploaded, ask NotebookLM:

“Create a 10-slide presentation structure about AI automation for small businesses, including benefits, examples, and action steps.”

In less than a minute, you’ll have a professional structure with headlines, bullet points, and logical flow.

Each slide will have a clear topic and a few key talking points — perfect for visual design later.

You can then refine it further:

* Ask NotebookLM to summarize your files.
* Ask it to extract key insights.
* Ask it to compare sources.
* Ask it to expand on case studies.

NotebookLM turns scattered notes into organized knowledge.

This is where the **Google Gemini NotebookLM** combo shines — Gemini helps you ideate, and NotebookLM helps you structure.

Now you’ve got clarity.



# Write the Actual Slide Content with Gemini

Copy the slide structure NotebookLM created.

Go back to Gemini.

Now tell it:

“Write detailed, conversational slide content based on this outline. Each slide should have a short heading, three clear talking points, and one practical example.”

Gemini will produce complete slide content — ready to paste.

You can refine it further:

* Ask Gemini to simplify complex sections.
* Request industry-specific examples.
* Add a tone instruction like “make it persuasive and friendly.”

The result?

Full sentences, clear takeaways, and practical examples that feel human — not robotic.

This step alone saves hours of rewriting and editing.

By combining the two tools, you’re essentially doing what an entire content team would do in an afternoon — in under 10 minutes.



# Design Your Slides

Once Gemini has written your content, it’s time to make it visual.

You can choose any of these three methods:

**Google Slides** — Free, simple, and fully integrated with Gemini. Just paste your content in and add visuals or charts.

**Canva** — Use Canva’s AI presentation generator to design professional layouts. Replace the filler text with your Gemini content.

**Gamma** — A newer AI presentation platform. Paste your content and it builds slides automatically with minimal editing.

The design step is now the shortest part of the process.

Because your structure and writing are already solid, you can focus purely on visuals.

This is what makes **Google Gemini NotebookLM** a complete presentation machine.

It’s not about replacing design tools — it’s about feeding them with perfect content.



# Why Google Gemini NotebookLM Works Better Than ChatGPT Alone

ChatGPT is powerful, but it’s not made for data organization.

It can generate text, but it doesn’t remember your sources or structure across long documents.

NotebookLM changes that.

It stores your research, links, and notes all in one place — and you can talk to that information like it’s a teammate.

Gemini then adds the creative spark — turning that organized data into polished, persuasive content.

NotebookLM handles logic.  
Gemini handles storytelling.

That’s why **Google Gemini NotebookLM** is more than just another AI pairing. It’s a new workflow that bridges creativity and structure — the two things most professionals struggle to balance.

You’re not switching between apps or re-copying text. Everything stays connected.

And because both tools are built by Google, they’ll only get more integrated over time.



# Real Use Cases

Here’s where **Google Gemini NotebookLM** gets exciting.

You can use it in almost any content-driven role:

* Agencies creating client pitch decks
* Entrepreneurs writing investor presentations
* Coaches building training programs
* Teachers creating visual lessons
* Marketers preparing webinars
* Consultants summarizing client data

Each of these use cases involves the same bottleneck — turning research into polished slides.

This workflow removes that bottleneck completely.

You can go from idea to final slides in less time than it takes to grab a coffee.



# My Real Workflow with Google Gemini NotebookLM

When I build decks for clients or training sessions, I follow this exact sequence.

Gemini gives me the research and ideas.

NotebookLM organizes that information into structured slides.

Then I feed it back to Gemini for clear, audience-focused writing.

Finally, I use Google Slides or Canva to format it into a professional deck.

The key is speed and clarity.

Instead of trying to write and design at the same time, **Google Gemini NotebookLM** separates those steps perfectly — so I can focus on message first, visuals later.



# Why This Combo Is a Game-Changer

The real power of **Google Gemini NotebookLM** isn’t in the tools themselves — it’s in how they help you think.

They free your brain from repetitive tasks.

They turn chaos into structure.

They make creativity fast instead of frustrating.

If you’ve ever felt like you have too many ideas but not enough time to turn them into something real, this combo fixes that.

You don’t need to be a designer.  
You don’t need to be a writer.  
You just need a clear workflow — and these tools provide exactly that.

This is where most AI users go wrong. They use one tool at a time.

But real productivity happens when you combine them.

That’s how you 10x your output without 10x the effort.



# The Next Step: Scale Your AI Systems

If this workflow feels like a cheat code — that’s because it is.

But here’s the thing: it’s just the start.

Once you understand how **Google Gemini NotebookLM** fits into your workflow, you can build full automation systems around it — connecting it with tools for client onboarding, marketing, or data analysis.

That’s exactly what we teach inside **AI Success Lab** — a free community where we share SOPs, automation frameworks, and over 100 real AI use cases for business growth.

Join here: [https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/](https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/)

Inside, you’ll see how business owners and creators are using tools like Gemini, NotebookLM, and others to save hundreds of hours every month.

You’ll get the templates, workflows, and systems that make AI a real competitive edge — not just a shiny toy.



# FAQs

**Q: Is Google Gemini NotebookLM really free?**  
Yes. Both Gemini and NotebookLM are 100% free to use with your Google account.

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**  
No. Both tools are browser-based and work on desktop or mobile.

**Q: Can I use this for clients or business projects?**  
Absolutely. Many agencies and freelancers already use it for decks, reports, and proposals.

**Q: What makes this better than ChatGPT alone?**  
ChatGPT is great for short tasks, but NotebookLM turns your long-form research into structured, contextual knowledge. When combined with Gemini, you get both quality and speed.

That’s the point. Gemini and NotebookLM handle the heavy lifting. You focus on the message, not the formatting.



**Final Thoughts**

**Google Gemini NotebookLM** isn’t just another AI update — it’s the biggest shift in how presentations, reports, and business materials are created.

The future isn’t about working harder.  
It’s about connecting the right tools.

And with Gemini and NotebookLM, you’ve got everything you need to turn ideas into polished output — fast.",1,1768790445.0,AISEOInsider,0,1.0,False

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Descaling the coffee machine fixes it temporarily, but the bad taste returns after a week or two. I even tried switching to a more expensive machine, but the result was the same.

I did a water hardness test using a basic kit, and it showed the maximum hardness level. From what I’ve read online, this is mostly an aesthetic issue that might cause some appliance wear, but it usually isn’t a major health concern.

1.	Should I get a more accurate test to find out the exact hardness level? Is there a specific hardness level at which it could pose health risks?

2.	Can I file a complaint with the town or local water authority? Would they actually do anything? I’m not sure about the source of our water here.

3.	Are there any inexpensive ways to improve the taste of my coffee? Is anyone else dealing with this problem?",0,1768790433.0,nova,8,0.36,False

Theres hope :),"I’m a 43-year-old divorced woman, and I never thought I’d be writing this kind of post (little bit from the norm of this subreddit) but I want to share my story, to offer some optimism that age-gap relationships CAN work and partly explain why, for me, dating younger has actually been easier. Perhaps you can relate? Yes, the sex is great too, but that’s not everything – as someone who went through a divorce someone younger can can remind you parts of yourself you thought you lost and make you feel whole again.

I was one of those that followed the ‘life script’.. had everything planned + mapped out. Started a professional career, worked my way up, married someone at 27, had a child, bought a house.. yet despite what society tells you…was not happy, divorced 5 years later. Missed out on a lot of ‘living’ and experiences. Looking back, I wish I had known sooner that life is a sandbox, do whatever you’re capable of; be brave and slow down because age is just a number.   

My current relationship has changed me. Theres liberty and I feel more free. I appreciate his open mind and his refreshing outlook.. so if you’ve ever felt stuck, going through the motions and haven’t TRULY got over the hump, keep reading. (or if you are lazy skip 3/4ths for the things I learned)

So since my divorce, I’ve dated or have had a few serious relationships. My prev relationship was overprotective and coupled with other issues I didn’t gel with so we ended it. I find dating men my age often came with unresolved baggage: divorce, bitterness, rigid expectations, or a sense that compromise was beneath them. Then also, having kids myself, it was also difficult to merge family dynamics especially if they had kids too. Honestly, feels like men in their 40/50+ want younger or are half checked out mentally and can barely groom themselves lol. Now, I wasn’t looking to date and never even thought bout dating younger, but yet… then this happened.

My first interaction with him was honestly 2 days after I ended my previous relationship..serendipity or maybe this was the universe giving me a sign of hope? We met at a local community/neighbor summer event a year ago; movie, food trucks etc. I went alone with zero expectations of anything just to get out of the house. He was there volunteering, running around making sure people had what they needed.

At the end of the night, I was waiting for crowd of people leave, so I wouldn’t be stuck sitting in the parking lot in my car. We made eye contact, and ended up chatting while the lines were funneling out. Just a normal conversation about the event, community and eventually we got to talking about each other. No flirting, no agenda. Not awkward small talk. It really felt natural ..just us two talking for 20 minutes by the parking lot while everyone was pretty much gone. We connected on facebook and I didn’t really think much of it. 

Over next few months, we would exchange small talk messages on facebook but.. The universe does this funny thing (more serendipity?) Aside bumping into each casually whether driving or one of us walking in the neighborhood. I kept running into each over the next couple of months randomly. E.g. I went to a café on other side of town, I saw him but I didn’t say hi. I was at an art gallery pulling out of the parking lot, again saw him but he never saw me. Just random places and coincidental timing...now, I’m not into any voodoo but again..serendipity, life was probably gently nudging me down a path that I should be listening to.

One day, he asked if I wanted to grab a coffee to catch up sometime. (I don’t even think he was asking me out). I admit I put it on the back burner but juggling a kid who plays multiple sports, work travel and my own personal stuff it's a handful. Eventually I felt bad as months went by. But what changed my mind was *how* direct and patient he was which I didn’t expect. No pressure or weird lines. Just, “If not, no worries at all. I enjoy talking with you either way.” That patience ended up being a theme.

We finally grabbed coffee. Hung out for a couple hours at the café and went for a walked. I found it really cute how he remembered the little things I'd casually mention from texts and the first time we met; what I like and can kind of understand me despite it only the 2^(nd) face to face conversation between us.. He teases me on a few things about using splenda in my coffee (something I brought up during neighborhood movie night) and even now it never feels like he makes me feel bad or being judged with things he may not align with. I have had dates react to me so quickly to the smallest things like a turnoff. After hanging out I got a really good sense of who he was as a person. We share a lot of similar interests or have overlap (this makes things so much easier as we hung out more).. but he also opened me up to new perspectives in our discussions that I wouldn’t have otherwise thought of which was refreshing.

Ladies…you should be tell a lot about another person after the 2^(nd) encounter. To me, he was/is a really thoughtful and it is reflected based on his actions, genuinely a good person and not trying to hide anything. I even told him about my divorce, how dating afterward felt like navigating a maze where the rules kept changing and always having to readjust. (if you know, you know). He listened. Not with the performative nodding I’ve grown used to, but with curiosity. He wasn’t threatened or make me feel bad about myself by my past..again I didn’t feel judged. Overtime, the connection didn’t feel inappropriate. It felt honest…and again just natural and comfortable talking to him. If you are in this position and meet someone like this; lean in to this more because that’s when I became more open idea of dating younger.

Also, if you can’t tell, patience and communication has been KEY.

Few months later, he eventually asked to go for dinner because I was stressed and just life. I was still hesitant and would make excuses or reschedule because my kid was having a rough day or unexpected things pop up, he didn’t sigh or guilt me. No passive aggression. No scorekeeping…again with the patience and being understanding. I had even went on a few dates around my age, and like always disappointed. Deep down, I think I may have been avoiding him like the high school girl we all once were.

Things like opportunities or people that I recognize are rare, I tell myself I shouldn't take for granted. You shouldn't either. Capitalize on the opportunity. You should too.

I said to myself, what do I have to lose? I admit, leading up, I was uncertain and really nervous actually. But here is the catch ladies; **THEY ARE JUST AS NERVOUS TOO**, you’re not alone. What really helped was I knew who he was already, not going in blind and off a dating app. Tip: I kept reminding myself how natural conversations and how he was genuinely a good person with a lot of green flags..and honestly better in many ways than most people I had dated up on until that point. The reminders eventually made me so much more comfortable but above all.. him asking me out gave me a boost of self-confidence, I hadn’t felt since my breakup.

Once we started being around each other more, I kept waiting for the catch. The immaturity. The insecurity. The inevitable moment where the age gap would feel obvious. Instead, what I found was someone who ACTUALLY listens, is thoughtful AND communicates… which has lead to us being 8 months together so far, our energies just click because he simply just wants things to work (less ego) and its been a really fun! – do I know where things are going to go? No but for the first time the uncertainty feels kind of okay... No more ‘life scripts’ and rigid with following how things “should” be like I once did.

**Here are some things I’ve noticed about myself**

\-       You can learn a lot and they can teach you a lot of new things, just like you can teach them

\-       I see things from a different lens and open minded, he’s positive and encourages me

\-       Have more confidence to do things and feel less ‘stuck’ in life

\-       We do more active things which has been good for my mental health and fitness

\-       I have a bit more time because he has a willingness to take some burden off my plate

\-       More time meant more flexibility to do things and actually make some more money and financial flexibility

\-       Stopped trying to ‘keep up with Joneses’ by living within my means; don’t have to keep up with appearances

Now, some of you may be asking..did you feel awkward around peers and letting people know? We actually kept it low profile and eased our way in. People don’t need to know but again, communication is key. Have the hard discussions and be clear what you are comfortable with and what you two would like to be.. but honestly, **WHO CARES WHAT PEOPLE THINK.** If both people are genuinely into/compatible with each other, ages stops mattering. Chemistry and character are what make it work and matter more than numbers. We need to normalize this. Not every age-gap relationship is a crisis or a power imbalance. Sometimes it’s just two adults meeting where they are, without apology.

The sex? – yes I’m sure everyone wants to know. In short, it’s been amazing and icing on the cake. He is in shape (never been with someone in shape like him, its hot) It has been really fun but It wasn’t perfect to begin with. At first, it took sometime to understand each other..I was patient, he was too. Just like any relationship, but like I’ve preached a few times so far. Communication has been key. I've gotten to try a few things I've never done before. He actually asked me what I liked the very first time. Worked on it and got better. Bonus: I have gotten to teach him a thing or two and he’s also open to trying new things to please me. Not to knock on older men (or men around my age) more but I don't have to wait for him to get hard. Also don't have to feel like a chore to have sex just so my partner can get off, its been mutual and intimate for the most part.

He might be an anomaly but I really think I lucked out with someone who is more emotionally and mentally mature than most men in their 40s or 50s. Perhaps simply because they don’t have a lot of baggage from a previous marriage. Dating someone younger has just been easier.

Maybe the stars were aligning, meeting him few days after break up. Him kept showing up in my life, in the most random places and time. Most of all trusting my gut that he was a good person. I didn’t go looking for a younger partner. I went looking for peace, respect, and connection and somehow found all three in a place I never expected. The coincidences were signs of something larger at work, guiding my steps and the world giving me a hint. Follow, positive energy flows and it attracts people into your life you never think would have.

So for those who are older, don’t be so quick to turn them down.. a lot of the time it is just mental and our mind trained to tell us what we are supposed to do (. I encourage you to explore especially if come across someone you feel is genuine. What’s the worst that can happen?

As the title states, I am moving to American Fork from out of state at the beginning of March. I'm a 26 year old single conservative guy with a degree in Game Design, currently working IT for a financial company. This will be the first time I have ever moved, and I'm trying to prepare as best I can.

I enjoy going to concerts (the primary genre I listen to is metal, but I also enjoy punk and rock, my favorite band right now is Lorna Shore), playing Magic the Gathering (commander/EDH, I have 17 decks), and playing video games (I've been playing WoW since vanilla, regularly play R6, just started playing For Honor, and also enjoy games like Minecraft and Marvel Rivals). I also like tattoos, activities in nature (I am extremely excited to experience Utah camping), and am wanting to dip my toe in the hunting scene. I've hunted pheasant before but haven't done any big game. I'm also a big fan of firearms and archery, I have a compound bow I've taken to a local range a few times and have gone out shooting with a wide variety of different guns. I am also a big fan of food. Everything from a good burger to sushi and other ethnic cuisines, there isn't anything that I would say no to if it tastes good. Same goes with coffee, I am already stoked to have a Dutch Bros so close by! I am a big tequila guy as well and while I don't drink super frequently, maybe a few times a month if that, I enjoy experiencing the different flavor profiles the spirit has to offer.

Now that I am out of the way, I am curious what tips/advice/pointers you guys have for someone who is looking to experience nature and all that Utah has to offer.

I grew up on a small farm and came out at 19, so being a rural gay isn't entirely unfamiliar. But after decades of big city living, I have to say it's changed a lot, in many ways for the better, in others, not so much. 

For starters, the few neighbors I have have been welcoming and entirely unconcerned with my sexual orientation. Most have seemed far more curious about what kind of neighbor I generally am, namely whether I'm a flipper or an Airbnb-er. I'm neither. I've exchanged numbers with all the neighbors I've met and, being the road I'm on is incredibly remote, they all seem to keep an eye on one another's property. 

Being out for 30 years, having lived in numerous states and types of regions, I know very well what it feels like when someone is uncomfortable with gays, even when they don't say a word, and I haven't encountered that once. My mailman introduced himself. I've had several contractors over to do work on the house, a plow guy to plow the drive a few times, and all have been very chatty about where I'm from, curious about why I moved here, and ultimately friendly and eager to at least do business with me. 

I'm in a deep red county in upstate New York, but it doesn't seem to be particularly religious. Tattered MAGA flags are common but tattered Pride flags aren't uncommon. I get the impression it's a very live-and-let-live kind of place. The rural area I grew up in was far more religious. No one's tried to convert me.

That said, treading into rural life from the city in 2026 is a lot different than treading into urban life from the country in 1996. I didn't really have any expectations. I watched the world change from various cities over the last 30 years, so I didn't expect country life to remain unchanged. But I am curious where and how gay people meet one another. 

I assume it's mostly online. It became the same in the cities, but I never really got into the apps, and in the city, you didn't really need to. What seems to be gone in the country are the offline places gays once met. The coffee shops. The book stores. The underground gay places aren't as gay as they once were.

Note: I talk about Cymbalta, Ulcerative Colitis, Vitamin Deficiency, Liver Damage, and my general distrust of the medical community. Also, TW for suicide mention. 

So, I’m around 26 now. I’ve been taking Cymbalta for maybe 5 years? I don’t remember the exact timeline, but I’ve been on 60mg for a long time now. I’ve been on various antidepressants/anxiety meds since I was 16. 

I recently got diagnosed (finally) with ADHD and started taking Adderall, and I’m not sure if they are somehow reacting with each other, or if I just came to the realization way too late, but I believe the Cymbalta is causing me massive sleep problems. I thought it may have been the Adderall, but when I tried stopping it, nothing changed.

I was also diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in 2019 (mine is fairly manageable, thankfully) and need to take Mesalamine to control the inflammation in my body. I have flare ups every now and then, and during those times, I’ve felt that maybe the Cymbalta makes them worse. This hasn’t been confirmed though, as generally, anything I put in my body during a flare up makes it worse. Lol.

Two weeks ago I missed a dose of Cymbalta for the first time in a while. I was working on an art project and stayed up until 2am, and figured I would just take my meds in the morning. Well, as I was working, I got this sudden and horrible bought of stomach pain/nausea. I thought maybe I had food poisoning, but it also could have been my Ulcerative Colitis flaring up? Anyways, I ran to the bathroom and went to bed right after. 

When I woke up, I felt HORRIBLE. My head was pounding and I still felt nauseous. I took my Cymbalta (along with other meds) and hoped it would help. I do genuinely think I was sick and may have had the flu, but it was only after taking my meds that the pain in my head steadily increased along with my nausea, until I threw up. From there on, I was no longer nauseous, but my body HURT. I had a migraine for 4 days. It literally hurt to move. I was waking up freezing and would just sit in the shower until the water turned cold bc it was the only thing that helped.

(Note: this may have been drawn out, bc I was forced to go into work during those 4 days)

I still don’t know if the Cymbalta withdrawal had something to do with that, or if it was just genuine sickness. I tried stopping once cold turkey in the past, and it gave me crazy dizzy spells. Back then, when I tried getting back on, it made me throw up as well.

ANYWAYS, I decided to be responsible and actually talk to my doctor this time around. She said I could start weaning off, and originally said I could just cut my dose in half every other day, but after me saying I was afraid of side effects, she is now having me reduce 20 mg every other day. 

It’s been about 5 days now (so two decreased doses total) and my head is killing me. I swear at one point today I felt like there was a nerve in my brain pulsing with my heartbeat. My jaw/tmj/neck pain is insane. I slept way deeper than usual last night, but I felt like shit all day today and just layed in bed with a headache. 

Also, every time I eat, within like one hour I am blowing up the toilet. Like I have to run there multiple times. I had explosive diarrhea after my morning coffee yesterday, left the bathroom for 5 minutes, and had to rush back for round 2. Sorry for the TMI but…. I really can’t tell why this is happening bc I have so many health issues right now😭. Is it the Cymbalta withdrawal or my UC flaring up???? 

While I was at the doctor, I was also given a blood test. I have been having very serious problems with fatigue, and the Adderall is the only thing that makes me feel awake and functional. It showed my Vitamin D levels and Iron were both low, and I was instructed to start taking supplements. 

It also showed my AST and ALT are extremely high. These are both used to check for liver damage/disease. I was told it could be due to me being sick the week prior to the test. I was asked if I drink a lot (no, not really. maybe a few times a month) and if I take lots of Ibuprofen. (…no, especially now that my UC doctor said I should be mindful of it and take Tylenol instead, if needed) I did hesitantly tell my doctor that I “used to take it a lot back in highschool”. 

She didn’t really seem concerned, and said I’ll just have to check my labs next month to see if it was a fluke or not. 

Maybe I should’ve disclosed this, but it’s really uncomfortable to say to a complete stranger over the phone (OR in person). But when I was in highschool, I tried to kill myself by taking an entire bottle of Ibuprofen (along with some Adderall I think?)…I never went to the hospital afterwards, and no one in my family really knew. They thought I just got a stomach bug. After being violently ill/throwing up for like two days, I went back to pretending nothing happened. It was only years after that that I got diagnosed with UC and had all these health problems surface. I can’t help but worry my current problems are because of that incident.

On top of that, yesterday I JUST found out that Cymbalta can affect your liver?! 

Apparently, you’re supposed to be careful consuming alcohol while taking it. This is something no doctor has EVER mentioned to me. 

I can’t help but feel betrayed by the medical system at this point. Why did no one think to mention that? Is it because I say I don’t drink much? I mean, I do still drink sometimes, and I go out and get drunk at clubs in occasion. I’ve been drinking a little more lately because I never had a crazy “party phase” in college (too busy shitting blood from my UC so I basically was sober). I thought I could let loose a little now, but was I really just doing irritable damage to my body the whole time? 

So basically, I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this or has some advice? 

I want to stop taking Cymbalta because I already take a frankly copious amount of pills at this point, and have been hoping to go a more “holistic” route. I am now also worried about the effects it’s having on my organs. 

I don’t trust doctors. I’ve rarely had positive experiences with them. It feels like they just don’t really care. I’ve even cried in front of them once because they told me it “looked like I had been using Google MD a little too much”. Well… what else do you expect me to do when you don’t disclose basic information to me?! I’m paying hundreds of dollars for them to talk to me for 5 minutes, prescribe me pills, and tell me to come back in a year. 

Even for my Liver Issues, the doctor I was seeing told me to just “go into urgent care” to get my labs because my office “isn’t taking walk-ins”. I’m sorry, but how is it a walk-in if I don’t need to lab for another month?! How is scheduling something a month in advance considered a walk-in?!🫨😤😭🤨

😔…okay, to be fair, I understand this is due to staffing issues and overwork. I know it’s just the medical industry in America being absolutely horrible. It’s not really the employees fault. But damn, I just really feel like they don’t care at all. It really disheartening. It makes me afraid to go to the doctor. 

So that’s why I figured I would rant it all out into the internet. Maybe someone can learn something from this. If you relate and/or have any advice, please feel free to share. ",2,1768789382.0,cymbalta,0,1.0,False

He continued pushing and asking me on a date, and when I told him I have a boyfriend he said we can be friends, I said no, etc. and from then on he would continue asking me personal questions like my major in school, what I like to do, etc. When I stopped responding to any prying questions he started deliberately asking me about coffee because it’s my job to answer those. He even told me this whole story about how he used to own 5 coffee shops in his home country of Afghanistan, which I believe to be a lie because he’s also asked me “what machine is this” about a grinder, which he would know if he’d owned coffee shops. He’s also asked me before about my schedule, when we close and if I close alone, and I made sure to emphasize we NEVER close alone. I have since stopped engaging with him at all but he continues to stare at me while I’m working, and constantly calls me “pretty” instead of my name, which he knows, (“hi/bye pretty”). He also has been bringing in this young woman around my age and constantly staring at me and checking my reaction of seeing her, like he’s trying to make me jealous or something. 

I have told my manager all of this, given a written statement, and gotten all my coworkers to back me up and corroborate that they have witnessed this. She has done absolutely nothing. She even took his order today and neglected to say anything to him. I am at my wits end and feel uncomfortable and on edge at work because I expect him to come in at any time.

The piece follows a salaryman from Luzon who files for leave and travels south, choosing a temporary pause over resignation. Upon arriving in Siargao, the routine of city life gives way to a slower rhythm—flip-flops replace leather shoes, the heat of the sun sets the pace, and the island atmosphere takes over.

A 45-minute drive north from the airport leads to Tangbo Surf Spot, passing long stretches of greenery and quiet roads. The destination offers more than waves: vinyl records spin on a turntable, and a carefully brewed cup of coffee completes the experience.

According to the feature, the setting highlights a lifestyle that values balance—where work is not abandoned, but briefly set aside to make room for rest and reflection.

For digital nomads, **Bonifacio Global City (BGC)** and **Makati** are a *completely different experience*.

If you want **reliable infrastructure, strong internet, modern apartments, and a true big-city lifestyle** in Southeast Asia, these two districts are where Manila shines.



# 📍 Why BGC & Makati Are Nomad-Friendly

Unlike much of Metro Manila, **BGC and Makati were built (or rebuilt) with modern urban planning in mind**.

You get:

* Walkable streets (rare in the Philippines)
* Modern condos with gyms, pools, and security
* Reliable fiber internet
* Coworking spaces and business cafés everywhere
* International restaurants, malls, and services

These areas feel closer to **Singapore-lite** than “typical Manila.”



# 💻 Remote Work Setup (This Is the Big Advantage)

If work reliability is your top priority, Manila — specifically BGC & Makati — is one of the **best setups in the Philippines**.

# Internet & Workspaces

* Fiber internet widely available (often 200–500 Mbps)
* Coworking hubs like WeWork, KMC, and local spaces
* Cafés with strong Wi-Fi and laptop-friendly policies
* Power outages are rare compared to islands

👉 This is one of the safest places in the country for **video calls, meetings, and full-time remote work**.



# 💸 Cost of Living (Reality Check)

Manila isn’t the cheapest option in the Philippines — especially in BGC.

Approximate monthly costs:

* 🏠 Studio / 1BR condo: $700–1,200 (BGC higher than Makati)
* ☕ Coffee: $3–5
* 🍽 Local meals: $3–6
* 🍽 Western food: $8–15
* 🚕 Grab rides: cheap, but traffic adds time

It’s more expensive than Siargao or Cebu — but you’re paying for **convenience and stability**.

# 🏙️ BGC vs Makati (Quick Breakdown)

# BGC

* Clean, modern, walkable
* Newer buildings and infrastructure
* Feels international and polished
* Higher rents
* Fewer “local” vibes

# Makati

* More chaotic but more authentic
* Slightly cheaper rent
* Older buildings mixed with modern towers
* Great nightlife and food scene
* Very central location

👉 Many nomads start in **BGC** and later move to **Makati** once they know the city better.



# 🍜 Food, Social Life & Daily Living

Manila excels at **convenience**:

* Massive malls with everything you need
* International cuisine everywhere
* Grocery delivery, GrabFood, services on demand
* Active expat and nomad communities

Nightlife is strong, social life is easy, and English is spoken fluently almost everywhere.



# ⚠️ Honest Downsides

Manila isn’t paradise — here’s the real talk:

* Traffic can be brutal
* Pollution and noise outside premium districts
* Not much nature inside the city itself
* You’ll need patience during rush hours

Most nomads treat Manila as a **work base**, then escape to islands on weekends or monthly trips.



# 🏖️ Easy Weekend Escapes

From Manila, you can quickly reach:

* 🏝️ Batangas beaches
* 🏄 Siargao (flight)
* 🐠 Palawan
* 🌋 Tagaytay (cooler weather)
* 🏖️ La Union (surf town)

This makes Manila a great **hub city**, not just a place to stay.



# 🧭 Who Is Manila Best For?

✅ Manila (BGC/Makati) is great if you:

* Need reliable internet & infrastructure
* Work full-time or manage calls/teams
* Want modern living and services
* Enjoy urban lifestyle
* Plan frequent island getaways

❌ Not ideal if you:

* Want quiet, slow island life
* Hate traffic and dense cities
* Need daily access to nature



# 🌍 Final Thoughts

Manila isn’t the Philippines’ dream destination — **but it might be its most practical one**.

For digital nomads who prioritize **work stability, convenience, and global-city comfort**, **BGC and Makati** offer one of the strongest setups in Southeast Asia — especially if you balance city life with regular beach escapes.",1,1768788876.0,digitalnomadlife,0,1.0,False

Whole smoked duck was great, but would go just breasts next time if I can find a decent price.  The texture just complimented the rest of the dish perfectly

Failures:

The recipe called for grilled Asian mushrooms, so I thought I’d get creative and slow roast them under the duck with some leftover chicken stock to let all the duck fat drippings flavor them - big NOPE - the duck fat fried them - For 3 hours. Black, hardened, and completely inedible. Pivoted to grilled broccolini last minute that worked great.

Final word: amazing cook with little effort. 10/10 recommend. Don’t slow roast anything under a duck. Save the drippings for a fry at a later date . ",5,1768788869.0,KamadoJoe,0,0.78,False

Beijing, dusk, an alley.

A young girl stumbled forward, several house slaves chasing close behind her.

“Stinking lass, stop right there!”

The girl’s body felt weak, and a swollen red lump adorned her forehead. Her vision began to blur.

“Help! Somebody help me!”

One of the house slaves behind her heard her shouts, cursed angrily, and picked up a stone from the roadside, throwing it forcefully at her.

The stone cut through the air and struck the back of her head.

Bang.

Blood splattered.

A sharp pain surged through her, and the girl’s vision went black. Her body lurched forward, and with her last shred of consciousness, she tumbled and crawled out of the alley.

Just then, a carriage happened to pass the alley mouth.

As the girl tumbled out, she rolled directly in front of the carriage.

“Whinny—!”

The horses pulling the carriage were startled, letting out a neigh.

The sudden turn of events also caused the surrounding commoners to exclaim in alarm.

The house slaves rushed out, not seeing the situation clearly. When they saw the girl lying in front of the carriage, they immediately moved to grab her.

“Quick, get her back before anyone sees her face clearly!”

The girl was grabbed by the shoulder. In that moment between life and death, she erupted with her last burst of strength, violently breaking free. She turned and clambered onto the carriage, falling headfirst inside and bumping into someone’s chest.

The coachman whipped the house slaves, his pupils constricting. “Damn it, how did that girl manage to get into the carriage in that brief moment?”

Inside the carriage, a slender hand with distinct knuckles clamped onto the girl’s neck, pushing her away from his embrace.

The girl’s eyes were tightly shut, and she had no breath left.

“Hmm, dead?”

“Then just throw her out.”

Just as he was about to toss the corpse out of the carriage, the girl, whose neck was being choked, suddenly “swish” opened her eyes.

In an instant, her gaze was cold and sharp, carrying a frosty killing intent.

Lu Zhaoling, resurrected from the dead, opened her eyes to see a captivating face.

Ink-black hair adorned with a purple jade crown, complementing skin like snow. Her long eyebrows were lightly brushed with pale ink, and her eyes were like stars falling into the deep sea. Her nose was straight like a peak, and her lips were like the most beautiful petals, but a hint of coldness at their corners added a dangerous charm.

The next second, Lu Zhaoling swiftly struck out, aiming for his throat.

Her fingertips were like swords, so sharp they seemed poised to pierce directly into his windpipe. The stunning atmosphere instantly turned into surging killing intent.

The hand on her neck tightened, and at the same time, his other hand seized Lu Zhaoling’s wrist.

“A dead person can still be so aggressive?”

Lu Zhaoling’s head throbbed violently, feeling blood flowing from the back of her head. Listening to his deep voice, she looked up at his aura of purple energy and the black mist slowly devouring it.

Imperial Star fate.

So it was his Imperial Star purple energy that helped her resurrect, living again in this young girl’s body.

Feeling her neck being choked tighter and tighter, Lu Zhaoling pointed at his chest and squeezed out a difficult sentence.

“I can save you…”

The slender, well-defined hand paused slightly, then pulled her closer. They were so near that Lu Zhaoling smelled a faint, clean scent from him.

Their gazes clashed at close range, as if sparks were crackling.

“How will you save this king?”

Lu Zhaoling struggled for breath, “Let me stay by your side for half a year, and I’ll let you know how to save yourself!”

She needed time to recover, and she needed his purple energy.

“Master, are you alright?” Outside, the guards had already dismounted and surrounded the carriage tightly, their expressions tense.

The curtain blocked their view of the inside, but no sound was heard.

Even so, none of them dared to step forward and lift the curtain.

“It’s nothing.” A low voice came from inside the carriage.

Just then, a group of people arrived, aggressively blocking the carriage.

The newcomer wore a magnificent brocade robe, an jade-inlaid belt, and gold beast patterns embroidered on his attire. A green jade ring adorned his hand. His entire being loudly proclaimed “power.”

However, with his puffy eyes, thick lips, pale and slightly bloated face, and dark circles under his eyes, he looked like a useless glutton.

“It’s the Son of Marquis Qingfu!” A passerby recognized the man.

Zhu Minghao, the Son of Marquis Qingfu, was the most favored by the Empress Dowager and had always been arrogant and unrestrained in Beijing, with no one daring to provoke him.

The house slaves who had been chasing the girl quickly ran to Zhu Minghao and started complaining, speaking over each other.

“Young Master, that girl is in the carriage!”

“Young Master, this carriage looks unfamiliar. We were afraid of causing trouble, so we didn’t dare to snatch her.”

In truth, they were intimidated by the imposing aura of the other party’s guards.

Zhu Minghao scrutinized the carriage, then squinted at the four guards, letting out a disdainful snort.

“Who cares if it’s familiar or not! Pull that girl out for this young master!”

Everyone was about to move forward.

“How dare you!” A guard roared, “Prince of Jin has returned to Beijing, who dares to be presumptuous?!”

At these words, everyone around was stunned as if struck by lightning.

“Prince… Prince of Jin?!”

The Prince of Jin had left Beijing five years ago for recuperation, and there had been no news of him for a long time. Now, he had quietly returned to Beijing?

Inside the carriage, Lu Zhaoling leaned in a corner, watching the man meticulously wipe his hands with a handkerchief, his movements elegant.

His hand had just choked her neck; he found it dirty.

Lu Zhaoling’s vision periodically darkened; she hadn’t fully adapted yet. She knew she needed to leverage his power to overcome the current crisis.

She suppressed her nausea, “This deal is not a loss for you. After all, your life is very valuable. Without my help, you won’t live for many years.”

This was the second time she had said she could save him.

Zhou Shiyue, the Prince of Jin, glanced at her indifferently, “Why don’t you first tell me, where do I need saving?”

No sooner had he spoken than Lu Zhaoling suddenly lunged at him with extreme speed, grabbing his collar and tearing it.

Rip.

Zhou Shiyue’s collar was ripped open, revealing his collarbone and a section of his chest!

His pupils constricted, and he once again clamped her slender neck, “Do you want to die?”

On his pale chest, a strange black mark prominently appeared, like a monster hidden beneath the skin.

Lu Zhaoling’s finger poked it, and the black mark seemed to be alive, shrinking slightly, its color instantly fading a bit.

“Cough, cough, are you sure you don’t need me to save you?” Lu Zhaoling, though choked, looked at him with a calm and confident gaze.

Outside, Zhu Minghao’s shout was heard, “Prince of Jin! I am Zhu Minghao of Marquis Qingfu’s manor! That girl is my concubine, hand her over quickly!”

Zhu Minghao had initially been startled by the mention of the Prince of Jin, but he quickly recovered. Even the Prince of Jin couldn’t snatch his woman in the middle of the street!

If this reached the Empress Dowager, she would surely protect him. Everyone knew the Empress Dowager disliked the Prince of Jin, didn’t they?

“Are you, a dignified prince, going to pick up this young master’s concubine?”

Zhu Minghao shouted loudly, giving a look to his retainers. The retainers immediately rushed forward, blocking the four guards.

Zhu Minghao then swiftly ducked forward and yanked open the carriage curtain.

My partner can help but he has to get ready for work too! MIL won’t be here until 7 to take over. I’m hoping by then he can hang out better in his bouncer?

1qgr746,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qgr746/left_behind_parts_13/,Left Behind parts 1-3,"Entry 1. 

Let me start by saying that I have never been a very religious man. I was raised catholic but lost interest in organized religion when I was in my late teens. Since then, I've been... Agnostic/Christian adjacent. I like the idea of Christianity, and I do believe something more happens after death. But I also think that we as humans, aren't capable of comprehending what it is that comes after. I live my life around basic morals, not an organized doctrine. I always believed that was good enough, now I'm not so sure. 

I got to work this morning and had a cup of coffee while I went over the days schedule. I work in manufacturing. I use lots of heavy equipment, so my job gets pretty noisy.  As I drank my coffee and looked over my schedule, one of my coworkers came over. Complaining as usual about deadlines and not being paid enough. He was a bit younger than me and had an air of entitlement about him. It was part of his daily routine, and I was the unfortunate bastard who got to hear him vent. Normally I don't mind it too much, today however, I was just not in the mood. As he went on, I casually reached up and activated the noise cancelling function on my earbuds. He continued talking but now all I could hear was the music I had been listening to. I'm still fine by The Red Clay Strays. 

I am not a people person by any stretch of the word, my whole life I have been referred to as extremely introverted. I actually do like people for the most part, but sometimes I find just basic human interactions to be completely exhausting. My coworker silently droned on, and I just nodded and smiled. My input was not required; it almost never was. 

After about an hour into my shift, I felt the coffee doing its work on my insides, so I headed for the bathroom. On the way I passed by a few of my other coworkers huddled together watching something on a phone and murmuring to each other. Before entering the bathroom, I had to step aside to avoid the big forklift my boss was using to unload materials from a semi-trailer.  

As I sat on the porcelain throne, I pulled out my phone and began scrolling through Instagram reels. At first there was nothing out of the ordinary, prank videos, police body cam footage, funny cat videos and a few conspiracy posts. But then I noticed something, a series of reels showing the concerned faces of people talking about the coming rapture.  

“Thats weird.” I thought. That was the first I had heard of it and apparently it was supposed to happen today or tomorrow, at least according to some South African pastor. I shrugged and kept scrolling. There seemed to be a new doomsday prediction of some kind every year or so now. This one would be no different than the rest, lots of panic for nothing. 

After time thefting another five minutes or so, I decided it was time to get back to the grind. So, I finished up my paperwork and stood. But as I reached out and flushed the toilet with the toe of my boot there came an enormous trumpeting boom that echoed through the building. I flinched and slapped my hands to the sides of my head. The sound was so loud that my noise cancelling earbuds began to pop and wine with distortion. I crumpled to the floor under the immense weight of that sound and curled into a fetal ball. It probably only lasted ten seconds but it felt more like ten minutes. But then just as abruptly as it started the sound was gone.  

I climbed to my feet and listened through my ringing ears before I cautiously approached the door. Where I live and work is right in the middle of tornado alley. There had been nothing on the news about bad weather but still, my first thought was that a tornado had blown through and wiped out the shop. Only the sun was shining when I had gone to the bathroom. The weather can change pretty quick in around here, but I hadn't been in there that long.  

I gently pushed open the door and saw nothing out of place. At least not at first. The machines in the shop were still humming, the lights still on and outside the garage door the sun was still shining. So, what the hell was that sound? I opened my mouth to ask as much, which is when I noticed. There was no one in the shop.  

I searched the different departments in the shop, I searched the breakroom, the office, the other bathrooms. But there was no one there. 

“Hello?!” I called out to the empty shop. “This isn't very funny!”  

 I stepped outside to see all the vehicles still in the parking lot. That was weird but what really began to unnerve me was the forklift my boss had been driving. It was an older forklift and without riding the brake it would just keep driving forward. It had made its way across the parking lot, slowly pushing its way through the chain-link fence. With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone and called my girlfriend, but she didn't pick up. I hurriedly made my way to my truck and started home, calling her over and over.  

On the road I saw a few cars that looked like they had just aimlessly drifted off of the road. I considered stopping to see if anyone needed help but there seemed to be no one around them. Jen still wouldn't answer so I began calling my parents, then her parents, then friends. I called everyone in my contact list, and no one answered.  

The streets of my small town were empty, apart from a few stalled cars and one small bicycle lying in the center of the road. I pulled into my driveway and ran inside the small house my girlfriend and I rented. 

“Jen! Jen! Where are you?” I shouted as I ran through the house searching every room for her. She wasn't there. “Fuck!”  

In a panic I ran from house to house banging on doors, but no one answered. I could feel tears running down my face as I inevitably began kicking in the doors of my neighbor's houses, desperately searching for someone for anyone. I spent hours doing that. Hours breaking into houses and screaming, begging for someone to be there. I drove to my parents' house, to Jens parents, to my grandparents. They were all gone. Everyone. 

Eventually I wound up back at home. Sitting on my porch, I felt so lost, so alone and so very scared. What was happening? I had a thought that maybe it was just my town. That maybe something had happened, a storm warning or a chemical spill or something like that. And they all needed to be evacuated. That had to be it. I jumped into my truck and drove dangerously fast to the next town over. Then to the next town, then the next. There was no one. No people. I saw dogs, cats, birds, cattle, hell I even saw a few deer. But no people. 

I don't know how long I drove, how long I searched, hours and hours. But I was completely and utterly alone. It happened, didn't it? The Rapture? I can't find any new social media posts, though the internet is still working, at least for now. I turned on the tv but there were no live channels. What happened? Was I missed? Was I forgotten? Or am I just not worthy? And what do I do now? I... I think I'm going to find a bottle of something really strong, and I'm going to drink it until I don't care anymore.    

 

Entry 2. 

So, it's been a few days now and I've noticed some strange things. I mean apart from the actual fucking rapture happening, leaving me (as far as I can tell) the last man on earth. Well, the last sane man on earth. I think I'm sane anyway... 

Admittedly I did spend the first, let's say roughly 36 hours, in a drunken haze. I remember going through cycles of crying myself to sleep and laughing at my predicament until I passed out. Needless to say, I was not in the best state of mind. But then, what would you do in my place? Think you could handle it any better? 

Actually, the only reason I eventually sobered up was that I ran out of alcohol. I woke up late Thursday morning with a pounding head and a swirling gut. I stumbled my way to the bathroom of the small house I had been renting with my girlfriend. She was gone now, just like everyone else.  

As I leaned over the toilet, voiding out my insides, I felt the reality of my situation creeping back in. Not long after, the shakes started up. I flushed and hurried to the fridge; I needed a drink before I broke down again.  

I flung open the fridge door and felt my stomach drop. There was nothing left, no beer, no wine, nothing. I screamed in frustration as I slammed the door closed. “God Dammit!” 

I tried to compose myself; I really did. Instead, I broke down again.  

When I was done with my momentary pity party, I grudgingly decided it was time for a supply run. We needed groceries badly before... all of this, and along with the drinking I had done quite a bit of emotional eating as well. Half a bag of stale Fritos, the rest of mine and Jens leftovers from the pizza place, and several bowls of cereal with questionable milk. So, I threw on my bathrobe, climbed into my truck and headed to the store.  

My local grocery store would have beer and frozen food. But if I went ahead and drove 15 minutes to the next town over, they had an actual liquor department in their grocery store. That seemed well worth the drive to me.  

On the way, I cycled through radio stations, hoping and praying to hear a voice, even if it was just some prerecorded message. But there was nothing on, nothing but dead air. I couldn't stand the silence, so I reached under my seat. After a bit of fumbling I found my CD case and slid in one of the discs. It was an old mix I had made in high school. Metallica, Radiohead, Black Sabbath, and Nirvana. I swerved and weaved between stalled cars on the highway as Creep blared through my truck speakers, loud enough to wake the dead. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking. 

About 10 minutes later, I pulled into the parking lot of the big grocery store. Not worrying about the shopping cart crunching under my wheels, I backed right up the door of the store and stepped out onto the empty lot. I noticed a small dog a few yards away, sniffing at a dropped purse. It was a corgi, and it wore a leash the same shade of pink as the purse.  

I started to walk on into the store but hesitated. If the dog ran off with the leash still on it could get tangled up or trapped. Maybe if it was friendly I’d keep it. After all, I was alone now, and dogs are supposed to be man's best friend, right? 

I stepped over to the dog, which eyed me curiously. “It's okay girl, I'm gonna take care of you now.”  

But as I got closer, the dog lunged back, snarling and barking. “What the hell?” I thought. I had never had a dog respond to me like that, I love dogs, and they usually love me. Maybe she was just freaked out from what was happening, I knew I was. 

“Easy girl, I'm not gonna hurt you.” I said softly as I crouched down, trying to seem unthreatening.  

The dog barked and snarled as it backed further away. But it couldn't go anywhere very fast. The leash was actually fixed to the heavy purse.  

As quick as I could I reached down and grabbed the purse, pulling the dog towards me and into my arms. It snarled and snapped trying to bite at my face, but I managed to get the collar unfastened. I dropped the dog and stepped back, watching as it took off running and yipping in fear.  

“Poor thing” I thought. “It must be terrified.” I watched it continue running as fast as its little legs could carry it, until it disappeared around a corner. With that over, I turned and headed inside the store. 

I was glad the power was still on as I made my way down the aisles, I hadn't even thought about bringing a flashlight. That thought led me to wondering, how long would the power stay on? With no one to maintenance the grid, it would only last a couple days, right? Maybe a week tops. I decided that however long it was on I was going to enjoy drinking my beer cold while I could.  

I was halfway through a six pack when I made it to the exit, my cart filled with booze, hot pockets, and various other unhealthy items. I even had a carton of cigarettes, I don't even smoke, but I figured now was probably one of the best times to start. 

I was in the middle of wondering if and where I could find some drugs, (I had never done any drugs before, aside from a little pot when I was younger) when my eyes caught something across the street. It was the mall, the same mall where I had met Jen. “Jen...” I felt a hitch in my chest as the pain started up again. I bit down on it and downed another beer. I looked at the mall again, shaking thoughts of her from my mind. The food court had the best soft pretzels in the state. I sniffed and pulled a bottle of Kentucky bourbon from my cart and headed across the street. 

Walking through an empty mall in the middle of the day is... unsettling. After raiding the food court for the now very hard pretzels, I stumbled aimlessly from store to store. I rode the escalators up and down over and over again. There was evidence that people were here. I saw plates of food unfinished on the food court tables, bags of purchased items littered all around the floor, and a few abandoned strollers. What happened? I mean really, What the actual fuck happened to everyone? And why hadn't it happened to me?  

I looked up at the roof skylights. “WHY!?” I shouted. “WHAT DID I DO?” I screamed to a God who had clearly abandoned me. I was answered only by my own voice, echoing through the empty mall.  

About half of the bottle was gone when I stumbled into the movie theater. I found myself wishing I knew how to run a projector, there were a few movies on here I wanted to see. But at the time I was too far gone to even attempt figuring it out. Instead, I filled a bucket of popcorn and made my way into one of the auditoriums. I plopped down into what I thought was the best seat in the house, absolute center of the theater. I stared up at the blank silver screen, thinking back to all the movies I had seen here, with my dad, with my friends, with Jen. Tears burned in my eyes as I ate my stale popcorn and drank my bourbon. 

 

Sometime later I woke up and didn't immediately know where I was. The dim theater lighting seemed strange and alien. I climbed to my feet and let the empty bottle I was holding clatter to the floor. Suddenly I remembered, it all came back in a flash. I was alone and just like that, I felt the shakes coming on again. 

I left the mall and made my way back to the grocery store. The frozen food I had collected was now a soggy mess. I wondered how long I was gone. Checking the clock on my truck dash I realized it was quite a while. It was 9:26AM. I had left my house around noon, yesterday. I shook my head and started to chastise myself for my degenerate behavior, then shrugged it off. Who the fuck would care now anyway, there was no one left to judge me. After another round of grocery shopping, (more booze and hot pockets) I climbed back into my truck and headed for home. 

When by some miracle I made it back home in one piece and unloaded my supplies, I remembered something. The dog from the grocery store and the way it had been stuck on the leash. I knew that some of my neighbors had dogs and cats, and I still kind of wanted a pet. At least then I wouldn't be completely alone. 

I made my way around the neighborhood, checking the houses for trapped pets. Some were already gone from when I had broken in before. But the others... They reacted to me exactly like the dog from the store. Mrs. Smith's chihuahua was terrified of me. The Ryan’s golden retriever snarled at me like it wanted to bite my head off. I couldn't understand it. Those dogs had always been so friendly. I had brought Churro home to Mrs. Smith after he ran off dozens of times. And the Ryans always walked Goldie around without a leash. Their behavior, even under the circumstances, just made no sense. Unless... The lyrics to the song I had been listening to on the way to the store came back into my mind. “What the hell am I doing here?... I don't belong here... I don't belong here.”  

They knew. The animals, they knew. Something is wrong with me. I don't belong here, not anymore. I finished making my way around the neighborhood, propping doors open. The animals could come and go as they pleased. I wouldn't bother them. 

Finally, I made it back to my house and stepped inside. With nothing else to do, I threw a hot pocket into the microwave and started in on the next case of beer. 

I hadn't realized that I left my front door wide open, not until I heard the noise of something scuffling slowly across the floor. I felt a momentary spark of excitement, thinking that just maybe one of the dogs had calmed down and sought me out. I stepped around the corner to the front door and froze. The blood in my veins turned to ice water. It was a man, he was bald, broad shouldered and wearing a dirty, rumpled grey suit. And he was standing on all fours, staring up at me like a deer in the headlights. I wanted to speak, to ask him who he was or where he came from or what happened to everyone else or any of the dozens of other questions I’d had since this started. But I couldn't find my voice, and even if I could, I didn't want to. In that moment I was more afraid of him than I was of being alone.  

We stood there staring at each other, neither of us daring to move. Then the microwave dinged, and the man went into a panicked frenzy. He screamed in a deep throaty howl as his face contorted in anger. I began to back away but then he lunged at me, his fingers hooked and his teeth chattering. I screamed and fell back hard onto my ass. I scrabbled back out of his reach as he pounced at me again and again. But I couldn't get away. He grabbed me slammed me back against the oven causing a cast iron skillet that I had used and never washed to fall to the floor. I reached for the skillet with my right arm as I used my left to keep his gnashing teeth away from my throat. As I felt my fingers fumbling the handle of the skillet into my hand, my left arm erupted into a white-hot pain as he bit down on my forearm, shaking his head side to side like an animal. I swung the skillet with all of my strength, bashing in one side of his forehead. Blood spattered across the floor as he let go of me and whirled away trying to find his balance.  

I quickly stood and brandished the skillet in front of me like it was Excalibur. “Come on motherfucker! You want some more!” I shouted. Hoping I sounded more confident than I felt. In truth, I was petrified, I felt like I was about to pass out. Luckily for me, he didn't want any more and quickly ran out the door, still on all fours. 

I ran over and slammed and locked the door, gasping for air. I watched him through the window as he made his way to the woods behind my house. The whole way, he kept on shooting angry and confused looks back at me.  

 

Later, as I sat on my bathroom floor, I examined the bite he had taken out of my arm. The teeth went deep, and the bleeding hadn't yet stopped. There was about a quarter size chunk of my arm meat missing, I felt sick thinking about where it was now. I had a brief moment of concern about turning into whatever he was but dismissed it. That shit only happens with zombies, right? He didn't seem like a zombie, didn't really seem all that human anymore either. I thought about that as I disinfected and wrapped my arm with gauze and tape. There was something in his eyes, something primal, something feral. That's when it hit me, there was no humanity behind his eyes, no soul. They held intelligence sure but more like a savage and cunning intelligence. Like a predator. He looked at me exactly like the animals did, with fear and confusion.  

I didn't drink any more that night. I went to my closet and pulled out my grandfather's hunting rifle, a lever action 30-30. If he came back, I’d be ready.  I'm not as alone here as I thought. And I don't belong here. 



Entry 3. 

What do you do when the power goes out? Do you light candles? Get out your flashlights and dig into the ice cream before it starts to melt?  

What about when you're the last person on earth? When you know for an absolute fact that no one is coming to turn the lights back on. What would you do then? 

 

It had been a little over a full day since my encounter with the thing that looked like a man. My arm still seeped blood from the bite wound when I stretched but it showed no signs of infection. “Small victories” I thought. I had majorly slowed down on drinking for the time being, only needing a small drink from time to time just to keep the shakes away. I told myself I would have no more blacked out nights, at least not with that thing creeping about. 

It was around 7:30 in the evening and I had just thrown a pizza in the oven. I flopped down on the couch just as Indy was preparing to use the staff of Ra to reveal the location of the ark. I had eased some of my crippling depression by diving back into some of my favorite movies. 

Thunder rumbled loudly as the dark clouds that had been forming in the east rolled in. I had the thought as the storm approached, with no more news channels covering the weather, how will I know if I need to head for the cellar? (Not that I had a cellar. We always used our neighbors.) I mean, I live in central Oklahoma, we have pretty severe tornadoes all the time. 

My eyes caught a flash of movement from between the partially open curtains. I snatched up the remote and turned off the tv before grabbing my rifle and jumping to my feet. I crouched low and made my way to the front room window, my heart pounding like a drum. I carefully pulled open the curtain and scanned the surrounding area. Aside from a stiff breeze blowing the branches of the solitary oak on my front lawn, there was no movement. I pushed the curtain back into place and went to check the back window. Still, I saw nothing. Maybe the solitude and the paranoia were getting to me. I sighed, “Jumping at shadows” I told myself. 

I flinched back as a lightning flash lit up the sky, nearly as bright as full daylight, and the house shook under the force of the thunderclap. In the same moment all of the lights in the house went out.  

“Well, fuck.” I breathed. I know I should have been prepared for this; it was going to happen eventually. But as usual, I found myself up shit creek without a paddle. I glanced at the freezer; all of my perishable food would be thawing soon. Then to the oven, the electric oven. I was not only without a paddle, my damn boat was sinking too. 

As I sat there in the dim candlelight, eating my half-frozen pizza, I debated what I should do now. I could survive if I had enough nonperishable foods. I knew there would be plenty at the stores, not like there was a high demand right now. I had some candles and could get more but it was already early fall, I wasn't sure how I would stay warm through the winter.  

I had just decided that I would head to the hardware store in the morning and grab a couple generators and electric heaters, when my eyes happened to catch something at the back window. There were two, dim, shining lights at the window. I stated at them for a moment chewing my cold food, they looked like... “Shit!” I leapt up and grabbed my rifle. They were eyes, reflecting the candlelight. Something was peeking in my window. 

As I got to my feet the eyes darted back into the darkness. But I wasn't going to let it get away. I grabbed my flashlight and a roll of duct tape. As quickly as I could I wrapped the tape around and around, fixing the flashlight to the rifle barrel.  

Flicking off the safety, I carefully pulled open the back door and shined my light out into the yard. I couldn't see anything, I couldn't hear anything. So, I cautiously stepped out through the back door, scanning side to side, my finger on the trigger. Thunder boomed overhead as the first raindrops started to fall. As I searched for the big man, (I was sure it was him) I noticed something odd, there was a coppery smell in the air, and it seemed to be growing stronger. That was when I saw it. Scattered among the clear raindrops, there was something else. I held out my hand and watched in fear and confusion as several of the drops that filled my palm were thick and dark red. “Blood.” I thought, “It's raining blood.”  

My eyes shot up as I heard a stick snap just ahead of me. I raised my rifle, shining the light through the growing curtain of red rain. My light couldn't reach the tree line from my back porch, but what I saw froze me in my tracks. There were eyes, more than a dozen sets, shining from within the woods. My heart was pounding as I began to slowly back towards the door.  

Suddenly there was a scuffling sound from behind me, I whipped around to see an old woman in a nightgown crawling down my roof towards me. My knees felt weak at the sight of the hatred on her blood coated face but there was no time to hesitate. I raised the rifle and fired just as she leapt at me from the roof top. The round ripped through her chest but didn't slow her descent. She plowed into me, knocking me to the ground. As I struggled to get her off of me I could her a rush of movement from the things in the trees. With a rush of adrenaline, I threw the old woman's limp body off and dashed through the door, slamming it closed behind me.  

I slid the deadbolt into place just as the feral people began pounding against the door, I braced my shoulder against it and screamed in fear and anger. They howled and grunted but somehow the door held and they eventually lost interest. 

 I stepped over to the window and peaked out. There were fourteen of them. Apart from walking around on all fours and the animal look in their eyes, they were just people, men and women. From elderly to young adult, I didn't see any children though, I was grateful for that. I don't think I could have shot a kid, even if it was one of those things.  

As I watched, the feral people began to gather around the old woman I had shot. I felt a pang of guilt when I saw her try to get up and fall, she was still alive. As she squirmed in pain, the others reached out for her. I imagined they would band together and carry her away, maybe try to nurse her back to health. But that wasn't what happened. I watched in horror as they all pounced on the wounded woman and began to eat her while she was still alive. I slumped to the floor and held my rifle tight to my chest as the old woman wailed and screamed. 

 After an agonizingly long time, the wailing stopped. Replaced by the sound of wet chewing and the snap of bones. Thunder boomed overhead again, it was almost loud enough to drown out the sounds of the horrific feast taking place just outside my door... almost. Eventually, shock and exhaustion caught up with me, and I fell asleep, slumped against the door.  

 A while later, I shot awake at the sound of breaking glass. I looked around the room but saw nothing. I was in the darkened back bedroom, still leaned against the back door. Candlelight flickered in the front room, casting moving shadows throughout the house. I held my breath and listened. For a moment there was silence, the feast had ended, and the rain had softened to a drizzle. Then I heard it, the sound of hushed movement. Soft steps on hardwood floor accompanied by the pitter patter of water or blood dripping onto the floor. 

I carefully got to my feet and crept to the bedroom doorway, looking out into the house. It was him, the big man in the gray suit. He was drenched in blood, and his forehead was split and bruised from where I had hit him with the cast iron skillet. He was staring at the candle and hadn't noticed me yet. My heart pounded as I raised the rifle and placed the sights right between his eyes. I pulled the trigger... but nothing happened. I glanced down at the gun feeling betrayed by it. Only to realize that in my panic I had forgotten to work the lever, ejecting the spent casing and chambering a fresh round.  

When I looked back up at the feral man, a jolt of fear shot through me. He was gone. Had he heard the misfire? Had he seen me? My heart jackhammered in my chest as I crept back into the room. I wanted to work the lever, to chamber a round but what if he hadn't heard me, he would certainly hear that. Fear paralyzed me with indecision. Then I heard more movement, there was another one inside. As quietly as I could I got down in the floor and crawled under the bed. I could hear them coming closer, sniffing and grunting to each other. I tried to control my breathing as one of them stepped through the bedroom doorway. I watched as the man thing crawled around sniffing the floor where I had been.   

I held my rifle, as it sniffed its way towards the bed, praying I was quick enough to chamber a round and fire before it found me. All at once there came a crash from the front room.  the feral stopped its tracking of me and made its way back to where the commotion was.  

I let out a small sigh of relief and peaked out from under the bed as the candlelight seemed to grow brighter. The two ferals began grunting and huffing, as if in a panic. Then I heard the sound of more glass breaking and grunts and huffs were gone. I crawled out from under the bed and looked in horror at the front room. Flames crawled up the side of the couch and across the floor as my shag rug went up like a bonfire. 

“No! No! No!” I breathed as I ran into the room and began stomping at the flames. But it was no good. The fire was already getting out of control. I turned as I heard a snarl. The big feral was just outside the broken front window. I chambered a round and fired but the bastard was already moving, leaping through the window at me. I stepped back and worked the lever again, but he wouldn't hold still long enough for me to get a shot. I moved to keep the rug fire between us. We circled for a moment but then he leapt across the flames at me. I ducked to the side as he skidded across the hardwood floor and into the back bedroom. I jumped up and pulled the bedroom door shut, trapping him inside, at least for the moment.  

I looked back at my house the flames had begun to catch on the walls, there was no way I'd be able to put it out, not now. I had to get out of there. I grabbed my keys off the hook and ran out the door as I left my house to burn. Luckily there were no more ferals nearby, though I could hear them coming. I leapt into my truck and floored it through the neighborhood. I watched in the rearview as the home Jen and I had lived in together went up in a blaze. My only consolation was that maybe the big feral would burn up with it. 

 

I had to pull over when I was only few miles out of town. My hands were shaking so bad I couldn't keep the wheel straight and I was beginning to hyperventilate. It was gone; everything was gone. My home, my food, water, clothes, spare ammo for the rifle. I had lost everything. I know it can all be replaced, now more easily than ever. But it wasn't about that. With everyone I knew now gone, with all that I had lost, those little things in our house had reminded me of all of the best times in my life. All of our photo albums, Jens clothes, all of the little everyday things that you never even consider until they are gone. They were all just ash on the wind. 

God, I needed a drink. I glanced over at the rifle on the seat next to me, “or maybe just a shot.” I tried to laugh through the tears at my own grim joke, but I just couldn't find any humor in it. I glanced at the rifle again, it's dark promise of release hung heave in the air, as heavy as the coppery stench from the rain. What was I fighting for anyway? Why go on living like this? What was the point? I either live a long, lonely life and die alone of either sickness, exposure or starvation. Or maybe I would be ripped to shreds and eaten by those things. I had three rounds left. Either nowhere near enough, or two more than I needed... Bad thoughts to be having, alone in the dark.  

After a long while, I stepped out of the truck. Grasping the rifle with trembling hands. I knelt down on the dark blood coated pavement and placed the rifle barrel under my chin. I took great care to position it correctly; I didn't want to screw this up. I reached down, flicking off the safety and placing my finger across the trigger.  

One little squeeze, that's all it would take. A micro flex of my finger and all of my worries would be gone. I could do it... I could do it...  

I gritted my teeth and... Why couldn't I do it? It would be so easy, but I just couldn't. I slumped back against the side of my truck, the gun clattering to the ground. I sat there, breathing hard, sobbing for... I'm not sure how long.  

I had chosen life, whatever that meant now. So, with great reluctance, I climbed to my feet, picked up my rifle and climbed into my truck. I removed my phone from my pocket and looked at the screen saver, at her smiling face. For some reason, in that dark moment, I smiled back. With my choice made, for now at least, I set off to find my new home.

Me (33m) and my now-ex husband (40m) have been together for 9 years. I proposed on our one-year anniversary and I have truly never been happier.

Our relationship has weathered its struggles. We've always supported each other through various periods of unemployment, picked each other up after family traumas, took care of each other during a pandemic, and have generally been there for one another through thick and thin. 

At the turn of 2020, he landed a role that was extremely demanding of his time. Even through the pandemic, it would take him overseas every other week. I would go to bed with him next to me, on his laptop. I'd wake up at 6 AM to make coffee and find him in his emails at the kitchen counter. 

I've always known him to be driven and put everything he had into things he cared about. But the fly-in, fly-out lifestyle, his need to take anxiety meds to manage work and the subsequent lack of intimacy, was too much for me. I felt like I had a roommate I happened to be married to.

I communicated in numerous, often fiery, arguments that things had to change or I would leave him. He needed to be more present, we needed to have more intimacy, I needed to feel more like we were a partnership. Sometimes he agreed, but more often than not, he would dismiss my feelings.

We tried to compromise. He went so far as to give me, a monogamous gay man, freedom to seek out intimacy with other guys. This wasn't really ideal for me because I am, again, a deeply monogamous person and I wanted that to be an experience just between us. This reached rock-bottom when about 6 months ago, my ex and I took a short weekend trip interstate and I found myself not wanting to be touched by him. 

Last year, I met someone (27m) who quickly grew to be more than a friend with benefits. We camped together (my first time), played videogames together, went exploring around my city. I was fascinated by this guy, and our friendship deepened.

And friendship turned into affection. Affection eventually became deep, unrelenting love.

I had fallen head over heels with a guy that my ex-husband had introduced me to. This new guy is neurodivergent himself, takes great pains to understand who I am and is an ear my ex-husband never was.

At no point in any of this was my ex unaware of things between me and this new guy... he encouraged the connection, and told me ""if he makes you so happy, I really think you should go for it.""

I was deeply confused. I was hurt at my ex husband's apparent refusal to make things work between us, about his openness to my relationship with the new guy, about his own admitted hurt at what was blossoming into a full blown romance without him.

Fast forward some months, I'm now living with new guy. My ex-husband has been extremely, impossibly gracious about all of this and he's helped with the financial considerations of moving. We parted on the best possible terms; I do still truly love him but my romantic attraction to him is long gone.

But I feel like I'm exploring this new, wonderful relationship that has been so good for me while also grieving something I never thought I'd give up.

What I'm here to ask is, how do I talk to my ex husband when I want to vomit on him all the good he's done for me and how sorry I am that things have turned out the way they have? I don't want to give him the impression we're getting back together (we're not, and he knows it), but he is such a wonderful person and I feel like I'm going crazy with guilt. It is literally breathtaking at times, this realization that my life won't be the same, that I've hurt him so incredibly deeply.

Is this a time thing? When does it get easier? Does it make sense for me to reach out to him and show him gratitude and remorse for everything that's happened between us?",1,1768787808.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I completely went cold turkey on all things bad. No more sodas sugary or no sugar. No more fast food. Anything bad i cut out. Working out 3 days a week. Drinking only water and black coffee. Eating only healthy foods, veggies, brown rice alternatives etc. When I came in on the 8th of December I was 280 lbs. I weighed my self a month later on the 8th of January and i was 260. I weighed myself once again today the 18th and i weigh 250. Should I be concerned in any way? Or would this just be because of me going cold turkey and completely reversing the way I used to eat. I also don’t feel like crap. I feel pretty good actually. I used to be a slop eating nothing but unhealthy food almost everyday. Drinking zero sugar sodas and fast food. But i just want to see if anyone has any input on something like this. ",6,1768787802.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,4,1.0,False

Usually, I like to go out in the morning for my cup of coffee down the street. Mind you I’m in college, and in between jobs doing freelancing, so moneys very tight for me. But I still offer coffee for the front guard every so often when I feel generous/ or I wanna share the extra $20 I have. But recently I noticed, every time either I don’t offer him coffee or buy it for him, he just isn’t friendly and kinda scowls at me. I mean, I would totally offer him coffee all the time if I could but I just can’t. And I know yeah, coffee is a waste of money, but it’s the only thing I spend money on and I consider self care, it’s a reason for me to get up in the morning. But yeah, I mean, all this kinda has turned me off from the idea of offering to buy and pay for his coffee anymore, because it makes me feel really bad when I can’t afford it.

1) I'm too lazy to google. WTH Is the point of the coffee trees? I see you can scrap them for 1 bio matter but given that it take 150 to create the soil to grow them in,  that seems pretty useless.

2) I want to know if this is just a ""me"" thing. When swimming down to the underwater seed vaults, my latency SKYROCKETS. Like 200+ms, stuttering . Its only when I get to the bottom of the vault to swim up and while inside. As soon as im out and about 1/2 way up the height of the vault, it subsides.

3) does anyone else get the shader issues in Lazarus when its raining outside? Like, you know its raining because of the little dark splotches that appear when moving?

4) also with Lazurus, ive noticed little ""whisps of smoke"" just hanging around in the main chamber. 

I'm on a 2060ti and playing on ""dogwater"" graphics settings so those last two could be due to that. Just curious. 

Last one, what are y'all doing to keep making food. My last two launches, I wen with the ""spendy"" humans (director, teacher, guardian etc) so I went through a ton of human food. (Seriously, their lifespan are like 160 years). Now I've got to replace all of that food and bim out of biolight, biodark, bio waste and the blue stuff. I've been cruising all of the POI's for any mobs that I missed but they are few and far between.

I'm short because I used all of the bio-matter for diesel for a long time. Don't judge me. Lol

I have really been struggling as a catechumen for multiple reasons. I do love vespers and liturgy, belief in the Eucharist and intercession of Mary and the saints. I have been attending for many months now and while I have missed my fair share of sundays, I’ve also gone quite a few times and to coffee hour and most of the people seem insular overall. I am a woman without children and my husband is not interested in orthodoxy. I’ve never pushed it on him or anyone. I have noticed how few women I see on saturdays and most of the women my age haven’t smiled or welcomed me really in any way. Which brings me to this…I realize this can be an issue anywhere but how much did a lack of community and support affect you in this faith? I feel like I don’t have any real connection with anyone there. I did invite a lady over to my home and we had a nice time but then it‘s just seemed as if she’s been cool to me maybe because i haven’t become a member? another woman I initially connected with has a lot of mental health problems and is a very difficult, negative person, so I tried to gracefully end connection with them. I have met one kind lady who we meet up every so often. the Orthodox Church does seem to attract strange personalities in my experience so far.  it seems like it’s all young men which is fine it it is very lonely. I don’t understand their hang up on imagination with the rosary. I’m also wondering how many people really follow and believe that you can’t pray with the heterodox? Are there really strange sex rules in orthodoxy? and fasting is definitely not something I’m excited about to be honest. I haven’t heard any strange rules in catechism class but have heard from a couple of people in the parish that Protestants are hell bound. I find it confusing because it seems like you get different answers from different people. I haven’t become a member of the church because I’ve been trying to take things slowly and carefully. I haven’t had anyone reach out to invite me anything Bible study related or just anything for that matter. is there a level of gatekeeping involved to protect themselves from associating with unofficial orthodox?

I built Caffeine Curfew because I’m a caffeine addicted software engineering student that needed to get a grip on their caffeine habits and sleep schedule. 

In 10 days I’ve gotten over 1000 downloads and 400 dollars in revenue, and lots of feedback. Fortunately, mostly positive! 

The app is built native for the watch & completely in SwiftUI for the interface and SwiftData for the app storage. 

The biggest engineering challenge I faced was getting the three way handshake between the watch, Home Screen widgets, and the main app to work perfectly. 

The app integrates with Apple Health, and is super easy and straightforward to use. If anyone needs a help getting their caffeine intake in order, hopefully you can find the app of use!

Any and all feedback is taken very seriously!

We're all chronically online, overstimulated, and have zero clue how to connect without it feeling forced or cringeworthy. Scrolled through endless relationship advice, dove into psychology research, listened to Esther Perel's podcast religiously, and read actual studies on attachment theory. What I found completely changed how I see romance.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: romance isn't about grand gestures or expensive dates. It's about intentional attention in a world designed to distract you. We're all so dopamine-fried that genuine presence feels revolutionary. The dating industrial complex wants you to think you need perfect date ideas and flawless execution. Bullshit. What people actually crave is feeling SEEN.



*The art of paying attention* is where real romance lives. Not checking your phone during dinner. Remembering the small stuff they mentioned three weeks ago. Noticing when their mood shifts. Sounds obvious, but when's the last time someone gave you their full attention for an hour straight? Probably never. We're all half present, half scrolling, always waiting for something better. Break that pattern, and you'll stand out like crazy.

Dr Sue Johnson (she literally wrote the book on emotionally focused therapy and has 30+ years researching couples) talks about this in ""[Hold Me Tight](https://a.co/d/izdj4OV)"". She breaks down how emotional responsiveness creates secure bonds. The book won awards for basically proving that vulnerability and attentiveness matter more than compatibility. Read it, and you'll understand why your ex relationships failed. Seriously, this book will make you question everything you thought you knew about love. Best relationship psychology I've ever encountered. It's not some fluffy self-help garbage; it's clinical research made digestible.



*Ask better questions.* Stop with the ""how was your day"" bullshit. Try ""what made you feel most alive today?"" or ""what's something you've been thinking about lately that you haven't told anyone?"" Genuine curiosity is disgustingly romantic. Most people ask questions just to fill the silence. Ask because you actually want to know their inner world.



*Create tiny rituals together.* Could be making coffee a certain way every Sunday. Could be a specific song you play on car rides. Could be a dumb inside joke nobody else gets. These microscopic traditions build your own private universe. Couples who last have their own language, their own ecosystem.

[The Paired](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paired-couples-relationship/id1469609343) app is actually clutch here for building that connection. It's like Duolingo but for relationships, sends you and your partner daily questions that get progressively deeper. You'd be surprised what you DON'T know about someone you've dated for months. Helps you move past surface level conversation into actual intimacy territory without it feeling like therapy homework.

There's also this AI-powered learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been useful for understanding relationship dynamics better. It pulls from relationship research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content based on what you're struggling with. You can tell it your specific situation, like ""I want to be more emotionally available but not needy"" or ""help me understand attachment styles in my relationship,"" and it generates a custom learning plan. The depth is adjustable, too, so you can get a quick 15-minute overview or a deep 40-minute dive with real examples. Makes absorbing this psychology stuff way easier when you're commuting or at the gym.



*Anticipate needs before they ask.* This is next level. Notice they always get cold at restaurants? Bring a jacket without being asked. Do they stress about work presentations? Text them encouragement that morning. See, they're exhausted? Run them a bath. Small acts of service that show you're paying attention to their patterns. That's the language of devotion.

Alain de Botton's work on this is unmatched. ""[The Course of Love](https://a.co/d/bkQHFYJ)"" explores how relationships actually function past the honeymoon phase. He's a philosopher who founded The School of Life, and this book reads like watching your future relationship play out with all its beautiful messiness. Insanely good read that shows romance isn't about constant passion, it's about choosing someone even when it's boring or hard. Most romantic books are fantasy; this one is REAL.



*Be present during sex but also outside of it.* Physical intimacy matters obviously, but romance is sustained through nonsexual touch. Holding hands while walking. Playing with their hair while watching TV. Random hugs from behind while they're cooking. Skin to skin contact releases oxytocin, which literally bonds you together. We're just mammals who need touch. 



*Write things down.* Doesn't have to be poetry or love letters. Just observations. ""You looked happy today when you were talking about your friend's wedding."" ""I love how passionate you get about random documentaries."" Keeps you noticing the details that make them THEM. 

The Gottman Institute's research (they've studied thousands of couples over 40+ years) shows that successful relationships have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. Basically, you need five good moments to balance one shitty moment. So romance isn't perfection; it's consistently showing up with small kindnesses that outnumber the inevitable conflicts. They have a card deck app that's weirdly helpful for sparking actual conversations instead of just existing next to each other in silence. 



*Be emotionally available but not needy.* Share your feelings without making them your therapist. Ask for support without demanding they fix you. Secure attachment looks like ""I'm struggling with something, can we talk?"" not ""you're making me feel this way."" Understanding this distinction is massive.

Here's what's wild: once you start practicing this stuff, it stops feeling like effort. Becomes automatic. Your brain literally rewires to notice opportunities for connection. Neuroplasticity works for love, too. You're training yourself to be someone who SEES people fully, and that skill transfers everywhere.

The real enemy of romance is autopilot. We get comfortable and stop trying. Stop noticing. Stop being curious. Relationships die from boredom and neglect way more than dramatic betrayals. So the ultimate romantic move is refusing to let your attention drift. Staying fascinated by this person you chose. That's the actual work, and nobody warns you about it because it's not Instagram worthy.

But when you get it right? When someone feels truly cherished and known by you? That's the stuff that lasts past the butterflies and initial chemistry. That's the foundation for building something real in a world full of shallow connections and infinite options. Romance isn't dead; we just forgot it requires intention.

1qgqvtq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgqvtq,January Backpacking Debrief,"I posted a proposed itinerary about a month ago.  Y'all offered some great advice.  I wanted to provide a little debrief on the trip.  

**Day 1 - Midland to Chisos Basin Campground:** 

This was about a 4 hour trip.  Midland Airport is pretty small--rental car acquisition was quick and easy.  Odessa has a Bass Pro Shops where we bought fuel for the stove and bear spray. 4 hour drive to Chisos Basin Campground.  We stopped for food and water in Ft. Stockton.  Last real town before the park.  Arrived after dark.  Approximately 30\* and windy. Night was 30\* and breezy. 



**Day 2 - 1/2 Backpacking:**

Moved our vehicle to parking lot just outside Visitor's Center. Started hike from Chisos Basin Campground to South Rim Site #3 via Pinnacles-Boot Canyon-Colima-South Rim.  We planned to hit Emory Peak along the way but bailed to ensure we made it to camp before dark.  We had a late start (11AM) and arrived at camp around 4PM.  Our route was just over 7 miles.  Had we departed around 9AM like we planned I think we would have had time to hit the peak and make camp before dark.  Our team implemented a 5 min. on, 1 min. rest on the hike up Pinnacles.  Faster hikers would have made up a lot of time in the first few miles.  Camped at South Rim #3.  This was a suggestion from one of you all.  I originally had South Rim #2 booked but changed to South Rim #3.  Much more private and much better views.  I highly recommend this spot. Night was 30\* and rainy.  Tent was frozen in ice in the morning. 

  
**Day 3 - 2/2 Backpacking:**

Returned to Chisos Basin Campground via Laguna Meadows.  All downhill and a pretty easy hike (obviously would be more difficult in the opposite direction). Weather was rainy but trail conditions held up very well--thanks to everyone who maintains the trails out there.  Made it the vehicle around lunch time. About 5.5 miles total.  Lodge restaurant was closed because of water issue but ate a food truck parked nearby.  Drove around 1 hour to accommodations in Terilingua.  Stopped at Cottonwood General Store to get groceries (53710 TX-118, Terlingua, TX 79852) and Shot Time Liquors (101 Medic Ln, Terlingua, TX 79852) to get food for the rest of the trip.  They had everything we needed.  Stayed at The Summit at Big Bend (https://summitbigbend.com) just west of Terlingua. Highly recommend the Casa Grande.

  
**Day 4 - Terlingua Accommodations:** 

Did a short day hike/exploring of some of the trails around our accommodations.  Easy day.  Did the walking tour of Ghost Town in Terilingua.  Ate dinner at High Sierra Bar and Grill.  Give the chili dogs a try.  

  
**Day 5 - Travel Day:**

Drove Terilingua to Midland.  Just shy of 4 hours.  Took a different route than Day 1.  Passed through Alpine, TX. Go to Vise Coffee.  Made it to airport, returned rental car, checked bags - no issues.  

  
**Weather:** Colder than I expected.  30\*-45\*.  Warmed up to 60\* on our last day.  

**Wildlife:** We saw some wildlife including whitetail deer, Mexican Jay, Javelina

**Safety:** Felt safe the whole time.  Did carry bear spray.  Border Patrol checkpoints headed north out of Terlingua.  Cashier in Ft. Stockton reminded us to ""not trust anyone"".  The road from Ft. Stockton to Big Bend NP is very remote but we didn't have any issues.  Be prepared for no cell phone service and few other vehicles.  Fuel up in Ft. Stockton.   

**Water:** There was no water on our backpacking route.  Our team of 3 carried approximately 6.5 liters each (1 3L hydration reservoir, (2) 1 L bottles and (1) 1 L bottle each.  We each finished with about 1.5 L remaining.  We would have gone through a lot more if the weather was hot.  We didn't sweat too much. 

  
Not much I would change about this trip. Prompt departure at 9AM would have given us an opportunity to do Emory Peak.  It would have been a long day but doable.  We also didn't get to see into the South Rim.  Planned to do this on day 2 but it was so foggy we wouldn't have seen much anyway.   

  
Thanks to all the locals that hosted us, the NPS employees maintaining everything and you all who offered advice.

We just got a Breville Bambino and very quickly realized our current coffee bean grinder does not grind fine enough at all.

We get a coffee subscription through Counter Culture so we have many varieties of roasts. I would love a grinder that can make great espresso from a variety of beans but can also be used for the occasional pour over. 

Ive seen a lot about the DF54, Baratza esp Pro, etc. Even took a look at the Varia vs3 2nd gen.

Ive seen the prices on grinders go up to crazy money but im just looking for something that will meet my needs. 

My budget is pretty flexible but im not looking to spend over 400...

I just want something that will work and be reliable for a decent amount of time. Please help me out! ",1,1768787055.0,espresso,8,1.0,False
