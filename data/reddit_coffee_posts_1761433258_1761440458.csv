1og7n7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1og7n7d/breville_bambino_basket_replacement_budget_200/,Breville Bambino basket replacement [budget $200],"Looking for advice on the following
1. Basket, portafilter upgrades
2. Milk frother attachments.

I recently got a good deal on an ex-display Breville Bambino (not the plus just the base model). It was $180 which was great because I was looking at the delonghi stilosa and this was only $30 more. But it‚Äôs missing a couple of baskets, in particular, the bigger single walled basket. It has the small 1 shot basket but not the 2 shot one. Do I need it? There are 2 of us here, and sometimes I have 4-6 people over. Are the 2 shots the same quality as the 1 shot? I havent made espresso in years, but have watched a lot of youtube videos.i was already preparing to upgrade some of the stilosa baskets.

What other accessories should I pick up, I am on a budget but willing to buy the essentials. I am in Australia and everything is very expensive here lately(the Bambino plus is $500 and the dual boiler is $1300 which are out of my range). I already have the breville smart grinder. I know its not the best but anything I make will be miles ahead of the McDonalds drive though coffee I get. I drink cappuchinos with alternative milks (oat, almond etc).

1og7jtl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1og7jtl,"On this day in Tay-LORE history, Taylor Swift released her third studio album, ‚ÄúSpeak Now,‚Äù on October 25, 2010.","On October 25, 2010, Taylor Swift released ‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù as her third studio album with Big Machine Records.¬†

Taylor framed ‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù as a loose concept album about the unsaid things she wanted to deliver to the various subjects of the album‚Äôs songs. Taylor wrote all of the songs on the album herself without co-writers. Speaking on a live webcast on July 20, 2010, she said, ""I actually wrote all the songs myself for this record. It didn't really happen on purpose, it just sort of happened. Like, I'd get my best ideas at 3:00 am in Arkansas, and I didn't have a co-writer around and I would just finish it.""¬†

According to Big Machine Records president/CEO Scott Borchetta, the album's original title was *Enchanted*. He explained: ""We were at lunch, and she had played me a bunch of the new songs. I looked at her and I'm like, 'Taylor, this record isn't about fairy tales and high school anymore. That's not where you're at. I don't think the record should be called *Enchanted.*"" After the discussion, Taylor then excused herself from the table. By the time she came back, she had the ‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù title, which comes closer to representing the evolution that the album represents in her career and in her still-young understanding of the world. The title represents a common theme throughout the album, which is speaking up about things that Swift wished she had said in the moment, but didn't.

Using confessional songwriting, the album is mostly about heartbreak and reflections on broken relationships, and some tracks were inspired by Taylor‚Äôs rising stardom in the public eye to address her critics and adversaries. Taylor and long-time collaborator Nathan Chapman produced ‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù together, and the album combines country pop, pop rock, and power pop. Its songs incorporate prominent rock stylings, and their melodies are characterized by acoustic instruments intertwined with chiming electric guitars, dynamic drums, and orchestral strings.

The standard edition of the album is comprised of fourteen songs with a run time of sixty-seven minutes and twenty-eight seconds.

**Singles and Music Videos**

‚ÄúSpeak Now‚Äù had six singles that were released throughout 2010 and 2011:

* ‚ÄúMine‚Äù
* ‚ÄúBack to December‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMean‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe Story of Us‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSparks Fly‚Äù
* ‚ÄúOurs‚Äù

[Taylor directed the music video for ""Mine""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPBwXKgDTdE) with Roman White, who had directed some of her previous music videos, including those for ""You Belong with Me"" and ""Fifteen.‚Äù ‚ÄúMine‚Äù marked the first time Taylor served as director for one of her music videos. Taylor explained that the uptempo country-pop song is about her tendency to run from love. Swift chose her friend Jaclyn Jarrett, the daughter of the professional wrestler Jeff Jarrett, to play the younger version of herself in the video. The music video was shot in Kennebunkport, Maine. The video begins with Swift entering a coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that a couple, opposite where she is sitting, is arguing, reminding her about her parents arguing when she was very young. A waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by to take Swift's order. She looks up and infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, Swift's lover proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did when she was younger as she saw her parents arguing. He follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees.¬†

[The music video for ""Back to December""](https://youtu.be/QUwxKWT6m7U?si=BD-G6KAJYG16wGl_) was directed by Yoann Lemoine, and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed the idea for the video after being inspired from the 1982 film *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*. Taylor‚Äôs love interest in the video was played by the model Guntars Asmanis. The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on Country Music Television and Great American Country. It begins with a young man seen walking alone in a small town to the snowy football field in a winter morning. The video cuts to Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her house. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through the video, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers of the snowy football field, reading her apology letter.

[The music video for ‚ÄúMean‚Äù](https://youtu.be/jYa1eI1hpDE?si=HMnt4GHBBELwKcbB) was directed by Declan Whitebloom, who wrote its treatment with Swift. It was filmed within two days at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Taylor wanted to convey the experience of being bullied by showcasing the stories of others rather than her own narrative, allowing a broader audience to connect with its message. The music video, which stars Joey King and Presley Cash, premiered on Country Music Television on May 6, 2011. The music video begins with Taylor playing a banjo in a theater alongside her band, all dressed in vintage-style outfits. The video then shows a young male who is being bullied by football team members for reading a fashion magazine. Swift is seen donning a white 1920s-inspired dress, tied to railroad tracks by an antagonist who mocks her with his friends. A young female (played by Cash), earning money for college by wearing a costume to promote a fast food restaurant, is shown being bullied by her peers who throw food at her. Another girl (played by King) cannot join a group of girls during lunch because she is wearing a different colored ribbon around her waist and is forced to eat in the school bathroom. The theater stage transforms into a luxurious nightclub, with Swift wearing a sparkling flapper dress and performing with her band. The video then reveals that the male who was reading a fashion magazine is now a renowned fashion designer, the restaurant employee has become an executive, and the female with the unique-colored ribbon is the only audience member in the theater, watching and applauding as Swift finishes her performance.

[The music video for ‚ÄúThe Story of Us‚Äù](https://youtu.be/nN6VR92V70M?si=nvDiVPKsYYdEt1ct) was directed by Noble Jones and was filmed at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. It on May 24, 2011. In the video, Taylor and her ex-boyfriend, both college students, try to avoid each other when they are in the same library together. Taylor is seen performing while standing in a library, sitting on a desk, and lying across a table with a stack of books next to her. Throughout the video, scenes of her and her ex-boyfriend are juxtaposed with those of the band playing. Swift chooses a seat in the library, but after finding her ex sitting across the table from her, she hides behind a book then looks away, pulling on her clothes and playing with her hair in an attempt to go unnoticed. Unbeknownst to her, he has noticed her and attempts to avoid her as well. The video ends with the students in the library dancing to the song, as Swift and her ex-boyfriend arrive face to face with each other, but eventually they both shrug and walk away.

[The music video for ‚ÄúSparks Fly,‚Äù](https://youtu.be/oKar-tF__ac?si=MOciW7YYnYjeOl0T) directed by Christian Lamb, was released on August 10, 2011. Taylor explained that the song is about ""falling for someone who you maybe shouldn't fall for, but you can't stop yourself because there's such a connection and chemistry."" The video features footage from Taylor‚Äôs Speak Now World Tour much of the footage was captured at four tour date locations, including one from the show in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the video, Swift is seen performing with many stage actors, dancers, and acrobats, through multiple costume changes, and slow motion is used extensively.¬†

[The music video for ""Ours""](https://youtu.be/LZ34LlaIk88?si=9odhxxKx5coBpzjy) premiered on E! on December 2, 2011. The video was directed by Declan Whitebloom, who had directed the video for Speak Now's third single ""Mean."" Taylor conceptualized the video's narrative herself. In the video, Swift plays an office worker, donning tennis shoes and messy hair. She engages in mundane daily corporate experience such as riding the bus to work, waiting to drink at the water cooler, and enduring annoying co-workers. As the video approaches the end, Swift's character is excited to leave work and meet her boyfriend (portrayed by Zach Gilford).¬†

**Speak Now World Tour**

To promote the album, a tour entitled the Speak Now World Tour was announced on November 23, 2010, by *Billboard*. The tour began with a six-day leg in Asia, from February 9 to 21, 2011. It then ventured into Europe during March, before Taylor began the North American leg on May 21, 2011. The North American leg ended in New York City on November 22, 2011, with a total of 80 shows. The tour extended into 2012 in Oceania. She visited 76 cities in 17 countries, selling out in every one.¬†

The Speak Now World Tour followed Taylor‚Äôs successful Fearless Tour which played for over 100 dates in over five countries. The tour marked the singer's first tour to perform in stadiums.

**Easter Eggs**

* ""Mine"": Toby.
* ""Sparks Fly"": Portland, Oregon.

Anyone else wake up feeling like a rusty robot some days? ü§ñ Yeah, me too. Especially after hitting the big 5-0! I swear, some mornings I feel like I need a crane just to get out of bed.

For a while there, I just accepted it as ""getting old."" But then I realized, wait a minute‚Ä¶ is this really how I want to spend my golden years? Creaking and groaning every time I move? Nope!

So, I decided to try something. And honestly, I'm kicking myself for not starting sooner. I started doing gentle morning stretches. I know, I know, it sounds boring. But trust me, it's been a game-changer.

What kind of stretches, you ask? Nothing crazy, just some simple stuff:

*   **Neck rolls:** Seriously, those little neck cricks can ruin your day!
*   **Shoulder circles:** Feels SO good after sleeping weird.
*   **Arm stretches:** Reaching for the sky (or at least the ceiling!).
*   **Back twists:** Gentle ones! No need to become a pretzel.
*   **Leg swings:** Helps get the blood flowing.
*   **Toe touches (modified!):** If you can't touch your toes, don't stress. Just reach as far as you comfortably can.

The key is *gentle*. Don't push yourself too hard, especially when you're just starting out. Think of it as lubricating your joints, not competing in the Olympics. üòú

The difference it's made is incredible. I'm more flexible, I have less pain, and I just feel‚Ä¶better. More *alive*. It's like someone oiled up my rusty robot joints!

I found that doing it right when I wake up before even coffee, gives me more benefits. I heard that some people have extra health boost doing it with a friend so I decided to share with you. We believe in strongest people. Here is a program where you can find friends and get the right support: [https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb).

Seriously, if you‚Äôre feeling stiff and achy, give it a shot. What have you got to lose? A few minutes in the morning? You might just gain back a whole lot of mobility and energy.

Do you think maybe there are other habits of yours that you should rethink and upgrade to prepare for this new chapter of your life? And is mobility even that important when we are so near the 'end' of our days? I would love to hear your thoughts on it.

1og7g9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1og7g9l/afterlight_horror/,AfterLight [Horror],"Hi everybody.

Ive been working on this book for awhile now, and would like to get some feedback from some Beta Readers. This is my final draft, as the book has seen 2 very severe rewrites, and multiple smaller rewrites as i can never be happy with it and changing one chapter requires changing multiple as i keep track of timelines and continuity. Formatting is finished and correct on the document, it just pastes weird on reddit and im using my phone instead of desktop so please forgive the formatting and lack of breaks.

Anyway, please let me know what you think.

PROLOGUE ‚Äî Daniels
March 11, 2025 ‚Äî 2:15 A.M. | Hawthorne, Los Angeles | Warehouse District

The trucks cut their engines and the world went small. No sirens. No lights. Just the tick of
cooling metal and the hush of twenty men checking their gear in the dim light of the armored
van.
Daniels was still the new guy on the team, still proving he belonged here. He pulled his gas mask
tight, feeling the straps settle against his head. His hands shook inside the gloves, and his heart
hadn‚Äôt slowed since they got the call. The air inside tasted stale and metallic. Rubber smell. His
own breath was the loudest thing in his head. He flexed his hands, made fists, let them go.
‚ÄúCheck seals,‚Äù Sergeant Cole said, referring to their gas masks. A ten-year veteran and the team
leader tonight, his voice carried the calm weight of someone who‚Äôd done this too many times to
count. Calm, steady. ‚ÄúQuiet entry. No bangs unless called.‚Äù
‚ÄúCopy,‚Äù someone said. ‚ÄúCopy,‚Äù another voice. The van went quiet for a moment while gear
shifted and safeties clicked. Then one of the older guys broke the silence: ‚ÄúNothing good
happens after midnight.‚Äù Another replied, ‚ÄúExcept overtime.‚Äù It helped. Just enough.
Daniels let his head rest against the van‚Äôs vibrating wall, the hum of the idling engine carrying up
through his helmet. For a moment, his mind slipped to his kitchen a few hours earlier that night.
Ellie, seven years old, had been on the couch in pajama shorts, hair a mess. Claire stood behind
her, patient, tired, smiling because she knew he needed it.
‚ÄúDo you have to go tonight?‚Äù Ellie had asked.
‚ÄúJust for a while. Keep Mom company,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, brushing her hair aside. He kissed her
forehead and left before she could cry. He told himself the lie was a small one.
‚ÄúDoor,‚Äù Cole said, and the memory snapped shut.
The rear doors opened. Night air slid in, warm and stale. The second truck opened the same way.
Twenty operators dropped to the pavement, rifles caged, lights off. No outer cordon. No marked
cars. Last-minute callout, high-risk, possible biological or chemical threat. They were it.
‚ÄúFour elements of five,‚Äù Cole said, hand signals following the words. ‚ÄúAll enter warehouse side.
Stay on comms.‚Äù
They moved. Boots barely whispered. The building sat at the end of the short street like a big
metal box. Corrugated skin. No windows down low. A roll-up door with a small access door
beside it. The single streetlight threw a weak wedge across the wall and left everything else to
the dark.
Cole took point on the access door. Quick pry. The latch gave with a soft click. The door opened
a hand‚Äôs width, then more.
‚ÄúStack,‚Äù he said.
Daniels slid into third. His heart beat in his throat. He kept his muzzle low, light still off. The
others pressed in behind. Two more stacks formed on either side, ready to flow after the first.
‚ÄúGo,‚Äù Cole said.
They entered.
Dark swallowed them whole. No overheads. Only the smell of dust, oil, and old equipment. The
click of rifle lights switching on‚Äîwhite cones that cut through the black like knives showing
metal shelving, wrapped pallets and aisles running like alleys.
‚ÄúElement One entering,‚Äù Cole said.
‚ÄúLeft clear,‚Äù Cole said.
‚ÄúRight clear,‚Äù Daniels breathed.
‚ÄúElement Two entering,‚Äù came a voice over comms. Then, ‚ÄúElement Three moving up behind
you.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúElement Four on your six.‚Äù
The four squads of five spread out, all through the warehouse side. The beams played over
corners. The air felt heavy and still. Their steps echoed off sheet metal and came back late.
‚ÄúKeep it tight,‚Äù Cole said. ‚ÄúOffice hallway on the south wall. We‚Äôll sweep it, link back to main.‚Äù
‚ÄúCopy,‚Äù Daniels said, and the word fogged his lens for a second.
They found the hall‚Äîa narrow run of small rooms caged in glass and drywall. Shipping,
accounting, a break room with a clogged sink and a pinned calendar. The coffee rings were old,
the surfaces wiped too clean, like someone had erased the day and left the walls waiting. The air
held that faint sour smell of stale coffee and dust, the kind that settles when a place hasn‚Äôt seen
real work in weeks.
‚ÄúWhole place feels wrong,‚Äù someone muttered.
‚ÄúEyes up,‚Äù Cole answered. ‚ÄúDaniels, take the far doorway, then cut back.‚Äù
‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù
Daniels stepped past a door and into a stretch of hallway that turned twice and kept going. The
rooms here were bigger, not offices anymore‚Äîstorage cages, copy rooms, a bathroom with a
mirror that showed a narrow man in armor he didn‚Äôt recognize as himself. His light touched a
mop bucket. Nothing moved.
He took one more turn. Then another. The sound of the team behind him thinned, became soft,
became memory. He realized he hadn‚Äôt heard Cole call a check in thirty seconds, then forty, then
a minute.
He keyed his mic. ‚ÄúDaniels checking in.‚Äù
Static. Then the hiss of his own breath. He tried again. ‚ÄúDaniels to Cole.‚Äù
More static.
He turned around, retracing his steps with growing urgency. The halls all looked the same‚Äîtight
corners and repeating doorways‚Äîeach turn only deepening the sense that he was spinning in
circles, not finding his way out. He took a left. He was sure he‚Äôd come from a right. He checked
his path on the floor‚Äîno footprints in the dust, no scuff marks, nothing to read. The light painted
white arcs on white walls. Every corner looked the same.
His chest felt tight. He told himself it was the mask. He moved faster.
‚ÄúCole, this is Daniels,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm one hall south of you. Say again your position.‚Äù
His radio crackled and then caught a voice‚Äînot Cole. Someone from another element,
breathless: ‚Äú‚Äîcopy warehouse floor‚Äîmove, move‚Äî‚Äù A burst of gunfire snapped in his ear,
distant and flat, followed by a shout and the clatter of metal.
Another voice. ‚ÄúContact! Contact!‚Äù
Then everyone spoke at once. Calls for positions. A scream he couldn‚Äôt place. Someone yelling
for a medic even though there wasn‚Äôt one. The sound slid from his ear into the walls and back
down the hall ahead of him, delayed by space.
Daniels stopped and set his shoulder on the wall. The paint was cold. He put a hand on his chest,
felt the plate, counted four slow breaths, then five. It helped for two seconds.
He started moving again. The hall opened into a cross corridor. When he stepped into it, his light
picked up a smear on the floor. Not much. A few drops pulled into a finger‚Äôs line. Fresh enough
to look wet.
He followed it.
His radio went to static, then found a channel. ‚Äú‚Äîall units, fall‚Äî‚Äù The voice cut off like
someone had taken the mic away.
Another voice, high and thin, different element: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre behind‚Äî they‚Äôre behind us‚Äî‚Äù
Then the awful sound of someone trying not to scream. The line carried it like a wire carries
heat.
Daniels didn‚Äôt know he had started running until his shoulder hit a doorframe. He steadied
himself, turned another corner, and stepped back into the warehouse proper.
The light from his rifle threw a tunnel across the floor. Two aisles of shelving to his left, three to
his right. The nearest aisle carried a trail‚Äîmore drops, then a hand smear, then a shoe print half
filled and skewed sideways.
He keyed his mic. ‚ÄúCole, do you copy? Cole, respond.‚Äù
Nothing.
He moved down the aisle. He kept his light low to catch the floor and the spaces under the
shelving where someone might be hiding. He wanted to keep it up. He wanted to see faces. He
couldn‚Äôt do both.
A sound came from ahead and to the right. Soft. Not a voice. Not a machine. Something like
cloth dragging and a boot toe tapping once and stopping.
‚ÄúPolice!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShow me your hands!‚Äù
No answer.
He took two more steps, and something stood at the edge of his light‚Äîa shape more shadow than
person. It was just a hint of movement, no features, no face‚Äîonly darkness shifting at the
farthest reach of the beam.
‚ÄúPolice!‚Äù he said again. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move!‚Äù
The shape didn‚Äôt move. It didn‚Äôt raise a gun. It didn‚Äôt do anything.
Daniels‚Äô hands shook. He told them to stop and they didn‚Äôt. He felt the fine tremor in the trigger
and hated it.
‚ÄúSay something,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSay anything.‚Äù
The shape leaned a fraction, or maybe he did. The light washed and flared. Reflex, fear, the noise
in his head‚Äîsomething made the decision for him. He fired twice.
The shape folded straight down, like the strings had been cut.
The echoes climbed the racks and fell back in pieces.
Daniels moved in. His light hovered. He forced it down and let it find what it would find.
The word was the brightest thing in the world: POLICE.
His stomach went cold. The light shook so hard the beam skittered over the letters. He stepped
closer and found the name tape. He didn‚Äôt read it. He wouldn‚Äôt.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. It sounded tiny in the mask. He said it again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù
He kneeled without meaning to. His breath fogged his lens. He pulled the mask down off his
mouth to get air. Stupid. He knew it even as he did it. He couldn‚Äôt stop.
Air hit his teeth like ice. He swallowed, gagged, swallowed again. Sweat ran down his temple,
into his eye, stung. He left the helmet on and the mask hanging and tried to breathe without
sounding like he was drowning.
‚ÄúCole,‚Äù he said into the radio, voice naked. ‚ÄúI need a medic and a supervisor. I discharged my‚Äî‚Äù
His voice broke. He cleared it. ‚ÄúI shot an officer by mistake. I shot‚Äî I need help.‚Äù
Static. No reply.
The silence that followed felt like weight. The gunfire on the channel had ended. The shouting
had ended. Everything had ended.
He left the mask hanging loose around his neck, hands shaking. He told himself to move and his
legs answered a second late. He checked the corners by habit. He checked under the shelving like
there might be an answer there. He stood and keyed the mic again.
‚ÄúThis is Officer Daniels. Anyone copy.‚Äù
Nothing.
He spoke into his own mic again, trying one more time. It hissed‚Äîand then he heard himself,
small and close, coming out of the dead man‚Äôs radio: This is Officer Daniels. Anyone copy.
He let go like it had burned him.
The building breathed around him. Not wind. Not machines. Just a pressure change, as if the
space had shifted an inch and settled back.
Something moved at the end of the aisle.
He brought the light up. The beam found three figures just inside its reach. They stood close
together, half hidden by the edge of a rack. Clothes torn, bodies wet with the kind of wet that
wasn‚Äôt sweat. Skin gray where it should be warm. Mouths dark. One of them made a sound like a
cough without air in it.
‚ÄúPolice,‚Äù Daniels said, though it sounded foolish now. ‚ÄúStay back.‚Äù
They didn‚Äôt answer. Their chests rose and fell, too fast. One of them dragged a leg and left a
smear. Another‚Äôs jaw worked as if chewing something that wasn‚Äôt there.
He stepped back. ‚ÄúStay where you are!‚Äù
He tried to put steel in it. He found none. His light shook in his hands, and the shadows seemed
to shake with it. They looked like people seen through bad glass, slammed too many times into
metal and concrete and the hard parts of other people.
He tried to think of procedure. He tried to remember a single line from the manual that would tell
him what this was. Nothing came.
‚ÄúBack up,‚Äù he told himself. ‚ÄúBack up.‚Äù
He did. Two steps. Three. He kept the light on them and felt the aisle narrow behind him.
Something cold touched his neck.
Hands like steel clamped the back of his vest and the side of his face. Teeth found the soft place
under his ear and closed there with a pressure that was almost gentle before it wasn‚Äôt. A white
light popped behind his eyes. His legs forgot how to be legs. He went down and his rifle went
with him, skittering away under a shelf.
He clawed at the thing on his back with both hands. He felt cloth, then skin, then the hard ridge
of a wrist bone. He twisted, striking backward with one hand and catching it enough to make it
shift. It let go to grab a better hold. He rolled, swung, hit something soft. The mask cracked
against the floor and rang like a bell.
He tried to crawl. His knees dragged. His boots didn‚Äôt answer. He told his legs to move and they
told him the message was lost.
The three in front reached him. One dropped on his thighs with a wet thump and started to pull.
Another went for his other leg and found meat. The third leaned over his chest and stared into his
face like a curious dog, head tilted, mouth hanging, breath sweet with rot.
He got his hand to his holster. He ripped the pistol out and fired up into the first one‚Äôs neck from
a foot away. The shot kicked the head back and put a hole where the throat should have kept air.
It didn‚Äôt change the work the hands were doing on his legs.
He fired again and again. Each shot cracked the air and punched heat into his palms, the recoil
biting harder each time. The muzzle flash lit the blood mist and the stink of burned powder filled
the air, until the slide locked open‚Äîsignifying he was out of ammo‚Äîand the ringing in the metal
stacked up with the ringing in his skull.
Feeling came back to his legs and he wished it hadn‚Äôt. Pain lit everything below his hips in red.
He felt the pull of his own muscles under someone else‚Äôs fingers. He felt teeth. He felt heat and
wet and then a cold that licked up after it.
He made a sound. He didn‚Äôt know it belonged to him.
He thought of Ellie at the kitchen table with the goldfish she‚Äôd won at the school fair and how
she had explained the trick to winning the game like she‚Äôd invented it‚Äîhow you didn‚Äôt aim at
the bowl you wanted, you aimed at the one next to it and trusted the bounce. He thought of
Claire‚Äôs hand on his shoulder the morning they signed the lease, the gentle squeeze that had
silenced his doubts better than any words could.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said again, but he didn‚Äôt know who he meant it for.
The dark pressed in from all sides, heavy and full of motion just beyond sight. The scattered
rifles still glowed weakly where they‚Äôd fallen, beams flickering across the floor in thin, broken
lines. He watched the light fade a little more each second and let the darkness take the rest.
The hands did not stop.
The darkness settled into silence where Daniels had fallen, the last echo of his shots fading into
the rafters. Out of that stillness came a new sound‚Äîsoft, a little tune without words, hummed on
a child‚Äôs breath. It drifted down the aisle and found its way between racks and rafters and the
places where blood had pooled.
The things in the dark paused. Not because they were done. Because something in the sound
made them lean their heads a fraction, like they were listening for a name.
Footsteps. Bare. Light. Careful.
At the far end of the aisle, the door eased wider. Pale night outside. A small figure in the gap.
A pink nightgown, hem dark with dirt. A stuffed animal held at the belly. Eyes black like
polished stone that reflected nothing but their own dark. She hummed and walked out into the
night as if she were leaving a movie early, bored.
Behind her, more shapes peeled away from the rows and drifted after her‚Äîslow, unsteady,
spreading into the street and then into the city beyond like water finding cracks.
The humming faded as they disappeared, weaving itself into the night until it was impossible to
tell where the sound ended and the darkness began.",1,1761439726.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

Later, I got introduced to her friend group and ended up talking to her a few times. She was polite and answered my questions but never asked anything about me or tried to continue the conversation. I couldn‚Äôt really tell what her deal was, but I wanted to get to know her better, so I asked if she wanted to meet up for coffee sometime.

So I purchased an AeroPress as was recommended to me by the internet for the fastest/convenient/cheapest way to make some, and some pre-ground coffee called ""Peet's Coffee, Medium Roast Ground Coffee - Big Bang"" because some reviews I read said it tasted like smooth chocolate, which is my favorite sweet that I can no longer eat.

I tried the AeroPress instructions to a T, and it made me spit out the coffee because it tasted so bad. So I started looking up on different techniques to try and get it at least drinkable, and so far have gone through on entire bag (10.5 ounce pack) of coffee experimenting, but they all taste exactly the same. What I don't understand is how there can be so many variations yet they all taste exactly the same. I've tried inverted methods, different ratios, temperatures, steeping time lengths, plunger press time lengths/methods, agitation/mixing variations, 1 or 2 filters, etc.

As I've been through quite a few methods I can't remember all of the ones I've tried, so I was seeking some input on your personal suggestions on what I could try, or what I am doing wrong.

**Trading My Corner Office for a Cornhole Tournament: Finally Pursuing My Passion Projects After 50! üåΩ**

Ever feel like your days are just a series of spreadsheets punctuated by the occasional lukewarm coffee? I did. For a long time. I climbed the corporate ladder, chased the promotions, and finally landed *that* corner office. You know, the one with the impressive view and the slightly less impressive fluorescent lighting.

But somewhere along the way, I started asking myself, ""Is this *it*?""

The answer, thankfully, was a resounding ""NO!""

So, I did something a little crazy (okay, maybe a *lot* crazy to some): I traded in my power suits for‚Ä¶ well, slightly less formal power polos and started chasing my *own* version of success. Now, that success looks a lot more like perfecting my cornhole technique than perfecting profit margins.

Here‚Äôs what I learned (and what you can learn too!) about finally pursuing those long-held passions after the big 5-0:

*   **It‚Äôs NEVER too late:** Seriously. I‚Äôm proof. Forget the age stereotypes. Want to learn the ukulele? Do it! Dream of opening a dog grooming salon? Go for it! I‚Äôm finding out that my so-called ‚Äúgolden years‚Äù are actually glittery and full of potential.

*   **Redefine ""Success"":** Success isn't always measured in dollars. For me, it‚Äôs now about joy, connection, and finally getting that perfect toss.

*   **Start Small, Dream Big:** I didn‚Äôt quit my job on a whim (well, mostly). I started planning. I explored my interests. I took a cornhole clinic (yes, they exist!). You don't need to overhaul your life overnight. Baby steps are still steps! You might be richer than you think‚Äîfind out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb

*   **Embrace the Learning Curve:** I‚Äôm terrible at cornhole. Like, *really* terrible. But I'm laughing, I'm learning, and I'm meeting some amazing people. Don't be afraid to be a beginner again. It‚Äôs exhilarating!

*   **It‚Äôs Okay to Fail (and then try again):** Just because I don't win the local cornhole championship doesn't mean I'm giving up! In fact, I'm even more motivated.

Listen, I‚Äôm not saying everyone should ditch their day jobs and become professional cornhole players (although, if that‚Äôs your dream‚Ä¶ more power to you!). But I *am* saying that it's time to dust off those dreams, explore those passions, and create a life that truly resonates with you, no matter your age.

What about you? What‚Äôs that ‚Äúcornhole tournament‚Äù you've been dreaming of?

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who‚Äôs the real master chef.

I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I‚Äôm basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I‚Äôm a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

You send memes that perfectly capture life‚Äôs chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You‚Äôre thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

The thought was making 50L of coffee for an extended Arctic mission, and for it to be usable as a group ""coffee station"" to fill up on.  But I've not figured out a way to make this happen.

This place is a cancer. Like, literally go to any other coffee shop. Other than scamming people with the prices, this establishment is run by two batshit people who are unfit to be managing even a lemonade stand. 

Some of the things that the owners enjoy doing include verbally abusing their employees, cussing at their employees, intimidating their employees, and firing them just because they don‚Äôt like them. They will also suspend people ‚Äúindefinitely‚Äù without pay, providing them with no date as to when they might be able to have a job again. That‚Äôs NASTY work in this economy.

I (23F) have a friend (29F) whom I know for a year and a half ago (met her at a community reading workshop). We officially became friends this year and started hanging out regularly, either for coffee or to go get books. We clicked so well at first because we do have some things in common (books, similar music taste, etc). But there are big differences between us lately and I don‚Äôt know to address it without probably hurting her feelings. There‚Äôs a group we bonded over but they recently changed so much that I don‚Äôt like them anymore. This group is my friend‚Äôs literal safe space, and so I feel like if I don‚Äôt like them she‚Äôll stop being my friend (which valid, because I wouldn‚Äôt ask her to change who she is).

But what I mean by the post‚Äôs title is that my friend has many mental issues (from what I can tell, not diagnose obv) like depression, anxiety, and she doesn‚Äôt get along with her family. But these issues are getting to me because she doesn‚Äôt decide to do anything about them (like go to therapy, get professional help, take meds). Which I do get, because I‚Äôve had and have issues as well but I have no option but to work through them. I also get that a journey towards a better mental health will never be easy/pretty, and so she doesn‚Äôt want to get help. But then it‚Äôs like she understands she needs help but decides not to and so becomes a victim of her own circumstances. 

I feel so bad thinking these thoughts, and will probably delete this post in a while. My friend has been there for me sometimes: she defended me against a creepy guy and was there for my birthday party. 

I try to be there for her too (getting coffee, talking, making sure she‚Äôs okay) but whenever I want to talk about myself or what I‚Äôm going through (I know suffering isn‚Äôt a competition, and everyone else‚Äôs suffering looks and feels different, but I‚Äôm significantly going through more stuff than her) she doesn‚Äôt say anything or downright ignores me. 

And when we hang out she gets road rage I suppose, like she gets stressed while picking me up and puffs and sighs and drives really fast. 

Speaking of hanging out, she talks about herself and how she hates her life and wishes to escape. Which I know are pretty big red flags because again, I‚Äôve been there. But it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not good enough to be her friend and I can‚Äôt fix her life. 

The fact that I‚Äôm younger than her and know that I can‚Äôt be a victim of my own circumstances, despite going through a lot. 

I don‚Äôt want to stop being friends but honestly it hurts me. But I feel like she‚Äôs at risk and couldn‚Äôt bear to leave her like this. But she doesn‚Äôt want to get help. 

I have a history of ending friendships, but now that I‚Äôm older I want to make sure when is it okay to leave a friendship. Or when to stay. None of my current friends are like her: my current friends and I just fight against all odds despite being sad and overwhelmed and try to see the good side of things. But I don‚Äôt know if my friendship with her is special and should treat is as such. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I might even talk about it with my therapist‚Ä¶

What can or should I do? 

TL;DR: I have a friend of a couple months who has a lot of stuff going on mentally (like depression, at least it seems) but her mental health is impacting mine and I feel the friendship is one sided. I feel she‚Äôs at risk and I don‚Äôt want to stop being her friend, but this friendship is making me feel awful. What should I do?",3,1761438783.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I am a 31 year old male and she is 23.
Not that she is known to be a fearful avoidant but I suspect it‚Äôs the case?
I feel that I am fearful avoidant myself‚Äî but have done the work.

I run and own a cafe beneath a dance studio she would regularly study dance at which is how we met. When she made her interest known, I politely declined because the age gap freaked me out, she was incredibly persistent. I did genuinely enjoy talking to her‚Äî she was very articulate, emotionally mature and we had very similar values and interests. I declined her twice.
She still came to the cafe and after much deliberation and talking with friends‚Äî they told me to not worry about the age gap and that it wouldn‚Äôt matter in the future. Aside from the age difference‚Äî she ticked a lot of boxes.

So I eventually asked her on a date and we immediately started dating. She was incredibly anxiously attached the whole relationship‚Äî and very thoughtful and communicative. I was put on the back foot a little bit as she was very quick to accelerate the relationship. Inviting me to family Christmas after 3 weeks of dating.

She lived out in the country still with her parents and would come and stay with me in the city several nights a week as that‚Äôs where she would dance and we could spend a lot of time together.

She then moved to the city and got a job. So she was studying dance from 9-2 and work at a gym 4-9 5 days a week.
This made our schedules conflict a little as I owning/ operating a cafe was up at 5am 6 days a week. But my one day off was always allocated to her. She was still my priority.

There was a time there I really hit burnout, and she was still wonderful and understanding throughout that. Constantly leaving notes and cards on my pillow saying how much she adored me and was grateful for me and thanking me for showing her what real love was (her ex was physically abusive, cheated on her and cut her off from family) 

After 3 months of her living in the city, she wrote me a text one night saying that she wasn‚Äôt too happy with how we were travelling, that she needed more quality time with a partner and as much as she expressed that, nothing has changed. (She never expressed it like that) the closest was sweet pillow talk of her saying (one night together a week isn‚Äôt enough) she then said I love you with my whole heart but it‚Äôs taking it‚Äôs toll on me.
She would often come over after she finish d work, let herself into her apartment when I was already asleep and slide into bed next to me, that‚Äôs how much she craved closeness. I would often already be asleep due to early starts. (It was very sweet) 
She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs talk‚Äù she started saying things like ‚Äúmaybe we‚Äôre just on different paths‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs like right person wrong time‚Äù 
I said ‚Äúit kind of sounds like you want to break up?‚Äù She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying ‚Äúam I making the right decision, is this the right decision?‚Äù I was rather stoic in the moment and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not for me to say‚Äù so we said our I love you‚Äôs and she left.

The next day I felt off, I didn‚Äôt really want it to end. She then messaged my employee saying ‚Äúhey, are you at work? Is Stav okay?‚Äù 

So I then reached out to her saying something along the lines of ‚Äú I‚Äôm willing to make compromises and sacrifices for us to move forward together, but if you really feel like this is something you need to do, I will respect it‚Äù

She then messaged back saying ‚Äú I love you so terribly much, but I‚Äôm terrified that things won‚Äôt change in the relationship.‚Äù
What she was really referring to later in the message was that I wouldn‚Äôt see a psychologist when I was burnt out from work‚Ä¶ she was worried that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhelping myself‚Äù. Now, I am not adverse to psychology whatsoever‚Äî my bookshelf is full of all the most obscure psychoanalysts from the 1940‚Äôs and have been to psychologists in the past for an ex who cheated on me and more existential things.

What I was doing was trying to employ someone for the last several months so I could take an extra day off, going to the doctors 7 times in the last 3 months as my hormones had crashed due to the sheer exhaustion from burnout. Working hard to be able to support her and have some financial freedom.

She also closed it her notes by saying she was bisexual and was terrified how I would perceive her, and she‚Äôs terrified she‚Äôs never explored that side of herself. 

I responded saying ‚Äúhey, now you‚Äôve articulated this, I think it would be constructive to talk about, do you mind if I come and see you?‚Äù
She agreed, so I went over immediately‚Äî she had been house sitting for a mutual friend, she opened the door and hugged and kissed me for several minutes. (She had been crying in bed all day) 
We sat down and communicated through everything (we had literally never had an argument our entire relationship).

We made a plan to move forward and how we just need to communicate better. I then stayed with her the next four days. Cooking breakfast for her, trying to make her feel safe.. just letting her know that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù 
She even said things like ‚Äúthanks for fighting for me‚Äù and ‚Äúare you sure I‚Äôm enough for you‚Äù

After this rekindling weekend, she came into the cafe saying ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt working for me‚Äù
I felt completely blindsided and shocked.

She then started saying things like ‚Äúthe weekend didn‚Äôt feel how it was supposed to feel, like why weren‚Äôt you doing this the whole time?‚Äù Which is ridiculous, it‚Äôs not like I hadn‚Äôt cooked for her before. I constantly tried to make her feel supported through acts of service. She also said things like ‚Äúmy demons are coming back and it‚Äôs not fair you should put up with them‚Äù I said 
‚ÄúBecause I love you, I will stand by you and welcome your demons as my own‚Äù 
She assured me that she does love me, but love is more complicated than that- that it shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúhard‚Äù. That she needed to try ‚Äúsomething else‚Äî not someone else‚Äù
I asked why she was so sure? She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, it‚Äôs just a feeling‚Äù she then brought up the fact I didn‚Äôt see a psychologist saying ‚Äúwhy wouldn‚Äôt you get help? Why wouldn‚Äôt you help yourself? She was bawling her eyes out, kissing me with her head in my chest at this point. I was so shocked and I said ‚Äúthis is really important to me, you are really important to me and I will fight for this‚Äù I then proposed couples therapy, I said I will organise it and pay for it (I paid for everything) she then asked ‚Äúcan you give me a few days‚Äù she acknowledged how hard it would be for me but I said yes.

The next day a customer from the gym said she was crying at reception at work obviously very conflicted.
So a few days pass, I thought I would leave a coffee at reception at her work for her. So I walked over before her shift started and she happened to be early, pulling in. I was like ‚Äúuhh, this was meant to be a lot smoother, but here you go‚Äù 
She thanked me and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll chat later? Because it will probably be a conversation longer than 5 minutes‚Äù so I went back to the cafe and messaged her at days end saying ‚Äúhey that was by no means me pressuring you to chat, I just thought you could do with a coffee‚Äù 
She then expressed gratitude and that she couldn‚Äôt catch up that afternoon, but perhaps we could wait until after the weekend (it was Saturday) she also acknowledged how hard this must be for me and apologised for putting me through it.

I said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs okay, I then said that I would leave her with some notes following our last conversation. 
It was basically a list of what I thought were unfair presumptions on her behalf‚Äî points she was right‚Äî points I was wrong. How I was struggling with the quick flip after such a constructive reconciliation.

She then responded saying ‚Äúafter asking for space, you have over stepped that boundary, I‚Äôve told you what I‚Äôm feeling and why and you have chosen not to listen- this is done, please respect my boundary‚Äù 

I waited a few days and said ‚Äúhey, I really want to respect your boundary, if what was last said were your parting words, I‚Äôll make my peace with that, if you‚Äôre still open to a conversation I‚Äôd appreciate it or if you just need more time, that‚Äôs okay too.

She then responded disregarding my message all together asking me to lug a bunch of big bags with dance costumes in them which had been in my apartment for 6 months into an uber as the dance company the belonged to needed them. I just did it without calling her out on anything. I felt so disrespected, so a couple of days later I returned her belongings to her housemate along with a letter.

The first third of the letter was holding her accountable for that action, but the rest was really heartfelt and thanking her for our time together. It was gut wrenching actually.

I heard nothing, she didn‚Äôt bother to return my things, then we found her profile on dating apps immediately. She was telling mutual friends that ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt respect her boundary, and I left a 7 page letter she didn‚Äôt even finish reading‚Äù knowing it would get back to me.. as she was saying this directly to my mate that she works with. 
Some mutual friends she dances with came to the cafe, I showed them everything, let them read the letter and all. They were shocked at the level of emotional abuse and how she was contorting the narrative. Telling people that she ‚Äútried to end thing amicably‚Äù by ghosting me and getting me to run an errand?

Her instagram was wild, mutual friends were sending me the reels she was liking‚Äî hyper sexual content, ‚Äú5 signs you‚Äôre dating a narcissist‚Äù type of stuff. Immediately started going out every night with people she doesn‚Äôt even like and palpably just spinning out online. A lot of bisexual coded stuff too.

This to everyone, and people that have known her for years is the complete opposite of what they‚Äôve known her to be.

These two dancer friends wanted to get a coffee with her to suss out what is going on in her mind. On that very day we actually happened to cross paths, I was on the phone but she went out of her way to make eye contact with a sad/ longing sort of half smile.

She expressed to these two mutual friends- still quite arrogantly that she just wanted ‚Äúmore‚Äù from a relationship. But admitted that she handled things horribly and is in therapy. She then said that seeing me that day was kind of nice as she feels like she could reach out and apologise.

I reached out a few days later with a kind message just saying I‚Äôd appreciate a conversation grounded in respect and understanding. She responded with warmth saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been meaning to reach out, I too think it would be good to have a chat‚Äù she then gave me a day and time. 
When that time came she bailed at the last minute. Saying that she‚Äôs been in fight or flight since the breakup and thought she‚Äôd be fine, but she wouldn‚Äôt be communicating so well in such a state.‚Äù 
I was nice and said that I understood and to take her time. I also mentioned that I had sorted out her script for anti anxiety cbd gummies. I ordered them for her before the breakup and they arrived just after we broke up. I still paid for them as a last gesture of good will.

I then reached out a few days later saying that I couldn‚Äôt hinge my closure or clarity on a conversation that may never come and I need to move forward for my own peace, and if she had space for it and if it was okay with her-if I could send a short voice message with my thoughts and that she wasn‚Äôt obliged to reply.

She replied with full hostility saying ‚Äú what more could you possibly say after paragraphs of texts (there was one text) 6 weeks prior which caused her to ghost me. I left her with the letter and was silent ever since.

She then said I had overstepped her needs for space again and again, that she got a text from the pharmacy after I paid for her script after the breakup and it felt like I was trying to buy her guilt or buy leverage.

She said ‚Äúthe way you have been acting since the breakup is deeply concerning, I encourage you to seek professional help so as to stop impeding on my sense of safety‚Äù 

I could not believe it‚Ä¶ so I thought, well This will be the last time I get to say my piece so I just let her know that I felt discarded and ghosted, how it hurt to know how she was speaking about me post breakup with other people, diminishing and belittling me. That I was so worried about her because I felt I had triggered something from her past abusive relationship. Then I called her out gently saying that her behaviour has been emotionally abusive and for someone to champion psychology to not even be able to extend compassion, empathy, admission of mistreatment or any of these fundamental things is hypocrisy of the highest degree.

She then responded saying ‚Äúplease leave me alone, if you contact me again I will seek legal action, and please continue getting professional help‚Äù

This was on fb messenger and shockingly she did not block me, 5 minutes later she angry reacted to my first message‚Ä¶ almost baiting me.

It has been very hard to wrap my head around how someone who was showering me in love and gratitude saying how much ‚Äúhealing was happening in this relationship for her‚Äù so, so anxiously attached. And so consistent throughout the relationship has flipped so violently.
I went to a psychologist immediately, I lost 8kg in 10 days and was surviving on Valium. 

It was like she was going out of her way to hurt me for no reason, telling my friend about a threesome offer from colleagues, talking openly about dating apps in front of him knowing it would get back to me. Getting me to run an errand whilst I was left in the dark.
I can‚Äôt fathom the cruelty. I was not bombarding her with messages or calls. I left her with a letter‚Ä¶ that was it

She was honestly so wonderful throughout the relationship, there was no sign of any toxicity or avoidant tendencies.

It‚Äôs ironic that she implores me to get professional help as so many people have come forward ( her friends) concerned about how unhinged she is appearing on social media and how it‚Äôs the complete opposite of everything they‚Äôve known her to be.
She was an extremely wholesome girl. Only two weeks before this I had surprised at work with cake and flowers and she was utterly beaming. She would constantly go out of her way to shower me in love, gratitude and affection.

1og6tt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EffexorSuccess/comments/1og6tt2/side_effect_caffeinelike_jitters/,Side Effect- caffeine-like jitters,"Hi everyone. 
I am currently on day 8 of a transition from Sertraline (50MG down from 100) concurrent with Venlafaxine HCL XR (75MG). I'm also  on 1mg of Ativan 3 times a day. 

I suffer from GAD, major Health anxiety, Panic Disorder and Depression. 
The original reason for this switch was for a complete mental breakdown - something small just blew up in my mind and I got trapped in the cycle. They tried first to increase my Sertraline with an added 3x daily Valium to stop the crisis spiral of panic and on week 2 I crashed and burned into a major depressive episode. 

So now they're trying Effexor. I'm nervous. I can't tell what is a symptom of the Effexor or the Ativan. 

Anyway, I usually have a two hour nap in the afternoon- I was a huge napper on Sertraline and even before. When I traded the Ativan for the Valium, it wouldn't let me rest for more than two hours- I'd wake up with heart  palpitations (but only after naps). They've gone away now and I was just waking up normally but instead

NOW I woke up from my nap today, feeling like I drank 3 cups of coffee!!! I'm shaking and jittery and  as someone coming over from SSRI's, I was super concerned that the energy of the norepinephrine in SNRI's would agitate my anxiety and make me more high strung. 

Has anyone else had this side effect? Did it go away? People who are taking this for PREDOMINANTLY anxiety and panic, do you find it helped or did it make you more of a hair-trigger? 

Trying to talk with the psychiatrist I'm working with is like pulling teeth and my therapist isn't a doctor so I'm just so nervous. I'm worried he put me on Effexor just for that depressive incident on Valium. 

Even when I eventually wean off the Ativan, what if the Ativan is keeping the Effexor from making me a crazy panic-ridden monster like from the start of all this ?

So I am a UNI student that lives alone, I am so good at my studies or job or even my athlete life but lately I've been feeling very lonely and in need for someone specific. I once entered a class that is not mine in search for some knowledge and Informations there. I already knew vaguely the professor and thought the class I could tell that she was so experienced and smart. At the end of the class I talked to her about why I was in her class and that I study other stuff and she told me to attend her next class because she will mention it (the information) eventually I did and thought the whole session she talked about exactly what I wanted and asked for and while talking she was looking most of the time at me which got me very nervous cause she is so attractive tbh. I started attending more of her classes but I discovered that I am no longer going for knowledge and that I focus on her instead. she is not just attractive but very smart and that turns me on. I have never fell for a teacher or professor but lately all I am thinking of is her and just her. and whenever I see her I get very nervous and I blush immediately without thinking of it and that is so bad because I am a female as well and she is away older than me, can even reach twice my age and I am here all I am thinking of is her and how bad I want her. I've been stalking her social media platforms for two weeks now and I cannot stop it.

I have already flirted with her academically, I told her that I have read her researches and knows who she was and that I am very interested about her researches and writings. And now I am thinking of asking her about her opinion to a website I made filled with some writings of mine but I have no idea how can I start this conversation and if I even should continue with this or drop it or tell her the truth directly (it's going to be a mess and I have a feelings she will laugh at me or maybe get very angry if she was homophobic) Just so you'll know I am attractive myself but I am not sure if she ever will think of me in a out of UNI way.

I don't know if anyone has talked about this yet, but after watching the anime opening a few times, I began to notice some details that could be possible hints as to who might be the end girl of the show. And yes, this is perfectly possible even if the manga hasn't finished yet (the opening for season 1 of QQ contained hints despite the anime airing before the winner was revealed in the manga). I *highly* recommend watching the OP before or while reading this post for better visual context, as I'll only show pictures here instead of the actual clips.

~~I'll also let you know right now that I come from the Quintessential Quintuplets fandom, so be ready for some crazy interpretations.~~

Let's begin:

https://preview.redd.it/8jy8a6bxwbxf1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b79bfcbcb0d5e410e11cd26bdf1557f3373b8cf

***1. The three birds***

Right at the start, we have the shot of three birds flying together, symbolizing the three MIkadono sisters. You'll notice that the third bird (last one to appear for us) is considerably higher than the other two, instead of all three of them flying at the same height. This could be an indication that one of the sisters has the advantage in the fight for Yuu's heart.

In this case, the bird could be representing Miwa, as she is the youngest sister. On the other hand, it could also represent Kazuki, if we think they are in descending order and also consider her role as the oldest one in the family, who needs to look out for her sisters, thus being ""above"" them so to speak. I personally do not think this could be a hint towards Niko.

https://preview.redd.it/7mswtwo71cxf1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=510f37f94d07e1907091ea273be773a515436709

***2. Mugs***

All mugs are different from each other in some way, but Niko's (the yellow one) is the one that immediately stands out not only for its shape, but also the fact that its upper half isn't white like the other two.

However, Miwa's mug has its own unique trait, as it is shown to contain latte (or something similar) instead of black coffee like the others. Of course, one of Miwa's characteristics is her heavy taste for sweets, but it is a visual differential nonetheless - *this will also be important for another clue, so keep this in mind*. Her mug is also positioned in front of the other two, receiving more focus.

https://preview.redd.it/19df93ik5cxf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b3ef7d43220b208efbd84a7b9f3ba5ad9943845

***3. Roses***

The rose that is further down has a different color tone, leaning more towards pink than red. This could be a hint for Miwa, as she is the youngest, or Niko, as she is the shortest. If we make a comparison with the very next shot from the opening (shown above), Niko would be in the same ""position"" as the pink rose.

https://preview.redd.it/zka8t6tq6cxf1.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=a164771043034b87af0aba172fd8c95390da3fc2

***4. Sugar cube***

We see Yuu staring at his coffee with a serious face, before dropping a sugar cube in it. The lyrics at this point of the opening read: *""In these days like bitter coffee, drop a cube of sugar"". S*ugar and sweets are heavily linked to Miwa's character throughout the show. And if we remember *Hint 2*, the only other instance in the OP where there is anything related to coffee, Miwa's mug is the only one that doesn't contain black coffee, which is commonly considered bitter by many people, thus needing to have sugar added to it to make it good. Miwa would be the one who sweetens Yuu's days.

https://preview.redd.it/sin72itr9cxf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a378b1653a5ae927e8f6957409ff09873dc54c

***5. Blushing***

All girls are shown yelling at Yuu, but he's only shown blushing with Kazuki.

https://preview.redd.it/jit9j2a5acxf1.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&s=b35536b47301e8ca5026482cad402d7fcc451cbe

***6. Nails***

The hand Yuu holds seems to have its nails painted with some sort of light orange/reddish color. The next shot of the opening shows that Miwa and Kazuki have their nails painted green and purple, respectively. We do not see Niko's nails, but in many of the manga covers and official art, she is shown to have orange/reddish nails, so this could be a hint that it is, in fact, her hand.

https://preview.redd.it/7i4intpfecxf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ab1968a5699a5718ecca7317cb3d6e86149125

***7. Final shots***

MIwa is the only one who's already completely turned/looking towards us (and symbolically, Yuu) and is actually *shown* with Yuu at this final part of the opening, holding his hand while dragging him along with her. Niko and Kazuki are both looking away at first before looking at the viewer. This could mean that Miwa has some sort of closeness and trust with Yuu that the others don't have.

However, Kazuki's clip also stands out a lot; Niko and MIwa are first shown walking alone at the corner of the screen (see image above) before they cut to their second clips (Niko turning and smiling / Miwa with Yuu). Kazuki, on the other hand, has only one shot of her, where she's in the center and in total focus. It is entirely, different and it breaks the pattern created by what was shown to us with Niko and Miwa.

\---

So, what can we conclude from all this? At the moment, ***absolutely nothing!***

There are ""hints"" for all three girls, and any of them could very well be bait for people like me who overanalyze every detail of just not be a hint at all. I'm currently up to date with the manga, and unless I missed something, I have not seen anything that explicitly points out which of the sisters is going to win, so unless the author herself told the anime creators about this, I personally believe we still don't have many ways to know.

This was simply something I made for fun and because I missed the crazy analysis people made for QQ back in the day. I would love to know what y'all think of this and if there are any other hints in the anime/manga that you've spotted. ;)",1,1761437461.0,MikadonoSanshimaiWa,0,1.0,False

In the next update:

* You can **turn your pet, plushie, or even your coffee mug into a talking AI cameo**
* Sora adds **basic editing tools** (stitch clips, trim, merge, remix)
* **Social channels** (university, company, sports clubs, etc.) are coming
* **Performance upgrades** and **less moderation friction**
* And yes - **Android app is finally coming soon**

This update blurs the line between *AI generation* and *social creation*.  
Sora‚Äôs next phase isn‚Äôt just about video‚Äîit‚Äôs about *community creativity.*

# I for one have already been making some pretty great videos of my pet look alike by just saying ""Put a red fawn french bulldog Lexi as balloon 5 stories tall in the NYC thanksgiving day parade""  Then I imagined my Frenchie was the one who did the jewelry heist at the Louvre and even put her on the Sphere in Vegas!  

But Sora is going to make doing this easier and more realistic!   This is definitely why we need another trillion dollars of data centers!

Full Breakdown

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create AI Cameos of Anything

OpenAI is rolling out a new **‚ÄúCharacter Cameo‚Äù** feature.  
You‚Äôll soon be able to cameo your dog, cat, guinea pig, or even your favorite toy‚Äîand Sora will bring it to life.

You can:

* Generate AI characters straight from your own videos
* Share and remix trending cameos in real time
* Explore a growing library of community-made characters

It‚Äôs like TikTok meets Pixar‚Äîpowered by generative AI.



# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Editing Tools Arrive

For the first time, Sora becomes a **true mini editing suite**.  
You‚Äôll be able to:

* Stitch multiple clips
* Trim and rearrange segments
* Build full-length scenes without leaving the app

This makes Sora not just a video generator, but a creative platform.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Social Layer

Sora‚Äôs next evolution is *social*.  
Instead of one global feed, OpenAI is experimenting with **grouped channels** ‚Äî think:

* University-only communities
* Company video clubs
* Sports teams or hobby groups

AI video creation is becoming collaborative.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Quality-of-Life Upgrades

OpenAI has quietly improved the Sora feed:

* Faster performance & smoother playback
* Less moderation friction (fewer blocked generations)
* Better personalization and trending discovery

These small changes make a big difference for daily creators.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Android Version Incoming

After months of iOS-only exclusivity, **Sora for Android** is officially on the roadmap.  
This will open the gates to *millions of new creators* globally.



This update transforms Sora from an ‚ÄúAI demo‚Äù into a **social creative ecosystem**.

* **Personalization:** anyone can create AI-animated characters unique to their world.
* **Community:** creators can share and build together around shared ideas.
* **Accessibility:** Android launch means a true global creator base.

Sora is evolving into *the YouTube of generative video.*



#  What‚Äôs Next

Expect:

* Cameos + editing tools in the next few days (iOS first)
* Social channels rollout over the coming weeks

1og6mjg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1og6mjg,Amy‚Äôs Diary ‚Äî Saturday: Michelle‚Äôs Spooky Mansion!,"Dear Diary,
This weekend was already exciting because everyone was preparing for the Halloween Smoothie Charity ‚Äî but then a new place suddenly went viral online! It was called Michelle‚Äôs Spooky Mansion, and people couldn‚Äôt stop talking about it.

The videos showed a cheerful blonde hostess named Michelle McBain standing in front of a big house covered in cobwebs, jack-o‚Äô-lanterns, and purple lights. She wore a witch hat and mask and called out:

> ‚ÄúWelcome to Michelle‚Äôs Spooky Mansion ‚Äî where every legend comes to life!‚Äù



I showed the clip to Carmen and Penny, and they both gasped.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù Penny said immediately.

So we did!
When we got there, it really did look like a movie set. Pumpkins lined the walkway, bats hung from the porch, and spooky music played from hidden speakers. Michelle herself came out to greet us, smiling like she‚Äôd been waiting just for visitors like us.

Inside, the rooms were themed ‚Äî one had fog machines and stories about ghost ships, another had glowing footprints leading to a portrait of a vampire, and one room showed the Loch Ness Monster on a misty projector screen.
Carmen pretended to faint in front of a skeleton display, and we all burst out laughing.

After the tour, Michelle gathered everyone in the main hall and said:

> ‚ÄúThank you for visiting, everyone! My new show will air next Friday night. I‚Äôll tell spooky tales inspired by real legends ‚Äî vampires, werewolves, Bigfoot, the Bermuda Triangle, and even ghost towns and alien mysteries!‚Äù



Then she grinned and added her tagline:

> ‚ÄúTruth or scare? Watch it if you dare!‚Äù



Everyone clapped, and I swear, even the pumpkin lights blinked along.

On the way home, Winfrey said she couldn‚Äôt wait to see the episode because she loves mystery documentaries. I told her, ‚ÄúMaybe Zoe‚Äôs Coffee Day could serve pumpkin-flavored drinks during the premiere!‚Äù
Carmen laughed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a brilliant marketing idea, Amy!‚Äù

When I came home, Mom asked, ‚ÄúSo how was the spooky mansion?‚Äù
I told her, ‚ÄúIt was scary in a fun way ‚Äî and educational!‚Äù
She smiled. ‚ÄúGood. Just don‚Äôt bring home any ghosts.‚Äù

I wrote before bed:

> ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äôs coming fast ‚Äî between charity booths, spooky mansions, and smoothies, this year‚Äôs going to be one for the history books.‚Äù

1og6mh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1og6mh9/would_you_visit_a_diy_bakery_where_you_bake_and/,Would you visit a DIY bakery where you bake and decorate your own treats? Looking for honest feedback!,"Hey everyone! üëã I‚Äôm exploring a new business concept and would love honest opinions from this community‚Äîwhether you think it would succeed or fail, and why. I‚Äôd rather hear the brutal truth now than waste money later.

üéØ The Concept: ‚ÄúBake & Decorate‚Äù ‚Äì an experiential bakery

Instead of just buying baked goods, customers come in to decorate or bake their own cookies, cupcakes, cakes, and donuts from pre-made bases or from scratch. It‚Äôs more of an interactive entertainment experience than a traditional bakery.

‚ú® Key features:
	‚Ä¢	You choose a base (cookie, cake, donut, cupcake, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	You can decorate it yourself at your station with toppings, icings, and tools provided
	‚Ä¢	Option to bake from scratch using easy guided recipes on a tablet. 
	‚Ä¢	Great for family outings, dates, birthdays, team-building, and friend hangouts
	‚Ä¢	There will also be a coffee bar and a lounge to enjoy your treats

üéØ Target Customers:
	‚Ä¢	Families with kids
	‚Ä¢	Couples / date night activity seekers
	‚Ä¢	Teens/young adults looking for TikTok-friendly experiences
	‚Ä¢	Culinary students or hobby bakers who want to practice without buying ingredients

üí¨ Questions for the community:
	1.	Would you personally pay for this experience? If yes, how much would feel reasonable per session (per person or per group)?
	2.	Do you see this as a fun novelty or a repeatable activity people would come back for?
	3.	What potential problems or deal-breakers do you see with this concept?
	4.	If you‚Äôve seen something similar, how successful was it?
	5.	What could make this idea even better or more profitable?

I‚Äôm located in Edmonton, Canada, so if you‚Äôre local, I‚Äôd love to know whether this would work in a colder climate with long winters (where people are looking for indoor experiences).

All feedback‚Äîpositive or negative‚Äîis extremely appreciated! üôè
Thank you!

My brain felt like a scrambled clock, always behind on the time.

I was always late.
Late to class, late to labs, late to everything.
I was pulling all-nighters, fueled by coffee and desperation.
Then I found a kids watch with a camo pattern, and I almost laughed.
I found this digital wristwatch online, not expecting much.

I wanted something simple.
Something to help me.
It has a clear digital display and all these functions I didn't think I needed.
I set the alarm for my study breaks.
I didn't expect to use the light, but it actually worked.
It became clear I needed a way to organize my time.

The turning point was small.
I was in a super stressful bio lab.
I was falling behind and totally frazzled.
Then the alarm on my watch went off.
It was time for my break.
I took a breath.
I actually focused.
It was such a relief.

Now, it's the only thing that keeps me on track, even during all-nighters.
I use the alarm and the stopwatch.
I can check the time in the dark.
I can wear it when I wash my hands.
It's just become part of my routine.
I've been recommending the watch to my friends.

If you're like me and need a little help, I swear this little watch is a game-changer.
It's water resistant, easy to use, and has all these features I never thought I'd need.
If you've been feeling the same, it might help more than you think.

1og6isi,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/1og6isi/what_to_donate_to_food_banks_that_truly_helps/,What to Donate to Food Banks That Truly Helps People,"Some folks have said they would like to donate to food banks but aren‚Äôt sure what makes a real difference. The goal is to donate items that are nourishing, usable, and respectful of the people who receive them. Food insecurity doesn‚Äôt erase people‚Äôs dignity or taste buds-
everyone deserves meals that are good, safe, and filling. Donate foods that you yourself would want to eat. Don‚Äôt just clean out the cabinets of food no one  wanted to eat in your home or has gone out of date. 

First, it‚Äôs important to recognize and appreciate any donation, no matter how big or small. Every contribution helps, and food banks work tirelessly to stretch every resource. If you are considering donating, checking if your local food bank or pantry has an online wish list can help target your gift where it‚Äôs most needed. Monetary donations are also incredibly valuable since agencies can buy in bulk or source fresh items suited to their community‚Äôs needs.

High-quality protein is often the hardest thing for people to access. Standard donated tuna and canned chicken are common but can vary greatly in quality and quantity. Donations like solid white albacore tuna, canned salmon, or good-quality canned chicken breast provide more substantial nutrition. Some pantries even accept fresh or refrigerated items such as chicken sausages or apple sausages; checking locally helps ensure donations are suitable. Plant-based proteins like vacuum-packed lentils, black beans, and chickpeas are also hearty, versatile, and welcomed. Peanut butter remains a classic, but alternative nut butters like almond or sunflower butter and tahini are thoughtful options for those with allergies or preferences.

Providing ingredients for complete meals is very helpful. For example, if you donate dry pasta, pairing it with jars of pasta sauce allows recipients to prepare full dishes. Tomato sauce, canned crushed tomatoes, or prepared stews can fill that gap. Staples such as rice, couscous, quinoa, dry baking mixes, oatmeal packets, and shelf-stable milk or nondairy alternatives like oat or soy milk support a variety of cooking needs.

Adding items that enhance flavor and ease meal preparation is appreciated. Olive oil, vegetable oil, salt, sugar, and spices bring vitality to cooking where access to fresh ingredients or seasonings is limited. Quality granola bars, nuts, and dried fruit provide convenient, nutritious snacks many recipients rely on-choosing brands people enjoy ensures donations don‚Äôt go to waste.

Convenience matters greatly. Many people served by food banks work multiple jobs, care for families, or face crises like displacement or health challenges. They don‚Äôt always have access to full kitchens or time for elaborate cooking. Donated protein powders, collagen supplements, and nutritional drinks like Ensure support their daily nutrition needs effectively. Instant coffee or quality ground coffee respects daily rituals and provides comfort. While fresh salad kits or smoothie ingredients can be kind gifts, shelf-stable, ready-to-use nutrition options often better meet the practical demands of busy lives.
Whenever possible, many food banks also accept fresh produce, especially from home gardens‚Äîapples, citrus, hardy greens, onions, garlic, carrots, and squash are valued for their nutrition and storage ease. 

Fresh food is a rare but deeply appreciated addition to donations that are otherwise mostly shelf-stable.

In addition, many food banks welcome essential non-food items, which can make day-to-day life a little easier. These include toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, wet wipes, feminine hygiene products, and toothpaste. Some also collect pet food so families don‚Äôt have to choose between feeding themselves or their animals.

Above all, the most important donation is one given with kindness and thoughtfulness. Donors are encouraged to give what they themselves would eat and use. Avoiding expired or damaged items honors the dignity of recipients and makes distribution smoother for food banks.

Thank you to everyone who donates in whatever way they can. Your generosity makes a genuine difference in many lives every day.",6,1761436918.0,foodstamps,7,0.8,False

For a year now, he‚Äôs been so warm and attentive that it‚Äôs impossible not to feel something and lately, it‚Äôs starting to drain me mentally because I can‚Äôt stop trying to figure out what it all means.

- When I was with my ex partner, he suddenly asked me at lunch ‚Äúif I am still in love my husband‚Äù i replied ‚Äúthat is a strange question‚Äù he said ‚Äúno it is not strange you can decide he is not the right person and someone new comes‚Äù 
- He wanted to see my ex partner‚Äôs photo, we talked about him and he said ‚Äúlucky b‚Ä¶.rd‚Äù
- He occasionally calls me ‚Äúsunshine, darling‚Äù
- He acts very kind and interested towards me: if i say I feel sleepy he opens windows, if I say I want to smoke but I don‚Äôt have cigarettes with me he goes looking for it in the office, when I say I do not feel confident driving yet he offers me to pick his car after office and I drive and practice with him
- He remembers small details I tell him
- When I tell I am seperating with my partner he had a very big smile on his face mixed with big surprised face
- He regularly asks me about my seperation, asks if I am doing well and if he needs to worry about me
- He texted me on Teams that he misses me when we didn‚Äôt see each other for a while
- He asks about me when I am not around
- He comes to my desk almost every day for a chat and he sometimes touches on my upper arm, caresses etc etc
- Finally, he is also seperating from his partner

But nothing ever happens outside the office. No coffee, no messages no socials, no real move forward. It‚Äôs like he keeps me in this warm bubble - close enough to feel special, but never enough to make it real.

And I hate that it affects me so much. I keep wondering if I‚Äôm just an ego boost for him or if I‚Äôm imagining it all. I wish I could stop thinking about it, stop analyzing every interaction, and just let it go.

I just needed to get this off my chest.

Now I‚Äôm learning about my own attachment style, rebuilding the confidence I lost, and finally trying to breathe again ‚Äî without living in constant fight-or-flight.

Has anyone else experienced this anxious-avoidant cycle?
How did you find peace or closure when they walked away without warning?
_____________________________________

Full story:

We were together for four years. I‚Äôve finally reached a place of relief still hurting, still looking for signs sometimes, but slowly understanding things more clearly. I‚Äôve been reading a lot about attachment styles, and realizing that I (F, 30) have an anxious attachment while he (M, 33) is avoidant has brought me a lot of clarity and comfort in understanding our patterns.

The first few months were magical. I truly thought I had found ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù He brought flowers on our first date, texted and called constantly to check in, and planned dates nearly every day. I‚Äôve always been someone who gets attached quickly, so I told him early on that I don‚Äôt sleep with someone until exclusive. He respected that, and we spent nearly every day together and if we couldn‚Äôt, we‚Äôd FaceTime.

Just two weeks in, he said he wanted us to be exclusive. It felt like everything I had ever wanted ‚Äî like a movie romance.

About three months in, I moved to ATL for a new job. I had actually told him on our very first date that I was interviewing for a position there and was really excited about it. He was supportive at first and even talked about eventually moving there too. But after I had moved and been there a couple months, he started getting cold feet. He admitted he didn‚Äôt want to live there long-term. Looking back, I realize he often made promises he didn‚Äôt keep about moving, about trips to see my family, and the future in general.

We stayed together in a LDR. He drove for Lyft on the side, and one weekend while I was visiting, I noticed a message from a girl asking to meet up for coffee. When I asked who she was, he said she‚Äôd been a passenger. It became clear he‚Äôd been getting numbers while driving. He swore it was nothing and promised he‚Äôd never hurt me again.

Around February, my grandmother passed away, and I was struggling emotionally. He pulled away and in short told me to get over it. Side note, I was very close with her especially living close to her I visited her a lot and took care of her when she recovered from a stroke. So that cut deeply. I started questioning where our relationship was headed and him in general ‚Äî if he didn‚Äôt want to move or commit, what was the point? Eventually, I ended things.

But of course, we didn‚Äôt really move on and were still in the shadows of each other‚Äôs lives. By June, we were back together. Another year of long distance followed ‚Äî him shutting down from time to time, me trying to hold us together. Then he got his dream job as a firefighter, and for a while, things felt hopeful again.

That‚Äôs when he told me he wanted to start drinking again, and it was a night after hanging with coworkers. Easier to fit in then tell them why he didn‚Äôt drink. He‚Äôd been sober for years. I was worried ‚Äî especially when he didn‚Äôt want to tell his family. He warned me that if I said anything, he‚Äôd end things and never speak to me again.

Not long after, I was visiting him and we went to a game. We both drank. When it was time to go home, I begged him to get an Uber or Lyft. My phone was dead, so I asked for his to order one ‚Äî he refused, insisting he was fine to drive. Five minutes from home, he got pulled over and arrested for a DUI.

It was one of the hardest things we went through. I stood by him ‚Äî helped financially for almost a year, paid for the lawyer, food, bills, rides, even his kratom teas (another addiction). He told me he wanted to marry me once everything was behind him. I believed him. I figured if I helped him through all of it, we‚Äôd finally move forward. He promised he‚Äôd pay me back once he could.

Eventually, I got a new job and moved back. We decided to live together, even though I‚Äôd always told myself I wouldn‚Äôt do that unless I was engaged. At first, it was great everything we‚Äôd talked about building together. But then the old patterns came back.

Not long after signing the lease, I found out he‚Äôd been messaging an ‚Äúold friend‚Äù from his tea shop ‚Äî flirting, asking for pictures of her work outfits, never mentioning me or that he was moving in with his gf. When she suggested hanging out, he ghosted her. Around the same time, I noticed he had hidden our relationship status on Facebook so people (including women he met at work) wouldn‚Äôt know he was in a relationship.

He started pushing me away whenever I wanted intimacy. I even caught him pleasuring himself a few times ‚Äî once while I was watching a close friend‚Äôs funeral online. When I confronted him, he said I was too needy and it was ‚Äújust easier to do himself.‚Äù The fights became constant. Anything would upset him. He would go silent ignore and try to leave - the one time I made the bad decision to block his car so he couldn‚Äôt leave. I deeply regret doing and know how bad that was. I just wanted him to stay instead of packing up and running to his parents house anytime it got hard.

We started couples counseling and made some progress. But even there, he‚Äôd twist things. I once brought up his gambling ‚Äî hidden scratch-offs, Hard Rock bets ‚Äî and he deflected completely. In front of the therapist, he brushed it off; afterward, he said I‚Äôd embarrassed him and gave me the silent treatment all night.

In another session, we discussed sharing locations as a safety measure, since he‚Äôd suddenly turned his off. He said he wanted ‚Äúmystery‚Äù and ‚Äúindependence.‚Äù The therapist gently explained that it‚Äôs about safety and trust for both partners. He finally agreed ‚Äî for a while, things actually seemed better.

We celebrated the holidays together, and when my parents visited, he asked them for their blessing. My mom even gave him my grandmother‚Äôs ring to propose with. I thought we had finally made it through the storm. But within a month, everything unraveled again. He started picking fights over little things, and whenever I brought up my feelings, he‚Äôd disappear for weeks ‚Äî calling me ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù saying he couldn‚Äôt get past our history.

Still, he‚Äôd come back saying he wanted ‚Äúus.‚Äù We‚Äôd reconnect ‚Äî it felt like old times ‚Äî and then he‚Äôd disappear again. The last couple of months were hard with repeats patterns.

When our lease ended, I moved into my own place. He helped me move, stayed for the week, and it felt like we were rebuilding. He said he wanted to take things slow, and I agreed. One night, he fell asleep on the couch. I tried to get him to come to bed, but he didn‚Äôt want to. His phone was on the floor, and when I picked it up, I saw messages with another girl he‚Äôd met at work. He had asked for her number. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I woke him up, and he brushed it off, saying we‚Äôd talk in the morning.

I went to bed crying and woke up to my dog crying at the door ‚Äî and an empty couch. He‚Äôd gone to his tea shop, then to the casino until 4 a.m., and eventually to his parents‚Äô house. I didn‚Äôt hear from him all weekend. Eventually he came back around, said his father had heart surgery. He ended up staying with me a couple days even though I said how he should go back to spend time with his dad, he insisted on staying. He apologized for his actions and said how much he missed us. He wanted to work on things.

A couple weeks, I asked again where we stood ‚Äî I needed clarity this time. He said he wanted to be together and didn‚Äôt want me dating anyone else. For a week, it was amazing again dinners, laughter, intimacy ‚Äî and then he vanished.

No calls. No texts. Location turned off. I went to the tea shop he always stopped at after work, and we ended up talking and crying. He said he was confused, hurt, didn‚Äôt know what he wanted but that he still loved me and didn‚Äôt want me with anyone else. He apologized, came back for a few days, shared his location again, and things felt good for a moment.

Then my parents came to visit. I asked him to help with my dog while I helped get them to the hotel. He agreed and stayed the night with me. Everything seemed fine. The next day, he left ‚Äî and that was it.

He stopped responding completely. Location was still being shared until Thursday night he stopped sharing. That day I checked his location and he was kayaking then the tea shop at 7pm then can see your location. That Sunday I eventually went to the tea shop again. He said he needed time. I begged for clarity, and he finally said he didn‚Äôt see me as ‚Äúthe one‚Äù like I did him. It felt like my heart dropped out of my chest. He said he‚Äôd talk to his therapist and get back to me after that session, but he didn‚Äôt.

When I reached out days later, still nothing. My calls went to voicemail. Finally, I reached out on Facebook and he sent a long message saying it was over. I was in disbelief. He said we could talk after his next therapy session, but by the time that day came ‚Äî right before noon when he was supposed to call ‚Äî he had blocked me on Facebook and Instagram. My texts were still delivered, but calls went straight to voicemail.

After all that time ‚Äî four years ‚Äî he just vanished from my life.

That final false promise, and for the first time, I feel something like relief. Not peace, exactly, but space. 

I still miss him and sometimes look for signs. I‚Äôm angry at myself for how trusting and giving I was ‚Äî how I‚Äôll never see that returned. But I‚Äôm starting to understand that this was never going to feel safe for me ‚Äî not with how our attachment styles kept clashing. I kept chasing closeness, and he kept running from it.",1,1761436507.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

And with a coffee or a walk it's not too long so worst case it's an hour or so wasted and one of us makes an excuse to leave and we both go on our way

About me: 28M, 5ft10, based in downtown, work in healthcare with some quite variable hours, into a wide variety of nerdy things and would love a movie buddy for my huge backlog or someone to play Split Fiction with. Now that it's Fall I'd also enjoy a nice walk

Not looking for anything sexual (ie furthest I'd go is cuddle during a movie). Also happy if things end up being friends rather than romantic if there's no mutual attraction but still enjoy each other's company.

We've been boating for a decade now, and, while we're not an overwhelmingly large vessel, we have a penchant for going faraway where we look out of place (dock queens we most certainly are not). Recently, we were in a port that must've been in a direly tiny, isolated, and yokelish community, because, for four days in a row now, we've gotten a dozen people a day walking up to us (not just fishermen and marina locals, but passing drivers, bicyclists, and people who don't own boats at all), banging on the hull, and asking questions. Some have been downright concerning, like ""how many people do you have onboard; I've been watching and I see only X many."" Like, yikes, you creep, you're making our female crew and passengers decidedly uncomfortable, get a life.

I know that most of these people are probably kind-hearted locals, and it's highly unlikely we're being cased out for four-dozen simultaneous nocturnal boat heists, but it's rather disruptive and we'd like people to at least be more polite when they inquire about what amounts to our living room that just so happens to have a rudder. So, among other strategies to deal with lookey-lous (I'd also love to hear yours), I thought one thing we could do would be to make a Q&A sign with common questions and sarcastic answers to politely prompt people that they're being uncultured and that we deal with these questions all the time. I'm remembering a ""directions menu"" at a coffee shop a while back informing that they charged a dollar for every time a tourist asked directions to this or that local attraction. I'd love some sarcastic internet brainstorming as to which Q&As we could include; here're mine to start:

Q: ""How much did it cost?"" A: Three, almost four dollars.

Q: ""How much gas does it hold?"" A: As much as a GMC Yukon.

Q: ""Does it come with a Captain?"" A: No, we just let it drift.

Q: ""Where are you going?"" A: Probably not here.

Q: ""Can we come onboard?"" A: How would you like strangers in your living room?

And, of course, Q: ""How many people are on board?"" A: You do realize how rude that is to ask, right?",1,1761436270.0,boating,4,0.6,False

##Novels/Nonfiction Books

1) ***The Kamogawa Food Detectives* by Hisashi Kashiwai**  
Recommended on /r/blogsnark, borrowed from the library, finished Apr 29

Now this is cozy reading. An ex-cop-turned-chef and his adult daughter run a combination restaurant/detective business that promises: ""We Find Your Food."" Koishi takes down all of your info and it's up to Nagare to hunt down and recreate the dish. The descriptions of the food are absolutely _mouthwatering_, and this book readily demonstrates how strongly we tie memories to food.

2) ***Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls: A Handbook for Unapologetic Living* by Jes Baker**  
From my own collection, purchased on Amazon years ago, finished May 4

I've been fat my whole life so I'm pretty experienced with fatphobia as well as fairly comfortable in the skin I'm in. And one thing I enjoy about reading nonfiction is how much it pisses me off. Boy oh boy did this one fit that bill. Not the book's fault, just what the book is talking about. We as a society are so dumb. Look, at the end of the day, just treat people well regardless of how they look: doesn't matter if that's referring to their weight, skin color, height, limb or facial differences, _whatever_. People are people. Respect isn't reserved for the ""conventionally attractive."" What a shitty world this is.

3) ***Cue the Sun!: The Invention of Reality TV* by Emily Nussbaum**  
Recommended on /r/blogsnark, borrowed from the library, finished May 10

I am not exactly a reality TV devotee, but I was in middle school when _Survivor_ premiered so _believe me_ I've been around for the modern boom of the genre. This was absolutely fascinating, deep without being unapproachable, and going back decades to when radio was king and many of the principles driving today's reality TV were invented. Really enjoyable.

4) ***Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly* by Anthony Bourdain**  
From my own collection, purchased on Amazon years ago, finished May 26

What a wild read. There's a lot more to Bourdain than I could cover here -- good and bad; I'm a fan but I know he was far from perfect -- but the book was entertaining, vivid, turbulent, emotional, and interesting. One of my favorite memoirs I've read.

5) ***Zero Stars, Do Not Recommend* by MJ Wassmer**  
Recommended on /r/blogsnark, borrowed from the library, finished May 29

This book was a riot. A bunch of people are staying at a resort when, uh, oops, the sun disappears. Hijinks ensue. It's funny, tense, dramatic, mindfucky, and a lot of fun. Not every resolution is necessarily satisfying but I think for the most part they make sense. Dan is a sadsack, though. The other characters are way more fun. He's like Arthur Dent only less sympathetic.

6) ***Citation Needed: The Best of Wikipedia's Worst Writing* by Josh Fruhlinger and Conor Lastowska**  
From my own collection, purchased on Amazon years ago, finished Jun 3

There's not much of substance here, it's just bad Wikipedia writing and jokes about the same, but it's funny and it passes the time. I mostly bought it because I am a fan of Josh's blog and a longtime Wikipedia gnome. Not all of the humor has aged particularly well but some of the jokes are still really good.

7) ***Before the Coffee Gets Cold* by Toshikazu Kawaguchi**  
Recommended by the dreaded algorithm, borrowed from the library, finished Jun 10

I liked this, but it's kind of like worse *Kamogawa Food Detectives*. The premise is kind of similar -- characters are visiting a place that they've heard can help them solve a specific problem they have -- and both books suffer from some of the same issues, like repetition and tell over show. But I feel like this one doesn't *need* to be like that; *Kamogawa Food Detectives* is trying to tell you about food in a book, it sort of has to be like that. This doesn't. And it kept repeating the central premise over and over and over and over like stop I get it you just told me a chapter ago. Still, the emotions absolutely work, and I generally like the concept, I just wish it were used in a better book.

8) ***Our Strangers* by Lydia Davis**

It's a short story collection so by its nature it's a little hit and miss, and in general I think some of the writing is trying too hard to be like ""wow look how smart I am."" But the hits really hit for me. Addie and her chili will stay with me forever.

Recommended on /r/blogsnark, borrowed from the library, finished Jun 28

Holy crap I _devoured_ this book. I absolutely love fake dating/marriage of convenience stories, so this shit was right up my alley: a guy needs a partner for a birdwatching competition, his best friend finds him one, she misunderstands the assignment and thinks by ""partner"" he means ""girlfriend."" Hijinks ensue. I was into _every_ aspect of this: the competition, the relationship, the best friends' foibles, the daughter's college decisions, all of it. And the steam was perfect. Loved this so much. The main characters' best friends should have a podcast together.

Longtime Linda Holmes fan, bought this when it came out, never read it, finally got nudged into doing so, glad I did. It had so much heart, so much complexity of emotion, some levity in the right places, and painted a vivid, beautiful picture of small-town New England. Thanks, Linda.

13) ***Sonny Boy* by Al Pacino**  
Picked up on a whim because I love this man, borrowed from the library, finished Aug 27

Possibly the best memoir I've ever read. Pacino is a smart, thoughtful dude; if you only know him from his larger-than-life acting roles, do yourself a favor and watch him in an interview, because he is _so_ softspoken and shy. And this book is basically just him going on for 400 pages about life and acting. Not just his, but in general. It's like sitting with a friend who's telling you stories. I read the book but I've heard amazing things about the audiobook, which he of course narrates. It's emotional, funny, insightful, revealing. It's great. I can't recommend it enough.

14) ***The Lost Shtetl* by Max Gross**  
Recommended on /r/blogsnark, borrowed from the library, finished Sep 14

An interesting premise for a book: a small Jewish community has lived in isolation in Poland for so long that no one even remembers that they're there, and crazy shit happens when they make contact with the modern world again. It's really interesting and a page turner. My main gripe with it is it didn't really end in a satisfying way, but at the same time, I'm not sure _how_ you end this book. An ambitious concept and I did like it overall.  
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.75

15) ***The Death of the USS Thresher: The Story Behind History's Deadliest Submarine Disaster* by Norman Polmar**  
From my own collection, purchased on Amazon years ago, finished Sep 19

I wish I liked this more. The content is good, and the story is important. But the book itself, the writing, doesn't stand up to that. It's longwinded at parts that it doesn't need to be, it tries to make up tension that it fails at (the loss of the boat is a foregone conclusion, yes, but you can still play on emotions even given that), and it's just... more boring than it should be. It's also poorly formatted and edited. Not sure if that's just this edition, but it's noticeable and distracting. It's a good primer, but not approachable enough. I know a lot about this story already but if you don't you probably are going to get lost in the jargon.

16) ***The Restaurant of Lost Recipes* by Hisashi Kashiwai**  
Bought from Kobo, finished Sep 21

It's more *Kamogawa Food Detectives* -- there's really not much to add that I didn't say above. I think that's a good thing. I think this entry in the series is better written/formatted, I will say that. Otherwise, it's the same as the first book, just with different stories. Because of that I think these books are better the further you space them out. You may get bored reading them very close together.

Recommended by the dreaded algorithm, borrowed from the library, finished Oct 4

This is also like *Kamogawa Food Detectives* -- although people don't expect this library to solve their problems, it happens anyway -- but unlike *Before the Coffee Gets Cold*, it's so fucking _good_. I think it's much richer because you spend your time with the people who are being helped, seeing into their lives and minds and hearts. It's so emotional and relatable and it killed me at every single turn. I loved it so so so much.

Recommended on /r/blogsnark, bought from Kobo, finished Oct 21

As I said above about *Things They Don't Tell Fat Girls*, nonfiction is great if you like being mad all the time. I have a degree in Spanish language and literature, so I'm used to being mad about colonialism and racism in addition to fatphobia, but _holy shit I'm so mad_. Thank god for people like the ones in this book who are trying their damnedest to enrich the world in any way they can, even if it's one life at a time -- it's one more life, one more _human_, that's getting the health they deserve and a chance at the future they want.

Recommended on /r/blogsnark, borrowed from the library, finished Oct 24

Please read this. It was so fucking good. So fucking funny. I did not see the twist coming. The short summary is a teahouse owner finds a dead guy in her shop one morning and she decides she is going to solve his murder, and in doing so she brings together a bunch of strangers who are solely tied together by the dead guy, all of whom think they might be responsible for his death. Sounds macabre? Kind of is. It's also hilarious. I loved it. I immediately borrowed the sequel from the library, with apologies to my other two library books.

I didn't want to count these above not because they're not books but because I felt silly sprinkling multiple entries of the same series into the above when sometimes there's just not much more to say about it the fifth time than I said the first time.

20) ***The Way of the Househusband* by Kousuke Oonno**  
Read on a whim, bought from Kobo, finished Vols. 1-7 so far (as of 10/25)

I'm a huge fan of the *Yakuza*/*Like a Dragon* games, so this sounded like it was right up my alley: a former yakuza meets a woman who pulls him out of the gutter, they get married, she has a career, so he becomes a househusband. Hijinks ensue. It is so fucking funny. It's just Tatsu constantly getting into trouble and misunderstandings because of his thuggish appearance/mannerisms and his past, and the gags do get predictable, but they work so well for me and I love them so much. The art is outstanding and it totally nails the gritty crime genre while also, like, sometimes Tatsu demonstrates how to properly arrange a flower bouquet.

21)  **Fire In His Fingertips* by Tanishi Kawano**  
Recommended on /r/romancebooks, bought from Kobo, going slowly so no real count (as of 10/25)

Yes, this is a smutty manga about a woman whose apartment burns down and she ends up living with her childhood friend who is also the fireman who rescued her. I'm still early in the series -- I only read like one chapter at a time, I need to pace myself, and this isn't something you just read casually, or at least I don't -- so at least at this point there is a bit of dubious consent. But good god does it work for me. I'm all in. This is good. Also, again, very smutty, so seriously, that's what you are reading it for. Otherwise just avoid it.

I thought it would be a drop-in replacement--just another immersion method, right? Instead I found a few things I didn't expect:

**1. Tastes better (if you're tasting)**

I don't consider myself much of a taster, so I was surprised that I greatly preferred the Switch in two blind tastings I did. It had a pronounced clarity and sweetness that the FP was missing. That said, I'm not sure sure I notice the difference much in day-to-day drinking--and certainly not if I add milk. (Yeah, I know that makes me the minority here.)

**2. Cleanup is easier** 

I think the FP has gotten a bad rap on cleanup; I can clean it in about 30 seconds. But the Switch is like 5 seconds. Makes me want to brew more throughout the day.

...but...

**3. Requires more technique...**

I've used both the Hoffman Daily Driver and the Coffee Chronicler hybrid recipe. I found that both were a little tricky to avoid drawdown stalls. I have something working by using a coarser grind, less agitation, and a gooseneck kettle (which I was hoping to avoid). Conversely, I've had problems with the ""high and dry"" problem when I was careless about not enough agitation. Certainly harder than dumping water in a FP.

Side note: I do have some experience with a Chemex and occasionally a v60, but the Switch introduces some new variables.

**4. ... especially if you want hot coffee**

It's pretty easy to get lukewarm coffee out of the Switch. I can tame it by starting with a hot enough water temperature, rinsing the filter and preheating the cup (steps I was hoping to skip), and putting a plate on the switch during immersion/drawdown. But again, this was never something I had to worry about with my double-walled insulated FP.

Overall I think it's made my daily cup a little better. But it's also made things a bit more complicated, though I kind of like the process. And thus down the rabbit hole we go...

This person - let's call him Mark - has always been pretty level-headed. Good job, family, all the boxes checked. Then a few months ago he bought a boat. Like a real one, a Supra boat. My first thought was honestly ""midlife crisis much?""

But here's the thing. We grabbed coffee last week and he explained his thinking. He said he'd been telling himself ""maybe next year"" for almost a decade. Always a reason to wait - save more money, kids get older, work situation stabilizes. Then he realized the goalpost kept moving and ""next year"" was turning into ""never."" What got me was how calm he was about it. Not defensive, not trying to justify it. Just... decided that waiting for perfect conditions was its own kind of risk. His kids are at an age where they still want to hang out with him, and he didn't want to wake up in five years wishing he'd done this when it mattered.

I keep thinking about my own list of ""someday"" things. The trip I'll take when I have more time. The hobby I'll start when things calm down. The experiences I'm postponing for... what exactly? Some mythical future where everything aligns perfectly? Not gonna lie, part of me still thinks he's being reckless. But another part wonders if I'm just uncomfortable because he's doing what I'm too scared to do.

My HONEST review of Virgin Voyages Brilliant Lady sailing out of Miami this past week (8 nights):

Starting with the positives, here‚Äôs what was coolüëç:

‚Ä¢Adults only cruise.

‚Ä¢Embarkation was seamless (some chatioc moments with the safety assembly but not a big deal).

‚Ä¢Richard Branson actually sailed with us for a few nights, mingled,  had his family on board‚Ä¶very nice human. When he left the boat, he hopped on his yacht parked next to the Brilliant Lady and he gave us a kite surfing show on a typhoon boat at night with choppy Waters (like he was actually performing for us to watch on the balcony) It was like a Richie Rich momentüòÇ

‚Ä¢Kelis concert!!! Really enjoyed most of this aside from organizational chaos, Love that Virgin books well known artists due to their label.

‚Ä¢The staff that clean the rooms are amazing. They are so quick too! Very ready willing, and able to tidy up your room whenever you‚Äôre ready. Very friendly team.

‚Ä¢Room service was pretty timely and some of the better tasting items were on that menu.

‚Ä¢There‚Äôs this chocolate mousse in the to go items that was so decadent ! Same with the Tres Leches cake, ice cream was good and dessert stations also good. The Pastry Chef/Dessert Director does a good job executing‚Ä¶ unlike the Executive Chef‚Äôs execution in my opinion.

‚Ä¢Virgin has its own resort at Bimini, private pool that was big plus beach, meals and drinks. DJ was good.

‚Ä¢The Manor nightclub has a pretty cool set up. They say the Red Room is too but it was mostly closed throughout stay.

‚Ä¢Staff was nice. The server we had at the Wake was incredibly nice. I believe her name was Bokey(sp?).

‚Ä¢Room had practical amenities to maximize on space/storage.

‚Ä¢Upgraded/premium wifi was superb.

‚Ä¢The net on the 16th floor that you can look down and see ocean was nice if you can muster up the courage to get over the fear of walking over it.



What was NOT coolüëé:

‚Ä¢The pool was sooooooo small!!!!It had the nerve to be half wading area where you can dip your feet up to your ankle,  and half where people can dip in their body‚Ä¶the people that were in the side where you can dip in was packed.

‚Ä¢Most of the food (aside
From desserts) was üëé. We picked this cruise as foodies and were sadly disappointed. 

The Galley:
* Unfortunately places like the Ramen spot, Mexican, closed at 4 PM which in my opinion is too early. 
* They had a station that served the same breakfast items every day, not even pancakes or waffles. They had boiled eggs, I cracked 3 and they were all rotten. The breakfast sausage was an abomination. It just tasted like a bag of sugar. It wasn‚Äôt even maple. It wasn‚Äôt savory. It was the worst sausage I‚Äôve ever had in my life, whoever made that sausage really hates people. The rest was hashbrowns eggs cooked to order and bacon plus toast. Their lunch and dinner station was repetitive and super bland. I feel like they made it so you wouldn‚Äôt come back for seconds.
* The included coffee station next to the sushi constantly had spoiled half-and-half milk and I kept alerting the staff‚Ä¶soon as I would pour into my cup of coffee it would curdleüòñ 
* The coffee brand is not good tasted like stale sour coffee. I think the brand is Intelligencia? They either need to replace the brand or do QC checks. I paid for lattes, espressos at the specialty coffee place and it was just not worth it.
* The food at The Wake was horrible. It was inedible. We had to leave our plates behind and I HATE wasting food!!. VERY friendly service, but took a while to get our meals.
* The Spanish tapas place was lackluster even the garlic shrimp, signature Spanish dish missed the mark. 

‚Ä¢You know when people say ‚Äúoh wow, you really cooked with love‚Äù when people cook a meal because it came out good?... this cruise was not that üò≠ I often wondered who is the taste tester because maybe they need to rotate that person.

‚Ä¢The layout of the boat was not easy to navigate, especially getting to floors that had the entertainment. Also, they don‚Äôt have clear marked exits for guests. It‚Äôll just be a gray solid door with no window portal, no sign of where it leads to. The doors look like employees only can enter.

‚Ä¢Virgin should be music heavy and I was shocked that there wasn‚Äôt a DJ  on a consistent basis. It seems like most of it was playlist. The first day we boarded there was a DJ on the deck that was amazing. Had the party going and I thought that the vibe was going to continue on that note and it quickly plummeted and I do not know why. 

‚Ä¢There were so few trash cans on board, literally had to walk front and back to find a garbage can to throw something out instead of littering. This is something minor, but I just found it odd.

‚Ä¢The entertainment director needs to reevaluate their current lineup. The ship lacked in entertainment and simultaneous offerings. We had 4 days at sea on a 9 day trip so it got boring fast.

‚Ä¢It was chaos when the Kelis concert got rained out,
people were running from space to space to see if she would perform the rest as she unfortunately only got approximately 20 minutes on stage before it started pouring. No announcement was made. Then people just followed this long ass line and found out from each other that she would be performing in a different space. It was so chaotic. A madhouse ‚Ä¶poorly executed contingency plan for outdoor event.

Overhyped reviews on food and I have an inclination that its stemming from their marketing strategy. This past week there were a huge amount of people that Virgin gave Free cruises to because they were content creators, so they can advertise their boat on their social media pages. The entire ship turned into a photo shoot/Content creator convention ‚Ä¶. not everybody wants to be filmed and posted during their vacation on a private cruise ship.

Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good for me on Virgin Cruises so I won‚Äôt be a return guest.

Not a one-time mistake. Not a drunken pecking at a work event. A full-blown affair. 
Late at night I accidentally found my husband's messages on the computer.
I saw her name.
Sarah Oakley. His friend from college.
Two minutes ago.
Sarah: I can still taste you
My stomach dropped so fast I thought I might throw up.
My hand moved without conscious thought, clicking into the conversation. The thread expanded, message after message filling the screen. Weeks of messages. Months, maybe.
Until I found it. The message that made everything real.
Emma's working a double Saturday. Can I come over early? Miss you.
I'll leave the door unlocked. Don't make me wait too long.
On my way.
The timestamp said 7:42 AM. Last Saturday. The morning I'd pecked him goodbye before my shift, told him to have a good day catching up on work.
The wine glass slipped from my fingers. I didn't hear it shatter.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The best lies are the ones you tell yourself. Mine was that David worked late because he loved his job.
I was standing in our kitchen at eleven PM, staring at the plate I'd made for him three hours ago. The chicken had congealed into something gray and depressing, the roasted vegetables shriveled at the edges. My own plate sat in the sink, scraped clean an hour ago while I watched Netflix alone on the couch.
My phone buzzed on the counter.
Another hour, babe. Sorry. This case is killing me.
I'd been getting some version of that text every night for six months. Maybe longer. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when a marriage starts to rot. There's no clear expiration date, no warning label that says ""best before infidelity."" The changes come slowly, so gradually you don't notice until you're standing in your kitchen reheating pasta for one, telling yourself it's fine, he's just busy, this is temporary.
The ICU taught me to read monitors, to spot the subtle changes that mean someone's crashing before the alarms start screaming. A slight uptick in heart rate. Shallow breathing. The way a patient's eyes track the ceiling like they're already somewhere else.
I just never thought to apply those skills at home.
David had been distant for months. Not dramatically, not really. There was nothing you could point to and say, ""There, that's when it started."" Just small things. The way he'd angle his phone away when I walked into a room. How he'd started showering as soon as he got home instead of collapsing on the couch like he used to. The fact that ""working late"" had become his default state rather than the exception.
But I was tired.
Twelve-hour shifts in the ICU don't leave much energy for suspicion. And David was on the verge of making partner at his firm, Olson, Chen & Lowe, with it all hanging on this massive class action case his firm had partnered with another firm to handle. High stakes. Long hours. It made sense.
That's what I told myself, anyway.
It was easier than admitting I'd given up med school eight years ago to follow him across the country, only to watch him build the career I'd sacrificed mine for.
I dumped David's plate into the trash and poured myself a glass of wine. My second. Or third. Sad thing to say, but I'd already lost count. Not that I was surprised‚Äîafter a long shift, being awake and semi-functional was already a victory.
Twelve hours of codes and critical patients and families asking me questions I wasn't allowed to answer. God, my feet ached. My back hurt. I wanted to take a shower and fall into bed, but David would feel guilty if I was already asleep when he got home, and then tomorrow he'd be weird about it, and I was too tired for the emotional labor of managing his guilt on top of everything else.
So I waited.
I opened my laptop at the kitchen island, thinking I'd pay some bills or browse mindlessly, anything to stay awake. The screen lit up, and there it was‚Ä¶ David's iCloud account, still logged in from when he'd borrowed my computer last week to print something for work.
His messages loaded automatically.
I should have closed it. Should have respected his privacy, trusted my husband, been the bigger person.
Instead, I scrolled.
Work emails to his paralegal about filing deadlines. A group chat with his college buddies arguing about fantasy football. Messages to his mom about Thanksgiving plans. Normal. Boring. Exactly what you'd expect from a lawyer burning the midnight oil on a massive case.
I felt ridiculous. What was I doing? Snooping through my husband's messages like some paranoid‚Å†‚Äî
Then I saw her name.
Sarah Oakley.
I stopped scrolling. Sarah. His friend from college, the one at the other firm. The one he'd mentioned a few times when the case first started. ""Sarah's lead counsel on their side, can you believe it? Haven't seen her since graduation."" They were working together. Of course they were messaging. That made perfect sense.
Her profile picture loaded. Blonde hair, sharp cheekbones, one of those effortlessly perfect smiles that probably photographed well in every firm directory and legal publication. Beautiful in that polished, successful way that made you feel slightly inadequate even though you knew you shouldn't.
I reached for the laptop lid. This was stupid. I was tired, paranoid, letting my insecurities turn a work relationship into something it wasn't. David was at the office. Sarah was his colleague. They were working on a case together. That's all this was.
But then I saw the timestamp on her most recent message.
11:04 PM. Two minutes ago.
The same time David had texted me that he'd be another hour at the office.
I stared at the screen. Okay. So they were both working late. That made sense, didn‚Äôt it? They were co-counsel on the same case. Of course they'd be messaging at the same time. Maybe they were in different conference rooms, coordinating strategy. Or maybe Sarah was at her own office and they were syncing up before tomorrow's depositions or whatever lawyers did at eleven PM on a Tuesday.
Perfectly reasonable.
I took a sip of wine. My hand was steadier than I expected.
They were colleagues. Friends, even. This was fine. The timestamp was just a coincidence, and I was being paranoid because I was exhausted and David had been distant and I'd had three glasses of wine on an empty stomach.
I should close the laptop. Go to bed. Forget I'd seen anything.
A notification banner dropped down from the top of the screen.
Sarah: I can still taste you
My stomach dropped so fast I thought I might throw up.
I stared at the words. Read them again. And again. Waiting for them to rearrange themselves into something that made sense, something innocent, some inside joke about food or a typo or literally anything other than what they obviously were.
They didn't change.
My hand moved without conscious thought, clicking into the conversation. The thread expanded, message after message filling the screen. I scrolled up. And up. Weeks of messages. Months, maybe.
Missing you already
Tonight was perfect
Can't wait to see you tomorrow
I kept scrolling, my breath coming shorter, faster. Then I found it. The message that made everything real.
Emma's working a double Saturday. Can I come over early? Miss you.
I'll leave the door unlocked. Don't make me wait too long.
On my way.
The timestamp said 7:42 AM. Last Saturday. The morning I'd pecked him goodbye before my shift, told him to have a good day catching up on work.
The wine glass slipped from my fingers. I didn't hear it shatter.
I couldn't breathe. My chest felt tight, like someone had wrapped a band around my ribs and was pulling it tighter, tighter, until something had to break. I pressed my palm against the counter, trying to ground myself, but my hand was shaking too hard.
This wasn't real. This couldn't be real.
But I kept scrolling, and it kept being real.
There were photos.
Sarah in a hotel bathroom mirror, black lingerie. The caption: Waiting for you.
Sarah in what looked like her bedroom, wearing one of David's dress shirts. Nothing else.
Looks better on me, don't you think?
Everything looks better on you.
Something inside me cracked. Not broke‚Äîbreaking would've been cleaner. This was a fracture, the kind that spreads slowly, spiderwebbing out until the whole structure is compromised but still somehow standing.
I thought about last Saturday. Coming home exhausted after sixteen hours of keeping people alive, finding David on the couch watching a game. He'd smiled at me. Asked about my day. Pecked me like everything was normal.
He'd been with her that morning. And then he came home and pecked me.
My stomach lurched. I made it to the sink before I threw up.
When I was done, I rinsed my mouth and wiped my face with a dish towel. My hands were still shaking, but something in my brain clicked over. The same switch that flipped during a code in the ICU, when there wasn't time to feel, only time to act.
I had to pull it together. Had to think.
I went back to the laptop.
The clinical detachment felt familiar. Comforting, even. This was just triage. Assessment. Documentation. I'd done this a thousand times.
I checked other messaging apps, wondering if anything had synced over. His account was logged into WhatsApp, but there was nothing there. He'd been careful to erase them. But, of course, he'd forgotten about iCloud backup.
He'd been careful. Just not careful enough.
I found the credit card we'd opened two years ago and never used. Except David had been using it. Hotels. Restaurants. Lingerie purchased in a size that wasn't mine. Five months of charges.
His location history told me the rest. The same hotel, over and over. An address in the city I didn't recognize. Every pin matched a night I'd been working.
I screenshot everything and emailed it to myself.
Then I closed the laptop.
The kitchen came back into focus slowly. The shattered wine glass on the floor. The dark red stain spreading across the tile like blood. My hands were shaking again; they had been shaking the whole time, I realized. I'd just been too focused to notice.
My heart was racing. Pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples, behind my eyes. The tunnel vision I'd had while documenting everything started to widen, letting the reality creep in at the edges.
David was cheating on me.
Not a one-time mistake. Not a drunken pecking at a work event. A full-blown affair. Five months, at least. Maybe longer. With Sarah, his beautiful, successful, daughter-of-a-founding-partner college friend. In hotels. In her bed. While I worked twelve-hour shifts and came home to an empty house because he was too busy building his career (our future, he always said) to even have dinner with me.
I sat down at the kitchen island. The broken glass crunched under my feet.
The clock on the microwave said 11:47 PM.
David would be home soon. Another hour, he'd said. That meant midnight, maybe 12:30 if I was lucky. He'd walk through the door with his briefcase and his tired smile, peck me on the forehead, ask about my shift. Like he always did. Like nothing was wrong.
I pulled out my phone and opened my email. The screenshots were all there, waiting. Evidence. Proof. Everything I needed.
I thought about what came next. The conversation we'd have. The crying, the apologies, the excuses. Him telling me it meant nothing, that he loved me, that he'd end it. Me having to decide whether to believe him. Whether to try to fix this.
Whether I even wanted to.
Or maybe‚Ä¶ maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be like that. Maybe he‚Äôd be happy he‚Äôd been caught. Maybe that‚Äôd give him the opportunity to leave and be with Sarah. Was he that kind of man? A coward?
I looked around our kitchen. At the plate I'd made him, now in the trash. The wine stain spreading across the floor. The broken glass I hadn't bothered to clean up. Eight years of my life in this house, with this man, building this future.
I'd given up med school for him. Moved across the country. Put my career on hold while he built his. And he'd repaid me by screwing his college friend in hotels I was helping pay for.
I stood up. Walked to our bedroom. Pulled his suitcase out of the closet and threw it on the bed.
Then I started packing his things.
....
I heard his car in the driveway at 12:17 AM.
The suitcase sat by the front door, zipped and ready. His work suits. Enough shirts and pants for a week. Toiletries from the bathroom. I'd packed methodically, efficiently, the same way I'd document a patient chart. Everything he'd need.
My hands weren't shaking anymore. That surprised me. I sat on the couch in the dark, phone in my lap, and my hands were perfectly still.
Inside, though, I was falling apart.
My heart was racing so fast I felt lightheaded. My thoughts kept fragmenting, flashing between the photos on his phone, the lingerie charge, the timestamp that said 7:42 AM, the look on his face when he'd pecked me goodbye last Saturday. I couldn't hold onto any single thought long enough to make sense of it. Everything just kept splintering and reforming and splintering again.
But outwardly, I was calm. Years of ICU nursing had taught me that. You can be terrified and exhausted and heartbroken, and your hands will still do what they need to do. Your face will stay neutral. Your voice will stay steady.
The engine cut off. Car door opened, then closed. His footsteps on the walkway.
I took a breath. Held it. Let it out slowly.
The key slid into the lock.
The door opened. Light from the hallway spilled into the dark living room. David's silhouette filled the doorway: briefcase in one hand, phone in the other, shoulders slumped with exhaustion that I might have felt sorry for if I didn't know where he'd actually been all night.
He stepped inside and fumbled for the light switch.
""Emma? You still up?""
His voice was warm. Concerned, even. Like he gave a screw whether I was awake or asleep or dead on the kitchen floor.
The light came on.
He saw me first‚Äîsitting on the couch, phone in my lap, staring at him.
For a second, I just looked at him. Really looked at him. David. My husband. The man I'd fallen in love with in college, who used to bring me coffee during all-nighters, who'd held my hand when I got my med school acceptance letter and cried with me when I turned it down. Still handsome at thirty-two, in that polished lawyer way. Sharp jawline, dark hair he kept just long enough to run his fingers through.
He looked exhausted. Tie loosened, shirt wrinkled, the kind of worn-down that came from a long day at the office.
Except he hadn't been at the office.
I thought about Sarah in those photos. The way she'd looked at the camera. The way she'd posed for him, knowing he'd be looking at them later. I wondered if he touched her face the same way he used to touch mine. If he pecked her the same way. If she got the version of him I'd fallen in love with, or if that man had disappeared years ago and I'd just been too blind to notice.
David's face shifted. Confusion, maybe. Or the first hint of wariness.
Then his eyes tracked to the suitcase by the door.

1og5ft7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1og5ft7/truck_49/,Truck 49,"Truck 49



I worked as a delivery driver. I wont say what I delivered as to not implicate the company I used to work for. The following took place a couple of years ago. I used to love my job. I'd arrive to work first thing in the morning, after stopping for coffee, and start loading up a truck that was designated to me. 



I originally had Truck 95; I kept her swept and clean. The trucks we drove had a drivers side door, a passenger side door, a passenger side unloading compartment, and a rear door. The setup was kind of like a short school bus. Though instead of kids; we had product on both sides. The middle aisle allowed for large quantities to be carted out the back.    



Before loading up my truck I'd usually make small talk or joke with my morning coworkers. Other drivers would be loading up for the day and we'd throw random friendly insults at each other. I would be called a crackhead for being so loaded up on coffee and chipper. We'd all fat shame Eugene, call Jeanie a robot, and question Jackson about rather or not he was on steroids. 

Eugene was a heavy set and jolly redhead. He started out organizing the product for us each day until a new truck was available for him. Normally you'd expect us to have enough trucks for everybody, but the darn things kept breaking down and needing repairs.



Jeanie had Truck 11. I mentioned my truck was clean, hers was spotless. She would always contribute to the morning banter, but she would always be focused on getting her truck loaded and paperwork signed off on. Jackson had Truck 49. Jackson was built like a tank and always seemed to be angry about something. Sometimes he'd respond to people and sometimes he didn't. Fortunately, when he did talk, it was always to say hi or joke back. If someone said hello to him and he didn't respond, we'd just give him his space. 





One morning I came in and everyone was gathered in the manager's office. I only named three people because those are the only drivers beside me that really matter for this tale. There was about eight people crammed in there not including the manager himself. When I strolled up to see what was going on, one of my other coworkers turned away from the office: laughing and shaking his head. I let a few more out before finding my way in toward the manager's desk. Jackson was standing next to our manager Seth as he rewound footage from Truck 49's front facing security camera. The cameras were normally there to make sure we were paying attention while driving and to see who was at fault in an accident. 



Seth hit play on the screen and the video feed showed an elderly woman walk out in front of Jackson's truck. He appeared to hit her head on without slowing. Only after running her over did he slam his foot down on the breaks. There was an audible squeal as the truck rapidly slowed and veered to the right. Seth clicked something on screen and brought up the driver facing camera. Jackson's head was buried in his cellphone and only glanced at the road just in time to see the woman go under the front of the truck. 



My eyes went wide and I stepped closer to the computer. Jackson, on screen, jumped out of the truck and ran around it. Seth turned toward me and said ""check this out."" He opened up a four panel camera view and showed around Truck 49. Jackson was making his way around the truck looking for the woman, but there was no sign of her. 

""That shit was crazy."" Jackson said shaking his head. ""That bitch was no where to be found. It looked like I hit her, but I swear I didn't hit anybody. I'm good to go right Seth?"" 



Seth gave Jackson the go ahead to leave before rewinding the camera again. He started playing the clip of the woman walking out in front of the truck over and over. I asked him if he was going to check with local law enforcement to see if anyone had been hit in that area. He told me Jackson had called him right after the incident and had called them himself. An offer arrived at the scene, but never found any sign of anyone being hit. 



That was the beginning of what we called ""The Curse of Truck 49.""

The curse hadn't truly been called a curse until about a month later. I didn't find out until the following morning after it had happened. I arrived to work like any normal day and saw Eugene getting the keys to Truck 49. At first I was happy for him. I asked him cheerfully ""they finally got a truck for you?"" Eugene looked back at me with a solemn expression and responded ""Yea, Jackson's."" 



He then went about his business as if there was nothing else to say. I followed Eugene out to the truck and asked if Jackson had the day off. Eugene simply told me to go ask Seth. Once I was in the manager's office, Seth informed me of what had happened to Jackson. He had run out of the truck and was hit by another vehicle. He told me he had watched the camera feed of it. Jackson looked like he was freaking out and stopped the truck on the side of a highway. He had just about jumped out of the truck before the camera lost sight of him. The company had gotten a phone call from the first responders to arrive on scene. 



For the following couple of weeks it was Eugene's turn with Truck 49. After the footage of the ghost woman disappearing upon being hit, and now Jackson dying, the truck was quickly getting a reputation. Eugene only added to it. Only a few days driving and Eugene started telling ghost stories in the morning about hearing a scream while driving or seeing someone out of the corner of his eyes. We thought he was screwing with everyone until I arrived one morning and Eugene was gone. 

Fortunately he was spared Jackson's fate. One of my coworkers told me Eugene had parked Truck 49 in a gas station parking lot and called Seth, crying, refusing to get back in the truck. Seth had to get another coworker to drop him off at the gas station and drive the truck back to the branch. Eugene had left the keys on one of the tires and quit. 



Truck 49 sat without a driver for several weeks. There were a few occasions where it was needed, but Seth saw it wise to not force anyone to take it. Seth himself ignored the subject of the curse, but he  definitely seemed to believe something was wrong. 

Once Truck 11 broke down it was Jeanie's turn at the wheel. 



I remember Jeanie's stoic demeanor being her most defining trait up until she had taken over Truck 49. She would give the typical short chuckle in the morning as people joked about the haunted truck, but it never seemed to bother her. She was there to earn her paycheck and go home. When Truck 11 broke down and needed weeks of repairs, Seth gave her the choice. She could help load up other trucks in the morning or use Truck 49. Not being a driver would mean going home early. That translated into less hours and a smaller paycheck. Jeanie could care less about ghost stories; she needed the money.



Almost immediately after taking over 49, Jeanie's demeanor changed. She slowed down in the morning and took her time talking to other coworkers. She used to pull out of the parking lot long before me, now she was almost the last one out. She seemed almost giddy and nervous every morning. She never said anything to anyone about the truck. Then one morning she had had enough. She went into Seth's office and offered him two weeks helping other drivers in the morning or she would quit on the spot. She refused to drive Truck 49; she refused to drive any truck at all. Seth accepted her two week notice and kept her at the branch for her last days working with us. She never explained her decision to leave. She would just tell anyone who asked that she had gotten a better offer. That was until her last day. Before I had driven my truck out in the morning, I overheard Jeanie telling others never to drive Truck 49. She told them the truck was damned. 



The infamous truck would sit driverless for over a month. One of our drivers was in a nonfatal accident and was back to work the next day. Luckily Truck 11 had been repaired by then. 49 wouldn't be needed until the day I was halfway through my route and the transaxle gave out on Truck 95.

I had to be towed back to the branch. I knew the bad news before I had even made it back. 95 was going to be downed for a while and the only truck we had left was 49. I was honestly excited about it. 



The following morning I arrived with a great big cold brew in hand and a big dumb grin on my face. I made jokes about ghost hunting to my coworkers as I loaded up the truck. Seth made sure I had his number and to call if I had any issues. He joked with me not to call crying as he didn't want to have to come pick the truck up again.



My first day driving Truck 49 was without any issues. My day breezed by almost disappointingly. On my second day, I had stopped for gas when I had my first incident. I had gone into the station and bought an energy drink. I was on my way back to the truck when I thought I had seen someone moving around inside. Once I had gotten into the truck and saw no one there, I simply shrugged it off. 



I was on my way to my next stop and had entered the highway. The truck had gotten up to about 55 miles per hour when I heard a strange noise just under the sound of the engine. The sound grew louder until I could make out what sounded like a high pitched scream. I paused the music I was listening to and sat there dumbfounded while trying to determine the origin of the sound. I worried it might be the serpentine belt or the brakes. I pulled over the truck and the sound stopped. I shot Seth a text about it and continued on like normal. The rest of the day went by without anything strange happening. 



My third day and it started off early. I was on my way to my first stop when the strange screaming sound started. It was just like last time. I was the highway and the sound slowly grew louder until it sounded like a woman screaming in agony. I pulled the truck over and the sound stopped. I continued toward the first stop and the sound hadn't started again. I kept my music off and just rode in silence trying to hear anything unusual over the sound of the loud truck engine. 



I reached my first delivery location and dropped off my product in record time. The customer signed and I was away to the second location on my list. I didn't bother with music anymore. I listened carefully for the scream, but it didn't come. Instead, I heard a strange knocking sound on the passenger side door. I couldn't see anything in the side mirror so I ignored it. Then I heard something moving around in the back of the truck. I glanced back, but saw nothing. There was a sound like foot steps walking around in the very back that kept grabbing my attention. I tried to pay enough attention to the road while repeatedly looking behind me. I made sure there was a significant distance between me and any other vehicle so I could keep checking. Every time I looked there was still nothing. The foot steps continued slowly, then broke into a dead sprint up the middle of the truck toward me. I hit the break and swerved into the shoulder. My fight or flight reflex kicked in and I was grasping for the parking brake as I fishtailed off the road. 



I jumped out of my seat, heart racing. I slowly walked to the back of the truck checking in-between the shelves of product. I kept expecting a stowaway, a thief, someone. After fully checking the inside of the truck, thoroughly, I sat back down in the drivers seat and tried to calm myself down. I tried to reflect on what had happened. Right before I had slammed my foot on the brake, I remembered a darkness out of the corner of my eye as the sound of the footsteps reached me. 



While I sat there another driver casually pulled by next to me and checked to see if I was okay. I gave them a thumbs up and they drove away. I finally pulled myself together and put my seatbelt back on. I told myself nothing had happened to Eugene or Jeanie and put the truck in drive. The screaming started almost immediately. 



A blood-curdling scream pierced my ears and forced me back in to the shoulder. It was coming from under the truck, I was sure of it. I grabbed a broom I kept in the truck and jumped out. The screaming stopped before my feet hit the ground. Determined, I lowered myself to the ground and gazed up under the truck. I could see a large black mass clinging to the underside toward the center. I jabbed at it repeatedly with the broom. I was hit with a strong smell of roadkill and burnt rubber as part of the mass gave way. I dropped the broom and covered my nose and mouth, trying to protect myself from the smell. 



Staring back at me was a blackened face still frozen in a scream. ",1,1761433830.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It is rare that he does a 3 hour stretch. I am exhausted and that is the primary issue. My fiance has started to help in the beginning of the night but my son typically demands the breast. 

I am okay with breastfeeding during the day but I HAVE to night wean. I have reached my breaking point I think. My mood is a bit low with the weather changing (I live in PA). I am just not tolerating it anymore. I work 2 24 hour shifts Saturday and Sunday. (Yes, 8am sat to 8am mon) and I typically never get called out at night but when I do- it‚Äôs killer. 

I care for him mon-fri pretty much all day while my fiance works. I love being a mom, I love breastfeeding and I‚Äôve been trying to let him lead the process but I also want to have the energy to be a good toddler mom, who exercises and doesn‚Äôt have to rely on coffee all day. 

I don‚Äôt know what im asking. Maybe I‚Äôm just looking for support or validation. I want to comfort him how he wants.. I‚Äôm just getting very worn down. ",4,1761433389.0,breastfeeding,3,1.0,False
