1fzmeu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterraceFR/comments/1fzmeu6/demande_conseils_pour_amélioration_config/,Demande conseils pour amélioration config,"Bonjour à toutes et à tous,

  
Dans l'optique de pouvoir jouer à Monster Hunter Wilds dans de meilleures conditions (sortie fin février) je souhaiterais pouvoir bénéficier de vos précieux conseils dans la perspective d'amélioration de ma config actuelle qui date de 2019. Voilà de quoi elle est composée pour le moment :

Boitier : Be quiet! BGW25 Boitier pour PC orange

SSD : SAMSUNG 860 EVO 250 Go

Ventirad : NOCTUA NH-U12S

RAM : Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 Go DDR4 3200MHz C16 XMP 2.0

Carte mère : Gigabyte Z390 GAMING X Carte mère Intel Socket LGA 1151

Processeur : INTEL I7-9700K Coffee Lake R LGA 1151

GPU : VGA GIGABYTE RTX 2080S GAMING OC 8G

Alimentation : be quiet! Pure Power L8 Alimentation ATX 630W modulaire certification 80 Plus Bronze

Ecran : BenQ ZOWIE XL2411P 24 pouces, 144hz

  
Mon but de manière générale est de pouvoir jouer aux jeux vidéo récents (pas que MHWilds) en 1440p avec une garantie d'au moins 120fps constants.

J'ai monté mon PC tout seul mais je ne m'y connais pas trop en terme de compatibilité de composants, voilà pourquoi je me tourne vers vous. J'aimerais pouvoir ne changer que d'écran et de carte graphique mais j'ignore si c'est viable compte tenu des objectifs cités plus haut. 

  
Mon budget serait de 1000€ s'il n'y a qu'un écran et un GPU à changer. 

Pour ce qui est des écrans, j'ai regardé un peu ce qu'il se faisait et celui-ci m'a l'air pas mal, il regroupe un certain nombre de mes critères (notamment en terme de connectique avec au moins un display port, un HDMI et un jack) : TUF Gaming VG27AQ HDR - 27 poucesASUS. 

J'avais vu aussi celui-là mais le pied ne me convient pas et prendrait trop de place sur mon bureau :  AOC Gaming Q27G3XMN - Moniteur QHD 27 pouces.

  
Pour les cartes graphiques j'ai aussi un peu regardé mais je ne suis pas capable d'identifier le meilleur choix vis-à-vis de ma config actuelle mais j'ai vu des choses intéressantes dans les 600€-700€.

  
Petite dernière question, faut-il que j'attende avant d'acheter sachant qu'une nouvelle génération de GPU risque d'être annoncée/de sortir en début d'année prochaine et que cela pourrait entrainer une baisse du coût des générations précédentes?

1fzm4ah,https://i.redd.it/5tli21e3rotd1.jpeg,Review of my Zoologist collection so far. ,"In clockwise order:

* Elephant: this is a very grassy, leafy scent. I've never smelled a perfume like it. It reminds me of a forest or think, high grassy area after a fresh rain. After a while, it smells much more chocolatey. Not something I would personally wear often, but still very nice. 

* Harvest Mouse: delightful! To me, this smells like the perfect mixture of honey, grain, and beer. After a while, I could smell the beer more prominently. Reminds me of an early summer day without a cloud in the sky. In my opinion, this is a very safe blind buy. 

* Camel: a bit hard to see in the photo, but it's the travel spray. Initial spray is very sweet with the smell of dates coming on strong. After the dry down, the other notes bring more floral scents up. It's quite exotic and brings up images of a nice smelling Middle Eastern outdoor market with various scents on the wind. I really love this one and I'll wear it often. 

* Rhinoceros: it has a divided reputation, and most people either love it or hate it. I'm on team Love It. The initial smell is quite funky. However, the dry down on the skin makes it worth it. It's a mix of earthy dust, rum, coffee, leather, and tobacco scents. I smell a plum scent after wearing it for a while. It's very masculine and it won't be a hit for a lot of folks out there, but it's one of my personal favorites.

* Moth: this one is an odd duck. Initially, it has a very sharp, sweet scent that brings back memories of my grandmother and her old closet. It's very powdery, feminine, and floral with a mix of spiciness in there, too. I love the floral scents, but the sweet scent is a bit much for me. Probably won't buy it in the future. I've heard this is a good scent for goth girls (feel free to give your opinion if you're a goth girlie who's tried this). 

* Musk Deer: wasn't sure what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised! The initial thing that stood out to me was incense, even though it's not listed in the notes. There's a bit of lemon, sandalwood, cedar, and rose. Honestly, it smells like walking into a hippie or metaphysical store. It's a really nice balance of musk and citrus. I plan on wearing this a quite a bit in the future. 

Well, there you have it! Zoologist is a wonderful niche brand that has some real bangers. If you haven't tried any of their stuff, I recommend buying a few samples to see what you like. ",4,1728460032.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

1fzm1i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fzm1i9/my_dads_whore_wife_is_destroying_our_relationship/,My dads whore wife is destroying our relationship ,"Off the bat I apologize for how long this is. 
My(f25) dad (m 59) is an alcoholic, has been one for years and never properly addressed the issue until recently. For context, I do not get along with his wife(a lot of history there that would take pages upon pages to type) at all but for the sake of his sobriety and my sanity I have tried to just say nothing about her/ complain. They had a non refundable booze cruise planned months before we had officially addressed his drinking issues and his wife decided to go on the cruise with him although he had only been sober for maybe a month and he relapsed and then I  involved his family( my dads sister, brothers, mom and my cousins). My dad has a lot of pride and this has been very hard for him but everyone has been supportive except for, in my opinion,  his wife. 

We did a 3 way call at some point after his second relapse and if you knew me you would know just how insane it is that I was on a fucking 3 way call with my dad and his wife with the way my relationship with his wife stands but like I said, I was trying to put my shit to the side because this way about my dad. On the call,  she was just furious and threatening to leave him and that he's going to die before he's 60 (mind you she was also the one that drank with him on the cruise when he was freshly sober.) I hate that she's the one with him all the time because she's doing a horrible job. ( my brother and I don’t live with my dad anymore) She just makes him feel bad. The fight that happened a few days ago involved him calling me about a normal thing and then went off the rails fast. I also could tell he was in a horrid mood off the bat. He  starts talking about randomly drinking wine every once in a while and I tried to explain very calmly that I did not think that was a good idea or something he should even be thinking about right now because it's not important. He has said the drinking wine thing multiple times in the last 2 months when he's only been sober for maybe 6 months but i'm not even confident he's sober because he slips up so much (we have caught him drinking beer instead of “sparkling water”) but anyways it's concerning and I feel his bitch wife is trying to get him to drink. ( I remember her berating him about how they used to be able to drink together so what happened so she's mad he's sober but mad also when he starts drinking again.) 

He immediately got defensive and aggressive and then I asked who he's talked to this about and asking if he's spoke to his therapist and he says no and that he's talked to me and his wife and I must have made a noise but I did not say much other than something around the lines of we are both not who you should consult on this and also like no drinking at all if you're an alcoholic and I had also NEVER confronted him about his wife’s  foolishness with letting him on the cruise or anything else she's done recently because im trying to not stress him out but he starts getting aggressive saying don't start going on about my wife, she's the one that's been supporting me and she started all this like no she didn't and no she isn't but I didn’t actually say any of that, I said “well seeing as she's the one who took you on the booze cruise and drank with you while you were freshly sober i'm not sure how much I trust her judgement” and he did not like that remark and just starts being all defensive about his wife and how the ticket was non refundable and now claiming it’s not a booze cruise but that he bought the drinking tickets so they could drink coffee??? and asking me if he should have just cancelled the trip and not received a refund and I said are you fucking kidding me of course when your health is at risk (my dad is 59 with high blood pressure and years of alcohol abuse but overall okay but still don't think alcohol is ever a good option for him anymore nor will it help any of his preexisting conditions.) 

He just starts getting mad saying that's ridiculous and that his health is fine and that he realized (emphasis on him because no therapist or doctor has made this conclusion) he doesn't have a chemical addiction but rather he went thru things"" and used it to cope and kept saying how I was saying he's not capable or that he's going to fall off the wagon and that was making him super upset but I never said any of that and have only ever been supportive like I have never got angry with him  through this entire situation and told him he was projecting. The one who was actually a non supportive bitch was his wife. He kept saying because he was an alcoholic for this last year that he is fine but he's been one for YEARS he's just in denial. It's catching up with him now that he's older but he's always had a problem. I mentioned the times he drove my brother and I drunk on multiple occasions (sometimes I had to take over the driving) or just when he would lie and say he was at the gym growing up and we could smell it on his breathe.

He got defensive again and just yelled that he didn't want to talk about this anymore. At this point I was very upset because I did not expect to get in a fight with my dad especially after holding my tongue on things to do with his horrible wife in order to to keep the peace so I was blind sided and really confused as to why he was being so mean to me and aggressive so l ended the call crying saying i didn't understand why he was treating me this way but that I could not handle it. 

My dad usually looses his temper but calms down quick. I had texted him because I didn’t want to talk on the phone anymore(i’ll just upload the screenshots if I can of text messages). My mom, my bf and my brother are furious and tell me not to talk to him. Brother says he will handle the communication from here on out. Fast forward to the next day I genuinely thought he would have calmed down and felt bad for being so fucking mean but I was very mistaken. 

We were actually supposed to see my dad (my brother and I) for dinner that next night and due to all the fighting the day before, I told my brother I was unsure if I wanted to go and he understood but then I thought it might be good to have a conversation about this all in person. My dad is not answering our group chat so I decide to call him(my brother offered but I said I could because I genuinely didn’t think it would go so bad)

My dad is cold and curt off the bat. He asks what’s up and I just say I’m checking in to see if he still wants to meet up later. He says sure with like zero enthusiasm so atp i’m like okay well if you don’t want to see me right now then that’s fine we can do it another day. He says well you know i’m actually really not happy with the way you talked about my wife. I genuinely don’t understand wtf I said that was so offensive but i’m certain it’s just because her devil ass is in his ear. I told him I once again stood by the fact that I criticized her decision to go on a booze cruise with you and also for the way she’s been handling/speaking to you on multiple occasions about your addiction. To spare more word vomit we just start fighting like he is furious with me for “talking about his wife that way” and telling me to be a “fucking adult” and I got so fucking triggered. To explain why I got triggered in detail abt this situation would take idek how long but my history with my dad and his wife is very rocky/ problematic and has been for years and I was seriously trying so hard to not say a fucking word about anything this entire year, even when something upset me because I didn’t want him to get stressed and relapse so him blaming me for causing this fight and just screaming at me made me incredibly upset. I am unfortunately very ruled by my emotions in arguments so I ended up just sobbing and screaming at him which I know is not productive. This conversation now was like fully about how I don’t get along with his wife and he’s screaming at me about how my brother and I have not accepted her and how we need to respect her and “get over it”. (very short explanation for my history with his wife is that one of her sons was best friends with my brother in grade school and in turn she became best friends with my mom who was still married to my dad at the time. They ended up having an affair and he’s now married to her and left my mom. There is so much more filler as to just how fucking rotten of a person she is but that’s all I can type rn beacuse this is already so long)told him how he has no idea the position he’s put me in with this wife and how my brother and I will have to deal with her for the rest of our lives if we want to have a relationship with our dad. I told him it’s unfair to ask me to push past a healthy boundary i’ve put in place for myself with his wife and that i’ve already gone way past my comfort zone multiple times to appease him only for him to still be mad. At that point we were really going at it like I probably looked insane to the other people on the freeway fucking screaming into the receiver and ugly crying. 

Anyways that’s when he drops the worst possible sentence. In response to me telling him that he has no idea how shitty the position he put my brother and I in for life he goes “why do you think I drink xmynamex? because of all the fucking guilt you have put on me all these years.” and that’s when I actually was done. He has told me on multiple occasions I “saved” his life. I was the one that involved are extended family because his wife told me not to and under her care only he relapsed like 5 times (don’t even really believe he’s sober rn) (and also not fully blaming her for his relapse only blaming her not not letting anyone else know for so long) and she also verbally berated him otp with me, who knows what she says to him in person. I can say that I can understand being frustrated while living with someone that has an addiction and how that will make you say mean stuff  but that’s about the only grace I will give her. She was upset that are most recent family trip was a dry weekend in support of my dad. She’s done countless other things that I can’t even began to explain how frustrating it is that he credits her with “starting this whole thing” and by starting it she texted me on two separate occasions and we NEVER TEXT like those maybe have been the only texts we have ever sent to eachother but she texted to let me know he was driving drunk /sneaking alcohol and that she couldn’t deal with it and then I HAD TO GET THE ball rolling while trying to explain to a grown woman how alcoholism can make you lie because she was furious with my dad for lying and rapid fire texting me about that while i’m asking her if he’s currently drunk driving because if so let’s stop that first omg. I’m sorry if I explained this bad but now I basically I don’t know  how to talk to my dad. I have not spoken to him since like after he said that I told him I didn’t want to talk to him , I didn’t know when I would and I didn’t want to see him and hung up because I was too upset to even think of anything better to say. My bf now like hates my dad, my family ,friends everyone is telling me to not talk to him for a while. I just have no idea what to do. We used to fight a lot like this when I was a teenager and actually had more self confidence then and more savageness because I would straight up ban her from coming to anything I would be at/refused to talk to her or do anything.

1fzlxgi,https://i.redd.it/bx8zurcbootd1.jpeg,Will my animated logo work for both online and offline media? ,"Online or Offline—Your Logo Can Do It All!
Let’s face it, folks: the world is a circus, and your logo? It’s the clown juggling on a unicycle! But can it juggle online and offline media at the same time? Absolutely! Think of your animated logo as the ultimate wingman—it knows how to work the room, whether it’s in the wild west of the internet or the good old offline world. The real question is: are you ready to let it steal the show?


---

Two Worlds, One Logo!
Imagine your animated logo strutting its stuff on a website, doing a little dance, grabbing attention like it’s the star of a TikTok video. But then it hops off the screen, winks, and shows up on a billboard like, “I’m ready for my close-up!” Your animated logo isn’t just a one-trick pony; it’s a double agent in the branding world! It can seamlessly transition from a digital landscape to a physical one, like a chameleon on a rainbow. Who knew logos could be so versatile?


---

The Magic of Adaptability!
Here’s a fun fact: animated logos are like Swiss Army knives for your brand! They adapt to any situation, whether it’s a flashy online ad or a sleek print brochure. Want to showcase your animated logo at a trade show? Easy peasy! It can roll out on a big screen, captivating the audience like it’s performing at the Oscars. Just picture it: your logo walking down the red carpet, wearing sunglasses, and soaking up the limelight!


---

Consistency is Key!
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Will my animated logo look good in both formats?” Trust me, it’s like getting your hair done for a big date—you want to look great in every light! The key is consistency. Make sure your animated logo has the same vibe, colors, and energy whether it’s bouncing around on your website or making a grand entrance on a business card. After all, you wouldn’t want your logo to show up in flip-flops at a black-tie event, right?


---

A Unifying Force!
Think of your animated logo as the glue holding your brand together. It brings unity to your online and offline presence, creating a cohesive brand identity. Whether someone sees your logo in a flashy online ad or on a coffee mug in a cozy café, it’s like a warm hug saying, “Hey, you’re in the right place!” Your logo becomes that friendly face people recognize, no matter where they encounter it. Kind of like the favorite uncle at family gatherings—always there, always fun!


---

Get Creative with Animation!
And let’s not forget the fun part: the animation! You can get as creative as you want. Have your logo morph into a different shape or throw in some exciting effects. Just make sure it’s not so over-the-top that it scares people away! You don’t want it to look like it’s auditioning for a circus act—keep it classy! But a little flair? Absolutely! After all, your animated logo should feel like a party for your brand, not a funeral!


---

Final Thoughts: A Logo for All Seasons!
So, can your animated logo work for both online and offline media? You betcha! It’s a powerhouse that can adapt, engage, and tell your brand’s story in every setting. With a little creativity and consistency, your logo will be the life of the party, whether it’s in a digital realm or the real world. So let your animated logo shine—it’s time for it to take center stage!

I got tickets just now to go to this concert in Charlotte next year and I'm trying to get Sam to come with me cause my other (let's call him Paxton) Paxton isn't willing to come down claiming that air fares are so expensive. Paxton is wanting me to come up to Indianapolis in February and I can't for two reason. It is too soon and I can't afford it on my own and two I already have possible plans already. I'm supposed to be going with my family to go see someone potentially and so I need to keep my schedule open for that whenever my lady friend is available. Paxton isn't being understanding that Charlotte would be better for me. I'm trying to ask Sam to go as Sam is more pleasant to travel with. Sam understood my needs and he most of the time funded the entire trip. Sam and I would have an agreement where I would buy the plane ticket and he covered gas and lodging expenses so Sam was very reasonable and fair. Paxton on the other hand charges me for half of everything and so I owe Paxton $800 now. I'm upset at him so I'm not planning on paying him back. I want Sam to go with me as he was more understanding and I miss traveling with him. He was so much easier and pleasant. I tried asking Sam and he said that he has to ask his wife for permission and see if we could do this. I'm so sick of him asking his witch wife (we will call her Audrey) for everything that he wants to do. I mean its like he literally can't leave her for a fricking day. I'm supposed to see him soon next week as I'm going to Birmingham to visit him and I'm going to have a talk with him. I'm going to tell him that he needs to stop asking her for permission and that he can make his own decisions. Many married men take guys trips with their friends so I don't get why he can't just do that. I'm already ticked with him canceling florida with me and I now have no way of doing it as no one wants to go with florida. I'm going to have a talk with him in permission and say that he better do it as I'm tired of it and that he doesn't want to regret getting me mad. I already know the coffee shop in Birmingham where Audrey works so he shouldn't make me have to come there and have a girl talk with her. I got nice bricks at my house that I can use. I am planning on telling him that he should just quit asking her and just come over for the concert for the weekend.

1fzlkzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fzlkzn/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_is_constantly_shooting_down/,My (M20) girlfriend (F19) is constantly shooting down my advances. How do I get her spark back?,"My girlfriend and I have been with each other for nearly a year, our anniversary being next month.  We are both college students and we’re practically living together in apartment style housing. But our bedroom life is dying, so how can I get her to want me again?

I am her first real boyfriend, as well as her first sexual partner. First kiss, first everything. However, unfortunately I had a rather promiscuous life starting at a young age so I am rather experienced.

I think for the most part we have a very healthy and promising relationship and any other past relationship I’ve had pales in comparison. I love her very dearly and I’ve been around enough to know that this is different. Her family holds me in a very high regard, and love having me around. Vice versa for her with my family.

I love caring for her. I’m constantly showering her in kisses, and constantly affirming my love for her as well as plenty of compliments. I also love making her coffee, delicious breakfast and dinner meals. I even try and make regular nights special with my measly college bank account by ordering our favorite sushi place, etc. to watch our favorite show to binge at the time. Whether it is for her birthday, Christmas, valentines, etc. I always plan out a very thoughtful gift that I know she will love, including expensive jewelry and flowers.

I also know this is just how I feel toward her normally because I know it’s not the honeymoon phase. I know how that feels. 

Anyways, when we first met, we were going at it for 3-4 times a day, everyday, for nearly an entire month. There were multiple times where I’ve even had to decline her because I was so exhausted from the previous times. She would jump on my bones constantly. 

Despite that we were also not together yet. I’ll admit, I was a pretty ginormous asshole sleeping with multiple women and constantly drinking and other things I’ll refrain to say, but she was very aware of all of this.

This sort of situationship lasted for 2 months before I began to have romantic feelings for her and we began to officially date. Though I refrain of speaking of this time with her, she has admitted that she loved me much earlier and convinced herself to pretend we were dating anyways, which is why she stuck around.

Post officially dating we went from 3-4 times a day to 2-3 times a day. Usually in the morning, sometimes around noon, and before we went to sleep. Then sometime down the line it went to 1-2 times a day. And then recently the last couple of months it’s been maybe once every 2-3 days.

It’s getting to the point where she is constantly shooting down any of my advances, probably like 80% of the time and it honestly sucks. And no, i’m not asking literally every other hour. Sometimes in the morning I try something but it’s usually always at night before we go to sleep. I obviously don’t feel annoyed but I do feel let down. Sometimes I accidentally let it slip on my face the disappointment. 

It occurred to me that suddenly, I was the only one ever trying to initiate for a very long while. And it’s been bothering me. I want to feel desired, to feel wanted, but this need of mine hasn’t been fulfilled in a long time. 

I’ve noticed that maybe I’ve been starting to feel some level of resentment so I tried to talk to her about it. At first it was healthy, she explained that she feels insecure often, mentioned how the birth control could be lowering her libido, and often shrinks because she doesn’t feel up to par with my previous partners as she believes she’s inexperienced. 

Internally, I may have minimized her reasoning as I can’t imagine her being insecure about herself (she’s gorgeous and I constantly remind her of that), and I doubted the birth control can be affecting her to this degree. As for the previous partners, I’ve told her that they can’t compare to how great she is.

Alas, the conversation had to end as I had to leave for class. Although class I had intended to visit a female friend of mine, of which she is also friends with my girlfriend, and is also in her own relationship. I had told my girlfriend of these plans the day before, though I doubled checked if it was okay just before I went.

This triggered an argument as she accused me of emotionally cheating, under the assumption that I was going to talk to our mutual friend about our sex-life issues. Various things were said on both sides that neither of us appreciated however we were able to reconcile and move on. 

However, nothing has changed. I’m still being shot down constantly and I feel like our intimate physical connection is very weak. I’m constantly winded up with no outlet, so I’m having to sneak off to relieve myself and it’s leaving me very sour.

Tonight I was turned down for the last time, as I am freezing her out until she starts to initiate more. Not to say that I won’t be warm and loving to her, but I will just no longer initiate physical touch anymore. 

I refuse to be in a relationship with a dead bedroom, so i’m trying to fix this now before it’s worse.",0,1728457470.0,relationship_advice,11,0.5,False

I signed up for the “wealthy women vault” because I wanted to find out what sort of BS Rakel was going to be sharing in her “class” (that is supposedly worth $222 🤣) and expose her here! I didn’t use her link to sign up because I wanted to make sure that I was not directly contributing to her personal commissions in case there was such a thing. Consider this my contribution to this community and I hope that more and more people wake up to the grifter that yoga girl really is.

So to start off, here is a recap of the money podcast that she released shortly before the vault went live (just in case you didn’t listen to it or you didn’t read my podcast recap previously). So this is what she said about the vault in that podcast episode:

“All of this to say that I am doing my first speaking engagement in a very long time whereI’m going to be sharing my own deeper lessons that I have learned about money running my yoga girl business. I’m going to share how I went from an 18-year-old living in the Caribbean, to generating enough income to start and grow my business, hiring employees, buying a piece of land and building a studio. creating everything that we created, only to realize that that definition of success doesn’t actually align with who I am. The event is called “wealthy woman vault” and it’s for anyone who is having this realization that living paycheck to paycheck just doesn’t work anymore. I was originally only wanting to attend this conference, because I myself want to learn what these incredible people know about money, but I ended up being offered a speaking position - and at first, I was like, “but I don’t know anything about money!” But then I realized that actually I DO have a lot to add, especially in the realm of manifesting abundance.  So I’ll be sharing some deeper insights and never before shared stories about my journey. I’d love for you to join me.”

So I was very curious to know: what are the deeper lessons that she has learned in her money journey? how did she create this thriving yoga business? What are the deeper insights and never before shared stories about her journey? let’s find out! 

 So Katya starts off by talking about the 4 archetypes (poverty, feast and famine, overachieving, and relaxed wealth) and she asks Rachel which ones she resonates with the most. Rachel says definitely the overachieving archetype. She feels like she is only now starting to enter the relaxed wealth cycle. She says that before it may have looked like she was more successful from the outside, but on the inside she was killing herself and that she felt like she couldn’t slow the train down for one second because she would lose it all. “It’s so engrained and ancestral. Everyone has had to hustle in the past and weren’t able to just relax. It was never an option. But that’s what I want and I am worthy of that, and I can feel things shifting and changing.”

They then go back to the beginning of Rachel’s “Yoga Girl” story. Katya says that she has always admired how Rachel could go on tour and have sold out yoga classes with 1,000 participants. “How are you doing this? Holding space for so many people and keep your heart so open. What was happening behind the scenes for you during that time?” Rachel says that ancestrally she resonates with the feast and famine archetype. She grew up in an interesting dynamic where she had a single mom of 4 kids who was killing herself to make ends meet and was always struggling to hold it together and to pay the bills. “Then there was my dad who I would see on weekends and go on vacations with him who was very very wealthy and successful. So I had one foot in each world. On this side, we never had enough, we weren’t allowed to waste or spend. And on the other side there was so much, there was an overflow of wealth and resources that was not used in a healthy way. I could see that even when I was very young. Growing up I was always working odd jobs: babysitting, waitressing, working in a grocery store and a dive shop. I always had this idea that money would disappear but it’s ok because all of a sudden it will come again. So when I was living in Costa Rica I sometimes had to choose if I was going to feed my dog or feed myself. But I never felt panic because things had always come easy to me. And when I started teaching yoga it came with an automatic feeling of “if I make too much money, I have to give it away.” I’m supposed to feel content with just enough with my head above water. But wanting more than that felt shameful. And I realize now that I entered a rocket ship career in the yoga industry where I felt the desire to create something really big but I’m not supposed to hold on to any of the abundance that I receive. And believe it or not, having hosted yoga classes with 1,000 students, I am not able to tell you how much money such a class generates. I have never looked once! I don’t know. I paid someone to do my books. I had a thriving business, teaching classes, leading retreats, doing my podcast, selling products and books. I did so much but I was never interested in the money side of things. I never asked “hey how are things going? How much are we making? How much are we spending? How much is everyone getting paid? Is this sustainable?” I never looked under the hood because it came from a place of not believing that any of it was meant for me. I didn’t run my business to get rich or to sell. I just wanted to be of service to the community. And now I wish I had done things differently and allowed myself to hold on to the money that was coming in. let’s make this into something that will have legs forever. Let’s make a bunch of money! Not once did I have that mindset.. and now I wish I had had more time to achieve that.”

“I’m going to turn 36 next month and I know nothing about how to invest my money but I have run a multi million dollar business. Isn’t that so wild? I grew up with a father who is so good at all of this. when I was 16 he gave my brother and I each $3,000 and said we could choose what to do with it. He gave us the option to either invest it in the stock market and open a portfolio and he would even show us how to do it, or, he said “you can have it in your hand and then you are in charge of it.” My brother said “stock portfolio please!” and I said “Cash please!” and I spent the money partying and buying boots. And I wonder why didn’t I have the interest? is it a personality thing? But I also remember my dad talking to my brother about money in a different way because there was this belief that finances is not for girls.. it’s not important for us. And I lost it all so quickly, whereas my brother invested really wisely and when he graduated high school he had a nice little treasure chest that he could do whatever he wanted with, while I had nothing left and had to borrow money from him.”

“I’m now teaching my daughter how to make money and that it’s ok to hang on to it and that we don’t have to give it all away. I think there is a difference between being of service because it’s our calling and we want to have more than enough so it can overflow to other people, versus not wanting to hold on to what we generate because we feel shame around it, and because we feel we are not worthy of having that kind of abundance. I had so many beautiful community initiatives and non-profit organizations but it came from a place of “omg there is too much money coming in. Give it away to people because I don’t know what to do with it.” Instead of from a place of integrity and calm AFTER having built something that can live on for a long time. I did it all at the same time. I started my business and then immediately launched a non-profit to give it all away.”

“I feel that money is a feminine energy. it’s not this patriarchal, male energy of hustling and grinding your way to wealth. We all had this modelled to us from the male figures in our families. I always believed that you have to have the qualities of a man to make money. Tough, strong, and ruthless, and you keep going and never stop, and it’s all been a lie that the system has been feeding us because it feeds the 1%, and the white men. But now I am learning that I can have a business and make money from a more relaxed and calm place. That I can lean into the feminine and not have to kill myself the way I used to do before. And it’s a much more pleasurable place to be in. if we were all able to lean into this soft feminine place we would all be better people, better mothers, better friends versus when we are all fighting for our lives.”

They bring up the topic of hiring in their businesses and I’m not going to elaborate too much because it’s not super important but what stands out to me here is Rachel saying that her first hire was an assistant who did everything from answering island yoga customer service emails to walking their dogs! I wonder how much she paid this person. Then Katya says that it’s so easy to hire someone from the Philippines for $7 an hour. These two things show me that these 2 women are not afraid of exploiting others to further their own business.

Rachel then goes into the time of Lea’s birth, how she planned to go back to work right away and that she would bring the baby to the studio and fit motherhood around her business rather than the other way around. But then when Lea was born she realized all she wanted to do was disappear. “I didn’t want to teach, I didn’t want to host retreats. But there was nothing I could do at that point. I had a retreat booked with 60 people flying in. I couldn’t just suddenly tell everyone “hey guys I had a baby and I don’t really feel like teaching anymore.” So I had the first retreat when she was only 4 weeks old, and then again at 4 months, 6 months, and back to back retreats and a teacher training when she was 7 months old. And in the middle of that, women’s health magazine called and wanted me to be on the cover of their magazine. I knew it was going to kill me but my ego was too big and I couldn’t say no. So in the middle of the teacher training I flew to LA for 36 hours to do the shoot. And it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I was made to feel unworthy because I hadn’t lost my baby weight. I cried on my way there, cried during the shoot, and cried on the way home. That was when I realized I have to slow down and ask for more support.”

Then Katya asks her how she grew her account to 2 million followers and Rachel says “I think the difference with me is that I really care. I care deeply about my followers. I got a message from someone who was very upset 2 days ago. She sent me a LOOONG message about this money thing I was sharing about. I noticed that she had been writing me since 2015 and it was all positive. She seems like a sweet girl. But this message she said “You have changed so much. I can’t believe you’re on the podcast talking about money. And wanting to make more when you already have so much. Here I am wanting a better life for myself but I cannot afford a lot of things.” She was very triggered and that in turn triggered me because of my money shame. So I sent her back a voice message. I do this often. I will respond to my followers via voice notes or sometimes I even call them if they have the option activated. And I talk to them for up to 20 minutes validating how they are feeling and that I can see where they are coming from. I hold space for them and thank them for being a follower and tell them that I understand if they decide to unfollow. I do this throughout the day because I really care. I don’t see this community as people that I can pitch to or sell to, or push them to buy more shit. I’m not even selling anything right now. I’m not teaching, I’m not hosting retreats. I’m not trying to get them to come to my studio. I’m just here. and 9 times out of 10 when I try to authentically interact with them I get a connection back and the person feels seen and is now more engaged with my page. Is it really a community when it’s just strangers that you’ve never interacted with and are just selling a bunch of to? So this girl that I mentioned here ended up messaging me back apologizing for her message and she said that she was just very triggered and she wishes she could take it back. And also something that I ask myself a lot is “Would I be sitting here with 2 million followers if I wasn’t a thin, white, blond girl from Sweden?”

And finally, Katya asks her about how the conversations about money are at home between her and Dennis and how it has evolved through the years? And she doesn’t really answer the question. She says “Dennis has a bachelor in finance or business management or something like that.. so when we were a smaller operation he was always the one taking care of the finance side of things. And then when we grew bigger he has always managed something. At the studio, or logistics, or producing and filming. And now we have several businesses. He opened a coffee roastery. And it’s beautiful watching him stepping into his own financial independence doing his own thing. But we just sold our studio and for the first time in our lives we are sitting on big chunk of money. But Dennis comes from a single mom household and comes from the poor part of Aruba. Growing up he had to hitch hike to get to school. His whole life he was just content if he had enough money to surf. That was always his goal. And he is still very much that guy. Whereas I am thinking about buying land and how can we pass a legacy on to our children? How can we invest in crypto or gold bars?”

And then she ends by talking about what the bees have taught her about abundance and promotes her podcast. 

So there you have it! those are Miss Ancestral’s very informative, very valuable, very insightful money lessons. I think it’s safe to say that this class has taught people absolutely nothing! it’s just more of her talking about herself (which she LOVES doing) and she doesn’t have anything tangible to teach anyone. how on earth she was even considered for this event is beyond me. And considering that all the “teacher” that participated are grifters and scammers, that is saying a lot - because some of them do have some tangible things to teach in their classes, but Rachel offers absolutely nothing of value! anyway, I hope you enjoyed reading this! I would love to talk hear your thoughts about this whole thing in the comments 👇🏻

The comments said she probably likes me so I was gonna ask her out at some point this week. However, when we ate dinner together (with our friends), her friends mentioned that she went to a coffee shop and studied with some other guy, and they seemed to think that there was something romantic between them. When her friends mentioned it, they seemed like they were really grilling her on what happened. They were speaking another language so I couldn't tell and they only briefly explained afterwards. My crush said in response that they only just studied but it doesn't change the fact that she went alone with another dude. 

I knew she was going, because I met the dude together with her and her friend the other day and he invited them. I thought it would be fine because the dude was really nice and he was inviting out both of them. My crush also seemed to want me to come with her but I had class during that period so I couldn't, so they ended up going alone, just the two of them. 

It sounds fine but I don't know what my crush was saying to her friends. I couldn't tell whether or not she actually likes the guy or not, but considering how her friends were acting it makes me think that it could definitely be possible that she likes that dude instead, or is at least interested in him. Also, the fact that her friends didn't seem to even consider that I am also a straight guy and that I might like her is a bit concerning, because that might mean that she doesn't see me in that way at all.

1fzlecm,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1fzlecm/school_should_focus_on_academic_success_and/,"School should focus on academic success and passing examination. Skill such as cookery, dress making and woodwork should not be taught at school as it it better to learn from friend and family. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that educational institutions should only emphasize on academic achievement and passing examinations. Therefore, skills such as dress making, cookery, carpentry are not required to be taught at school as it is more effective to learn these from family and friends. I strongly disagree with this notion because schools are better equipped with facilities to teach these skills and, can also provide more professionals who can easily guide these children.

The primary reason for my disagreement is because school have more effective facilities to learn these skills compared to others. This is because families and friends will generally teach these skills in their own house which does not have the required equipments. However, schools are meant to be a place to fully teach these skills to the students and make them advanced. Therefore, they have organized several features which will assist their learning process. For instance, in many schools, they have organized a separate class for cookery, and have installed equipments such as coffee machine, burner which are more practical for juveniles to master cookery.

Moreover, schools have more professional teachers who can guide children better than their friends or families. Schools have many advanced and highly-educated professors who specialise in teaching people necessary skills in their lives. That is because these teachers have spent many years to learn these skills first, to be able to these others. As a result, they can provide more detailed guidance then friends and family who usually are not sufficiently well-trained. For example, a mentor has to spend minimum 4 years studying dress making in their undergraduate years before being qualified to teach in primary schools.

In conclusion, I firmly disagree that educational institutions should only concentrate on academic success and passing examinations and should neglect teaching skills because, school contains more effective facilities that can easily teach other children skills, and they have more professional mentors then unexperienced friends and families.",1,1728456636.0,IELTS,3,1.0,False

I know for the both of us it was the most intense relationship we had both had, and we were a very popular couple. I think other people liked how in love we were and liked being around us. We never really 'broke up' because it was too hard, he just went travelling 18 months in and we did a sort of will we won't we until we both moved on. Actually, during our will we won't we (get back together) dance, we met our current partners on the exact same day. I think Jung would say he was my animus.

We broke up for several reasons mostly pertaining to not having sex anymore and the agitation and worry that causes in a relationship. Since we broke up I've come to realise a lot of that was probably my being on birth control (which I went on because we got pregnant and had an abortion together, which I have come to regret). Since coming off birth control three months ago, two years post break up, I think about him non stop.

We tried to maintain a friendship and did for some time but it became tense when he started dating his current partner over a year ago and blew up totally a few months ago when he saw a tweet I made about an ex being a bad gift giver (I had no idea he still used twitter). When we would catch up I tried to speak of my current partner in positives that weren't drawing a comparison between the two of them (he's really lovely, he treats me well etc.) but he spoke of his new GF as 'the love of my life, I have never treated someone this well before, I have never felt this way about someone before she's the one etc.' I want to stress that I knew this was sort of BS (I'm sure he loves her but the need for comparison and for me to know it seemed intentional just to get back at me, he was the one who always wanted to get back together and I rejected him. One of the reasons I knew it was bullshit was because he said they were both 'the same person' and the example he gave was that they're both loud.... so yeah).

I haven't spoken to him in months since apologising for the tweet which again I had no idea he'd see. I feel very divided because I love my current boyfriend and he truly is a beautiful lovely person that loves me as well so much, but I don't feel this crazy connection to him like I did my ex. I also feel confused because I felt like I was over my ex for a long time and only started thinking about him again now that I haven't seen him for close to a year. Am I just imagining him being better than he was?

I feel like I never properly mourned this insane formative relationship that fundamentally changed both our lives and just tried to move on as quickly as possible because it hurt so much. I've been thinking that it would be good to see him to feel like I'm properly over him, like a reminder. I think the chat could make me happier in my current relationship, and fully ready to let that relationship go, but I don't know if he'll be willing to see me (since last year his GF hasn't let him see me at all). Should I ask him for a coffee for final closure? I just want to know if I'm actually still in love with him (blow up my current relationship and deal with the consequences) or if I'm imagining things, and just need some apologies for things he did and we did and to just move on.",1,1728456525.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1fzlcfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Real_Button_2421/comments/1fzlcfp/quantum_attraction/,"Quantum Attraction
","I first saw her in the college library, her nose buried in a thick book, glasses perched on her nose. She was the kind of girl who made me forget my own name. Long, wavy chestnut hair, fair skin with a smattering of freckles across her nose, and a figure that made my mouth water. I was smitten.

""Excuse me, do you know where I can find the section on quantum physics?"" I asked, leaning over her shoulder. She looked up, her hazel eyes meeting mine, and I was a goner.

""Hi, I'm Jamie,"" she said, extending a hand. ""And you are?""

""I'm Eli,"" I replied, taking her hand. ""Nice to meet you, Jamie.""

We spent the next hour talking about everything and nothing, our hands brushing, our eyes locked. She was a freshman, I was a senior, but that didn't seem to matter. There was an undeniable spark between us.

""Would you like to grab coffee sometime?"" I asked, hoping I didn't sound too eager.

She smiled, ""I'd like that, Eli.""

Our first date was at a quiet café downtown. We talked, laughed, and flirted shamelessly. I could tell she was as attracted to me as I was to her. Our hands found each other under the table, fingers intertwining.

""You know,"" she said, her voice low, ""I think we've been playing it safe for too long.""

She leaned in, her lips parting slightly, and I met her halfway. Our kiss was deep and passionate, our tongues exploring each other's mouths. I groaned, pulling her closer, my hand cupping her cheek.

""Let's get out of here,"" I whispered against her lips.

Back at my place, she straddled me on the couch, her hands in my hair. Our kiss deepened, our bodies pressing together. I unbuttoned her blouse, revealing her lacy bra. She arched her back, pushing her breasts into my hands. I took one nipple into my mouth, sucking and licking, then biting gently. She moaned, her hips grinding against me.

""Eli,"" she gasped, ""I want you so much.""

I unhooked her bra, freeing her gorgeous breasts. I licked and pinched her nipples, making her squirm. She unzipped my pants, her hand wrapping around my cock. I groaned, feeling her stroke me.

""Fuck, Jamie,"" I growled, ""You're driving me crazy.""

She smiled, her eyes dark with desire. ""Good,"" she said, climbing off me. She stood up, shimmying out of her skirt and panties. I admired her naked body, her curves driving me wild.

I stood up, pushing my pants down. My cock was rock hard, throbbing with need. She looked at it, licking her lips. ""I want to taste you,"" she said, dropping to her knees.

She took me into her mouth, her tongue swirling around the head. I threw my head back, a groan escaping me. She sucked and licked, her hand stroking my shaft. I felt my orgasm building, but I didn't want to come in her mouth just yet.

""Jamie,"" I gasped, ""I need to be inside you.""

She looked up at me, her lips glistening with my precum. She stood up, turning around and bending over the couch. I positioned myself behind her, my cock poised at her entrance. I slid in slowly, feeling her wet heat surrounding me.

""Oh, God,"" she moaned, ""You feel so good.""

I started to thrust, my hips slapping against her ass. I reached around, finding her clit with my thumb. She gasped, her body tensing. I rubbed her clit in time with my thrusts, her moans filling the room.

""Harder, Eli,"" she begged, ""Fuck me harder.""

I obliged, my thrusts becoming faster, deeper. Our bodies slapped together, the sounds of our sex filling the air. I could feel my orgasm building, my cock throbbing.

""I'm close, Jamie,"" I panted, ""I'm going to come.""

""Yes,"" she moaned, ""Come inside me, Eli. Fill me up.""

With a final thrust, I came, my cock pulsing as I filled her with my cum. She moaned, her body convulsing as she came with me.

We collapsed onto the couch, our bodies slick with sweat. I pulled her close, our hearts beating in sync.

""That was... incredible,"" she said, her voice breathless.

I smiled, kissing her softly. ""It was, Jamie. It really was.""

1fzlayy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCare/comments/1fzlayy/daily_coffee_grinder_cleaning/,Daily Coffee Grinder Cleaning,"Cleaning your coffee grinder every day is essential for maintaining the best flavor in your coffee and ensuring your equipment runs smoothly. After following a simple routine, I’ve found it’s an easy way to keep everything in top condition without any headaches. Let me walk you through my daily grinder cleaning process:

#### Step 1: Closing the Hopper Gate and Purging Coffee
The first thing I do is close the hopper gate to prevent any beans from spilling out. Then, I purge all the coffee grounds left in the chamber. Depending on your grinder, this might take a couple of doses (usually two to four). Once that’s done, I toss the old grounds into the compost bin.

#### Step 2: Removing and Storing the Beans
Next, I remove the hopper, keeping the gate closed so the beans don’t spill all over the floor (we’ve all been there!). The beans are stored in an airtight, food-safe container overnight to keep them fresh.

#### Step 3: Using Grinds to Clean the Burrs
Here’s a little trick I love: using grind cleaner pellets, which help remove residual coffee oils from the burrs without needing to take apart the grinder. I run about 35 grams of these pellets (roughly one flat cap) through the grinder. These pellets are food-safe, gluten-free, vegan, and even compostable.

#### Step 4: Cleaning the Hopper with Steam
I steam the hopper using the steam wand from my espresso machine, but first, I purge the steam wand to make sure it’s clean. I gently steam the inside of the hopper without getting the plastic too hot. Afterward, I wipe down the hopper with a clean microfiber cloth, polishing both the interior and exterior.

#### Step 5: Vacuuming the Grinder
I use a shop vac to clean out any loose grounds at the top of the grinder where the burrs are, as well as up into the chute. It’s crucial to never put your fingers near the burrs when they’re exposed—if you need to dislodge something or do a deep clean, always make sure the grinder is unplugged from any electrical source.

#### Step 6: Checking and Cleaning the Chute
Once the hopper is back on, I check the control panel and look into the chute for any loose coffee grounds. I use a paintbrush to sweep them out and wipe away any coffee oil buildup with my microfiber cloth. It’s important to only clean down into the chute and never up into the grinder, where the coffee comes through, to avoid damaging any components like the distributor or declumper.

#### Step 7: Polishing the Exterior
Lastly, I give the exterior of the grinder a quick clean. A paintbrush helps sweep away any loose grounds, and a microfiber cloth with a little dab of cleaner makes the grinder look polished and new.

#### Why Daily Cleaning Matters
There are three main reasons I clean my grinder daily:
1. **Flavor**: It keeps my coffee tasting fresh and prevents any off-flavors from old grounds or coffee oils.
2. **Consistency**: A clean grinder runs more smoothly, ensuring consistent grind sizes and shot timings.
3. **Longevity**: Regular cleaning helps my grinder last longer, which is especially important since grinders are such a crucial (and expensive!) piece of equipment.

This routine doesn’t just apply to my espresso grinder—I also use it for my filter grinder (an EK43), following almost the same steps. The only difference is I adjust the grind setting to the coarsest option when running the cleaner pellets through.

With a little bit of daily care, my grinder stays in top shape, and I never have to deal with excessive buildup or time-consuming deep cleans. Keeping up with this routine ensures that I always have great-tasting coffee and a grinder that runs like a dream!",1,1728456204.0,ProductCare,0,1.0,False

I really need some advice or an outside perspective on what to do. ,"My boyfriend (21 M) has been lying to me (20 F) about drinking, even after many talks. I'm losing trust in him, but I truly love him so much and I want us to fix this. But I need outside perspective. What do I do?

TLDR: Boyfriend has been drinking and lying about it a bunch, but because of our pasts I want to help him through it, though my patience and trust are waning. 

I'm 20F, he's 21M. I swear he is the love of my life. From the literal moment we met it's seemed like some shit out of a Disney movie. But we've only been together for about a year and a half, and this issue is the biggest we've faced, and I don't know what to do about it. We both have trauma around our parents being alcoholics, but I never touched alcohol, whereas he fell hard into it. He lied his whole life just to survive, whereas I was lucky enough to have friends help me out of my situation. I now live with him and his parents who have gone to rehab and turned their lives around (which is so amazing of them, his mom is currently in college to become an addiction counselor). I can't live with my parents, my alcoholic father kicked me out and my mom lives with a pedophile and has severe mental health problems. 

When he turned 21 he drank a lot. I figured, hell yeah, he's 21, do ya thing, but it started to become too much. He drank every day for about a week, and I told him it was starting to affect me because of my past with people in my life drinking a bunch. He was a bit defensive at first, and through talking about it, we discerned it was definitely an addiction that he was trying to defend. He promised he wouldn't drink as much any more, but the *next* fucking day, he goes to a concert he was planning on going to and when the concert is over I call him a bunch because it's hours after the show ended and I'm fucking panicking, and he stumbles inside completely hammered. He drove himself all the way through the city, *super* drunk. He comes home crying and saying he's super sorry, that he has no impulse control. He also has severe diagnosed ADHD, and he says that it is one of the reasons he has no impulse control, but I am sceptical he is using it as an excuse. From then, it was no more drinking. 

I’ll make a small list of times he’s drank after that:

-Peer pressured by his grandpa, tried to lie about not being drunk

-Peer pressured by his grandpa, cried when he got home

-When we were housesitting for my friend’s family who let me live with them for a while. While I was at an appointment he drank, fell asleep, and pissed the couch

-Yesterday, didn’t say anything and lied saying his breath smelled acidic because of coffee

-Today. I came home from my class and there were paper towels on the ground. I asked what happened and he said the dog peed. He’s never done that before. The room smelled of vomit and he lit candles to try to cover up the smell. I asked why it smelled like vomit and he said it’s the smell of the carpet cleaner. I went to hang out with my friend after that. He asked for money to buy some coffee. I think he used my fucking money to buy himself alcohol. I came home from hanging with my friend and tried waking him up. He was clearly super drunk. We were planning on having a date today. I’ve just been on my computer all day trying to ignore him in my peripheral vision, but he’s fallen off the bed, then took off his pants, and is back on the bed, on top of all our clean clothes, half-naked. 

Talking to his mom about it would be difficult. She is the source of most of his trauma, and even though she has turned her life around and is a very fun person, she is apparently diagnosed with NPD, and would not take responsibility. 

I don’t want to break up with him. One, I love him literally more than anything. Here, I am only explaining the bad so he probably sounds horrible, but he really is my best friend, and I’m certain I would never be able to find someone more perfect for me than him, even with this whole thing. Two, I have nowhere else to live. I’m in college so I can’t work full time and I live in one of the most horrible places in the United States in terms of housing prices. 

Do I just have to be patient? How many “I need you to be honest with me” conversations can I handle?

My parents are both highly educated (and also not American, they’ve just aligned themselves with Trump) and they also come out with the most incomprehensible things. Worse, disagreeing with them has actually given my cPTSD (it wasn’t the only cause, but one of many) as I was shouted at for disagreeing, called demonic by my mum for coming out as a trans woman (after my dad promised home would be a ‘safe space’ for me), told i was committing suicide and advocating for genocide by supporting the covid vaccine, that I was anti-intellectual for believing in evolution over creationism, had my mum break down in tears and cry because I wore a shirt with flowers. I’ve been transitioning secretly (HRT) for 5 years and never told them, because I can’t trust them. I came out to them, and while my dad was supportive my mum… I don’t want to go into what she said, but I nearly had to ring an ambulance because I had such a severe panic attack I could no longer breathe.

It’s just so hard to process what to do or say. I have selective mutism and I can’t speak when I am stressed or overwhelmed. I just find the things they tell me so shocking and idiotic, but even when I’ve managed to correct them or educate them, it all gets undone the moment a right wing influencer tells them something different. 

I can’t move out (my support needs are relatively high), and I can’t speak up so I just sit there quietly and try to not process what they’re saying. It’s not worth dedicating resources to debunk or argue against. It’s one of many factors that have been destroying my mental health, and I wonder if life is even worth it sometimes.

Most of the time, I’ll only be brewing coffee for my girlfriend and me. I understand that both models can handle this, but the Select is fully automated.

Honestly, I’m not interested in minor advantages if they make the machine less convenient or significantly more expensive. If blooming makes a meaningful difference to the brew (not just a slight 5% improvement), then I’ll take it into consideration. Otherwise, I don’t see it as a critical factor.

At these price points, which model would you recommend?

Also, I’m considering the Wilfa Svart grinder instead of the Baratza Encore ESP to save costs. Any thoughts on this?",1,1728454882.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False
1fzl01s,https://www.reddit.com/r/joannfabrics/comments/1fzl01s/advice_on_possibly_filing_an_hr_complaint/,Advice on possibly filing an HR complaint,"So my store recently got a new sm in July and quite honestly I wish we never got her at all. Our stock room has been absolutely jam packed, our store looks the absolute worst I’ve ever seen it (fabric spilling out of boxes scattered all over the aisles), and multiple employees quitting/actively looking elsewhere for jobs. While my previous sm treated me like actual crap my current one does things like not tell you to do things and get mad that you don’t do them and will find even the smallest of things to fuss you for. I got yelled at for getting a drink from a coffee shop on the way to work because I’m “not ready to work” when I have one apparently. 

There are shifts where I am opening or closing and as an ic I don’t even know if I’m supposed to be doing any of that because I’ve never seen a job description in my one year in the position. I have told her multiple times now that I’m not comfortable being the mod for shifts unless it is an absolute emergency yet she keeps scheduling me as such. There was a Sunday when I was scheduled as mod open to close and got pissed at me for the system being down and for having the asm come in to help to payroll and such because I don’t know how to do it (surprise the system was down and it wasn’t done so it was also my fault). 

My sm will frequently say “a plan is in motion” or “trust the process” and then straight up not give me any details and when I ask I’m told to not ask questions that aren’t about freight. There have been times when she’s been asked about a plan and her response was that we were supposed to come up with one. 

Our long time employees are dropping like flies and we’re down to two key holders both of which have been here for less than a month. She told one of our now previous key holders that she needs to step down because they were asking the sm to take their shift because they were really sick. The other two long time employees and I are just so tired and fed up with everything that we just don’t know what to do anymore. I used to be pretty much over my general anxiety but now I’ve had the first panic attack in over 8 years because of this and I’m taking meds for it again. It doesn’t help that the sm will literally creep around corners when she hears you talking and even keeps a store radio in her truck so she can hear what we’re saying when she’s in the parking lot. 

I really like what I do I just don’t like the conditions I have to do it in. I don’t feel like I can reach out to my dm about anything because he doesn’t really concern himself with regular associates because he doesn’t know how to solve any problems. Things are getting to the point where I would like something to be done because waiting for some kind of divine intervention just won’t work. I feel like the next best thing would be to contact hr about this but I have no clue where to even start. I have the contact info just no idea what to say or what to claim anything as. I’m also severely concerned that if I do file a complain will it be anonymous? Even just conversations about what to do with her are like pulling teeth to me and I just end up crying every time. 

TLDR: my sm is terrible and I want to file an hr complaint",3,1728454828.0,joannfabrics,1,1.0,False

It was quite alarming, so I rushed outside to see what was happening. A man was beating the woman, and by the time I got there, several people had already gathered to help. They managed to intervene, beating the man and driving him away. It turned out they were a young couple from the Northeast, probably in their early twenties.

My neighbour, took the woman into her house, offering her coffee and comforting her. A few of us stayed outside to guard the house and ensure the man didn’t return. Eventually, a police complaint was filed. My neighbor also contacted a women's self-help group activist, who arrived soon after. The crowd gradually dispersed, and people went about their day and even I went back to my home.

The police arrived about half an hour later. They had the woman call her husband back, and when he showed up, the police slapped him across the face. They spoke with him for a while, and I observed the situation from my balcony. After some time, the activist, my neighbour, and the woman left together in a police jeep, presumably headed to the station. I believe the husband was arrested, but I’m not entirely sure.

Just wrote this post to convey how community plays an important role, I want to appreciate my neighbours and the people on the road today for the help they did to the woman.

1fzkyln,https://v.redd.it/3w0zup91botd1,Morning iced coffee after a long time,"Recently I got a south indian filter coffee percolator after watching a few YouTube videos. It didn’t do well with acidity (reduced it to almost nil) and over-extracted. So, I spent the last few days experimenting with grind size and water proportions and I think i have the perfect recipe and technique now!

It’s a very different texture, more similar to what you get with cold brew and now it preserves a lot of acidity and flavour of the coffee and I’m quite happy with it. Something new that I can do in the morning :)",3,1728454640.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False
