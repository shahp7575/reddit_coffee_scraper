I‚Äôve been playing Good Coffee Great Coffee for the past 4 days. It‚Äôs been going okay, a little repetitive. It gets a little frustrating to me that I bought extra ingredients but they barely ever get ordered. I‚Äôm on level 6 now and there are 3 kinds of syrup that I bought (strawberry, vanilla and chocolate) And I never ever gotten an order that requires these ingredients. I‚Äôm getting tired of making the same drinks over and over again.

1j1x9ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j1x9ax/i_21f_accidentally_started_a_relationship_with_my/,I (21F) accidentally started a relationship with my best friend (22M) only three hours after I broke up with my ex (28M).,"Hey Reddit! I (21F) started a relationship with my best friend (22M) in the weirdest way possible. 

For context, my relationship with my ex partner (28M) ended only a day prior, but had been slowly deteriorating, starting with a fully dead bedroom, lack of intimacy and in general separating ways for over a year. I had the chance to fully get over it while I was still in the relationship. I am aware that that was not the right thing to do, in retrospect, but I ended up trying and trying, until I imploded and broke up with my ex on Valentine's Day.

Now to my best friend (22M)  He's been part of my life since highschool and he got me through my SAT exams by tutoring me, after which we became great friends. Just a couple of years later, he moved across the continent just to be in my city. Since then we've become really close. I had always thought he was cute, but I never looked at him romantically up until September, when I developed a raging crush on him, a crush I had tried desperately to suppress and get rid of. We always do loads of stuff together, many activities that I always tried to get my ex to join us in, but he'd always decline. Coffee, shopping, climbing, skating, you name it. Again, my ex was always welcome and my best friend had nothing to do with the breakup. 

A couple of weeks before the breakup me and my best friend a couple of days away together, to go see a concert. It was a lovely time and we of course slept in separate beds. The closest we got to eachother was him leaning on me to watch a movie and we had never gotten that close before. After that, at the concert, he looked at me like he never had before. It was confusing but I was like ""uh oh.""

Flash forward, my break up happens, me and my ex decide that it's for the best to break it off. Three hours later I was at my best friend's flat, I had nowhere else to stay. We talked about how I felt, ordered takeout and talked like normally. The shit went down at night. One bed, one blanket. No issue. Turned away from eachother to sleep. But he said he was cold because we're sharing a blanket and needed to cuddle. I said ""sure."" Things happened and we made out for a solid 8 hours. Didn't go past that, but after that things were definitely past the point of no return. 

Then the morning came around and my best friend had a massive feeling of guilt wash over him and started crying, saying he could not do this and could not be with me. I was fully ready to lose the friendship to my own mistakes. He was weeping saying he couldn't lose me but this is wrong. Asked me to kiss him again, said it felt empty. I just kind of sat there stunned, tears in my eyes. Play with fire, get burnt, or something. I start crying but I accept the situation. I keep trying to get up and leave but he stops me every time. ""I can't live without you"" we speak about how we met and all the good times we've shared. He looks at me and says ""I cannot love without you, we have to figure this out."" He says he realized that life without me is one he couldn't live and he wants me to be with him forever and just never realized it? 

Either way, we've been living together as I search for a place to move away from my ex and it's odd? It's like a relationship but you've skipped all the beginning parts of getting to know each other because we already knew who we are? It's odd. 

Either way, we spoke about it again and he said that under any other circumstance he would have rejected me. Because you don't date your best friend. He said he'd have asked out the girl from university and that chances are high she would have said yes. That put me off. I'm not sure how to feel. Not even sure what actions to take? I love him, god I love him but this all came so suddenly. PS. My ex said he could totally see my bsf and I dating - ""You could do much worse than him, he's pretty decent."" In our break up talk. 

How would you have acted in my shoes? 
What could I do now to make the best of the situation?

I have put myself into something that resembles a teenage drama show rather than someone's love life and I don't know what to do. ",1,1740939137.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1j1wys3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1j1wys3/umami/,Umami,"Umami, for those who may be unfamiliar, is a Japanese word meaning ""savory"" or ""delicious"" and is actually our 5th taste since we have specific taste receptors for glutamate, which is responsible for umami. Glutamate is an amino acid, and so it's generally associated with protein-containing foods. What does it taste like? It's very difficult to describe a taste, but you know it when it's there because it's what makes food taste so *good*. Now you know the secret of cooking good food! Lol. 

Anyways, umami is also used to describe flavours in wine, and it seems to me very apt, *except* that I'm a bit unclear how it would be present in wine in significant quantities. I do believe that part of what makes fermented foods/beverages so appealing is that microbrial metabolism probably (I don't have scientific evidence for this) releases glutamate from proteins. This probably applies to coffee and tea as well (both are also fermented), part of why *those* beverages became so popular. However, again, I don't see how glutamate could be present in very significant amounts in beverages. The ingredients for these fermented beverages, ie grapes for wine and tea leaves for tea, wouldn't contain much protein, and moreover, that which would remain in the beverage itself would be trace.

There are other foods not considered particularly high in protein but still high in umami, such as tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic and seaweed, so perhaps this also applies to the ingredients for fermented beverages. 

 Still, perhaps this trace amount is enough to excite our taste buds. If anyone has some research on this, I'd love to see it. Thanks. ",1,1740938418.0,wine,0,1.0,False

In fact the snacks are so overpriced that everyone knowns the movie theater is getting most of it's revenue from snack sales, meaning that the movies themselves are basically at cost--which is a deal.

There are a lot of costs and person-hours that go into making a movie, and everyone involved should be paid fairly for their work, so you have to expect to pay something to see the final product. 

I live in the USA, in a smaller, fairly low cost of living city and movie tickets here are $8 for an evening time and $6 for a matinee. That's as cheap as buying a socially acceptable amount of coffee and snacks in order to sit in an air conditioned coffee shop for 2-3 hours.

A nice evening out for the cost of about an hour's work at minimum wage or a fancy loaf of local bakery bread seems like perfectly good deal. If you live in like New York or California, of course everything costs more, but you get paid more too, so the ratio of cost of a movie to cost of other things is probably pretty similar",2,1740938356.0,unpopularopinion,30,0.55,False

The end of 2022 we got back together an since have been working to better our lives and heal what wounds have been left. I won't go into detail there but most can use their imagination about a full 30 years fueled by addiction and cheating. We even attended marriage counseling for roughly 4 months. Recently my spouse mentioned a person with whom a conversation was struck regarding a particular interest of mine. A worker at a coffee shop where my spouse gets coffee. For privacy sake let's say hunting. I paid no real attention but I have been a lifelong hunting enthusiasts. A couple days later my spouse alludes to something else about the conversation, nothing in particular but clearly indicating that this person and the conversation was of some interest to my spouse. Another day or so goes by and my spouse asks me for permission to bring a couple of my hunting books to this person at the coffee shop because my spouse believes this would be of some conversational value? To the coffee shop worker, I guess. But I'm actually highly suspicious and believe that this is either gaslighting or at the least a major boundary violation, that especially considering our past of infidelity and disfunction feels like a slap in the face and I'm considering throwing in the towel.

1j1wwfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1j1wwfs/i_accidentally_angered_a_cryptid_in_the_mountains/,"I accidentally angered a cryptid in the mountains, what do I do?","For a few years now my buddy Anthony and I have jointly owned a cabin out in the Rocky Mountains. Every once in a while we‚Äôll go up there and spend the weekend. We always end up doing the same few activities. After setting up we start a fire in the charcoal stove and make lunch. Then we hike down to the closest lake and go fishing. We‚Äôve only ever caught one fish, Anthony claims he got it, but I definitely did. Before sunset, we hike back and retreat to our bedrooms. I usually read a Stephen King for a few hours until it pulls me to sleep. In the morning we make breakfast and pack up, leaving around noon.



Last month we decided to head up for the new year. Neither Anthony nor I had anything better to do. I woke up early that morning and put on heavy layers. Then, I grabbed a few granola bars for breakfast and prepared my bag. As I walked down my front steps, Anthony‚Äôs red pickup truck cut through the snow to park. His flatbed was filled with unevenly cut pieces of coffee brown wood with burgundy fillings. Next to the wood was a medium cardboard box. I put my backpack in the bed and hopped onto the leather of the passenger seat. He had the radio on playing our local rock station. Anthony took a sip of his thermos,



‚ÄúYou like the tunes?‚Äù



I let out a small chuckle. The music was something by Imagine Dragons that had come out a few years ago. We had always hated the overproduced music they made and joked about it whenever we heard it.



‚ÄúWhat a song, this deserves all the Grammies.‚Äù I joked.



‚ÄúNo no, a few Nobel prizes are more appropriate.‚Äù



As we kept driving, the city around us started to thin as we approached the freeway. The fast food restaurants were replaced with pine trees and the skyscrapers turned to mountains. We had about 2 more hours of driving until we got up to the cabin. As we turned around a bend in the road, the radio station was drowned with static.



‚ÄúDamn it. Could you find something else?‚Äù Anthony muttered.



I turned the knob for a few minutes getting nothing but static. Finally, after a minute or two, I found something local. The station played easy-listening music, something that you would hear in an elevator. Eventually, the music was cut off by the crooning voice of a host. He sounded like he was around 20 and had a slight drawl,



‚ÄúWelcome to KWYU Mountain Mysteries. Today is our Bugfoot mystery hour, if you have any evidence of the Bugfoot call in at xxx-543-6846.‚Äù After he was finished the easy listening faded back in.



Anthony spoke jokingly, ‚ÄúThe fuck is a Bugfoot?‚Äù



‚ÄúA bunch of these areas have their own cryptid, it‚Äôs all just for tourism.‚Äù



After a few more minutes the smooth voice of the host returned,



‚ÄúWe have Randy from Bailey on the line, Randy what do you have for us today?‚Äù



An older man with a gravelly, northern accent spoke,



‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôve lived in this area for a good long while now and have seen plenty of evidence for the Bugfoot, but the other night I saw him right in front of me.‚Äù



‚ÄúRandy that sure is something, please, tell us what happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh it was horrible, I was out on my nightly smoke, the wife doesn‚Äôt want me smoking by the house, and I was walking along the river. It must have been the dry season because I could not find that damn river. The woods have a way of tricking you, it all looked the same and I got lost. Once I realized I didn‚Äôt know those woods, I put out my smoke and looked for light. In the distance, I saw what looked like headlights sitting stationary. I assumed it must have been a car on the highway and thought I could hitchhike back to Bailey.¬†



Once I got about 100 feet away from the lights I noticed they were moving around oddly. I thought it must have been some kids screwing around with their car. Instead of hitchhiking, I thought I would just walk along the highway instead. As I got about 50 feet away I saw that the lights were too high off the ground to be headlights. I called out in their direction and the lights sped up the road faster than any car could.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd what do you think those lights were Randy?‚Äù



‚ÄúThey were the eyes of the Bugfoot of course. He has giant bright eyes that can blind you if you get too close. Everybody knows that.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you, Randy.‚Äù



Randy hung up.



‚ÄúWell folks, what do you think? Was that the Bugfoot, or just some kids screwing around?‚Äù he chuckled.



A different easy listening came on, it was older and sounded like something you would hear on the weather channel.



‚ÄúBugfoot, that's some bullshit.‚Äù Anthony snickered,



‚ÄúOh definitely, it's not even creative, Bigfoot but he‚Äôs a bug. Every weird part of the country wants their own Bigfoot, or Loch Ness Monster, or Mothman.‚Äù



‚ÄúAre they even trying though, they could have at least made the name something better than just a play on Bigfoot‚Äù



The easy listening was cut,



‚ÄúWelcome back, we have Linda from Buffalo Creek on the line, Linda what do you got?‚Äù



A 40ish-year-old woman with a shrill voice came on the line,



‚ÄúThe Bugfoot was trying to get into my house the other day.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat sure sounds scary Linda, whats your story.‚Äù



Anthony joked quietly, ‚ÄúIt sure sounds true.‚Äù



The woman started,



‚ÄúI was coming back home from emptying our latrine in the lake when I saw something outside my house.‚Äù



I shuddered and hoped that Linda‚Äôs lake was nowhere near ours.



‚ÄúThe sun had almost set by then so I couldn‚Äôt get a good look at it. From what I could see it was big and had brown smooth skin. Its face looked like a cricket‚Äôs but it was shaped like a man. Its head had two large black eyes and two long growths on the top. The arms didn‚Äôt end in hands, instead, it had two long hooked fingers. Its legs went backward then bent forwards at the knee and ended in one long foot.‚Äù



‚ÄúWere its eyes bright like Randy said.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs eyes were a lifeless black.‚Äù



‚ÄúSorry to interrupt, continue.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt walked all around my house feeling the walls with its sickly long fingers. After a few minutes, it lost interest and retreated into the woods.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you think it was doing Linda?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt must have been trying to get in. It looked through the windows and tried to,,,‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat did it do Linda?‚Äù



The host sounded slightly more serious. I can‚Äôt imagine he was actually sorry for her, more so, I think he wanted to pry her for more content.



‚ÄúIt tried to kick down the door. Even from as far away as I was, I could hear it pounding on that door. Thankfully it didn‚Äôt break.‚Äù



The host returned to a normal tone,



‚ÄúThank you, Linda, that's all we need.‚Äù



She hung up. The easy listening returned.



‚ÄúProbably just some weirdo, definitely not Bugfoot‚Äù Anthony remarked.



We had gotten way deeper into the forest by then. When you‚Äôre driving through a wooded road there will usually be breakaways to people's private property. We always liked to point out the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trespass for your own good!‚Äù and ‚ÄúStay off my property!‚Äù signs. At this depth, they were all gone and the road seemed to infinitely wind through the pine trees. That nut Randy was correct about one thing, the woods have a way of tricking you. The Rocky Mountain forests consisted of nothing but boulders, moss, and various pine trees. When that's all you see for hours your mind starts to get bored. If I lived there for years my mind would probably come up with a Bugfoot too. My thought was cut off by the return of the host.



¬†‚ÄúNow we have‚Ä¶‚Äù



The host hesitated. After a few seconds, I could hear him stand up and walk away from the microphone, but I could still faintly hear him. He spoke much more casually,



‚ÄúHey, Beth, is the caller ID working? I can‚Äôt see this guy's name or where he is.‚Äù



He got a response that I couldn‚Äôt hear,



‚ÄúOh, um, I guess we‚Äôll take the call then.‚Äù



He sat back down. The mixture of the winding woods and the uneasy speaking of the host brought out a deep unpleasant feeling within me.



‚ÄúHello caller what‚Äôs your story?‚Äù



The sounds that came out of the radio made me feel disgusting. The call had horrible quality, and the man's voice sounded pained like every word was a shard of glass. And the crickets. The second they took the call, the sound of thousands of crickets filled my ears. But that should have been impossible, it was January, the crickets in this area should have been hibernating.



‚ÄúThe Bugfoot is out there.‚Äù



The host dropped his radio voice and now spoke slowly and uncomfortably,¬†



‚ÄúOur audience knows that sir.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo! No! No! The real Bugfoot.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúThe real Bugfoot doesn‚Äôt tap on windows or have headlight eyes, It‚Äôs a killer. I have lived in these woods for years and ain‚Äôt done anything to make it mad, until now. I‚Äôve seen plenty of hikers get stalked by the Bugfoot. Only seen a few actually get killed. They always did something bad for the woods, lit too big a campfire, caught too many fish, whatever. I‚Äôd find them a few days later as a feast for the woods, beaten to death.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about the truth. I‚Äôve lasted longer than most, it‚Äôs been stalking me for about a week now. Don‚Äôt know what I did but the Bugfoot is after me.‚Äù



The crickets got louder. The sounds of their chirps mixed with the quality of the call was nauseating. The host spoke softly,



‚ÄúWhy do you think it‚Äôs stalking you?‚Äù



I heard a faint crash in the background of the call,



‚ÄúFuck. I-I know it‚Äôs been stalking me. When I forage I can hear it out there chirping in a low tone. When I sleep I can hear it walking on my roof. It‚Äôs been hunting me‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat are you gonna do?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to‚Ä¶‚Äù



Anthony turned off the radio.¬†



‚ÄúFuck man, I was interested in that.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat stuff hurt my ears so bad, I felt like driving off the road. Why do you wanna hear that crazy dude anyway? Are you scared the Bugman‚Äôs gonna get you‚Äù he teased,



‚ÄúIt was interesting, of course I don‚Äôt think the Bugfoot is real.

	

Finally, we pulled into the clearing where our cabin rested. Its old, barely shingled roof sagged tiredly, while the old logs looked like they would support them forever. It had snowed recently, the ground was covered in patches of starch-white snow. Intermittently throughout the snow were patches of soft, brown mud. We acted like the place was a minefield, avoiding stepping in or dropping anything in the mud like it would blow our legs off.¬† As I was grabbing my stuff, I noticed the cardboard box again.



‚ÄúWhat's in the box?‚Äù



‚ÄúA little New Year surprise. At sundown, I‚Äôll bring it out.‚Äù



The inside of the cabin was just as cozy as it always was. Once the fire was set in the stove, the warmth filled each room slowly. There was a redundant painting over my bed that showed a temperate forest similar to the one we had just driven through. I put my bags under my bed before I heard Anthony in the other room,



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you bring for lunch.‚Äù



‚ÄúA bunch of stuff for a Dutch lunch.‚Äù



‚ÄúThe fuck is a Dutch lunch?‚Äù



‚ÄúSandwiches stupid.‚Äù I joked.



I pulled out a bag of cold cuts, cheeses, sauces, and vegetables along with a loaf of bread.



‚ÄúI went to a breakfast place in Pueblo a little bit ago that served this.‚Äù



We ate for about an hour, reading our respective books. After eating we went down to the lake to fish. The entire time I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from imagining the mystical Bugfoot just behind the treeline. I was so deep in the daydream that I didn‚Äôt even notice when I got a bite. I unfortunately lost it.



As we got back to shore Anthony had to put together his tackle box just right. While I waited for him to finish I noticed something in the gravel. There were long, deep impressions going down the lakeside. They were thin and ended in a sharp point. Interestingly, the back end of each depression was deeper than the front, as if someone shoved a board into the ground and let it fall. Within each imprint were what I thought were clear brown nuts or seeds. Only now, after doing research, do I realize what they were. Cricket shells.



It was almost nightfall when we got back, so Anthony revealed his New Year surprise. It was a few Roman candles and one of those massive sparklers with a name in Chinese.



‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do nothing for New Years, so I brought up these.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you heard all those stories about people starting forest fires from stuff like this?‚Äù



Anthony knelt down and pushed on the soil.



‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt burn down shit in these conditions.‚Äù



‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right.‚Äù



We made dinner of hot dogs and smores then set up to light the fireworks. It was beautiful. We only lit two of the Roman candles because we realized how boring they were, but the sparkler. The sparkler went on for five minutes, it had all sorts of colors and arrangements that amazed me. Although, when the spectacle ended, all I could think about was what that man said on the radio.



‚Äú...lit too big a campfire, caught too many fish, whatever‚Ä¶‚Äù



Anthony must have been distracted too, because while watching he accidentally bumped into the bed of his truck and all of our firewood rolled into the mud.



‚ÄúGod damn it.‚Äù he exclaimed. It seemed like all his excitement was let out at the same time he spoke.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay dude, I can drive into town and buy some more.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, No, I‚Äôll go, don‚Äôt you remember how bad the roads were coming up? And besides, I don‚Äôt want you getting anywhere near the driver's seat of my truck.‚Äù The fun seems to have lept back into him.



I stood there until I couldn‚Äôt see his brake lights among the pines marching along the Rocky Mountains. Only when everything was still did I notice the ambient sound around me. Chirps.



The fire was on its last leg, what was once a bright summer yellow had become a deep crimson. I decided to read my book by the fire til it died, then I would see if any of the logs were salvageable and throw them in. Unfortunately, I could barely focus on the story, I think it was something about vampires, but my eyes kept drifting up to the window in front of me. The moon was shrouded by clouds and the window was usually completely dark, the silhouette of the trees being the only sight that broke through. Every once in a while the clouds would give way and the light of the moon would faintly light the treeline and path towards the cabin.



Just like at the lake, I couldn‚Äôt stop imagining Bugfoot behind the trees, but this time it was real. Every time the light revealed itself, if only for a moment, I thought I could see the outline of a dark figure. It disappeared so fast I‚Äôm unable to describe it, but it was there. At some point, I looked back down at the page and realized I couldn‚Äôt read. The fire died. I looked into the window. Darkness. The treeline was just barely visible, and the pile of wood was just out of sight.



I slowly reached for the doorknob, it was rusty and felt impossibly cold. At the sound of the first wooden creak, the cold winter air hit me like a thousand metal pins.¬† I only stepped close enough to examine the wood, but as soon as I left the safety of the doorframe, I felt an acute feeling of being watched. It felt like the whole forest was staring at me, hungrily. From my distance, some of the wood looked mostly clean; the wood at the top of the pile had barely touched the mud.



I took another step then stopped. Now that I was wholly out of the cabin, my senses could fully take in the black void around me. The chirping. It was gone. While I was reading, the crickets chirped non-stop, but now they were gone. I should have felt relief, but I couldn‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt feel like they stopped because they left, it felt like when a predator goes completely still before pouncing. I walked as quickly and quietly as I could and grabbed the closest logs. When I had grabbed enough I looked up. My eyes had adjusted, I could distinctly see the clearing around me. Pressed deep into the mud in front of me were those long, thin tracks.



I ran back into the cabin, slamming the door with a force that felt like it would break the frame of its hinges. As soon as the door was closed the crickets started up again. Chirp. Chirp. Chirp. It sounded like there were thousands all around the cabin, taunting me. I covered my ears, but couldn‚Äôt keep out the nauseating cries. I threw the logs on the fire, trying to create something to drown out the cacophony around me. But it didn‚Äôt work. I fell to the floor keeping my ears as close to the fire as possible without burning my hair off. Trying to use the crackles and pops to drown out the shrill singing around me. Then it stopped.



Only for a moment, I was gifted silence. Suddenly, a staccato pounding hit the roof. Something started walking atop the shingles. It sounded as if someone was walking very exaggeratedly. I could hear each distinct thud of the heel and toe. The toe hit was muffled, like there was less force put into it. I hastily, but silently, made my way to my bedroom and dropped to the floor. As I lowered myself, my knee gave out and hit the wood board below me with a forte thud. The stepping stopped. It heard me.



I dropped completely flat and slowly wriggled under the bed. I used my bags to create a barrier between me and the wall, blocking any sightline to me. The stepping didn‚Äôt return for the longest minute of my life. Abruptly, whatever was on the roof started pounding on the shingles. In between thumps, I could hear a few ceramic tiles fall into the snow. I couldn‚Äôt get a clear sightline of the roof, but I could tell it was giving way. Eventually, they gave way with a sickening creak. The logs that broke tumbled to the floor and rolled before settling. The fire was quickly snuffed out by the snow atop the roof quickly plunging to the floor. Silence. Silence returned to me, like an old friend.



The beast dropped down to the floor with an impossible lightness, its feet almost fluttering onto the wood. Its horrible feet. They were the color of autumn leaves and ended in downward hooked yellow points. They were long and impossibly smooth. It was segmented with sharp, yellowed spikes. It's all I could see of it. When it took its first step, I understood how it layed those tracks. All the force went down on the ball of the foot and the hooked ‚Äútoe‚Äù fell to the ground with it. It walked frantically around looking for me. It made almost no sound beyond its steps and I couldn‚Äôt tell what it was doing. It knocked over everything it walked by as if it didn‚Äôt notice them. First a lamp, then a picture frame. It had no direction and didn‚Äôt spend any amount of time in any one place



Eventually, It made its way to where I was hiding. The monster‚Äôs smooth feet were now close enough to reach out and touch. I hoped to god it couldn‚Äôt smell me. It stepped even closer to the bed, then halted. Engine sounds. Anthony was driving back. I watched as the beast‚Äôs feet stopped, turned around,¬† then floated back through the hole with a sickening, reverberating buzzing sound. I stayed still for one more minute then jumped out from under the bed. I grabbed my bags and ran through the door, I went so fast I didn‚Äôt even notice when it began to snow. The cold, fluttering flakes mixed with the fresh tears and sweat on my face.¬†



I yanked on the car door throwing myself into the passenger seat.



‚ÄúTurn around turn around.‚Äù



‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†



Anthony started to speak but then looked inside the cabin which now lay bare in the snow. He turned the truck around and sped back up the trail. We kept the radio off the entire drive. I still don‚Äôt have the willpower to tell Anthony what happened, but now I think I need to. I was planning on keeping this story to myself for the rest of my life, but now I can‚Äôt. I need help, last night it snowed and when I looked out my window the next morning I saw those same long, sharp tracks in my yard.

I bet those works, but what I've observed is that productivity for a particular niche like studying or learning a new instrument, requires that particular process to form neural connections for it to stick

like lot of times, i start with something, get on it for a few days and then drop it off or the frequency reduces, very common

but when i associate a set of cues to it and randomize, the brain tends to do an incredible job at going back to that task every single day

like going to gym, i used to be so inconsistent, but then i added going to this coffee shop to get a black as a pre-workout, everyday different people a new novel experience, and then from the cafe i head to gym, the walk to shop was the cue, the set time of 7-30pm was the trigger, new people were the reward, response was heading to the gym after that.

did it for like 30 days and now i automatically head to gym at that time, no coffee stops needed, the neural connection for this time and the activity associated with it has been formed

i've been trying to do the same for work - like work 5-6 hours everyday, add some cues to the process so it eventually becomes a habit and productivity during those hours become a default state",1,1740938163.0,productivity,0,0.67,False

I had been enjoying vaping and felt some benefit after switching from smoking but then I went in too hard, I was puffing it every chance I got and my health started to take a turn for the worse, breathless and chest pains, my skin would also break out which was just killing my confidence so I just thought this is enough I'm getting this addiction out of my life once and for all. I'd tried so many things before to quit but I was feeling like the substitutes like gums or spray was just keeping the addiction alive so I decided to just go cold turkey. I listened to Allen Carr's easy way on audio book and followed song and quit, I found it do helpful in turning my mind to quiting and initially it really worked. I was still having cravings but I would just get over them, they became less frequent and easier to deal with then....

I had a really stressful day with the kids and my partner and everything just felt a bit much, when I had a craving I just caved, walked off bought a coffee and a disposable vape and just sat in the park puffing the nuts off it. I'm so disappointed in myself, I had 12 days clear and watching my day counter every day I was feeling so proud and I'd gotten over the worst of it. The stress continued into today and I went and bought another one! I plan to get rid of it at the end of the day and start fresh tomorrow. Hopefully the cravings will be okay, I'm working in the middle of nowhere for the next while so I can't just nip off and get one.

Before she passed, she gave me her wedding dress. She told me she wanted me to have it, whether I chose to wear it at my own wedding, repurpose it, or just keep it as a memory of her. It‚Äôs one of the most sentimental things I own.

My older brother, Jake (33M), is getting married in a few months to his fianc√©e, Laura (29F). We have a good relationship, but we‚Äôre not super close. Last week, Laura asked if we could meet up for coffee, and that‚Äôs when she dropped a bombshell.

She told me she had always dreamed of wearing a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù dress when she got married and thought it would be so special if she could wear my mom‚Äôs wedding dress. She said it would be a beautiful way to honor my mom at the wedding.

I was completely caught off guard. I told her that while I appreciated her sentiment, my mom gave the dress to me, and it was very personal. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable letting someone else wear it, especially because I still might want to use it in some way for my own wedding one day.

Laura immediately got upset and said I was being selfish. She told me it wasn‚Äôt fair because she never got to meet my mom, and this would be a way for her to feel connected to her. She also said my mom would have wanted her to wear it since she‚Äôs joining the family.

I stood my ground and told her no. I suggested she find another way to incorporate my mom‚Äôs memory‚Äîmaybe by wearing a piece of my mom‚Äôs jewelry or a pair of her shoes‚Äîbut Laura said that wasn‚Äôt the same.

Now my brother is involved, and he told me I should reconsider because it would mean a lot to Laura. He said I was being unnecessarily difficult over ‚Äújust a dress.‚Äù Even some of my relatives are saying I should ‚Äúthink about the bigger picture‚Äù and how this would be a touching tribute.

I feel guilty, but at the same time, this dress means the world to me. So, Reddit, AITAH for refusing to let her wear it?

Nurse practitioner (new grad),"Postining ANON because i have a weird fear that my hopeful employer is in this group lol anyway.. just had a recent job interview. I \*THINK\* the interview went well. I interviewed two times with an FQHC virtually back in early Feb (once with the entire HR department) and then a second time with the CMO. They planned a ""meet and greet"" for me that was almost 8 weeks later (i would be relocating for the job 9 hours away but i plan on moving to this area anyway so im not necessarily moving for the job, i was traveling to that area to tour preschools and daycares already that day so we planned a meet and greet for then). Anyway, I emailed them and requested if i could shadow as well as do the meet and greet (the meet an greet was scheduled as a brief 15 min tour of the facility and then coffee afterwards at a local coffee shop). They agreed to let me shadow and i couldnt get there until late morning as I had tours set up all morning. My shadowing ran a little into the designated tour and meet and greet times cause i was in patients rooms. They gave me a tour. Introduced me to all the clinicians in the office and introduced me as a ""candidate for the position"". We huddled kind of in the one office afterwards. They asked me some brief non difficult questions such as what do I value most in a position that I am looking for, when I could potentially start, asked me if there would be any barriers to relocating to this area. etc. I told them i couldnt start until August due to childcare (which i know they have a need starting in June). They reassured me saying ""thats totally fine that sometimes credentialing could even take 6 months and its no problem"". I also asked if they would accommodate any lesser FTE and they said they could accommodate 0.8 FTE. The CNO said ""well i feel really good about this"" and said how much of a pleasure it was to meet me etc. HR told me that the meet and greet at the coffee shop is unecessary since they knew I have a very long drive back to my home state and said that they respect my time and if i want to get on the road early that I should and then they said but by any means if iwant to grab coffee I can but they just were reiterating that they felt really bad that I had such a long drive after shadowing and touring schools all morning so I thanked them and told them that I appreciate them allowing me to get on the road sooner (since i had a 9 hour drive). So now im in my head that I totally ruined it all. I feel like they arent going to want someone to start in August when the need begins July and I feel like i shouldnt of brought up a lesser FTE when surely they probably would take someone who would work a full 1 FTE. Is it a bad sign they canceled the meet and greet? I will say when the meet and greet WAS planned months ago that was way before the shadowing was ever planned and my shadowing did run into our scheduled meet and greet/coffee time. They all did pay for my hotel accommodation for the night of my visit. I followed up with an email and they gave me a generic response back with no timeline and at the end of meeting in person they also did say ""we are interviewing other candidates"". Anyone have any opinions? I shadowed this previous Monday and I am dying for a response or an offer so I can solidify my childcare. Thanks for reading this all!",2,1740937970.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

## ‚Å£Understanding ‚ÄãDifferent Types of‚Å¢ Lightweight Camping Cookware Materials

The material of your camping cookware considerably‚Å¢ impacts its weight, durability, heat distribution, and price.‚Äã Let's explore the most common options:

* ‚Äã  **Titanium cookware Camping:** The gold ‚Å¢standard‚Äå for ultralight camping‚Äç cookware. titanium is ‚Å£incredibly‚Äå strong yet exceptionally lightweight. It's also corrosion-resistant and biocompatible. However, titanium doesn't distribute heat evenly,‚Äç leading to potential hot spots. It's also the ‚Äçmost expensive option. Consider titanium ‚Äçcookware ‚Äãcamping if weight is your‚Å§ absolute top priority.

*  ‚Å£ **Aluminum Cookware Camping Lightweight:** A popular and affordable choice. ‚Å¢Aluminum is lightweight and heats‚Å§ up quickly. Anodized aluminum is more durable‚Äã and‚Å¢ scratch-resistant than standard aluminum.Aluminum cookware camping‚Äã lightweight is‚Äç a‚Äå good compromise between weight, cost, and ‚Äçperformance.

* ‚Äå ‚Å§ **Stainless Steel:** A ‚Äçdurable and versatile option. Stainless steel is ‚Å£heavier than ‚Å§titanium and ‚Äçaluminum, but it's more resistant to dents and scratches. It also distributes heat more ‚Äåevenly.Stainless steel is a good choice for car camping, ‚Å£where weight‚Å¢ is less ‚Äçof a concern and durability ‚Å¢is paramount.

*   **Non-Stick Coatings:** Many‚Å£ lightweight camping‚Äå cookware sets feature non-stick coatings. ‚ÄåThese coatings make cooking and cleaning easier, preventing ‚Å¢food from sticking and burning. However, non-stick coatings can‚Å§ be scratched or damaged by ‚Äãmetal utensils. Exercise caution when using them. Non ‚Äçstick camping cookware lightweight is very common aluminum‚Äã sets.

* ‚Äç  **Nesting Design:** Look for cookware that ‚Å£nests ‚Äåtogether‚Äã compactly for easy storage and transport.‚Å¢ A ‚Äåcompact camping cookware set saves a ‚Äçlot of‚Äç space.

## Tailoring Your ‚Å£Cookware Choice to ‚ÄåYour Audience

Let's consider ‚Å£how these factors apply ‚Å£to ‚Å§our specific audience ‚Å£segments:

*   ‚Å£**Backpackers:** ‚Å§Weight is‚Å§ the paramount consideration. They should prioritize ultralight camping cookware made ‚Å£from ‚Äåtitanium or‚Äå thin-gauge aluminum. Every ounce counts, and they are frequently‚Äç enough willing to pay more for ‚Äçpremium, weight-saving materials. Durability is still important, but weight takes precedence. They‚Äôll be interested in cookware for‚Å£ backpacking.

*   ‚Å£**Car Campers:** Can afford‚Å¢ to prioritize durability and features over‚Äã weight.Stainless steel or thicker aluminum ‚Äãcookware with non-stick coatings are good choices. ‚ÄåThey may also‚Äå appreciate larger sets ‚Äãwith more pots and‚Äå pans. Price is more of a factor for this‚Å£ segment.

*   **Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Need versatile cookware that can‚Å¢ be used for camping, picnics, and other outdoor activities.A mid-range aluminum or anodized aluminum set is a good‚Äå compromise ‚Å¢between weight,‚Å§ durability, and price.

It‚Äôs been quite a while (over a year, actually), since my last listing. I had a really turbulent 2024, and it prevented me from being in a place comfortable enough to do proper roleplaying. I had a lot of great partners naturally fade out, and the ones I do still have I very much love, however, have been minimized to a small handful of them, and I‚Äôd like to open the door to a few more. 

I‚Äôm 26 years old (she/they) from Southern California with a full-time job, so my schedule and posting are varied. I‚Äôm huge into doing OOC content like playlist, memes or even reference photos, and I do so even when I‚Äôm unable to write replies. I prefer long term stories where we can really work and dissect characters, worlds and more! My terms are still the same; **3rd person over Discord**, I don‚Äôt do **OC x Canon or crossover content**, I do offer some original stuff stuff depending, and I ask that you be 18+ when reaching out to me.

Onto the series!

**Yellowjackets** - Lottie, Shauna, Van, Natalie, I would love to take a swing at writing for any of them, and I prefer the pre-rescue versions, or even something prior to the crash if it‚Äôs your cup of tea.

**Overwatch** - I can pick up a variety of characters, and I love doing AU‚Äôs for this. I‚Äôm very drawn to playing Mercy, D.VA, Ana, Lucio, Baptiste, Ashe, Cassidy and potentially Widowmaker, Sombra and Sigma as well. 

**Apex Legends** - I would love to get a chance to write for Horizon, Lifeline or Wraith for this series. I had a Wattson run as well that I would love to return to, if given the chance. 

**Interview With The Vampire** - Binged it, loved it, haven‚Äôt had a chance to write for it, but would love to. I think I would be most comfortable writing Louis, Daniel and Claudia, though I could try Lestat and Armand too.

**Cobra Kai** - I JUST finished the finale! Same as above, I haven‚Äôt written for anyone yet, but could try doing Miguel, Tori or Johnny to start. Maybe post series?

**Persona 5** - I‚Äôve had great luck finding people to write with, but most are either on hiatus or have quietly stepped away for the time being. I love writing Akira, Ann, Yusuke and recently, I‚Äôve picked up Makoto.

**Invincible** - Currently caught up with the series, have not gotten to the comics just yet. I can try my hand at Mark, Eve, Cecil, Rae and potentially Rex as well. 

**Wrestling/WWE** - This one is a little more complicated, as I would love to do something specially about the characters in kayfabe. Interview stuff is totally fine, but I don‚Äôt want to bring up actual names or people. I am most interested in playing Rhea Ripley across from either a Dominick or Liv.

The miscellaneous tracks are: **Monster High**, **Kingdom Hearts**, **Disney/Dreamlight Valley style**, **School Spirits**, **The Last of Us**, **Homestuck**, **Fallout TV show**, **The Bear**, **Fullmetal Alchemist**, **Resident Evil** **DC/Marvel** ( especially animated series like Creature Commandos, Harley Quinn show and the early Titans series, as well as Wandavision, and Agatha All Along) and I would love to try **SpyxFamily**, though I‚Äôm very behind on it.

I love doing stories involving **horror** and **romance** especially, however I‚Äôm not opposed to **SOL** or **mystery**. I don‚Äôt often do stories that align with canon since I heavily prefer AU‚Äôs. I have previous ideas from my older post that I would still love to adapt as well.

Specifically, I love things set in **Zombie/Fallout/Apocalypse** style worlds, **Hunger Games/Squid Games/Battle Royales** where we can dive into characters in brutal fights, **spies in a futuristic world or period pieces set in western, 50‚Äôs-90‚Äôs** and **simple Coffee shop/Bakery/Perfect street** settings where we can let characters have fun and be a little more safe. I also love stuff set in **old school Hollywood and Las Vegas.**

My last request is that you reach out to me with a general idea of what you‚Äôd like to do before moving over to Discord. I don‚Äôt open nor respond to ‚Äúhey wanna write‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs RP‚Äù messages, as I find them to often lead nowhere. I don‚Äôt mind returning partners, however, I don‚Äôt like being dropped randomly after a week of planning, OOC chats and excitement. Just let me know you‚Äôd like to step out and I‚Äôll be totally content with it.

If you‚Äôre at all interested, please feel free to DM me with the word **Psychic** so I know you‚Äôve read through everything seen here. 

Thank you for checking out my post, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!

It‚Äôs not terrible here, but it‚Äôs just not the place for me. The winters are too harsh, I hate the lack of sun for half the year, and there‚Äôs not enough ‚Äúculture‚Äù for me. I miss great shopping, CAVA, and winters that don‚Äôt make me want to sleep all day. 

I‚Äôm currently working on my career so I wouldn‚Äôt be moving for another year. I‚Äôm a legal assistant working on my paralegal certificate. Once I get my certificate, depending on the area, I should be making upwards of 60k a year if that helps. 

I‚Äôd really like a place with more culture like I said. So probably a bigger city (not nyc level tho). I‚Äôm also not looking to move to the Deep South, I‚Äôm from central Texas and it was wayyy too hot and republican for me. I would be willing to consider North Carolina and up. Coastal living would be great too, but I‚Äôm open to whatever :) 

Things I have in mind for likes/dislikes:

‚Ä¢ Liberal politics, or at least mixed 

‚Ä¢ Decent weather. I‚Äôm fine with snow, as long as it‚Äôs under 30 inches a year. I hated hot Texas summers, but might be willing to put up with hotter summers if the winter is still an actual winter. 

‚Ä¢ Higher paying jobs 

‚Ä¢ Not an insane COL. I know that the best places have a higher COL but I don‚Äôt need anything on San Fran/nyc level. Missoula is about 6% above the national average for COL, I could probably handle going up that scale a little more if the job market matches. 

‚Ä¢ Dog friendly! I‚Äôve got a staffy who loves people and loves to accompany me on adventures 

‚Ä¢ Medium sized to slightly larger population 

‚Ä¢ Great job market 

‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt need a robust social scene. I love coffee shops, parks, great shopping and museums, but I don‚Äôt really care about night life. 

‚Ä¢ Somewhere with legal weed would be awesome, but I‚Äôm willing to go without if the spot is otherwise great

‚Ä¢ I am Jewish, so a couple synagogues in town and a mikveh within an hour or two of me would be ideal! 


Places I like: 
‚Ä¢ Boston! I‚Äôve visited once and it was amazing. I loved the vibe. But it‚Äôs too expensive and snows too much for me personally. 

‚Ä¢ Wilmington, NC. I visited in August and it was so lovely!  It might be a little too hot for me, but if everyone thinks it matches up with what I like, I‚Äôll consider it more :) 

‚Ä¢ Alexandria, VA. I have not visited here, but based off of what I‚Äôve seen, it looks right up my alley. Everyone said it was super expensive, but when I‚Äôve checked apt listings, I found decent apts around $1400-1600. Being in the law field, I was thinking the DC area could be great for that. 

‚Ä¢ Savannah, GA. I visited several years ago, but loved the slightly spooky vibe and how beautiful things were. Again, too hot for me, but willing to consider this :)

I‚Äôm 26 years old (she/they) from Southern California with a full-time job, so my schedule and posting are varied.

I‚Äôm really big into doing OOC content like playlist, memes or even reference photos, and I do so even when I‚Äôm unable to write replies. I prefer long term stories where we can really work and dissect characters, worlds and more! My terms are; **3rd person over Discord**, **3-8+ paragraph style**, and I ask that you be **over 18+**when sending me any PMs. 

Currently, I am seeking partners who‚Äôre interested in doing **WLW plots themed around popular Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift songs.** Yes, this seems rather ridiculous, but I would LOVE to explore some of these concepts with someone equally as excited in both artist as I am.

Maybe *Casual* feelings between our characters has drama ensuing when one wants their relationship to become more serious than the other? What if one says *Good Luck, Babe* and leaves their small town for the big city, starts a new life, only to return years later with unrequited feelings? Maybe something with a larger cast of characters, gathering at a *Pink Pony Club* better suits your style?

Leaning towards our other artist, we could do a classic love triangle or tragedy like the songs *Betty*, or *The Last Great American Dynasty*? Best friends turned enemies, maybe back into lovers with *My Tears Ricochet*, or some classic, easygoing SOL like *You Belong With Me* ? Worlds out oyster!

I also love settings placed in **Las Vegas**, **50‚Äôs-90‚Äôs**, **travelers who meet but can‚Äôt stay**, as well as simple **coffee-shop, bookstore, record store and city/small town life** locations.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, fantastic! My last request is that you reach out to me with a general idea of what you‚Äôd like to do before moving over to Discord. I don‚Äôt open nor respond to ‚Äúhey wanna write‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs RP‚Äù messages, as I find them to often lead nowhere.

If you‚Äôre at all interested, please feel free to DM me with the word **PINK ERA** so I know you‚Äôve read through everything seen here. 

Thank you for checking out my (rather bizarre tbh) post, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!

I had to wake up early on my day off, the free coffee was extremely mid, and the introduction included at least twenty minutes of being reminded to please not scare the youth. The projects covered a broad range, from students who clearly used their mother's access to a state of the art research facility, to students who figured it out last minute on their own. The majority did not find significant results--several students had never heard of such a thing--and overall there was an overwhelming abundance of fuzzy bar charts with no clear axis labels. 

It was amazing. 

I am a sarcastic bastard on a good day, but... this is something. These students worked incredibly hard on some very interesting, off-the-wall ideas, and you could really start to see each of them find a niche for themselves in the vast web of scientific disciplines. They lit up to talk about how they raised two types of cells, and how differently they grew; or how they used R for the first time, or how their research plant died but in a really unexpected way. They spoke of the future, wanting to be doctors or researchers or just, ""out there collecting frogs, I hope!"" 

It was amazing to see how much they knew about their projects--and also how much they had to learn, when I asked a question just to the left of what they studied up on to prepare. 

We've got a whole generation of scientists on their way in, preparing as best they can to find their place and help the world, and generations after that too. When you give them the chances to succeed, they grow into science as naturally as a plant does in soil; *it would be an impossible feat to stop research forever.* 

And this room was filled with representatives from organizations that I know for a fact have lost or are actively losing their funding on a national scale. High level experts with their jobs at stake just mingling, giving advice, handing out awards and certificates, still present and active and supporting science. 

Things are dire in America. I am certain a lot of us labrats are currently here, unable to look away from the news, carefully weighing the various degrees, certificates, and work positions that maintain our self-image and our position in this world as a person who progresses society through 'discovery and innovation,' something like that. You know, the things we make fun of but quietly believe fervently, desperately. 

I guess I just wanted to let someone else know--volunteering, judging science fairs, participating in outreach helps more than others. We all know this. But reminders are good to have. ",25,1740937329.0,labrats,1,0.93,False
1j1wigf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1wigf,My earliest Mst3k memories before becoming a full-time fan,"Wanted to collage this into one big post, so here we go: 

These are some of my earliest Mst3k memories of casually watching with my parents/knowing of its existence before becoming a full-time fan at 6 years old in 1999:

The first is this season 4 Joel and the bots mug from 1992. My dad ordered this from the info club and this coffee mug was in our kitchen cabinet for years (before it eventually became mine). Unfortunately, it lost *a lot* of paint over the years, so a new mug was *big* on my to get list. And I managed to do just that on eBay in 2013 when I was 21. Really grateful I found this. I gave the old mug away to an old friend I no longer talk to (but I honestly doubt he even has it anymore). I think looking at this mug was what made me suddenly became interested in the show again in 1999 when I was 6. 

The second is this season 4 Joel and the bots poster from 1992. I remember going down into my basement for the very first time when it was just nothing more than a cold, empty part of the house with no carpet or flooring and walls weren‚Äôt even put in yet (it was all just wall insulation bags). But what caught my eye was seeing this poster hung up in our basement on the walls after watching an episode with my parents; I can‚Äôt exactly recall if it was a Joel or Mike episode because I know I had seen at least one Mike episode, maybe a few more; the tire hatch door came flooding back to me when I had randomly seen one Mst3k promo shortly beforehand, which I think was also what got me interested in the show again as well, so I know I saw my fair share of Mike stuff, but I don‚Äôt know if it was a local ad or Sci-fi one since MST did also air locally on some channels. Regardless, I thought the poster looked really cool with the cast all around the spaghetti ball in space. Unfortunately, this poster got ripped when the walls eventually *were* put in, so I hadn‚Äôt seen it since. Seeing the poster in the 1992 Mst3k live performance section in the scrapbook tape was what triggered all my memories, and I remember every now and then for *years* trying to find on eBay a new copy of that poster with zero luck. My luck eventually came in 2015 when I was 22 when I had found a copy of the poster on eBay with a few minor tears that can easily be hidden with thumb tacks. I had found the same poster previously a year ago but the sides were cut off to make it fit in a picture frame. Was kind of bummed there but just brushed it off for now since I was just grateful to have the poster again *at all* at that time. But yeah, I gave my old copy to a good friend of mine (but I don‚Äôt think he has it anymore unfortunately). 

The third is the ending to ‚ÄúMitchell.‚Äù What mostly stuck out for me for *years* with the show was Joel being on the hexfield (for whatever reason) and the bots packing with Servo‚Äôs head falling off (I remember being pretty weirded out seeing that at the time, lol). That said, I had remembered both instances as two separate episodes and only Servo packing like he was having an episode and Gypsy and Crow just looking at him awkwardly, lol. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had just imagined all this until I watched the episode for the first time ever in full in 2003 at 10 years old when I was in a *really big* MST mood at the time and binging through my dad‚Äôs giant library of Comedy Central MST recordings I now proudly own (and most you can find on YouTube via myself and TarlCabot25), and everything just suddenly came flooding back to me. It‚Äôs since become one of my favorite Joel episodes and a  good way to send him off with a bang. I don‚Äôt recall if my parents were watching this one live or if it was on our world premiere recording, but I‚Äôm inclined to believe it is because I *think* I remember seeing the Comedy Central logo at the very bottom. Oh, if only I could go back in time and see, lol.

Last of all is the theatrical movie that I‚Äôm pretty sure my local Movie Gallery had. I remember as a kid being pretty mind-blown seeing the show in film format with bigger sets and an overall bigger feel and look the movie had. While just another average episode in theatrical movie format, I absolutely love it and it holds a huge special place for me with how big of a rewatch it was for me as a kid. And while I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of ‚ÄúThis Island Earth‚Äù as a movie, I think it was a great choice for the show‚Äôs theatrical flick. 

But, yeah. Fun looking back at these old memories

1j1whx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/100thupvote/comments/1j1whx8/reluctantly_sharing_my_thoughts/,(Reluctantly) sharing my thoughts,"These are my notes on South Korea as someone who has lived and traveled throughout the country in the recent past. Comparisons are with respect to the United States unless stated otherwise. Readers who have also lived in South Korea may find some of these items ordinary; others may be contentious, depending on who the reader is and accordingly the perspective they are likely to have. I encourage Koreans to form their own opinions about what is contained herein, and about matters pertaining to Korea in general.



**Ïû•Ï†ê**



**1** The cats. They‚Äôre part of the community. You can tell how friendly a neighborhood is by how many there are.

**2** Even on the streets of large cities, the very young and the very old are out and about in high frequencies. This creates a sort of perceived togetherness of the Korean people.

**3** Eating at convenience stores. I loved the pre-made meals, especially the ones at GS25.

**4** The many colorful murals near elementary or middle schools. In passing by on the sidewalk, I‚Äôd reminisce about my own childhood, and get a hopeful feeling at these vague symbols of the country‚Äôs future.

**5** Lack of tipping. The culture is so bad in the US, and its absence so refreshing in Korea, it‚Äôs hard to put into words.

**6** At some businesses - such as hair salons - there are often multiple people taking care of you, in a way that would feel unnecessary or inefficient in the US. I liked this and found it comforting, as if I‚Äôm part of the family and they‚Äôre taking care of me, and also taking care of each other by not being ruthlessly efficient.

**7** I was never put on hold for long or forced to deal with complicated automated systems in calling customer service lines.

**8** The tax system appeared to be an order of magnitude simpler, and I could go to a district tax office and get step-by-step instructions on what to do at no charge.

**9** Comprehensive public transit and the resultant walkability and ease of inter-city travel.

**10** Cleanliness on subways and buses and the harmonious nature of their clientele. My frame of mind went from ‚Äúalright, here we go‚Ä¶‚Äù to hardly thinking about the use of such transportation.

**11** Extensive pedestrian space. Though densely populated, it‚Äôs an easy country to just ‚Äúhang out‚Äù in.

**12** Pedestrian movement is less structured, which has a corresponding con (**Îã®Ï†ê** **8**) but can be a relief from watching two people go back and forth as to who should exit the elevator first.

**13** People are more pleasant to be around in a physical sense, in that few have mammoth bone structures or are muscled to the brim, or are obese to the point that they get in others‚Äô way or take up an excess amount of space. There is also a dearth of foul human odors (wastes, BO, etc.)

**14** Safety - essentially any time, any place. A whole category of Reddit posts is unnecessary. For some, it may not only mean existing activities are safer, but allow new possibilities for how they live their lives.

**15** Noticeably lower levels of behavior one might classify as brazen, abrupt, suspicious, weird, discordant, and other similar adjectives. South Korea feels safer in a much wider sense, extending far beyond rates of criminal activity.

**16** Daiso for (almost) everything.

**17** The volume of convenience stores and other retail, and the resulting rarity of lines. It was very unusual for me to wait in a line more than a couple deep, or to have difficulty finding a seat at a place like a coffee shop.

**18** Naver. More useful than Google Maps is in the US, I think.

**19** Activities that should have been routine were‚Ä¶routine. In the US, the average level of drama in conducting one‚Äôs business is higher, and while some of it is positive, I could do without the various disturbances, inefficiencies, and prima donna-like conduct.

**20** The simplicity of rental contracts. Of the many I signed, one was two pages and the rest fit on a single page. My latest in the US stretched into novella territory, coming in just shy of 100 pages.

**21** During my time in the country, health insurance was very affordable and it felt like doctors were providing healthcare services first and running a business second. (I‚Äôm unaware how recent events may have changed either of these observations).

**22** Public restrooms in crowded areas - even ones where many less well-off or possibly homeless people are around - that are accessible from the street and perfectly functional. When I try to hit the restroom at a restaurant or coffee shop in a US neighborhood with homes I will likely never be able to afford and still find that a code is needed, I yearn to be back in Korea.

**23** The absence, or at least minimal presence of, hard drugs. I didn‚Äôt need to ask if there were tweakers in this neighborhood or on that side of town.

**24** When a major crime occurs, it seems the most common result is that the arrested party quickly admits guilt and apologizes. The experience of following similar news in the US tends to be longer-lasting to say the least - alternatingly tedious and infuriating - and is a hidden surcharge its residents pay.

**25** While its geographic diversity may be limited by comparison, there always seemed to be hills and views to be found and the overall beauty of the country surprised me somewhat.

**26** The uniqueness of nearly every city I visited, despite having traveled to dozens of them. Some selection bias is probably at work, but I never got the sense that everything felt the same or everything looked the same.

**27** Í≥†ÏãúÏõê, particularly newer/nicer ones. They are affordable self-contained apartments, they are amazing, and I doubt they would ever work in the US.

**28** A plethora of cheap motels in every city that were clean enough, felt safe and were of passable quality in other respects; what one tends to get at a comparable price point in the US is considerably less appealing.

**29** Drinking in public, though I‚Äôm unsure of its actual legal status. I loved being able to drop into a convenience store, grab a beer, and enjoy it as I explored a city.

**30** Traditional dress by women. One of the few apparent vestiges of the past in daily life.

**31** The older women one observes selling produce or processing agricultural goods here and there throughout a city. Like the above, there is something I find beautiful about this.

**32** 70-year-old women with purple hair.

  


I could write a summary waxing a bit of poetic, but the picture should be clear. A few abstract notions, like never feeling dread in having to deal with ‚Äúthe public,‚Äù and not feeling other parties (individuals, businesses, government agencies) were constantly trying to extract the absolute maximum, have been left out. Possible reasons behind many of these items - one of which I think is the simple fact that people are on average more related to each other - have also not been explored.



**Îã®Ï†ê**



**1** Mosquitoes.

**2** The country feels fairly regional given its size, and while this means travel is more interesting, it can be disheartening. Most notably, my sense was that people in Jeolla and Gyeongsang perceive themselves to be more distant from each other than do, say, Northerners and Southerners in the US.

**3** Not as much climate diversity, in particular having nothing that is remotely Mediterranean-like.

**4** There are few barber shops outside of trendy areas, and barbers are less confident and probably even less competent on average than those in the US. One also has the pure idiocy of their galavanting off to Europe in order to (over)pay for a (probably useless) certification intended to show other Koreans that they know a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù manner of cutting hair‚Ä¶or something like that.

**5** Cramped living quarters and a general lack of life comforts in comparison to nicer areas of the US. The overall standard of living is not the same.

**6** Feeling distanced from broader events and cultural trends. This is a minor complaint in the short term, as part of the appeal of Korea is that of a simpler place (where one goes to escape the problems of the world, yadda yadda) but in the long run the feeling that one is well downstream of the action might be harder to cope with.

**7** If I have one major concern in living there again, it‚Äôs probably diet. Informally, it‚Äôs like the South Korean grocery store caters to the diet of a K-pop idol while the American grocery store caters to a variety of lifestyles (couch potato, health nut, athlete‚Ä¶)

**8** Less ‚Äúwithitness‚Äù in pedestrian behavior. This is the flipside of **Ïû•Ï†ê** **12**. I actually observed this most sharply in going back and forth between South Korea and Japan on an old trip - movement was unmistakably smoother and more orderly in the latter.

**9** Shower + toilet combos.

**10** Interactions with foreigners seem to be highly disadvantageous in general:

**(i)** The extravagant price of foreign goods, whether luxury items or simply ice cream at a grocery store. I would love to know how high the margins of foreign retailers tend to be; I hear that they really, really like South Korea.

**(ii)** If someone put forth a proposal that travelers to the US should get a refund of any taxes paid during their visit, I do not imagine it would go over well.

**(iii)** Self-discrimination in favor of foreigners, for example in often refusing to hire ethnic Koreans as English teachers.

**(iv)** Imagine a Korean couple walking into a honky-tonk in Texas. First, suppose that they feel no need to speak English out of any fear that speaking in Korean would be met by mockery (or worse). Next, suppose that not only is this true, but they realize it is actually preferable to speak Korean, because it is likely they will be treated better by doing so. Comical as this is, the equivalent is a reality in South Korea. At times I would force myself to speak the native language even when instinct suggested the interaction would go more favorably if I spoke English.

**(v)** Imagine Koreans being flown en masse to NYC in order to teach Korean to children there. Picture well-to-do parents on the UES fixating on the importance of Korean language education for their children and administrators of Korean language academies arranging for travel reimbursements and free housing in Greenwich Village.



I don‚Äôt understand the value proposition of the English obsession. Very few people seemed to be both competent and comfortable speaking it. I can‚Äôt speak Spanish either, but my school didn‚Äôt have to fly someone in from another continent and put them up to get me to that point. The foreign schools look to be similarly ridiculous; I would speculate that those profiting most are the (largely non-Korean) people running them, the (actual) foreigners attending them, and the Western institutions that attending Koreans are dreaming of (via application fees, merchandise - e.g., all the kids running around with Yale t-shirts, etc.)

**(vi)** Envision a Korean man, one who cannot speak a lick of English, dining at a fancy Italian restaurant in NYC, then spending several minutes haggling the bill down with the staff as they giggle at his jokes, speaking only in Korean. I watched the reverse of this happen in South Korea. It‚Äôs an example of social phenomena that aren‚Äôt just more or less common in one place or another, but that literally never happen in reverse. From it, you can see that different groups are positioned to each other in very unequal ways.

**(vii)** There‚Äôs nuance to the subject of bad behavior in public, in that locals and foreigners both exhibit some types at above-average rates. But almost without exception, if an individual or a group behaved in a way I thought was egregious, they fell into the latter category. Typical examples for locals - spitting, old ladies pushing and shoving in the subway station, somewhat juvenile social behavior - never hit the same way as young, able-bodied men occupying seats for the elderly or pregnant women on the subway, intentionally taking up all the space at picnic tables outside convenience stores, boorish interpersonal behavior (e.g., mocking the Korean language), or flipping out in public spaces. I could sense the attitude and the aggression, and it‚Äôs evident Koreans are not comfortable around these people or feel as though they have no control over their continued presence (perhaps both), generally voicing no objection as far as I saw.

**(viii)** It is no secret that moving to South Korea in order to ‚Äúteach English‚Äù often belies principal objectives that are more unseemly in nature, and similarly for various other kinds of entrants to the country. I recommend taking the problem seriously. If some trade deals or tourism dollars are lost in the short run, that‚Äôs unfortunate, but when a civilization allows itself to be used in such a fundamental way, it‚Äôs broken.

**(ix)** The nominally baffling presence of the US military appears to be a topic requiring the mature adult to understand all sorts of history and complexity. Smaller entities like corporations and individuals can also find themselves in situations that seem far from ideal, which are rationalized via having to ‚Äúunderstand the context,‚Äù that ‚Äúit‚Äôs complicated,‚Äù and so on. The question I would pose to the government is whether the maintenance of foreign military bases on its soil, the diminished sovereignty in ceding command of its own military, the pernicious influence on internal (i.e., North-South) affairs, and other ancillary impacts are truly justified on a fundamental basis, and if not, whether the only real impediment to their end is a *good* form of brazenness, in which an entity aggressively moves towards what it believes is in its best long-term interests, regardless of any hurt feelings or short-term effects.

**(x)** The Jurgen Klinsmann story encapsulates several forms of lunacy and deserves mention on its own. Fixation by an (East) Asian country on a magical foreigner, typically from Europe or North America. Said magical foreigner does not care about the Asian people who hired him, with predictable results. The magical foreigner is nonetheless paid an enormous sum of money. Without recourse and accustomed to being on the losing end of such exchanges, many of the Asian people find themselves unable to criticize the magical foreigner, some actually rooting for their getting a lot for doing very little, despite the fact that, like **(vi)**, the reverse situation never occurs.

**(xi)** So much of what South Korea does is on foreign, namely Western, platforms. This is apparent in sports for example, where top clothing and equipment is purchased from Western companies, Westerners are hired and paid handsomely in leadership positions (e.g., the previous item), overhead is paid in some form or another to international bodies with little or no South Korean representation, and since they are not at the top in the most popular sports, a social cost is incurred by its people perpetually looking up to foreign heroes. If one counters that South Korea has platforms of its own, say the K-pop industry, I would be skeptical of what a careful analysis would show. A teenage girl in Illinois clicking on a YouTube link for a K-pop song, or even attending a K-pop concert in Chicago (for which only a fraction of the proceeds makes its way back to South Korea) is not the same as a teenage girl in Seoul dreaming of attending a performing arts school in the US in order to train under some prominent educator - who with immense likelihood is not of East Asian let alone Korean descent - then paying full freight at stratospheric US costs and, having practically thrown their entire life into this basket, finding themselves heavily incentivized to give of themselves even further if necessary in order to make the whole ridiculous scenario work.



Five general comments about **Îã®Ï†ê** **10**. First, if this is not clear already, I have been imprecise in using the word ‚Äúforeigner,‚Äù as I am not thinking about people of East or Southeast Asian descent, including overseas Koreans, who in my experience would generally also be regarded as foreigners. Overseas Koreans are an interesting group, as one hears of frequent condescension towards native South Koreans, but that‚Äôs a separate discussion.



Second, although the term ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù was used, my intention was not to endorse any existing political ideologies, and I do not believe South Korea‚Äôs issues with respect to foreigners fall neatly into a Western vs. non-Western framework. In English-language discourse, I assume this is the predominant lens through which those issues are viewed: one either idealizes South Korea as being a sidekick of the West, or else wishes South Korea was part of some grand non-Western (or anti-Western) coalition. My approach was to instead focus on what I saw, heard and read during my time there, trying to assess what tends to happen when people from South Korea and people not from South Korea come into contact.



Third, I want to clarify how my perspective differs from anti-foreigner sentiment in the US, as that seems relevant at the present time. In the US, it is not hard to identify *potential* advantages to the incumbent population from immigration: less expensive labor, a pool of prospective romantic partners from lesser economic backgrounds (e.g., ‚Äúmail-order brides‚Äù), and more abstractly, by bringing new people in, those running the show (say, a top educational institution) are able to broaden the base of the pyramid in which they lie at the top. Without sidetracking into the pros and cons of these and other factors or opining on whether the net benefit is positive or negative, the point is that a clear acquisition of resources exists. In South Korea, though the country may be better off than it would be in a vacuum, the present resource transfer appears to flow heavily in the opposite direction. Further, these interactions bear little resemblance to anything that might have benefited the country in the past or may benefit it in the future, as if there were some ebb and flow that equals out over time. What, if anything, are South Koreans actually getting? I‚Äôd liken it to a small town kid making a cool friend in the big city, copying their tastes, beliefs, and mannerisms, deriving a sense of status in comparison to their fellow small town folks from doing so, and, all relationships needing some kind of give and take, also deferring to this cool friend, taking their abuse, helping them whenever asked, giving their body if that makes sense, and in general placing themselves under this person in a hierarchy of human beings. One day, though, the small town kid might realize their cool friend was not so cool after all, and further that the person was never actually their friend, only someone who needed another resource, another follower. It would be unreasonable to recommend that South Korea close itself to foreigners or foreign influences entirely, but what I hope is that it reaches the point where any negative impacts are carefully monitored and managed.



Fourth, I suspect the views espoused here differ substantially from what is commonly found on social media. If true, this is yet another area where South Koreans (and Koreans more generally) lose, by being guilt-tripped into a further extraction of tangible and intangible resources. I again urge the Korean reader, especially one who was not raised in South Korea, to form independent opinions - spend time in the country if you have not done so already - and ask yourself whether the claims of people who are shrieking and screeching as they make condescending faces and aggressive body movements in the direction of their cameras are more likely to be correlated with the truth, or inversely correlated with the truth.



Fifth, **(i)** through **(xi)** have hardly scratched the surface, with much left unsaid about a number of ideological and cultural influences and other ways in which the people of South Korea too often position themselves poorly with respect to foreigners (e.g., an obsession with acquiring a ‚ÄúWestern boyfriend,‚Äù or with making foreign friends in general). Any entity that situates itself with respect to an external party the way South Korea has to outsiders and outside influences is setting itself up to be taken advantage of. Zooming out, what‚Äôs happening on the peninsula is that its two political divisions have chosen opposite ends of the spectrum on this matter, each approach having severe flaws; perhaps a middle ground would be beneficial for both.",1,1740937269.0,100thupvote,1,1.0,False

Same thing as the coffee grinder, in real life you don't measure it out! And this kind of thing is often only remeasured maybe once or twice a year. I do like though that you have to wait a certain amount of time before the espresso is ready or not though! 


## **Steaming Wand** (11/10)

INCREDIBLY ACCURATE!! I was shocked by the game's technical explanation the first time you use it. In real life it works EXACTLY like it does in game. Angled jug at milk, hold the jug so the wand's head is at the milk's surface to create foam, then dip the head towards the bottom to heat it and create movement in the milk. Love this! 


## **Drinks** (?/10) 

Honestly there's not much I can say about this as many coffee places make their drinks differently, so what may be right for one place will be wrong for another. HOWEVER... There is a universal truth that, when making an Americano, the espresso goes on top of the hot water. Irl you would get angry coffee enthusiasts if you did it the other way round ;) 


## **Customers** (100/10)

More accurate than real life. You think the requests in this game are crazy? This is just a step in the water. Americano without coffee? Latte but with no foam, milk, and with ice and water? JUST MOOING AT YOU?? Yep, very accurate, and in real life it's even more frustrating. Irl you can't just teleport back to your coffee, you have to check if their ""americano without coffee"" is just hot water, only for them to angrily say they don't want hot water they want an ""americano without coffee"" :"") ",5,1740936953.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,1,0.86,False

I've been working on a response pst to use throughout Reddit beow, but it feels a little disingenuous to me. So I'd love some advice!

Have you tried my recently released app [BrainDrain](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6741376368?pt=126432392&ct=reddit-comment&mt=8) yet? I was struggling with how to get all my thoughts out of my head, so I went to work building *BrainDrain*. When I started showing it to people, they said I should make it available, so I did. Here‚Äôs why it might click for you too:

üåü **Time-boxed journaling that‚Äôs actually fun**: I never got into staring at a blank page, but always valued the release of journaling. So I concentrated on giving myself one minute to get my thoughts out. You see the timer, and you go.

üß† **Sort and ditch your thoughts**: Then you take a few moments to sort through the thoughts you just drained using card sorting. Think Tinder, for your brain.

üîó **Integrations to boost productivity**: Once you've tamed your thoughts you can take action on them by sending them to the calendar, reminders, asking a friend for help, or simply blowing them up.

üîí **Your deepest thoughts are not for sale**: It's important to me that you feel free to shed our thoughts. That's why your info stays on your device and your private iCloud only. We don‚Äôt read, store, or sell your thoughts to the highest bidder. It‚Äôs your brain, your rules.

üéâ **Free mode forever**: You will always be able to drain your brain once a day for free. If you need a greater release or more interactivity and insights you can subscribe for less than cost of a cup of coffee per month.

Check it out on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6741376368?pt=126432392&ct=reddit-comment&mt=8). I have some limited promo codes for extended trials too if you reach out.

1j1warz,https://www.reddit.com/r/100thupvote/comments/1j1warz/from_rejection_to_marriage_has_anyone_experienced/,From Rejection to Marriage: Has Anyone Experienced Their Journey? (Long read),"* FAKE NAMES, not real name


It‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs out in the open. After months of silence, I‚Äôve finally told my family and friends: I‚Äôm getting divorced. And truth be told, I wanted to keep it quiet for a while, but my ex made sure everyone knew, so here we are.

I‚Äôve just submitted everything to the UAE court, and soon, I‚Äôll be legally free. It‚Äôs surreal‚Äîlike the last chapter of a story I didn‚Äôt expect to be writing.

Before I met Ali*, my ex-husband, I had a completely different life. I was in a relationship with Haroon*, a kind soul I met through mutual friends. He was a teddy bear: soft-spoken, sweet, a little heavier-set‚Äîdefinitely the type of guy you wouldn‚Äôt expect me to end up with. Honestly, I‚Äôm embarrassed about my haram past and dating before marriage but I have to share this for it to make sense.

Haroon and I would meet maybe once a month for coffee or lunch, and honestly, that was enough. Life was busy from both sides but there was something comforting about it. He was funny, and the best part was that he‚Äôd repeat the dumb inside jokes I‚Äôd say, and it made me feel like we shared something special. Even his mom knew about me. We‚Äôd talk on the phone, and she‚Äôd gush about how lovely I was. We made plans to meet in person, but somehow, we never got around to it.

One day, we had lunch at a restaurant, and just 15 minutes in, Haroon‚Äôs cousins and their spouses‚Äîabout 14 people in total‚Äîwalked in and saw us. They invited us over to their table, and as we all sat down, it felt like family. They joked with Haroon, telling him, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt lock this down, you‚Äôre making a big mistake.‚Äù It was a lighthearted moment, but the message hit me in a way I didn‚Äôt expect.

Haroon shared the great lunch date with his stepbrother, Jawid*. Jawid was wealthy flashy, but I wasn‚Äôt. He thought Haroon could do better, and it was clear he didn‚Äôt like me, though I never knew why. He told Haroon repeatedly that he could do better and to give his/jawid‚Äôs wife‚Äôs sister a chance. I wasn‚Äôt suppose to know this but unfortunately I saw the text while Haroon was showing me a video on his phone and I confronted him.

I remember having a game night with my siblings one evening, and I invited Haroon. It was a casual get-together with just siblings, and I thought it would be nice to finally have him meet them. But he flaked. This wasn‚Äôt the first time something like that happened‚Äîhe‚Äôd always seemed to pull back on important things, like engaging with my family. My siblings knew about him, but he never made the effort to call or meet them. It felt strange, and they started asking me why he didn‚Äôt try to be more involved.

This made me realize that if he wasn‚Äôt serious about these things, he probably wouldn‚Äôt be serious about marriage either. Despite all the lavish gifts and thoughtful gestures, his lack of consistency left me uncertain about our future. So, after months of these monthly lunch dates, I made the tough decision to break up with him. It wasn‚Äôt easy, because Haroon had everything I wanted in a partner. But after a year of waiting for him to step up, I knew that if he wasn‚Äôt ready now, he wasn‚Äôt going to be.

I changed my number and went no contact. Five months later, I went for Umrah, where I met my ex-husband, Ali. It was a whirlwind. Ali and I connected almost immediately. We were both drawn to each other, and just nine weeks later, we were married. I moved to Saudi, thinking I had made the right decision.

But life, as it often does, threw me a curveball. My mom returned to America after my nikkah in Saudi, bringing back gifts from Mecca for the women at her local mosque. Among the gifts she handed out was a favor for Haroon‚Äôs mom. Of all the women in the mosque, what were the chances? My heart sank when I heard about it. The universe has a funny way of making sure past chapters aren‚Äôt fully closed before opening new ones.

I ran into Haroon yesterday at the supermarket, and my heart immediately sank. I had no idea how he would react‚Äîwhether he‚Äôd confront me, get emotional, or just walk away. To my surprise, he came over with a big smile, like nothing had changed, and said, ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù as if he was genuinely happy to see me. He asked how I was, and before I could answer, he repeated one of our old inside jokes. It was such a familiar moment that I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. I‚Äôm pretty sure the entire supermarket heard me.

Then, he said something that threw me off: he was sad when my mom announced the news about my marriage at the masjid because he thought I had been unfaithful. My mom had cleared it up later when she told her friends that I had met my ex, Ali, and married him barely three months later. Haroon didn‚Äôt ask about my husband or how I was doing. Instead, his eyes lingered on my left hand, where I should‚Äôve been wearing a ring, and he quickly put two and two together.

We talked for a bit longer. I asked about his cousins, and he told me they still ask about me. He then said, ‚ÄúIf you ever need anything, don‚Äôt feel like you can‚Äôt call me anymore,‚Äù before handing me his number and walking away. The whole encounter left me feeling both nostalgic and confused.

I could totally be misreading this and maybe he feels sorry for me which was why he was so nice. I think I‚Äôm also processing my divorce, I mistook him being nice to me as him wanting to rekindle things.

Since I ended things, I doubt we will ever rekindle.

1j1w3jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1j1w3jg/pc_applications_freezingunresponsive_after_using/,PC Applications Freezing/Unresponsive After Using Them,"**Explanation of the Issue:**

Hello all! I'm fairly new to the PC troubleshooting world and understanding all of the parts and such and ran into an issue where after I boot up my PC and click into applications, whether Settings, Firefox, Discord, File Explorer, etc., that it freezes for a few seconds to a minute before responding. This most notably happens when I click into or switch between applications, such as if I open (or switch between files in) File Explorer, or switch Discord channels. When I'm typing in the same text box on the browser (such as this post), no issues at all. 

**PC/Issue History:** 

This specific issue began directly after I opened my PC and took it apart due to an even bigger issue: I was having frequent computer crashes as well as being stuck in a boot-up loop, where the ASUS screen would spin endlessly, shut off, attempt automatic repairs, and crash. When conducting any checks by sfc /scannow, it would have some errors that were resolved, and work for a few days before crashing and having the same issues all over again. 

My initial suspicion was a corrupted Windows 11 install, so I attempted to do a full wipe and fresh install from USB. When attempting this, I got to the installation phases and it continued to crash mid-install. After that, I figure I man up and take a look inside of it so I took it apart and watched a few videos to understand all of the parts. The only thing out of place that I noticed was when I took the CPU out, it looked like the thermal paste was crusted on, so I cleaned it with 91% alcohol and a coffee filter and put a drop of fresh paste. Following this, I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk booting the PC up after it failed an install/wipe, so I booted from USB and just did a full wipe anyway to avoid potential issues with the install. Now, my computer boots up incredibly fast, but I'm experiencing the problems as stated above. 

**The request:**

I'd love some advice on parts that I should look at testing or replacing altogether. As I mentioned, I'm pretty new to the PC troubleshooting world, and have a friend coming over next week to take a look himself, and will probably end up going to a repair shop as well to get their thoughts if I can't figure it out. I really enjoy learning new things and would love to be more knowledgeable through this. Thank you to anyone taking the time to read this and for this forum's past responses and threads that have helped me learn! :) 

If there's any questions anyone has about the PC or other information I can give, let me know! I may ask for some clarification though so I apologize for that.

Since leaving, I‚Äôve felt‚Ä¶fine with my choice. I always say ‚ÄúI may not be religious but I respect your stance. I just want to live my life in peace‚Äù. My family doesn‚Äôt like this, and I have an older sister who makes many snarky remarks about how I‚Äôm just angry at God. I don‚Äôt consider myself an angry atheist. If anything, truly, I‚Äôm a sad atheist. I miss the connection. I miss the rituals. I miss the community, and oddly enough I miss wearing beautiful long skirts and the veil I once owned. 
I just can‚Äôt rationalize going back. 

I‚Äôm married to a wonderful man who is also an atheist. He is everything to me. No, he would never stop me from becoming Catholic again. If I said I wanted to go to Mass he would probably ask questions but he‚Äôs made it clear to me that my choice is mine and he respects me. I just refuse to make the decision without him. We‚Äôre a team.

A few months back, we met with a nice Christian couple who wishes to convert us from atheism to Protestantism (when they learned we were atheists they were insistent on taking us out for coffee to discuss the faith). We let them try but it doesn‚Äôt stick. If anything, I find myself referencing the Catholic Church teachings (which they‚Äôre against because Catholicism is almost its own faith in their eyes) to help them better understand their own talking points. At the end of the day, any arguments they‚Äôve made to me about why I need to choose their specific Jesus just falls flat.

Then, a week ago, my husband and I were talking about wanting a better community. He brought up becoming Unitarian Universalists. I laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be a bad Catholic than join a new church‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why I felt so strongly about it. 
I have researched and heard every argument against God there is. My current viewpoint on the world differs from that of the church. I‚Äôm bi, I have friends that are trans, and I‚Äôm pro choice. I‚Äôd be the worst Catholic ever. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm welcome.

Still, I‚Äôm having dreams of the church, so vivid it‚Äôs disturbing. Prayers are starting to intrude my thoughts when I go to sleep. I haven‚Äôt said a Hail Mary in so long and I thought of it last night. I feel an inexplicable pull to go back. But I can‚Äôt prove anything. I know what I‚Äôve read, I know why I‚Äôm an atheist. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting here. I sincerely hope I‚Äôm not troubling anyone. Thank you for your time. ",1,1740936233.0,Catholicism,5,0.99,False

1j1w2fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1j1w2fr/a_tale_of_valorant_to_be_passed_down_for/,A tale of Valorant to be passed down for generations,"Once upon a time, in a prestigious game studio known as Rito Games, a group of esteemed developers gathered in a dimly lit conference room, armed with coffee cups and questionable ideas. Their mission? To create the most balanced, competitive, and engaging online game the world had ever seen.

""Alright, team,"" said Chad, the lead designer, spinning his chair dramatically, ""we need a deep and tactical system for our players. Something that really encourages teamwork and strategic diversity.""

The room hummed with excitement.

""What if,"" piped up Brad, the combat designer, ""we create a dynamic class system? You know‚Äîdamage dealing characters, and those who assists their teammates! We could have sentinels, initiators, and even healers! Each role with its own strengths and responsibilities!""

""Brilliant!"" Chad exclaimed, slamming his fist on the table. ""Players will rely on each other! They‚Äôll communicate, strategize, and respect each other‚Äôs unique contributions!""

And so, the developers toiled away, meticulously crafting a complex game ecosystem where some characters dished out pain, while others healed, smoked, flashed, and enabled their team to thrive.

Months passed, and the game launched to resounding applause. Players cheered as they clashed in epic battles, each role shining in its own way.


But then‚Äîbrilliance struck.


One day, an executive from HR burst into the office. ""Gentlemen,"" he huffed, ""we need a ranking system! Something to motivate players! Something simple!""

The team huddled together, minds sparking with innovation.

""What if,"" suggested Todd, the intern whose only gaming experience was watching mobile ads, ""we just... rank players based on damage?""

Silence. Then‚Äîgasps.

""Damage?"" Chad repeated, his eyes widening.

""Yeah, yeah! Damage! It's a number! It's easy to track! It goes up! People love numbers going up!"" Todd explained, nearly vibrating from the sheer genius of his idea.

""That's... incredible,"" Chad whispered, as if witnessing the birth of a new era.

""But what about the supports? Those who assists their team through other means?"" Brad asked, though his voice trembled, already realizing he stood in the presence of greatness.

Todd smirked. ""Then they should just do damage.""

The room erupted in applause.

""YES! Why didn't we think of this before?"" Chad exclaimed. ""This simplifies everything! No more messy, nuanced evaluations‚Äîjust one easy-to-understand number!""

""Players will love this,"" Brad admitted, nodding along. ""They won‚Äôt have to worry about meaningless things like teamwork anymore! They can just focus on hitting stuff!""

""Exactly!"" Todd beamed. ""Supports will evolve into damage dealers! Smokers will transcend their outdated role! Every player will be truly equal!""

It was perfection. The update rolled out immediately, and the developers sat back, watching their creation unfold.

Sure enough, players embraced the new system. Healers abandoned healing, smokers abandoned smoking, and teams devolved into mindless brawls where everyone scrambled to boost their personal numbers. It was glorious.

""Look at them go,"" Chad said, wiping away a tear. ""We've created a utopia of pure, unfiltered skill expression.""

""I mean, the game is borderline unplayable now,"" Brad noted, watching as a player threw a post-plant scenario by chasing a few extra points of damage.

""Unplayable? No,"" Chad corrected him, shaking his head. ""It's just competitive in a new way.""

Todd, the true visionary, leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. ""Gentlemen, we have changed game design forever.""

And with that, the team at Rito games basked in their unquestionable genius, never once considering that they had, in fact, **created a stupid fucking system that makes no sense at all**",3,1740936204.0,VALORANT,1,0.8,False

I built this webapp a really long time ago to find coffee shops with Wifi names and passwords in NYC. 

You can access it here: [https://thatsonehotspot.com/](https://thatsonehotspot.com/)

I work in coffee shops a lot and its always annoying to go ask the bartender for the wifi information. Worst, when I buy coffee and find out they don't have wifi there. 

I have collected all the information so far manually. But I think its not the best.   
Plus, I built it while first learning about svelte and this was almost around mid of 2023. 

Any recommendations on how I can make it better, but any feedback in general on whether you would use it and how?

Any feedback would be helpful! Thanks!

1j1vzly,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservativeterrorism/comments/1j1vzly/so_you_want_to_protest/,So you want to protest...,"In a way, yesterday was exactly what we needed, as a country. ""Conspiracy theorists"" have been saying it for decades: America has never been a democracy. Human rights have never been for everyone. Slavery was never abolished (the 13th amendment has a very blatant ""loophole""). We've been hearing it a lot over the last month: ""I'm ashamed to be American."" ""I don't know what to do."" Over the past month, more and more people have realized that we are in an untenable situation. 

But many then get upset when people DO stand up and act. I'll let MLK do the talking for me: 

>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice \[...\]

On reddit, people will say something much shorter: ""Scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds"". A white liberal man once told me that my actions give the movement a bad look. I asked him what actions would be a good look. ""Your chants are too radical."" I handed him the list of chants and asked him which ones made him uncomfortable. He realized my point eventually: that protest makes people uncomfortable. Someone disrupting the status quo makes people uncomfortable. The man had come up to me to silence me, and when he realized that's what he was trying to do, he couldn't stop apologizing. But an apology isn't necessary--your action is necessary. He came to the next protest, which is all we need. If you don't disrupt the status quo, your ""resistance"" has failed. You must make people upset. You are upset, and you need to disrupt their daily lives in order for them to also realize it is time to take a stand. 

That all being said, solidarity isn't just a buzzword. All humans deserve basic rights and dignity. If you do not believe that, then just stop reading. If you are jeering over the plight of minorities, saying ""they deserve it"", then stop reading. The largest Palestinian American community in the country did not have enough anti-Kamala votes to make any significant dent in their own county. Over half of white women voted for Trump. whereas over half of Latinos overall voted for Kamala. Minorities did not do this, and dogwhistling to blame them just means you are trying to absolve yourself of any guilt. 

So what does taking a stand look like? The easiest thing you can do is look up primary sources, learn history/facts, and spread it amongst your networks. You can look up which companies support problematic things, and try to organize natural boycotts. (Some locally owned businesses, for example, may have donated to causes you are not fond of, and you can potentially pressure them into issuing an apology or the like). 

CALL YOUR OFFICIALS. Write them letters. If you can, organize meetings with them. Many of them do not know facts, or do not realize their constituents care. 

Next, go to your own town's city council meetings. They're open to the public. You will see who's actually running your town and what they do with your taxes (spoiler alert: there's a lot of corruption). Some rich person will give a lot of money to a local trustee candidate, then can call in a favor to get a bid on a soccer field, for example.

Okay, we found some corruption. Now, join your local DSA. You may not agree with all of DSA politics, but here's the problem: establishment Democrats are not going to help. You can check out [opensecrets.org](http://opensecrets.org), for example, to see that the same entities pay off both sides. One local millionaire was asked who he donated to. He said, he donated the exact same amount to both candidates. It did not matter to him which one won--both of them would owe him a favor that he could cash in at any time. The same happens in local politics that happens at the state level and the national level. DSA can help you find candidates to support that are NOT paid off--or help you become the candidate that is not paid off. 

Alright, that's not enough, or electoral politics are not for you. What's next? Organize a protest! I've been loving the 50501 movement, as they've been picking very visible days of action that many are seeing. Now that you're connected with a DSA, you'll have a lot of like-minded individuals to show up to your protest. I won't get into the technicalities of how to organize one, especially because it can be varied (noise restrictions, for example). Create a signal chat, or even a discord or a slack for your growing crew. Get someone good with Canva to make you pretty fliers--very important. Organize an ""art build"" (get together with some coffee to make large, visible signs). Get stacks of free stickers from the post office to write your messages on to spread. 

""But it's not safe!"" It is perfectly safe. There are very strict boundaries on what is legal and what is illegal (if you go out into the road, that is illegal). Get yourself a megaphone, look up a list of chants, and then practice/strengthen your lungs in the living room until your family threatens to break your new toy. Bonus points if you only start calling someone on it from the other side of the house when they go to the bathroom. We are fighting against doom and gloom, yes, but you have to find some humor, something to laugh at, or you'll never be able to get out of bed. If you start getting threats or anything of the sort, have your phone on hand to take a video. Especially from cops. If you break no laws, they may not arrest you. And if they do, you have a very nice lawsuit waiting for them. Or if you get a clown trying to run into your crew with a bicycle, just ask him why he's having a bad day, very calmly (no megaphone). He will get huffy and pedal away while cursing at you--no real threat. You have safety in your crew. Go get ice cream afterwards. We keep each other safe. Law enforcement exists to protect capital, not people.

If you don't like a bill that a senator is proposing, and the emails/calls aren't working, find out where they're going to be for a public event and then go with your signs, go with your questions, flood their town halls. 

Be creative. Don't sit on reddit or facebook and hand-wring. 

Get up and take a stand. We're taking back our land.",1,1740936010.0,conservativeterrorism,0,1.0,False

1j1vzcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1j1vzcz/just_finished_my_first_ever_real_jrpg_persona_5/,"Just finished my first ever ""real"" JRPG - Persona 5 Royal. My thoughts and impressions:","Ok so I'm not *completely* unfamiliar with JRPGs - I have played Pokemon games in the past but I've never really delved into a, for lack of a better word, ""real"" JRPG with more fleshed out JRPG gameplay mechanics. I'm not the biggest fan of turn-based combat and although I do watch anime here and there, I find the storytelling style rather off-putting at times.

I've been making an attempt to get into more turn-based games though as I recently played and enjoyed Baldurs Gate 3 and XCOM2. Decided to give a true JRPG a shot and Persona 5 Royal was unanimously the most popular choice for someone looking to get into the genre. SO I went ahead and got the game on my Steam Deck.

This was a few months ago, and I just recently, after about 120 hours, beat Persona 5 Royal.

By and large I honestly loved the game - but it's not without some major issues. 

I'll go over what I enjoyed first:

***Positives:***

\- **The non-combat, ""social sim"" aspect.** Honestly haven't really come across anything like this in the games I usually play and it was a very pleasant surprise. I never thought that I would find living the mundane daily life of a Japanese high school kid so enjoyable but there ya go. It helps that Japan is one of my favourite travel destinations and I've spent a lot of time in Tokyo, so it was a blast to visit a gamified version of areas and landmarks I've personally been in many times. Aside from that though, this part of the game just has such a chill, cozy vibe. I love chilling in Leblanc, making some coffee or curry, or walking around Kichijoji, Shibuya or Yongen, buying random shit and enjoying the atmosphere. Developing relationships with confidants was a really fun part of the game, and I liked how it ties into the dungeon crawling aspect as well. Not all confidants are made equal, and there are ones that I enjoyed more than others (Ryuji, Makoto, Takemi, Yusuke - awesome. Mishima, Iwai, the gamer kid - not so much). The social sim part of the game really makes P5R unique and is undoubtedly my favourite thing about the game

\- **The visual style**. Damn, this game just oozes style from every pore. From the cool af menus and UI, the cartoony art style that still holds up, the transitions, combat animations - it just *looks* absolutely amazing. So much care went into making each piece of the UI not only nice to look at, but also efficient and functional - it's a joy

\- **The music**. Brilliant. From the mellow tunes that play when you're out and about town, to they hype battle themes, the OST really doesn't miss. ""Beneath the Mask"" has become one of my favourite songs from any game ever, and I play it even outside of the game

\- **The combat/Palace gameplay**. I liked it a lot. Again, I'm not a connoisseur of turn-based combat by any means and I assume that P5R, being as popular as it is, likely has pretty accessible combat that's not super-deep. But for me, as someone wading into these waters for the first time, I really enjoyed it. The game wasn't particularly challenging aside from a few sections (FUCKIN' Okumura boss fight) but it's smooth, polished and had just enough depth for me to feel a sense of satisfaction in creating some cool Persona combos and team compositions. I did find that after a certain point I really stopped doing too many fusions or captures and just stuck to 2-3 Personas that worked really well for most combat situations. In terms of level design, most of the Palaces were pretty cool and I enjoyed exploring them. The respawning enemies are a little annoying but hey, free level gains I guess. Was NOT a fan of the Mementos though - they just seemed kinda half-assed excuse for having boring side missions. I get that they had to incorporate them throughout the game because it ties into the penultimate Palace but eh. 

\- **The story.** The story was solid. The concept itself is pretty neat and I enjoyed some of the social commentary. There were some nice twists and turns as well. That being said, the story is also where my complaints with the game starts, and they are as follows:

***Negatives:***

\- **The length and pacing**. Look I know JRPGs by their nature are long, and I'm also no stranger to long single player games - I've spent \~100 hours on RDR2, BG3, The Witcher 3 etc. But good god, P5R is sooooo damn loooong. It just goes on and on and on. Normally I wouldn't mind if the content is mostly compelling but there's just sooo much filler and padding. The text convos and hangouts between you and your Confidants are so completely inane and pointless sometimes, with the same points repeated ad nauseam. Yes I get it guys, you're worried about the change of heart taking place and your anxieties would be understandable if we *hadn't already done this like 5 times in the last few months!* Some of the Palaces are also just not that compelling. Kamoshida's level started the game off on a high but the next 2, Madarame and Kaneshiro, were a little underwhelming. Okumura's whole palace sucked imo, and the Mementos Palace just felt tacked-on and dragged a lot. 

The length really hurts the general pacing of the game. There were quite a few points where the game seemed to drag to a halt with nothing interesting happening. The whole section with the Hawaii trip and Mona throwing a hissy fit was particularly egregious. I really think 15-20 hours could've been cut from the game without it hurting in quality.

\- **The storytelling and dialogue**. While I enjoyed a lot of the story and how it incorporated common human flaws and shortcomings into the gameplay, I found it rather lacking sometimes when it comes to exploring some of these issues in real depth. This is where the game's focus on teenagers and anime storytelling really become stark, leading to the hit-or-miss narrative depth of the different bosses and their Palaces. Kamoshida, Sae and Shido were done really well, but the arcs with Madarame, Kaneshiro and Okumura felt half-baked. There's too much reliance on ""adults are shitty!"" storytelling. 

The dialogue can also be kind of awful a lot of the times. I know exposition and campiness are just part and parcel of anime storytelling but P5R was bad even by these standards. There's a shit ton of cringe dialogue lines and just an absolute metric shit ton of exposition. It really drags the storytelling and narrative down. 

I felt that the story, while generally good, had a lot of under-utilized potential. It could've been a lot deeper and complex.

So yeah I've rambled on for a long time. Those are my pros and cons with the game. Ultimately I did enjoy it a lot, to the point where I'm starting to think of it as one of my favourite 15-20 games of all time. It has a lot of issues but the things it does well, it does *really* well. It's also gotten me excited to delve further into the JRPG world. I think my next game is going to be Yakuza Like a Dragon.",9,1740935995.0,JRPG,4,0.76,False

She doesn‚Äôt ask for much in life other than going to my workshop to run around  everyday and getting to sleep under my chin at night.  Lately she is just crazy to get outside and hunt. Like obsessed with it to the point it‚Äôs impossible for me to keep her in.  She has a billion toys and I even built her a tree structure inside she can play on but it hasn‚Äôt abated her desire. She‚Äôs very smart and knows when I go out to get wood for the woodstove I cannot block her because my hands are full. She also listens for me to come home from work and hides in various spots to make a break. This morning I opened the door to get my cream for coffee and blocked the opening with my legs and fanny and she just jumped on my back and launched herself outside.  

The problem with this is that I live off grid in the woods in a yurt and there are predators everywhere. I have fox, coyotes, bobcats, fishers, owls, eagles and hawks who would love to get ahold of her. I have lost chickens to all of these and bears as well and it will just break my heart into a million pieces if they get her.  She looks like a nice plump squirrel with her coloring and her love of climbing tree trunks. 

Has anyone successfully ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù their cat to become more of an indoor type or it just in her nature to hunt outside? When the weather gets warmer I‚Äôm hoping I can leave her in my workshop to hunt and maybe that will appease her. She does love to be in there and run around all the tools etc.  I‚Äôm worries as spring approaches because all these predators will have their own babies to feed and they get quite aggressive.",11,1740935620.0,cats,5,0.87,False

I got some cheap brazilian beans from a this website: https://www.cafes-pfaff.com/cafes-verts/1666-cafe-vert-du-bresil-cerrado-fine-cup-1kg.html. 


The page has very few info about the coffee but they say it is ""wet processed"". However on the bags I received there is this label, which I guess is a placeholder: https://www.cafes-pfaff.com/cafes-en-grain/1262-bresil-cerrado-panthera-grains.html


This is the label for the roasted version. The altitude is different and they say it is dry processed.


Could you guys look at the pictures and tell me what's the process? I'd say it looks washed but there is not much silverskin in the middle of the beans.

Thanks!

We have a two month old baby. Our baby's birth was complicated and we both had an extended stay in the hospital and during that time my husband had to take care of my dog when I couldn't get a sitter for him. He complained endlessly about it and lead to me stressing about it while I was in the hospital for dangerously high blood pressure. The day I got out of the hospital I was out walking the dog bc we don't have a fenced in yard so when he goes out someone has to walk him and I was so tired of him being pissed off about it I just did it myself when I was days post partum. 

He also complains endlessly and aggressively about doing household chores, and claims he's the only one who does them and it's simply not true. He just doesn't appreciate or acknowledge anything i do.

The main issue is he doesnt just politely ask if I can do the dishes or walk the dog in the afternoon, he does it and then while doing it talks shit about me for not having already just done it myself. He's literally called me lazy and says I just ""sit around"" with the baby all day. He doesnt spend more than 20min at a time with the baby and on the off chance he does bc I had to shower or go grocery shopping he says I've changed x amount of Diapers and had to hold her for X amount of time, like okay? I spend 24 hours a day with her and change 10 Diapers a day. He's never gotten up with her in the middle of the night and when I ask him to take her so I can sleep in the morning he will just change her diaper and plop her back on my chest. I haven't gotten more than 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep in my babies entire life. The other day when I was at my wits end I had to call him bc he left the house to get coffee and go to the smoke shop and had been gone for hours, he didn't take me seriously at all and when he finally got home spent 20min scraping ice in the driveway when he knew I needed help. 

Before we had the baby and were just dating I did the vast majority of caring for pets, cleaning, and did and still do all of the cooking. Now I'm doing 99% of caring for our baby with little to no help, and certainly no appreciation. He's even said we should have another bc ""it's not that hard"" yeah when you do none of the work I'm sure I make it look easy. 

His family is out of state and he can do no wrong in his mother's eyes so they're no help, my parents are over an hour away and both said they'd come by this week and never did. I have no village and don't know what to do. At this point I'm considering divorce but he threatened to ""make me look crazy"" to a judge and take custody of my daughter.

Kids are really just getting leeway to be downright pricks in even the smallest ways, with absolutely zero repercussions, and I‚Äôm absolutely sick of it.

For some odd reason there‚Äôs a lot of tweens/pre-teens in my area that are allowed to roam around the place unsupervised, including my place of work (coffee shop). I wasn‚Äòt even allowed to leave the house on my own and I barely had my own money at their age but it is what it is. Today two girls, no older than 10, come in and queue to get whatever sugary concoction they were in for, and they start chucking these pieces of paper - labels or stickers of some sort - on the floor. This could be a hazard to my colleagues and other customers, so I pick them up and give them a harsh look because I didn‚Äôt know if it was my place to verbally tell them to put their shite in a bin. I continue what I‚Äôm doing, walk back towards them, and they‚Äôre still fucking dropping their shitey wee labels.

I pick them up and make a frustrated ‚Äúwtf‚Äù hand gesture at them, because I was feart to say anything in case they get a higher up on me, and the wee fucks just laugh at me. They litter in my workplace, revel at my frustration, then laugh at me. I‚Äôve been with the company almost three years and no one of any age has ever treated me like this. I‚Äôm willing to bet these little princesses have potentially told their mum about the absolute charades I had to play with them to avoid getting the sack, and my coworkers will tomorrow be hearing all about it from some equally entitled mother.

I recognise I come off as a sensitive wank but I did just want to hide in the back of house for the rest of my shift. I‚Äôve struggled with really bad anxiety the last year, gone on meds and in therapy, starting to come out my shell but still not 100% where I want to be and it‚Äôs things like this that really set me off and cause me to backtrack. I shouldn‚Äôt really let kids ruin my day but as anyone with mental health struggles knows, it‚Äôs purely irrational and not that easy to switch off. I have to work at the weekend to support myself so I can stay at uni and it‚Äôs been destroying me lately (trying to switch to another job), the last thing I need are kids acting entitled and thinking I‚Äôm their personal slave. I‚Äôve had kids in the past laugh at me while processing their transactions, looking at one another and giggling about my demeanour, which is also really distressing and off-putting.

I was diagnosed autistic really young and when I was in school I had to spend a lot of time learning about being polite to others, social norms, how you interact with customer service workers etc, often in a very patronising way. It is absolutely humiliating to think that these weans probably need those life lessons more than I do, without any sort of neurodivergency or other sort of diagnosis, and that it was really all just for nothing.

If you‚Äôre a parent reading this, remind your child of basic fucking manners and if you don‚Äôt trust them to treat other people with basic respect or courtesy, don‚Äôt let them out in public unsupervised. There‚Äôs a reason that we expect folk to be polite to others and it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt know what the actual fuck is happening on their end - ‚Äúbe kind‚Äù is more than just a cute little buzzword.

1j1vdxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j1vdxr/2_months/,2 months,"2 months ago my girlfriend ended our relationship of 10 years after an argument we had.

During these 10 years together, on several occasions her ex boyfriend appeared out of nowhere.... Many times I told her how much it bothered me and made me uncomfortable that he was orbiting our relationship, she always minimized it, and that was enough to keep me calm since I never put her in a similar situation and yet she always thought I liked some woman and I always took care to make her feel safe and calm by showing her the opposite.

2 months ago, in December, a week before the argument, while I was driving, she made me the confession that for a long time she had allowed words to her ex for her to get external validation outside the relationship, she asked me for forgiveness and said that this attitude was wrong. At the time I didn't react, I just thanked her for her apology.

The following week we finished decorating the apartment where we were going to start living the following month, we were in the apartment and were happy with the accomplishment. We were going to sleep at my place that day, we left the apartment and she asked me to stop by her work to finish some unfinished business and then we would come to my place.

I take her to her work and she asks me to stop by her sister's house to pick up her things. I go to the apartment and we make a video call to locate what she needs, we finish the call and I return to her work, entering the parking lot and he asked me if I had arrived yet, I didn't answer because I was literally walking into the office. 30 minutes later I ordered food and 20 minutes later I left the building to pick it up. While waiting for the delivery, I see a man coming out of the building and immediately recognize him, it was the ex-boyfriend, we saw each other's faces, he looked down and I was surprised.

I got my food delivered and go up to the office, we sit down to eat and at the moment I tell her ""guess who I saw outside"" she asks ""who?"" Your ex coming out of the building? She was quiet, then she asked do you know who it is? and I said yes. At that moment she gets up from the chair and says to me, I didn't tell you because I know you will be upset and I answered, if you know why do you do it?..... She remained silent, went to the refrigerator and took out a refrigerated package, that package was the second dose of a vaccine that she needed and she told me I bought it from him because he gave it to me cheaply and at no time did I see him.

At that moment I felt hurt, mocked, deceived, very bad. I got up from the chair upset, she tried to grab me and I told her don't talk to me, don't touch me, I don't want to know anything. I left the office and she chased me to the car, there I asked her to get her things out of the car, in the heat of the moment I told her that we had broken up and why she had done all this to see her ex.

I left and didn't try to talk to her until the evening, calmer and more focused but she didn't want to talk and her answers were Her answers were very dry and cutting. The next day I sought her out in her office and she told me she didn't want me around and to leave.

I spent 2 days trying to talk to her, work things out and nothing. 

On the third day she told me to meet her at the apartment, I was in Caracas and I went down to Guatire to meet her at the apartment where we were going to live, when I got to Guatire I called her to let her know and even though she has a car she asked me to pick her up at her office, which I thought was a favorable reaction to solve the problem.

We arrived at the apartment and she did not say a word, Stonewalled face... I talked, I apologized for my reaction and she only told me that she has apologized me from the same day that things happened, that she did not want to continue the relationship, she had no desire or dream to continue. I tried everything I could until I exhausted myself and surrendered to her decision. She never showed any feelings, just a poker face, she told me if I wanted to take something from the apartment because she was not coming back for a long time. I hugged her and tried a little more and nothing, disconsolate I walked around the apartment and had to tell her that we should leave. I took her to her office, as I said goodbye I asked her to reconsider and no, her mind was made up. She just told me that she loved me and that she had never been unfaithful, then she left.

We were in zero contact for a week, I broke the zero contact for her birthday, I tried not to write her but I couldn't help it, that day of her birthday at 9pm she told me that she loved me and that she had never been unfaithful.

She just told me that she loved me and that she had never been unfaithful, then left.

We were in no contact for a week, I broke no contact for her birthday, I tried not to write her but I could not avoid it, that day of her birthday at 9pm I sent her a message for her birthday and she replied ""thanks, I was waiting for your message"".... After that 3 weeks of zero contact and I decided to look for her in her office, she didn't like me looking there, she asked me to have a coffee. we talked about different topics until we got to our thing and crying she told me that there was no turning back while we held hands, sitting facing each other very close and in moments she looked at my lips as she had always done. That day, she asked me to go on with my life, that I would be able to live without her, she had already decided. Then another zero contact until Valentine's Day, I sent her a bouquet of flowers. She wrote me to thank me, that I should not do it again and that I should let go of us, go on with my life. After that she blocked me on social media and WhatsApp, I haven't heard from her since.

1j1vc46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1vc46,Week 8: Classic Quiche Custard,"I can't believe I pulled this off!!!!!!

This involved a few things I'd never done before: using my tart pan, blind baking, pie weights, and rolling dough is something I'd never really done before this group.

I made the dough on Thursday and wrapped it and put it in the fridge. Then I kept reading about all the troubles people were having with the crust.

Needless to say I wasn't expecting much, I don't have much self esteem with this kind of thing to begin with.

This morning I rolled out the one crust and transferred it to the pan. I cut off the overhang to be even with the top, then got a coffee filter to protect the crust from the beans. 
  I've had dried beans in my pantry for at least a decade, and maybe two. I was very happy I finally got to use them (pinto and navy, for the record)
I filled up the crust to just under the top and baked it for 20 minutes. I used a spoon to remove the beans and then the filter which seemed kinda wet. The crust though seemed perfect? 

No problems with the bacon and onions or the custard, though I did realize later I forgot to add the pepper.

Popped the quiche in the oven and then my son texts that I need to pick him up ""right now"". Got my wife to take it out of the oven and let it congeal a bit before slicing and eating.

I'm gonna try the caprese version tomorrow with cherry tomatoes (recipe says roasted?).

Would I make this again? Maybe. Like most things it seems like a lot of work for something I probably shouldn't be eating in the first place, but my success doesn't make it a no, unlike the phyllo dough",8,1740934425.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,4,1.0,False

1j1vaai,https://www.reddit.com/r/romanceauthors/comments/1j1vaai/about_the_last_6_years/,About the last 6 Years.,"The rains came hard and heavy. The winds roaring through the flooding streets. It was hell on earth. Came home to what looked like a robbery after the water had receded. We did our best to clean it up, we removed the walls. And lived through December when the relief efforts finally came. Young spritely people and old knowledgeable hands worked quickly to repair the damage that had been done. Among the group was a vibrant red haired young woman. She had a long step. When she walked room to room you could almost visualize the vibe in the room become brighter. She was a volunteer running from her own demons to save me from mine. Scared but still so confident and charming. I had no idea that she would be a mainstay in my life.

     We communicated here and there. Over time we ultimately created a romanticized version of what potential life would be like, yada yada yada. The show goes on.

     And then one day, the letters stopped. The calls stopped. And eventually, when the phone rang again, it was her, but the conversation was different. She had met somebody, and wanted me to essentially give her away. So, I did. What else could I do. She had returned home halfway across the country and I was just, here in Jersey watching it all go down. 

   I was living in a small cape cod style bungalow south of Tuckerton. It wasn‚Äôt large. But it was comfortable. I still smell the wood cooking in the fire place. Watching the wind whip the water into frothburgs in the lagoon out back. Broke my heart to sell it but, sometimes luck leaves you no choice. 

      It was about the beginning of February. I had just worked all night out on the ocean. I‚Äôd been working for a disgraced wrestler from the ‚Äúold days‚Äù, who now ran a boat out of a small marina on our island. The Gimmick. And it sure was. What seemed like promising employment turned out to be months of struggle and dealing with an inept man‚Äôs unchecked aggression.
     
      Needless to say, by the time I returned home, not many people were awake. And if you were. There was a reason. Enter Barbara. At 1:30 AM, I‚Äôm doomscrolling Facebook and randomly message somebody. Anybody. Social interaction that didn‚Äôt suck. And there was Barb. Chubby cheeked, ever bubbly Barb. Who would talk to me until we hours of the morning. We talked for a month before we ever hung out. 

     At the time I had been renting a room with about 6 other men at a house in Ocean county. The locals referred to it as ‚ÄúThe Cedar Run Home For Wayward Boys‚Äù. And it lived up to its name. It was dirty and smelled stale. Like someone just cooked a whole skillet of bacon and just let it soak on the stove. Sure, it was totally unhealthy and toxic but, $275 a month for rent didn‚Äôt suck.

   It was another rainy night. I‚Äôm sitting in a black on black Chrysler 300, clove cigarette between my lips and some Randy Travis on the radio. Tattooed biceps hang out of my sleeveless flannel. Back then It was amazing how a low budget luxury car and a tank top made you feel.
I shut off Black Betty, walk inside, and by the time I get there Barb already has tequila shots.

    Eventually the time came to leave. I had to drive her home, but honestly I didn‚Äôt have any of that type of ambition. I just wanted to sleep off my double vision before I headed home.

     When we walked in the front door, the entire living room was taken up by a giant air mattress. 
We turned on a movie in typical fashion, and decided to go to sleep for the night. Kinda. In actuality what happened is I did not watch one second of that Disney film, because I was busy being drained of my life force through my favorite appendage. My god this woman. Continuing on, I wake up in the morning to find a large, bespectacled man staring at me. Then he simply turns and walks away. ‚ÄúRoseanne, Who is this man in our house?‚Äù Before I knew it, I was waking up with a whole family just watching me. 

      Turns out Barb was in town on vacation, and that was her folks house. I ended up dropping her off at the airport like two days later. And we kept in contact, and because I clearly just don‚Äôt know how to set emotional boundaries, we got close. Super close. Just far apart at the same time. 

      Distance seems to be a recurring theme in my life. Everything seems better when it‚Äôs far away and new. Then when you finally get there, after you‚Äôve finally scratched and clawed and rewritten your life to make it happen, it‚Äôs still just that much farther away. 

   After a certain amount of time, the messages became fewer. The calls become hurried and the difference in our lifestyles had just become too apparent to ignore.

     In 2018 I went to Florida. I went to Florida thinking I was going to see some family, get on my feet and really do something great. In actuality I worked part time at a local auto parts spot and really found out who they were. 
    
     My cousin had come up to New Jersey for his wedding. He practically begged me to come down and be my father‚Äôs, mother‚Äôs caretaker. When I got there I realized there was nothing at all medically wrong with this woman. She was just elderly and rude. 

    So, the responsible caretaker that I am, walked myself down to Avis. I rented a car and made it back to Jersey in 10 hours flat. Let me tell you, as a six foot tall man, I implore you not to underestimate the comfort level of the Chevy Cruze. 

  About a month later, I was back to my old lifestyle. I was out until one in the morning. One substance or another, I could take a power nap and be up for three days if I truly wanted to. I became a stand In Security guard for a local music venue. The pay sucked, but it wasn‚Äôt about that. 

    It was about the fact that every time an angst filled singed squelched into the microphone that the whole building felt alive. Each brick felt like lit would expand and contract, letting off little bursts of steam and sweat like an organic machine. The neon light reflecting on the wet cobblestone alley below the bar broken by the immersive flow of people rushing in the door.

     One night after work, a group of local musicians and I began a friendly conversation. Turns out, me and the guitarist had a lot in common. I brought her home that night. She said she was a lesbian but after a fat meal of fried chicken from the local bodega and a couple beers, that was apparently not a complete truth. The next day, I dropped her off at her parent‚Äôs house, but not before a quick hookup in the church parking lot next door.
We‚Äôre still friends.

     After a year or two, I naturally grew out of the party lifestyle. As alluring as nonstop fun is, and getting paid to do it is, ultimately it will break you. 

      About that time I had rented another small house in the same area. It was a little blue rancher with a faded, rusty star hanging on the front of it. I remember when the world shut down. Covid 19 had struck in a major way. Quarantine was put in place and everything just halted. Depression grew.

      Then one day I got an email. 

Empty subject: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to know that you are married, call me if you want‚Äù

-S
     

     I am not, nor have I ever been married.
I had no intention at that point to be or become married. So naturally I was confused and intrigued by this statement. So, I called.

      Sarah, whom I‚Äôd met through the relief efforts from the church, had resurfaced. We talked for hours. And it was like the bond we had had never been lost. Instant magnetism every time. 
We talked and talked about family and life and all that. She had explained that she had had a son, and that she‚Äôd love me to meet him. The list goes on.

        We began making plans toward reuniting, but the distance was just too much for us to overcome at that point in our lives. We were both young. She was a young single parent. And eventually the idea, as grand as it once was, faded away again.

       I didn‚Äôt much have any desire to be involved with anyone. Not for many years after that. I made a promise to myself that I could not in good faith take on a relationship when I simply still have things to overcome.

       It was 2023 and I just needed a change of pace. After a lot of convincing a long time friend and I decided we were going to move ourselves and put frogs into an RV and we were gonna travel. We maid it as far as Georgia. Golden Isles. I was working as a local diver. But they say, you don‚Äôt really know anyone. And after 22 years of friendship, I can honestly say I‚Äôve seen a lot of true colors. But none that ugly.

         I returned home turn of 2024 Homeless. Penniless, alone. Just me and my dog, Frank. But at my lowest, I knew I had some close friends to count on. I bought myself a trailer and worked construction. The simple life was a good life. 

       I like playing pool at the local karaoke bar. Call it what you will. But the entertainment of hearing a bunch of folks having a good time while somehow singing horribly off key just does something for me while I‚Äôm lining up my shot. 

         I walk up and order myself a beer, and notice this woman in front of me. Tattooed, hippy, goth, liquid bliss. I was awe struck. After a couple of words of advice from some friends, I worked up the nerve to go ask her for her number. I don‚Äôt hear back for almost a month.

  Sometimes I wish I didn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm also thankful. 

   This was and is probably the deepest and quickest of connections I‚Äôve ever built with somebody. Because I‚Äôve never been trapped by a sexual narcissist before. Our whirlwind fiery relationship has clearly been toxic from the beginning. We were inseparable. Emotionally, physically, in every way. Our similarities would just multiply day bay day. I loved the way she would lay down across my bed. Using my dog as a tool against me. ‚ÄúKeep mommy company till daddy comes back‚Äù. All that cutesy stuff that‚Äôs totally aimed at emotional control. As much as it hurt to walk away from that, it‚Äôs for the better good. I narcissistic person only makes you feel the way you feel at the top of your game when they‚Äôre draining your energy. Without you, they can‚Äôt recharge and eventually you‚Äôre weary out your own battery trying to feed theirs. 

         We still communicate. We still have love for each other. It‚Äôs just the way things work. 

      As for right now. I‚Äôm Just existing. Me and Frank. Drinking my morning coffee, and reading this email: 

     ‚ÄúHi! Call me‚Äù

Now I'm trying to accomplish this with pure water (some added salt) and black coffee at most. I know some people do their fasts differently as I've read through this sub.

I have done 24 hour fasts every Sunday for 2 months back in July and August of 2024 but I wanna start pushing myself for longer intervals. Hopefully I can work myself to a 72 hour and at most a full 7 day but I'm taking baby steps. Seems like chump change to what some of yall accomplish for sure but it is pretty cool to hear about everyone's journey.

I'm a 31 y/o Latino male, 5'11, and about 200 lbs. I workout 6 times a week, 30 min cardio per day with weight training. I average atleast 11K steps a day and that's even with working a desk job. I'm not a heavy drinker, mainly beer, but each year I try to take atleast 2-3 months off of no alcohol, specifically before and after football season. And during those months I try to push myself in other ways as well, like different workout routines, cutting out specific favorite snacks of mine like hot cheetos, and then last year I added in fasting. 

Overall, I don't think there is a specific reason in doing it other than to push myself and build on my foundation of discipline. However, as I learn more about the health benefits of fasting, it gives me confirmation that I'm moving in the right direction. 

If yall have any suggestions on how to make my fasts more efficient or good studies to read about additional health benefits, I'd be happy to take a look!",9,1740934291.0,fasting,3,0.91,False

Conflicted on how to approach.,"I‚Äôve been tracking my outreach attempts. On average, about 92% of my outreach gets completely ignored, with an 8% first response rate. 

I took a deeper dive into the 8% because I feel like recently almost all of my responses have been people stating they already have an advisor they‚Äôve worked with for ‚Äúmany‚Äù years now. Sure enough, almost 95% of the responses were from someone stating they already have an advisor. 

I‚Äôm unsure where to go from here. I try to stay away from the second opinion trend and I usually congratulate them on recognizing it‚Äôs beneficial to have an advisor. I‚Äôll usually try to ask them questions about what they find great about their current advisor but I hardly ever get a follow up response. 

How are you all playing this space? I reached an all time frustration recently when I met with a prospect for coffee for 2 hours and they spent the entire time telling me about all their assets and retirement goals, just for them at the end to say ‚Äúoh by the way I have an advisor I‚Äôve been working with for 20 years now.‚Äù My counter to that was if he was looking at retirement sooner than later, his advisor probably is too and it may be beneficial for him to start looking for someone who will still be working while he enjoy his retirement. 

All things considered, it was a great meeting. I had a lot in common with the prospect and we have similar retirement goals so I was able to share some ideas I‚Äôve been planning for myself. Was just a frustrating end.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Apologies for my rant!

---

The candles flickered on the low table as Meryem's prospective groom was shown in.

At this stage there was little danger of the wedding being called off. But tradition was tradition, and even with both participants being nowhere near the monarchy arranged marriages were still the rule. Love was fickle and fleeting, no foundation on which to build a proper life together. One did not build a house on sand, after all.

Which was why Meryem was in the kitchen now, preparing coffee for her parents and Ibrahim's family.

Sometimes it was a struggle to find a match. Meryem understood that better than most. She'd been born into a world of silence: sails fluttered noiselessly in the wind, the daily calls to prayer from the local mosque remained unheard. She had never heard the Qur'an read out loud, and she learned the prayers with great difficulty, watching her mother's lips, fingers on her mother's throat and hers to feel out the sounds she had to make.

She hadn't heard the whispers, but she'd seen the looks on her parents' faces, the sneers and tears and pitying glances when people thought she wasn't looking. Her mother used to pray to Allah to show mercy, now she only prayed that her shame not be known. 

So she'd learned to sew, to spin and weave thread, and her family loved her because she was useful. And she wove her prayers to Allah into the mandalas she made, that she might not be a burden on her parents. 

Then Ibrahim had come. Ibrahim, twice her age and missing an eye. Ibrahim, part of the Ottoman court until he'd lost an eye in Wallachia. Ibrahim, who'd learned the language of the mutes at court and began teaching it to her as well.

Mutes were valued there, he told her. They were trusted. When spies lurked around every corner and every whisper could be overheard, it was useful to be able to speak without a voice. 

Meryem's mother was only too glad to have a man interested in taking her daughter off her hands. Ibrahim's parents seemed to feel the same way. No one else would take them, so it only made sense to pair them together. Love would come in time. Beggars couldn't be choosers.

Now, Meryem pondered the tray of cups in front of her. 

Coffee was almost a way of life here. Her brothers went to coffeehouses in the larger towns nearby to talk to girls. She'd been taught how to make coffee as well, back when her mother still had hope for her. 

When Ibrahim had asked Meryem's father for permission to marry his daughter, she'd gotten lessons again. 

She'd added the sugar to the *cezve* beforehand. They'd wanted their coffee sweet, to celebrate a sweet union. Now the coffee rested in five different cups, for both sets of parents and Ibrahim. 

Then, feeling as though she were watching from a great distance, Meryem reached for the salt and cardamoms and dumped as much of them in Ibrahim's cup as she could. 

Why did she do it? She couldn't say, except... she had to know what he was really like. Maybe he only wanted to marry her out of pity, or because no father would want a one-eyed man for his daughter's husband. He was always kind to her, but she couldn't make him happy all the time. Eventually something would go wrong. She knew this well.

How would he react to this?

She stirred Ibrahim's coffee with rapid motions. The coffee was still hot and steaming from the *cezve*, and the salt all dissolved in moments. Heart pounding, she brought the drinks out, carefully placing the cups in front of each guest.

They'd been in the middle of a conversation. Meryem's mother smiled at her.

""Meryem, just in time."" Her lips moved. ""We were just discussing the details of you moving to live in Ibrahim's house after marriage.""

Everyone drank their coffee. Meryem's father smiled, and Ibrahim's parents nodded their approval.

Ibrahim raised his cup to his lips.

His eyes widened, but only for a moment. Soon enough he set down his empty cup and reached for the *lokum* she'd prepared.

""Good coffee, eh?"" Ibrahim's father said.

Ibrahim nodded. ""Yes, very good. Meryem has a gift for it.""

But even as his hands appeared to be occupied with the sweet treats at the table, they said something else to Meryem. 

<Interesting flavor.> 

<I'm sorry,> Meryem signed, hand movements small and quick as she knew how while still being comprehensible. <I wanted to know if you...>

Her hands dropped to her sides. She shouldn't have done it. She'd been blessed with this chance to marry and stop burdening her parents, and she'd ruined it with her foolish desire to test her future husband.

""Don't frown, Meryem. I'm sorry,"" her mother was saying to Ibrahim's parents now. ""Meryem's not usually this glum. She'll do her duty as a wife with good cheer, I'm sure.""   

Ibrahim said something. Everyone nodded, but she paid no attention to their lips. She was looking at his hands.

To her and only her, his hands said, <I love you.>

Meryem smiled.  

""There's a good girl,"" Meryem's mother said. ""Be happy with what you have.""

""Yes, mother,"" Meryem said. It was difficult to form her mouth and voice in the right way, but it was what was expected.

With her hands, sure and steady as her voice never could be, she gave her reply to Ibrahim.

Just enough to dampen the pads. Then they pass those pads over the floor. Lightly. 

To me that‚Äôs a joke. It would be like wringing all the  water out of a sponge mop, then holding only the tip of the handle with two fingers, then pulling the mop behind you as you run across the room. 

I have dogs that track in dirt and mud. Which then dries. It‚Äôs visible and it builds up in minutes. I need a machine that can really get the floor wet enough, turning the dried mud back into wet mud, then take a dozen passes across it to remove it, and constantly rinse out the pads so it‚Äôs not just smearing mud everywhere. 

A machine that will use a camera to identify if it‚Äôs actually finished washing the section that it‚Äôs working on and keep going until it has, perhaps by being trained on what that area looks like when it‚Äôs clean and using that to determine if it‚Äôs dirty. 

I don‚Äôt live a tv commercial housewife in a pleated skirt with sparkling teeth life that spills a drop of coffee on the floor then twirls around to the camera looking all pikachu shocked and a cheeky grin.  I have dirty floors. 

I‚Äôve been holding out for years watching the design evolution of these robot floor cleaners: 
- Rotating discs seem intuitively more effective than flat semi-moistened pads
- machines that boast about downward force clearly tell me that they‚Äôve acknowledged the need for effort
- Base stations that can be plumbed in, ensuring a constant fresh supply of water and the ability to drain filthy, gritty water and not clog up from sediment also seems hopeful. Provided the machine exploits this by constantly cleaning itself
- a vacuum that‚Äôs smart enough to keep working on a floor until it‚Äôs actually clean and not just assume that a standard one or two or three pass pattern is good enough.

She had an extremely cool corner unit apartment on the 30th floor with incredible views of the city, including two rivers and a major bridge. 

She said her practice is fully booked 6 months out, so she's obviously doing well. 

She was hot as fuck. It was a ‚Äúdark spirit and evil creatures‚Äù themed costume party and she wore a little black dress with slits all the way down the side, going as a vampire with a choker and a tiny little vial of blood which she said was her own blood that she drew. She also wore one fang on each canine, red lipstick, long red sharp- looking nails, and was wearing red colored contact lenses. I asked her what color her eyes really were, and she smiled cheekily and said ‚Äúwell right now they're red, but if I get my fill tonight they might return to their other color tomorrow morning.‚Äù 

That's when I knew ‚ÄúOk I'm sleeping with this girl.‚Äù 

I dressed up as a devil, which was kind of lame but I already had a costume and it fit the theme. 

I don't like to kiss and tell but I will say the sex was absolutely wild and by far the best of my life. 

The next morning I tried cuddling with her but she was already out of bed. She made me coffee and told me to get dressed. Once I was dressed, she said ‚ÄúLook, last night was fun but I can't be in a relationship right now. The work I do is very stressful since I work with a lot of really troubled individuals, and it would bleed over into a relationship if I ever got into one. Plus, we already had sex so your interest in me should be pretty much gone.‚Äù 

She then kissed me on the cheek and told me she already called me an Uber and it would be here in 10 minutes.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j1urn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1j1urn8/dear/,"Dear *,","You'll probably never read this, and honestly? I sincerely hope you never read this. So, welcome to whoever is reading this, and feel free to take on this long ride. Just warning that it can get cringey tho
---------------------------
You never stopped being a Star to my eyes, and in the past few months that we've been apart has showed me that your light has only gotten brighter and brighter. 

I still remember the first few months when all contact we had, albeit brief and fleeting, was filled with excitement and joy. I never thought I'd connect to someone like you, and I'm happy I did. We weren't together then, if we were ever actually together at all... We never dated officially, nor did we come out to our parents for support. Nevertheless, we were happy. Just seeing you walk past me or enter the same room left me breathless with how much my heart was pounding against my chest. It was like I chugged five shots of coffee in one go all over again, minus the puking part of course.

I loved your notes and letters. I kept them with all my old school stuff. Your handwriting was a mess but your words never failed to make me smile or even laugh a bit. I remember when we would stay up late until around midnight consecutively for a few days just so we could message and get to know each other. More often than not, you'd be the one ending the conversation and I would spend the rest of the time rereading our conversations until my eyes were tired.

I wrote poems about you, though I never explicitly mentioned your name. To me, you were Aster. The idea came to me when I realized that asters were your birth flowers, and I thought it fit perfectly cuz aster is Greek for 'star'. Is it kinda cringe? Welp, there's that. 

I kept the pen you gave me for my birthday, but I stopped using it after the refills ran out of ink. Some weeks ago you approached me about wanting to give me some refills if I'm out. I denied your offer and told you that I'd just buy them on my own. The truth is, I can't bring myself to use the pen without thinking about you, so I just kept it in the drawer under my desk and never bought refills. 

I'm happy for you, you know? The past months that we separated looked good for you- you pulled your grades up and were able to get acknowledged by so many people for your achievements. You got better at your passion, badminton, and became one of the top players of our batch. You're amazing. So amazing, while I'm just here. My grades didn't recover from when we separated, and I've only dug myself a deeper hole for social suicide. Things haven't been so good on my side, and I'm a bit bitter that you've moved on and climbed higher while I keep sinking. 

Graduation is getting closer, faster than ever, and I really need to take my chance to get myself a concrete path to my dreams. I'm thankful for all that you've been to me, and I think it's time for me to move on. You can't be the only one reaching your dreams, right? I need to take my chances to do better, to grow.

I've tried letting go before but I kept failing, over and over again. My best friends will tell you so. It's caused them a few headaches and some curse words. I have so much to make up for to my grades and to personal growth.

You will always be a Star, but I don't think you can be my sole Star any longer. It didn't work out for us, so I'm letting you go now. It will take time for me to be able to fully get over you, but I will do my best to move forward.

There are so many other stars in the night sky... Maybe one day, I'll finally find my North Star.


I wish the best for you and your journey.

1j1ups4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ObjectiveAlarming933/comments/1j1ups4/the_fry_incident/,The Fry Incident,"Ughhhh. Just woke up and made coffee. 
We have a party thing for some movie awards thing today. We are hosting. I‚Äôm not into it and like, hella annoyed but this is a big deal for my partner so I am just‚Ä¶ trying to not shit on it. 
It‚Äôs hard because if he wants to have people over on the weekend, it‚Äôs kind up to me to clean the place up. It‚Äôs up to me the clean it regardless but when it‚Äôs just him and me, I can turn a blind eye to certain chores until I can‚Äôt anymore. (My threshold for living in messy spaces is not very high. I like to live in really tidy spaces. But it‚Äôs really hard to work, and clean up after 2 adults and 2 cats). On weekends, I want to be left alone and I don‚Äôt want to do ALL THE CHORES. For this event, I also have to walk down to the fish market and get halibut because we are having fish tacos. So where in this span of time I have to put makeup on and get presentable. Yesterday I found out that the awards show is 4 fucking hours long. I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs unreasonable‚Äù in response. Lol how do people dooo this omg?! 
4 hours?! That‚Äôs the whole day! Ugh. 
To make matters worse, the people who are coming over are part of the six pack; the wives in the group are the wives I went to the show with and I am still kind of recovering from that. 

I think from now on, if there is an important event, I am going to go alone. I really wish I had just gone to the phantogram show by myself. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt love the ladies who went with me, I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to be fuckin bossed around. I‚Äôm finally ready to kind of talk about what happened. 
So basically, we met at this crazy goth restaurant that I have been really excited to visit. It‚Äôs horror themed and you can walk around after your meal to look at the different horror themed displays. It‚Äôs actually a riot and I can‚Äôt wait to go back. 
Anyway, myself and the girl who picked me up arrived at the restaurant early. We were talking and catching up and it seemed to be going well, even though later on I felt really terrible about how everything that I say about my life comes out as bitching. My friend asked what I was getting and I said ‚Äúvegan wings and fries‚Äù. She said ‚Äúshrimp and fries‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. When we ordered I did not hear her order fries but I didn‚Äôt think anything of that either. When our friend sat down my friend rattled off that she ordered the fries and I was kind of checked out so when it was my turn to share what I was ordering I said ‚Äúand I got the vegan wings and fries as well‚Äù. My friend cracked up and said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get fries because we are sharing‚Äù. 
And then I laughed because I realized I had missed her telling me that like 4000 times. 
When the food arrived, I actually needed to eat dinner. I‚Äôd eaten lightly all day so I wouldn‚Äôt have a tummy ache at the show. I used to just starve myself prior to events so I wouldn‚Äôt have a tummy ache, but by the time the event rolled around, I would be in so much pain and so gassy and bloated that I learned I need to eat just a little bit to avoid the tummy ache. 
So, the food gets set down in front of us and honestly, all I wanted was the fries. Shrimp grosses me out. It‚Äôs officially on the ‚Äúno‚Äù list for me. It was pending in status for a long time but I‚Äôve officially decided that it‚Äôs gross. So I was not going to eat their shrimp. They ordered artichoke dip but it was too garlicky and that is a formula for ibs girl to DIE at the concert, and it‚Äôs very rude to eat garlic before a show. lol 
I just wanted the fries. My friend said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh and Cassandra will have the fries entirely to herself‚Äù. Which was puzzling to me for so many reasons. Why would I order fries if I didn‚Äôt want to eat them? Why would I order food at all if I wasn‚Äôt hungry or didn‚Äôt need to eat? And then the MOST FUCKING BAFFLING THING IN THE FUCKING WORLD HAPPENED. My friends just picked at the food. Like, they literally only had a few nibbles. And then THEY STOPPED. You could barely tell that we had eaten. I paid close attention to how they ate because I have noticed this behavior before. They make an enormous deal out of getting snacks and drinks but then they barely eat. At all. Is this a protocol that I am unfamiliar with? Am I a gremlin? Admittedly, I‚Äôm like double the size I was when I first moved here‚Ä¶. But. wtf?! Are they doing that church lady thing where they try to show you how to eat like a lady and not get fat? Am I being church-lady‚Äôed?
The fries went untouched. I had like 4 and everyone watched me reach across the gd table like an ogre to get them. It became so uncomfortable that I just decided to eye fuck the fries instead. 
This custom of eating together is unfamiliar to me and I feel like a fat ass. Well I am a fat ass. But in the wild (the lady wild. The church lady wild) the women would assert this type of pressure on each other to not eat and to not gain weight. Someone was always keeping a watchful eye on what I ate so I wouldn‚Äôt get big. They were always like‚Ä¶ making sure that the little girls didn‚Äôt eat too much so we wouldn‚Äôt get fat. It‚Äôs been a long time since I have lived in this culture and it really took me by surprise to see my friends still do it. It made me miss my friend M who is constantly eating. 
I‚Äôm really struggling with my self esteem as of late. I have gained a lot of weight from inactivity and binging from stress. But it‚Äôs my issue. Why would anyone else care about how fat I am? Why would they try to embarrass me like that? Do we not live in Portland where FUPAS and crop tops are practically a uniform? 
When the check came, instead of waiting for my friend to answer the waiter, I just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the fries and the vegan wings‚Äù. (The vegan wings were really gross. I ate three and abandoned ship). 
The rest of the night was spent in absolute bewilderment and shame. I put it aside so I could enjoy the show (nothing was going to get in the way of me enjoying that show. I even bought two shirts. A little treat to myself since I couldn‚Äôt eat any fuckin fries). Should I have paid for my friend‚Äôs food since she picked me up? Was I missing something there? I don‚Äôt eat shrimp. I didn‚Äôt touch her food. I tried the artichoke dip twice but it was also yucky. The FRIES WERE THE ONLY THING THAT I EVEN LIKED. Argh. More importantly, what was the point of getting food if we weren‚Äôt going to eat it? I wasted $30 on food. I don‚Äôt drink, one of us is sober curious and one of us is a normie who drinks but drinks‚Ä¶ normally so‚Ä¶ knowing that‚Ä¶ drinks couldn‚Äôt have been the purpose of going to the restaurant. PERHAPS THEY DID GET FULL OFF THE NIBBLES. Which sets me into a whole ass shame spiral. I miss my friend, R who sat with us at the Xmas party a few days before. She eats every last bite of her food and offers commentary on the whole thing. I fuckin love it. And I love her. She unabashedly licked her plate last year at the farm to table dinner we went to. I‚Äôve had her cooking at the beach house, she‚Äôs an amazing cook. She knows food. It‚Äôs an experience for her. The friends I went to she show with, aren‚Äôt great cooks. Their food is fine, but they don‚Äôt fuck it with their mouths and it shows. You can really tell who loves food based off their cooking. Anyway. 
So I am in a spiral about my weight and social eating customs. I‚Äôm struggling with hating my body and conversely trying to reign in the binge eating. I changed my diet after the show. I cried for way too long and way too hard. I don‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore. It‚Äôs a whole thing whenever I leave the house. I‚Äôve even been buying clothing for this sized body, so that I feel comfortable and I feel like I look nice even though I hate every inch of my body. But that‚Äôs not helping either. I just feel like a huge disgusting fat hog. 
My partner said I looked ‚Äúhot‚Äù when I left the house but in hindsight, I wish I had worn something less‚Ä¶. Outfitty. I thought I looked cute when I left the house but then I just felt silly after the Fry Incident. I saw photos of myself afterwards and was mortified. 

So I guess today, I will just nibble at my fucking food like the six pack girls.

After an intense game my opponent threw the towel saying something like ""I'm tired"" (according to Google translate) and resigned... The win felt undeserved honestly.

Would I have won eventually? And can someone give me some pointers what I should have done better...low hanging fruit preferably.  
Please, all respect to my opponent I was in the ropes the entire game and I felt sorry that he had to resign.

That was my favorite drink the whole time it was out. Before that, my fave was iced gramma nutt latte. I don‚Äôt have a huge interest in any of the current drinks. I was *really* excited about the lucky charms one but I was super underwhelmed. I didn‚Äôt taste marshmallow at all. It just tasted like a basic sweet iced coffee. If I could get extra marshmallow syrup, I would, but I prefer ordering ahead on the app and it doesn‚Äôt have the option for extra marshmallow syrup. I‚Äôve been getting the iced caramelicious and trying different syrups added to it (I‚Äôve tried - at separate times, not all at once - vanilla, hazelnut, and just doing extra caramel syrup). They‚Äôve all been ok but just not as good. Any suggestions? 


I tried the iced cinnamon brown sugar oat milk latte and I liked the cinnamon brown sugar flavor but I think oat milk always adds a weird taste to coffee. I prefer almond milk in my iced coffee. Would it be weird to get that drink with almond milk? Even though it has oat milk in the name? üòÇ
