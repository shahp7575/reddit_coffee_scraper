1ods51a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ods51a,NYC- Hotel Seville Nomad,"
Trip: Family of 4, 4 nights in NYC 

Hotel Goal: Hyatt with a guaranteed suite upgrade OR a room with two queen beds.

Current Findings:

Two queen beds seem to be the Hotel Seville and 2 Hyatt Centric. Picked Seville for a lower price.

The room is spacious for NYC, with:
  · Adequate floor space for luggage.
  · A small dining table.
  · Room to walk around comfortably.

The breakfast is cooked to order with a small menu. The waiter will check if you are Globalist. Technically, globalists will get one entree and one coffee/drink. Practically, the breakfast is waived as a whole in the final bill inclusive of tips and any extra or additional entries.

This is a pretty good deal, compared to Hyatt Centric in New Orleans which deducts the exact $35 for individual. We had two different waiters/waitresses during the four-night stay. One always automatically charge 18% for the breakfast, while the other one only charges the breakfast as shown. Inconsistent practices. I do notice that some guests got surprised by the question of ‘globalist’ as they wonder if they actually are. 

Eggs in camicia is pretty good! 


A small gym but well equipped with weights, rowing machine and one treadmill. 

The hotel is right next to bus stop M1/2/3. You can easily get to Mets museum, Central Park or Library, or SOHO. The whole foods market is right around the corner. Or Hashi Market, an interesting Japanese grocery store. K-town is two blocks away where abundant Korean and Pan-Asian food is available. 

A Lyft/Uber to airport is around $58-65.

1ods306,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ods306,24 shielded CAT6a retrofit! Took 3 weeks- (4 days per week),"Ok this is my biggest retrofit but not the biggest home. My approach was knock out the easiest runs first, this way I could learn more about the home and attic while still making progress.  This home didn’t have a crawlspace and 1/3rd of the runs were on the first floor while the rack was on the 2nd floor.  I had to cut a few access holes (all at outlet height from the floor above) and then do some wild drill shots.  I ran pull string for every location and found some very useful dead space for other pulls. I used every tool in my bag. Customer is very happy, and I’m happy it’s over.  Spent 1 week drilling, fishing walls, and adding pull string, I only spent 1 day pulling all wires back to the rack, and the. spent 2 days back feeding wires to more complicated areas, then spent one day terminating and testing, then one last day mounting devices. Customer bought his own equipment, I was just there to route wires and install. I will say this is my biggest job in residential, and beats the 16 drop record that was previously being held by a famous YouTubers/streamers home I did 2 years ago. I actually filled a Patch panel and only 3 locations were duals.  Ok I’m going to sleep- enjoy the pictures - of course my Apple vision was used for all drops -  it helped me figure out paths, efficiently route wires, find dead space and I didn’t need a helper until it was time to pull wire, all drill shots were done with my headset on. I needed a job like this to test my limits, now my usual 3-6 drop jobs will be small to me, and I’ll be more confident when quoting and selling my abilities. Not to mention we just had a newborn so I was doing all of this while running on fumes because I’m up helping with the feedings every 3 hours. Oatmeal and Coffee for breakfast, rotisserie chicken for dinner, hour drive to the customers home- thats been my life for 3 weeks. It’s over now.  Back to reality- posting on Reddit lol

Since then, through reading up more on it and speaking with some folk here and learning more about the term, I now know I am asexual. Anyway, without further ado, here's my post:

Meeting someone the old-fashioned way isn’t in the cards for me, so I’m here to find my other half (the better half) and life-partner who also wants to be part of a monogamous partnership built on emotional availability, the right chemistry, kindness, and shared purpose. If this post resonates with you, contact me if you also want to lead a healthy, productive, chosen-family life together.

About me: I’m a 28-year-old male, straight, born and raised and currently located in India. I’m of mixed Asian-European (“Anglo-Indian”) descent. I have a Christian background though I’m irreligious, and speak English as my native-first language. I’m 5’8”, work out regularly (recently went through a weight loss journey), and live a health-conscious lifestyle so I don’t smoke, drink, etc.

Interests-wise, my oldest love has always been photography (film photography too once I get the time), the cinema, listening to music (my playlist's link is on my profile, please share yours with me too), theatre (ask about that time I saw an Italian-operatic production of Macbeth in Vienna), traveling (all the time, really), having (way too much) coffee, reading (mostly non-fiction all my life), learning & speaking languages (English native, 3 others), writing (both as a hobby and now professionally), comedy (it’s an art-form truly, and any partner of mine has to have a sense of humor, sorry, but this is a non-negotiable), checking out new cuisines in new restaurants, visiting cafes, museums, galleries, and libraries, being out in nature in parks and trails, and listening to history or popular-science podcasts especially as background noise while working and/or writing my master thesis.

It’s okay if your hobbies and interests are different; that way, we’d both be introducing one another to a diverse range of activities and pastimes for the rest of our lives. I understand the need for space as well, it’s okay to make changes and tune our individual lifestyle presences to vibe together as a couple.

I wouldn’t want either of us to plateau. I’m open to marriage and open to relocating for or with my future partner as I’m rather serious about settling down, and not engage in endless texting & casual dating.

I’m not posting here looking for a penpal where we would just be light on a screen for each other. If we don’t exist together in reality, then we’d just be in love with ideas of one another, not our real selves. So it’d be great to bridge the gap if see ourselves living a shared-future together.

Honestly? Just hope that we really like each other and our goals in life are aligned. That's really all that matters the most.

I believe that not everything has to be perfect. Some differences & red flags are expected, and as long as we’re willing to work on ourselves, on each other, and we’re both willing to put in equal effort into the relationship & keep our word & make no sudden 180s. There's way too many over-complications in today's day & age with the amount of dating options and thinking we're better off alone which leads to all this loneliness everywhere experienced by everyone, that all can be eradicated through simply zeroing in and matching on the essentials and working everything else out along the way.

So, yeah... If what you’ve read so far resonates with you, it’d be lovely to hear from you. If we connect, it would be great for us to both share selfies so we have an idea of who we’re talking to.",1,1761187235.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

Women on my dad's side consistently get them, and my mom's side has other hormonal issues.  
  
In middle school, I’d get them 3+ times a week (usually triggered by hunger, poor sleep, stress, or strenuous activities) but they’d go away with rest. In high school, after we moved states, I started getting barometric pressure headaches on top of the migraines. Sleep stopped helping, and I began seeing blind spots and floaters on bad days. I became extremely sensitive to light and sound, which would make me nauseated. If I didn't have a migraine, I had a dull headache or brain fog. 

A doctor once gave me samples of three prescriptions, but none worked.   
  
Anywho, over time painkillers stopped helping, so I just learned to manage. We suspected food was a factor. Some headaches eased after eating (especially during cross country season), but others got worse, which was confusing.

Recently, I noticed I rarely get migraines anymore—maybe 1–3 times a month, and they’re manageable with food, sleep, or painkillers. The turning point was realizing that sugar was a major trigger. If I eat sweets right after a meal or without protein/fiber, I get a migraine. Now I pair sugar with protein, move more after meals, and avoid binge eating. I don’t track blood sugar, but this shift lines up with when I shifted my sugar habits. I still eat a ton of sweets, but now I spread them out differently. 

Further proof for this was after an elimination diet (for psoriasis and migraines) I drank flavored lattes and got dull headaches but could drink plain coffee or tea with milk without any issue. I was so used to these headaches that I didn't realize how frequently I had them because they were pretty much constant. Making sure I don't have a flavored latte on an empty stomach or getting it half-sweet has been a good alternative. 

TLDR: Being mindful of blood sugar has cut my migraines from 3+ times a week with constant dull headaches, to just a few times a month with no aura or nausea.",1,1761187118.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

1odrvy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/frogs/comments/1odrvy3/allergy_to_tadpoles/,allergy to tadpoles?,"Hi fellow frog lovers!

I hope you can offer some input on this.....

In late July an acquaintance found Grey Tree Frog tadpoles in her gardening bucket.  I've raised tadpoles before, so I said I'd take them.  So I've had about 50 tadpoles in three bowls for about 3 months.  I lost 4 tadpoles, but have successfully released 37 froglets so far.  I really love the little dudes!

I've had some kind of allergies or sinus infection since spring, meaning it started before the tadpoles, which has caused my eyes to be swollen, sinus headaches, which have gotten worse.  Recently I've even developed breathlessness, so I'm worried about a respiratory infection.  I'm taking an antibiotic that doesn't seem to be helping.  I have an appt with an allergist in a few weeks.

The tadpoles didn't start this, but I recall the last time I raised tadpoles I developed allergy symptoms.

I never touch the tadpoles, but I do hover over the bowls closely every day as I use a turkey baster to suck up waste, feed them and add fresh water, so I have respiratory contact with their water and waste.  I transport the froglets to release sites in a styrofoam coffee cup, but never physically handle them.

I'm wondering cause I just read that Grey Tree Frogs release toxins that can irritate eyes, lips and skin, but haven't read tadpoles do.  Has anyone here had new or worsened allergy symptoms or respiratory infections that could be related to raising tadpoles?

I originally planned to check out the Ginza location since it aligned with other plans nearby, but when I saw the line there around 11am, I decided to take a chance on their newest Tokyo location instead. That gamble paid off—no line, and we got straight to the coffee.

The coffee was excellent, and the experience lived up to expectations. Now I understand the hype. That said, both before and after Glitch, I visited numerous other coffee shops in Tokyo and some offering equivalent quality and taste. Few even provide the same experience of selecting beans at the counter and watching baristas work with those fancy drippers and frozen titanium balls.

So is Glitch overhyped? I don't think so, but it's important to understand what you're getting. It's like going to a high-end restaurant, just for coffee. This isn't your daily coffee shop where you pop in on your way to work. It's a destination where you gain access to exceptional beans—the kind used to win barista championships—with origins and quality you won't find at your grocery store or even most ""regular"" coffee shops. More importantly, it's where that coffee will be prepared with an exceptional degree of skill. And yes, that comes at a premium price.

Coffee, like many things, is somewhat personal, and we each have our own preferences. Those preferences evolve with experience, and visiting Glitch just might influence yours. Was my mind blown?

1odrpnc,https://i.redd.it/6sq7awk3vrwf1.jpeg,The Fox Den under my House,"I knew opening my house up to a stranger was a mistake from the beginning, but I wasn't exactly unfamiliar with making mistakes. After all, that's what got me that position in the first place. 

I'd just had a pretty rough breakup. Lots of red flags that I just ignored. I won't name any names here, but I eventually caught on that he was never actually going to rehab. He was actually going even harder on the meth and screwing other guys behind my back. Again, lapses in judgement, far too trusting, really fell for his sob stories. It all came crashing down when I found out he was inviting his junkie fuck-toys to my house while I was away at work. I felt myself sinking far too late to stop it.

By the end of the affair, I was just thankful he was out of my house and my life, and that the junkies had stopped showing up.

But reality does have a way of creeping back in. My reality was that I couldn't afford the repayment on the house and the lot rental. The only way I did was back when I rented one of the rooms out to George, one of my best friends - one my Ex tried to convince me to kick out with the promise he'd ""eventually find the right job"" for himself and help cover it. He just ended up doing it himself by pushing his buttons, George had always been kind of a hothead. Just came home one day to find out he'd moved. Ex turned it into his own personal achievement.

So I turned to the safest options for finding someone I could trust as a roommate: Craigslist and a posting on the classifieds board in the IGA. I don't mess around with Facebook or any of that shit, and I didn't have time to go around and try to mend bridges with old friends. It wasn't like I could do any worse, right? 

After a few weeks of radio silence, he showed up at my front door. Once again, multiple red flags. Really unkempt, long hair, somewhere between a greasy Jesus and Rasputin. His clothes seemed to be a weird mix of far too small or far too large, brand new and threadbare. His shoes looked like he'd never taken them off. He stunk, but smelled kind more... dirty. Like actual dirt, dirt soaked with old sweat. His eyes were freaky. Green, but, like... most people with green eyes, they're a mix of brown and blue and *mostly* green, which is completely normal. His were the purest emerald-green I'd ever seen. Or maybe it was just the wide-eyed stare that made them look like that, I can't say.

""Hey man, can I...?"" I started to ask, when he slowly held up the print-out I'd put up at the IGA. I'd taken the time to cut out the little tabs at the bottom with the contact information, and this guy had taken the whole thing. Great, that would explain the lack of calls. ""You're here for the room?""

""Ye-ah,"" came the soft, raspy voice in reply. I'd never heard anyone who could make a single syllable sound like two, the word spoken in separate, almost breathless little huffs. 

""You got the first month's rent? If you'd called ahead I would have offered to show you the place first."" 

He slowly rummaged around in his hoodie pocket, and pulled out a crumpled wad of cash. Reluctantly, I took it. I was pretty shocked when I counted it up - $350 on the dot in twenties, fifties, and a hundred. It all clicked for me at this point. This guy was homeless, obviously, and it was mid-October now. The way it works around here is that bums will live on the streets or in a car during the Spring and Summer, save up all they can, and rent a place for the winter since the shelters tend to fill up too quick. Once the last frost passes, they move back onto the streets to save up again.

I felt a little sympathy for him, right then. I'd never done much in the way of charity or donations. A nod, a wave, a polite conversation, maybe a few bucks doled out. Maybe lending a hand over the winter would be my repentance for that, it wasn't like I had much else to give. He did have the money, after all. Mostly likely would've been stolen or panhandled, but I was desperate. It had been 50-to-60-hour weeks on-end by that point. And if the worst comes to the worst, my bedroom door had a deadbolt keyed separately to the house, and I still kept my dad's revolver on me.

He didn't have any questions while I showed him the place, never said much anyways, maybe just another occasional ""ye-ah"" in a general affirmative. He did have a tendency to stare - at everything, like he was always on edge. Again, he didn't have to be normal, just... stable enough. Told him he was free to use the kitchen and bathroom as long as he cleaned up, I'd respect his privacy if he respected mine, and if I even got the hint that he was doing drugs I'd call the cops - all things I'd made clear on the listing. Again, no rebukes. And that was that, I let him to his own devices and he didn't bother me for the rest of the day. 

Never got a name from him. Never offered one. Came to think of him as ""Hobo Bob"", and I don't *think* I ever called him that to his face. Something tells me he wouldn't have cared all that much if I did. 

Within the week after he moved in, I was out on the porch in the morning with my coffee. I was caught up in worrying about a fluid leak on my car - I couldn't tell where it was coming from or if it was severe enough to take in, and I was sure if I did I was going to get fleeced. I was trying to figure out if I'd be able to make the walk to work in time if it came to it when a noise crackled out of the darkness somewhere, and I ended up dropping my mug. Funny thing, I knew exactly what it was that second, but it still managed to catch me off guard. We'd had foxes that lived around town ever since I was a kid, usually in the outskirts of the suburbs, but sometimes they made their way in town for food. Seeing them was not uncommon, hearing them slightly less so. But this was the first time I'd heard one while living there. A single, raspy scream, and a rustle of leaves somewhere off in the brush. Surprising, sure, but it seemed explainable enough. After a few seconds of silence just to process it, I picked up the bigger pieces of porcelain and went back inside, and forgot about it once I got to work. 

That weekend was one of the first in a while where I wasn't working overtime, getting a little bit of a break in with Bob covering his part of the rent. I was prepared to have to deal with him over the course of the day, a worthy trade-off in my perception. But I didn't see him for most of it - from what I could tell, he mostly went out at night, leaving past sundown and coming back by dawn. In fact, I hadn't noticed much evidence of him living there at all. Occasionally, I heard the faucet in the bathroom running, but never the shower - whatever, up to him. Maybe I noticed a few things missing from the kitchen, but never any dirty dishes or cups or beer cans. The only definite things were the faint smell, and more dirt on the carpet. 

The smell actually might have been worse than I thought, in retrospect. My sense of smell has always been pretty poor since I was a kid, some kind of defect in my sinuses a doctor might've told me at some point. Anything would have to be really strong or really close for me to notice it. It helped at times, meant I could put up with a lot, but it made it easier for me to miss things.

Early Sunday morning, I was folding a load from a laundry run when I heard the front door open and shut, and steps slowly amble across the living room. I kept listening as I worked, and an unnerving thought started to wile its way in. It was one thing to invite some guy I didn't know to move in, but another for me to be living in the same house as someone I almost never saw, let alone knew. I'd expected that getting to know Bob better would have been a give-in, whether or not I liked it. Having a roommate that makes it feel like you're living alone seems like a blessing in theory. Come to think of it, had I seen him again after the first night? Was it even the same person I invited in, or could he have just sold the key to someone else on the streets? It may as well have been one of my Ex's junkie friends out there. I made my way to the bedroom door, and I heard the steps wander near it, coming down the hall. I felt the butt of the pistol in my waistband. I clicked the deadbolt open. The steps ran down the hall. I opened my door, and Bob's slammed shut. 

The sound of another fox call outside woke me up during that night.

Wednesday or Thursday, I got home late from work. I was in the kitchen prepping a Banquet pot pie when the door down the hall creaked open. I looked up. The view from behind the counter is a dead shot down the hall. It was lit only by the light from the living room, leaving the far end in darkness. Nothing, and yet I wouldn't look away. This felt... unfamiliar. It didn't feel like I was looking at a place in my house. Like I was looking down a well. Down into a cave. Into a hole. And I felt like there was something in that darkness, just out of view, staring right back. I stood there, waiting to see who would come into the light. What would come into the light. I felt like I knew it wouldn't move until I looked away. Stop it, I tried to stop myself from weirding out. Relax, it's fine, just act normal and things will be normal. Bob's unusual, but it doesn't help when I get so defensive when he really hasn't done anything wrong, it can only make it worse. I focused back on getting the pot pie package open. The steps started down the hall and into the living room. Something about the cadence made me feel like he was looking at me the entire time.

""Hey, how's things going?"" I kept my voice as casual and non-defensive as possible, casting up a glance towards him, ""You want anything? I can thaw one out for you too."" He *had* been looking at me, but it was still Bob, at least.

""N-ah,"" the only other word I'd heard from him, spoken much in the same way. He continued towards the front door. 

""Alright, you have a good night, man,"" I decided to leave it at that, and he ambled out the door into the night. 

I did notice a few things. Some of the clothes he'd shown up in were significantly dirtier. He had a jacket on over the sweatshirt, now, too. Also dirty, but it still had the store tag hanging off of the cuff - Walmart, from the look of it. That was all explainable enough. The odd part was his hands. I thought he had gloves on at first, but as I thought back on it, I realized they weren't gloves. His hands were completely coated in something dark, clinging to his skin and staining it the same color. Dark, wet dirt. Ran up his sleeves, coated his pant legs, caked his old sneakers. I just stood there for a while thinking over the fact. Made me wonder what he was doing all that time he was gone. Every night. 

I went back to my room with the pot pie, and tried to let it be - just finish dinner and go to bed. Once I was sure he wasn't coming back, though, I couldn't help it. I went down the hall and up to his door. I stood there for a few seconds contemplating if I really had enough of a reason to go in - what I wanted to see, or what I didn't want to see if I did. If I had an answer, I've forgotten it since. I pushed it open.

I'd set up a twin bed in the room and some basic furnishings as a courtesy. The mattress was stuffed into the closet, now. The sheets and blankets were piled up into a corner, heavily stained. The smell of urine was distinct, which meant it was bad. The beige carpet was a camoflauge-esque patchwork of yellow and brown. More dirt, leaves, sticks, food wrappers were gathered in the other corners. Under the bedframe, there was more of it, and that was where I found the first little group of bones. Small, probably a cat at the biggest. Picked clean. I moved the bedframe over. More groups of bones. The duffel bag, probably blue at some point but now stained to a black-brown, was on top of the bedframe. There wasn't any food or any of his clothes in it. There were fox pelts. All rotten, some looking ancient, some far more fresh. Half a dozen or so. I'd been sleeping two doors down from this nightmare.

A couch pulled up against the front door, I stayed up all night waiting for him to come back. When I realized he was pushing at the front door, I pulled it open just enough to get a full look at him, and started shouting at the top of my lungs. I can't even remember what I said. I don't remember if I pulled the gun out or just had my hand on it. I was tired, and I was the angriest I'd been in my life. Whatever I was doing, it seemed to get the message across. He backed away, one cautious, smooth step at a time, keeping a steady pace all the while glaring at me with those glassy eyes. He went back as far as I could see him, then he was gone. I kept shouting even as he vanished. I'm certain I drew the attention of neighbors, but I didn't care. They'd probably gotten used to it by then. Finally, I ran back to his room, grabbed the duffel bag, and threw it outside, before barricading the door again, and collapsing to the ground in a heap. 

The police said it wasn't likely they'd be able to press any charges. No signed rental agreement, so I couldn't charge him for property damages. The bones didn't prove he'd killed the animals. Even if he had, the owners would have to file charges for that. I told them about the pelts, but they couldn't find the bag outside. At most, that could have been an illegal hunting charge, if provable. At a minimum, if he came back, I could file a restraining order. They left, I forced myself to sleep on the couch for two hours, called a locksmith at sunup, called in sick to work, and called George.

It wasn't all bad news, I thought. I'd gotten the time I needed to make amends with some people, including my old roomie, George. I invited him out for drinks I couldn't really afford. I told him about everything that I'd gotten myself into, how I knew it was all my fault for being such a pushover. I begged for him to come back when the room was livable again. Told him I was done fucking up time after time. Admitted that I needed him just to get things back to normal - to get myself back to normal. It all hit me at once, and then I was spilling tears out onto the bar top. I didn't want to pressure him into it, but I couldn't hold it back. I felt so tired. So alone.

I don't know, maybe I did feel something... more for George. Maybe I never wanted to consider it, but the sense of comfort I got from spending time around him, there were times that I really needed it to keep going. It was a comfort I never got from anyone else. One that I felt like I didn't deserve for everything I'd done up to then. He was the only person I'd been able to trust, and I threw that away. I needed it, I wanted it, but I didn't think I deserved it. I would never take it for myself.

Thankfully, he agreed, even offered to help with the cost for the cleaning. He told me the only way he'd move back was if it was ""deep-cleaned as deep as could be cleaned"", and didn't want me to ""skimp out"". He recommended a biohazard cleaning service that his buddy worked at. It was expensive, and it would take a full day, but it included a full replacement of the carpet. George's other stipulation was to spend a few nights helping him pack up his stuff and move some things into storage. Whatever it took, I'd do it. 

I ended up spending those few nights at his place. I was a little relieved to get a break from the disaster my own home had become. I was relieved to have his company. 

I went back home the night before George was supposed to move in, to meet up with one of the cleaners to do a quick walkthrough. The mattress, sheets, dresser, and nightstand had to be thrown out, but the metal bedframe was fully sanitized. Most importantly, the wallpaper and carpets were brand new and odor-free. Standing in that same doorway now, the sense of relief was incredible, but short-lived.

""By the way, man,"" the husky man interjected as he produced a carbon-copy invoice from a clipboard, ""you might want to call an exterminator or something.""

""What? Why?""

""Not sure what, but I definitely heard somethin' under the floor while we were working, maybe in your crawlspace? Couldn't find any evidence nearby, but with these pre-builts they're open-air and all, it's easy for them to get in. Y'know, I know someone - they do good work, if it's alright I'll give them your number and ask them to give you a call.""

""U-uh... sure. Sure, Sorry, thank you."" I couldn't be upset with him. It wasn't his fault, or his problem to fix, after all. But after he left, and I just sat in the empty living room, I couldn't bring myself to make a single move without thinking it over. Something under the floor. Something. Under me. Right now? I waited there, for any kind of sign. Nothing. I could tell myself it was some animal. That it was a fox or something - fox... the memory of the duffel bag made my guts curdle. But I couldn't rule out the possibility. 

Slowly and as quietly as I could manage, I got up off the couch, went over to the door, descended the front steps, and turned to look back at the house. Perfectly still, saturated in orange by the setting sun. Anything out of place. Any sign of intrusion. Any sign of him. I rounded the house to the back, and went to the large board under the kitchen window, covering the crawlspace access. In place, as it should be. Was there a way an animal could've gotten in anywhere else? I thought about going up and pulling the board away. 

Then I thought about those glints of bright green, meeting me there. I thought about being grabbed and pulled in to that cavernous, lightless space, and the board being slid back closed. I thought about them finding my body after that. Or not finding it. Or ending up in that duffel bag. I thought I could faintly smell urine and damp earth, or was it just my nerves telling me that? Was he already waiting right past the door? Only separated by a cheap plywood board and vinyl siding? Did he already know I was standing there? Did he know that I knew? 

I slid the new key into the deadbolt and sealed up the house again. Staring at it from the driver's seat, I had to force my eyes back on the road as I drove away. 

I should've just called George and waited. I should've called the police, even if I didn't have any evidence or objective justification. But I'm not unfamiliar with mistakes, after all. No, I drove back to George's apartment, and told him in person. I expected him to tell me it was an overreaction and just go back home, or offer to come over and help clear the crawlspace. Instead, he just gave me a long hug. I don't know if he ever knew how I felt about him, but it hurts me to say that he probably knew me a lot better than I thought. It was the closest we'd been, that night - the closest we'd ever be. He told me to stay the night and we could check it out in the morning.

I'd only learned how heated things had gotten between my Ex and George well after the breakup. George came home that day to find one of my Ex's friends asleep in his bed, and needless to say he wasn't having it, banging his fist on the frame and yelling at him to get out. And this big, lumpy-faced biker dude tries to give him a death glare while half-asleep and half-buzzed. It missed the mark, George told him to leave or he'd kick his ass, and he lumbered back down the hall, still trying to stare him down without tripping over his own feet. Then he found out his clothes had been picked through, a couple of his nicer shirts gone and a sweatshirt that smelled like rotten vinegar left behind. He started to check the rest of the room. Chargers, the cash in his nightstand, his flash drives, his buckskin jacket, he just kept finding more and more shit missing. He stormed out into the living room and confronted the guy, and of course he denied it. George tried to challenge it, but then my Ex got up and tried to talk him back. Said that since he was dating me, he ""owned this place more than you do, so you better not talk to my friends like that, or I'll have your sorry ass out in the gutter."" Then he added that he ""liked fucking in that room anyways, so you better get used to sharing.""

George went back to the room, loaded up a backpack, and went over to a friend's place to ask if he could bunk there for a while. She said yeah, so he came back about an hour later to pick up the rest of his things, only to find his room gutted. Ex made some snarky remark and George turned right around and decked him. Big biker guy came up and socked him in the eye, knocked him to the ground, and they both just started waling on him. Didn't stop him from trying to fight back - he grabbed the big guy's leg and yanked, pulling him off balance and toppling over on top of my Ex. Got to his feet and knocked his bald, meaty head with a steel toe. He got down right into my Ex's face and demanded him to ""tell me what you did with all my shit!"" Ex elbowed him in the throat. Big guy tried to pull a knife on him, but wasn't slick at all with it, managing to cut his own hand up worse than George. But still, the hits kept coming, and he realized there wasn't any chance he'd win this - one against two, his odds were never good. And what was he fighting for? There wasn't a chance my Ex was going to get him his stuff back - it was all probably long gone by that point. Never got any of it back, from what I remember. For all that he knew, I'd picked my Ex over our friendship. So he just turned around and left. 

George held a grudge against him, which had been rekindled when I reconnected with him. A few too many beers that night loosened up a rant about how he just *knew* it was my Ex's fault this all happened. Too perfect to just be a coincidence. Said he wouldn't be surprised if my Ex had sought out the craziest fucker he could find and handed my flyer to him, maybe gave him the money for it. Just so he could claim another victory over someone who'd wronged him. As he sunk deeper into it, George started to work himself up something awful. He claimed that my Ex might've hoped the guy would try to cut my throat, or set the house on fire, or steal everything I had, or rape me. I tried to calm him down, tell him it wasn't something we needed to think about now, that if it escalated the police would handle it, and he snapped back. 

""For fucks sake, James, you have no right not to be mad! If I met him face-to-face today I'd put a hole in his chest and put him the ground! People like him can't get away with this, and you can't let /him/ do it to you!"" 

It took me and one of George's other roommates to calm him down, and even then it took a while, but he didn't bring it up again the rest of the evening. Maybe we should have just let him work it out then, after all, trying to talk with him about it, wait with him until he'd sobered up again. But instead I just stopped worrying about it, afterwards. I fell asleep relaxed, thinking about how things were going to be better in the morning.

I woke up on the communal couch. When it was still dark out, and the apartment was silent, I felt something was wrong. I went up to his room, and pushed open the door. My stomach sank like lead. His shotgun case was on the bed, open. The gun was gone. And he wasn't there.

His parking spot was empty as I ran towards my car. I drove too fast and slid into the mound of mushy, churned snow that had been piled up on the shoulder of 12th, and wasted almost 10 minutes digging myself out and getting back onto the road. I practically fell out of my car when I got back home.

The house was dark. His car was parked across the front lawn. No signs of activity. I pulled out the revolver, cocked it, and swung open the wheel. 4 rounds of .38. They'd been in there for a while, but it was better than being empty. I swung it shut, and made my way to the back of the house, moving cautiously.

The cover was sitting off to one side of the deep black rectangle beneath the kitchen window. There were no sounds, no signs of movement. I put the gun up, and got the courage to speak. 

""George?"" It came out far too quiet, but I wasn't ready to get any louder. Nothing. 

I crouched closer to the hole, stopped, and listened. Nothing. ""George?"" A little louder, but no more of a response.

On my knees, I paused at the very edge of the opening. Nothing. 

I pulled out my phone, put on the flashlight, and crept in an inch, sweeping around the edges of the opening and trying to keep the pistol aimed. The light was pathetic, showing the first couple of feet ahead within the chasmic darkness as I inched further and further in. When I climbed past a drainage pipe, something glinted in the edge of the light, and I stopped. I suddenly felt stranded. I had held on to some amount of hope that everything would be better by the morning. That this would all be over, and things would be better. 

The shotgun laid in the dirt, abandoned. My mind spun as I tried to think about what I could do by that point. My knuckles went white, gripping the pistol tighter. 

My eyes drifted across the area. I picked out another anomaly in the light, an unusual, large mound in the dirt. I got a little closer, trying to see around it. Right before the mound I found the hole. 'Fox den' comes to mind whenever I think back to it, but it's a poor descriptor. It was too big for that - had to have been 2 feet or more in diameter. Damp earth packed into a rough circle, the imprints of palms and fingers a grotesque frame around the black aperture. The smell of urine was undeniable. I brought up my phone, and stuck it down into the hole. 

The bottoms of George's shoes faced back up at me. 

""G-George??"" The words burst out, threatening to tear my chest open.

The shoes shot deeper into the hole with a solid scrape, out of view.

Something like a fox's bark echoed from down inside, far too close.

In the dash out of the crawlspace, I dropped my phone. It was at least 10 seconds in that complete darkness, stumbling blind, trying to listen for a sign of movement while scrambling through the dirt. I dove through the entry, ran to the nearest neighbor, and tried to convince her to call the police for me. She wasn't having it, though. It wasn't until I got to the third house that I was able to put a call in. I don't ask why, all I know is that it took too long.

The police found George's body in that hole, throat cut. It went down quite a ways. They only found a duffel bag, George's wallet, and trash at the very bottom. No one else was there, he'd already gotten away again. The plentiful DNA evidence told the police everything they would find out anyways.

George became the latest victim of John Saint-John - unrelated - who had become known as 'The Fox Hole Killer'. Saint-John had run away from his family as a child, remained missing for 20 years, and reemerged as a kind of specter. One that drifted across the United States, leaving a trail of 'burrows' and bodies. He blended into the drifting waves of homelessness, 'just another bum' to passers by. When he found someplace he could settle down - get food and clothes and suitable cover - he would build a burrow and live there. The theory was that his victims were the ones to find his 'den', and once the den was discovered he would flee it, and move on.

Once he'd struck and fled, no one could seem to pick him out of the crowd. Never in the same place twice. By the time the local police would learn about him, he was already gone. Federal agents had no luck on keeping track of him, striking months or years apart on different sides of the country, no perceivable pattern in his movements. They all knew who it was, and it didn't help them a damned bit.

About the fox pelts, and the unusual uptick in fox activity that people started to report wherever he had lived, no one pretended to understand.

The DNA evidence cleared my name, and I gave the police a statement on how I'd come to know Saint-John and the events had lead up to that night, giving George's old roommate's name to back my story up. I did my part, giving the best description I could. Saint-John's face was swathed underneath matted hair, and the only detail I could give any accurate description of were his eyes, an approximate height, and his build. 

I never went back to that house. I quit my job, packed up what I had, and moved in with my uncle several states over. Even though I hadn't spoken to him since mom died, he offered to let me stay there while I worked on getting the house sold, eventually taking a loss just to get it over with. I was able to find a job nearby, and rented out the basement level of his house. 

And almost every night, I find myself dwelling on it, asking myself if *all* of it had really been my fault. Not one of my actions had prevented what happened. I gave in to my Ex, and drove everyone away. I let Saint-John into my house. And that night, it could have been me that looked down into that hole, looked Saint-John in his emerald eyes one last time. But by acting on my own cowardice, it was George instead. I moved away, trying to blame the house for all of it, trying to wash my hands clean by giving it all up, but the guilt stuck like cigarette tar.

I'll never fully get over it, and the nights seem to drag on longer and longer. Even if I could, it's not like I could fall asleep anyways.

1odro8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/letsdrawconclusions/comments/1odro8l/not_sure_what_and_how_to_write/,Not sure what and how to write?,"Have you tried every possible approach to writing and still don’t know what to write or how to write about it?
Nothing seems to click with you?

Like with every new skill, the modern civilized human has become so impatient. They want the magical solution right away, without trying. And they search and search and search for other people’s solutions on YouTube.


Don’t despair over not finding what you’re looking for (fast enough). Bouncing around between approaches, ideas, and routines is a normal part of building self-awareness.
You need all of those experiences with yourself to observe how you, your mind, and your body react to them in real life.

Take meditation, for example. Before I settled on my current routine, I bounced around between a thousand different approaches.

Guided meditations, silent meditations, eyes open, eyes closed, lying down, seated, with music, walking, relaxing or activating.

It’s normal that we don’t want to go through that process because it’s time-consuming, frustrating, and lengthy.
Everything our modern inattentive brain doesn’t want.


In her book The Right to Write, Julia Cameron mentions the importance of being comfortable with yourself and your approach.
Some write formally, some take it easy.

Some write fast, some write slow.
Some long, some short.
Do I like writing while I walk?
Do I like writing while I drink coffee, water, beer?
In an armchair? No, my neck hurts.
On my phone? Tablet? Computer? Pen and paper?


Experience all of them for yourself.

Should I use Dan Koe’s, Nick Kole’s, or Justin Welsh’s writing framework?
Collecting and analyzing them won’t get you closer to an answer.
You need all of the trial and error to get to know yourself.
For some, it takes one month to find their groove, others need to experiment for six years.
The important part is to closely observe yourself. Reflect and learn about what works for YOU.

Have fun in the process and don’t let anyone tell you they have THE solution for you. They probably don’t. But they might have SOME solution that brings you closer to self-awareness and self-understanding.

If you can’t keep up with 3000-word posts, make them 200-word posts. If that doesn’t work, write one sentence. If that feels worthless, write ten.

If, after months of trial and error, it turns out that writing may not be your thing, try drawings, illustrations, videos, or comics.

No one will ever be able to tell you what activity, approach, or routine is for you. They can’t experience and feel for you.
The feeling when you actually perform the action will be your signpost.

So dive right into it and listen closely to how you feel, but don’t give up too early and don’t shy away from going back and forth to try and retry.

Happy practicing!

I’ve been noticing that I’ve gotten tired earlier tho like by 7pm and I’m not sure if it’s cause of coffee crash, not eating enough protein even tho I think I eat enough, or the workouts being too much.

1odrmo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OxygenBar/comments/1odrmo6/what_exactly_is_an_oxygen_bar_and_why_its_gaining/,What Exactly Is an Oxygen Bar — and Why It’s Gaining Serious Attention,"If you’ve ever walked by a booth at an event where people are lounging with sleek cannulas under their noses, surrounded by softly glowing lights and the scent of eucalyptus or citrus — you’ve probably spotted an **oxygen bar**.

# 💨 What Is an Oxygen Bar?

An oxygen bar delivers concentrated oxygen — typically around **90–95% purity** — that’s mixed with **aromatherapy scents** like peppermint, lavender, or citrus. Guests inhale this purified oxygen for 5–15 minutes through a disposable nasal cannula while relaxing in a comfortable setting.

The experience is often described as **refreshing, energizing, and calming**, depending on the aroma blend used.

# ⚗️ Why Are They Becoming So Popular?

1. **Stress Relief in a Fast-Paced World** Between work, traffic, and constant screen time, people are seeking short, restorative breaks. A few minutes of pure oxygen with calming scents can help users feel mentally clearer and more relaxed.
2. **Natural Energy Boost (No Caffeine Crash)** Instead of reaching for another cup of coffee, some people are turning to oxygen bars for a natural pick-me-up. Higher oxygen intake can promote alertness and focus without the jittery side effects.
3. **Wellness & Event Trend** Oxygen bars have become popular at **corporate wellness events, weddings, trade shows, and festivals**. They offer a “wow” factor — an interactive wellness experience that guests actually talk about.
4. **Aromatherapy Synergy** Combining essential oils with oxygen enhances the experience. For instance:
   * **Peppermint** = energizing
   * **Lavender** = calming
   * **Citrus** = mood-boosting
   * **Eucalyptus** = refreshing and clearing
5. **Corporate & Workplace Wellness** Many companies are exploring oxygen therapy stations as part of **employee wellness programs**, helping combat fatigue and promote mindfulness during long workdays.

# 🚀 Why Now?

With rising awareness around **mental health, burnout, and biohacking**, oxygen bars fit neatly into the modern wellness landscape. They’re portable, safe, and easy to set up — making them a natural fit for health-minded communities and forward-thinking workplaces.

# 🌱 Bottom Line

An oxygen bar isn’t about medical treatment — it’s about **wellbeing, recovery, and mindfulness** in a world that rarely slows down. Whether it’s a few minutes at a wellness fair or a regular perk at work, people are discovering that a little more oxygen might be exactly what they’ve been missing.",1,1761186278.0,OxygenBar,0,1.0,False

1odrkru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odrkru,😣😖😣,"Avg dodo experience at this uni goes like: 
You get coffee from time after waiting 30 mins + in the long a$$ line. Then you feel like doing dodo, ok so you go to the dodo spot, but what you see? Literally all stalls are taken. Ok so now 2 options, either go to another dodo spot or wait for it to get empty. Then when you get your turn, not sure why some of the spots even have a door? cause gap below and on sides is like a hallway ( exaggerating but you get the point ). Ok so now you look at the toilet, and 2/10 times or 3/10 when campus is busy you see piss all over seat or dodo not flushed, but this is like a different vent cause its not really unis fault, its the dumb asses who get in uni but morons don’t know how to use a damn toilet. 

Ok so now you close the door, but why the fuck is the area so small, especially in IB and Davis, that when closing the door, the damn toilet has to touch your pants. Motherfuckers give us enough room to close door without hitting the damn toilet. sometimes, in MN or DH, the water be like piss yellow. Wtf if this plumbing man? Like you got the drain to go in toilet fill tank or what? Yuck bro. 
Now, I always always clean the damn toilet before sitting and put bunch on toilet paper on seat cause of hygiene issue, don’t care if it is sparkling clean or i need to do dodo urgently, cause you never know what kinda unhygienic shit be on that seat, and I gotta pray later so gotta keep the thighs clean. 
Motherfuckin sensors now decide to flush as Im sitting on the seat, like fuck are they so sensitive, that they gotta flush everytime i sit, stand or move on the seat, sometimes the water from flush touches your bottom and yuck bro the whole vibes gets shit. 
Different vent but wish they made the elevators this fast rather then dodo toilet sensors, motherfuckers all over uni including Cct, Library, Davis, IB, Dh amd MN go at the speed of a snail, takes like days to go up and down on those elevators. Now you gotta wash hand, but the god damn sink faucet has no water, ok, you go to next sink, the damn water is either is so low on pressure that your unable to wash hands properly or its boiling hot to give you a burn. 


WHAT THE FUCK BRO? LIKE WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS? 

At this point charge me 100$ more on the bunch of bullshit you are charging me (for things I never used) and give more god damn toilets bro. Its not a luxury, its a god damn necessity. 

Student union should go to hell imo tbh, like you are gonna fight some bills that restrict funding but not gonna ask uni to do anything about this toilet situation to get more god damn toilets? 

Like seriously, library each damn floor as 1 toilet per floor for men (except ground has 2 but it’s always packed) . 

Imagine getting education at one of the top uni but going through shit Dodo experience. 
No wonder frend pepefart696969 stopped posting, bro got traumatized from the pepe dodo experience.

I'm mainly interested in a sofa style seat, with a movable ottoman as it's for me and my elderly pup, so a lower height set will work well.  I don't anticipate we will spend a ton of time out there but I do intend on getting some good reading and morning coffee time in on it for sure.

His mom (“Lydia”) is obsessed with his ex “Tess.” They dated in college a decade ago. Lydia still calls her “like the daughter I never had.” 🙃

We were out of town last weekend for my grandma’s 80th. I left the thermostat on eco, dishes done, guest room made up for *no one*. Sunday night I open the front door and get hit with strong perfume and see my pink robe draped over the couch. Our dog’s water bowl is moved, there’s a half-empty La Croix on the coffee table, and a glass baking dish of lasagna in the fridge labeled “For Ev.”

My stomach dropped. I checked our pet cam and watched a woman (Tess) let herself in Friday afternoon with a key, hug my dog, put her overnight bag down, and sleep in our guest room. She left Saturday morning, came back that night with the lasagna, took a selfie with the dog on our couch (!!!), and left a sticky note: “So good to be back in this kitchen. Missed this little guy. –T.”

I immediately called Evan. He said, “Oh. Mom said Tess might drop off a casserole because she was making one for Mom after her dental surgery. She probably didn’t realize she shouldn’t hang out.” I asked how Tess had a key. He admitted Lydia “borrowed” our spare *a while ago* for “emergencies” and… never returned it. Lydia gave it to Tess because “her hands were full and I trust her.”

I changed every lock and disabled Lydia’s door code that night. I told Evan he could sleep at Lydia’s until the three of them returned my property (key and garage clicker), replaced my robe and makeup Tess used (yep—the bathroom counter was a crime scene), and agreed to new boundaries in writing: no keys out of our possession, no unannounced guests, and no one enters our home when we aren’t there. Also, a real apology from both of them.

Now Lydia is running a group chat campaign about how I “humiliated” her by locking out “family” and how I should be grateful someone “kept the dog company.” Evan says I’m “making a big deal out of kindness.” He’s mad I told him to stay with his mom until this is resolved, but I honestly don’t feel safe knowing a third party felt comfortable *sleeping* in my house and wearing my clothes because his mom decided my boundaries didn’t matter.

Am I overreacting for changing the locks and drawing a hard line? Or is this as bonkers as it feels?

TL;DR: MIL gave our house key to my husband’s ex without telling me. Ex let herself in while we were out of town, slept over, used my stuff, and left a “Missed this” note. I changed the locks, removed MIL’s access, and told my husband to stay at MIL’s until boundaries and apologies happen. AIO?

edit !! forgot to include this. Our neighbor has a spare key and comes by to feed and walk our dog if im ever out of town, we never leave our dog alone especially for that long. ",203,1761185584.0,AmIOverreacting,121,0.95,False

1odrbap,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1odrbap/fn_rf_the_vote_for_doomsday/,[FN] [RF] The Vote for Doomsday,"My mother is wearing an “I voted” sticker proudly on her chest. Typically they would be red and white or something else patriotic or basic and otherwise not revealing what choice the voter made. This one is decorated with little orange-red explosions on the sides, symbolizing her pride for choosing “YES” on perhaps the last ballot she’ll ever cast in this world.

She tells me it’s because this world has fallen too far into sin and must be redeemed, but I think it’s because her life is hard and she wants an easy way out. Either way, I’m not old enough to vote and my words mean nothing. You have to be thirty to cast a ballot. Thirty. Everyone younger than that is told to eat shit and die if the geriatric corpses decide it’s time to end it all.

I’ve argued with her enough. Today I will say nothing. There are no more words left to be said. None of them care what I think. She’s made her opinion on my life clear: it should be ended.

My father comes downstairs to retrieve a cup of coffee. On his chest is also blazened the orange-red sticker of “DEATH.” I don’t think he knows what the ballot said.

They turn on the TV and it begins speaking about the only issue anyone cares about anymore. The newscaster screams about how the world is corrupt and this is the promised time of redemption, the chosen hour in which the righteous will make the wicked finally burn in hellfire. All the sin is too much, he says, we must therefore allow the world to come to its natural end after a thousand lifetimes of sin that have stretched God’s infinite grace beyond its limits.

I leave the room and take out my phone. Every single notification is about the vote for doomsday: my friends are texting me about it, YouTube is spamming me with it, TikTok is spamming me with it, Instagram is spamming me with it. “What’s your opinion about the question?” “What do you think should be done?” “What I think should be done, part 12 of 16.” “WHY EVERYONE DESERVES TO DIE.”

The comments are always eviscerating the videos, but the engagement is so high the algorithms keep pushing them anyway. Young people aren’t allowed to vote, so of course the only thing we can do is watch. The only thing we can do is watch the world die at the hands of those who choose actively to kill us in a decision made for us about our lives.

Something tells me they think we don’t deserve to live. Something tells me they think that because their lives are full of regrets that ours aren’t worth living. Something tells me they think life isn’t worth living but don’t want to admit it or act on the feeling.

I’m glued to my screen until the evening. The vote comes back 47 to 53 against. My phone is buzzing continuously for an hour but I throw it away, my heart racing. Something tells me they expect it all to go back to normal in the morning. That when I go downstairs for breakfast my parents will greet me “hello sunshine” just like any other day as if they didn’t vote to kill me the day before.

I will be made to smile and pretend that what they have done is right and normal and merely an expression of their opinion on the question of the bomb as though it were some abstract question about the future lives of people yet to be born and not mine today right here right now. And if I question them I am sure they will tell me to shut up and sit down, the adults made a decision and it’s time to respect their opinion. So what if the vote was 47% in favor of my death? It was just a poll, you have to respect people’s opinions on these things.

And when they text me one day asking why I’ve cut them off they’ll surely be bewildered when I tell them as though their opinion on my life wasn’t clear already. They’re cowards who’d never say what they mean to my face, always distancing themselves through a ballot as though it didn’t mean the same thing.

My father knocks gently on the door.

“What?!”

He knocks again, still softly.

“Jesus, Dad, what is it?!’ The exasperation is clear in my voice.

He knocks again, tapping hard now but still quiet.

I get up and open the door.

TL;DR at the bottom.

My fiancé (23M) and I (22F) have been engaged for just over a month and we're long distance because I'm in my last semester of college. Shortly after we got engaged, my health declined pretty quickly. I have severe fatigue as well as back pain and numbness on one side of my body that has been flaring up about once a week. It's lowkey terrifying to watch my body fall apart. Prior to our engagement, I was going to the gym about 4-5 days a week and almost every day was a good day in my eyes. He's only really seen me at my best up until now. Now, with the constant fatigue and frequent pain, my days are pretty rough most of the time. In spite of this, I always make an effort to tell my fiancé about the good things that are going on in my day and what I'm grateful for. I also see a therapist and journal and vent to my friends and family so that I don't burden him too much.

When I'm feeling really bad, I take a step back from our conversations so I don't spend the whole time complaining about how much pain I'm in or how tired I am. The only time I bring these things up is when he asks how I'm doing or how my day is going, and even then, occasionally I sugarcoat things and leave it at ""I'm okay, just got out of class"". Maybe 30% of the time, I say something like, ""I'm alright, I didn't sleep great last night because of the pain but I took some Tylenol"" or something like that. I visit the doctor often, I'm calling a neurologist tomorrow about the numbness, and I do everything possible to manage my pain and fatigue such as drinking lots of coffee or taking a muscle relaxer. To sum it up, if I actually do complain, I always explain what I'm gonna do to address the problem and I bring up the positives in my day as much as possible. I also keep it extremely brief, maybe one or two messages about what's going on and that's it. I make an effort to change the topic afterwards when I have the strength and I usually succeed, but sometimes I admit I rely on him to do it because the pain/fatigue is all I can think about. It's like trying to make small talk about the weather while actively puking. But when the fatigue and/or the pain clears, I tell him that, and I'm able to see and talk about the goodness in the world again.

A couple days ago, I was surprised to hear him say he didn't think things were going well between us. The only reason I even found this out was because I asked. He said he wasn't sure if he could handle our cultural differences because he tries to stay grateful for what he has and he doesn't complain or talk about his problems because that would mean he's ungrateful to God. I asked what he meant by problems and he said he was referring to my health problems. I'm at a loss for what else I can do differently. He said he wishes I would talk about something else sometimes, but the thing is, I do. It's just hard to think of things to say when I'm so tired that it hurts or if my back is acting up. So I already avoid texting him when all I can think about are my illnesses. He said he already has so many problems going on in his life and that our relationship is supposed to be an escape. I told him I've already held back a lot of info from him, such as the fact that I almost went to the hospital last week because of my back pain. He said nothing in response.

I learned later on in our conversation last night that he experiences a lot of empathy when people share their problems with him and he tends to internalize them. He was also raised with a toxic positivity mindset and complaining isn't natural to him. I shared an anecdote about how I comforted a friend having a panic attack by echoing how they felt and validating them and he said he'd try to implement those strategies. We came to a compromise where he'd change the topic if he gets the sense we're spending too much time on it. This morning, I waited to text him until after my coffee kicked in so that I could honestly say I was doing well when he asked. But I still felt like an AH for answering him honestly later in the day when he asked how my health was. His response (""I'm sorry, that must be so painful"") felt really forced and like he was just going through the motions. He's doing exactly what I suggested he do, which was to actively listen and radically accept the situation for what it is instead of saying something like ""it could be worse"" but I can tell this isn't coming naturally to him and I'm worried that this is going to burn him out. I can't tell if I'm asking for too much. To sum things up, AITA?

TL;DR: I'm doing everything I can to take care of my fatigue and back pain. My fiancé took me by surprise by saying he wished I would talk about something other than my health problems when I already make an effort to do so and only bring them up on occasion when asked. I feel ungrateful because he took my advice about actively listening and is trying to validate my feelings but I can tell he's forcing it (which I'm worried is going to cause compassion fatigue) and I still feel guilty for voicing when I don't feel well.",1,1761185038.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1odr5y3,https://i.redd.it/ttenkatm6qwf1.png,"Another day, another Condemned idea! Terrance, The Ladder's Top","A greedy and selfish man who saw business as an art and employees a means to an end. His offices have been dubbed ""The Killing Floor"" by those he fired and left without hope. He was Arthur and Declan's employer before the incident and hated them specifically for what he perceives as ""a threat to my position"". He worked them day in day out and did whatever he could to hinder any progress. He was the last to die in the mass murder of Liona Finances, with Arthur barging in with a pistol in hand, and shot Terrance right in the eye. Now damned for his selfish greed and treachery, he now begrudgingly helps other survivors. Not out of compassion, but out of there being more targets the judges to focus on instead if he keeps them alive

Terrance is a mixture of survivalist and support, buffing allies with new gadgets and hindring the Killer's movements

His Passive is: Overtime!  
""I have no time for dying.""  
Upon being hit with fatal damage. Terrance has 10 seconds of normal movement and can use abilites before dying after the 10 seconds are over. He cannot heal himself while in the Overtime state

  
His First Ability Is: Supply Drop  
""Make it quick!""

Terrance takes out his flip-phone and talks to a mysterious person on the other end of the line. 10 seconds later, a supply crate will drop somewhere on the map that is highlighted to only him. Inside the crate are various tools that he and other survivors can use. The items are as followed

Taser: With this item equipped, press m1 to aim the taser and press again to fire it, hitting the killer with it stuns them for 4 seconds and destroys the taser

Stopwatch: When a survivor uses the item, they gain a massive speedboost for 5 seconds, but have their location revealed to the killer for the duration

Coffee: Drinking a cup of coffee restores 40 hp

Security Panel: Using said device reveals the killer's location for 20 seconds before being destroyed

Blueprint: completes a large portion of a task for free on use

The Judge can find these supply crates themselves an destroy them before they can be used

His 2nd ability is: Effective Motivator  
""GET TO WORK!""  
Terrance lets out a pulse around him, which gives nearby survivors a 40% task completion boost for 10 seconds, and for every survivor affected by the boost, gives him a 10% speed boost for 10 seconds (minimum of 10%)

His 3rd ability is: Briefcase Coverup  
""Show 'em the files.""  
Terrance opens his briefcase and throws a pile of papers out of it in a frontfacing hitbox, if it lands, the killer is blinded and slowed down by the papers. If holding at item while using this ability you sacrifice that item and place it in the briefcase, and for every item that you place in the briefcase (up to 4), the effects of the attack increases in duration, and the hitbox becomes bigger

His 4th ability is: Off The Clock  
""You're late...""

Terrance checks his watch as ticking noises are heard, this adds 15 seconds to the timer and gives every survivor around him including himself a 25% speedboost for 10 seconds. This move is disabled in Last Man Standing

I had an idea of Terrance and Arthur have a special last man standing if the Judge is Declan, I have some name ideas like ""Corporate Hell"", ""After Hours"", and ""By The Bootstraps""

For Skins, I got a couple

Builderman Skin: Pretty self explanatory, and is specifically Builderman's modern version

Ashle Skin: ""Uh Oh Spaghettio!""

Residence: Dragon Goul City, Apex World — lives and performs at a grand circus

🧠 Personality

Mr. Mondro is a flamboyant, unpredictable, and highly intelligent performer. He laughs constantly, his eyes always smiling with him.He’s dramatic, unique, and completely devoted to entertainment. Mondro finds joy in chaos, yet every act hides a purpose.He’s a jokester, showman, and genius strategist — wise in battle but insane in method.Mondro always keeps his promises when making deals, and although his love for performance drives him too far, he believes every fight, laugh, and scream adds to his show’s perfection.

🍽️ Favorite Foods & Drink

⚡ Powers & Abilities

Snap Teleportation:Instantly teleports anywhere with a finger snap, creating illusionary clones of himself to confuse opponents. Moves faster than sight and can strike between snaps.

Confuse Snap Attack:Snaps near an opponent’s face to stun or disorient them for 10 seconds — then delivers a powerful strike capable of distorting their body’s energy flow.

Mind Control Snap:A single snap lets him control minds for up to 10 hours. Victims obey his every command — even to fight themselves or allies — until the effect ends.

Limbs Reach:Can stretch his limbs up to 80,000,000,000 feet in length, allowing him to grab, strike, and throw opponents with immense force. His elastic reach makes him nearly impossible to escape.

Human Shapeshift:Transforms into either a human male or female form for disguise or infiltration. Often uses this to confuse enemies or blend into crowds.

Power Erase:Snaps his fingers to erase an opponent’s special move or ability. The only way to regain it is by defeating Mr. Mondro himself.

Palm Absorb:Uses his palm to absorb incoming attacks or elemental powers, strengthening his next strike and amplifying his overall energy.

Reality Motion:Transforms the battlefield into a cosmic realm of warped space where his speed and defense reach peak levels. Even time-based or reversal abilities cannot affect him in this state.

Ancient Dragon Awakening (Special Move):Transforms into a 39-foot-tall cosmic dragon. Gains extreme regeneration, reflective skin that bounces attacks back, and a devastating Flaming Dragon Fire Blast capable of melting through barriers.

Ancient Demon Form (Special Move):Becomes an 82-foot-tall demon who reads enemy movements effortlessly. Any strike against him paralyzes the attacker. His Dark Blast can knock opponents unconscious while increasing his speed beyond teleportation limits.

💞 Relationships

Reno (Great Friendship):Sees Reno as a gifted student in his circus, sharing powerful fire techniques with him and treating him as an upcoming performer.

Shinobie (Trust / Friendship):One of the few he truly trusts. Admires Shinobie’s shadow powers and leadership potential, even believing Shinobie could one day lead his own team.

Chiena (Great Friendship):Respects Chiena’s balance and independence. Often trains her in advanced speed tricks, admiring her natural control.

Cannady (Partner / Love Interest):Finds her obsessive nature strange but endearing. He’s patient and kind toward her despite her intensity, secretly believing she might be “the one.”

Marcaline (Interest / Rejection):Once desired to date her, but after rejection, he remained intrigued. He admires her strength and often speaks with her about her past and powers.

Dara (Good Friendship):Friendly and respectful toward Dara, believing she’d be a perfect star for his circus. After she refused to join, he decided to challenge her in battle instead — yet still sees her as a kind soul.

J (Enemy / Respect):Considers J his rival yet respects him deeply. Once saved J during a battle — an act that changed their dynamic forever. He hopes one day J will perform in his “show,” even if through battle.

Stripes (Neutral / Dislike):Detests Stripes’ anger and aggression. Believes Stripes’ pride and temper would ruin his circus’s harmony.

Aishen (Hatred / Tense Friendship):Despises Aishen for interfering with his plans for Dara but still treats him politely. Their rivalry remains professional yet bitter.

🎭 Backstory

Mr. Mondro, known as The Clown Host of the Apex, is a legendary entertainer who rules the Dragon Goul Circus — a place of endless lights, drama, and danger.He never intended to become a villain; he only wanted to bring joy and awe to the Apex World. But his obsession with perfection and fame led him down a darker path — using mind control to force others into his performances.
Despite his twisted methods, Mondro shows glimpses of compassion and remorse. He occasionally frees those he’s controlled, claiming he “wanted them to feel the spotlight.” Deep down, he believes he’s not evil — just misunderstood, chasing the dream of becoming the greatest circus host in the Apex World.
His close companions — Reno, Shinobie, Chiena, and Cannady — help him balance his insanity and genius. Mondro walks the line between performer and manipulator, between laughter and tragedy. He’s a villain to some… but to himself, he’s simply the star of the greatest show ever performed.

So, I (M21) am hitting that stage where I’d genuinely like to meet some new people, maybe even a potential partner, but the process of initiating conversation feels like climbing a mountain made of awkward silence.
I'm a classic introvert. I recharge alone, I overthink things, and my brain often has an entire screenplay ready to go, but the words get stuck in the launching bay. I'm not afraid of people, just the initial energy expenditure and the fear of that first interaction falling flat.
For my fellow introverts here:
What's your go-to, low-pressure opener when you're trying to talk to someone new (and maybe want to see if there's a connection)? I'm looking for things that aren't super aggressive but are more interesting than just ""Nice weather, huh?""
How do you manage that internal anxiety spike right before you walk up, or right before you send that first DM?
Where do you even meet people where the expectation isn't 100% high-energy small talk? (e.g., Book clubs, specific volunteer work, quiet coffee shops?)
I’d love to hear the battle-tested strategies that let you transition from observing the room to actually being in the room, without completely draining your social battery for the rest of the week.

1odqv8l,https://i.redd.it/cru7p5h5orwf1.jpeg,I saw something odd last year and I wanted to run it by people.,"I’m using a throw-away account as I just would rather remain anonymous. I’m posting because last January, I saw something… odd. 

For some background on myself, I am a 28 (then 27) year old woman, I went to a non denominational Christian (though I’d argue Calvinist) school from age 4-12 and then I attended a Catholic university. My grandparents were all catholic though they never attended church. My parents are both catholic too… apparently even my siblings… but they don’t attend church either. None of us has ever been baptized or anything else.  Best way to describe my family would be “non-practicing Catholics for several generations”. Except for myself. I lean another way. 

As a whole, as a person, I’m quite agnostic. I think there’s a higher power and I believe most religions are all just different iterations of the same thing. I believe that we and they are trying to connect with and make sense of the same thing. Considering how long humans have existed and how many religions have been born and died in as much time? To me that just makes sense. (Yes I’m a history grad). I know lots about history, the Bible, etc. after all I spent much of my youth in Christian (Catholic) school. 

My uneasiness or lack of surety doesn’t change or cheapen what I saw. But it doesn’t leave me able to comprehend or understand it either. All my logic and studies don’t have answers for this. 

➡️➡️➡️ On January 28, 2024 I was riding back from my late grandparents house; my mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat. It was sometime before midnight. But I looked out the window and I saw something on the church steeple we were driving by. This will sound insane, but I saw a hooded/veiled, winged, glowing figure… bright white and blue, near the top of their church steeple. It was there for 3 to 4 seconds and I was confused by what I saw so I turned quickly to get a better look, but it was gone. I said nothing to my mother at the moment as I didn’t want her to think me crazy. But the feeling of peace and comfort that I had when seeing it, was unlike anything I’ve ever felt before. 

The next morning, I was riding with my mother and brother in the car. We were going past a Marian shrine in my state on the way to my brother's then girlfriend's house. My brother asked about the shrine at Champion and I explained the history behind it. We had a great great grandmother who was there when it was an orphanage even. 

And I wasn’t going to say anything initially, but I got gutsy and I explained to my mother and brother what I saw on that church steeple the night before. I just had to share as it was so profound and I was so confused. Not confused, but conflicted. Feeling like exploding. 

My mother responded, “I thought you were acting odd staring out the window.” 

And I said, “I don’t even know which church it is, it’s the one past the coffee shop.” 

And my mother said, “Well wait, isn’t that church St Mary’s? So you saw an Angel or figure on St. Mary’s...” 

And I said that sounded crazy, for the church to be St. Mary’s, so I googled it on my phone. I was a bit shocked by the answer. I said, “holy cow.” And my mother said, “what?” 

I explained, “I saw an Angel on the steeple of St. Mary of the Angels Church. The church is literally named St. Mary of the Angels.” 

My mother and brother agreed that it was eerie at the very least. It felt quite profound seeing it in the first place, but upon learning the name of the church, that was quite stunning. We all sat in the car silent for a while upon learning the name of the place. 

🚨 I’ll have you know, since then, I’ve tried EVERYTHING to debunk it. I’ve tried riding past at all hours trying to replicate what I saw because maybe it was an odd flash or maybe it was a glare on the window. I even tried RUNNING past and running past while taking photos, but nothing whatsoever could replicate what I saw. I messed with the flash on cameras and I searched for cameras and light sources nearby or even projectors and nada. Absolutely nothing I did replicated it. I tried in the rain and snow even, but nothing. 

🚨 So next I thought “maybe it’s medical” and I went to my doctor to discuss psych stuff, because hey… maybe I’m going crazy. I don’t know. But my doctor and psychiatrist etc. all said I was totally normal and showing zero signs of psychosis. So I went online in the months to follow taking psych tests and even schizophrenia tests and they ALL came back “lowest to zero risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, etc.” So then I didn’t even have anything medical to explain it away. 

I attached the picture I painted of it. It’s NOWHERE NEAR as brilliant as the real thing was. That glowed in such a spectacular fashion. It said nothing either. No words. It was just a feeling of massive peace. And I do have depression (like loads of people), but I genuinely appreciated that feeling. Thinking of it now gives some “oomph” so to speak, but nothing like as I was looking t it. Right then? It just felt like everything was going to be okay. It was strong, but gentle. It was precious and comforting. 

Point is, I don’t know what to think about this or who to trust on it. I will be bringing the framed painting and a letter explaining things to the church itself at some point soon. Honestly i don’t know what a priest or anyone would say about it. I might just be anonymous. I don’t know. Part of me doesn’t want to leave it there at all. My family thinks I’m insane, at least I’m pretty sure as much. So God only knows what that church or priest would think. I mean it sounds insane. 

I guess what I’m saying is what do you think of this? As a kid especially but still now, I’ve been fascinated by several saints as well as the nativity. But I think many little girls and young women as a whole have those interests. Yes though, I have favorite saints even as an agnostic person. I am going through some crisis of faith or spirituality I think. It feels like a “dark night of the soul” kind of thing and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve been reading philosophy, history vs the Bible, etc. I’ve read the Bible itself several times over starting from age 4. Honestly I don’t know what I’m saying. I don’t even know what I saw. I just needed to share. If you have thoughts or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks. 💙 ",19,1761184005.0,Catholicism,6,1.0,False

This girl has a pasive agresive frequent way of speaking to people, specially to me. A couple of months ago we became close friends and I deeply enjoyed her company. She was funny, had a strong personality and seemed to be light in a bottle. Don’t get me wrong, she was mean to others (fat shaming girls, horribly treating waitresses in a coffee shop, being disrespectful towards everyone) but my previous loneliness had forced me to ignore it all just so i could have “friends”. When talking to others about her behavior, I always got the same answer “She’s just mad and gets sick of people easily” as if that justifies deplorable behavior, but I never thought she would get sick of me. 

Until recently i came back from a trip and decided to stop trying to please her all the time; when she would change her personality around boys (shes the definition of pick me) i would point it out, when she would say rude comments like “gosh why does SHE (me) has to come?” On a “sarcastic” way, I would reply by saying how rude that was. Nothing disrespectful from my part, just trying to keep the over all peace and to not wake up the monster that she is. But my self protection has affected me and now all she does is treat me poorly. The problem is most people follow her in a regina gorge type of way and my loneliness is hitting again. But now with hatred from others. This is a typical high school scenario and im so embarrassed i have reached this lack of maturity point but I just wanted to hear advice from someone that has gone throught sm similar.

This is not to stir up feelings, but to let you know Central NC is thinking of you. 
Praying for your rebuild, and hoping that this will help others feel heard in the traumatic experience you all have experienced. 
Thank you, for everything you do for our beautiful mountains and our beautiful state.

Made without Artificial Intelligence.

By Kaylee Godfrey

Rain on a Saturday.
Seems peaceful, at first.
You lie down by the window—
Coffee in hand, music playing.

You start to wonder.
Then—thunder claps!
You slap your mouth in fear.
The lights go black.

The sky and lightning are all you see.
The thunder and rain are all you hear.

Suddenly, the building shakes.
You know—the only thing that will save you, is you.

So, you run.
Down the stairs—
They start shifting beneath you.
Walls collapsing around you.
Rails shaking up and down.

One more floor—then you see it.
Water.
Rushing.
Water.

“No way! This is the mountains!” you say.
You jump—what else could you do?

The cold water smacks you as you gasp.

You wake up.
New place.
New smells.
New pet.
New life.
The one you rebuilt.

After thousands of families torn to pieces, including parts of your own.
After millions of homes—yours among them—
Were completely destroyed by Hurricane Helene.

The PTSD hits you.
Every thunder clap.
Every lightning strike.
Every raindrop.

You remember.
We remember.

1odqs2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/1odqs2g/au_story_the_violet_knight_part_2/,AU Story: The Violet Knight Part 2,"The evening the condo of Sara & Ava was quiet, a stark contrast to the crowded chaos of Titans Tower earlier that day. Sara was sitting on the sofa, nursing a beer, staring absently at the muted news playing on the screen. Ava came out of the bedroom, dressed in comfortable sweats, and sat beside her, gently taking the bottle from Sara’s hand and replacing it with a mug of chamomile tea.

“No more beer, babe. You’ve been quiet ever since we got back.” said Ava.

Sara sighed, ‘I’m just trying to figure out which is weirder: that I was a nanny, or that the timeline chose me to be Bruce Wayne's support staff.”

Ava rubs Sara's shoulder and says, “You shouldn’t be surprised. Before the Legends, before the League, you were always trying to save people. You’re always trying to protect the innocent. This is just a cosmic administrative error that hid your largest, most successful project.”

“It’s not the happy memories that are getting to me, Ava. It's Memory 5. That night at the Batcave, when she was standing there, bleeding, with the Scarecrow toxin in her hand... She was nineteen. She was ready to destroy herself.” said Sara.

“And you stopped her. With a firm voice and a blanket order. You didn't use a fighting move; you used authority.” said Ava.

“I yelled at her to get her ""ass upstairs"" and go to bed. I literally scolded Batgirl like a teenager who missed curfew. And she listened. She called me... ""Mom."" said Sara.

Sara leaned her head against Ava’s shoulder, a wave of exhaustion hitting her. “I don’t remember doing any of that, Ava. I don’t remember giving her unconditional love, or being the person she needed to hear that from. I only remember the mission, the ship, the fighting. But the memories showed it. They showed that Alfred was right, Ellie needed a mother, and somehow, I was it.”

Ava says, “You didn't remember it, Sara, but your soul did. When she opened that portal and showed up here, terrified and clutching those plushies, you didn’t ask for context. You just knew she needed to be safe. That instinct, that Mama Bear thing you have, it’s not an accident or a timeline fluke. It’s fundamentally you. You’re drawn to people who are broken and need someone to remind them they’re worth fixing. Me, Nate, Zari... and now Ellie.”

Sara exhaled, “I just keep thinking about what she said, ""Why does everyone else get to live in the Friendship is Magic?"" She's been carrying the weight of Gotham, of the world's largest company, and of her father's brutal legacy, alone since she was nineteen.”

Ava says, “Well, she's not alone anymore. And we have to stop this Red X threat quickly before he pushes her past that edge again. She’s emotionally compromised, which makes her dangerous to herself and to the mission.” 

Ava shifted, taking Sara’s hand and kissing her knuckles.”Look at those photos, look at those memories. That’s our history, whether we remember the day-to-day details or not. And it means we have a twenty-two year old CEO/football team owner/vigilante running around who now considers the Waverider home. We’re going to need to buy more snacks.”

Sara chuckled softly, pulling Ava close. “More snacks, more tea... and maybe I should finally dig out those old bunny slippers.”

Later that night the condo was dim, the soft glow of Star City’s skyline filtering through the windows. Sara and Ava were curled on the sofa, a half-watched documentary playing, the comfortable silence a familiar balm after a long day. Ava was dozing, her head on Sara’s shoulder, while Sara, despite the calm, felt a familiar, restless hum beneath her skin.

Suddenly, the air in the living room shimmered, crackling with an iridescent purple light. Both women shot upright, Ava’s hand instinctively going for a hidden blade. But Sara's eyes, wide with a sudden, aching recognition, already knew.

Stepping out of the temporal rift was Ellie

She was exactly as she had been on the Waverider, and precisely as she was in the darkest memory of the Batcave. Her pink glasses were perched on her nose, slightly askew. She wore a purple tank top and pink pajama pants with white stars, her feet tucked into absurd, yet deeply comforting, pink fuzzy bunny slippers. Clutched against her chest, as if they were the last vestiges of her childhood, were the worn, familiar forms of her Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise plushies.

But what truly struck Sara was her face. It was utterly devoid of the polished CEO, the hardened vigilante, or even the defiant teenager from the Batcave. It was the face of the nine-year-old girl from the thunderstorm, pure terror and profound sadness etched onto every feature. Her lower lip trembled, and her eyes, magnified by her glasses, glistened with unshed tears.

""Sara...?"" Ellie's voice was a ragged whisper, a small, choked sound that tore at something deep within Sara.

Without a word, Sara was on her feet. She moved across the room, leaving a startled Ava behind. This wasn't a threat; this was her Cub.

Sara didn't ask what was wrong; she didn't need to. She just opened her arms, and Ellie, the formidable Batgirl, the calculating owner of Wayne Enterprises, the unyielding protector of Gotham, stumbled into them.

The 22 year old hero, who carried the weight of an entire city solely on her shoulders, the ""Baby Hero"" in terms of age but the oldest in terms of burden, finally allowed herself to break. She buried her face into Sara's shoulder, the Pokémon plushies squashed between them, and began to sob. Not the quiet, dignified tears of a grieving adult, but the raw, uncontrolled, desperate cries of a daughter who had found her mother, a child finally safe in her Mama Bear's embrace.

Sara held her tight, one hand stroking Ellie's black hair, the other rubbing circles on her back. She closed her eyes, remembering every single memory, every moment of comfort she had provided, every silent promise she had unknowingly made. This wasn't just a friend, not just an ally; this was her Cub, and she would protect her.

Ava watched from the sofa, her own eyes moist. She saw not the White Canary comforting a colleague, but a mother holding her heartbroken child. And in that moment, she understood exactly why Sara had been ""grounded.""

The air in the condo was thick with emotion. Ellie slowly pulled back from the hug, her eyes still red-rimmed but clear behind her glasses. She wiped her face with the sleeve of her tank top, the Pokémon plushies still clutched firmly against her chest. She looked up at Sara, and for the first time that night, the vulnerable nine-year-old completely overshadowed the powerful CEO.

She spoke, not with the deep, cold cadence of Batgirl, but with a quiet, sweet voice that felt like a secret whispered only for Sara.

""I love you."" Ellie said, softly.

The three small words, so easily dismissed in other contexts, struck Sara with the force of a temporal anomaly. Sara Lance, the woman who had faced down assassins, time demons, and gods, was utterly frozen. No threat had ever left her so defenseless.

She looked at the sincere, raw emotion on Ellie’s face, the love that had been suppressed by a timeline error, now rushing to the surface. It wasn't the kind of love you earn with missions or saves; it was the foundational, unwavering love a daughter holds for the person who kept her safe in the dark.

Sara’s own throat tightened, a rare, unfamiliar lump of pure, overwhelming feeling. She didn't hesitate for long. She reached out, gently pushing the glasses up the bridge of Ellie’s nose, and cupped her cheek.

Sara smiled, ""I love you too, Cubbie.""

It was a quiet, absolute confirmation. Sara pulled Ellie back in for a softer, lingering hug, sealing the bond that time, death, and a cosmic crisis had all failed to erase.

The morning light in the condo was warm and peaceful.
The guest room door finally opened, and Ellie shuffled out, the anxiety that had marked her face the night before was softened by sleep.

Ava, who was pouring a fresh cup of coffee, smiled warmly. ""Hey, kiddo.""

Sara, already seated at the dining table, offered a look of deep relief. ""Hey, Cubbie. How did you sleep?""

Ellie pulled up a chair and slumped into it. ""Good.""

Sara reached across the table, taking Ellie’s hand in her own. ""That’s nice to hear.""

Ava smiled, ""You hungry?""

Ellie looked up at Ava, a faint glimmer of a smile appearing. ""Can you make pancakes?""

""Sure. Pancakes it is."" Ava walked into the kitchen, already humming.

The moment the background noise of running water started, Ellie leaned forward, her voice dropping to an intimate whisper meant only for Sara.

""Mom, thank you for saving me. Stopping me from going into Arkham that night.""

Sara squeezed her hand, her eyes locked with Ellie's. ""Any time, Cubbie. Always.""

The happy, domestic moment dissolved instantly.
Ellie pushed the empty plate away, a satisfied sigh escaping her. ""Wow, Ava, those were actually good. You’re definitely a better cook than Alfred.""

Ava chuckled, pleased. ""High praise! See, Sara, I do have useful skills outside of time management.""

Before Sara could respond, a low, urgent, and encrypted chime echoed from the pocket of Ellie’s pajama pants. It was a stark, dissonant sound in the cozy condo.

Ellie’s entire demeanor snapped. The soft, relaxed ""Cub"" vanished. Her hand shot to her pocket, pulling out a sleek, black smartphone—obviously a customized communications device and her eyes narrowed as they scanned the feed. The transition from grateful daughter to relentless vigilante was instantaneous and chilling to watch.

Ava's Voice tightening, ""Is that it? Red X?""

Ellie shook her head, staring at the screen, her lips pressed into a thin line. She spoke quietly, the casual violence of the statement completely jarring against the fluffy pink slippers on her feet.

Ellie says, No. Just Gotham. It's Harley Quinn."" She paused, her thumb flying across the screen. ""She's robbing the Gotham National Bank with a dozen goons. Standard chaos.""

The fact that bank robbery by a maniac clown was considered ""standard chaos"" in Ellie's life hung heavy in the air.
The air was tense. Ellie, still in her pajamas but now standing ramrod straight, finished scanning the details of the bank robbery.

""I've got to go."" said Ellie.

She moved instinctively towards the temporal portal device on her wrist, her mind already on the fastest route back to the Batcave to suit up.

""Hold on."" said Sara

Sara stepped into her path, her voice calm but leaving absolutely no room for argument, the voice of a Captain and, now, a mother. “After the memories we just watched, after seeing those emotions brought back to the surface... there is no way in hell I'm letting you walk into Gotham alone to fight the Joker's ex-girlfriend. Not today.""

Ellie paused, the sharp, defensive retort dying on her tongue. The authority in Sara’s eyes was undeniable, backed by the history they both now shared. She dropped her gaze.

Ellie sighed, ""Okay, Mom.""

The simple compliance spoke volumes. Ellie didn't argue the tactical merit; she accepted the emotional mandate.

Sara gave her a quick, supportive shoulder squeeze. ""Good. Let's make this quick.""

The next five minutes were a blur of organized chaos. The calm domesticity of the condo was shattered by the whir and flash of two of the world's most formidable vigilantes preparing for battle.

Ellie, moving with speed that belied her bunny slippers, retrieved a utility pouch and a change of clothes from a temporal pocket hidden in the guest room. She stripped off the pajamas and swiftly pulled on her streamlined Batgirl suit, black Kevlar, sharp angles, and the heavy utility belt that spoke of serious intent. Her pink glasses were traded for the cowl.

Sara was equally fast, pulling on her own White Canary uniform. The white leather, designed for freedom of movement, contrasted sharply with the bulk of Batgirl’s armor, symbolizing their different approaches to combat.

As they both stood in the living room, fully armored and ready to face a psycho clown, the contrast was striking: one in stark white, the other in deep black and yellow accents, two timelines, two legacies, now fused by a singular, fierce, family bond.

Sara says, ""Coordinates set. We take the temporal shortcut to the Gotham City docks, two minutes from the bank. Non-lethal takedowns, Cub. Harley's not worth the prison break hassle.""

Ellie, Her voice was a low, synthesized rasp, professional and steady. ""Understood, Mom. Gotham National is three blocks up from our drop point. She's cornered.""

Sara activated her temporal device, the familiar purple portal tearing open the fabric of reality. ""Let's go, Batgirl. Time to show Gotham's clown who her Mama Bear is.""

The two heroes stepped through the shimmering gateway and vanished, leaving behind only the scent of fresh coffee and the quiet hum of a now-empty condo.

The lobby of the Gotham National Bank was a scene of colorful, destructive chaos. Glass glittered across the marble floor, and four of Harley's goons were gleefully loading sacks of cash, supervised by Harley herself. She was perched atop the main teller counter, swinging a massive cartoon mallet and addressing the terrified, huddled hostages.

""Alright, puppies! Just a few more bags and we'll call this a perfect field trip! Now, who wants a souvenir selfie with their favorite—"" Harley commended.

A blast of wind and a blinding flash of white and black dropped into the center of the lobby. Batgirl landed silently, armor absorbing the impact. Next to her, White Canary landed in a dynamic crouch, her collapsible fighting staff snapping instantly into place. Sara was wearing a sleek, white mask with smooth gold lenses that perfectly hid her identity.

Harley’s wide, painted grin faltered. She squinted, tipping her head.

""Oh, hey, Batgirl! Back so soon? Did ya miss me? Ooh, and who’s yer date? A new flavor of bird? Wait... the white? The moves... that's White Canary, ain't it? From the TV news!""

Harley jumped down, tapping the mallet on the floor. ""What, did Star City run out of crime, sweetie? You flew all the way here just to watch Batsy Junior get her butt kicked? Aw, that’s just rude!""

Ellie her voice tight, ignoring Harley. ""Take the center group. I’ll take the vault crew.""

""On it, Cub. Remember the objective."" said Sara.

The fight exploded. Sara was pure, lethal efficiency, a whirling blur of white and staff strikes. She targeted joints and wrists, disarming three goons in under four seconds, never letting a single punch stray from non-lethal zones. Her speed made her untouchable.

Ellie, however, fought with controlled, devastating force. She used the environment, kicking a marble desk into the legs of a charging goon, then using the impact to springboard onto another. Her movements were fueled by the raw, barely contained rage from the night before, making her hits heavy and merciless.

One large goon, wielding a crowbar, tried to swing wide at Ellie’s head. Ellie ducked the swing and delivered a precise, sickening crunch of an elbow strike to his sternum. He dropped, choking for air. Ellie immediately stepped over him, moving to the next target, but she delivered a gratuitously hard kick to the downed man’s ribs as she passed.

A shadow appeared between her and the stunned goon. Sara, moving faster than the eye could track, had inserted herself mid-stride.

Quietly, the stern ‘Mom’ voice filtering through the mask, ""Batgirl. Control.""

Ellie paused, her next strike freezing mid-air. She took a deep, shaky breath, the memory of Sara telling her to stand down at the Batcave flooding back. She nodded, wordless, and redirected her energy to the vault door instead.

Harley, who had been observing the fight with maniacal delight, saw the exchange. She recognized the intimate, commanding tone and the Batgirl’s instant compliance.

Harley smirked, ""Ooh! Mommy doesn’t like it when you play too rough, Batgirl? What's the deal, Canary? You runnin' a daycare in your off-hours?""

Harley swung her mallet, forcing a direct confrontation. Sara met the oversized weapon with her staff, the sharp crack echoing through the bank. Sara, stronger than she looked, held the mallet steady.

Sara said, ""You're done, Quinn. The party's over.""

""Nah, the party's just starting!""

Harley pulled a handful of exploding glitter bombs from her belt and tossed them high. As they detonated in flashes of pink and blue smoke, Batgirl launched a sonic batarang, timed perfectly to pierce the center of the cloud. The batarang found its target: Harley’s ankle.

Harley shrieked, collapsing into the cloud of smoke. When Batgirl cleared the air with a flash grenade, Harley was already handcuffed and linked to a heavy ATM machine.

Harley was panting, but still grinning, ""You got fast, Batsy. But you got soft, Canary. All that mother-hen energy... it makes ya predictable!""

Sara stepped close, her gold lenses reflecting Harley's wide, blue eyes.

Softly, dangerously, ""No. It makes me dangerous. You touch her, Quinn, you won't like what happens next.""

Sara turned away before Harley could respond, walking over to Ellie, who was already securing the last of the goons, her expression hard. She looked at the destroyed bank lobby, then at Sara.

Ellie pressed a finger to her gauntlet, ""Harley secured. Loot retrieved. Local police were alerted.""

Sara smiled,  ""Good job, Cub. Now, let's get you home.”

Sara reached out and gently took Ellie’s armored hand. Ellie squeezed back tightly, the raw vulnerability momentarily replacing the cowl’s grim resolve. The job was done, but the healing had just begun. The temporal rift opened, bathing the two vigilantes in purple light as they left the standard chaos of Gotham behind for the quiet sanctuary of their condo.

The police sirens of the GCPD were closing in, a familiar sound in Gotham that meant the immediate clean-up was underway. Batgirl confirmed her location one last time, ensuring all remaining goons were secured.

Ellie smiled, ""My ride is here. Let's go.""

She tapped a specific button on her gauntlet, sending an encrypted signal. Seconds later, gliding around the corner of a ruined building was a piece of automotive art: a custom, low-slung Lamborghini Temerario, coated in a stunning, deep midnight purple bulletproof armor that absorbed the city lights, accented with subtle, rich gold trim. It looked less like a crime-fighting vehicle and more like a high-speed, personalized stealth fighter. The side door lifted silently, revealing the lavish interior. The two women walked swiftly toward the car, the powerful machine idling with a low growl.

They slid inside the cabin, Ellie in the driver's seat and Sara in the passenger seat. Sara removed her mask, running a hand over the expensive leather dash. She looked at the personalized command console, a far cry from the bulky, rugged look of a traditional Batmobile.

""Cool."" said Sara.

Ellie, still in her cowl, looked across at Sara. Her body language shifted instantly; the tense shoulders relaxed, and a spark of genuine, youthful pride lit up her eyes. Her synthesized voice was replaced by a quick, excited rush of words.

Ellie smirked, ""Welcome to my Batmobile.""

Sara turned to look fully at her daughter. Ellie’s gaze was fixed on the road, but her mouth, visible beneath the edge of the cowl, stretched into a mischievous smirk. Then, quickly, playfully, the Batgirl stuck her tongue out at her passenger. It was the fleeting, unguarded gesture of the nine-year-old from the memories, a sign that the Cub was truly home.

The grin vanished as quickly as it came. Ellie slammed the car into gear, the twin turbos spooling up with an aggressive whine. The purple-and-gold Lamborghini roared away from the scene, disappearing into the maze of Gotham’s streets, heading for the hidden entrance of the Batcave.

In Star Labs, Cisco was hunched over the main console, his fingers flying across the holographic keyboards. Barry stood nearby, restless energy radiating off him, while Caitlin reviewed Ellie's medical files, looking for physiological signs of Zynothium exposure.

​Cisco suddenly stopped typing, leaning back with a sharp exhale. His expression was a mix of disbelief and frustration. ""Okay, forget about Red X for a second. I was trying to backtrack the material signature of the Zynothium core Ellie brought, looking for any comparable elements in the global tech database. That element shouldn't even exist in our dimension, but I found a local connection that's making my alarm bells ring.""

​Barry zipped closer, concerned about etching his face. ""A local connection to a meta-dimensional super-element? Who is it, Cisco?""

​Caitlin, Looking up from her tablet, ""What is it?""

​Cisco turned to face them, his eyes wide, ""He’s uncovered that Mercury Labs has a secret.""

​Caitlin frowned, ""Mercury Labs? Are you serious? Tina McGee runs that place. It's one of the most respected research facilities on the Eastern Seaboard. What kind of secret?""

​Cisco just stared at them, his voice dropping to a low, heavy whisper.

""Zynothium.”

The holographic screens in the Cortex suddenly flashed from deep blue to an urgent, strobing red. A piercing security alert blared, silencing the tension that lingered after Cisco's Zynothium revelation.

​""It's an active intrusion alert! Central City Police Department feed… It’s Mercury Labs!"" yelled Cisco.

​Barry says, ""He's making his move! He must have been tracking the Zynothium supply chain.""

​""He’s going for the source. If he gets access to their entire supply..."" said, Caitlin.

​""We're done talking. Suit up!"" Barry said, sternly.

​In a flash of red and two swift movements, Barry, Cisco, and Caitlin were in their suits. Barry prepared to take off, but a sudden flash of purple energy erupted right next to the containment field.

​From the shimmering temporal portal stepped Ellie and Sara both fully armored.

""We got the same alert. The signal signature matched an old WayneTech black op frequency."" said Ellie.

​""We’re going in. Together."" said Sara.

​The halls of Mercury Labs were quiet, aside from the low moan of two security guards slumped against a wall, victims of precise, non-lethal strikes. The five heroes found the main research vault door hanging wide open, smoke still curling from the edges where it had been cleanly sliced.

​Inside the vault, standing before an open, reinforced case that once held rare chemical elements, was Red X. He held a sleek, silver container of shimmering, metallic dust. He turned, the reflective, black X across his mask giving off a cold glare.

​""Well, the gang’s all here. And you’ve added a bird."" Red X, said snarkly.

​Sara leveled her staff, moving instantly to flank Ellie. Barry stood ready, vibrating slightly, while Cisco prepared his gauntlets.

​""Red X! What are you planning on doing with that Zynothium? Turn cities into craters?"" Barry asked.

​Red X threw his head back in a short, harsh laugh. ""Please. I’m just a thief, Flash, not a psychopath. I came here to get enough to keep powering the suit, and then I’m going to sell the rest to the highest bidder. I like money; explosions are messy.""

​He made a sudden movement with his free hand, slapping an invisible panel on the wall near the vault's entrance. This was clearly meant to activate the lab's integrated meta-dampeners.

​Nothing happened.

​Red X tried again, rapidly hitting the area. Still nothing. He paused, his head tilting slightly as he realized he’d been played.

​Cisco with A genuine, delighted smirk under his mask, ""Looks like you're out of juice there, pal. I rerouted all your network access the second you stepped on the property. We were expecting you.""

​Cornered, Red X knew brute force was useless against the combined might of a speedster, Frost, a Canary, and Batgirl. He slammed his fist down, and a shimmer of red energy enveloped him.

​""He's teleporting! Get on him, Barry!"" Caitlin yelled.

​Barry didn't wait, taking off at impossible speed. He materialized an instant later, not back in the vault, but on the exposed rooftop of Mercury Labs, just as Red X was trying to force open his suit’s hidden compartment.

​""It's over, X! There’s nowhere else to run."" said Barry.

​Red X, breathing heavily, pulled two small, heavy-looking vials from his belt. One was the container he had just grabbed, the other was a small, sealed vial of raw, unstable Zynothium powder.

​""Not yet."" said Red X throwing a vial.

​The moment the vial left his hand, it detonated with a high-pitched CRACK and a searing flash of crimson light and smoke. The localized explosion threw both Barry and the surrounding equipment back.

​When the thick, red smoke dispensed moments later, Red X was gone, a successful teleport this time, using the explosion to mask his energy signature.

​Barry staggered up, shaking his head clear, and immediately scanned the area. The massive, cylindrical container that held the bulk of Mercury Labs' Zynothium stores was thankfully still there, untouched. Red X had only managed to take what he needed to refuel, and the single vial he sacrificed for the escape.

​The rest of the team zipped up the elevator shaft to the roof.

​Ellie, Kneeling next to the scorched pavement, ""He's gone. But the primary core is intact. It looks like he got what he wanted: enough fuel to vanish.""

​Sara sighed, ""He’s a ghost now, Cubbie. A ghost with an active power source.”

The five heroes stood in the Cortex, the adrenaline of the rooftop confrontation fading into residual tension. Barry was out of his suit, Caitlin stood by the medical console, and Cisco hunched over the main screen. Sara had her white leather jacket zipped up, and Ellie had slipped off her cowl, revealing her tired, glasses-wearing face.

Cisco frustrated, throwing his hands up, ""Zero. Zippo. That crimson flash was brilliant, tactically, a perfect temporal-spatial cloaking agent. There's no sign of Red X anywhere in the city. He’s gone cold.""

Ellie, leaning against the console, professional again, ""He won't stay hidden for long. He needs money and resources to maintain the suit and move that stolen Zynothium. He’ll resurface.""

Barry stepped away from the monitors, focusing entirely on Ellie. He knew, better than most, what deep trauma could do to a hero.

""Hey. Are you okay?"" Barry asked in a soft tone.

Ellie looked at him, her gaze surprisingly steady. She was speaking to the Flash, but the answer was for herself and Sara.

""I'll get there. And don't worry, you won't be seeing reports of Batgirl dropping bodies in Arkham. I'll be fine."" said Ellie.

The dark humor referenced the raw rage from Memory 5, acknowledging the darkness without giving into it.

Caitlin, who had observed the entire dynamic between Ellie and Sara over the last twelve hours, smiled softly, injecting a much-needed dose of levity.

""Well, you do have a mommy now."" Caitlin teased.

Sara, who had just been taking a sip of water, nearly sprayed it across the console. She spun around, her face instantly turning a deep shade of pink.

Sara's eyes went wide, ""Oh, my God, Caitlin! No, stop it!"" She buried her face in her hands for a moment, genuinely mortified.

Ellie, however, simply took a deep breath, and for the first time since leaving the condo, a genuine, easy smile touched her lips. ""She's not wrong.""

Felicity was glued to the Arrowcomputer console, which had been temporarily linked to Star City's global security grid. Diggle, Thea, and Laurel were gathered around her.

​Felicity's Eyes scanning the multiple monitors, ""No sign in Star City of everyone's new Red X friend. He’s running a deep stealth protocol, the Zynothium is acting like a perfect kinetic and thermal dampener.""

​""Slade must have caused a lot of stress on Dick if he had to make that suit to go undercover. Using the Zynothium just makes him faster and harder to find."" said Thea.

​""And where did he even find the Zynothium supply in the first place? It's supposed to be fictional."" Laurel asked.

""I can at least answer that question."" Felicity said, pulling up a picture on the main display: an older Asian man with white hair, a precise goatee, and a slightly manic look, wearing a sleek, white high-tech suit. ""Dick sent this file over. Meet Professor Chang, the creator of Zynothium.""

​""Where is Chang now?"" Diggle asked.

​""Currently underground. Deep, deep underground. Apparently, Red X spooked him badly, and Chang decided he didn't want the Titans knocking down his door, so he vanished with his remaining R&D."" Felicity answered.

​Before anyone could speculate further, a brilliant flash of violet energy ignited near the weapons rack. ​Sara and Ellie stepped out of the temporal portal, both in comfortable, casual clothing. Ellie was wearing her signature ensemble: pink shoes, black leggings, a purple skirt, a light blue t-shirt, and a purple zip-up hoodie. Her pink-framed glasses were back on, giving her a more youthful, approachable appearance. She held an old-school DVD case.

​Laurel smiled, walking toward them. ""This is different. You clean up nicely, Ellie.""

​""I wanted to drop this off before I go do my fun day job."" Ellie indicated the DVD.

​""What is it?"" Diggle asked.

​""It's one of a handful of tapes I found in a hidden section of my dad's safe. This one... it's of my dad and Oliver. In his office."" Ellie answered.

​Ellie inserted the DVD into the Arrowcomputer’s disc drive, and the main screen switched to a video feed.

​Video Playback: Wayne Tower Office 13 Years Ago

​The footage was clear but slightly grainy. A younger Bruce was sitting behind his enormous desk, uncharacteristically relaxed. Oliver stood opposite him, leaning forward slightly, looking annoyed.

​""So Sara told me that your nine-year-old said you call me a little shit."" Oliver said annoyed.

​Bruce, Bluntly, without a hint of apology, ""If the shoe fits.""

​Oliver raising his voice,""Oh, is that right?""

​""You're highly emotional, Oliver. You lead with your heart and your fists in equal measure."" Bruce said, sternly.

​Oliver put his hands flat on the desk. ""At least I have emotions, unlike you. Sometimes I wonder, are you even a person?""

​A flicker of genuine anger appeared on Bruce’s face, but he kept his voice controlled and low. ""I only allow two people to see me without my masks on, Oliver: Alfred and my little girl.""

​Oliver asked, ""Speaking of your daughter, why do you keep hiring Sara as her nanny? The security risk—""

​Bruce exhaled, the anger leaving his face, replaced by a deep, tired resignation. His expression softened.

​""Because Ellie has formed a bond with Sara. A mother-daughter bond, which is something that Ellie doesn't have. Something that she needs."" Bruce paused, the next words laced with contemptuous regret. ""She needs it because Selina doesn't want the responsibility of that role. She still wants to commit heists across the world instead of spending time with the child she helped make.""

​Oliver was genuinely surprised, the shock silencing his usual arrogance. This was pure, genuine emotion from Bruce Wayne. ""Sara is a great person. She has her baggage, but she has a great heart. Ellie's in great hands, Bruce."" Oliver said, softly.

​The tape ended there.

​The Shockwave was sent through the Arrowcave, Felicity quickly made multiple copies of the file to send to all the other hero teams, including The Titans, Team Flash, and the DEO, a valuable piece of evidence confirming that Bruce Wayne, while complicated, possessed a deep, heart beneath his armor.

​In S.T.A.R. Labs

​Cisco, who had remotely received the file from Felicity, watched the video play out for Barry and Caitlin.

​As the final, crucial line of dialogue—""...Selina doesn't want the responsibility... with the child she helped make""—echoed through the Cortex, a realization hit Cisco with the force of a sonic boom.

​Cisco jumped up, eyes wide with incredulity, ""Hold up! Bruce said Selina, as in Selina Kyle! The Catwoman is Ellie's birth mom!?""

​In Titans Tower

​Dick Grayson stood alone, watching the same feed. He finished the video, then stared at the blank screen for a long time. The tape explained everything about his own failures and Ellie's history in a single, gut-wrenching moment.

""Selina... Sara... I was so focused on the mask, I missed the fact that Bruce was trying to build a family. And he went to Sara to do it. The mother she needed…” Dick said to himself.

Kara and Alex were sprawled on the sofa, a half-empty bowl of popcorn resting between them. The apartment was quiet except for the hum of the TV, which now displayed the paused image of a younger  Bruce and Oliver.

​Kara picks up a kernel of popcorn, speaking softly. “He looked so tired, Alex. Bruce. When he talked about Selina choosing the heists over Ellie. He was so angry, but mostly… heartbroken.”

​Alex, nodding, pulling a blanket higher, “He was. And it validates what Sara did. Bruce, the most paranoid, controlling person on the planet, willingly handed his daughter’s emotional development over to a former League of Assassins member because he knew the mother-daughter connection was real. That’s staggering, Kara.”

“He could have hired the best therapists, the most expensive child care… but he needed Sara. The fact that she was the only other person, besides Alfred, he showed his face to… that’s loyalty, but it’s also loneliness.” said Kara.

​“It explains Ellie perfectly. She has Bruce’s duty, Selina’s flair for drama, and Sara’s heart. She’s chaos wrapped in purpose. We need to make sure the DEO focuses on protecting that bond, not scrutinizing it.” said Alex.

​Kara nodded, leaning her head on Alex’s shoulder. “Agreed. If Sara’s her grounding wire, we need to make sure nobody cuts it.”

​Clark & Lois were in their living room with many questions in their minds, They had just finished watching the DVD copy sent by Felicity.

​Lois leaned back on the couch, folding her arms.

“Selina Kyle. Of course. It explains the car, the agility, and the flair for the dramatic exit. I covered Catwoman enough to know she’s always chosen the thrill over the responsibility. Bruce was right to be angry, but he’s not innocent either. He knew who she was when he got involved.”

​Clark, Looking down at the floor, his voice laced with understanding.

“He did. But he was struggling with being a father, Lois. That admission to Oliver, that he only takes his mask off for Alfred and his little girl, that’s the closest Bruce ever came to saying, ‘I am drowning, and I need help.’ He wasn’t asking Oliver for assistance; he was justifying why he was desperate enough to rely on Sara.”

Lois sighed, ​“It makes the whole situation tragic. Two legends dead, and one's daughter is left with the world’s biggest company, the most volatile city, and a mother figure who vanished from her memory. And her actual mother is probably somewhere in Monte Carlo counting diamonds.”

​Clark walked over to the window, looking out over the sleeping city. “It tells us what we need to know about Ellie. She isn’t just carrying Batman’s legacy; she’s carrying Bruce Wayne’s deepest secret: love. And we need to protect that secret, no matter what Red X is planning.”

​Lois stood up, walking to stand beside him. “We will. But first, I’m digging into Professor Chang. If he’s hiding Zynothium, he knows exactly who Red X is.”

In Mallorca, Spain, Selina was in her Luxurious Coastal Villa in the early hours of the night as the Mediterranean breeze drifted through the open balcony doors of Selina Kyle's opulent villa, carrying the scent of salt and blooming jasmine. She reclined on a plush chaise lounge, a crystal glass of Merlot in her hand, the soft glow of a massive holographic display projecting from a discreet device on her coffee table. On the screen, a news report from Gotham played.

​The footage showed Batgirl and White Canary in action: Batgirl's fluid, powerful strikes against Harley's goons, the precise, disarming elegance of White Canary. The report praised their efficiency, the seamless coordination, the quiet power they exuded as they efficiently neutralized the threat.

​Selina watched Batgirl move, a flicker of pride and recognition in her emerald eyes. Her movements, her stance, the sheer, ruthless effectiveness… it was Bruce. But the subtle flair, the occasional acrobatic flourish, the almost playful shift in momentum… that was all her.

​Then, the White Canary moved into frame, her fighting style a whirlwind of grace and lethal precision. Selina’s brow furrowed. She knew the White Canary’s reputation, a former assassin, now a respected hero.

The news anchor’s voice changed, transitioning to a different segment. ""And in other breaking news, exclusive images and footage have surfaced, revealing a secret, deep bond between Gotham's Princess Helena Wayne and Star City's Sara Lance.""

​The holographic display changed, showing the images that had been sent across the World:
​Young Ellie in her pink and purple room, laughing with a younger, softer Sara Lance.
​Sara holding Ellie during the thunderstorm, a protective embrace.
​The formal picture of Oliver, Bruce, Sara, and Ellie.
​The image of a 13-year-old Ellie talking confidentially with Sara.
​And finally, a still from the Bruce and Oliver DVD, with Bruce's face etched with pain as he spoke of Selina choosing ""heists across the world instead of spending time with the child she helped make.""

​Selina’s grip tightened on her wine glass until her knuckles were white. Her relaxed posture vanished. The smooth, unblemished mask of the elusive Catwoman cracked.

​The montage of memories played out, showing Sara Lance as Ellie's ""Mama Bear,"" her confidante, her protector. Selina watched Ellie call Sara ""Mom"", the raw emotion on the young woman's face.

​A guttural sound, a mix of shock and a wounded animal's growl, escaped Selina’s lips. She slowly lowered the wine glass to the table, her eyes still fixed on the screen, now showing Ellie and Sara in a comforting embrace.

​Her initial reaction was a cold, sharp spike of jealousy. Not just any woman, but Sara Lance had stepped into the role Selina had consciously, repeatedly, chosen to abandon. She saw the love, the fierce protectiveness, the deep, emotional connection that radiated from Sara, and she saw it reflected in Ellie's vulnerable, desperate need.

​Then came the regret. A tidal wave of it. Not just for Bruce’s harsh words, but for the truth behind them. She had always justified her choices, her freedom, her life on the edge. But seeing this… seeing her daughter find solace, security, and a mother’s love in someone else's arms, someone who wasn't her... it was a wound deeper than any Bruce Wayne had ever inflicted.

​She touched the holographic image, her fingers hovering over Ellie's tear-stained face. Her daughter, whom she loved in her own wild, untamed way, had needed a stable anchor, and Selina had been unwilling, or perhaps simply unable, to be that.

​A single, unbidden tear tracked a path down Selina's perfectly made-up cheek. It was a rare, raw display of vulnerability. She had thought she was making choices for herself, for her freedom. But in her absence, another had stepped in, filling a void Selina had created. And for the first time in a very long time, Selina Kyle, the untouchable Catwoman, felt the crushing weight of a consequence she couldn't outrun or steal her way out of. She stared at the image of Sara, her eyes hardening, a new, complex resolve forming. The Mama Bear had claimed her cub. And Selina, the biological mother, was now an outsider looking in.",1,1761183754.0,Arrowverse,0,1.0,False

A few years ago I developed air hunger. (Along with a ton of other symptoms). I am constantly yawning/taking deep breaths because I feel like I’m not “catching” the right breath. I get these flare ups that last a few weeks at a time. And when it hits, it SUCKS. I eventually start getting a little wheeze because I’m like hurting my lungs doing this. I have had a full workup with a pulmonologist who thinks this is a long Covid symptom. (June 2022 covid). 

I’ve noticed caffeine makes these spells significantly worse. If I have a cup of coffee in the morning, my whole day is consumed with an air hunger spell. Does this happen to anyone else? It’s driving me insane. I just want my coffee again 😢",2,1761183739.0,dysautonomia,0,0.75,False
1odqrh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1odqrh1/doctor_said_what_i_have_sounds_like_gastroparesis/,Doctor said what I have sounds like gastroparesis. Will it go away?,"I asked my doctor for some painkillers for pain management and they gave me ibuprofen. I ended up getting my period (I have PCOS) and the period pains were SO bad so I ended up taking ibuprofen. She also gave me another pill to take with the ibuprofen, called omeprazole, bc the ibuprofen can irritate your stomach. For reference, before this I never took ibuprofen. I’m a Panadol or neurofen girly, and when I’ve got my period before, have taken Panadol and codeine (only thing that stops the pain). None of this has caused any stomach issues before. 

Anyways, even after my period finishes, I now have new pains to contend with, and this pain is in my stomach. It also makes me feel so bloated, easily full/ not hungry, and is so bad that I feel like I have to lay down. Like it takes energy to sit up. So I thought it was gastroparesis, and without mentioning this word, I was describing all these symptoms to my doctor and she said it was this. It’s also super strange since stomach pains/ aches have not been a thing I’ve gotten much in my life — period pains and headaches are the types of random bodily pains I get. So it was weird that this was suddenly happening. 

But I’m now looking it up on line and it says gastroparesis doesn’t go away? Like it’s a chronic condition? Is this true even if it is induced by medications, ie the ibuprofen? I started to wonder if it was the ibuprofen and stopped taking it maybe three days ago. I also thought milk was to blame and stopped drinking this, but then tested it out a bit after this and was okay. I thought I was okay/ fine/ cured and then today I had some water and food and afterwards began to feel sicker and sicker, which is weird bc I’d also previously had a coffee, a banana, water and a bit of chocolate. So breakfast didn’t trigger it but me having lunch did? I’m now on the bed waiting to feel less bloated and for the pain to go away. 

I also saw stuff like codeine and amitrptaline can also increase gastroparesis. I’m wondering if the Panadol and codeine I took plus the ibuprofen when I was on my period contributed to the sudden gastroparesis. I also take 5mg of amitryptaline every night, and since I’ve been feeling more anxious lately, my doctor said I should take 10mg per night. But wouldn’t this exacerbate the symptoms of gastroparesis? I took 10mg last night — is that why I’m feeling like this today? 

I also take citalopram every night, as well as oratane. And I take Ritalin every day for my adhd, but have only been taking this for about three months, and the Ritalin never caused any stomach issues before. 

Idk, any help/ advice/ knowledge would be appreciated! She kind of just said this and idk if it means the gastroparesis will go away or if I now have a chronic illness. I also still have some of the omeprazole she prescribed me but I can’t find it anywhere in my room. I took an anti-nausea pill but have just been lying down waiting for it to go away.

I am a barista with 232 numbers, so I've been around for a minute. Not super relevant to the story, but i think it's good to have that context. Yesterday, I had someone come through the drive thru and order a grande brown-sugar shaken espresso with one extra pump of brown sugar in a venti cup with oatmilk filled to the top. I informed her that I couldn't do that since that would make the drink just a venti, which, silly me, I thought would be a reasonable response. Her response to me, however, indicated that I apparently committed some severe crime. She told me that because she didn't want the same amount of espresso as the venti one that it didn't make the drink a venti. Unless I have missed some critical communication from corporate, I'm pretty sure sizes are still based off of the volume of liquid in the drink. I informed her of that which she didn't take kindly to either and asked what I was going to do for her since she really doesn't like the taste of coffee, which is a whole other thing that I ignored in order to try and wrap my head around the logic this person had of going to a place asking to get a larger size and pay for a smaller one. I wonder if this person goes out to eat and tells servers at restaurants ""I want to order the prime rib, but I'm not going to eat the whole thing because I don't like meat that much. You need to charge me just for a side of fries."" Anyway, the story ends with me offering to fill it with a little more milk and maybe adding some extra ice and her rolling her eyes and going ""ugh"" before pulling up to the window. Nothing crazy, but I figured a few people in this subreddit would get a chuckle from this ridiculous interaction.

I (28, f) think he just doesn't want to have the responsibility himself which I can understand but I don't see why it has to be my job instead. I never volunteered for it or even expressed interest in it, so I think the reason he's targeting me is because I'm the youngest in the office. 

Everyone in the office thinks it's a huge joke but I think the guy himself means it and genuinely, I find it annoying and off putting. I feel like a tool because everyone is having a good laugh but I'm not playing along at all. I don't find it funny to have an extra responsibility, even if they're not actually serious about it. Like, I wouldn't mind making an extra cup if someone asks and I'm already on the task, but the way he says it is as if he expects me to make coffee for everyone in the office whenever they want and that's not my job description. 

How do I tell him to back off without sounding like a jerk?",31,1761183342.0,work,59,0.88,False

I have done a lot of community volunteering, and a lot of activitism - advocating for students and teachers to our local government. I am very active in my community, a lot of people know me, but when I say they ""know me"" I mean that they probably brought me a meal when my baby was born (because meal trains are common in my community), or have chatted with me while volunteering at a school or girl scout event, or at the library where I used to be a chair on the friends of the library board. I'd guess that I ""know"" at least 1/4 of the locals by name, more by face, and most by some form of association. I also had a public profile on facebook where I would share events, updates, photos and had a relatively public persona prior to locking it down about 3 years ago - people who were ""following"" before can still see, but I rarely post more than a holiday greeting these days.

In 2020 I went back to school, got my MSW, and now I am working under supervision. I have talked to my supervisor, and I am not 100% sold on her interpretation of the rules/concepts. For about a refer I referred out any one who lived in the same area as me. This week I've had three different people reach out to ask if I'm accepting clients. These are people I would gladly talk to in the school pick up zone, but I've never like, grabbed coffee with them, or asked them for help. I'm a trusted and well known person in my community, and I'm wondering - do I HAVE to turn down people like these?  They likely are a ""facebook friend"", because most of my community is connected on facebook. I also have just always been a very outgoing and friendly person, so there are many people who consider me a friend because I will talk to almost any one, and am good at ""rapport building"" as it's called in our line of work. My husband likes to say I've never met a stranger. 

So yeah... I will try to put it more succinctly. Is it considered a dual relationship to treat a person (or the child of that person) who I know through my community, considering how tight-knit and familiar my local community is? ",1,1761183289.0,therapists,5,1.0,False
1odqltq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1odqltq/grandmas_mansion_of_many_stories/,Grandma’s Mansion of Many Stories,"I’ve been lurking here for a while and figured I’d share some stories of my grandma’s mansion in Brazil. My grandma passed away 2 years ago. I miss her dearly. Her house has been for sale since.

Her house was built right around the turn of the 20th century. No one ever gave me a specific year, but it was agreed that it was late 1890s to early 1900s.
It was originally built when the town was mainly fields and coffee farms. It’s a very congested city now.

My grandma moved into the house when her 5 children were already grown. My grandpa had passed years earlier and she traded their coffee farm for the house. She lived there for about 40 years by herself, with a couple of my uncles who stayed with her often for company and helped her manage expenses.

An elderly lady had lived in the house prior to my grandma moving in. The story is that she was very kind and passed away peacefully, but it seems she never truly left the house.

This home was truly massive. Two kitchens, two dining rooms, one with an 18 person dining table, marble floors, a library, bar, wine cellar, multiple sitting rooms, walls covered in giant oil paintings, a 5ft wide marble winder stairway, huge covered back patio with brick bbq, and a separate 3-room structure in the backyard. It was a beauty of a home (sadly it fell into disrepair). All the grandkids grew up hearing our parents, aunts, uncles talking about their experiences in the house.

During breakfast one morning, I was sitting with my mom and my grandma as they were talking about some confusion they each encountered in the middle of the night.
So, one thing to note, every single night my grandma would leave a silver tray on a table in the upstairs landing with a pitcher of water and some glasses, in case anyone got thirsty in the middle of the night. The landing looked directly down the large winder marble staircase, so you couldn’t see down around the corner of the stairs.
My grandma said she went out to drink some water in the middle of the night, and noticed it was empty and thought my mom had gone downstairs to fill another pitcher, and that my grandma thought she heard my mom on the stairs but didn’t see her. My mom just said, “What? I thought you were the one getting water. I thought I heard YOU walking up the stairs.” Now my grandma is all confused asking my mom what’s she’s talking about. And my mom said, “I got up in the middle of the night and went to get water from the pitcher but it was empty. Then I heard footsteps coming up the stairs, but as they were getting closer to the top they just stopped.” And my grandma says, “That’s what I heard too.”
Then they both just stared at each other and left it at that.

Another story is my mom waking up in the middle of the night hearing her name being called over and over. She woke up and realized she was probably just dreaming, but the calling of her name continued and she realized it was coming from outside in the front courtyard. She thought it was the maid calling her with some emergency (the maid slept in the separate structure in the yard). She opened her window and said the voice just suddenly stopped. She said she said a prayer and kept her light on, eventually falling asleep. She asked me to sleep with her the following night and I’m like, “HELL NO.” 😂 I slept at my aunt’s house. Looking back I feel bad now.

Another story was my aunt and uncle coming home from dinner one night. There was a set of exterior stairs in the front courtyard that led straight to the second floor. They said they were walking in the courtyard and looked up seeing an old lady coming down the stairs. My uncle panicked thinking it was his mom, my grandma, coming down those big concrete stairs late and night and went to help her, when suddenly the image of the woman just slowly faded into thin air. He looked and yelled at my aunt, “Did you see that?!” to which she confirmed. They ran inside and told my grandma and my grandma said, “Yeah, it’s probably the lady who used to live here. I’ve never seen her though!”
It seems that my grandma who lived there alone for 40 years had less experiences than the rest of my family 😂",7,1761183251.0,Ghoststories,2,0.9,False

And of course I found law of assumption through law of attraction. It seems like I manifested so many things in my life like free coffee, concert tickets and classes getting cancelled. 

I have even manifested SP’s before. Last SP literally went from “not looking for anything bc I just got out of a toxic relationship” to “Idk what happened but I’m obsessed with you” but then that ended fast bc I had moved on and he wasn’t all that to begin with. Anyways, there’s this guy, same age, year, major the works. I have liked him on and off for 2 years and I didn’t really start consciously manifesting him and persisting in it until last semester (around February) Then March came around and this girl told me how he just sees me as a friend and how I should just move on. I was hurt, but didn’t let it show and kept persisting. The next day we were at my best guy friends st. Patty’s function and my SP was there. I obviously acted nonchalant, even tho my heart was pounding…and he actually spoke to me first…we were talking the whole time until 3am and then he walked my back to my on campus apt. The next morning found out he was interested. 

I should also say my self concept was shit. So once we were texting and FaceTiming and whatnot, I started having major doubts and was saying how things were too good to be true, how I’m going to be so heart broken when he leaves, what if this is all a joke, and on the 4th day of us talking he comes over and we cuddle while watching a movie the whole time then he says “I think we should just be friends, I was just testing the waters.” I was crushed and tried talking to him more and he said “I can’t force myself to like you” and that hurt even worse. I was devastated.

Anyways, summer came and went, focused on my Self concept to the point that I truly believe he would be lucky to call me his. Only thing is, I  don’t need him, but I still want him…I’ve done robotic affirming, but I can’t stop wavering bc this semester we are in every. Single. Class. Even rock, Latin and Jazz band which meets at night and on weekends…so I see him basically 24/7. I know manifestation is instant and I’m the one that’s keeping the resistance there, but does anyone have any tips that could help me get him back and stay, even tho the 3D is constantly in my face? He’s very hard to read and quiet…so yeah… I recently found out from his brother’s gf that his mom always brings me up and wants us to be together, so that’s a plus. I really would like to get him back before his birthday which is on Halloween (we’re both Scorpio’s 😭) please help 🙏",1,1761182456.0,manifestingSP,0,1.0,False

I will start with what I am looking for. I am single and I am trying to be plural, not single. Baaaaad pun.

I am rather left-leaning. I don’t want kids. I am atheist. Ok. So that should filter out a lot of people. 

I'm your stereotypical single, boring 40s male. I have a decent job and career, but my 3.0 GPA from a not-so-impressive university didn't exactly wow anyone. I've been on a career advancement journey, and it's wrapping up soon. I like my career and hope to use it for good. I love learning, so much so that I still take classes just for fun—community college programs, local weekly lessons, and weekend workshops. I'm particularly keen on improving my language skills. Yes, English is my first language,  I'm just that bad at it. I'm not joking.

I adore the arts and craftsmanship. I can spend a day in galleries and museums. Street performers and street artists make me happy. I'm a (bad) musician myself. I once asked a cobbler to show me his shop and tools. Like many millennial males, I've taken comedy classes. I have no shame in admitting that ""An Unusual Prince"" from Sleeping Beauty puts a stupid smile on my face. I read a lot of boring, technical non-fiction. No one's reading about command line syntax for escapism, right? I love to cook and bake and wish I had someone to do it with. I'm not above Taco Bell and Flaming Hot Cheetos, though.

I'm very left-leaning and care deeply about environmental issues. I can rant about infrastructure all day. I used to volunteer at a community center for marginalized groups and want to get into activism through research. I have the means to give my time to political causes and really should do so. I really want to do some guerrilla gardening in my city.

I work out and eat healthy regularly. I'm old, so I gotta keep the engine running. I love sports and was a former competitive athlete, though my record from my glory days definitely starts with a zero, so the number after the “/” doesn't matter. I recently got back into pro wrestling—it's a stupid good time, and I need that right now because the world has been a stupid bad time.

I'm under-traveled and want to change that this coming summer. I want to ride the train more, see more concerts, and be a bigger part of the local art scene. I plan to visit lots of thrift stores, used book stores, galleries, and coffee shops. I really should do the whole camper van road tripping thing. No, I don't want to go to a ton of microbreweries. I'm good on that; I'm already pretentious enough with the coffee.

More regular dreams though, and more nightmare type content. During the day, I have energy, and can kind of focus? But I'm smoking more nicotine and now drinking coffee occasionally again.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

I also like Asian women too please message me also! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!


Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

She would even hit me up at 6am or even 12am if it was a Friday. The second week when classes are back it’s a bit more distant but I manage to think of some interesting topics that got good energy. But after this last Saturday she sent two responses, I sent one back, she responds with how she deals with chilling after work and I gave one last response. But then nothing…. I sent just a a more chill if she had show recommendations…. Then nothing…. Two days go by and I thought well I should just ask her out maybe that would provide a response. So I asked her for coffee sometime since she wants to own a cafe. But even now there isn’t a single response. I don’t get how it ended up like this, we talked for hours on and off to just nothing.

Date two was dinner followed by a bar. She invited me home. I witheld sex from her bc of my own boundaries, but I stayed the night and we cuddled. We made a plan for a third date. 

At this point, I got severely anxious. She seemed very keen for a third date. I asked her to lmk what her schedule is looking like, knowing However, I noticed her pulling back. The first thing I remember doing was asking her if she wanted to communicate some different way- she never responded: that was my first red flag.

The second part was me saying that this dating part was very new to me, and I asked for help: again, didn’t get a response. 

However, she hit me with the “on Saturday I have x” with no alternative. I offered a walk for Wednesday, and she gave me another “I’m busy”

I’m freaking tf out at this point, so I first asked her “are you still interested”- realized that was an emotionally charged and overwhelming message, I ended up apologizing. I apologized for just being really a lot, and that I got really excited and anxious. 

She said that she was just really busy (and tbf I saw her schedule and she is rly busy, and I am too. I think I was upset she didn’t put an effort to put me into her schedule like I tried for her). 

Then, I sent a Hail Mary. 

“Sorry for yap chat 😭 🙏🏽 
I wanna say I’ve been pretty hurt and confused about the unclear communication. I don’t want to read hints (they’re dumb tbh) and I value honesty and clear and direct communication. If ur not interested, overwhelmed, confused, etc, id rather just know. I don’t want to like lecture you about this but I have to be real about where I’m at, and this is genuinely a topic I value and care about a lot

I’m still open to continuing bc I had a lot of fun with you, but I’d be happier if you could just tell me what’s up honestly”

Ik this is too much and that I’m too much. She never responded though….

Sent her a final message, which is just “I hope you’re ok” bc I think I just wanted to know that

Part of me is just like “why did I go so strong again”. Part of my is sad I gave too much power to her. Part of my is sad I told her all of this for nothing. 

Part of me is also hopeful she’ll come back. But ik she isn’t interested. But I also wonder I’ve given her every option to leave me, and tell me. But she didn’t take them. 

Ik im too much. I got excited. And it overwhelmed her. And my own anxiety issues flared up (which, tbh, is something I worked like hell on. A few years ago this was much worse)

Ik she’s trying to give me the hint she isn’t interested. 

But hints are- plainly- the absolute most stupid thing someone can use. I’m sorry. I hate hints in video games. I gave her the option to leave.

I know what happened on my end though.

I, too, was overwhelmed. I had never been over at a girls place. That was easily the best date I ever had. But, and this is new for me, I got so worried and excited I just got really really strongly emotional and pushed her away. I didn’t let myself marinate with the feelings, because I was worried she’d “forget about me”

Part of me wants to say “hey. I apologized before. I know why I acted the way I did. I’m sorry. Can we forget about the heavy stuff and just grab a coffee at some point?”. And part of me is like “you’ll push her away again ur too much clearly”. And part of me is like “don’t do anything she’ll come back.” And part of me is like “she couldn’t be honest with you. Yeah, you’re too much. But she couldn’t be honest”. And part of me is like “I pushed too much too soon because I’m dumb”

And idk

This is so new to me. This is stuff that middle schoolers and high schoolers go through. Not grown (ish) adults (im 22 in like a few hours). 

And I hope she understands that. 

And idk….i really don’t know",2,1761181596.0,ghosting,2,1.0,False

Back home, it happened all the time. Randomly complimented, conversations or flirting in coffee shops, while running errands/ working out etc. 

I know getting hit on doesn’t actually mean much, but it’s still been weird to see that shift and is beginning to make me feel a bit insecure. I take care of myself and have a pretty positive, outgoing vibe, so I’m also wondering if it’s more of a “Boston thing” or just dating culture changing in general. 

Curious if anyone else has noticed this after moving from elsewhere- or has been feeling the same way. Would love to know I’m not the only one in this boat. ",25,1761181536.0,BostonSocialClub,59,0.85,False

**Memory Transcript Subject: Sysil, Oddly Certain**

*Date \[Terran Standard Time\]: October 15th, 2136*



It's been a while since Veski marched up to his room.  I swear I heard something like crying a little after the door slammed?  

Obour told me not to worry about it but he's been more… What's a good word for it, stiff? 

He hadn't said a word all afternoon.  Which, I mean, isn't *that* unusual, but he at least acknowledges people when they pass him by.  Instead, he's just been going in circles cleaning, stocking, and locking up the store in complete silence.  The others are trying to help but Obour just shoos them away.  Jalsung eventually gave up on doing anything on the floor and came back around the counter to clean up the staff area and kitchen while I handled the ledger and credit accounting stuff.

Half a claw past closing and the store was just about ready to lock up.  All that was left was the stupid credit settlements and security checks.  All the extra software made this take twice as long as it usually would, mostly because someone at the bank had to physically check and confirm our sales for the day “because of increased risks”.

Jalsung took up a stool next to me and sat down, leaning her arms against the counter.  We sat in silence for way longer than I was comfortable with before Jalsung said in a low and tired voice,

“You know that things are gonna get bad here, right?”

Obviously.  I've been watching the news very closely.  So close in fact that I managed to find some nuggets of info that wasn't very public.  A string of posts from exterminators that got taken down almost as soon as they went up.  Threatening to ‘take care of Pinwood's mess’.  One guy, Qwin, went on a very long rant about how relieved they'll be to ‘finally burn that blood soaked nest’.

It scared me at the time, but I have heard just as much from people who aren't just neutral on the situation, but actually wanting to help!

My work for the store pages on Bleat and Flocker have gained a lot of unexpected traction.  My post this evening about “closing down tomorrow” had a ton of people voicing their support and a few outraged comments going crazy about how “horrible and unfair” this was.  I can't say for certain what will happen in the next couple days, but it's going to be crazy.  Maybe those people can be useful in some way?

Jalsung sighs.

Oh, I was supposed to respond.

“Uh.  Y-yeah.  I guessed so.”

“I can guess why Obour's all attached, but why are you still here?  You could just leave and hide out until things blow over.  Avoid all the *drama.*  We all could.”

It's surprisingly difficult to answer that question right away.  Not because I can't find any good reason, I just never needed to think that much about it.  I *want* to be here, at this store, around these people.

I think it's all because…

Liam is kind.

Kinder than anyone else I've met.  Maybe it's because predators don't fear like most people, so he wasn't scared of me.  At first I even thought that he would have wanted to have me take part in some crazy corpse eating ritual or something.  But no, he's just… nice.  No conditions or expectations.  He just *cares*.  I haven't been able to find people like that before.  And since I started working here I am constantly around people that are comfortable with me, that are kind and treat me like a normal person.  It's like this place is some sort of beacon for good.

“Uh… I just… don't want to?”

Jalsung huffs at me.

“Look man, this place isn't *safe.*  Not for you, Halsk, Nahlin, anyone.”

“I-I mean… not many places are safe for me.”

Woah, that was actually kinda snappy on my part!

“Sysil.  Seriously.  You do realise that the guild is going to march right into this place when that fleet reaches earth, right?”

“I mean, they *want* to.”

Jalsung's voice drops as she lifts her head from the counter.  Her tone turns ice-cold.

“They're going to.”

I try to sort out my thoughts for a moment, but the holopad dings at me.  I guess the bank finally responded.  This does provide a handy distraction for me, thankfully.  For whatever reason I just think better when my claws are busy.  Pick the pad up and start sorting out the last of the accounting and record keeping for the night while my mind wanders.

Am I actually worried about the exterminators?  And why does Jalsung seem so *certain* of how this is going to play out?

The second question I don't feel like I am able to answer, but I also can't imagine any scenario where she's not trying to help.  The first one is more difficult though.  

Because, I mean, obviously, right?  They terrify me.  My sleeping habits are terrible because I dream about them showing up some day and taking me back to the facilities, or just waking up in that cold cot again like none of this was ever real, speh, I even had dreams about them burning this place down before.  So it's not that I'm *not* scared.  

Maybe I just don't have anything else to hope for after this.  After all, if it's bad enough that the exterminators just obliterate this place at their first chance, then what happens after?  But that doesn't feel quite right.  I don't feel hopeless like I thought I would. Scared?  Yeah.  But there's something different there too.  This isn't just a need for survival.

I set the holopad down.

“I like it here.”

“I … I know.”  She says, voice wavering.

“And they aren't going to get rid of this place.”

Jalsung looks at me directly with so much pity.  Like she's doing everything in her power to keep from calling me a sad, dumb chick.

“Y-you know that there's protests already on Colia.”

Her voice was quiet.

“Quite a few from what I've heard.  Not that it's gonna matter in the long run.”  

“I don't know.  No matter what happens, things aren't going back to normal after this.”

“We can agree on that much.”

“One could happen here too.  It'd be pretty hard for the exterminators to do their ‘job’ while having to wade through an angry herd.”

Jalsung's head falls to the counter again.  She doesn't seem comforted by the idea somehow.  Obour passes by, returning the handheld vacuum and some rags to the kitchen.  Sysill reaches out and grabs his arm.

“Obour, help me talk some sense into Sysill.  We can't just stay here and wait for the worst to happen.”

Obour pauses, like it's taking him a moment to snap out of whatever headspace he was in.  He glances over his shoulder, but he still seems a little distracted.

“He was there for the Cradle.  I'll be here for Earth.”

Jalsung's grip loosens.

“And your girlie up there isn't leaving either.”

She groans and drops the paw.

“What is with all of you?!  We should be thinking about places we can run too, places to hide while the guild mobilizes!”

“Where too?  It's already not safe for Liam to be walking around town.”

“Anywhere!  Anywhere that isn't gonna be surrounded by flamethrowers!”

I mutter to myself, “There isn't any place like that.”

**Memory Transcript Subject: Liam, Doing Better**

*Date \[Terran Standard Time\]: October 15th, 2136*



I suck in a sharp breath of air and try to sit up.

Of course, I can't move at all.  My eyes aren't much help being all bleary.  Feeling around for a moment I steadily make sense of where I am.

I’m still in the apartment.  The room's cool, chilly even.  Despite that, I feel warm and cozy.  After some blind grabbing and patting, the massive teddy bear that's got me pinned to the sofa starts stirring as well.

“Mmmhh.”

“Ah.  Sorry Ves.”  I whisper.

She shifts around a bit, mostly just readjusting her arms to wrap tighter and pull herself closer.

“Mh.”

I just let it happen.  This closeness, this feeling of safety, it's too good to want to be free of it.  I'd have fallen back asleep if she wasn't smothering me.

After a few moments my phone's alarm starts going off.  It buzzes and rattles on the coffee table just out of arm's reach.  The alarm goes off a few times without any reaction from Veski, but the 4th causes her to get up.  Stubbornly, her lower half stays put on the sofa and she uses her upper arms to crawl out just far enough to grab it.  Quickly, her upper body crawls back.  She looks at the screen with an eye so tightly squinted I couldn't even tell that it was open.

“Hm.  What was this timer for?”

“30 past closing.  We should probably think about heading back down.”

“30 what?”

“Minutes.”

Ves blinks a few times, probably listening to her translator process and math out the difference in our time scales.  When it eventually clicks in her brain she flicks both her ears.

“Not as late as I thought.”

She then unceremoniously flops back on top of me with a soft thud, leaving my phone on the floor somewhere under the sofa.  I let out a tiny wheeze.

“We have a bit longer like this.”

“I guess so.”

My hands return to the top of her head and start working through her soft, thick fur.  My nails comb deep enough to gently scratch the skin.  Within seconds her whole body starts to relax again, practically melting into me.

“Where… did you learn this?”

I think for a moment, massaging my way up to her ears.

“Not sure if it's learned behavior or if it’s just baked into human nature, but I've always done it as far as I can remember.  My family had an old dog named Levi who loved it when I scratched behind his ears and right above the hips.  ‘Specially as he was getting older.”

“That is…”

She trails off.

At some point she readjusts herself to return the favor.  Shrugging off my arms and moving her own up and over to get to my head.  Her long claws gently trail through my scraggly, unkept hair.

It was bliss.

We just lay there for a while.  I'm not even sure for how long.  At some point I suddenly realized that I was nodding off again.

“Ves?”

“Yes?”

“We should probably get moving.”

“Hm.  I thought you liked this.”

I couldn't help but chuckle.

“I do.  I really do, but we have a bunch of friends down stairs that are expecting us.”

“Mh.”

I pat her sides.

“Ves?”

“Mh?”

She just keeps kneading my scalp as if it alone was gonna end the conversation.  The embarrassing part being that it was working.

Mercifully, she eventually stops and sits up.  She stares at me.  Her thoughts were impossible to read.  I was finally realising how much of a stone wall she was.

“Fine.  But on one condition.”

“Uh, what?”

“You make us some more of those predator meals.”

I laugh in earnest.  It was deep and right from the belly.  It felt good, really good.  Like I was finally shedding some nasty, invisible gloom that clung to my whole body.  I took a deep breath, pulling in what felt like the first lung-full of fresh, clean air in a while.

“It's a deal, you big goof.  Now come on, we got a game to get back to!”

**Memory Transcript Subject: Olivia, “Acting” Medic**

*Date \[Terran Standard Time\]: October 15th, 2136*



I was being surprisingly gentle considering the rush.  Still, the two casualties I dropped onto the stretchers wailed like I was actively mauling them.  This was my new normal in this psycho world.  All I could do was ignore it and move on to the next handful of people.

And it feels mean to even think it, but in a way I am thankful to for this.  I’m finally getting to do something, even if it feels small in the grand scheme of things.   Even though these battlefield (battlespace?) casualties are now plenty far away from the front lines I still get to feel like I am a part of it.  I won’t have to say that I was completely backseating the single most important years of human history anymore.

I was doing my best to help, genuinely.  But at a certain point I had to stop.  Not for exhaustion or the stress, if anything this was the most alive I’ve felt since we first discovered the that we weren’t alone in the universe!

I hobbled over to a corner, pulled my mask up just enough, and threw up whatever little food and water that was left in my stomach into a plastic bag I had kept in my pocket for just the occasion.  No amount of preparation saved me from the nasty, sickly feeling that came after.  The ensuing full body shudder just worked that nausea deeper into my bones.

The squeaking of an empty stretcher passes by, then stops.  A paw stroked my back.  At least, as far up as they could reach. 

""You have been pushing yourself very hard.  You can rest Olivia.  No one worth respecting will judge you.""

""I’m ok.  Honestly.  It’s just that fuckin smell.""

I can see out of the corner of my eye that Flynn is tilting his head.  He has that look that I am starting to learn as curiosity.

""What smell in particular?""

I wave my hand in the air in an “everything” gesture as I refit my mask.

""The chemicals remind me of operating rooms, and that metallic smell is outright horrid.""

His voice lilts upwards.

""Is it really that terrible?""

""Y-yeah.  Not many good memories from hospital visits.""

""Hm. Now that I think about it, quite a few of your family stories revolve around medical drama.""

He lingers, obviously trying to find the best way to ask about what’s actually piqued his interest.  Eventually he gives up on decorum.

""And the blood?""

""Dreadful.  Even the more familiar copper scent for human blood makes my nose burn, but this is a whole new level.  There’s something on top of the usual stinging, kinda like sulfur.  Smells like rot.""

I turn around and sit on one of the many seats that line the edges of the intake area.  Flynn and another medic flank the aforementioned stretcher, one looking way more stressed out than the other.

""Really?  That’s so strange.  I would-""

""I know.  I know.  Despite what you would think, blood is something we’re hard coded to be freaked out by.  Especially when that blood smells faintly of week old eggs.""

""But you have an affinity for tracking it?  That would imply…""

""That we’re really quick to notice that one of our own was hurt.  If they got stuck somewhere, hidden, lost, dragged away, we could find them and whatever did the damage.""

Flynn’s friend finally works up the courage to join in on the conversation.

""That still feels pretty… aggressive as a response to threats.""

""Bah, it’s really because we don’t have many other options.  Most animals evolved to be small and hard to get by climbing or digging or running fast, either that or they got too dangerous to mess with.  I mean, just look at all the other sapients out there.   Spikes, claws, wings, sprinters, camouflage, all sorts of crazy shit we don’t have!  Humans are just awkward primates that are too big to climb and too small to fight with raw muscle.

So, we got smart.  We got mean.  We made sure that anything that tried fuckin with our people only got the one lick.""

**Series of posts to WeFlock by HIGHDRIVE88**

*Date \[Terran Standard Time\]: October 14th, 2136*



**\[Video Begins\]**



The video opens to a blurry view of a wooden table, with the camera being so close that it's completely out of focus.

\[Laughter\]

“-way that we're doing this!”

“Oh come on, I went out of my way to get the spechin’ proof!  Are you gonna tell me this was for nothing?”

The camera is raised and refocused, revealing two adolescents, a zurulian and a venlil, excitedly arguing with each other.  The zurulian has their datapad out and is hurriedly tapping the screen.

“You didn't even go inside!”  The venlil shouts.

“Closer than you ever got!”

The zurulian eventually finds what they were looking for and turns their pad around to face the group.  The screen shows an obviously rushed photo looking into a store from the window.  A display shelf is at the center of the screen, on top of which is a boxed “miniature model set” of an emergency medical response shuttle.

“Look, look.”

They excitedly point to their pad.

“An HS-3028!  It's the exact same one my mom flew!”

The camera lowers slightly as a third voice joins the conversation.

“Yeah, like a billion brahking years ago.”

The zurulian puts their pad down on the table as they stick their tongue out at the camera.  The venlil leans forward over the table.

“Yeah yeah, Dackt's mom is an old fart but really, are we going in there or not?”

A faint hissing sound comes from behind the camera as someone sucks air through their teeth.  The zurulian looks pleadingly to the camera.

“Come on dude, please?  You know how bad I want this!”

“I can see from outside, you two ar-”

The venlil holds up three digits.

“Us THREE are gonna be just fine!  Because we're all gonna go in there together, grab the spehkin’ box, buy it, and get out before they get a whiff of us.  Yeah?”

“Yeah!  We're gonna be so quick!  In and out, that's it!”

The camera lowers even more.  The heads of the two kids are barely still in frame.

“Eehhh…”

The zurulian leans forward and whispers,

“Come with and I'll get you one of those Magic the Collecting b-”

The camera suddenly shoots upwards and turns to the side showing a busy street and several small, one to two story tall businesses.  All the kid's voices get distant as flapping and the clacking of talons on pavement obscures their voices.

“All you had to say hops!”

“Hey hey, hold on!”

\[Laughter\]

“You are all complete spehking *nerds.”*  


**\[End of video.  Next begins\]**  


The video opens with a view of the window, similar to the photo from before.  The wider angle allows for more to be visible however.  The camera-person is clearly wading through chest high bushes in order to get next to the large window.  Inside are a few customers milling about, wandering between shelves and observing the *many* miniatures, dioramas, and posters for popular human and federation media.

“See anything?”  The venlil's voice asks from behind the camera.

“Nothing yet.”  Says the camera-person.

“This is stupid.”  Mutters the zurulian, their voice sounding more distant than before.  “We're just drawing attention, snooping around like this.”

The camera tilts to the left.

“You wanna throw yourself right into the predator's jaws?”

“If the human was eating people this place would have been burned down already!”

The others make shushing sounds.

“Not so loud idiot!  Get over here before you get caught.”

The camera turns around to face the front door of the store, which is only a few paces away.  Stood just to the side of it is an anxious looking zurulian adolescent.

Just as the camera pans over, a bell over the door rings and a small group of people wander out, paws full of shopping bags and novelty items.  Several of them exchange awkward and confused glances with the kids.  The camera droops to look at the mulch covered garden bed and a pair of krakotl legs.

“Fine.  Whatever, let's get this over with.”



**\[End of video.  Next begins\]**



The camera is held low, peering around the corner of a shelf.  The video shakes as the camera-person struggles to hold steady.

“Is it out there?”  Whispers the venlil.  The camera-person takes a moment to gulp before responding.

“H-haven't seen anything yet.”

“Maybe th-

The zurulian mumbles a swear under their breath just before the sound of several cardboard boxes hitting the floor.  The camera whips around to see the venlil and zurulian with their paws on their heads looking at a pile of boxed model kits at their feet.

“Oh we gotta bail.”  Says the venlil

“Come on, we can g-”  The camera-person suddenly stops talking mid sentence.

The venlil's ears pin flat against their head as they point at something off screen.  The camera turns quickly and for a brief few frames, a gangly human with a mask covered in painted flowers can be seen peering around the corner.

“Can I-”

\[Shouting\]

The video becomes an unreadable, blurry mess as the pad is dropped.



**\[End of video.  Next begins\]**



“Are you for real?!”

Faint mechanical whirring and squawking of birds fill the background of the audio alongside the peaceful chatter of shoppers and art connoisseurs.  The zurulian and venlil cling to the edge of the storefront counter watching intently as a small 3D printer works on an unidentified project.  The human stood behind the counter, holding a large gray bird in his arms.

“Yeah, it's the least I could do after scaring ya'll so bad.”

The venlil laughs nervously.

“Well, we were snooping around…”

The human waves off the child's concerns.

“I get it.  Humans are new and scary.”

The zurulian says, “Y-you aren't *that* scar-”

The venlil jabs the zurulian in the ribs.

“*Dude!”*



**\[End of video\]**



\[Several photos are posted soon after depicting the group unboxing the aforementioned HS-3028 model, assembling it, and working together to paint it.

The final photo posted that night shows a poster for the ‘Exterminators’ most recent season where the main cast is posed with a caricature of a human looming over them.  The human and three children are standing under the poster, recreating the scene.\]

I posted a first draft of this a few weeks ago (linked below) and was so pleasantly surprised by the positive response I received—thank you! I took the feedback to heart and wanted to share an updated version. 


To highlight the changes: 

\- reorganized some of the stanzas to improve the flow

\- adjusted word choice to be more intentional and on theme (though this might have sacrificed some of the rawness that people liked in the first draft)

\- expanded a few ideas conceptually. 

Some people suggested toning down a few sections that overshadowed the others, but everything was so intentional,

so I added more instead. Now it’s a bit oversaturated, so I’m thinking of splitting up this entire piece and turning it into a series. So consider this as like a table of contents of sorts. 


Curious to hear your thoughts. I’m a total masochist so don’t hold back!
