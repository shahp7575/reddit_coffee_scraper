After a few months of daily collagen peptides (10g in my morning coffee), I noticed my joints clicking less, nails stopped breaking, and my skin elasticity felt different. The change wasn’t overnight, but slow and steady. My mom started it too and swears her knee pain eased up. It makes sense, collagen is literally the most abundant protein in the body, and we make less as we age. Tip: pair it with Vitamin C to boost absorption. I still roll my eyes at the “beauty powder” marketing, but this one is legit for connective tissue health.",1,1756972939.0,SupplementProof,0,1.0,False

I need to vent about the people I called ""Friends"" until recently.

I have 3 people who I'm close with (going to university and having spontaneous coffee afterwards and casual texting). When we run into each other because of work or unexpected everyting is fine but when it comes to planning ANYTHING it's a real pain in the a*s. 

My Birthday? Everyone knows when it is. Did I literally tell them since last birthday I'll have a big party this year? Yes. Did I ask them in advance on multiple occasions? Yes. Did anyone have time on the specific weekend as I told them my final plan? Nope.

A little summer party I wanted yo throw with coffee, cake and maybe a dinner. Did I ask everyone for a preferred date two weeks in advance? Yes. Did they all choose the same date? Yes. Did everyone cancel two days before the party? Yes.

Meeting up with one of those friends. Did SHE suggest we meet on suterday weeks ago? Yes. Did SHE remind me to be free on suterday because we'll meet? Yes. Did she tell me today she can't make it on suterday? Yes.

And the worst thing Is that they always want to reschedule........big Surprise: it still won't happen.

I hate it so much, I want to throw up whenerver one of them sends me a message.",1,1756972933.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

It's perfect for keeping your drinks cold or hot, whether you're hitting the trails or just chilling at home. The 32oz size is pretty generous, so you won’t be constantly refilling it, which is a huge plus when you’re out and about.

What I really like about this bottle is its double-wall vacuum insulation. It keeps your iced coffee cold for hours, and I’ve even used it for soup on a chilly day, and it stayed warm without a hitch. The twist cap is super convenient too. It’s easy to open and close, plus it prevents spills when you toss it in your bag. The stainless steel design is durable, and I’ve found it doesn't retain flavors, so my water always tastes fresh.

In terms of size and build quality, this bottle feels sturdy and well-made. It fits in most cup holders and is lightweight enough to carry around without any hassle. It’s great for anyone who needs a reliable water bottle that can handle a bit of adventure while keeping your drinks just the way you like them.",1,1756972709.0,u_Mantisirwin,0,1.0,False

1n842c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1n842c9/aith_for_avoiding_a_friend_deliberately_after_a/,AITH for avoiding a friend deliberately after a trip made me feel like shit around her,"Hi everyone. I’m a 26F who moved countries and eventually found a good enough group of people to hang out with. One of them is a 23F I met at a house party. I was in a phase of actively trying to make friends, so I was reaching out to people for one-on-one meetups. I asked her, she agreed, and she even followed up a week later. We ended up hanging out the entire day instead of just for coffee. I had a great time and found her to be quirky, lively, and sweet; she reminded me of a friend from back home.

As fellow expats, we bonded over our experiences. We spent a lot of time together, both in group settings with our mutual friends and just the two of us. For a year, things were great, and I was genuinely happy to have found a good friend.

Then, this summer, we decided to go on a girls trip with four of us. That's when the glass shattered for me, and I don’t know if I'm overthinking it, if I should talk to her, or just let it go.

Here’s what happened on the four-day trip:

Unequal Treatment: I noticed she acted completely differently around our mutual friend, A. Every joke A made was hilarious, but every joke I made was ""offensive,"" ""cancelable,"" or worse. There were instances where A made the exact same joke the next day, and she found it hilarious.
Dismissiveness and Condescension: She would roll her eyes and correct me over mundane things. For example, I suggested taking the LRT to a restaurant, and she rolled her eyes saying, ""Why the fuck would we do that when we can just call a cab?""
Disrespect for My Belongings: I mentioned my beach sandals were from the dollar store just for the trip. The next day, she asked to wear them. When I asked what I would wear, her excuse was that since I don't swim, I shouldn't care, but since they looked nice with her dress, I should let her wear them. I reluctantly agreed, planning to wear sneakers. When the sandals didn't fit her, I warned her they would hurt her feet and get bent out of shape. She replied, ""I'll give you the four dollars you spent on these.""
Backhanded Comments: She wanted to wear my white T-shirt, and I said sure. She wore it backwards to make it look good, asked where I got it, and when I said a wholesale store, she replied, ""Oh, that's why it's itchy."" (The tag would itch anyone wearing a shirt the wrong way, but okay.)
""Dibs"" Don't Apply to Me: She called dibs on everything, and her dibs were respected. If I called dibs on anything, it meant nothing. Our other friend, B, noticed this and even called her out on it.
One-Upping and Questionable Ailments: It sounds bitchy, but she seems to have every mental and physical health problem anyone else mentions. When A asked how I was dealing with my PCOS (a lifelong, manageable condition), she said, ""Oh, I had that too, but I fixed it."" When another friend mentioned being on disability after an accident, 23F suddenly had also been on disability. She claims to have BPD, ADHD, PCOS (which she ""fixed""), and a sunlight allergy—though she had no problem at the beach. The allergy only became a problem when I bought the last sun hat, which she then asked me to give her because of her condition. I could go on.
Other Dynamics I Noticed:

Friend A enabled her behavior and then acted innocent.
Friend B was visibly annoyed with her and later confessed to me that she had noticed this pattern on a previous trip with this girl as well.
At the airport at the end of the trip, 23F said to me, ""I'm sorry I was a bitch on the trip; I was just overstimulated.""
I just said, ""It happens,"" and went home.

I have been avoiding her for two months, making up excuses to not hang out as a group if I know she’ll be there, or just no to 1-1 hangouts saying I’m busy with chores. Now her birthday is coming up, and I don't want to be a fake friend who shows up but doesn't really care.

Should I let her know how I feel? Should I just part ways? I’ve thought about talking to her about her behavior, but she gave me a vibe that she would smear my name.

The only positive thing from this trip is that B and I became much closer friends.

AITA for feeling this way? Should I address it or just let it go?",5,1756972560.0,AITH,3,1.0,False

His head thrown back, hand in her hair. ""Dirty bimbo,"" he grunted.

His eyes met mine when he heard my horrified gasp.

""Becca..."" he choked out and the redhead pulled her mouth off of my husband with a little pop. She turned her head and licked her lips before smirking at me.

""You son of a bimbo"" I snarled.

""Becca, give me a chance to explain."" He reached for me with tears in his eyes.

""Don't touch me.Don't bother coming home"" I ignored him and ran outside.

""Just let her go Jake."" The bimbo Jessica laughed, ""You can stay at my place, won't be the first time.""

Becca

A few days prior

""Hey Jake, are you almost home?"" I asked and propped the phone between my shoulder and ear so I could adjust our son on my hip.

""Sorry babe, I'm going to be late tonight. The client asked if we would take them out to dinner"" my husband replied.

""Oh,"" I tried to keep the disappointment out of my voice but failed ""All alright, I'll just put your plate in the fridge. How late do you think dinner will go?""

""I don't know, Becca"" he paused as a voice murmured in the background and then continued ""I'll be right there. Hey Becca, I've gotta go, they're waiting on me. Don't wait up, you and the baby need your rest.""

""Okay..."" he hung up before I could finish my sentence.

""Looks like it's just you and me tonight, T."" I said and bounced my 3-year-old son Tony a couple times. ""And sissy"" I added as his little sister kicked my bladder.

I rubbed my stomach absentmindedly and looked around the kitchen. Today had been the gender scan and I hadn't told Jake. I knew my husband wouldn't be able to get the time off of work because an important client was in town this week and he had been so stressed about how much of his time they were demanding. Not wanting to add to his stress, I had gone alone and planned on surprising him tonight with the news that we were having a little girl. I had baked a small cake for us and filled the inside with pink frosting and was going to present him with the cake and a picture of the scan right after dinner. As a partner at a prestigious law firm, it was not abnormal for Jake to have last-minute meetings. At 33, Jake was the youngest partner and because of that he said he had to work harder than everyone else.

I put away the lasagna, and cake, and took Tony upstairs for his bath.

We lived in a very comfortable 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath, 2 story house in a safe neighborhood outside of Boston. We had moved here 5 years ago right after we got married, and within a year we found out we were expecting Tony. I had spent my 21st birthday puking just like everyone else, only mine was morning sickness not a hangover.

After I had bathed Tony, I read him a bedtime story and tucked him in for the night. It was only 7p.m, so I still had plenty of time to tidy up and read a few chapters before heading to bed myself. I cleaned up the kitchen and stuck the scan back in my purse and then headed upstairs with my kindle.

I felt the bed dip and heard my husband chuckle as he slid into bed next to me.

""Fell asleep reading again?"" He asked quietly as he took my kindle off of my chest and set it on my bedside table.

""Guess so"" I murmured ""What time is it?""

""It's a little after 9"" He replied and gave me a peck.

""How did it go?"" I asked between pecks.

""Fine, same as always they just need to feel like they're the most important thing in our world."" He smiled at me as I tried to blink away sleep. His hair was wet, and he looked tired.

""They're working you too hard."" I grumbled and snuggled into his chest as he laid back in bed.

""It won't always be like this."" He replied and then asked, ""How was Tony today?""

""He was good, he had morning preschool and then went to the store with me this afternoon.""

Jake pecked the top of my head and turned off the light.

The next morning, we both woke at the same time and began our usual morning routines. I grabbed Tony out of the crib, while Jake made coffee and then I made breakfast while he took a shower and got ready for work. There wasn't time to discuss the scan, but I asked if he could please try to be home for dinner tonight. He said he would do his best and gave us both a peck before rushing out the door.

As I got Tony ready for school, I realized I really didn't want to wait to share the news with my husband until his work schedule allowed it. I was rarely difficult about his work schedule, but it was upsetting to face these milestones alone. I decided I would drop Tony off at school and then surprise Jake at work with the cake and scan.

After I dropped Tony off, I called for a cab to pick me up at the house; finding parking in the city was a nightmare and I didn't have a parking pass for the firm's garage. It didn't take long to get there. I thanked the driver as I slid out of the car with my cake in hand.

The guard in the lobby recognized me and waved me through with a smile. It had been a few months since I had last visited but before this pregnancy, I use to stop by for lunch with Jake at least once a week.

I bumped into one of his coworkers and friend, Ryan, on my way to Jake's office.

""Becca?"" he called out with a smile ""What are you doing here?""

""I have a surprise for Jake"" I smiled and lifted the cake box up.

""Lucky prick!"" he joked.

""I'll tell him to save you a piece"" I replied and continued down the hall.

Maryanne, Jake's secretary, was sitting at her desk and gave me a bright smile when I approached.

""Good morning Mrs. Manning, I didn't know you were coming in this morning.""

""Good morning, Maryanne, it's a surprise. Is he busy?'

""He just finished with his first client and shouldn't have another call for thirty minutes."" She replied checking his schedule. ""Go right in!""

I gave a quick knock before opening the door. Jake was sitting at his desk staring at his computer screen. He had a very serious expression on his handsome face and his hair was slightly messed up, as if he had recently run his hands through it. He looked up at the intrusion, with an annoyed expression but it quickly fell away into a smile when he saw it was me.

""Becca, what are you doing here?"" He asked and stood up to greet me. At 6'1 he towered over my much smaller 5'5 frame.

""I couldn't wait until tonight to show you this."" I said and set the cake down on his desk and then stood on my tippy toes to give him a peck.

""You brought me a cake?"" He asked and lifted an eyebrow.

""Actually, I baked you-us a cake last night.""

His face dropped a little.

""I'm sorry about dinner"" He started to say.

""Jake, I've never come to the office to lecture you and that's not why I'm here today"" I interrupted with my hand up. He nodded and waited for me to continue ""I had a doctor's appointment yesterday, and I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't be able to get the time off and then would just beat yourself up for it after.""

""Is everything okay with you and the baby?' He asked, looking alarmed.

""Of course, it was the 20-week scan."" I smiled and pulled the scan out of my purse ""I got to see our baby yesterday.""

""Oh, I wish I had been there... 20 weeks is the gender scan, isn't it?"" he asked as the news dawned on him ""So, you know what we are having?""

""Yep!""

""Are you going to tell me?"" He asked with a grin.

""Nope.""

""Becca...""

""But the cake will!"" I said with a giggle.

Jake laughed and pulled me into a hug.

""I love you Rebecca Manning"" he said.

""You better, Jacob Manning"" I teased.

A few minutes later we were hugging again, and Jake was loudly announcing to his office that he was going to be a girl dad. The office replied with mixed calls of congratulations, and Ryan called out that if our daughter looked anything like her mother Jake should get a lawyer on retainer now, and then told him he know a guy. Which made the entire office laugh.

As soon as we were alone in his office again, he pushed me up against the door and gave me a panty soaking peck.

""Have I thanked you lately for making me the happiest man in the world, Rebecca"" he growled against my lips between pecks.

""Not in the last 48 hours"" I replied, breathlessly, as he nipped at my ear.

""I should rectify that immediately.""

""Maybe you should"" I moaned as his lips trailed down my neck and his teeth grazed my skin.

His phone ringing halted our almost office intercourse and he pushed away from me with a groan.

""I'm so sorry babe, this is my next appointment, I have to take this call"" he sat down and ran his hands through his hair looking frustrated.

""It's okay Jake, I'm the one who barged in."" I giggled ""but I will expect you to finish what you started tonight.""

""You can count on it."" He growled and his eyes darkened with his promise.

I blew him a peck as he picked up the phone and stepped out of his office with a smile.

""Have a good afternoon, Maryanne.""

""You too, Mrs. Manning!"" She replied.

I was stopped a few more times on my way to elevator by people I knew from various office parties and by one of the other partners. They all wanted to congratulate me and ask about the pregnancy and tell me how much Jake brags about his family. Finally, after twenty minutes of small talk I made it down to the lobby where the guard asked me if I needed him to call a car for me.

""No, that's okay I can just use the app."" I replied and reached for my purse. I cursed quietly when I realized I had left it in Jake's office. ""Well, I can use the app after I go back upstairs and get my purse."" I said and laughed ""pregnancy brain is a real thing, Jerry.""

""Oh, I know"" he replied, ""by the time our 4th was coming I was worried Gloria might leave a baby somewhere."" He chuckled.

I laughed and got back on the elevator.

Maryanne wasn't at her desk when I got back to Jake's office. I hesitated at the door for a moment but decided that it would be less distracting for me to just slip in grab the purse and blow a peck than to knock.

As the door was opening, I heard Maryanne call to me from down the hall

""Wait!""

I didn't need to worry about distracting Jake as it turned out, because he was plenty distracted by the pretty redhead that was on her knees with her lips wrapped around my husband's shaft while he reclined in his chair.

His head was thrown back in pleasure and he had one hand wrapped in her hair as he pushed her head up and down rapidly.

""Dirty bimbo"" he grunted, and she moaned.

His eyes met mine when he heard my horrified gasp.

""Becca..."" he choked out and the redhead pulled her mouth off of my husband with a little pop. She turned her head and licked her lips before smirking at me.

""You son of a bimbo"" I snarled and stormed forward to grab my purse that was still sitting on his desk next to the cake box.

He jumped to his feet and tucked himself back into his pants while trying to form a sentence.

""Wait, let me... I know- it's not"" he reached for my arm.

""Don't touch me.""

""Jake..."" the redhead said as she got to her feet.

""Not now, Jessica"" he snapped.

""Excuse me?"" She huffed.

""Shut up"" I snarled at her and turned back to Jake ""Don't bother coming home.""

""Becca, give me a chance to explain."" He reached for me again with tears in his eyes.

""Just let her go Jake."" Jessica laughed, ""You can stay at my place, won't be the first time.""

""bimbo..."" I spun to face her.

""Jessica, shut the mess up."" Jake snarled.

""Have you no shame? I'm pregnant with his second child and you are gloating about being the side chick?"" I scoffed.

""I'm not the side chick."" She huffed, indignantly and cross her arms under her very enhanced chest ""he just can't leave your fat hip because you got knocked up.""

""That's okay, he's all yours. My 'fat hip' and I wish you both all the best."" I side-stepped his hand and stormed out of his office.

""Have you lost your mind?"" I heard him roar as I slammed the door behind me.

The next few moments were a blur as I somehow managed to get to the elevator without letting anyone stop me. I wasn't sure if Jake was going to chase after me or not and didn't slow down for even a second to find out. In the lobby Jerry tried calling out to me that Mr. Manning had asked me to wait but I ignored him and ran outside.

1n83zys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n83zys/aita_for_being_resentful_that_my_younger/,"AITA for being resentful that my younger, inexperienced colleague got promoted to manager while the rest of us keep being told we are “not ready”?","I (25M, Alex) have been at my small town company for almost 5 years. Recently, my younger colleague Karl (24M) was promoted to manager of his team after the previous manager left. Karl has only been here for a little over 2 and a half years, and the first 2 years were him rotating through different teams as part of the graduate programme. Realistically, he has only been in his current team full-time for about a year.

When the promotion was announced, a lot of us were shocked. Almost everyone on that team are senior with years of experience, while Karl is still relatively new. No people leadership experience, barely any time in the role, yet now he is managing people who have been here much longer and are more skilled.

To be fair, Karl does get involved and has done some good work. But most of the time, it is heavily supported by others. He rarely acknowledges the people who back him up, and instead it is usually the people he “helps” who thank him because they are kind enough to give credit. It feels one-sided.

What makes this harder to swallow is how inconsistent things are. I have seen really talented engineers denied senior promotions because they were told they need to be “more technical” or they have not “been in the role for at least 5 years.” Yet Karl, who has barely been in the team a year, gets handed a manager role. To a lot of us, it just looks like favoritism.

Then there is his behavior. He claims he is always “so busy doing everyone’s work,” but half the time we see him in the kitchen or outside having coffee. People call him the “teacher’s pet” because he signs himself up for internal working groups, but then he takes the credit without putting in much of the actual effort. He also has a habit of talking down to people, and there have already been complaints to HR.

Some people in the office even avoid working with him. Whenever he is involved, it tends to become a fake “democracy.” He will claim leadership without asking anyone, then start delegating while mostly “checking in” and “reporting back.” On one project, someone pointed out that his name was not under any of the team tasks. His response was, “Well, someone needs to make sure everyone’s on the right track.” That rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.

At the same time, I cannot help but think there might also be a financial angle. Hiring or promoting someone with more experience would probably mean paying them more, while Karl is still relatively junior. It would not surprise me if management saw him as a cheaper option, even if he is not the most qualified.

I know part of this is on the system itself. The process is clearly flawed, and a lot of us are frustrated and confused about how this even happened. At the same time, it does feel disheartening and disappointing that Karl chose to accept and step into this role knowing full well there are others who are more experienced, more deserving, and have been waiting years for the chance.

So here is where I am stuck:

AITA for feeling resentful about this promotion?

Am I being too harsh on Karl, or is it fair to expect him to recognize that he is not ready and step aside?

Or is it the system that failed everyone here, and my frustration should really be directed at management instead of him?

And is it reasonable to think this decision was also about saving money rather than actually choosing the best person?",0,1756972287.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.I was so hopelessly dumb.A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]\*\*\*\*\*Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence...............................................................................""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.\*\*\*\*\*I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.\*\*\*\*\*Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.""It went viral in my neighborhood—everyone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""\*\*\*\*\*A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?""No, thanks,"" I replied.His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.""I mean, we're done,"" I said.Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""..............................................................................After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while—he'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""So that was why he dressed up—he thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.""I don't need that—"" I tried to shoot back.Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""My resolve started to waver, but not because of him—it was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.Just as I was about to crack, something unexpected happened that helped me decide what to do...............................................................................At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, and I was taken aback to see Rosemary standing right in front of me.She looked drained and pale, wearing a white dress that did nothing to hide her distress.""Laurel, are you mad at Austin?"" Rosemary's eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and there was a mix of fear and helplessness in her expression.She continued, her voice cracking, ""It's all my fault. I didn't clarify things with Austin, and that's what led to the misunderstanding between you two.""I remained silent, my gaze fixed on Rosemary.""Please, don't be angry with him. I'm truly sorry,"" she pleaded, clearly overwhelmed. ""Austin has been planning for ages to get a marriage license with you."" She bit her lip, looking extremely weak.I was about to reply when Austin, whose face was dark with frustration, said, ""Laurel, enough already. Rosemary came here to apologize—what more do you want from her?""I noticed the bruise on her wrist, wrapped in cloth, and shifted my attention to Austin, ""Austin, how about you make a choice? You can either have me or Rosemary.""""That's enough, Laurel!"" he snapped, glaring at me as though he could burn a hole right through me.The answer had been clear for a while, but here I was, still holding on. Not for him, but for myself. Six years. How did I lose myself in all this and end up loving a guy like him? I had no idea.I looked at Austin, trying to keep my cool, and gave a faint smile. ""So, if I go celebrate another guy's birthday, hang around when he's sick, and baby him every now and then, does that make me just some shameless woman in your eyes?""""Laurel, Austin and I are not what you think,"" Rosemary mumbled, her surprise evident.""Come on, Rosemary. You know Austin and I are getting married, so why do you keep showing up looking all innocent? You're playing the role of the 'good girl' pretty well,"" I shot back.With those words, Rosemary froze, disbelief written all over her face, and then she burst into tears.Pop! Austin's brow furrowed in anger as he stared at me, who had been slapped to the ground by him.""Laurel,"" Rosemary's reaction was immediate as she rushed to help me.But I caught a glimpse of a smirk creeping onto her lips just before she lowered her gaze. It was quick but telling."" off!"" The words flew out before I could stop myself, and Rosemary stumbled back a couple of steps.""Laurel,"" Austin said, his eyes heavy with disappointment. ""You've turned into a green-eyed monster. Rosemary was just trying to help you, and you went and pushed her away?""Rosemary started tugging on his arm, stammering, ""Austin, I'm fine. It's my fault. I made Laurel mad.""I finally managed to stand and let out a soft laugh. ""What a twist! Did I even touch you, Rosemary? No matter what happens, suddenly it's my fault? Am I like some kind of biochemical weapon just for you?""Rosemary looked stunned, lost for words, but then tears started streaming down her face as if they were on a mission.""Laurel, I want you to apologize to Rosemary! Or else I'm not getting married,"" Austin demanded, furrowing his brow. He seemed totally unfazed by the breakup talk.Sure, I usually brought up breakups during our fights, but in the end, all it took was a little coaxing from him, and I'd be back on his side, pretending nothing had ever gone wrong.I didn't want to dwell on these arguments to protect our feelings.But suddenly it hit me: what Austin and I had was just me fooling myself, constantly backing down and giving in.""Austin, we're done. I'm the one who called it off. You both handle it from here,"" I said, wanting nothing more than to walk away from the mess and that scum for good.With that, I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door, not looking back. Rosemary was still trying to reason with Austin. ""Austin, you should go after Laurel. This is all my fault,"" she pleaded.""Relax, she's just having a little meltdown. She won't really break up with me,"" Austin assured her.Once I settled into the cab, I noticed the two of them on the security camera, wrapped up in each other's arms, and I couldn't help but smirk a little. They claimed there was nothing between them, but deep down, I knew the truth.I raised a hand to my cheek, still tender from Austin's earlier blow, and it felt like a knife twisted in my heart. The ache spread through my body, a reminder of the six years I'd wasted.I wasn't crying, but my heart felt so heavy it was hard to breathe.After a moment of reflection, I pulled up the video I had just recorded and posted it on my Instagram.Since I decided to cut ties with Austin, I figured it was only fitting to finish what they started. I wasn't going to take this slap for nothing.I crafted my last message: \[A shoutout to those who'd supported me over the past six years. I am officially breaking up with Austin.\]With a final click, I powered off my phone. Clutching an ice pack over my throbbing head, I glanced at the city disappearing beneath me.There was a mix of humiliation and anger in my heart, but seeing the bright blue sky somehow lightened the burden a bit.Before I knew it, I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with tears streaming down my face. Just then, a long, elegant hand offered me a gray handkerchief.""Here,"" the owner of the pretty hand said, his voice smooth and calming.""Thanks,"" I mumbled, taking it awkwardly.""Are you alright?"" he asked, a note of concern in his tone.I nodded, forcing a bittersweet smile. ""I'm fine, just a bad dream.""I dreamt back to the first time I laid eyes on Austin, my heart racing—it was definitely one of those love-at-first-sight moments.Later on, I even went so far as to lower my standards just to get into the same school as him. I thought it would lead to a better life, but honestly, I was just squandering my best years.It was interesting how sometimes the wrong person could feel scarier than facing a real demon.I let out a deep sigh and turned to glance at the guy sitting next to me. Just one look, and my whole body froze.My heart raced as I managed to stammer, ""Un-uncle Alex, what are you doing here?""Alex Herrera raised an eyebrow, sizing me up before casually saying, ""Didn't you break up with Austin? Why do you still call me uncle?""..............................................................................I took a deep breath when I unexpectedly ran into Alex on the plane. How did I end up meeting him here? He was Austin's uncle and Raphael Herrera's youngest son.In the Herrera family, he was the one everyone feared—especially Austin.Growing up, Alex was molded to be someone else entirely. When I first heard his name, I pictured a woman, but instead, I found this incredibly handsome guy—more stunning than most women I know.Not only did he have looks, but he had also got this air of sophistication about him. At a young age, he was already seated as the president of Herrera Group.Though he was only six years older than Austin, Austin had to call him uncle, and I was dating Austin, so I'd been doing the same.But now that Austin and I were officially done, it felt silly to still call him that.""Did you and Austin have a fallout?"" Alex asked, his voice lowered as he crossed his legs, a knowing smile on his face.""No, it's a breakup,"" I said, trying to sound confident.""A breakup?"" He looked surprised, still smiling, but I could tell he didn't buy it.I mean, who could blame him? Being married to Austin, a rich young man from the Herrera family, seemed like a dream for most women.Besides, after six years together, how could I possibly just walk away from that? Back then, I was all-in on Austin.Everyone thought I was just lucky to be with him, and honestly, if he'd revealed his true identity back in school, I might not have been his pick in the first place.Now, I was nearing thirty with nothing to show for it—who was I to break up with him? Even Austin assumed I was head over heels for him and that suggesting a breakup was just me throwing a fit.""Yeah,"" I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself, trying my best to keep it cool.""I saw your Instagram."" Alex looked up slowly, his voice still calm and soft.It felt like the way an elder talked to a younger person, but the light in his eyes—slightly reminiscent of Austin's—hit me with a mix of panic and awe.I honestly hadn't expected Alex to keep tabs on my Instagram, and I'd even forgotten he had an account. He rarely said much online, just a few holiday photos now and then. I seriously wondered if he even used it himself.""As long as you've thought it through,"" he added.I was taken aback for a second, waiting for Alex to drop some words of shame or caution about being impulsive. Instead, he surprised me with his response.The tension in my chest vanished instantly as I managed a shy smile and nodded silently.I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the plane touched down and I watched Alex stand up and grab his luggage.Although he wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, he still had this unshakeable aura that felt heavy.As I stepped out of the airport, a black Alphard suddenly pulled up right in front of me.Before I could process it, the driver came over and said, ""Ms. Parks, Mr. Herrera asked me to give you a ride.""I opened my mouth to decline, but when the window rolled down and I saw that gorgeous face, words just vanished.At that moment, it hit me—Austin's fear of Alex was totally justified. The guy had such a strong presence that I felt too timid to say no.""Get in the car. It's going to rain soon,"" Alex said, glancing at me with that cool gaze.I found myself sliding into the car without a second thought. Sitting beside him, I quickly masked my emotions. My face was calm, but inside, I felt this strange unease.After all, I had just broken up with Austin. Why would Alex bother giving me a ride? Was it just because of the rain? Or maybe he felt sorry for me?Trying to figure it out was a lost cause, especially since Alex and I had only crossed paths a few times.It was not like a guy like him would focus on someone like me. Maybe it was just pity, some kindness for someone who had just got out of a serious relationship. Honestly, I decided not to overthink it.""Where to?"" Alex's calm voice pulled me out of my thoughts.""The hospital,"" I replied almost automatically, without thinking twice.Honestly, I felt a bit awkward saying that, but I was already thankful that I kept my home address under wraps.All of a sudden, it started pouring rain. It didn't even register with me that it was actually raining.Half an hour later, we pulled up outside the hospital. The driver got out, grabbed my luggage from the trunk, and strolled over with an umbrella in hand.As I stepped out, I glanced back at Alex, who was sitting in the car with his eyes half-closed. I swallowed my thanks and left.Taking my suitcase and turning my back to the sleek black car, I finally let out a long sigh of relief.In my mind, I couldn't shake the image of Alex's striking profile. He was clearly in his early thirties but carried an air of maturity that made him seem older.It was a shame, too, because, with a face like that, Alex would probably attract a lot of young admirers.As I walked into the hospital and fished out my phone, a call came in from an unknown number. After a brief moment of hesitation, I hit the answer button.""Laurel, what the heck is wrong with you? Do you even realize that Rosemary is sick because of you?"" It was Amanda Herrera, Austin's mother, and her angry voice echoed through the line.I stood there for a second, stunned, gripping my suitcase tightly.""Laurel, you need to come back right now and apologize to Rosemary. Clear things up online and say you posted that video by accident. We'll let this slide!"" Amanda demanded.I instinctively ran my fingers over my throat, which still felt a bit sore.I was relieved that I hadn't gone through with getting a license with Austin.Honestly, I was grateful for the last three years of not marrying him. It took me a while to truly see how ridiculous I was being.Looking back on the past six years, it felt like I'd thrown a piece of my heart to the wolves.I looked at her and said, ""Mrs. Herrera, Austin and I are through. So, do me a favor and don't bother me again.""""Laurel, enough already! You're really crossing the line here. My mom called you—so what the hell do you want from me?"" Austin's voice came through, sharp and frustrated.",1,1756972264.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

Looking for tips on healing, budgeting, and exploring","Napadpad ako dito sa Laguna dahil sa kaka-*soul searching* na yan. 😅 I’m not originally from Luzon, so everything feels both exciting and unfamiliar. This is my first time really living on my own, and while it’s a little intimidating, I also feel like it’s the right step for me.

I’m hoping to use this season of solo living to actually *heal.* To slow down, reflect, and reconnect with myself. I like hiking and being surrounded by nature, watching movies (whether in theaters or just solo nights in), and going out by myself to explore new spots like coffee shops or quiet places where I can just think.

The challenge is, I also want to stay practical. Kelangan mag*tipid* while still being able to do the things that make me feel alive and help me heal. It’s a balancing act: giving myself experiences without draining my wallet.

So, I’d really love to hear advice from anyone who:

* **Lives (or has lived) in Laguna** → Any local hikes, nature spots, or underrated places that are either cheap or free but worth checking out?
* **Has experienced solo living** → How do you budget in a way that doesn’t make life feel like pure survival, but still leaves space for joy?
* **Has gone through a healing phase while living alone** → What helped you most? Were there routines, small habits, or mindsets that kept you grounded?

I’m looking for more than just a “where to eat” or “how to save” list. I’d love both the practical tips *and* the little lessons you’ve learned along the way.

Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their stories. Hopefully, I’ll get to build a little rhythm here in Laguna that’s both affordable and soul-nourishing. ",0,1756971864.0,SoloLivingPH,0,0.5,False

1n83uui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1n83uui/the_100point_divorce_plan/,The 100-Point Divorce Plan,"For three years, I documented the slow death of my marriage in a black journal. It was my 100-point divorce plan: for every time my husband, Blake, chose his first love, Ariana, over me, I deducted points. When the score hit zero, I would leave.  
  
The final points vanished the night he left me bleeding out from a car crash. I was eight weeks pr\*\*nant with the child we had prayed for.  
  
In the ER, the nurses frantically called him-the star surgeon of the very hospital I was dying in.  
  
""Dr. Santos, we have a Jane Doe, O-negative, bleeding out. She's pr\*\*nant, and we're about to lose them both. We need you to authorize an emergency bl\*\*d transfer.""  
  
His voice came over the speaker, cold and impatient.  
  
""I can't. My priority is Miss Whitfield. Do what you can for the patient, but I can't divert anything right now.""  
He hung up. He condemned his own child to death to ensure his ex-girlfriend had resources on standby after a minor procedure.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Blake Santos never expected to find the notebook.   
  
He was searching for his favorite platinum cufflinks, a gift from his father, in the back of the shared closet. His fingers brushed against a leather-bound journal tucked away in a shoebox, hidden behind Caroline's winter boots. It wasn't hers; her journals were always brightly colored, filled with architectural sketches. This one was plain black. Curiosity, a rare emotion for him, took hold. He opened it.  
  
The first page was titled in Caroline's neat, precise handwriting: The 100-Point Divorce Plan.  
  
Blake frowned. He read the rules written below.  
  
Starting Points: 100.  
  
For every action that proves this marriage is a mistake, points will be deducted.  
  
When the score reaches zero, I will file for divorce. No exceptions.  
  
He let out a short, humorless laugh. A game. It had to be some silly game his wife was playing. He flipped through the pages. Each entry was dated, a meticulous log of his supposed transgressions.  
  
\-1 Point: He forgot our anniversary. Again. He was having dinner with Ariana.  
  
\-2 Points: He canceled our vacation because Ariana's dog was sick. He spent the weekend at her apartment.  
  
\-1 Point: He called me Ariana by mistake.  
  
\-3 Points: He bought the last bottle of a vintage w\*\*e I'd been searching for, only to give it to Ariana for her birthday.  
  
The list went on, page after page. A detailed, painful chronicle of his neglect. Blake felt a flicker of annoyance, not guilt. He saw it not as a record of his failures, but as a testament to Caroline's obsession with his friendship with Ariana Whitfield. Ariana was his first love, the one who had shattered him when she left years ago.   
  
Caroline knew that. He had married Caroline on the rebound, a convenient, stable choice from a good family, a person who could manage the Santos household while he focused on his career and, if he was honest, nursed his broken heart.  
  
He shut the notebook, his annoyance hardening into cold indifference. He tossed it back into the box. A ridiculous, childish list. It meant nothing. He found his cufflinks and shut the closet door, the notebook already fading from his mind. He had more important things to think about. He had a custom-made necklace for Ariana in his briefcase. Her art gallery was having its grand opening, and he needed to be there.  
  
He walked into the living room. Caroline was on the couch, sketching on a large pad, her brow furrowed in concentration. She looked up when he entered, a hopeful light in her eyes that he had long ago stopped noticing.  
  
""You're home early,""  she said, her voice soft.  
  
""I have to go out again soon,""  he replied, loosening his tie. ""Ariana's gallery opening.""   
  
The light in her eyes dimmed. ""Oh. Right.""   
  
He saw the notebook on the coffee table, a different one, one of her sketchbooks. He glanced at an open page. It was a drawing of a nursery, detailed and full of soft light. A crib, a mobile with tiny stars, a rocking chair. He felt a strange pang in his ch\*\*t, an unfamiliar emotion he couldn't place. They had been trying for a child for over a year.  
  
""Is that for a client?""  he asked, his voice flat.  
  
Caroline quickly closed the sketchbook. ""Just an idea.""   
  
He didn't press. He didn't care. His mind was on Ariana. He looked at the clock. He should leave soon. He wanted to be the first one there, to see her face when she saw the necklace.  
  
He stood there, a silent wall between them, when his phone rang. It was his best friend, Mark.  
  
""Blake! Turn on the news! Now!""  Mark's voice was frantic.  
  
Blake grabbed the remote and switched on the television. A live news report filled the screen. A building was engulfed in flames. Thick black sm\*\*e billowed into the night sky. The reporter's voice was urgent.  
  
""Firefighters are on the scene at the new Whitfield Gallery downtown, where a massive fire broke out just an hour before its scheduled grand opening...""   
  
Blake's bl\*\*d ran cold.  
  
Ariana.  
  
The world narrowed to that single thought. He grabbed his keys, his coat, and bolted for the door without a word to Caroline. He didn't look back. He didn't see the look of utter devastation on her face as she watched him go.  
  
Caroline followed him. She didn't know why. Some desperate, foolish part of her needed to see it for herself. She drove through the city, her hands tight on the steering wheel, her heart pounding a sick rhythm against her ribs.  
  
When she arrived, the scene was chaos. Police barricades, flashing lights, the roar of the fire. Blake had abandoned his car and was arguing with a firefighter, his face a mask of raw panic.  
  
""She's in there! I have to get her!""  Blake yelled, trying to push past the man.  
  
""Sir, it's too dangerous! The structure is unstable!""  the firefighter shouted back.  
  
""I don't care! She's trapped!""   
  
Mark was there, trying to restrain him. ""Blake, calm down! They'll get her!""   
  
""They're not fast enough!""  Blake's voice was ragged with a desperation Caroline had never heard from him. Not for her. Never for her. He looked at the burning building as if it held his entire world. In that moment, Caroline knew it did.  
  
He shoved Mark away and made a run for the entrance.  
  
""My hands!""  he screamed at the firefighter who grabbed his arm. ""Do you know who I am? I'm Blake Santos! These hands are insured for millions! They perform miracles! But I would trade them, I would trade my entire career, just to know she's safe! Let me go!""   
  
It was a declaration. A confession. A truth so brutal it felt like a physical blow.  
  
Mark saw Caroline then, standing in the shadows, her face pale. He looked horrified.  
  
""Caroline... I...""   
  
She heard Mark's wife, Sarah, wh\*\*per to him, ""God, Mark, he's been obsessed with Ariana since high school. I thought marrying Caroline would fix him, but he's just gotten worse.""   
  
Sarah's words confirmed everything. It wasn't just neglect. It was a love story she had no part in. She was just an obstacle. An afterthought.  
  
For three years, she had tried. She had loved him with everything she had, hoping that one day he would see her. She had decorated their home, managed his social obligations, comforted him after long surgeries, and endured his family's cold scrutiny. She had believed her love could eventually heal his old wounds, that it could be enough.  
  
It was a lie she had told herself. The truth had been there all along, in every missed anniversary, every canceled plan, every time he looked through her as if she were made of glass.  
  
The 100-point plan wasn't a game. It was a lifeline. A way to quantify the slow, bleeding death of her love. A way to give herself a finish line, an escape hatch from a marriage that was hollowing her out. And tonight, watching him ready to burn for another woman, she felt a massive chunk of those points crumble away.  
  
A cheer went up from the crowd. Blake emerged from the sm\*\*e, carrying Ariana in his arms. She was conscious, coughing, but otherwise seemed unharmed. He held her like she was the most precious thing in the world, his face buried in her hair. He carried her to the ambulance, whispering things only she could hear.  
  
He never once looked for Caroline.  
  
After ensuring Ariana was safely with the paramedics, Blake's body finally gave out. The adrenaline faded, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious from sm\*\*e inhalation.  
  
In the sterile white waiting room of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic sharp in her nose, Caroline's mind drifted back. She remembered the charity gala where she first met him. He was the most brilliant, captivating man she had ever seen. A star neurosurgeon from the powerful Santos family. She, a promising young architect, had been bold. She had pursued him.  
  
He had been grieving Ariana's marriage to another man. She knew that. But when he proposed six months later, she thought she had won. She thought her devotion had finally broken through his reserve.  
  
The illusion shattered a year into their marriage. At a party, she overheard one of Blake's friends, drunk and loose-lipped, telling someone the truth. ""Blake only married her because Ariana got married. He needed a distraction, a wife to satisfy his family. Poor girl thinks he actually loves her.""   
  
That was the day Ariana became a thorn in her heart, a constant, painful presence in her marriage. It was the day she went out and bought the plain black journal. It was her last act of self-preservation. A way to measure the pain until it became too much to bear.  
  
Ariana's return to Boston after her own divorce a year ago had accelerated everything. The points on her list disappeared with terrifying speed. Her heart, once full of hope, had grown cold and heavy.  
  
A doctor approached her, pulling her from her thoughts. ""Mrs. Santos? Your husband is stable. He inhaled a lot of sm\*\*e, but he'll be fine. Miss Whitfield is also fine, just a few scratches.""   
  
Mark and Sarah came over, their faces etched with pity. ""Caroline, he'll come to his senses,""  Sarah said, placing a hand on her arm. ""The Santos family will make sure he treats you right.""   
  
Caroline just looked at them, a bitter taste in her mouth. She stood up and walked out of the waiting room, leaving them behind.  
  
Back home, in the silent, empty house, she walked to the closet and took out the black journal. She opened it to the last entry.  
  
\-5 Points: He ran into a burning building for her.  
  
\-10 Points: He said he would give up his career for her.  
  
She uncapped her pen. Her hand was steady.  
  
\-10 Points: He collapsed after saving her, and his first and last thought was of her, not me.  
  
She did the math. Only a few points left. Very few. The end was near.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
The next morning, Caroline didn't go to the hospital. She went to see a lawyer. The office was on the 30th floor of a glass skyscraper, with a view of the entire city. It felt fitting. She was finally getting a new perspective.  
  
She handed over a file containing her prenuptial agreement and a summary of her assets.  
  
""I want to file for divorce,""  she stated, her voice calm and even. ""I want to prepare the papers now, so they are ready to be signed the moment I decide.""   
  
The lawyer, a sharp woman named Ms. Davis, looked at her with professional sympathy. ""Of course, Mrs. Santos. We can have everything drafted and waiting for your signal.""   
  
Leaving the lawyer's office, Caroline felt a strange sense of lightness. It wasn't happiness, but it was a release. She stopped at a small cafe and bought a container of chicken noodle soup and a thermos of hot tea, the kind Blake liked when he was sick. It was a force of habit, the ghost of a duty she had performed for years.  
  
When she arrived at the hospital, she paused outside Blake's room. Through the glass panel in the door, she saw Ariana sitting by his bed. She was trying to feed him soup, but her movements were clumsy. She spilled a spoonful on his hospital gown, then another on the pristine white sheets.  
  
""Oh, I'm so sorry, Blake!""  Ariana cried, dabbing at the mess with a napkin. ""I'm just so useless.""   
  
""It's okay,""  Blake's voice was hoarse but gentle. He reached up and wiped a tear from her cheek. ""It's just soup.""   
  
""But you're hurt because of me,""  she sobbed, her shoulders shaking. ""The doctor said the sm\*\*e inhalation was severe. It could have damaged your lungs, your hands... your career...""   
  
""Shh,""  he soothed her. ""It was worth it. As long as you're safe.""   
  
Ariana looked at him, her eyes wide and shining with adoration. ""You always wanted to be a neurosurgeon. You gave up your dream of being a painter for it.""   
  
Blake's gaze softened. ""I didn't give it up. I became a surgeon because of you.""   
  
Ariana looked confused. ""What do you mean?""   
  
""Do you remember that day in high school?""  he asked, his voice low. ""You fell off the bleachers and hit your head. You were unconscious for almost a minute. I've never been so scared in my life. That was the day I decided I wanted to be a doctor. The best doctor. So I could always be there to save you if you needed me.""   
  
The soup container slipped from Caroline's hand, falling to the floor with a soft thud. She didn't notice. The words echoed in her head, a deafening roar.  
  
His entire career. His life's ambition. It was all for Ariana.  
  
Ariana gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Blake... I never knew.""   
  
She threw herself into his arms, burying her face in his ch\*\*t. ""Oh, Blake.""   
  
He hesitated for only a second, his eyes flickering towards the door as if he sensed something. But then his arms wrapped around her, holding her tight. A perfect, painful tableau of love and devotion.  
  
Caroline felt a sharp, suffocating pain in her ch\*\*t. Her vision blurred. She turned and walked away, her steps silent and numb. She left the soup and tea on the floor outside his door.  
  
Downstairs, in the hospital lobby, she bumped into one of Blake's colleagues, Dr. Evans. He was rushing, a stack of files in his hands.  
  
""Caroline! I was just coming to see Blake. How is he?""   
  
""He's fine,""  she said, her voice hollow.  
  
""Good, good. Listen, I have an emergency surgery. Can you give this to him?""  He thrust a manila folder into her hands. ""It's his resignation paperwork from the research board. He needs to sign it.""   
  
""Resignation?""  Caroline asked, confused. Blake loved his position on the research board.  
  
""Yeah, he's stepping down to fund a new private clinic. Crazy, right? Sacrificing his own research... but he said it's for someone important.""  Dr. Evans's pager went off. ""Gotta run!""   
  
He disappeared down the hall. Caroline stood alone in the bustling lobby, holding the folder. Her hands trembled as she opened it. Inside was Blake's official letter of resignation. And clipped to it was the business proposal for the new clinic.  
  
It was a state-of-the-art mental health and wellness facility. The primary beneficiary and director listed on the proposal was Ariana Whitfield.  
  
The world tilted on its axis. It wasn't just his past. It was his future, too. Every part of his life was built around Ariana. He had become a doctor for her. Now he was giving up his prestigious research position to build a sanctuary for her.  
  
Caroline was just a name on a marriage certificate. A placeholder. A ghost in her own life.  
  
She thought of the day he'd been celebrated for a groundbreaking surgical technique. She had been so proud, her heart swelling with love for this brilliant, dedicated man. Now she realized, with sickening clarity, that even that moment belonged to Ariana. Every achievement, every success, was just another step on his path back to his first love.  
  
It was time to get off that path. It was time to find her own.  
  
She walked out of the hospital and into the bright, unforgiving sunlight. She pulled out her phone and dialed a number she hadn't called in years.  
  
Bridget Kelly. Her best friend from architecture school. The one who had always told her she was meant for more than just being Mrs. Blake Santos.  
  
Bridget picked up on the second ring. ""Caroline? Is that you?""   
  
""It's me,""  Caroline said, her voice surprisingly steady. ""You know that architecture firm we always dreamed of opening?""   
  
There was a pause, then Bridget's voice, full of excitement. ""Are you serious?""   
  
""I'm serious,""  Caroline said, a faint smile touching her lips for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. ""I'm leaving Blake. I'm ready to start.""   
  
""Oh, thank God!""  Bridget squealed. ""I'll start looking for office space! Something in Boston, close to your home, so it's convenient for you?""   
  
Caroline looked up at the skyline, at the towering buildings she had once dreamed of designing.  
  
""No,""  she said, her voice clear and firm. ""Not Boston. Somewhere new. Somewhere far away from here.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Caroline told Bridget she was getting a divorce and wanted to set up their firm, ""Phoenix Arch,""  in San Francisco. Bridget, ever loyal, asked no questions and immediately started making arrangements. The name felt right. A new life rising from the ashes of her old one.  
  
For the next week, Caroline lived in a blur of activity. She bought books on modern design, building codes, and business management. She spent hours online, studying the work of top architects, her mind once again buzzing with the creative energy she had suppressed for years. She felt a part of herself, long dormant, waking up.  
  
She didn't call Blake. She didn't visit the hospital. She ignored the texts from his mother demanding to know why she wasn't by her husband's side. She was building a firewall around her heart, brick by brick.  
  
A week later, on the day of their third wedding anniversary, Blake came home. He found her in the home office, surrounded by stacks of books and blueprints.  
  
He looked surprised. ""What's all this?""   
  
""I'm going back to work,""  Caroline said, not looking up from her drafting table. ""Bridget and I are starting our own firm.""   
  
""That's... great,""  he said, though he sounded more confused than pleased. He was used to her life revolving around him. ""I guess you won't have time to make my post-surgery recovery meals anymore.""   
  
Caroline finally looked at him. Her gaze was cool, distant. ""No. I won't.""   
  
He remembered how she used to fuss over him, a tiny papercut earning his hand a bandage and a week of her worried attention. Her sudden indifference was strange, but he dismissed it. He was tired.  
  
""Well, I support you,""  he said, the words feeling hollow even to him. ""It's good for you to have a hobby.""   
  
A hobby. Three years of marriage, and he still saw her lifelong passion as a hobby.  
  
""Blake,""  she began, her voice low. ""If I said I wanted a divorce, would you fight it?""   
  
Before he could answer, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen. It was Ariana.  
  
""Excuse me,""  he said, walking into his study and closing the door.  
  
Caroline could hear the low murmur of his voice, the gentle, soothing tone he never used with her. She didn't need to hear the words. She knew. She turned back to her blueprints, her resolve hardening into steel.  
  
Later that evening, he emerged from the study. ""I'm taking you out for our anniversary,""  he announced.  
  
She agreed. There was one last thing she needed to see.  
  
He drove them to a fancy downtown restaurant. He pulled up to the curb. ""I'll go park. You go on in.""   
  
She got out of the car and watched him drive off. A few minutes later, he returned, not alone. He was holding a huge bouquet of white gardenias and a beautifully wrapped gift box. For a dizzying second, her heart stuttered. He had never given her flowers. Not once.  
  
""Blake...""  she started, a flicker of some old, foolish hope igniting within her.  
  
And then Ariana appeared at his side, linking her arm through his.  
  
""Caroline! So good to see you,""  Ariana said, her smile bright and triumphant. ""Blake told me you were joining us to celebrate my gallery's successful relaunch. It's so sweet of you.""   
  
The flicker of hope died, turning to ash.  
  
Blake didn't seem to notice Caroline's frozen expression. He smiled at Ariana.  
  
""These are for you,""  he said, handing her the flowers and the gift. ""A little something to celebrate.""   
  
It was for Ariana. Of course, it was for Ariana. The dinner, the flowers, the gift. She was just the third wheel. A prop in their perfect love story.  
  
""Oh, Blake, you remembered,""  Ariana cooed, burying her face in the gardenias. ""They're my favorite.""  She unwrapped the gift to reveal the diamond necklace he had been so excited about. ""And this... it's the exact one I pinned on my inspiration board last month. How did you know?""   
  
""Just a lucky guess,""  Blake said, his eyes fixed on Ariana, a soft, loving expression on his face.  
  
Caroline felt the air leave her lungs. She was suffocating. She reached out and took the bouquet from Ariana's hands, forcing a smile onto her face.  
  
""Let me hold these for you,""  she said, her voice a strained wh\*\*per. Her hands were trembling.  
  
Ariana beamed. ""Thank you, Caroline. You're such a good wife.""   
  
The words were a mockery. Caroline knew then that Blake hadn't just brought her along. He had used her. He had used their anniversary as a cover to celebrate with the woman he truly loved. She was not his wife. She was his excuse.  
  
  
Chapter 4  
Ariana led the way into the restaurant, which was the same one where the accident had happened. It had been quickly renovated and reopened. She pointed out the new decorations, her hand resting possessively on Blake's arm.  
  
""I always dreamed of having a place like this, Blake,""  she said wistfully. ""A space for art and beauty.""   
  
""I remember,""  Blake said, his voice soft. ""You wanted high ceilings, exposed brick, and a crystal chandelier right in the center. You said it would 'drip starlight.'""   
  
Ariana looked at him, amazed. ""You remember that? I said that when we were seventeen.""   
  
""I remember everything you've ever said,""  he replied, and the sincerity in his voice was a knife in Caroline's gut.  
  
They were seated in a private booth. Blake took the menu, his eyes scanning it with practiced ease. ""We'll have the seared scallops, the truffle risotto, and the duck confit.""   
  
Ariana laughed, a light, tinkling sound. ""Blake, you ordered all my favorites. You should ask Caroline what she likes.""  She said it with an air of sweet concern, but her eyes, when they met Caroline's, were sharp with malice.  
  
Blake turned to Caroline, a blank look on his face. He pushed the menu towards her. ""Sorry. I... I don't know what you like to eat.""   
  
Three years. For three years, she had cooked for him, ordered for him, packed his lunches. He had eaten the food she prepared every single day, and he didn't know. He didn't know the simplest thing about her.  
  
The humiliation was a physical force, pressing down on her, making it hard to breathe. She saw the smug satisfaction in Ariana's eyes, the casual indifference in Blake's. It was all too much.  
  
""Excuse me,""  Caroline said, her voice tight. She stood up and pushed her way out of the booth. ""I need some air.""   
  
She walked quickly towards the exit, desperate to escape the suffocating weight of their shared history. She heard footsteps behind her. It was Ariana.  
  
""Let me show you the way to the powder room,""  Ariana said, her voice dripping with false kindness.  
  
In the empty corridor, Ariana dropped the act. She blocked Caroline's path.  
  
""You should just give up, you know,""  Ariana said, her voice low and cold. ""You see how he is with me. He remembers every little thing about me. He doesn't even know your favorite food. You're just a placeholder, Caroline. A temporary solution until I was ready to come back to him.""   
  
Every word was a confirmation of a truth Caroline already knew, but hearing it spoken aloud was still devastating.  
  
""He loves me,""  Ariana continued, her smile turning cruel. ""He built his career for me. He ran into a burning building for me. He's giving up his future for me. What has he ever done for you?""   
  
Caroline felt a wave of dizziness. The walls seemed to be closing in.  
  
""What do you want, Ariana?""  Caroline asked, her voice shaking.  
  
""I want you to leave,""  Ariana said simply. ""He's mine. He has always been mine. You're just in the way.""   
  
As she spoke, there was a loud creaking sound from above. Both women looked up. The large, ornate chandelier-the replacement for the one that had fallen before-was swaying ominously.  
  
A collective g\*\*p went through the restaurant, followed by screams.  
  
Blake came running. His eyes darted between the two women and the falling chandelier. There was a split second of hesitation. A choice.  
  
He lunged for Ariana.  
  
He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her back, shielding her with his body as the massive fixture of crystal and metal crashed to the ground right where Caroline was standing.  
  
The last thing Caroline saw before the world exploded in pain and went dark was Blake holding Ariana, his back to her, protecting the only person who mattered.  
  
She woke to the blinding lights of a hospital ceiling. Every part of her body screamed in agony. Her head was bandaged, her arm was in a cast, and a sharp pain radiated from her abdomen. The room was empty. There were no flowers. No concerned husband. She was alone.  
  
A nurse came in, her face grim. She checked Caroline's vitals.  
  
""You're very lucky, Mrs. Santos. You have a concussion, a broken arm, and multiple lacerations. But you're alive.""   
  
Caroline looked at the empty chair beside her bed.  
  
She reached for the small purse on her nightstand. Inside, wrapped in a silk cloth, was the black journal. She found a pen. Her hand ached, but she wrote with grim determination.  
  
\-15 Points: He watched a chandelier fall on me and didn't even try to help. He chose her.  
  
A young nurse's aide came in to change her IV bag. She saw the notebook. ""What's that?""  she asked, her curiosity piqued.  
  
""It's a scorecard for my marriage,""  Caroline said, her voice flat. ""When it hits zero, the game is over.""   
  
The aide leaned closer, her eyes wide. ""Wow. You're almost there. Only five points left.""   
  
Just then, the door opened, and Blake walked in. He looked tired and disheveled. He had been with Ariana. Of course, he had.  
  
""What are you two talking about?""  he asked, his gaze falling on the open journal in Caroline's hand.

But how does the machine know when it needs cleaning? Does it have sensors that can detect when there is a build up of limescale or does it just count the amount of coffees made and alert you for cleaning at certain intervals?

I'm wondering if you really need the filters if you are cleaning/descaling regularly anyway. Surely if the machine only counts the amount of coffees made then it would still prompt you for calc & clean at the same intervals whether you have a filter in or not. 

My cynical mind is telling me that Seimans are just trying to make more money off you by telling you, you need filters. They also say you need to purchase their own brand cleaning and descaling tablets 🤷

It costs less than my old café habit, but honestly the calm it brings me is just as valuable. i bought casabrew machine for saving money at first. but these days I find myself looking forward to the process as much as the drink itself.

Taxi apps like MojTaxi don’t work - not for me anyway. Some have had success from what I read on other posts.  (if anyone knows one that is fully reliable, please share).

Red Creven Taxi and Žuti Taxi both operate, but at 8AM I couldn’t get a booking. Žuti told me to call back in 10 mins, while Creven just picked up, left background noise running and I hanged up.

Basically, mornings can be tricky for taxis – I eventually found one at a taxi stand.

If you’re stuck, you can always ask someone nearby (like at a shop, café, or hotel) to call you a taxi. People are generally kind and willing to help.

Prices: Airport → city (near Marriott Residence Inn) with Creven Taxi was under 20 BAM.
City (near Marriott) → airport with Sarajevo Taxi from a stand was also under 20 BAM.


/////// experience ////////

Sarajevo is beautiful and the people are generally nice.

I rented a car to Mostar – stunning drive! Drivers aren’t that aggressive. If you’re tailgated, they’ll usually overtake when safe, or you can just pull over.

The drive itself is good but roads can be quite bendy and the speed limits vary a lot. If you’ve got driving experience, you’ll enjoy it. If not, maybe take the train or just drive a bit slower. This was my first time driving abroad on the right-hand side of the road and it wasn’t too bad – you get used to it. Having family or a friend in the passenger seat to help out is a bonus.

Food: Bosnian food is good but I found it a bit bland at times. Loved their smash burgers and fried chicken though.

Definitely try Bosnian coffee, but have it earlier in the day unless you want to be up all night.

Most food is halal, which is great if that’s important to you.

I’m creating a small Reset Circle for women who are in that season of life where things didn’t go as planned — maybe after heartbreak, burnout, or just feeling stuck — and you know something has to shift.

It’s not a course, not a program. Just a safe, supportive space where women (especially in our 30s, but open to 20s–40s) can gather for honest conversation, reflection, and connection.

Think of it like coffee with friends — but with more intention. Some weeks it might be a bi-weekly coffee chat, other times a walk-and-talk or a Zoom circle. Always rooted in resetting, rewiring, and rising together.

If this speaks to you, DM me or drop a comment. I’d love to connect and see who feels called to join.

I’m creating a small Reset Circle for women who are in that season of life where things didn’t go as planned — maybe after heartbreak, burnout, or just feeling stuck — and you know something has to shift.

It’s not a course, not a program. Just a safe, supportive space where women (especially in our 30s, but open to 20s–40s) can gather for honest conversation, reflection, and connection.

Think of it like coffee with friends — but with more intention. Some weeks it might be a bi-weekly coffee chat, other times a walk-and-talk or a Zoom circle. Always rooted in resetting, rewiring, and rising together.

If this speaks to you, DM me or drop a comment. I’d love to connect and see who feels called to join.

Because we don’t have to figure it all out alone. 💛",1,1756969841.0,Discussion,0,1.0,False

I met this guy last month, he was really sweet and we exchanged numbers. Talked a little bit, and eventually I went to see him. 
We talked for hours, it was so easy and effortless. Eventually he asked if he could kiss me and I said yes. 
Well the next day he was pretty affectionate. 
Kissed me every time he left the house, pulled me to his lap at one point - he was sad about something that had happened earlier in the day. After sitting with my head resting on his for a few minutes he said that he was very content. 
He said he wanted to see me again sooner than later. He also said we could watch a movie in his loft, maybe Pirates of the Caribbean. He hasn’t seen it in forever, and I like it too. 
He said lots of other things too, complimented my freckles and bought me coffee and cooked us dinner. 

I know some things he was just being nice or a good host. Like dinner. I offered to help and he said no, that he was hosting me and I didn’t need to do anything. 

But I guess I’m just a little unsure because some of the things he did or said seemed more intimate than just hooking up. But at the same time, what else would it be??

I am supposed to see him again on the 12th or 13th, as long as he doesn’t cancel on me. 

I’m excited to see him again but also feeling a little anxious about it maybe. 
The fact that I overthink everything probably isn’t helping. 

I’m fine with it if it’s just fun and that’s it. But the few intimate things he’s said and done just have me confused I guess. I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♀️",2,1756969768.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

OR he is Allah, Jesus, Iron man, He-man, superman, OR Krishna ?","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1n83cez,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallCruiseships/comments/1n83cez/new_ship_in_the_waters/,New ship in the waters,"River cruising has long been the domain of premium lines like Uniworld, AmaWaterways, and Viking. Starting in April 2026, Trafalgar is making waves with the launch of its own river cruise product. If you know Trafalgar for their guided tours, you’ll love the way they’re bringing that same thoughtful approach to the rivers of Europe.

Here’s what to expect.

⸻

The Launch: New Ships, Familiar Rivers

Trafalgar is chartering two sister ships from Uniworld, their Travel Corporation partner, to debut their program:
	•	Trafalgar Verity sailing the Rhine
	•	Trafalgar Reverie sailing the Danube

Both vessels were originally built in the early 2000s and recently refurbished. Think of them as comfortable, boutique-style ships with less glitz and glamour than Uniworld’s luxury fleet but perfect for a traveler who wants the river cruise experience without the premium price tag.

⸻

Itineraries to Watch

Trafalgar is starting strong with two of Europe’s most iconic rivers.

✦ Rhine River
	•	Best of the Rhine and Amsterdam (10 or 12 days)
Amsterdam to Basel, with options to extend in Lucerne.
	•	Rhine Christmas Markets (8 days)
Basel to Düsseldorf, decked out in festive holiday charm.

✦ Danube River
	•	Best of the Danube (8 days)
Budapest to Passau.
	•	Extended Options (10–12 days)
With extra time in Budapest and/or Prague.
	•	Danube Christmas Markets (8 days)
A magical December journey from Budapest to Passau.

⸻

Onboard Experience

You can expect Trafalgar to focus on connection, comfort, and cultural immersion.
	•	Cabins
	•	Deluxe river-view staterooms (151 sq. ft.)
	•	Classic staterooms with unique low-level windows
	•	Dining
	•	Buffet breakfast and lunch with a live cooking station
	•	À la carte dinner menus spotlighting regional dishes
	•	Wine, beer, soft drinks, and coffee included with lunch and dinner
	•	Amenities
	•	Lounge and bar
	•	Games room, small gym, and sun deck
	•	Afternoon tea and casual entertainment like movies, music, and themed nights
	•	Extras
	•	Guided excursions with audio headsets
	•	Bikes available for independent exploration
	•	Signature Trafalgar “Be My Guest” and MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® experiences

⸻

Pricing and Promotions

This is where Trafalgar shines. Pricing is notably more accessible than the ultra-luxury lines, starting around $1,995 per person for an 8-day Danube sailing.

Special launch offers include:
	•	$1,500 savings per couple on select 2026 sailings booked by September 30, 2025 using promo code TR26IOS.

Sample starting prices:
	•	Best of the Danube (8 days) from ~$1,995 pp
	•	Best of the Danube with Budapest extension (10 days) from ~$2,445 pp
	•	Best of the Rhine and Amsterdam (10 days) from ~$2,577 pp
	•	Rhine Christmas Markets (8 days) from ~$3,207 pp

⸻

Who Is This For?

Trafalgar River Cruises will likely appeal to:
	•	Travelers curious about river cruising but not ready to commit to a luxury price point
	•	Fans of Trafalgar guided tours who want the same style of cultural immersion on water
	•	Holiday travelers looking for festive Christmas Market cruises at a more approachable budget

Just 300 push-ups and 400 squats for today, and I'm ready to get the day started. I've got the second cup of coffee brewing and will get to work as soon as I've finished my last cup. That reminds me, I need to get some fresh coffee. I'm currently working abroad, my schedule has shifted a bit, and I find myself in a part of the world that is quite wonderful. I enjoy the sunrise very early in the morning, around 5:40 a.m. Yesterday, I ran 6 miles and finished with some leg exercises.

I'm feeling pretty fresh at the moment, despite my other responsibilities and the project I'm currently working on. There's a difficult step in my project, and I know it's going to take some time, and the efforts I've already made make it seem quite daunting. So I'm kind of tired and refreshed at the same time, or in other words: peacefully stubborn.

My topic for today is “Sanguinity on rainy days.” Ironically, the weather is looking good right now. Yet I find the idea of being optimistic in bad times quite fitting, because that’s when it’s most important, and that’s when I’ve felt that something has changed at the root of some unpleasant things in my life. Just like a flashlight that you use at times when you really need to see whats in front of you, optimism is very useful in difficult times and especially when you have a difficult graps on clarity, in the midst of heavy emotions.

I learned this in 2018, and it was a turning point that led me in a whole new direction with a painful touch of courage. I came home from work and had prepared my much-used comfort kit for a possible relapse. Before I got started, I made one last attempt, made a warmline call, and pressed the stop button for that moment. After letting off some steam and chatting, letting the craving sit next to me and being blinded by the lights, I stepped aside and left it the way it was, sitting in that pain for a short moment before going to bed.

I carried that experience with me, and before I even realized it, it had planted a seed at a pivotal moment in my life, one that grew into something strong and lasting. So today, I will simply try to keep my composure as best I can, and when everything goes dark, I will try to press stop, let it rest for the moment, and leave it there so that I can start fresh with a new day.",1,1756969689.0,HealthyHabitsJournal,0,1.0,False

*June 16, 2025*

I'm 98.7% sure that I am not the AH here, but I'm wrong I'm willing to admit it and learn from my mistakes.

Our little boy will be one late this summer, so this was the first mothers day and fathers day for both me and my husband. My husband asked what I wanted for mothers day. I didn't want/need anything big or expensive. What I asked for is:

* For husband to get up with the little guy and get him fed while I pumped and chilled
* Breakfast in bed - just toast, scrambled eggs and coffee
* For us to take the little guy to the zoo for the first time. This was the main thing I was looking forward to.
* Go to my fav taco place for dinner

Between morning and afternoon naps we have about 4 hours of awake time. The zoo is abt 30 min away so I had figured if we left as soon as he got up from his nap and ate, we'd have a couple hours at the zoo and worst case he could sleep in the car on the way home.

We took my mom and my MIL out to brunch the prior weekend to celebrate them- his mom on Saturday and my mom on Sunday.  I also got them each a thoughful little present and flowers to celebrate their first mothers day as grandparents. I arranged everything and told my mom and MIL that we'd be celebrating on the actual day with just our little family and sent them a group chat (which included husband, my dad and FIL) just to make sure everyone is on the same page. My MIL is very pushy and overbearing so I didn't want there to be any surprises or confusion.

The Saturday before Mother's Day, FIL sent my husband a text with a picture of all the mulch he just had delivered and said something like ""gonna be a busy weekend!"" or something like that. Apparently he had 300 bags of mulch (they have a big yard with lots of flower beds). That night my MIL called my husband and asked him to come over first thing in the morning to help his dad move the bags of mulch to where they were going to be used. She said since we weren't going to the zoo until after little guy's nap, that husband could go over and help for a couple hours and then come pick us up to go to the zoo. I was obviously not happy but she guilted him and said FIL was going to end up hurting himself if he moved all that by himself and that its not a big deal and should only take an hour or two. I told him his mom was doing this to try and get us to skip our plans and spend the day with them but he kept saying it's not a big deal, saying his mom promised it would only take a couple hours, etc etc.

I think most people know what happened - husband went over first thing, which means no breakfast in bed and I had to get up to feed the little guy. I was kinda pissed, but whatever. Spent time with the little guy then when he went down for his morning nap I texted my husband to let him know he should start wrapping things up. Then when little guy woke up 2hrs later I called husband to tell him I'd be ready to go as soon as I finished feeding the little guy. He told me it was taking longer than he expected but that he'd hurry. Like an hour and a half later husband called and said they weren't done but he was getting ready to come home.  It's 15-20 minute drive from MIL/FILs house. At that point we'd missed the window to make it to zoo so I told him to just stay there and finish and not worry about Mothers Day since he hadn't done a single thing I asked for. I don't think there wasy any doubt in his mind how pissed I was. A little later his mom called and said since we decided not to go to the zoo, that me and little guy should go hang out with her while ""the boys"" finished with the mulch. I admit that I was pretty pissy and told her I had no interest in spending time with the people who decided to ruin my first mothers day. I ended up staying home and ordering a pizza and binging Netflix.

When husband got home he was all apologetic and asked how he could make it up. I was still pissed and told him he could make it up by not ruining my first mothers day. I also told him he should plan on spending Fathers Day with his mom and dad bc me and the little guy were going to go celebrate Fathers Day with my mom and dad.

Since Mothers Day MIL has been texting and calling but I've been keeping conversations short and just giving very bland generic responses.

My husband has been apologizing and asking what he can do but honestly I don't want to bother. I know it's just a day and we can celebrate any time, like we did with my mom & MIL. But it was my first ever Mothers day. And it's not like I asked for anything expensive or difficult. The only difficult thing is he's incapable of setting boundries with his mom. And she's incapable of considering anyones feelings but her own.

This past Saturday he asked if I was still going to my parents then said he'd like to go with us. I told him he could do whatever he wanted but since I hadn't done anything for his dad he might want to go see him or something. We did both end up going to my parents and spending the day with them. It was actually a nice day. My dad insisted on grilling because of course he did but the weather ended up being nice and we spent a lot of time hanging out on their deck playing with the little guy.

I'm not sure what if anything my husband did for his dad. I know he was getting a lot of texts during the day, I assume from his mom. She did send me a snippy text saying it was hurful to spend the day with my family at the expense of husbands but I told her she got to spend Mothers day with her baby boy so it's only fair that I spend Fathers day with my family.

I know my husband was hurt that we didn't acknowledge him for Fathers Day but I told him while we were driving to my parents house that I'm just matching his energy. I admit that I haven't done anything to de-escalate the drama but I'm still just so hurt he continues to prioritize his mom's feeling over our little family. This isn't the first time his mom has done crap like this and I'm just so tired of it. She always oversteps and insists on doing what SHE wants. I'm doing better at keeping her at arms length and holding my own boundries but my husband is absolutely incapable of it.

># Comments by OOP:

- 

Technically we've tried to alternate holidays or celebrate with one of our familys on a different day but his mom calls & texts nonstop if we spend a holiday with my family. I already told him this Christmas we are spending Christmas Day at home, just the three of us. That should be interesting to see what tricks MIL pulls out.

- 

I think I was trying to convince myself he'd come though for us. Lesson learned.

- 

To be fair, if I really wanted to keep him from our son, I would have gone to my parents without him. I expected his mom to guilt him into going over there for Fathers Day. And after what she pulled on Mother's day I wasn't going to reward her by letting her spend yesterday with our son.

- 

lol actually my mom & I get along really well. She can be overbearing and pushy too with the difference being when I tell her to back off she does. But she said the same thing a lot of people her are saying. That I'm justified in my feelings but if we end up going down this path we won't be married for long. She thought I should accept his apology and let it go and give him the chance to do better.

- 

My husband can suck sometimes, but generally (when his parents aren't involved) he's a good husband and good dad.

- 

We're both only children. But his mom is waaaaaayyyyyyy more invested in his life than either of my parents. My mom can be a pain, but when I ask her to stay in her lane she usually does.

- 

*[somebody says YTA because she did it on purpose and her husband didn't]* Even if I don't necessarily agree with comments like this, I still appreciate them. Reddit can be such an echo chamber sometimes, it's good to get different opinions and perspectives. But you do bring up something that has been a niggling thought which is why I posted in the first place. Because of our history and how often this sort of thing has happened before, I respectfully disagree with you. But just the fact it made me pause tells me it's a valid consideration.

- 

I think this was just the last one in a long line of this kind of behavior and really pushed me over the edge because it was so important to me. I did want him to have an idea about how he made me feel. I think it impressed on him how hurt I was. But you are right this isn't sustainable. I'm feeling like we both did some serious damage to our marriage and we need to figure out how to fix it.

- 

It's because this kind of thing has happened lots of times. But this time it ruined something that I thought was really important to me

*June 23, 2025, 1 week later*

I posted here last week, you can find it in my profile if you want the backstory. I wanted to thank everyone. I've had a lot of people asking for an update, so here we go.

This weekend the husband and I sat down and talked about everything. I expressed to him how incrediably upset and disappointed I was at how both Mother's Day and Father's Day went down. I really wanted to recognize and celebrate my husband for FD everybit as much as I hoped he would recognize and celebrate me for MD. He said he knew he shouldn't have gone to his parents on MD but didn't know what to do since his mom was pressuring him and saying if his dad got hurt it would be husbands fault. He admitted that he knew he messed up and has been terrified that I was going to ask for a divorce. 

Since he cut to the chase, I told him that if this is how our life is going to be, I don't want to stay married to him. I explained to him that I realized that while yes, I was upset about what happened on Mother's Day, that isn't what is making me feel this way. That was just the straw the broke the camels back. This kind of behavior from his mom has been happening since we before got engaged and has just escalated. This has been happening for YEARS. As someone here suggested, I had listed all the times/events (that I could remember) that she had overstepped or just completely ruined. For our freaking honeymoon, she called him TWICE A DAY. Every monrning to find out our plans for the day and then every evening to hear how the day went. Plus the constant texting, asking for pictures, telling him how much she missed him. I don't know how I thought this was acceptable. She tried to make our wedding about herself, tried to make my pregnancy about herself, tried to take over when we brought our son home, just constantly inserting herself and overstepping.

I told him that I don't really want to get divorced right now, but it's going to happen anyway, I'd rather get divorced now while we can still do it amicably. Because if nothing changes I'm going to end up so angry and resentful that it would make divorce very contentious and I don't want that for our son. At this point we were both crying, upset and emotional. So I told him that I'll give him some time to decide what he's going to do but if I don't see clear effort being made to start prioritize me and our son that I'd move forward with the divorce. And the change has to continue. Everytime we've fought about this in the past, he's promised he'll change and sometimes he has, but then his mom pulls him back into her orbit.

If we are to stay married - these are some of the things I'm insisting on in no particular order:

* We each own the relationship with our own parents. That means I'm not planning anything for his parents anymore. No cards, no presents, no burnches or parties, no pictures, nothing. If his parents reach out to me I'm going to redirect them to him.
* I'm not entertaining or visiting with his parents when he's not around. I'm not taking our son over to theirs by myself. And if they ""drop by"" I'm not inviting them in unless my husband is there.
* I'm not changing my plans at the last minute just because they decided to drop by without coordinating with us in advance or because they want us to do something with them.
* Neither of us makes plans with our parents or accepts invitations until we discuss with our partner. And if we don't both agree the we don't do it. And we don't throw each other under the bus, we just say something like ""we checked our schedule and we're not available"".
* Holiday's like Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc are at our house. We can discuss inviting our parents but we're not going to someone else house to celebrate something involving our son when we can do it at home. This includes his 1st bday which MIL is trying to take over and plan.
* Other holidays we're alternate between our parents. And we will focus on being present. That means no more texting/talking to his mom non-stop when we're with my parents.
* No more oversharing with MIL. She doesn't need to know about our finances or health/medical issues or vacation plans or anything unless we both agree its something we want to share. 
* His visits to his parents can't be at the expense of spending quality time with me and our son. I don't mind him visiting his parents, but he's over there a couple times a week. We are his immediate family now, we should get priority. 
* We're not doing things just because she said we should. And we're not changing our plans just because she doesn't like them. She really doesn't understand that ""Wrong"" and ""Different"" are not the same thing. In her mind, if we're not doing what she wants, HOW she wants, then we are in the wrong. 
* He needs to go to therapy with someone specializing in emeshment. And we need to start going to couples therapy. I didn't even realize I have so much pent up resentment that I can't look at my husband the same anymore. I'm just angry at him all the time and I hate being this way.
* When it comes to our son, our word (husband and me) is law. If she disregards or minimizes our decisions for our son, then she looses access until she learns to behave.
* When me or my husband say ""No"" to either set of parents, the other person will support them and back them up. That means my husband has to stop trying to get me to agree with his mom all the time.

I can tell he's freaked out and really stressed about the idea of putting hard boundries in place or distancing from his parents. And I do feel for him. He said he feels like he's caught between a rock and a hard place and that me and his mom are both putting a ton of pressure on him and both have conflicting expectations. And that's fine. He just needs to understand that I'm not tolerating this anymore. I know this will cause an absolute shit storm with his parents but I feel like if we don't do it now, it'll just be harder down the road.

What does everyone think? Am I being unreasonable? Are there other boundries we should put in place?

He did seem overwhelmed, and admittadly it is a lot. I wouldn't expect it all at once but this is where we have to end up and I have to see progress and change. I'll sit down with him again tonight and start having that conversation. I want him to be successfull. I want US to be successful. And I'm willing to put the work in and to also help support him, but he will need to do the same.

- 

I think his mom is at least partially responsible for some of his earlier relationships ending. I'll make sure to point this out!

- 

I feel like this is my last chance to try and turn this around. If it happens, that is on him. And I think it will just show that he'll never be ready or able to have an healthy, adult, romantic relationship.

- 

I would never allow my parents to act or treat him the way his act and treat me. If we do get divorced, at least I'll be able to say I tried my best and gave him every opportunity.

- 

What I was trying to say is if things are going to continue as they have been, I'd rather get a divorce. But, if he is willing to put the effort in to improve our marriage and make real change, then so am I. All my boundries apply to both of us, there is nothing I'm asking him to do that I don't already do (or aren't will to do) with my parents.

But yes, if he's just going to say ""Things will get better"" without trying to make them better, I'd rather just be done and get the divorce.

I absolutely don't want him to be my bi_ch. I know I can be hard headed and opinionated. And I want a partner that will call me out and stand up to me when it's warrented. And a partner that will support me and have my back when that is warrented. And I want to do the same for my partner.

- 

That is one of my fears. I don't want to have to be a nanny reminding him to behave and be a good husband/father. That's not what I meant to sign up for. If thats what ends up happening then this won't work out.

- 

I've always hesitated to do this because I didn't want to come off as a nagging wife, but I realize now I was just enabling the status quo. But you are right, we need to have some way of providing feedback to one another and being able to communicate in an open and healthy manner even if the underlying topic is toxic

- 

It was an absolutely brutal and heart wrenching conversation. I never want to have to do that again. But I'm terrified that he won't follow through and the next conversation will be even worse. I don't think we ended the discussion because we were done. We were both just to wrung out to continue. Also part of the reason I want couples therapy is becasue I don't want to have to do that alone again.

- 

I don't mind helping and supporting him. That's part of being married. I know he's going to stumble and trip sometimes. We all do. I'm not perfect, I'm going to screw up too. And I'm happy to help him. But I can't do it for him, he has to want to make a change. And if he does, I'll be there. And if he doesn't, then that's a whole different conversation.

- 

It's not just that she called everyday. It's that he answered the damn phone even when I got upset and told him I thought it was ridiculous.

- 

And I'll be honest - what really really pisses me off not is that I didn't make a bigger deal. It pissed me off, and I told him it pissed me off, but I never followed through. I just let him say things like ""she's excited for us"" or ""she misses us"" and the next time she called I'd roll my eyes and say something passive aggressive then when they hung up we'd carry on with what we were doing. I should have been more explicit that I didn't think it was acceptable. I'm not saying I expected no contact - I texted my parents when we landed at our destination, and then again when we were on the plane to go home. But that was it. And their only response was ""have fun"" and ""have a safe flight, can't wait to see you"".

And I see my folks probably every 2-3 weeks and they live about the same distance as his parents. So I don't have a problem with him going to visit. But that often? Really?

- 

Because I was young and stupid and really believed that ""love conquers all""? Because I really believed once we got married he'd stand up for us? Then I really believed once we had kids he'd make us his priority.

Trust me, these are all thoughts I've had. And now I'm in the situation where I have a son, that I love more than anything. So I can't wish I had left because I'm so grateful for my son, but I also can't stay anymore if this is going to be my future.

Right now, how I ended up here is an interesting academic question. Answering it won't fix this, although maybe it will help me avoid being in a similar situation if we get divorced. The important questions are can this be fixed, and how.

*[somebody comments she seems to have the same character as MIL and to let MIL have some things]*
We've been together 8 years, married 5, and our son will be 1 later this summer.

My whole point is I'm trying to keep her from ruling my house. She doesn't want to be ""a part"" of anything, she wants to own and run everything the way she wants. The reason I listed all these rules as you call them is because these are all areas where she has completely ignored what we want and imposed her will on us. I can't tell you how many times we've had plans that she insisted on us cancelling or changing or including them on. And yes, he SHOULD have said no but whenever he's tried she pushes and guilt trips and threatens until he gives in.

Did you read my first post about what happened on mothers day: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ld5j35/aitah_for_not_planning_anything_for_fathers_day/ ?

That kind of thing is entirely typical of her and her behavior.

Which of my rules do you think is unfair or unreasonable? I'm asking because I'm really curious. I feel like all these are things in a normal marriage you'd just have a conversation about and decide where to go for the holiday or whatever. But that's never worked with her, if we don't do what she wants, how she wants, when she wants, then she starts with the manipulation.

Do you really think it's ok that she called him twice a day for our honeymoon? or that she texted him constantly? or that when we are doing a holiday at my parents she keeps calling and texting? or that when we plan a trip she convinces him we shouldn't go? Or that she tricked him into spending mothers day at her house and skipping all the plans we had made?

I think if my MIL and my husband had a normal, even slightly healthy relationship, you'd be right. But I honestly think she sees him as an extension of herself and not a full grown individual who can make his own choices and live his own life.

- 

If my husband wants to tell his mom about his health, that is entirely his choice. But why does he need to tell her about my health/medical issues/Dr appointments/etc? Why does she need to know how much I earn or how much I have save up or how much I paid for my car or any of that? How is that her business? If we decide to take a trip why do we need to tell her how much we're spending?

And why does visiting her take priority over plans we made? I can't count the number of times we were doing something together where he bailed because she needed help with something stupid. Or the number of times plans got canceled because suddenly she wants him to come over.

If he wants to devote all his time and effort to his mom that is absolutely fine. But he can't do that and still be an involved father or engaged husband. What happens when our son is older and my husband has to choose between attending his school events or games or whatever. Because yes his mom won't be around forever, but our son won't be a child forever. What happens in 18 years when our son goes to college and my husband realizes he missed seeing him grow up because he was busy catering to his mom.

And I won't be a third wheel in my own marriage. I won't spend my marriage wondering what plans she is going to screw up or what decisions we make that she's going try and override.

It's not about sharing info or visiting. It's when those things happen to the extreme and impact our life as a married couple.

># [Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lis1eu/update_aitah_for_not_planning_anything_for/)
*September 3, 2025, about 2 1/2 months later*

I've had a lot of folks asking for an update, so here goes!  First off, thank you all to everyone who commented on my earlier posts, good and bad, it has been so helpful.

Couple things I want to mention first. A lot of commenters have been saying that I knew what I was getting into when I married DH so this whole thing is as much my fault as anyone elses and if I didn't want a mama's boy, I shouldn't have married one. Yep, you are 100% correct. I ignored all the red flags, constantly told myself it would get better once we were engaged, then once we were married, then once we got pregnant, then once we had kids. And I think part of the issue is she's gotten worse over the years. It feels like one of those frog-in-a-pot-of-boiling-water situations. I don't deny I put myself into this situation but the fact is we're here now so we need to get it figured out. A lot of other commentors said my ""list of rules"" was crazy and I'm just as bad as his mom. Maybe I am (more on that later), but I don't think there is anything about my boundaries that is unreasonable and there is nothing there that I expect from him and his parents that I don't also expect from myself and my parents. I've said repeatedly, they all boil down to the same basic thing: showing each other respect and consideration. I'm not saying he can't see his parent or that they can't come visit or anything like that. I'm saying that his parents don't get to have priority over us and our little family, and neither do my parents. 

First the good. My husband ended up surprising me with a trip out of town. He took me and LO down to San Antonio for a long weekend. We had been pre-kid and really enjoyed staying on the riverwalk and doing all the touristy stuff even though we only live a few hours away. DH ended up really stressed and kept apologizing because obviously this trip was much different. It felt more like a military expedition with all the gear we took for LO and it wasn't nearly as romantic since we had a pack-and-play next to the bed. But I kept reminding him that what was important (to me at least) was that he took the initiative to plan something on his own and try to make up for Mother's Day. Even though it wasn't exactly what hubs was hoping for, I had a really really good time and enjoyed spending time with my two guys and I expressed that to him. And to his credit, DH didn't answer when his mom called or spend all day texting her. I know he paid for it when we got back because I heard them on the phone and it sounded like she was reading him the riot act for not telling them we were going, not inviting them along, and not answering when she called. I'm going to do something for him as a belated fathers day and we're going to try to build different, better memories of our first MD/FD, even if it's after the fact. 

More good stuff, DH and I both have individual therapists we've been seeing weekly for the past several weeks as well as a couples therapist we have been seeing weekly together. And I'm going back to work full time next week so LO has been going to daycare part time to help him acclimate. The first day was pretty traumatic, more for me than for LO! But, he's been adjusting well and seems happy when I pick him up after lunch (this is a huge point of contention with MIL b/c she wants to baby sit but I've said absolutely not because she won't respect any of our rules or boundaries). I've also been following through on my list of boundaries on my last post. I'm not NC, but I guess the term is I've dropped the rope. 

Now the bad. For LOs first birthday I was planning something small and casual at our house. Just our parents, and a few close friends. Like, 10-15 people max, counting me and DH. I was going to make a smash cake for LO and more grownup type food/snacks/desert for us and guests. I was planning some low key decorations because lets be honest, this kind of party is for the adults. Kiddo isn't going to remember any of it so I didn't want to go overboard. MIL hated everything about it and wanted to do it at her house, invite all her friends and relatives, serve more kid-centric food, get a store bought cake with all that super sweet icing, and go nuts with decorations. I told her 'no, absolutely not. Our kid, our house, our plans'. She went crying to DH and he tried to talk me into letting her have her way. This has been a constant theme. MIL oversteps, I complain, DH puts up boundaries, and then just as quickly DH forgets about the boundaries.

We were able to talk about this in one of our early couples sessions and it was pretty enlightening. I'm sure all the people saying DH just ended up marrying some just like his mom will be gratified to know our counselor said ""OP can have a forceful personality"". So yea, I'm bossy/pushy/opinionated/etc. How it came up is we were talking about the party and I was saying what I wanted to do and why I didn't want to let my MIL take over, etc and DH was trying to explain why we should accommodate MIL. The therapist interrupted us and ask DH what ***HE*** wanted to do. DH started talking about my plan vs his mom's plan and the therapist stopped him and asked again what ***HE*** wants. Based on his reaction, I don't think anyone has ever seriously asked him that. He had a complete deer in headlights look and I really though he was going to bolt or start crying or both. 

How we ended it is, if he truly doesn't have an opinion or doesn't care then he should probably defer to my (his wife) approach. He shouldn't delegate his right to decide to his mom. If he really want to do it her way, then he needs to express that and say he wants to do it her way because he really wants to do it her way as opposed to doing it her way just to avoid upsetting her. Or if he wants something completely different, he needs to express that. But his mom's opinion is not and cannot take precedence. Nothing wrong with her expressing her opinion and him agreeing but that needs to be an active process as opposed to him just doing something because she said so. 

That was followed up by a conversation about how I have strong thoughts and opinions and I need to give him room to have his own. So rather than saying: ""I want to do x"" and then expecting him to agree or disagree I need to say something like ""For LOs birthday, I have some ideas but I'd like to hear what you think first so we can decide together"". 

We did end up doing the party the way I wanted because DH took the therapists advice and deferred to me since he didn't have an opinion. MIL was super pissy about the whole thing and ended up bringing a sheet cake despite me telling her multiple times not too. We didn't serve it during the party (because boundaries) which pissed her off. DH and I have been munching on it as a late night snack after putting LO to bed and because of how insanely sweet the icing is, I'm glad I stuck to my guns. 

I feel better because I've put distance between myself and MIL and I'm not worrying about pissing her off so I'm not walking on egg shells any more. But I don't know if I'm any more confident about whether our marriage will survive. I'm realizing that DH has deferred to other people (MIL and me) for so long he has a hard time having his own thoughts and opinions. I do still love him very much, and I'm not as mad as I was when I first posted. Now I'm more sad for him and I'm starting to understand him better. But I don't know if he can change. I know she is complaining to him because I haven't been kowtowing to her and I haven't been visiting on my own or changing plans when they drop by unexpectedly but I'm not pushing him to establish his own boundaries yet. I think he needs to do more work so he can decide what **HE** wants out of all this.

All that to say, we're still working through it and I don't know what's going to happen.

1n838qu,https://i.redd.it/9yo9hrcsj3nf1.jpeg,House Of Kanaan - Overall Review of 8 fragrances.,"I got introduced to House of Kanzan via Instagram earlier. I love tea forward fragrances for office and I got their Poets of Kyoto (that's the one not in the photos). 

Poets of Kyoto - Typical Tea forward fragrance. Mild and becomes a skin scent quite quickly. My gripe is it's not long lasting but since my office has a (almost) no scent policy, I keep it to 1 spray (it stays in my office) and given the particular circumstances it does its job. On a sunny day outside, I don't think it will last beyond 2 hours. 
⭐⭐⭐ Plus ✨ that's it's gone unreported to HR for 6 months  Out of 5

Matcha Magnétique - It's running where Poets of Kyoto walked. The opening is bergamot and yuzu heavy almost like a citrusy slap (in a nice way). After 15 mins, the heart blooms and I got magnolia and grass but no bamboo. And the dry down is also pleasant with cedar (I didn't get any other notes despite voracious sniffing). Like any other fresh fragrance it opens with a bang but ain't long lasting. 
⭐⭐ Plus a little ✨ for using yuzu

Golden Jazz - Since I have both By the fireplace and Jazz Club by Maison Margiela and this one feels like Jazz club on a budget (fragrance wise not money wise). I think there are better dupes out there. But on its own - it's whiskey forward but they could have blended it better. Unlike a citrus slap, I didn't appreciate a whiskey slap but thankfully it calms down and then due to tonka bean in heart and vanilla in the drydown it turned too sweet (for me). But it's long lasting and it has got me compliments . For long lasting - I got 5hrs in ac.
⭐⭐ out of 5

Tigers in Paris and Letter I Never Sent - clubbing these since they are softer fragrances. Both are my wear at home or to book club meetings. Tigers in Paris hasan underlying sweetness throughout thanks to the saffron and sandalwood. Letters has a champagne opening but again quickly mellows. Both become skin scents and tiger has a slightly louder opening. 
Tigers and Letters both - ⭐⭐⭐ out of 5

Hazy Reflection - I just love it. It's a simple everyday no fuss, won't offend anyone fragrance. I can wear it to walk my dogs, shopping or for a coffee. Not a compliment getter - unless ofcourse you do. But il on my second bottle.
⭐⭐⭐⭐ (I just wish it was longer lasting). 

Murasaki Bookshop - Just not for me. And I tried to like it cause in theory the notes go perfectly together. But on my skin it just doesn't works sadly and the burnt opening is too strong for me. 
⭐ Sorry

Since I ordered 4 together they have an offer on their website that they send a house scent and they sent me Incense d'Orient - it's what it is - I have worn it twice and I think it will get more usage in the winter months. 

Main Pro - I like their varied offering and their quality at their price. 

Main Gripe - Longevity sucks compared other offerings in this price range.",6,1756969304.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,9,0.88,False

# What Makes a Song Score High?

I've made some significant improvements to the rubric to be **less judgmental on themes** like infidelity, violence, or dishonesty, focusing instead on craft and authenticity.   
  
Songs are anchored against well-known classics for calibration. For example:

* “Strange Fruit” — Billie Holiday | 9.7/10
* “Eleanor Rigby” — The Beatles | 9.4/10
* “Fast Car” — Tracy Chapman | 9.2/10
* “Life on Mars?” — David Bowie | 9.1/10

The common thread? **Emotional authenticity and imaginative imagery.**

**What's Working:**  
Lines with specific, concrete details often score well.  
*Example: ""Your coffee cup still sits on the shelf, / I talk to it and then I hate myself.""*

**Common Challenges (To Think About):**  
Some common themes can be tricky to execute originally. These often appear in lower-scoring tracks:

* Using weather (rain, storms) to symbolize sadness.
* Common religious imagery (angels, demons, heaven).
* Fire/light imagery (flames, stars) for passion/hope.

**Please Avoid:** (Yes people submitted these)

* Your song about pregnancy-shaming your daughter... .... ....
* Your song about bodily functions (Please no)
* Your song about racial slurs

Honestly, I didn’t expect much, but it’s been surprisingly effective.

It’s this tasteless powder you stir into your coffee — no weird flavor, no clumps — and it’s packed with natural ingredients like Ginkgo Biloba, Quercetin, L-theanine, and Green Tea Extract. The combo seems to make a real difference in:

* Staying focused during long work sessions
* Remembering details more clearly
* Feeling alert but calm (instead of jittery)
* Avoiding that mid-afternoon crash

1n835sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/myinfolabs/comments/1n835sf/live_life_happily/,Live Life Happily," *Living happily means enjoying the small moments, being kind to yourself and others, and finding joy in everyday life.*

Life is full of ups and downs, but choosing to live happily is all about focusing on the good things around you. It doesn’t mean everything will always be perfect, but it’s about finding reasons to smile even when things get tough.

One of the best ways to live happily is to appreciate the little things — a warm cup of coffee in the morning, a good laugh with friends, or simply a quiet moment outside. These small moments add up and remind us that happiness is often right in front of us.

Being kind to yourself is also key. Sometimes we get caught up in what we haven’t done or what’s going wrong, but it’s important to remember that you’re doing your best. Treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a good friend.

Connecting with others makes a big difference too. Sharing your thoughts, helping someone in need, or just spending time with people you care about brings joy and a sense of belonging.

Finally, don’t forget to follow what makes you feel alive — whether it’s a hobby, a dream, or something new you want to try. Happiness often grows when you’re doing things that truly matter to you.

In the end, living life happily is about balance: enjoying the present, being kind, and holding on to hope for tomorrow. It’s a simple choice that makes every day a little brighter.

1n8352r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Decor/comments/1n8352r/stylish_home_decor_ideas_for_every_space/,Stylish Home Decor Ideas for Every Space,"[**Home decor**](https://dbeautify.com/search?q=sculpture&options%5Bprefix%5D=last) is the art of turning a house into a home. It’s about creating spaces that feel inviting, comfortable, and uniquely yours. Whether you live in a cozy apartment or a spacious villa, the right decor ideas can enhance your interiors and reflect your personality. From modern minimalism to warm and eclectic vibes, stylish home decor ensures every room feels thoughtfully designed. If you’re looking for inspiration, here are some creative and practical home decor ideas for every space.

# 1. Living Room Elegance

The living room is often the heart of the home where you relax, entertain guests, and spend quality family time. Elevate it with a statement sofa, layered rugs, and accent lighting. Add a large wall art piece or a gallery wall to make a bold statement. For cozy vibes, throw blankets and cushions in different textures will make the space more inviting.

# 2. Bedroom Comfort

Your bedroom should be your sanctuary. Choose soft, soothing color palettes like pastels or earthy tones to promote relaxation. Layer bedding with plush throws and pillows for extra comfort. Bedside lamps or pendant lights create a calming ambience. Don’t forget personal touches like framed photos or decorative candles to make the space truly yours.

# 3. Dining Room Charm

A stylish dining room sets the tone for family meals and gatherings. Consider a modern dining table paired with upholstered chairs for elegance. A chic chandelier or pendant lighting above the table can instantly elevate the setting. Add a centerpiece fresh flowers, candles, or decorative bowls for a polished finish.

# 4. Kitchen Style and Function

The kitchen is both functional and social, so decor matters. Sleek cabinetry, open shelving, and well-placed lighting make a big difference. Add pops of personality with decorative jars, stylish bar stools, or a backsplash featuring bold tiles. Small indoor plants or fresh herbs in pots can bring life to the space.

# 5. Bathroom Sophistication

Bathrooms are no longer just functional spaces they can be mini-retreats. Opt for elegant mirrors, stylish storage baskets, and chic dispensers for a coordinated look. Add scented candles, greenery, or even a statement rug to make the space feel spa-like and luxurious.

# 6. Home Office Creativity

With remote work becoming more common, your home office deserves attention. Keep it clutter-free with minimalist shelves and stylish storage. Choose a comfortable chair and desk that fit your style. Wall art, motivational quotes, or even a vision board can boost productivity while maintaining an aesthetic look.

# 7. Hallway and Entryway Impact

First impressions matter, and your entryway sets the tone for your home. A console table with decorative vases, mirrors, or artwork creates instant style. Adding a runner rug or wall hooks for coats and bags makes the space both practical and welcoming.

# 8. Outdoor and Balcony Bliss

Even the smallest outdoor space can be transformed into a relaxing escape. Add comfortable seating, outdoor rugs, and string lights for a cozy vibe. Potted plants and lanterns enhance the mood, making it a perfect spot for morning coffee or evening relaxation.

# 9. Stylish Textiles and Accessories

Accessories can make or break your decor. Cushions, curtains, throws, and rugs add color, texture, and warmth to any space. Mix and match patterns or stick to a theme for harmony. Decorative trays, candles, or vases on coffee tables and shelves also add a finishing touch.

# 10. Smart Home Decor

Modern homes are increasingly embracing smart decor. Sleek smart speakers, hidden charging docks, or automated lighting can merge convenience with style. These elements add sophistication while keeping your space practical and up to date with modern living.

# Conclusion

Home decor is more than just arranging furniture it’s about creating spaces that feel beautiful, functional, and personal. Whether it’s adding wall art in the living room, cozy textiles in the bedroom, or stylish accents in the kitchen, every detail contributes to the charm of your home. With the right ideas, you can transform every corner into a space that reflects your style and personality.

After my initial appointment with a clinician, I was prescribed 30mg to be taken daily for 2 weeks then 50mg for a further 2 weeks and a review in the form of a telephone call after that.

I am on holiday this week so it was agreed that I would start taking the medication regularly when I get back on the 10th, but I decided to trial a 30mg dose the day before I went while I had work to see how it affected me.

I am also prescribed 40mg fluoxetine daily and I took the elvanse on an empty stomach, followed by breakfast and fluoxetine. I had a cup of coffee with my breakfast as well as when I arrived at work.

When the elvanse started to take effect I could tell, as I was laser focused on my tasks while listening to music. However, a couple of hours later I started to feel very lethargic, and I didn’t have any appetite suppression which is one of the most common side effects, I ate my lunch without issue at 12:30pm which was meant to be the peak effects as I took the elvanse at 7am. After I had my lunch, I was reading a book for the remainder of my lunch break and I could focus on the book but it was like my eyes were forcefully being closed, I did not feel stimulated at all.

Later in the day I got even more tired and I’m pretty sure I started falling asleep and getting minor hallucinations and delusions such as seeing a black stick man running across my computer screen and thinking there was someone next to me when there wasn’t. These effects concerned me but I believe it was more due to the sleep deprivation than the medication as I am now aware it is more effective if you get proper sleep.

So my question is, when I start taking elvanse regularly, assuming I try get 7-8 hours of sleep every night from then on, will I still keep feeling drowsy or will that side effect fade and I will start to feel more stimulated as my body adjusts to the medication?",1,1756968372.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

The kind of stuff I used to do was OC stuff and roleplay inspired ones. 

Gonna be super honest. If we don’t share similar hobbies I really will lose interest. Sorry about that. 

Big passion is creating art and writing roleplays or character backstories sometimes. 

FFXIV and the island sanctuary take up my free time sometimes when I’m home. Otherwise I’m just kind of staring at my screen or trying to figure out how to make more til, lol. I love watching like 18th century cooking stuff or arts and craft stuff. I also like going through weird deep dive stuff and sometimes it’s true crime related or urban exploration. 

I love national parks, museums, botanical gardens, coffee shops, going to cons, uuuhhh other stuff that will come up. Oh oh collecting little trinkets. Gundam kits, blind box stuff, having alone time.

1n82pf4,https://i.redd.it/8b76uueod3nf1.jpeg,I got my promotion to… customer.,"I got to work as usual in ON stocking and got notified that I was technically fired by points…. Because of last night that despite I used ppto I got pointed because I failed to call out, which is was a mistake of mine. Yet, after seeing four people that same night everybody gave me false hopes. I still can’t believe that from 3 points went to 6.

But the TL told me… “for this night you can work.” Tomorrow we have to meet with the coach (to tell me I am fired basically). And sent me to dairy to find this mess where I had to do double work pushing away all the crates of milk  to stock all the milk and coffee creamer — as you can see in the pic— so, even after that they told me that I was technically fired, I had to break my back not just with this pallet but with other four ones in dairy.

— They didn’t care how much I worked or how well I did my job, which is something I disapprove, besides, among the people in overnight I never have seen so much apathy and indifference in other places.

Come on! I am fired but this night I can work… that’s plain ridiculous. Especially with the amount of work they imposed to me.

So in the first break, I left everything in the fridge, didn’t say nothing, took my belongings and went away in my car.

Soon I’ll be waiting for a call to pick up my check, I guess.

From my experience, I swore never work overnight anymore in other company. But surely I’ll have to look for a job even at my 53. I feel relieved but also the commitment to find a job.

1n82n9w,https://i.redd.it/nbpkxrdjc3nf1.jpeg,When Fear Shows Its Teeth,"It always begins quietly. A shadow crackles under the skin, as if someone deep inside me had left a door ajar. 03:11 a.m. The night is a cold room, the fridge hums, the wall clock pretends time is harmless. My heart stumbles, my chest grows too tight, the air too sharp. I stand there with wet palms and think the sentence that never gets old: *This time it will tear me away.*

Panic isn’t theater. It’s an ancient protocol meant to save you, even when there’s no fire in the house. Some would say: “False alarm, same sirens.” Or: “Your system means well; it’s just off on timing.” Adrenaline flips on every light at once—pulse up, breath shallow, muscles ready—the saber-toothed tiger is coming. The problem isn’t that your body gets loud. The problem is believing you have to calm it on your own.

I once believed courage was smooth. That courage had no sweat stains, no trembling voice, no stutter. Now I know: courage is keeping the trembling hand open. Courage is staying *here* while everything in you screams: *Run.* Courage is looking down—tile, edge, tiny nick—and choosing to breathe right there, even when breath feels like it’s being pulled through barbed wire.

When the wave comes, I think of my she-wolf, my instincts. Not romance. The old, instinct-sure strength that knows how to move through storms. The she-wolf in me stands head lowered in the wind. She doesn’t run. She scents. She tests. She knows: noise is not the same as danger. And if danger were real, she wouldn’t spin into hysteria—she would slow the cadence. Inhale. Exhale. Paw by paw. I call her when the body burns. Sometimes she comes as a memory—of a forest path, the smell of rain on soil, the crack of a branch. Sometimes she comes only as an idea: *I am not defenseless. I am as old as my breath.*

I wish I could say it never hurts. It does. And there are nights I sit on the bathroom floor, angry at my own heartbeat. But I know the shape of this curve now. It rises, it threatens, it fades. No panic lasts forever. That’s not comfort; that’s neurobiology. If you stay—don’t fight, don’t shove it away, just accompany—it, your system learns to turn the siren back down. The she-wolf calls that patience. She bares her teeth, but she doesn’t bite her own throat.

Shame is fear’s quiet accomplice. “Pull yourself together.” “Don’t make such a fuss.” I’ve buried sentences in my head that once tugged me like leashes. Now I say softly: *I’m scared right now.* And it’s as if an invisible hand shifts my ribs a little so there’s room again. Whoever stays then is my pack. Whoever looks away may go in peace. Closeness that can hold panic doesn’t need big words. An “I’m here”… and the she-wolf lies down beside me and breathes with me.

I know my traitors: too little sleep, too much coffee, days without intervals. And I know my allies: water and bread, salt on the tongue, cold metal against the palm, the five senses as anchors—see, hear, feel, smell, taste—not as an exercise but as a recall to now. I move chairs until the room fits me again. I choose the aisle seat on trains, the edge in the cinema, the door in sight. Not out of cowardice. Out of sovereignty. It’s the she-wolf’s art to choose paths that keep her strong.

Sometimes—and that’s the hardest— the body tells stories. A smell like that hallway back then. A sentence that hits the old echo. A hand movement, too quick, too close. And suddenly an earlier self is in the room, thin as glass. I used to despise myself for that. Now I call my body a good archivist. It lays files on my desk, unsorted, but asking to be seen. Therapy taught me to stamp **NOW**. Not every knocking is a break-in. Sometimes it really is just the mail.

I write this because I see you. You who count the emergency exits in the supermarket. You who stare at your hands in meetings because your heart is too loud. You who lie in bed and swear you’ll start living tomorrow, if only *this* feeling would finally pass. And then the wave returns, uninvited like a bad song. Listen: you are not broken. You are an attentive animal in a world that yells too often. Your nervous system isn’t your enemy. It’s a guard that drums too early. You’re allowed to retrain it—quietly, repeatedly, kindly. The she-wolf calls that training the noise, not the soul.

There are days I laugh in the middle of a movie theater. Not because the film is so good, but because I’m sitting in the middle. There are traffic lights where all I feel is wind. There are evenings I turn the key and know: today I made it through without an escape plan. Freedom isn’t a fanfare. Freedom is the third normal breath after a storm. And when fear returns— it does; it’s part of me— I meet it at the front door. I let it in, but I don’t hand it the wheel. *Sit.* *Breathe.* *We’re not driving tonight.*

A stab in the chest: realizing no one is coming to save us, and also that we are not defenseless. That someone lives in us older than any panic. One who knows the forest. One who knows how to quiet the false alarm. That healing doesn’t mean never trembling again, but knowing where to put your hands when it begins. On the tile. To the pulse. On the chest. And into the gaze of those who stay.

If you’re crying now, that’s not failure. It’s water finding its way through hard earth. It makes you soft enough to hold yourself. And if nothing else works, make it as primitive as possible: count my words until they match your breath. *In. Out. In. Out.* I’ll stay here until the she-wolf lies down again. We are not less because we are afraid. We are true. And truth lasts longer than any wave.",1,1756967030.0,u_ElectricalRadish2039,0,0.99,False

About me: I’m super into cozy gaming—think Stardew Valley or cozying up with some Sims, but I’m game to try your favorite RPG if you’re down to teach me. I love wandering Seattle’s quirky spots, like grabbing coffee at a cozy café, hitting up Pike Place for some foodie finds, or catching live music at a small venue.

1.	⁠Before Bed: Quickly Create a ""Sleep-Ready Atmosphere""

•	Fix a ""screen-off"" time: Turn off your phone and computer 1 hour before bed. If you must use your phone, enable ""grayscale mode"" and ""Do Not Disturb"" to reduce blue light exposure, which disrupts melatonin production.

•	Simplify your pre-sleep routine: Avoid intense exercise or engaging with mentally demanding content (such as work or complex storylines). Instead, soak your feet for 10 minutes (in 38-40℃ water) or listen to white noise—helping your body form a conditioned reflex that ""these activities mean it’s time to sleep"".

•	Control pre-sleep intake: Avoid milk tea, coffee, and alcohol 3 hours before bed. If you feel hungry, only have a small amount of warm milk or half a slice of whole-grain bread to prevent digestive discomfort from affecting sleep.

2.	⁠Adjust Your Schedule ""Little by Little""—Don’t Rush

•	Step 1: Track your current schedule (e.g., sleeping at 2 AM and waking up at 12 PM). Each day, shift your bedtime and wake-up time forward by 15-30 minutes (e.g., from 2 AM to 1:45 AM, and 12 PM to 11:45 AM). Gradually move toward your target schedule (e.g., sleeping at 11 PM and waking up at 7 AM).

•	Step 2: Force yourself to stay awake after waking up: Get out of bed immediately, open the curtains to let sunlight in (sunlight suppresses melatonin and boosts alertness), and drink a glass of warm water. Avoid ""lying in bed for just 5 more minutes"" to prevent falling back asleep.

•	Key tip: Don’t disrupt your rhythm on weekends. You can wake up up to 1 hour later than on workdays, but no more than 2 hours—this prevents repeated reversal of your biological clock.

3.	⁠Daytime Habits: Lay the Foundation for ""Good Sleep at Night""

•	Spend 15 minutes walking or doing stretching exercises during the day to consume moderate energy. If you feel sleepy in the afternoon, take a nap for no more than 20 minutes (a quick doze only), not over 1 hour—this avoids insomnia at night.

•	Never use your bed for activities like phone-scrolling or watching TV during the day. Let your body recognize that ""the bed is only for sleeping"" to strengthen the exclusivity of the sleep environment.

4.	⁠Persistence: Allow ""Occasional Mistakes"" and Use Rewards for Motivation

•	If you stay up late occasionally, don’t feel anxious. Get up as planned the next day (you can take a 20-minute nap during the day if needed) and resume your adjustment schedule on the third day.

•	Reward yourself when you meet your goal for 7 consecutive days—such as watching a movie or buying a favorite book. Positive feedback will help you stick to the new routine.",1,1756966867.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

The brew unit motor recently failed on my CM6350.

I sourced a new one online, fitted and all looked good.

Unfortunately, it now turns out that the water for the portion is being entirely pushed into the drip tray - I observed it coming through the rubber boot behind the drip tray when it is supposed to be dispensing a coffee. 

The pucs in the waste tub are also now not pucs, they are entirely dry ground coffee. 

It seems like the water isn’t being diverted through the brew unit.

Is something else broken? Have I inadvertently purchased the wrong brew unit motor? 

I checked the hoses in the machine and I’m pretty sure they are all connected properly - only two were removed to let me access the motor. 

Thanks.

The scene goes like this. There’s this older guy (either in his late 50s or early 60s) with a mustache and he’s wearing like a Hawaiian shirt. He kills the receptionist of the police station and then he pretends to be the receptionist when this fat cop shows up. He lowers the fat cops guard and then he shoots him to, fat cop falls into a coffee table dead. Then he makes his way to back of the police station hunting down this black girl cop. He shoots at her with like an uzi but doesn’t kill her. Eventually he runs out bullets and had to reload so the girl cop takes a chance and runs into the room with the holding cell. She closes the door before the old assassin can get her and since the doors made out of some strong metal, the assassin can’t shoot through the door. There’s a guy in the holding cell and he knows the assassin. Him and the assassin get into some witty banter through the metal door as the cop is in the corner. And that’s where the scene ends. The only other information I can give is the film is either from the 2010s or 2020s and the old assassin might’ve had a southern accent. ",1,1756966656.0,tipofmytongue,5,1.0,False
