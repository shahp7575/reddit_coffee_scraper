1ojtx4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1ojtx4p/a_question_for_folks_in_dusty_places/,A question for folks in dusty places,"Okay, this one’s for anyone living in really dry or dusty parts of the world. I’m one of those people, which is why I’m posting this.

Last year, I had a small accident — spilled coffee on my laptop. I took it to a repair shop where they took it apart, cleaned, and dried the motherboard. Luckily, everything still works fine. I did notice a bit of dust and that was after owning it for 3 years most of which I was living in the US.

At the time of the accident, I was living in a different city that wasn’t nearly as dusty. But now I’m in a much drier place, and it’s wild how fast dust settles here. If I leave my laptop for just an afternoon, I come back to a thin layer of dust across the keyboard and screen.

My worry is that, over time, that buildup could cause damage. I know most devices aren’t really made for these conditions, so I want to be proactive about taking care of mine.

So I’m curious — for those of you who live in dusty areas, do you take extra steps to protect your computer? And if so, how often do you clean or service it?",1,1761811941.0,macbookpro,0,1.0,False

for a while I've had a Profitec Pro 300 paired with a Baratza sette 270. I've always made 'decent' coffee with it, but I've never been super serious about dialing it in or similar.

I just got it back from a service/repair, and I thought this time I would make the effort to make sure it's making really good espresso - that being said, the problem I am about to describe was also already before this repair.

I've noticed that the espresso shots are extremely sour - I'm using local fresh beans, a proper tamper, even a puck screen with a bottomless portafilter. I also filter the water.  
From what I can tell, it looks to be running through properly.

For the grind - I've had to go down to 3E to even get close to where I need to be in terms of timing; I've been using 19g and aiming for 38-40g output. Here is my outputs

1: 19g in, first drip after 3 seconds, let it run for 15 seconds and got 56g out. Grind was 7E  
2: 19g in, first drip after 3-4 secs, let it run for 19 seconds, got 72g out. Grind was 5E  
3: 19g in, first drip after 5 sec, let it run for 28 seconds, got 58g out. Grind was 1E  
4: Here I just stopped the machine when I got the target out, same settings as 3; It was done after around 18 seconds to get 40g. This one tasted extremely sour, completely undrinkable.

I'm kind of stubbed here; could my grinder be at fault and it's not grinding right? I've tried a few things here in there, but I can't seem to get anywhere close to the 19g - 25-30 seconds - 36g output. Am I taking crazy pills?",1,1761811597.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

 I'm 34F, Around 130 pounds, on my feet a lot walking and eat pretty well for the average person.

I can't remember exactly when this all started but at least 5 years ago, I started having bad bowel movements. I ignored it for a long time until I realized it was every time I went for probably too long. I had just assumed it was the coffee or beer I drank the night before. Then every once in awhile I started to notice I was urinating very frequently, so I assumed maybe a UTI. I went to a walk in and they told me it was negative. One day I went to another walk in for my big toe feeling numb and that doctor gave me a referral for some blood work, but I put it off because I end up feeling better. 
Later in Jan 2022 I went 51 days before getting my period. I get a new referral from my GP and we test iron, thyroid, liver, kidney, and all the blood related tests like WBC, RBC, platelets, etc. Everything comes up fine. I complain to my doctor about my bowel habits still being bothersome (basically not quite diarrhea but very loose stool every time) and we talk about trying 2 weeks without gluten and then adding it back in and then doing the same with dairy. This was very difficult for me to even start to attempt because of my lifestyle/schedule but I also work in a brewery/restaurant. So again, time goes on and I eventually try cutting gluten. I felt better and oddly my dry skin looked much healthier but I had also gone on fluoxetine for anxiety pretty much the exact time that I tried removing gluten. I add the gluten back and I get a horrible dull but persistent almost throbbing headache and I never get headaches. So I ask to have the celiac blood test and that comes up negative. I was definitely skeptical of that since I survived off gluten my whole childhood but I'm not a doctor. I basically tell my doctor well I guess it could be IBS then? And he talks to me more about mental health.

 I can't remember why it came up but I suspect I had the frequent urination again because that has persisted so in 2023 we did the A1c and glucose testing which also came up fine. I basically am at my wits end mentally with this so I try going to a naturopath (again skeptical) I decided to do the 96 igg food panel test and my results were: a bunch of different foods came up as low level sensitivities- chicken, turkey, wheat, black tea, coffee, carrot, mushroom, corn, rice, oats and more. Maybe that's normal though. I only had one level 2 sensitivity which was to Brewer's yeast!! But how accurate are these types of tests and could it explain allll of my symptoms?? Could the yeast one have been higher simply because I consumed more beer and bread? 

I stopped taking fluoxetine and I hadn't had too much trouble with my anxiety. I'm still eating gluten but I try removing dairy. My digestive issues seem to clear up..had it been dairy all along? When I eat something like a cheesecake or cream pie type dessert it is bad news. I even get external hemorrhoid flare ups. So I avoid most dairy now. 

Now in 2025 I feel pretty good with my digestion but I seem to feel hungry even after eating sometimes. I feel like I need to eat lean meat, fresh vegetables and healthy grains or starch like potato or rice to feel full and satiated. However, my stomach is sensitive to fat. In the past I've vomited after eating an overly greasy burger patty. I've had bad bowel movements after eating pork ribs or lactose free ice cream. I also experience some weird feelings like I can feel cramps from ovulation most months. My lower back around my pelvis like 3 inches above my tailbone as well as down my left buttock seems to always be in pain. I went to a chiropractor and after a few visits he thinks I'm fine. Then I very recently had a 38 day cycle and just before it started I think I urinated about 20 times within 24 hours. I feel a weird pressure in my bladder or uterus area until my period comes on. I have that same period right now and my lower left pelvic area is basically throbbing. It could be normal PMS symptoms but I guess I worry about the irregularity of it since I had been pretty consistent lately. 

Anyways..this is long and there is a lot to it but I'm basically wondering if I'm overthinking things or if I should be asking my doctor for more tests. I still kind of worry about blood sugar because I do drink and after a night of more than a couple I feel super hungry all day and urinate more. I have super dry skin all the time too. I feel like you're supposed to drink 8+ glasses of water a day but every time I drink anything it seems like it comes right out again. I also have a bad routine because of my work schedule and I eat my dinner quite late. My husband used to be a chef and we both worked in busy restaurants where you are too busy to eat until after everyone else has. I wanted to save money and not eat at work (there aren't as many healthy options either) so we would eat together at home and it could be right before bedtime. I'm trying to change my routine and eat breakfast right away when I wake up and meal plan more so I'm not starving myself as much. 

I just don't know if this is a result of aging, lifestyle, mental health issues (anxiety or even possible undiagnosed ADHD), drinking too much or something more serious. What would you do?? Thank you in advance if you read this far! ",1,1761811458.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The camera pans down from the construction site, where a giant crane maneuvers a steel beam, to the gridlocked street below.

In a line of three vehicles:

1. A truck (Gary and Rey).

2. A red sedan (Maria).

3. A black SUV (Sarah, Chloe, and Liam).

Mark, a pedestrian, is walking along the sidewalk.

Inside the SUV, Sarah, Chloe, and Liam are listening to the radio. R.E.M.'s ""It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"" is playing. A bee flies in and stings Sarah’s hand.



The Vision (The Unfolding Disaster)

1. Trigger: In the crane cab, a gust of wind spills the operator's coffee onto the console. The crane violently swings the metal beam like a wrecking ball, smashing the side of the half-built building.

2. Crane Demolition: The steel beam swings back with full momentum and takes out the crane cab, knocking the massive structure down and crippling the building.

3. Victim 1: Rey (Crushing) & Mass Casualty: The first pile of debris—a massive concrete slab—crushes the passenger side of Gary’s truck, instantly killing Rey and a dozen others on the street.

4. Victim 2: Gary (The Diagonal Slice): Above, a floor collapses, and a stack of glass panes slides off the edge. Gary crawls out the driver's side window only to be caught by a falling pane that slices him diagonally across his torso.

5. Victim 3: Mark (The Bisection) & Mass Casualty: Mark tries to walk between Maria’s and Sarah’s vehicles. Maria, shocked by Gary's death, panics and backs up, pinning Mark’s legs. An explosion is triggered behind the construction fence, blowing up 5 nearby pedestrians. The blast propels a piece of the steal fence  right at mark, taking Mark out and leaving his bottom half pinned between the vehicles.

6. Victim 4: Maria (The Impalement Anchor): Maria flees her vehicle. Steel rebar slides off a rack. One rod hits in front of her, forcing her to look up, where three more impale her, pinning her to the ground. One goes down her throat and out her back.

7. Victim 5: Liam (The Decapitation/Fragmentation) & Mass Casualty: Liam leads Sarah and Chloe toward a safety tunnel entrance, but a thick steel cable snaps and whips through the crowd, decapitating Liam—exploding his neck and bottom jaw—and taking out 11 others in a similar, horrific manner.

8. Victim 6: Chloe (The Incineration) & Mass Casualty: Sarah trips. Chloe runs ahead, unaware Sarah fell. On the other side of the tunnel, a tank explodes, turning the funnel into an incinerator, instantly cooking Chloe and 9 others.

9. Victim 7: Sarah (The Final Crush): The whole funnel collapses, pinning Sarah to the ground. She looks around, seeing bodies crawling in the rubble, before the remainder of the structure collapses and crushes her and the last of the survivors.",3,1761810222.0,FinalDestination,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with the “sweeps casino” side hustle that’s been circulating online lately, specifically from the perspective of a Canadian.

There are far fewer sweepstakes-style casinos available to Canadians compared to Americans, which made the setup a bit trickier. Still, after going through the hassle of getting everything figured out, it’s been worth it.

I’ve been doing this for a few months now, and I’ve made a couple thousand dollars in total. It’s not life-changing money, but it’s a solid, low-effort side hustle that fits nicely into my routine. I usually just collect the daily free tokens while having my morning coffee. It takes maybe five minutes. Then, once or twice a month on a Friday night, I’ll play through those free tokens and try to convert them into redeemable tokens.

The nice thing is that there’s no real “buy-in” required if you’re patient. It’s all about consistency, collecting your daily bonuses, playing smart, and cashing out when you hit something worthwhile.

If anyone else here is doing this from Canada, I’d be curious to hear which sites you’ve had success with or how your experience compares. I can also share a few of the ones I’ve found that actually work here.",1,1761809908.0,EasyFreeMoney,0,1.0,False

Placed order and they asked if I wanted to round up for some charity. I declined. At the window, the guy says “Sorry, we don’t have pennies.” and gives me change minus the few cents I am owed. He said “That’s why we ask if you wanted to round up for the donation.” which kind of makes me think that is a scam now. 

Of course I don’t care about the money but this bothered me on principle. Why wouldn’t this place give the customer the benefit of them not having pennies by rounding up the change to the nickel?

When I complained, the guy deferred to a woman who looked like a manager or assistant manager. She gave me some excuse about not having changed the menu signs yet and their bank not giving them pennies. Anyway, I completed the transaction by giving them enough pennies from my car stash of loose change to get the correct amount back.

Then it happened again! A couple weeks later at Burger King on w11th. “Sorry we don’t have pennies”. This time I straight up asked them to take the hit and just give me the nickel. He got permission from the manager and did.

So, WTF? These places should change their menu prices if they are going to not have pennies, or at least not make the customer pay more for their shortcoming. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

A somewhat related phenomenon I’ve experienced a few times at various local corporate places over the years is them asking me “Do you want your change?” when it’s change smaller than a dime.

The chamber smelled of burnt metal and fear.

White walls, silver restraints, and that high-pitched hum that always came before the screams. I used to hear it and feel proud the sound of progress. Now it just felt like the slow breathing of something hungry.

The subject in front of me couldn’t have been older than twenty. A girl, maybe nineteen, thin wrists shaking against the straps. Her eyes darted from me to the ceiling lights, searching for mercy where there wasn’t any.

“Zenos,” said one of the assistants behind the glass. “Subject 241-Blue, light manipulation. Proceed.”

I nodded, raised my hand.

The glow started between my fingers blue at first, then gold. I pressed it into her chest, felt the surge ripple from me into her, bones humming, muscles tightening. She screamed, back arching against the straps.

“Hold— hold her!” one of the medics shouted.

Too late.

Her body convulsed once, violently, and went still. Smoke rose from the electrodes.

The monitors flatlined.

I stood there, hand still glowing, staring at what I’d done. Again.

“Subject failure,” the assistant said coldly. “Log and replace.”

Log and replace.

As if she’d been a broken circuit board.

I stepped back, my chest hollow. My hand trembled as I turned off the power channel.

“Clean the table,” I muttered, though the words barely made it out.

When I left the room, I heard the hiss of a body bag closing. The sound followed me all the way to the elevator.

⸻


The elevator doors opened to the main hall — marble floors, gold insignias, portraits of every Golden Cape who had ever “served humanity.”
My boots echoed in the silence.

James was at the far end of the corridor, surrounded by journalists. His voice carried effortlessly: smooth, controlled, charismatic.

He was smiling.

“…and that’s why the Association’s Evolution Program is the next step for mankind,” he said. “We’re ensuring safety, order, and opportunity for all citizens — no matter their origin.”

Applause. Cameras flashed.

Behind the lenses, two guards were pushing a stretcher with a covered body into a maintenance tunnel.

I stopped. Watched them disappear.

When James finished, he turned — and his eyes landed on me. That practiced smile widened. “Zenos! There you are, brother!”

The cameras swung toward us.

He threw an arm around my shoulder. “This man right here he’s the miracle worker behind our progress. The reason so many are alive and strong today. Give him a hand!”

Applause again. Empty, thunderous applause.

I forced a smile. My throat felt like glass.

After the cameras turned away, James leaned close, his voice low enough that only I could hear.
“You should be proud. You’ve done more for humanity in a year than most people do in a lifetime.”

I met his eyes. “And the ones I killed?”

He blinked  slowly, deliberately  and smiled again. “Collateral. Evolution’s never clean, Zenos. You know that.”

He patted my shoulder, as if I’d just asked something childish, and walked away. The reporters followed him like moths.

I stood there, in that shining hall, feeling smaller than ever  just one more cog in a machine that used corpses for gears.

By nightfall, I couldn’t take the noise in my head anymore. So I went where I always went when I needed answers — to the one person who’d ever given me honest ones.

Sônia’s office smelled of jasmine and ink. She was standing by the window, city lights reflected across her face. For a second, I thought she looked older than I remembered — not weaker, just… heavier.

She turned as I entered. “Zenos,” she said softly. “I heard about the new fatalities.”

I stopped at the doorway. “You always hear.”

“Sit,” she said. “Tell me what you see when you close your eyes.”

I hesitated, then sat. “I see them. Every one of them. And I keep thinking… maybe I’m the only one who does.”

Her lips twitched, almost a smile, but not quite. “That’s why you still have a soul.”

“I don’t want it anymore,” I said. “It just makes it hurt.”

She came closer, resting a hand on the table between us. “Then stop using it to carry their pain. Use it to change why they die.”

I met her eyes. “You still want to bring down Almair?”

“I always did,” she said. “But I couldn’t without proof. Now we have it and now we have you.”

She turned on a holo-display. The footage played the same room I’d been in, but from another angle. Screaming, light, failure. No faces. No names. Just the horror itself.

“This is what the public will see,” she said. “A glimpse of what the Association does in the dark. It will spark outrage. Enough for the politicians to demand reform. Enough to build my schools  safe, gradual, human.”

“And what happens to Almair?”

Her eyes were cold. “He burns.”

I nodded slowly. “Then I’m in. I’ll keep working, but I’ll report only to you. We’ll end it from within.”

She smiled faintly — a rare, tired smile. “Welcome to the real Association, Zenos.”

⸻


When I left Sônia’s office, the corridors felt different  colder, quieter. As if the walls themselves were waiting for something to collapse.

“Hey, Goldie,” a familiar voice called from behind. James, leaning against the wall near the training sector, his golden cape draped carelessly over his arm. He looked perfectly calm, like a man who’d never seen a drop of blood in his life.

“Busy day?” I asked.

“Always,” he said. “Walk with me.”

I followed. We stopped outside one of the private chambers. Inside waited a woman I vaguely remembered her; I think she was the woman he was with at the bowling alley, but a Bard with a girlfriend at work is nothing new. 

James grinned. “Zenos, meet Katrina.”

She smiled politely. “It’s an honor.”

James clasped her waist lightly. “She’s been training off the grid. My father thinks she’s… special.”

He turned to me. “I need you to give her a little boost.”

I frowned. “Now? Why not bring her to the Evolution Room?”

“Because this is personal,” he said, tone soft but firm. “Just a minor enhancement. You trust me, don’t you?”

His voice carried that effortless authority — the same tone Almair used. I hated how easily I nodded.

I placed my hand on Katrina’s shoulder, pushed just enough energy to make her veins glow faintly silver. She gasped softly  not in pain, but like someone tasting power for the first time.

“That’s enough,” James said quickly, stepping between us. He smiled too wide. “Perfect. You’re a marvel, Zenos.”

He thanked me, and before I could ask anything, they were gone.

For a long time, I just stood there, staring at the empty room. Why had he wanted it so carefully controlled? Why keep it hidden?

Something about it didn’t sit right.

⸻

That night, when I finally called Elis, her voice was the only thing that made the world feel human again.

“I talked to your mother,” I said. “I’m with her now. We’re going to stop him  Almair. For real.”

She was silent for a heartbeat. Then, softly: “You mean that?”

“I do.”

I could hear the tremor of relief in her voice. “You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to hear that.”

I smiled, though she couldn’t see it. “We’ll fix it, Lis. I swear.”

There was a pause, then a quiet laugh. “You sound like my father when he still believed in miracles.”

“Maybe he was right,” I said. “Maybe miracles are just people who finally decide to stop pretending.”

We didn’t talk much after that. She came over later that night, and for a few brief hours, the world stopped spinning. Her hair smelled like rain, her hands trembled against mine. We didn’t speak about Almair or Sônia — just held onto each other as if the next sunrise could erase us.

When she kissed me, it wasn’t passion — it was rebellion.

And I let myself believe that maybe, just maybe, doing the right thing would still matter.

***
The kitchen light flickered like it was tired of trying.
I sat at the table, elbows on the wood, staring into the untouched cup of coffee. The city murmured outside  distant sirens, propaganda drones humming like flies, a voice somewhere on the radio still repeating the same headline:
“Leaked footage of the Association’s experimental program sparks outrage…”

I turned the radio off.

A door slammed down the hall. “You little bastard,” came my mother’s voice, rough as gravel and twice as loud. “You didn’t tell me the world was burning!”

I didn’t even look up. “Good morning to you too.”

Zula stormed in wearing a robe and combat boots — the kind of outfit that made her look half-retired, half-ready to kill someone. Cigarette hanging from her lips, hair a battlefield of gray and gold, she stared at me like I was the breaking news.

“You think I wouldn’t see that damn video? Huh?” She jabbed the cigarette toward me, smoke curling like punctuation. “You think your old mother’s too blind to know what kind of horror you’ve been doing for those shiny suits?”

I sighed. “I didn’t leak it, Ma.”

“That’s not what I’m asking!” She slammed her hand on the table, making the cup jump. “I’m asking if it’s true. If that’s what you’ve been doing in there. Burning kids from the inside out while those golden pricks clap their hands?”

Her voice cracked.
That was worse than the yelling.

I rubbed my face. “It’s true.”

She stared at me. No words this time. Just that look  the one she used to give when I came home from training covered in bruises and lies. A mix of fury and heartbreak.

Then she moved  slow, deliberate  pulled out the chair across from me and sat. The wood creaked under her.

“Drink,” she said, nodding at the coffee.

“I don’t want—”

“Drink, damn it.”

I did. Bitter. Burnt. Perfectly her.

She lit another cigarette, the lighter’s flame flashing against her eyes. “You remember when you were a kid, you told me you wanted to ‘fix the world’? You were what, ten? Eleven? You drew that stupid picture of you flying around in a silver cape, helping everyone? I laughed for days.”

“I remember,” I said quietly.

“Yeah,” she muttered. “And I remember thinking  gods help him, he’s too soft for this world.”

She leaned back, smoke twisting toward the ceiling. “But you proved me wrong, didn’t you? You went out there, got your little shiny badge, learned how to make people explode, and became a god. Congratulations, Zenos. You fixed the world so well it’s on fire now.”

Her voice trembled halfway through the sentence. She hid it behind another drag of smoke.

“Mom—”

“Don’t ‘Mom’ me.” She jabbed the air again. “You think I don’t know what it’s like, huh? To have power in your hands and people looking at you like you’re salvation? It eats you. Turns you into one of them.”

Her eyes softened for a second. “You’re not one of them, are you?”

“No,” I said. “At least, I don’t want to be.”

“Then stop acting like it,” she snapped. “Stop killing for them. Stop hiding behind fancy words like ‘evolution’ and ‘order.’ You’re my son. You’re supposed to have more spine than that.”

Her words hit like slaps, but they didn’t hurt — they anchored me.

“I’m trying,” I said. “I’m working with Sônia. We’re going to end this. But it’s dangerous. If Almair finds out—”

“He’ll kill you,” she interrupted bluntly. “Yeah, I know. He tried to kill me a dozen times  just never had the guts to finish the job.”

“Mom,” I said with a weak laugh. “You were retired.”

“I was too expensive,” she said with pride. “You think he can handle two of us in the same room? Please.”

Despite myself, I smiled. “You never change.”

“Good,” she said. “The world’s already got enough hypocrites. It doesn’t need me pretending to be one too.”

She stubbed out her cigarette, leaned forward, elbows on the table, and studied me. The light hit her face just right, showing every scar, every wrinkle carved by years of fighting battles that never got medals.

“You look tired,” she said softly.

“I am.”

“You sleeping at all?”

“Not really.”

She nodded. “You will, after this mess ends. Or you’ll be dead. Either way, you’ll finally rest.”

“Comforting,” I muttered.

She smirked. “I’m not in the comfort business, boy. I’m in the truth business.”

Silence settled between us. The kind that wasn’t empty — just heavy.
Outside, rain started to tap against the window.

After a moment, she said, quieter now, “You know why I’m angry?”

“Because I’m your son?”

“Because I love my son, idiot.” She exhaled through her nose, smoke curling out like a sigh. “And because I know what it’s like to lose yourself in the middle of something that looks noble. It’s a drug, Zenos. The moment you start believing you’re saving the world, you stop noticing who you’re killing for it.”

I stared at her this woman who’d never said I love you without an insult attached.

“I’m scared too, Ma,” I said softly. “I keep wondering if it’s too late to fix any of this.”

She reached across the table, grabbed my hand — firm, rough, motherly. “Then fix what’s in front of you first. One thing. One life. Don’t think about the world — it’s too damn big. Just don’t let it eat you.”

I swallowed hard, nodding.

She let go, stood, and opened the fridge. “Now eat something before I slap sense into you. You look like death and guilt had a baby.”

I couldn’t help it I laughed. The sound felt foreign, but real.

Zula smirked. “There he is. My idiot boy.”

When she turned her back, I looked down at the cup still half-full, still bitter.

1ojtcap,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ojtcap/the_hanged_mans_heir_part_1/,"The Hanged Man's Heir, Part 1","I remember vividly the precise moment in which I learned of my father's death. It was bitterly cold as the clock struck three in the morning, winter rain pounded mercilessly against the windows of the little apartment I shared with my best friend in the world, who had, without my knowing it, in an instant become the only person I had left in the world. Those misty panes of glass all around our small home rattled in the freezing wind that blew through town that night, carrying the icy rain with it as if searching for something, or someone. It was a mournful climate that had taken the city at that hour, the sky beating at the earth with wailing winds and raging rain. Perhaps the world itself had known before even I had learned of the events that had occurred mere hours before.

When my phone rang and faintly broke through the roaring downpour outside, waking me up with a sharp noise unlike the muffled rumble of the winter storm roaring through the night, I took a moment to let it ring so that I could determine who was calling me at three in the morning. There was no caller ID. I nearly let my head drop back onto my pillow, but I answered the call intending to give the person on the other end a piece of my mind if they turned out to be a scam-artist or some sort.

""Is this Lukas Woode speaking?"" a pleasant-sounding woman asked as soon as I had groggily mumbled a greeting. I had to turn my phone's volume up as far as it would go to hear her over the weather. Once I confirmed my identity, the woman spoke again, keeping a brisk and chipper tone despite the hour, though she sounded significantly less cold as she continued. ""I'm afraid I may have some bad news for you. Earlier this evening, a man was reported dead on the scene of a traffic accident, and we have since verified that that man was Markus Woode. Your name was the one he claimed as his next of kin. Do you know the man I'm speaking of?""

I don't remember what I said next, if I said anything at all. What I do remember is that the woman on the phone told me who it was that had called me, which was all I had really cared about at the time. I hung up the phone and dressed myself quickly, loudly, uncaring as to whether or not I woke my roommate and friend, Adam. I thundered out of the house in simple clothes that were soaked through quickly in the rain. I had no car to drive myself to the hospital, and neither did Adam, so I walked. Ran, more like it. The brutal rain and wind harassed me from all sides as if I alone was its target, but the deafening roar and numbing cold weren't the things that fogged up my mind, sapped all the warmth from my veins, froze my heart in my chest even as it hammered louder than any storm. To my mind, there was nothing that mattered except myself and the road, and my father at the end of it.

Fifteen minutes later, I crashed through the front entrance of the forensic medical centre, walking water and mud into the tile of the lobby. The woman at the desk spoke with the voice I had heard on the phone when we spoke. I could have been more polite to her, but I suppose she dealt with more than a few distressed people working where she did, and so she went to speak with one of the forensic examiners, a doctor that introduced himself with a name I did not care to commit to memory when we spoke some time later. The doctor escorted me through the halls of his workplace and brought me to the man they thought was my father. A fraction of my heart, a heart that was screaming at me from within my own head even though it sounded as distant as the rain that had soaked me to the bone in transit, still did not quite believe that my father really was dead. I didn't know what he was, if not, but I needed to see it to believe.

The room I was led to was dark, the overhead light only faintly illuminating the room even at such a time as three-thirty in the morning. That flickering bulb buzzed and hummed as it struggled to stay alight. The black tile of the floor drank in and swallowed that weak light, dull and lacking shine as my wet shoes squealed against them. The similarly dark walls made the small room appear to lack borders, as if I could have stepped off the tile and into black nothingness, a void that pushed in on my senses as I stepped closer to the middle of the room. A table stood in the middle of the black, morbid space, lengths and surfaces of silver that did gleam in the dying light from above, covered in a thin white sheet that conformed to a humanoid shape underneath. I approached the table and hovered above that shape, but hesitated to uncover it and see for myself.

The doctor did it for me. He brought the sheet down to expose the shape's head, and I was forced to grip the table so that I my knees did not buckle. My father and I had always looked alike. I had his nose, straight and narrow, though his had been broken a number of times, his pale skin and eyes, though his were far paler than I hoped mine would ever be as the pallor of death had washed over him, and his dark, thick hair, some of which was missing from his head along with fragments of his scalp. I gagged, and would have emptied my stomach if it had had anything in it. The ghostly image of my deceased father drove me to silent tears as I confirmed for the doctor that they had gotten the details of his identity correct.

A torrent of emotion tore at me until I had nothing left to give to that scouring rush of insane grief that left me feeling mad in its wake. It was about ten minutes later that I could stand without leaning on the table that supported the corpse that had once been a father to me mere hours ago, when I had been wrung out and robbed of all the emotion that I found it possible to express at three o'clock in the morning. It was only then, when my mind had been emptied of all preoccupation and I was utterly vacant, that my mind latched onto detail that was unfamiliar to me. The patches of his scalp that had been torn from his skull. The slash across his cheek. The burn that had left his ear a melted mass of skin and cartilage. I briefly wondered if it might have been a trick of the light, but my eyes caught on one thing in particular among my father's many small injuries.

Black stained his neck, covering his skin in long, flowing lines that streaked his flesh in the pattern of veins. I pulled the sheet down further to expose his shoulders, and the left shoulder bore the same pattern snaking down around the joint through the skin and further along his torso. I attempted to pull the sheet down even more to investigate more thoroughly, but the doctor stopped me with a hand on my wrist when I tried.

""I understand that you may be curious, but I am still conducting my examination,"" the doctor said with his imperious, cold manner of speaking. ""If you wish, I can send you the results of my examination, once it is done, but until then, I apologise, but there is no more that you can do to aid us in our work.""

I said nothing more except to apologise to the woman at the front desk on my way out for tracking dirt in upon my arrival, and left. On my way home, I walked through the rain again, but I wasn't concerned with getting sick or with the cold. What in the world could have done all of that to my dad's body? They had said that he'd died in a traffic accident, but anyone who knew my father would have known that that was nonsense. For one thing, my father had never driven a car in his life; we had lived in such a walkable city that neither of us had ever really needed to learn how. For another, he hadn't left his house in months after slowly transitioning into an early retirement from his job as a private investigator. He was only fifty-four, but his active lifestyle was catching up to him fast, so he had decided to check out early. What had he been doing out and about?

The real burning question was one I was almost afraid to even ask. What could have caused that strange black marking on his skin? That wasn't natural. My father hadn't had any skin conditions that I had known of, and it didn't look like scarring, so what? That was the thing that stuck with me as I stomped up the stairs of my apartment complex and clumsily dried my shoes before entering once again. I only stayed awake long enough to change out of my wet clothes and halfway dry my hair before I passed out in bed just as the clock struck four-thirty. It was indeed the the very early morning of the eighteenth of September, and even if my father might have died before midnight, I had only learned of it once the date had changed. What a wonderful twenty-seventh birthday gift.

When I woke up in the morning, I had a more in-depth conversation with the forensic medical examiner, and after that came to realise something that hadn't occurred to me before. As I was an only child and my mother passed many years ago, and my father hadn't remarried and had no living family at all other than myself — Magnus Woode had never been a family man — I was the sole inheritor of all his worldly possessions, as was later explained to me by the executor of my father's will, a lawyer he had saved from false accusations of malpractice back in the day, when he'd still been working as a PI.

Thus, I spent my birthday — which usually would have been spent with Adam getting so drunk that I could taste colours — combing through my father's house to mark what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to sell, since it was all mine now, including the house. My father had owned the place and, after I checked my bank that afternoon and realised that I'd inherited all the money he'd saved up over his long, lucrative career, it would be paid off for a long while if I didn't do anything stupid.

The house itself was an ancient place right in the heart of the city, hidden away between an office building and a sprawling manor that once had been the estate of a wealthy family before being renovated into a museum dedicated to the history and culture of the city. The outside of the place was narrow and tall, dark even as a bright, pale winter sun shone down on it with its sterile light, its aged wooden frame seeming to sway slightly in the breeze, or perhaps that was an optical illusion given the building's decrepit looks. I had only visited a few times since my father had bought the place, which had been when I had gone off to college almost ten years ago, so it was still mostly unfamiliar to me. Adam had volunteered to come along with me and help out with the sorting of things, but I turned him down. This was something I felt I had to do on my own.

The inside of the house was equally as dark and grimy. The house was so old that there were no overhead lights, so I had to take a quick trip to the store to buy flashlights; I wasn't about to waste my phone batteries, not when I was expecting more calls throughout the day. I went from room to room, exploring and marking everything that wasn't nailed down as something to sell or something to keep. I don't remember exactly what I had expected, but I was done by ten o'clock, and most of the work was able to be done in a sort of haze, going around and more or less absently judging everything that my father had owned for the last nine years of his life without expending much effort. My father had always been the kind of man to place little value on material possessions. A phone call with the executor of the will later confirmed that the entirety of the material collection I'd been left was indeed simply the house and everything in it, as little as that really was.

The mundanity and monotony of it lulled me into a state close to falling asleep on my feet, especially after seeing my father's body just hours before in the small hours of the morning, which had been such a shock to the system that my sleep after that point had been horrible and filled with horrible dreams I can still only half-remember. What brought me out of that state was discovering a door where I had never known there was one. The door was found right at the end of the long, narrow hallway that curved slightly to the right due to what I assumed was an error during the house's construction, which was shrouded in darkness even as I focused my flashlight on it from down the hall's meandering length. I walked down and opened the door, opening up a passageway I had never realised was there.

The door let out into a flight of stairs that curved and twisted around itself. The steps of the staircase moaned under my weight, and the frame of the twisting stairwell definitely swayed slightly as *I* descended the dusty corkscrew of steps. At the bottom, the stairs let out into a small basement that was even darker than upstairs had been due to the absence of windows and any sort of natural lighting. It was so dark that the beam of my flashlight seemed to dim slightly when I shone it into the room, as if the shadows in there were eating away at the brightness, or perhaps as if the light was fleeing the dark. The second I crossed the threshold into the room, goosebumps erupted all over my skin and I shivered in the cold that made all the hair on my body stand on end. I looked around vaguely, as if I would see anything outside the area my flashlight illuminated, which shrank the further I pushed into the room.

That basement must have been older than the rest of the house, given the rotted wooden beams holding up the ceiling, and the musty, stale air that made me cough and wheeze until I caught my breath. Dust swirled around my feet when I walked, and the floor was smooth, paved stone or hard packed earth, rather than wooden floorboards. There was nothing down there except for a decaying old stand made out of a dark wood that was glossy and shone like marble under the glow of my flashlight, and something that gleamed with a purity that was out of place in this disintegrating place, something that was placed atop the stand like a holy relic upon a pedestal. I approached it and shone my flashlight down onto it from above as I took a good look.

It was a book. The tome was thick, the yellowed pages within rested slightly unaligned with each other, giving it a homemade look. The covers were pitch black leather, matte and unreflective as it consumed the light I shone onto it. What did shine was the gilding on the front cover. It was silver leaf, gleaming and bright and pure, arranged in the shape of an eye that possessed a disquieting air of intellect, within a gilded noose that twisted around itself and closed in around the eye, whose pupil was a void of black leather at the very middle of the cover. The hair on my head stood on end, my usually messy, dark hair straightening out as it floated above my head when I moved to touch the book. Blood roared in my ears as my heart thudded in my chest, my limbs buzzes with energy as a charge filled the air around me, like electricity given form. My chest burned as I tried to breathe and couldn't suck in air. All these phenomena grew more sever the closer my hand came to touching the book.

What on earth was this thing, and why was it inducing such a reaction in me? I had no clue as to what I was provoking by doing this, but all of a sudden, my sleep-deprived and emotionally fatigued brain decided that this was the time for anger. This was my house now, this was my basement, and this was my book by association. I had lost more than I had really come to terms with just hours ago, and I was not in the mood for this. I owned all of this. That book was mine. I could touch it if I liked. And, with that, I did touch it.

The book was smooth to the touch, and had the feel of moisture even though the cover was as dry as everything else down in that basement. The silver gilding on the cover was cool, enough to sting slightly, and hard. The instant I pressed my hand down onto the cover of that book, thunder boomed overhead, the sound of the sky striking the earth, and the charge that had built in the air was released in a rush of air that was colder than I have words to describe. The foundations of the house shook, the rotted beams supporting the ceiling groaned, and the staircase wobbled. Distant, muffled impacts, rain landing upon the roof of the house in chaotic rhythm, drew my eyes upward. The load-bearing beams and boards that held the house up above my head creaked and groaned, and the floorboards of the ceiling — which was the living room's floor, if my memory of the house's layout was accurate — visibly flexed under their own weight.

I cradled the book in my arms and ran to the staircase just as another roaring crack of thunder rang out directly above the house, by the sounds of it. The foundations of the house trembled again, and the tearing of decayed wood filled my ears as the ceiling collapsed right behind me. I pulled myself up the staircase that churned and protested loudly, and flung myself up to the ground floor as fast as I could. When I stumbled out of the stairwell, I half-sprinted and half-staggered through the hall and out into the living room in a panicked daze. A thrill shot up my spine as I looked upon the destruction wrought by whatever it was that had just happened. The entire floor of the living room, which had supported a coffee table, a recliner, and a television, had caved in within a matter of seconds, and I laughed out loud as exhausted mania took me. I was having an insane day, and the only way I knew to stave off the despair and terror was to laugh.

Looking down at the book, I turned it over in my hands. The back cover was gilded in silver just like the front, but the image it made was vastly different. The image the back cover bore was that of a great tree with nine branches and three roots, all gnarled and twisted together to form a great clustered web of natural life. Upon the tree were perched three groups of three birds, each with one little eye, though what kind of bird I couldn't discern. There was a kind of hum to the book, like the charge from before but less intense, though it still gave me goosebumps. It pulsed in a rhythm, which was identical to the rhythm of the thunder roaring thousands of metres above my head. It was the rhythm of a heartbeat — *my* heartbeat. The charge of the book, the thunder shattering the sky above, the waves of rain soaking through the ancient wooden structure around me, it all came with the irregular heartbeat rhythm of my own fear.

An immense impact made me jump halfway out of my skin and yelp in shock and fear. That did *not* come with the tempo of my heartbeat. Neither did the sound of scattering, broken glass a second later. Making my way to the source of the sound, I discovered that a window in the kitchen had been shattered and the glass thrown across the floor around a bird that frantically flapped its wings for a moment before slowing and falling still. Blood began to pool around the dark bird, and its dead eyes fell on me in its final moment. It was a large, black bird with a gleaming beak and a shock of feathers around its neck that rose like a dog's hackles as it died; using my limited knowledge of avian species, I decided that it was a raven and not a crow.

Between crashes of thunder, this time accompanied by the flash of lightning outside that lit up the dark kitchen for less than a second, the croaking call of another raven drifted in from right outside the window. And then another. And another. And yet another. In a flash of blue-white lightning that cast deep shadows across the alley between my father's house and the office building beside it, I caught sight of black shapes circling around above the dark, gaunt building. Dozens of raven's calls were drowned out by the subsequent crash of thunder, louder than all the rest before it, as the house shook once again.

I hesitated for a moment to leave that house, a monument to my father, but my choice was made for me by the tidal wave of black feathers that pounded against every window of the house in an unrelenting surge of corvid suicide. The reverberating sound of glass shattering from every angle drove me to run, but I had hesitated too long. The ravens came for me while I was running through the main hall, diving and scratching at me, trying to catch me in the face with their razor-sharp claws and beaks. I screamed as my face erupted with scorching pain, and I tried to swat the ravens away from me using the weight of the book to bat them aside as I fled. The house shuddered in time with my quickening heartbeat as the thunder and lightning above surged, and the second I stepped outside with the book in hand, my vision was filled with blue-white light that came with a boom that took my hearing. My attackers disappeared as if struck down by the lightning.

Staggering onto the street and quickly becoming drenched by the driving rain that fell upon my at an angle propelled by the mournful winds that wailed as they blew, I turned back around and stared at what had become of the one material possession my father had bequeathed to me. From the very peak of the lonely, frail, ancient house, sparks flew and caught on the wooden panels making up its roof, upon which started a fire. Somehow, despite the rain and the wind and the cold, the wooden house all succumbed to flames, one wooden board catching and spreading it to the next, until black smoke began to waft into the air and sirens rang out from a distant street. Blinking rapidly so that my vision would properly clear up, I surveyed the small yard in front of the house to find dozens of shrivelled, black forms of a vaguely avian shape laid about as they let off a foul smoke that smelled of burning oil.

Panic took me then. Where did I go from there? What did I do with the book? What even was the book? Why had any of that happened the way it did? I had a hundred questions and no answers, so I tried to think of a course of action that I could take that would give me any semblance of comfort. My first thought was to get the book out of the rain so that I could have a chance to investigate it further at home once things calmed down. However, once I took a good look at it, I discovered that although I had become drenched from head to toe in the rain, the book had stayed perfectly dry. As I watched, the drops of water falling from above touched the book and seemed to slide around and off of it as I had seen from hydrophobic substances in high school science classes. The book was totally fine. Unfortunately, I was not, as the rain made the scratches and punctures on my face from the ravens' attacks sting even more.

I did not get all the time I would've liked to think about my next move. As storm clouds gathered overhead, winged shapes emerged from all around and began to circle around the flaming ruins of my father's old house and croak at my from the air. My feet pounded against the hard sidewalk as I sprinted away down the street, clutching the book close to my chest and pushing my tired body to move as fast as it could, which was not amazingly fast even at the best of times. This was decidedly not the best of times. I slipped and slid along the slick pavement as I ducked and dodged under attacks from ravens that tried to claw or peck my eyes out. One got my eyebrow, which stung so much that I actually shouted out in pain as its nasty little claws broke the skin in three shallow lines just above my eye, but no damage was done, so I pushed on.

The walk home was too far to make it on foot while being pursued by a whole flock of ravens. Did you know that the collective noun for a group of ravens is called an *unkindness*? I had away blown that little tid-bit off as a joke told by kids who wanted to sound smarter than they really were, but as I ran what felt like the length of a city while under attack from bloodthirsty corvids, I began to understand why they were called that. I needed a place to hide, and I needed it quickly. My only problem was that I didn't know any nearby shelters. I scrambled to maintain my footing on the slippery sidewalk as I pivoted on the spot into an alley and managed to shake off the murderous birds for only a few moments before their airborne agility allowed them to easily catch back up with me.

There was one idea that I could try, but I had no idea whether or not it would've worked, and what I needed in my life right then and there was just a little bit of certainty. I decided to take the risk anyway. There was no other choice; it was the closest place I could think of.

The church came into view as I turned a corner and smacked one of the ravens so hard that a sound like crunching paper came from its body as it tumbled toward the ground and went still. I had managed to outrun the storm that had started over my father's home; the dark, flashing clouds gathered above me had in fact been centred on the house, and not on me, or the book. I had no idea how the book was relevant, but I was sure it was. I didn't slow down as I crossed the street, and I may have even sped up a little bit as my goal drew closer with every step. Narrowly dodging a car or two didn't slow me down either as I slammed into the massive double doors of the haunting, pale building that stabbed up at the darkening sky with spires and towers that seemed fit for a castle. The dark wooden doors opened when I pushed hard on them, and I all but fell inside before scrambling to my feet and leaving the book on the marble floor to slam the doors shut behind me and lock the ravens outside.

I leaned against the door and slid down to sit with my back against the cold, hard wooden barrier between myself and the flock of ravens outside. My shoes slipped and screeched on the smooth floor of the church as a puddle of rain water gathered beneath me. As that puddle grew out from the floor beneath me as my soaked clothes dripped onto the marble, the swell of water warped itself around the book that I had dropped on the floor, the puddle grew *around* the book so that the tome would not get wet. Before, I had thought the book was simply waterproof, and so I'd had the ability to ignore it. As I sat and stared at the book, watching as the water flowed out from under me in every direction and flowed *around* the book and *only* the book, my theory that the book was somehow relevant to everything that had happened at the house started to solidify as fact in my mind.

A booming, drawling voice — it wasn't deep, but it did hold a resonance that helped it carry — rang out in the silence that had blanketed the inside of the church since my arrival. ""It seems the Lord has sent us a guest.""

Looking around, I don't know what I had expected, but the church looked unlike anything I had anticipated. The first thing that surprised me was that it was occupied. The central nave lined with pews was packed with dozens of people of all ages, some of which clustered together as the younger ones shied away from my dishevelled self as if sheltering family from a danger. Those dozens upon dozens of people were lit up by rays of multicoloured light, beams filtered through the stained glass that warped the sunlight that hit them; the storm had not yet reached this place. At the far end of the hall, the sanctuary with its altar loomed above and apart from those who had gathered together in prayer before my entrance. The lectern upon the altar held a Bible that laid open as a lector stared at me from all the way across the church. Behind that lector, the massive crucifix bearing the depiction of Jesus Christ towered over everyone, and Christ seemed to stare down at me in particular. It made me feel small and vulnerable despite my victory over the ravens.

""Sorry, everyone,"" I stammered. I stood and clutched the book to my chest since I didn't have to worry about it getting wet. ""Didn't mean to interrupt, I promise, I just needed to … get out of the rain."" I gestured vaguely to my drenched self and hoped they wouldn't ask me to elaborate and come up with a lie.

""That's alright, friend,"" the lector said, holding his arms out in what looked like an attempt to calm the congregation. ""We are welcoming of all who seek shelter from misfortune.""

A small shape passed over one of the stained glass windows, fluttering by and casting a long shadow over the pews before it was gone in an instant. I stared at the window as the relief that had washed over me dried up just as fast as that shape moved. Shifting on my feet brought another squealing whine from my soaked shoes, and made me wince. I went and sat on one of the pews closest to the entrance that was empty; I didn't want to bother anyone with a puddle. My wet clothes made too much sound for my liking when I moved, and the staring didn't bring me any more comfort. If it was a miracle that I hadn't gotten sick after exposing myself to the elements last night, I was tempting fate doing it again just seven or so hours later.

The lector continued his speaking when I was seated. ""For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: So man lieth down, and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.""

Two minutes could have passed as I sat and listened, or perhaps two hours. The lector's words were eventually drowned out in my mind, and perhaps my mind only, by the low, raspy croak of a calling raven that just barely penetrated through the closed windows. I stared at the window that had briefly been thrown into shadow by a passing shape in the air. That distant call made my blood run cold, and my hands tightened around the book as I peered down at it and was tempted to finally look inside. Before I could look, though, I flinched as an impact rattled one of the stained glass windows with an immense BANG. The congregation stared as a black shape fell from the window, causing shadows to shift along them, and I stood when I realised what was happening.

The lector said, ""Well, that was certainly surprising,"" in what must have been an attempt to soothe the people, but they began to murmur among themselves anxiously. Another impact, this time on the other side of the building, slammed against the stained glass and caused another fright among the churchgoers. A third raven flattened itself against another window, and another, and another, until the stained glass began to crack and chip. My entire body throbbed in time with the pulse of the book, in time with the impacts hammering at the windows. Over the panicking congregation, I met the lector's eyes, and his face tightened as his faze fell on me and shifted down to the book that, despite its pulsing charge, was still as cold as it had ever been. I began to understand that none of my body heat transferred to the thick tome despite the length of time that I had held it in my hands.

A surge of black feathers broke through the stained glass, dark raven's blood splattering across the congregation's faces and backs as they flinched away from the scattering glass that sent flashes of every colour imaginable across the church. The waves of black poured into the building like a liquid and flowed through the air, but not toward me, even as I staggered back and fell over as I tipped over the pew. The flock of ravens filled the air above the pews and altar, and the lector shouted, ""Please stay calm, friends! You may evacuate through the front doors!"" The congregation all moved as one mass, flooding the aisle between the rows of pews and sprinting forth to escape the black-winged invasion of their holy place.

The ravens dove, but not at any person. They swarmed around the crucifix, the depiction of Jesus Christ, croaking and crying their sickening calls as they assaulted the symbol of divinity looming over me. The dark attackers clawed the son of God's eyes out, and scratched at his hands and feet, and pecked holes into his sides. Stigmata, the legendary, Biblical wounds suffered by Christ, had been inflicted upon his image once again. I had never been a devout man, my mother had not raised me to believe in any one thing and now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know what my father believed. That no longer mattered. A terror like none I had ever experienced before, dread colder than the worst winter and panic hotter than even the sun, streaked through me in a lightning strike of fear.

That lector, I regret never learning his name, gathered up a broom and attempted to dissuade the ravens from attacking the symbol of his faith, and paid the price. The few birds he managed to strike with the length of his broom swerved in the air and dove at him, and the arms he threw up to defend himself were not enough. I started forward for a few steps before freezing abruptly as goosebumps erupted along my arms at the sight of what those foul corvids did to that poor man. Nausea threatens to rob me of the contents of my stomach even thinking about it now. By the end of it, the lector who had welcomed me into his place of worship was an eyeless mess of blood running down his face, which was frozen in the terror that had taken him in his final moments; his hands were pierced right through the palms, and his shoes had been torn apart and the soles of his feet had been punched through as well. The sides of his torso had been penetrated by those razor beaks and forced wide enough for his innards to spill out onto the altar he collapsed upon.

The lector screamed as he writhed in pain from suffering through the wounds as his lord had two thousand years ago, through which that lord's depiction had been destroyed anew just moments ago, as I would be destroyed if I stayed. With tears in my eyes — I had never seen a person die before — I turned and ran out the doors with everyone else. The sunlight outside blinded me for a moment, just long enough for me to run head-first into a person and stagger back with an apology. As my eyes adjusted, I kept on running, my frantic eyes scanning everything around me in my panic. A hundred ravens or more circled above the church as the ones inside defaced the image of Christ and ate away at the lector. The pulsing of the book beat in time with the rhythm of my sprint down the street toward home. The fatigue of sleep-deprivation and bodily exhaustion was beginning to catch up with me, and my staggering gait was slow and sluggish, but enough to take me away from the ravens, who for some foul reason seemed more interested in the church than myself. For now.

The black, oily smoke pouring into the sky in a thin, faint plume was distant and faded by that time, but I could pinpoint my position in the city relative to my father's old house using it as a north star. Firefighters must have arrived to the scene and tamed the blaze by now, but there was no way that I was going to go back there. Home. That was the only place I had left. That would, however, put Adam, the only *person* I had left, in danger if the ravens followed me there. My mind screamed questions at me as my body simply moved without conscious input. Where to go? What to do? Who to trust with this? What even was this? Why was this happening to me? Was it the book? How was my father connected to this? Why now? I had no answers for any of it. There was one thing I knew for certain, though; I needed rest, and to rest, I needed to go home.

As soon as I exploded into our shared apartment, Adam, who'd been sitting on the couch watching a movie, shouted in outrage. He went to say something if the look in his eye as I violently locked the front door told me anything, but he seemed to realise something at the last second and abandoned his complaint. ""Why are you drenched?"" he asked as I marched across our living room.

""I'll explain,"" I promised as I gently laid the black-and-silver book, the ancient tome that was my only real material inheritance from my father, on the coffee table. ""First, help me make sure all the windows are closed.""

Adam stared at me like I was crazy. I certainly *felt* crazy. ""Why?""

""Just do it!"" I roared, and I must have looked even crazier for it, because he immediately complied.

As we went around our apartment and ensured that all the windows were shut and locked where that was possible, I calmed down a little bit. The ravens could have broken the glass if they had really wanted to get in, but that was what I could do in the moment to secure our home against the corvid stalkers, and it helped me feel better. After that, I collapsed onto the sofa despite Adam's complaints about my half-dry clothes and breathlessly told him the story of my day so far. He seemed to think I was joking when I told of what had happened at my father's old house, but when I told of what had occurred at the church and we moments later heard sirens racing down the street outside in the direction of said church, Adam's face paled and he began pacing nervously.

""Assuming I believe you,"" he said with a incredulous scoff, ""what do we even do now?""

""I don't know,"" I said hoarsely. My voice was totally drained of emotion after all I'd been through during the nine hours since learning of my father's death at three o'clock that morning. My eyes never left the book as I talked, its cover of leathery midnight and its gilding of heavenly silver, arranged in that image of the eye within the loop of a noose. What in the world *was* it? ""I don't know."" I spoke more to myself than to Adam then.

I really did not know anything. About the book, about what had happened that day, and about my father, if his house was where all this had begun. It was becoming clear to me as the day went on that I may not have really known my father. That had always been obvious, we'd never been close because of his work; his investigative career had taken him across the country, everywhere except home, where my mother had fulfilled his true duty for him before her unexpected death over a decade ago. Why had my father had this book in his basement? Because I was sure the book had somehow *caused* everything with the storm and the ravens and the basement collapsing in on itself, how had it done that? What had those dark markings on my father's pale, dead flesh been?

I knew nothing. I didn't intend to stay ignorant, though. Looking up at Adam, the book between us on the table as I sat and he paced, I caught his attention with a sigh and asked him the question that changed our lives forever, and not for the better. I wish I hadn't, but I did. Because I did, what happened after that between us was and continues to be my fault. I acknowledge that now. However, in that moment, none of that mattered. I simply wanted a friend by my side as I navigated this frightening, unbelievable, insane time in my life. I didn't have my father to rely on anymore — if I ever had in the first place — and Adam was the only person in the world that I could trust with this. So I asked him. I asked, and doomed us both to what would come next.

The rooms his characters leave behind.

The choices they never make.

The echo that lingers when the screen fades to black.

A train of thought on what was there – and what could have been. Not much news here, and definitely no gossip (as if there were much to gossip about, anyway).

It’s mythology, maybe.

Chapter 1 

From the very beginning of our relationship. I knew my husband had a strange disorder. He just couldn’t read emotions 

rd flash him a beaming smile, and he’d ask in all seriousness “Are your facial muscles cramping? 

When I cried out of frustration, he calmly handed me a tissue. “Did your fake lash fall into your eye? Or was it the wind? 

Seven years of marriage, and I tried everything 

I made an emotion cheat sheet out of my own selfies. Acted like a full-blown emotional narrator in front of him 

I took his hand and placed it on my face, guiding him through the curve of a smile, the trail of tears, trying to teach him 

joy and pain by feel 

But in the end, he still couldn’t tell a single one of my emotions apart. 

Until that day, when I found an old notebook in his safe. 

On the inside cover was a photo of his first love. Underneath there were densely packed notes. 

\[Left brow raised by one millimeter. lips tightly pressed genuinely angry, apologize immediately! 

 

Eyes slightly narrowed, nose barely wrinkled holding back laughter, thinks I’m onte\] 

 

\[Gaze downward right hand grabbing shirt hem sad needs a bug\] 

In that moment, everything I had held onto for seven years shattered. 

Later, when I threw a glass in front of him and he asked if I’d just lost my grip. I swing my purse at his head. “Can you 

tell now? I’m mad 

David Vance looked stunned as I hit him over and over until he finally snapped out of it and grabbed my arm. Tila are 

you just stressed from work lately?” 

His voice was as calm as ever. I felt completely drained. 

Seven years, and no matter how I broke down or cried with joy, to him, it was all some emotionless silent film 

Even now, when I had clearly exploded in anger, throwing something at his head he still stood there like an outsider. 

coolly analyzing the situation. 

I gave up. The bag dropped from my hand and hit the floor with a thud 

But when I looked up. I froze. 

David’s eyebrows were slightly raised, and his lips were pressed tight. 

Exactly how the notebook had described someone who was angry. 

My voice trembled “Are you mad?” 

 

His face immediately went blank again. “No.” 

I let out a laugh, but tears welled up anyway. “You’re lying. Your eyebrows, your mouth…” 

I stared at him, heart pounding. “David, I saw your notebook. The one with her photo.” 

His expression finally changed. For the first time, those calm, emotionless eyes were shaken. 

“You touched my safe?” he asked. “Where is the notebook? Did you damage it?” 

He grabbed me so hard I stumbled, but I held my head high. “You tracked every twitch of her eyebrows and curve of her 

lips. But what about me?” 

I stared at him, my voice cracking. “I cried until I was dehydrated, and you thought my eyes were dry from the wind. I 

smiled until my face hurt, and you thought I was having muscle spasms.” 

“David, what the hell have these past seven years meant to you?” 

He didn’t even try to explain. He shoved me aside. 

I lost my balance and hit my elbow hard on the edge of the coffee table. Pain shot through me instantly. 

He didn’t even glance back. He just stormed into the study. 

A few minutes later, he came out clutching the yellowed notebook. 

His face had softened slightly. “You’re lucky it’s still intact. Don’t touch my stuff again.” 

At the door, he paused like he’d just remembered something. “By the way, your temper’s been getting worse lately. Tell 

the housekeeper to make some supplements tonight. It’ll help cool you off.” 

The door closed gently behind him. 

I sat there on the floor, staring at the blood welling up from my elbow. 

Seven years. All I could think was what a joke I’d become. 

The first time he ever managed to recognize one of my emotions… it was only because I touched something that 

belonged to his first love. 

That afternoon, I grabbed the supplementary credit card he’d given me and went straight to the mall. 

If I couldn’t get love, I could at least numb myself with money. 

After trying on outfit after outfit, I finally settled on a champagne-colored silk gown. 

The sales associate was about to bag it when a gentle voice interrupted, “Wait, I really like that dress too.” 

I turned around at the sound and locked eyes with a woman smiling softly. I recognized her immediately. 

She was the woman from the photo. Arden Lowe, David’s first love. 

 

I forced myself to stay composed. “Sorry, I saw it first.” 

Just then, a familiar figure walked over. 

David had a cup of boba tea in hand and casually handed it to Arden. “I noticed you kept licking your lips. Thought you 

must be thirsty.” 

My heart clenched like someone had ripped it apart. 

She didn’t even need to say anything, and he could read her needs so easily. 

But no matter how clearly I voiced mine, he’d only give me that confused, clueless look. 

He finally noticed me and blinked. “Lila? What are you doing here?” 

He glanced at Arden, then quickly added, “She’s an old classmate. Just got back into town. Don’t overthink it.” 

I ignored him and turned to the sales associate. “Wrap it up.” 

“Wait, Arden said softly, gazing up at David. “I really, really love that dress…” 

Without hesitation, David turned to me. “Give it to Arden. She really likes it.” 

I clenched my jaw. “You can’t tell I like it too?” 

He looked away without saying a word. 

In the heavy silence that followed, Arden giggled behind her hand. “David, remember how I used to tell you pretending 

not to understand women would save you a lot of trouble? Can’t believe you actually listened.”

I (F(23) have this close friend (F(23) na lagi kong pinagkwekwentuhan ng mga nangyayari sakin. We have been friends ever since first year college, graduating na kami btw. Eto kasing friend ko na to, magmula pa first year college, she has been getting into fubu set ups na. Reason? Wala daw kasing nagpupursue sa kanya. NBSB si ateng. Wala pang nagiging jowa, at according to her, wala din ever nanligaw. She considers herself as unattractive. It has always been her insecurity. No matter how much I try to hype her up, talagang she is convinced na panget siya.

Context:
So recently kasi, I broke up with my toxic ex na cheater. I think 6 months ago. And then after 3 months naman, nagtry ako magdating app (tinder). So, nakailang dates din ako. I think apat? Name it, mall dates, coffee date, cinema dates, binondo food crawl, museum dates, may nag aya sakin. More pa sana, kaso naguninstall na ako ng app kasi nakakadrain din. But it was a fun experience for me. Ok naman yung mga nakadate ko. They were all nice. This friend of mine, alam niya lahat ng nangyayari sakin, kasi talagang super comfy ako sa kanya na magshare. She actually tried na magdating app din, eh kaso walang nangyari. So nasad naman ako kasi gusto ko syempre happy din siya. 

So fastforward, eventually I met this guy and I agreed to enter into a fubu set up with him. I dunno. I just felt safe with the guy, kaya ako pumayag. Don't get me wrong guys ha, he is my first ever fubu. Wala naman talaga akong balak na pumasok sa ganitong set up nung una, kaya nga lahat ng mga nag aya before, talagang tinanggihan ko. Sa kanya lang ako napapayag. And so far, mag 4 months na kami dito sa set up, no regrets pa naman hahahah. I guess medyo magaling ako kumilatis ng tao. He is really nice. Hindi siya yung tipong booty calls lang. He updates me everyday, reassuring din si koya. And he is game to do nonsexual activities with me. Di lang puro sex. So I really, appreciate this guy kasi nga, hindi siya kupal sakin and is treating me the way that I deserve to be treated kahit pa casual lang yung set up HAHAHAHA. 

One time, nabanggit sakin ng friend ko na to na may inggit pala siya sakin. Di niya naelaborate pero probably because, I found a decent fubu at my first attempt. Siya kasi puro red flags yung mga naging fubu niya. It's either broke, booty callers, ghosters, may jowa pala, name it, lahat na ata ng red flags naencounter niya. 

I happen to come across her reddit account, diko na sasabihin kung pano, basta may nabasa akong post niya don, wherein she confessed na may inggit siya sakin kasi pakiramdam niya it's so easy for me daw na makakuha ng lalake kahit masasabing average lang ang ganda ko. I honestly felt hurt and offended kasi although aware naman po ako na hindi dyosa level ang ganda ko, still, sa isang kaibigan kasi galing. Diko lang siguro inexpect na ganun iniisip niya about me. I mean what right do you have na maglagay ng labels sa itsura ng tao. 

Lately, kaya pala nararamdaman ko na there has been a shift in her energy. Like dati, she used to be so supportive. Tuwing nagkwekwento ako about my dates, and mga ganap namin ni fubu, as in hype kung hype talaga siya. She always sounds so excited and enthusiastic. Ramdam na ramdam kong masaya siya sa mga magandang nangyayari sakin. Pero recently, ayun nga, nagbago na. Tuwing nagkwekwento ako, ang nonchalant at ang bland na ng mga sagutan niya. Alam niyo yung mga conversation ender na tipo ng sagot. Kung dati, her first response is to always support me and be happy for me, Ngayon her first response is to always compare herself and her experiences to me. Which honestly feels invalidating. Kesyo, eh kung ako yan diko gagawin yan ganito ganyan. 

Diko alam kung aware siya ha. Pero minsan yung tono ng pananalita niya nagiiba. Like nagtutunog condescending. Nagtutunog sarcastic. Alam niyo yung tipong nababara niya ako, diko alam kung sadya ba niya yun or di niya namamalayan at nacocontrol. Madalas kasi pag nagkwekwento ako, tapos yung response niya would make me feel so uncomfortable kasi nga parang may something, so medyo sisitahin ko siya kasi nga diko nagugustuhan yung sinasabi niya, tapos magrereply siya sarcastically na kesyo ano daw ba gusto kong ireact niya. Ano gusto kong ireact mo te? Be a friend. Act like one. Yun lang naman yun eh. 

Previous Attempts:
Ang ginagawa ko ngayon, medyo binabawasan ko yung pagaaya sa kanya sa kung saan saan. Kasi nga, pag nagsama kami, matic mapapakwento ako. Eh iba na pala naiisip niya. So medyo I'm keeping my distance. Tapos pag diko siya inaaya, di din talaga niya ako aayain somewhere, na para bang iniiwasan ako. Ang sad kasi di ganito yung gusto kong kahihinatnan ng friendship. She is like a sister to me. I love her as a friend. I feel like, kung walang inggit, this friendship could possibly last. Kaya nakakapanghinayang if hindi mamemaintain just because she can't seem to control her insecurities anymore. Halos di na nga ako nagkwekwento. Ang hirap. It's like tiptoeing. It's like walking on eggshells around the person.",1,1761809188.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

From the very beginning of our relationship. I knew my husband had a strange disorder. He just couldn’t read emotions 

rd flash him a beaming smile, and he’d ask in all seriousness “Are your facial muscles cramping? 

When I cried out of frustration, he calmly handed me a tissue. “Did your fake lash fall into your eye? Or was it the wind? 

Seven years of marriage, and I tried everything 

I made an emotion cheat sheet out of my own selfies. Acted like a full-blown emotional narrator in front of him 

I took his hand and placed it on my face, guiding him through the curve of a smile, the trail of tears, trying to teach him 

joy and pain by feel 

But in the end, he still couldn’t tell a single one of my emotions apart. 

Until that day, when I found an old notebook in his safe. 

On the inside cover was a photo of his first love. Underneath there were densely packed notes. 

\[Left brow raised by one millimeter. lips tightly pressed genuinely angry, apologize immediately! 

 

Eyes slightly narrowed, nose barely wrinkled holding back laughter, thinks I’m onte\] 

 

\[Gaze downward right hand grabbing shirt hem sad needs a bug\] 

In that moment, everything I had held onto for seven years shattered. 

Later, when I threw a glass in front of him and he asked if I’d just lost my grip. I swing my purse at his head. “Can you 

tell now? I’m mad 

David Vance looked stunned as I hit him over and over until he finally snapped out of it and grabbed my arm. Tila are 

you just stressed from work lately?” 

His voice was as calm as ever. I felt completely drained. 

Seven years, and no matter how I broke down or cried with joy, to him, it was all some emotionless silent film 

Even now, when I had clearly exploded in anger, throwing something at his head he still stood there like an outsider. 

coolly analyzing the situation. 

I gave up. The bag dropped from my hand and hit the floor with a thud 

But when I looked up. I froze. 

David’s eyebrows were slightly raised, and his lips were pressed tight. 

Exactly how the notebook had described someone who was angry. 

My voice trembled “Are you mad?” 

 

His face immediately went blank again. “No.” 

I let out a laugh, but tears welled up anyway. “You’re lying. Your eyebrows, your mouth…” 

I stared at him, heart pounding. “David, I saw your notebook. The one with her photo.” 

His expression finally changed. For the first time, those calm, emotionless eyes were shaken. 

“You touched my safe?” he asked. “Where is the notebook? Did you damage it?” 

He grabbed me so hard I stumbled, but I held my head high. “You tracked every twitch of her eyebrows and curve of her 

lips. But what about me?” 

I stared at him, my voice cracking. “I cried until I was dehydrated, and you thought my eyes were dry from the wind. I 

smiled until my face hurt, and you thought I was having muscle spasms.” 

“David, what the hell have these past seven years meant to you?” 

He didn’t even try to explain. He shoved me aside. 

I lost my balance and hit my elbow hard on the edge of the coffee table. Pain shot through me instantly. 

He didn’t even glance back. He just stormed into the study. 

A few minutes later, he came out clutching the yellowed notebook. 

His face had softened slightly. “You’re lucky it’s still intact. Don’t touch my stuff again.” 

At the door, he paused like he’d just remembered something. “By the way, your temper’s been getting worse lately. Tell 

the housekeeper to make some supplements tonight. It’ll help cool you off.” 

The door closed gently behind him. 

I sat there on the floor, staring at the blood welling up from my elbow. 

Seven years. All I could think was what a joke I’d become. 

The first time he ever managed to recognize one of my emotions… it was only because I touched something that 

belonged to his first love. 

That afternoon, I grabbed the supplementary credit card he’d given me and went straight to the mall. 

If I couldn’t get love, I could at least numb myself with money. 

After trying on outfit after outfit, I finally settled on a champagne-colored silk gown. 

The sales associate was about to bag it when a gentle voice interrupted, “Wait, I really like that dress too.” 

I turned around at the sound and locked eyes with a woman smiling softly. I recognized her immediately. 

She was the woman from the photo. Arden Lowe, David’s first love. 

 

I forced myself to stay composed. “Sorry, I saw it first.” 

Just then, a familiar figure walked over. 

David had a cup of boba tea in hand and casually handed it to Arden. “I noticed you kept licking your lips. Thought you 

must be thirsty.” 

My heart clenched like someone had ripped it apart. 

She didn’t even need to say anything, and he could read her needs so easily. 

But no matter how clearly I voiced mine, he’d only give me that confused, clueless look. 

He finally noticed me and blinked. “Lila? What are you doing here?” 

He glanced at Arden, then quickly added, “She’s an old classmate. Just got back into town. Don’t overthink it.” 

I ignored him and turned to the sales associate. “Wrap it up.” 

“Wait, Arden said softly, gazing up at David. “I really, really love that dress…” 

Without hesitation, David turned to me. “Give it to Arden. She really likes it.” 

I clenched my jaw. “You can’t tell I like it too?” 

He looked away without saying a word. 

In the heavy silence that followed, Arden giggled behind her hand. “David, remember how I used to tell you pretending 

not to understand women would save you a lot of trouble? Can’t believe you actually listened.”

1ojt7b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ojt7b1/regretting_being_in_special_forces/,Regretting being in special forces,"

So this year I finished my special forces training in the police. I'm currently in the squad but of course there still called a newbie, which is in general no problem.
But what really drives me crazy is the kind of policy they have. So every newbie  has to make coffee everyday, clean the group room wash the dishes etc. It May already sound kind of disrespectful but honestly I have no problem with that.
What's really insane is the interpersonal relationship. So last time I've had a night watch, which always has to be provided by one of us. During that some of the squad were throwing a big party. I was just trying to sleep an ignore it. Then someone called me and I didn't pick up immediately. He knocked then on the door and asked me aggressively why I don't pick up the phone during my watch. I said I just did but wasn't quick enough. He didn't respond just said, drive me to the other party now you newbie. Once we arrived there he said, no wait, take care of my hat and pick me up once I got some whores. Luckily they came back after 2 minutes cause the party was dead. After that someone came again to my room, kicked away my boots and told me he needs a breathalyzer to check if he can still drive home. 
Next event. I've been sick for 2 days then I came back to work. No one shaked my hand or asked how I'm doing. They were just working on a shared room. One of the guys looked at me and laughed: "" Ah so you feel like you want to work again. Go pick up some stuff and make yourself useful"" on that day I had to go to court so I explained that and walked off. 
Last incident. Once we were doing a bbq. And I was eating my steak at the table. Then I looked around and was looking for the other newbie. He was still standing next to the bbq. I went to him and asked what's up and why he's not joining us. He replied then he's not allowed to eat before everybody else is done.
I mean there are some nice people there. But everybody knows about that and I believe someone who's just watching this and doesn't do anything is no where better that the one actively disrespecting others. And the biggest thing, I mean we're still the police and maybe it's idealistic. But I wanted to help people and be a good person. Not some scumbag. 

Does anyone have similar experiences or what just in general you guys think? ",2,1761808960.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

we both have access to each others social media, everything. so i happened to see the email of flight change on his email. IDK why he didn’t log me out. when i’m trying surprise him i usually log him out of anything where there might be evidence.

i told him instantly, and he said i shouldn’t have looked or that i should have at least pretended i didn’t know to see what he was gonna do. he’s not mad at all, or upset with me. but i’m SO SO SO upset for ruining that surprise of his and also taking away what would have been such an amazing moment for both of us. 

there is no way i would have ever guessed he was going to surprise me if i hadn’t seen the email. i also feel bad for telling him, i should have kept it to myself. im just hardwired to share everything with him.

I would also  like to get suggestions for places in the vicinity of Exeter, but no more than a 30 minute drive. Curious to hear what everyone else has discovered, that one obscure place that is amazing.

My current favourites in and around Exeter (not exhaustive by any means):

Seafood: River Exe Cafe (some of the best seafood I've had), The Anchor Inn, and the Hourglass which surprisingly has a very good seafood menu (mussels with Devon cider was amazing).

BBQ: BFK @ Hanlons Brewery

Small Plates: Arcadia extremely affordable and delicious food menu which they refer to as small plates but I think  the portions are quite large. Excellent beers as well.

Indian: Everest in St. Thomas for North Indian (there is a delicious goat and lamb curry (on the bone) on their menu) and Namaste for South Indian.

Chinese: Beijing Beijing and JinLi (the latter can be a hit and miss)

Korean: Real Korea and Oh My Kimchi. I think I slightly prefer Real Korea, which has now opened a proper restaurant in the centre, as they are better bang for your buck.

Thai: Somboon Thai Shop (unfortunately only open for lunch), Just Thai and Kinkhao 

Fancy + tasting menu: Stage, I think I can not get over how good this restaurant continues to be and I wish we had more options like this in town.  Another one that is good but not at the same level: @ thirty-four

Cozy wine pairing with comfort food: Smith's Wine and Spirits (you ned to pre-arrange this with him)

Turkish: Istanbul (which has a great vibe and delicious food)

Cocktail Bars: Crocketts and Darwin's Bar. Wish we had more of these in town as well.

Miscellaneous shout outs: Tabac for a quick afterwork pint,  Bar at the Phoenix for movies and pints,  Luna Cafe, Pink Ginger Cafe and the new coffee shop in the Cathedral which is gorgeous.

Usual, well discussed spots for pints and/or food: Topsham B, Fat Pig, LDOP,  Cuckoo

List of places I have yet to try and looking for reviews from anyone who has tried them

2. Offer a set amount that people can pay into a kitty that is used for free meals to be given to anyone, adults or kids, like Heretic Coffee in Portland

3. People who present their SNAP card are eligible for meals. Some restaurants are saying once a week per adult with a SNAP card, but this would depend on your bottom line and if you are taking in money to prepay meals or not

4. Look into making sure you get tax credit if you are Gifting meals, this won't work if you're taking payment for meals via donations(so to speak) 

5. People want to help and this is a smaller version on World Central Kitchen so if you really want to know more about this type of giving look into Chef Andres nonprofit.

I’m talking thousands of MP3s, eating up every byte of free space. And there I was, staring at my disk usage, wondering how on earth I was supposed to manage it all. Enter the magical, mysterious world of how to compress MP3 files.

At first, I thought it would be as simple as dragging my files into some random app and hitting “compress.” Wrong. The first ten tools I tried either ruined the audio quality, added weird metadata, or just plain crashed. It’s almost like compressing MP3s is a rite of passage for digital hoarders. But after enough trial, error, and profanity, I finally figured out a workflow that works reliably - and yes, it actually keeps your music sounding decent.

Alright, let’s cut the crap about how to compress MP3 - this isn’t some magic button that zaps your files smaller without consequences. MP3 compression is basically about messing with the bitrate, tweaking the sampling rate, or re-encoding the track. Push it too far and suddenly your favorite song goes from “fire” to “sounds like it’s playing from a tin can at the bottom of the ocean.”

For casual listening, I stick to 128–192 kbps - small enough to save space but still decent for your ears. Going for perfect audiophile quality? Crank it to 256–320 kbps, but brace yourself: the files are gonna be bigger. At the end of the day, compressing MP3s is a juggling act - tiny files or good sound, you usually can’t have both.

Here’s my approach after testing a bunch of methods:

**Choose the right tool** – There’s no shortage of MP3 compressors. I lean on Audacity: it’s free, reliable, and works on any platform. Just drag in your track, pick a lower bitrate, export, and done. It’s simple and dependable.

**Batch it** – Compressing one song at a time is a nightmare. Most compressors, Audacity included, support batch processing. Drop in a whole folder, set your parameters, and let it run while you grab a coffee.

**Listen before you commit** – Always preview a few files after compression. Even “safe” settings can wreak havoc on songs with heavy bass or layered instruments.

**Keep backups** – Don’t skip this. Nothing stings worse than accidentally overwriting your originals with tiny, distorted MP3s.

# My Personal Tips & Tricks Just For You, Reddit Fellows

* Stick to CBR (constant bitrate) if you want predictable file sizes. VBR (variable bitrate) is sometimes more efficient, but it can confuse certain older players.
* Trim silence or unused audio before compressing. Every second counts if you’re trying to save space.
* Avoid compressing already-compressed MP3s multiple times - it’s like photocopying a photocopy and expecting perfection.

TL;DR

* How to compress MP3: Reduce bitrate or re-encode using a reliable tool.
* Top tools: Audacity, any online MP3 compressor, or command-line utilities (for the hardcore nerds).
* Keep quality in mind: 128–192 kbps is decent for most listeners.
* Backup originals: Trust me, it’s a must.  

\[Edit\] Some online MP3 compressors have size limits or watermarking, so if your library is huge, stick with desktop apps. Also, some people swear by FFmpeg for batch compression - it’s like wielding a lightsaber, powerful but intimidating.

So Reddit, what’s your approach to mp3 compression? Do you trust your files to fancy online compressors, or are you an Audacity/FFmpeg diehard who meticulously sets every parameter? How small have you managed to get your music library without turning it into a crunchy mess? I need tips, because my disk space is still screaming.

1ojsoxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQE_Prep/comments/1ojsoxz/the_three_stages_of_sqe_dread_a_survival_guide/,The Three Stages of SQE Dread: A Survival Guide (2nd Edition),"If you’re preparing for the SQE, you already know - it’s not just an exam; it’s a lifestyle. But more importantly, it’s an emotional rollercoaster with three distinct stages:

1. **Preparation Panic** 📝💀
2. **Exam Day Terror** 😱✍️
3. **Results Limbo** ⏳🤯

Let’s break them down.

# Stage 1: Preparation Panic - The Denial and Despair Era

It starts innocently enough. You tell yourself:  
*""This is fine. I just need to make a study plan and stick to it.""*

Fast forward two weeks, and you’re drowning in a sea of notes, flashcards, and unanswered practice questions. You develop four different study schedules, each more ambitious than the last, and still find yourself watching “just one more” YouTube video explaining contract law… in ASMR format.

Symptoms include:

* Frantically highlighting everything in your textbook because everything is important.
* Questioning why on earth you didn’t go into a simpler profession (like lion taming).
* Convincing yourself you’ll wake up at 5 AM to study (spoiler: you won’t).
* A constant state of existential dread fueled by coffee and panic.
* You mutter Latin phrases like *res ipsa loquitur* in your sleep.
* You google “Can you pass SQE by sheer luck?” at 2 AM.

And of course:  
You score a 70% on a mock and immediately post it on a forum asking: “AM I COOKED??”, secretly hoping someone will say, “No bro, you’re actually ahead of 90% of people.”

You’re taking practice tests like it’s your full-time job, only to discover that your “educated guesses” were more “guess” than “educated.”

# Stage 2: Exam Day Terror – The Chaos Chronicles

The night before the exam, you think *“I should go to bed early"" or “I just need to be well-rested.”* Instead, you wake up on exam day after exactly 27 minutes of sleep, feeling like you’ve been hit by a truck - possibly because you *dreamt* about trust law chasing you down a dark alley. You suddenly remember that you never actually finished revision for at least three subjects\*,\* and actually, you have no idea about the Solicitors Accounts. But it’s fine, right? Right?!

Arriving at the exam center, you see two types of candidates:

1. The “Calm and Prepared” (who are they?! Are they even real?!)
2. The “Frantically Whispering Latin Phrases” (your people).

As you sit down and read the first question, your brain does the following:

1. Deletes everything you ever knew about the subject.
2. Suggests you move to a remote island and start a new life.
3. Recalls the exact plot of an irrelevant Netflix show you watched two years ago.

So, the first question:

*""How do you call a barrister during court proceedings?""*

Your brain:  
🚨 **SYSTEM ERROR** 🚨  
🚨 **404: KNOWLEDGE NOT FOUND** 🚨

Your options:  
(A) Stare at the screen hoping for divine intervention.  
(B) Select the answer that “feels” right (""My learned best friend 4eve"").  
(C) Think about every mistake you’ve ever made in life.  
(D) All of the above.

Best answer: **D**.

**Fifth question:** *Oh no. This is a trick.*

**Twentieth question:** *If I just pick C for everything, statistically, I should pass…*

By the time you hit the final question, you’re this close to picking “Consideration is… consideration” as a SBA and walking out. But you power through, exit the exam hall, and immediately google **“SQE pass rate 2024-25”** as if that will somehow help.

**Spoiler:** it doesn’t. It’s 41%.  
So technically, you have a better chance of surviving a coin toss if the coin is slightly biased toward despair.

After the exam, you pretend to be okay, but the second someone asks **“How did it go?”**, you either:  
a) Laugh hysterically.  
b) Stare into the distance like a war veteran.  
c) Both.

# Stage 3: Results Limbo – The Endless Abyss or The Schrodinger’s Lawyer Effect

Now begins the real torture: waiting.

Days turn into weeks, and you start analyzing every single question you answered. *Did I pick the right answer for that SBAQ? Did I read the question correctly? Was ""Rylands v Fletcher"" the right answer, or was that just my mood at the time?*

Your coping mechanisms include:

* Replaying every question in your head like a bad horror movie.
* Trying to convince yourself that ""*it’s over, you don’t care anymore.”*
* Googling “SQE pass rates” daily as if that helps.
* Assuming the SRA lost your results because it’s been *three* hours and you haven’t heard back yet.

And the group chats are full of people saying:  
*""I definitely failed.""* (They probably passed.)  
*""I think I did okay.""* (They definitely passed.)  
*""I don’t want to talk about it.""* (They passed *in Q1*.)

At this point, you go through five stages of grief:

1. **Denial** – *Maybe they lost my paper? Maybe they’ll cancel the results and let me retake for free?*
2. **Anger** – *Why did they make equity and trusts so confusing?!?*
3. **Bargaining** – *If I pass, I’ll never procrastinate again!*
4. **Depression** – *Time to update my LinkedIn bio to ""Aspiring... something else.""*
5. **Acceptance** – *Screw it. If I fail, I’ll just become an influencer and sell study notes instead.*

Then, **THE EMAIL ARRIVES**. You stare at it like it’s a live bomb. Heart pounding. Hands shaking. You whisper, *“Maybe if I don’t open it, I both passed and didn’t.”*  
After 57 minutes of mental negotiations, you finally click.

**Outcome 1: You Passed 🎉**  
You scream. You cry. You immediately forget every legal principle you learned.  
Within five minutes, you’re updating LinkedIn like *“Hard work pays off 💪 #SQE #Resilience”* \- even though last week you Googled *“Can you still call yourself a lawyer if you fail the SQE twice?”*

**Outcome 2: You Didn’t Pass 😭**  
You stare at the screen in silence, go through all five stages of grief in under ten minutes, then open Excel to make a new “Study Plan - FINAL FINAL (v6)” file.  
You tell your friends *“It’s just part of the journey,”* while quietly Googling *“SQE resit dates + motivational quotes.”*

Until SQE2, that is. ",6,1761806930.0,SQE_Prep,0,1.0,False
1ojsorv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ojsorv/rf_dont_open_your_eyes/,[RF] Don't Open Your Eyes,"“Don’t open your eyes.”

Those were the four words we said the most in the trenches. Mud-caked uniforms, unwashed, unshaven faces, blood crusted over half-healed wounds.

It was a miracle. If you keep your eyes shut, you can’t see anything. Rocket science. It might not seem like much, but it saved us. Because darkness isn’t blood, or mud, or missing limbs, or weaponry, or desperate faces.

When the sounds of guns and explosions get too loud, we close our eyes. When the pain gets too much, we close our eyes. When the war never seems to end, we close our eyes.

 

The first time I heard the phrase, it came from Tommy, the rough-cut lad next to me in the trench. “Don’t open your eyes,” he muttered, his own eyes sealed shut by mud and the sheer willpower to ignore everything above us. I thought him strange then, but little did I know what an anchor it would be.

I could pretend the pounding wasn’t real and the screams… well, I could pretend not to know what they were. Who they were.

Tommy wasn’t always quiet. He used to talk about his father’s repair shop, in the early days, before the world got too loud. Said he liked fixing things. “Machines make sense,” he’d tell me. “People break for no reason at all.”

 

“Don’t open your eyes.”

We clung onto those words, harder than we clung to each other when explosion after explosion ripped apart the world around us. Whenever things got bad—and they were *always* bad—we’d press our foreheads against the mud and murmur it.

The days melted into one long, smoggy smear. We’d crawl out before dawn, guns heavy as guilt. There were bodies everywhere, but you stopped seeing them after a while. Just lumps. Shapes. Another life traded for a few inches of dead, harrowing ground.

 

We used to be a full platoon—twenty of us, all grinning idiots when we first arrived. By winter we had been halved. Then halved again. Tommy and I stopped counting. It hurt too much.

The others went in all sorts of ways. Shells. Bullets. Mines. The ground swallowing them up. Sometimes they died quiet, sometimes they didn’t. You learned not to look too long. Looking made it stick.

I remember one night, Tommy found me staring at what was left of a boy from the next trench. He nudged me hard and said, “Close your darn eyes, Nate. Don’t give it the satisfaction.”

That’s the trick, you see. If you don’t look, it’s not real. The dark can be kind if you let it.

 

We were ordered forward one morning. Grey skies sagged above us, thick with smoke and everything we’d done. “Advance,” they said, like that meant anything anymore.

Tommy and I went first, crawling through mud that sucked at our boots. The air reeked of gunpowder and ghosts.

We reached a line of twisted wire. Beyond it, nothing but fog and despair.

Tommy looked over and did his best attempt at a grin that you can in a war, teeth stark white against the filth. “Almost there, Nate,” he said, flicking a stand of mud-stained brown hair from his face.

I wanted to believe him as we crept a little further. I really did.

Then, suddenly—

Bang.

The world split open.

Then… silence.

The kind that isn’t really silence, because there’s still the gasping, the ringing, the way the world hums when you’re not sure if you’re still part of it.

I hit the ground hard. Couldn’t tell which way was up. Someone was shouting, but it sounded far away, like an echo from a dream. Maybe Tommy. Maybe me.

I tried to open my eyes, but everything spun, too bright, too loud, too real*.*

I wanted to call out, but my throat just made a broken noise. The kind that doesn’t belong to the living.

 

The horizon flickers, a reel burning mid-frame. In a heartbeat, the battlefield dissolves into a summer field, the stench of rot giving way to wildflowers.

It was a warm day—the kind that hums quietly, as if even the air’s too content to move.

“Don’t open your eyes,” I told her, one hand laced with hers, the other brushing aside grass stalks that stretched across the path.

Evelyn laughed, the sound bright and careless, spilling out into the field like sunlight. “Nathan, if this is another one of your so-called surprises…”

“Trust me,” I said, guiding her forward. The grass brushed against our ankles; somewhere a bird was singing as if it didn’t know the world could ever be cruel. Gold melted into blue as the river glimmered just ahead.

 

The laughter fades first, then the sunlight. What’s left is the ache—the kind that smells like smoke and sounds like someone calling my name through the dark. I lie in that mess of mud and blood and things we don’t name anymore. Time holds its breath, but still somehow keeps bleeding out. And even in the dark, I still think. About my life: before, now and then.

I want mornings with Evelyn, sunlight spilling across her hair, her laughter filling the kitchen while I make her coffee wrong on purpose. I want the ordinary, the quiet, the life that feels too precious to name in the trenches.

I want to walk across that broken field one last time, not as a shadow, not as a ghost, but as someone who lived.

Every friend who fell—every boy I called brother—I want to honour them with my living, with every small breath that insists I am still here.

I want everything, but I am caught in the space between wanting and fearing, between memory and reality, between eyes shut and eyes forced open.

 

My thoughts flicker, jumping frames. The smoke swallows me, and the field rises again, bright and impossible. Mud gives way to grass, the stench of smoke replaced by rain and river breeze.

Evelyn wrinkled her nose. “I swear, if I step in one more puddle—”

“You won’t. Promise.”

We stopped. My heart thudded like a drumline under my ribs. I dropped to one knee, ring box trembling in my hand. The tiny circle of silver and opal suddenly seemed so dull and insignificant next to her beauty.

“Okay,” I whispered, my hands trembling ever so slightly. “Now you can open them.”

She saw me, gasped, and started to cry.

When she said yes, I thought I could live forever. As I kissed her, I closed my eyes, not to escape, but to embrace.

 

The memory slips, cracks, and fades like film burning through a projector.

I can hear Tommy—or maybe just think I do—calling my name, the desperation raw and human. But I’m far away now. The dark is soft, warm, almost familiar.

Don’t open your eyes.

Because that’s what kept us alive.

Because I’m not sure if I even remember how.

Because if I do, the darkness will vanish, and with it, the world, Evelyn, and the part of me that still remembers how to live.

Mud presses into my cheek, damp and heavy. Voices. Running feet. A hand on my shoulder, shaking me, begging.

“Stay with me, Nate! You hear me?”

Every instinct tells me to respond, to open my eyes, to face the world once again. The world narrows to the sound of that voice – Tommy’s, maybe. Or just memory pretending to be mercy.

I used to close my eyes so that I didn’t have to bear the grief that strikes every time I see another soldier gone. But now… it’s because I don’t want to see that same grief in their eyes.

Tommy’s voice is gruff with tears that couldn’t fall.

“Please, Nate. Open your eyes. Please open your eyes.”

1ojsoqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/1ojsoqh/i_am_lost/,I am lost,"I have been thinking about making this post for months, and wasn't sure I should. Mostly because I doubt anything anyone says can help.

I have spent the last 8 years completely shut down, no goals, ambition, or desires. Just empty existence. I know depression is a massive contributor as well as self-loathing. As far as I'm concerned I deserve every bit of suffering I ender, because I failed at everything that really matters.

This year I thought I'd try again though, went to my doctor got on antidepressant's. Picked up a full time job. (hadn't worked full time in all this time). Started exercising, not to much just light workouts a few times a week, know myself and didn't want to bite off more then i could chew. Things were going fairly well.

It all started to fall apart again a couple months ago, first the job was proving far more challenging then i thought it be. Not that it was to hard, it was just a lot of little things adding up. long days, no overtime time pay, they didn't like taking coffee breaks. It was a 4-8 man crew depending on the day and amount of projects on the go, knew if I pushed for breaks they would probably let me take them. The boss was actually fairly reasonable when approached but also knew it was the kind of thing that would create resentment between me and other crew members. Didn't want that. The stress was starting to get to me though, not just because of that, but also because the work involved some working at some heights. I'm not vary good with heights but forced myself to do the work the best I could. Those days were by far the toughest, I'd be tensed up for hours on end.

It really came to a head only a few months in. I have an old ulcer I got from working an extremely stressful job in my early 20's. It came back. Next I had a reaction to the antidepressant's, thought it was a heart attack. Went to the hospital everything checked out, even wore a heart monitor for a few days to see if anything showed up. Nothing, still not sure what happened but dropped the med's. (with advise from my doctor). Got on a new antidepressant, as well as stomach meds for the ulcer.

Then the depression started to come back, the old thoughts started creeping back in. The ones that said ""why am i doing this? what's the point?"". I'm 43, got 2 grown kids that moved away years ago. Want nothing to do with me, I was always distant after my ex left me. I was really worried about rubbing off on them, I had been deeply depressed for most of there life. I always tried to be there, made most birthdays/Christmas's. Took them every other weekend when the situation aloud for its, but always distant. quite, scared if I let the mask slip they might end up as miserable like me.

Never really had a career, didn't graduate high school. (that's a hole other story). Was with my kids mother while still in high school, her friend got knocked up and she wanted to share in her best friends experience. Plus she cheated on me but still wanted me and i was an idiot and stayed. She went off birth control without telling me got pregnant during a ""brake"". When my daughter was born we didn't even give her my last name because of the timing we couldn't be sure, got a DNA test. She was mine, I knew i had to do the right thing but it was really hard to stay. 2 years later her bestie gets knocked up again, within six months my girlfriends pregnant again. This is when she told me the truth about her trying to get pregnant with both my kids by going off birth control without my knowledge. I didn't know what to think or say.

At this point we were 21-22 years old 2 kids, dog, cat, duplex, nice yard good friends working for my fathers contracting company as a site superior (this is where i picked up the ulcer). Other then the madness of getting here in many ways i was living the dream. Had 3 vehicles, my work truck a decent car for girlfriend, and a 89 Toyota pickup that i worked on and took camping with us to play in the mud in the mountains. She's a stay at home mom, some days took care of friends kids for a few extra bucks.

Its tough though, I work 50-60 hours a week. I get paid a salary 45k a year gross, moneys always tight. The girl friend still wants to live the party life, goes to the bar every weekend. I go once a month or so but  I hate it. She cant stop spending money, buys little thing all the time. ""it just a few dollars"" she'd say but its almost every day. She gets department credit cards i don't know about, maxes them all out.

The job is brutal, its none stop. Start literally having nightmares about work, wake up feeling like i just worked a full day but its actually just starting. My boss/father is a nightmare, he was always mentally abusive even growing up. I get fired so often it becomes a running joke between me and the other staff. I'm good at the job though it was the only thing that kept me going, I had my sites running like clockwork. That part was extremely gratifying, never had a late completion. customers happy, trades happy. The only one not happy was boss man. He just hated my approach i think, one incident always stood out. I was working late, it was 8-9pm. I'm on a site installing door locks for the trades coming the next day. Its near one of his partners home and i guess he was there having a few drinks, saw my truck came over and just starts taring in to me. ""What the f\*\*k are you doing here this late?"", i tell him i have trades coming first thing and just need to get the locks on. He says "" well if you didn't dog f\*\*k so much you wouldn't have to be here this late"". I'm speechless, I cant believe what I'm hearing. I just finish up and  go home.

Home life is rough to, girlfriends hungover every weekend. Almost never has the house clean let alone meals for when I get home. I hit a braking point when my son is around 1, scared she might get her self pregnant again i get my tubes tied. Think my girlfriend was more against it then she let on and becomes more distant. While recovering from surgery my work suffers, take some holiday time off. Not for the first time, me and the other supervisor got 2 weeks paid vacation a year and covered for each other, this time though he sabotaged me. Pulled all my trades off all my jobs for the whole 2 weeks, when I get back I'm in shock, but just got to it. Got all the jobs caught back up, still made every completion date. (had to call in a lot of favors and extra hours though). Things feel different though my passion is gone, I'm just a zombie going threw the motions. Then i get fired again, this time i just go home. A few hours go by and the boss calls, ""are you at home?, why the hell aren't you at the job site?"". I do go back to work but only for a couple more weeks. Then i just completely fold one day, just stopped showing. Didn't answer the phone nothing. Wasn't sure what to do, i was miserable. eventually go in to the office to drop off my phone and note books but I'm done. Apparently I found out later almost all of my trades left the company after hearing I quit, they wouldn't work for the other sup or my father. That felt good not gonna lie.

Home life is in ruins though, i was taking a bit of time. The girlfriend still going out all the time. we almost burn threw all of our savings. Then the ex drops the bomb, she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I try to reassure her, i can easily get another in the oilfield making more money then i was making. She doesn't care. I find out later she was sleeping with one of her bar buddies for at least 2 months before she broke up with me. they're living together within a month. I was right about her wanting more kids though, she popped out 4 more with this guy.

I'm destroyed, the thought of not being there with my kids is devastating . Its over though, i do get a job in the oil field start paying child support, try to still be a part of my kids lives. Get a call while away at work, its the bank. Their repossessing the car, its in both our names. I had been paying extra so she could keep the car but she didn't make the payments.

So there i was less then a year ago i had it all, now nothing. not even my credit score. I spend the next 15ish years bouncing from job to job no real focus just trying to keep a roof over my head and child support paid. Dead inside though.

Meet a girl at one point I'm in my mid 30s rooming with a buddy, she moves in he moves out. its actually kind of good. She's amazing, great cook, supportive, good with the kids. She falls in love, i kind of love her to... kind of. Discover I cant love like i used to, I'm closed off, struggling to hold down jobs still. Its just to much sometimes. Realize she deserves someone better, someone not broken. So i start to push her away, it works just like i plan she falls out of love. Then she wants to brake up, her idea. I was happy I didn't have to brake her heart. Still to this day hope she found someone she deserves and is happy.

A few years go by, nothing changes. Employments sketchy, I move in with friends or family sometimes when i fail at maintaining my own place. Then things get really bad, the ex wants to move to the other side of the country with her new guy. Kids want to go with her I agree, not gonna stand in there way. It hits hard though.

At this point I'm living with my grandma work really dries up, Ex gets maintenance enforcement involved. I'm broke, license suspended, bank accounts frozen. Got no one and nothing, my grandmas mental heath is gone. Basically live in care giver. Then the day comes i decide i really cant do it anymore. Sell my car for cash, give my grandma a bunch for bills and rent. I go and buy 8k in lottery tickets decide if i don't win enough to start over its the Remington retirement plan for me. Of course i don't win anything, start planning my send off, the big day comes. I freeze, cant do it. Turns out I'm a cowered. Didn't chose to live  just to scared to die.

So that's where I'm at, been stuck here for 7-8 years now. living with my uncle now pretty sure I'm going to be homeless in the next month or so. Owe around 30k in back pay, still no license or anything.

Here's the rub though, the reason I started trying again. Last year my ex passed away, she suffered a blow to the head at work, developed a brain bleed and died. I know i need to try to get my shit together for the kids, there 24 and 21 now. Still live on the other side of the country though and I'm not just starting from scratch but need to get out of this whole I'm in, but decades of depression and bad habits stand in my way, and i honestly don't have in me most days but I'm still trying. I am just so stuck and don't know how to pick up the pieces.",1,1761806908.0,malementalhealth,0,1.0,False
1ojso8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ojso8w/im_confused_about_a_girl_who_used_to_show/,I’m confused about a girl who used to show interest but now seems distant. What should I do?,"
Hey everyone,

[Both of us are girls] So, the girl(let her be V for the post) started showing interest to me a year ago. Like, our first encounter: she asked for my instagram acc; second: she lied to me about some malfunctions with her ice cream barcode to pay for my ice cream. Mind u she was busy that time, like pretty packed schedule, but when i was leaving the building she run up to me and said that she wants to go somewhere, but left right after she bought me an ice cream. 
After that, she started inviting me for dinners, coffees and just whenever sees me, runs to me just to say hi and have small talk. Like she was only interested in me, even if i was with my friends, she would take me out of my friend group to talk. My other friends were complaining that she always ignores them whenever they say hi, but with me she is the one who initiates it. 
There were this kind of signs, and the most like meaningful ones: 
1) [Our first semester] I was playing with my friend's bag and annoying my friend in the elevator, but I suddenly felt how someone was looking at me and when I faced that direction, I saw V looking at me with the gentlest smile ever, she was all relaxed and the gaze she was giving me(love eyes kinda shi), instantly made me feel some feelings. I think that moments is the time when I started falling for her. 
2) [Our first semester(end)] By the end of semester, suddenly she started getting distant, but when we were talking before our flights back to our countries, she tried to hug me, like I saw how she was reaching out to hug me, but suddenly stopped and high fived me. I was a dumb@ss for just staring at her when she was doing that, but god forbid girl who fell out of the world 
3) [Second semester] V was not living in the same building as me, so we didnt cross paths at all. However, I was checking on her and then she started inviting me to her place to play and after some time V started inviting me for dinners only. Like, she texted ""Do u wanna play table tennis w me?"" And after I agreed, she said ""Oh, sorry, i got too excited and forgot that my eyesight is blurry right now, but can we go to the dinner?""
During these dinners, she would say something like ""Actually, in relationships, I am avoidant"" out of nowhere. Or she be staring dead me into the eyes and say ""I missed u"" when i was just telling some stories. She gave me a letter and present for my birthday
4) [Second semester(around mid-end)] V invited me to the night club and said to her other friends that they dont have to worry about her, cuz I am gonna be there w her. After getting my jacket, since it was cold, she told me that I look hot without my jacket. And she was taking pictures and videos of me that never reached me. 
She was learning words in my language, specifically the words that I like. 

5)[Second semester(a girl hitting on me)] It was around end of the semester, and there was a girl who started flirting with me. And V saw it and got ""jealous"". Like we were sitting like girl - me - V. And V was saying something like ""I am gonna do this project later, but I cant focus rn"" and straight after our interaction she invited me to play together(not dinner) and my friend who had the same class with her said that she was really upset and mad looking at her phone(the time when she texted me inviting) 
We didnt talk that much by the end of the semester, but we accidentally met on the hallway, and both of us froze seeing each other and she said under her breath  ""you are so beautiful"" and then left, letting me stay there

6) [This(3rd) semester] We r on the same floor. I dont have any kind of relatolionship and didnt have(just in case). She started avoiding me like crazy. Going one floor down by stairs just to not talk to me, or getting away from her friend company whenever I was there talking and getting back after I leave that group. So I texted her and asked what is happening. She said that she is uncomfortable around me and she doesnt know how to be friends w someoen who have feelings for her. So I started getting cold towards her and avoiding, because I couldnt stand seeing her. At first she was okay, but after like 2 weeks, she was the one who was running after me. 

Like, if she was going to get a water from the community room, while i was going down, she left her bottle in the community room and chased after me to be in the same elevator. Or leaving her little grocery, just to walk towards our floor together. Or meddling into the convo between my friends and rangom person just to give some glsnces to me(i was hughing my friend and ""crying"" bcz I missed her). 

Also, she lately started getting nervous around me(we didnt saw each other for a long time), like her voice shaking, she is being all fidgety and strange, but still initiated small talk. Also, V started waiting for me to speak first to her. Because, 2 days ago, I just came to the elevator and she took of her earphones immediately (she usually keeps them on, even if there r her friends), also she was stealing glances, like when she thought that I wasnt looking at her, she slowly looked at me and when met my gaze, her eyes started going around everywhere but me


I would like to move on from her, but I am just so devastated, like I even have dreams w her. And rn i dont want anyone, but her, but i know i have to move on, because she doesnt have feelings for me(she told that). I dont know what to do and how to be. I would appreciate some advice.

P.S. She is from southeast asian country, I am from central asian.",1,1761806854.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1ojsnac,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1ojsnac/blonde_blazer_ep_3_4/,Blonde Blazer | EP 3 & 4,"Hi chat.

I really want for us to talk about the mild revelations we received about BB this week.

In comparison to last week, I have an even harder time understanding now why people just outright hate her. I do have to mention that these two episodes with Visi really made me feel for her and love her, but I just can not simply skim past BB's further explored identity.

I think in the first two episodes we got multiple reminders that overall, she's home to two separate personalities - her work persona, and then the girl under that no one knows and no one sees. Even last week I was thinking she's probably high-masking (both figuratively and literally lol) and now I am so sure of it.

First of all, she hints at deep, deep loneliness, isolation and possibly sadness underneath her perfectly constructed mask. I'm sorry, drinking pure alcohol out of the bottle? Very heavy indicator that she's unhappy. I don't want to overexplain it, but from my PoV, if you pour it out you want to enjoy it. If you don't, you just want the effect to wash over you ASAP. Is she okay?

On the billboard, she lets Robert know she is not drunk enough to share her story yet. Yet another hint that she's a bit more loose, it is way less Blonde Blazer that we see there (hence the unprofessional boundary crossing) and more her normal, average self that is probably a bit self-conscious, has anxiety, maybe even overthinks? I think she finds comfort in Robert, maybe they have details about their past that are similar and it makes her feel like she bonds easier with him.

A couple of times during the new episodes she felt a bit odd, a bit awkward? Like very high-functioning awkward. She has strange replies, she is a bit slow. Makes me think she is conflicted - and as we learn, she does end up pullng through with the decision to break up with Phenomaman, which is entirely understandable since meeting Robert had her conflicted already, maybe because for once someone tried to see who she was underneath all the shit she puts on as a front. It is endearing and honestly I support this all the way.

I had no issues with her these episodes, no red-flags that I noticed. I think her question to ask Robert if he was still around to eat together was sweet, and the scene to kiss her, although still a LITTLE rushed, felt way more right than the first time around. Even prior that we see her shaking her legs, Robert assumes its the coffee but I am pretty sure she was nervous/anxious. It's sweet. She gets self-conscious about how utterly average she is underneath the powers, the masks, hair color makes her question her own innate attractiveness.

I don't see her turning into the villain everyone's expecting. I'm loving the layers we are shown, and while I understand why people prefer Visi in one way or another, I have to say that while her issues are surface level, that does not mean Blazer does not have her own complexities that are purely ignored just because she's better at hiding them.

To argue that she's more put together, more successful, seems happier completely diminishes her layered and complex personality. Deep under all of it, she seems incredibly lonely. Justice for my girl.",10,1761806746.0,DispatchAdHoc,6,1.0,False

From smart contract design, DeFi platforms, GameFi backends, to NFT marketplaces and Telegram bots — I help clients turn their blockchain ideas into real, working products.

I’ve worked on:

 Ethereum / BSC / TON smart contracts (Solidity)

 DeFi / GameFi / SocialFi project architecture

 Web3 integrations using Node.js, Go, and Python

 Unity + blockchain game backend systems

 Secure key management & encryption (RSA / AES)

 Full-stack dashboards with React + Gin (Go)

Whether it’s building a staking system, creating a token with fair launch logic, or optimizing smart contract gas efficiency, I’ve probably done it before — and delivered on time.

 Clients often come to me with just an idea.

We discuss the tokenomics, the flow, the architecture — and then I build everything end-to-end.

From concept → to smart contract → to Web3 UI → to deployment.

Web3 is still early, but that’s exactly why I love it.

Every project is a chance to shape what the next Internet will look like.

I spent countless late nights fixing bugs, adjusting logic, and polishing the interface.

1ojsknh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1ojsknh/are_you_pragmatic_while_setting_goals/,Are you pragmatic while setting goals?,"Creating unrealistic goals and not achieving those creates an unnecessary vortex of frustration, while sticking to realistic goals helps build confidence one step at a time. Let's deep dive into a few nuances on setting study goals:


1. When you see XYZ scoring a 99th percentile on the GMAT with ""*a""* hours of study, your proclivity is to believe that you too can achieve a similar score with ""*a*"" hours of study. You are not alone because a metric that aspirants focus on is ""number of study hours,"" as if there's an invisible correlation between this yardstick and GMAT score. This can not be farther from the truth as most fail to recognize that this magic number will depend on individual factors of which the most fundamental is your current skill level. And that will define your study goals.


2. A metric can only be the same for two people when both of them are identical in every way, which, in real life, is a far-fetched idea. Even twins display disparate personalities and behavioral orientations, and in GMAT prep, we are talking about comparing two unrelated individuals, and this seems to be an abortive endeavor. Instead, a more purposeful undertaking would be ""knowing oneself fully,"" which, you will argue, is again a difficult journey. Thankfully, in terms of GMAT prep, it is not so laborious as you have the ways and means to conjure up a response to this brain-scratching problem.


3. Read three RC passages from areas such as science, humanities, business, and social science. Did you feel at ease with all those passages? Could you instantly understand what the author wants to convey? Could you immediately dissect the organization of those passages? These are a few leading questions, and there could be more. A ""yes"" to all these questions should make you believe that you have basic familiarity with multiple topics. A person who answers ""no"" to any or all of these questions should be aware of the fact that he/she has some work to do in terms of developing the required familiarity. Now, could you see how the current skill level of the person who answers ""yes"" to all questions differs from that of the person who answers ""no"" to any or all those questions? You could figure this out for quant as well by seeking answers to topic-specific questions. 


4. After a realization that everyone starts prep from a different pedestal, another aspect is figuring out what to do next? The first and foremost step is being honest with yourself. If you can dedicate an hour for prep on weekdays and 4 hours on weekends, that's a hard stop in terms of goal setting. You should not aim to study 2 hours on weekdays and 8 hours on weekdays, and thereby not meet your study goals while living in an illusory castle. Those castles crash sooner or later, and such crashes can make you question your choices in very different ways. Trust me, you would want to avoid those.


5. Be objective while setting goals so that you eventually achieve 100% of those. Then, if you want to push yourself a bit, increase the quantum of those goals by 10%. Small deltas are often not noticed by the brain, and so you will not get tired by those little increments. On the other hand, a mammoth increase of 50% will make you go nuts, and you will eventually give up trying to achieve those lofty milestones. It's often the boring and simple things done consistently that make all the difference.  

  
6. You must know how your brain functions in terms of attention spans. Some people can be 100% attentive for 45 minutes, while others experience a fall in their attention levels after 30 minutes. The trick is to understand the functioning of your brain and optimize your rhythms for the best results. A person whose attention span nosedives after 45 minutes should embrace a goal that incorporates study times not exceeding three quarters of an hour.


7. Do you get easily bored after repeatedly doing the same task? Eventually, everyone gets bored at some point in time. The trick is to identify when that boredom kicks in? Does that kick in after a few hours or after a few days? If it engulfs you in a few hours, you can not create a goal that involves studying quant for two days and then switching to verbal. A more feasible goal would be studying quant for an hour and then transitioning to verbal.


8. Do you keep a tab on your break time? And, what do you do during breaks? Your goals should clearly specify the time for breaks. Do not consider someone else's break time to be your north star because your brain may take more or less time than others to rejuvenate. Since there's a lot of cognitive load while studying, it would be best for you to do something during breaks that calms your brain. Maybe you can take a short nap, observe nature, meditate, do breathing exercises, listen to specific forms of music, grab a coffee, etc. These are personal choices, and you should know what truly relaxes your brain while avoiding activities that unknowingly stimulate your brain.


9. Life happens, and you should create goals that take into account such exigencies. Ensure that you are creating a goal and not a rigid project plan. While there should be specific milestones in your prep journey, disturbing your natural body rhythm and overstretching yourself does not help. 


The more you know yourself, the easier goal setting would be for you. I would love to know your thoughts on this. Happy goal setting and prepping!",1,1761806455.0,GMAT,0,1.0,False

Haven't passed a proper stool in two weeks :( anyone else struggle after antibiotics?,"Tl;Dr, can antibiotics trigger a bowel obstruction? Or have other people experienced this? 

Long version:
So, I tested positive for IMO and was prescribed neomycin and rifaximin for two weeks. I only made it through one because my constipation worsened, and even with stimulant laxatives I was only able to pass some watery stool after five days of no BM. The pain was the final straw, as on the last day I took my antibiotics, I had such intense stabbing pain in my upper left abdomen that I couldn't function. Even though I know it's bad to stop antibiotics early, I had to because I was seriously considering going to the ER the pain was so bad.

Fortunately, after stopping, the pain went away but the BM situation has not improved. I've passed some blobby, tiny, thin stools - about once a day for the past five days. Except today. I was thinking about taking another laxative, but after the second laxative I took last week, I pooped myself in my sleep (embarrassing but here we are) so I'm nervous about taking another laxative. Today, nothing has come out. I tried sunfiber, drinking copious amounts of water, yoga, coffee, even picked up a pack of cigarettes I'm so desperate to have a BM. It's felt like I needed to a few times today, but then nothing happens.

The thing that has me typing on reddit though is that today I also developed pretty bad pain in my lower left back. The confounding variable is that I've been sitting at my desk in a garbage office chair more the past two days than usual to study for exams. And having my partner theragun me did relieve some of the pain, so it could very well be just sore muscles from bad ergonomics. But this occurring at the same time as me experiencing some of the worst constipation of my life, to the point that I can't even remember the last time I darted, has me concerned that the antibiotics somehow triggered a bowel obstruction or blockage.

So, good people of reddit, I'm asking for your help. Anyone experience anything like this before? Or have any of you suffered an intestinal blockage? What were your symptoms - did it include back pain? And if you have any sage advice for how to proceed, hit me with it.

My tentative plan for now is to see if the back pain subsides now that my exams are over and I don't have to sit in my torture chair for hours at a time, take another laxative and try not to shit myself again, and give my bowels a rest with a liquid/low residue diet.

A Knight from a forgotten realm, existing within its own Atmospheric Bubble on the far reaches of the Cosmic Ocean that we find ourselves floating so carelessly in. While its original owner is no longer around to share its story, there were scattered pages of a diary belonging to a ‘Hand of Avalār’ who would have called on the Ashes aid. What’s the harm in reading what someone else had left behind? Perhaps it could shed some light on who these people were.""*

\[I am RL713 that can switch between *aggressive* and *supportive* combat. Utilizing *Erdtree Heal*, *Warming Stones*, *Minor Erdtree*, *Uplifting Aromatics*, and a *Crimsonburst Dried Tear*; I can keep both the Host of Fingers and myself alive to the best of both of our abilities. Combining this with *Starlight Shards* and *Lulling Branches*, I ensure that I will stay in the Host’s world for as long as they may need me.

I also do much more than just helping people with Bosses. I heavily enjoy exploring the Open World and Dungeons, seeing things I haven’t before. I’ve played this game a lot and I often find myself going the same routes as I always do, helping people out gives me a chance to see more of this game that I normally would have missed. I also help improvement with *PvP* and *PvE*, however I do not claim to be good at any of these things. My primary goal is to be an immersive and fun experience in a game where *everything* wants to kill you.\]

# Exploration

I will often stick to the Host, as an NPC would, following and assisting in any combat. When I am accompanying new Tarnished, I will often *alert* my Host by calling out to them. An environmentally aware Host can then follow me to various *Key Items* such as *Golden Seeds*, *Perfume Bottles*, *Scadu Fragments*, and many more. The Host can also inform me of anything they are looking for and I can lead them to it once we are in the area. The DLC is my second home, I spend more time vibing there more than anything, sticking mainly to Rauh and  Belurat/Enir-Ilim. Thanks to this, **I have every** ***Scadu Fragment*** **in the DLC marked on my map**.

# Improvement at Player vs Player?

I can spar with you for as long as you need, I even have an Un-Upgraded Loadout so there is less risk of you dying during live exercises. If you want to get better in certain aspects, I can do that as well. Need to get better against *Invaders*? Summon me as an *Adversary* for various types of *Invaders* you’d run across, in a *Non-Toxic Environment*. Want to get better at being an *Invader*? I can summon you as an *Adversary* and you can get a feel for what’s right for you.

# Improvement at Player vs Environment?

I have a **RL713** character with **+0 Equipment** that I’ve almost beaten the *Base Game* and *DLC* on. Here you can *Explore*, *Fight Roaming Bosses*, or *Vibe with Me*. As a *Cooperator*, you won’t have to worry about losing your *Runes* or *Invaders*, since the RL and Upgrades are so different. Have a friend who wants to get better or just be an *Adversary*? That’s fine too, the more the merrier. ***Toxic Players Will Be Blocked***.

# Communication?

Direct Messages are perfectly ok with me, however I do not do VoIP. Much like most of the Ashes in-game, I don’t typically speak. This is because I’m typically in a party or otherwise unable to use my headset, however I will *rarely* make an exception.

# What The Hell Is A “Hand of Avalār”?

A *Hand of Avalār* is the Orders take on an *Avalāriem Oracle*; An Avalāriem who’s incapable of combat on their own, only having a strong connection to Spiritual Arts, they stay out of harm's way and rely on their comrades. Even if that comrade has fallen in battle, a Hand of Avalār can call their spirit back to *dawn their equipment again* and finish what was started.

- **Personal Problem Solving:** Calm, step-by-step advice with clear directions (but don’t expect real therapy).
- **Tech & Coding Help:** Decent for simple code tasks and explanations - though you *must* double-check everything.

---

**5 Mistakes (Almost Everyone Overlooks):**

- **Customer Service is Awful:** Cancelling or refunding is a nightmare; many users report being ignored.
- **Subscription FOMO:** Monthly credits vanish if unused - no rollover, no mercy.
- **Wrong & Made-Up Info:** Constant hallucinations and wrong facts. You’ll need to verify everything it writes.
- **Photo Editing Flops:** Attempts to fix images often ruin faces and colors; not worth relying on.
- **Always Forgets Instructions:** Copilot can’t remember your saved rules - even basic prompts need to be repeated daily.

---

**Cost Breakdown (Read Before You Buy):**

- **Personal Plan: $9.99/month**
- **Family Plan: $12.99/month** (up to 6 people - but only the main account gets Copilot)
- **Premium: $19.99/month** (highest limits - still only for the owner)

You’re locked into subscriptions and lose your unused credits every month.

---

**What To Actually Do Instead?**

If you’re a content marketer, student, or someone who cares about value (and hates wasted credits), *look at platforms where credits never expire and you get real support*. Microsoft Copilot is convenient for MS Office die-hards, but there are alternatives where you pay once and use advanced AI features as needed - no chasing refunds or waiting for next month’s “bonus”.

You can read the complete detailed guide in the link I’ll share in the first comment. If anyone’s got questions about AI tools for writing, content marketing, or solving workflow headaches, I’m always happy to help out (no sales pitch, promise). Hope this saves someone a headache!",1,1761806021.0,content_marketing,6,1.0,False

Allowed naman ako ng boss ko nun sa dati kong work kasi ako naghahandle ng call escalations at minsan 12 am or 3am may mga emergency calls na need ko sagutin, so nasisira tulog ko nun or madalas late na nakakauwi.

Etong inalisan ko infairness naman sobrang importante ang oras sa kanila, for 15 mins late automatic resched na agad ang call. Nakakapanipago din kapag boss mo ang laging maaga pumasok kaya dun ako natuto mag adjust at talagang trabaho kung trabaho, chichika man sa lunch or coffee breaks na.

Ngayon naghahanap ako ng new work, medyo naooff na ako lalo 20 mins or more late na, tapos walang message man lang na malalate. Meron pa hindi na umatend ni sorry or message about it wala, talagang inubos lang time at effort mo. Nadidisrespect lang ako at the same time, it is a blessing kasi dun pa lang kita ko na work culture.

I hope someday matuto din ang mga pinoy magrespect ng oras, bawas bawasan ninyo na pag late ninyo.",4,1761805892.0,ShareKoLang,0,1.0,False

Okay context, I 21f have a friend, named Rose. During our junior of college we decided to look at moving off campus with our other two friends. Me and my other friend we can call Lily, went on apartment tours. We visited our first one we really liked but decided to keep looking. Our friend Rose was adamant on living in the apartment complex her boyfriend was living in at the time. But it was completely out of budget and the rooms were extremely small. We told her that the location wasn’t our favorite but we were still going on tours. She freaked out that we like the first place and was very stubborn on the location. Side note: we also wanted to sign our leases early so it wouldn’t be extremely expensive. Anyways, we keep going on tours. A few weeks later, Rose tells us that she’s going to live at her boyfriend’s parents house, they have a private apartment area. I asked her if she was sure because it was about to be leasing time and that me, lily, and our friend Azalea had to start looking at 3x3 options. I kept asking her up until leasing time if she was positive that she wasn’t going to live with us and she said she was sure. We signed our leases without her and that was the end of that. Fast forward to our senior year of college. Rose’s boyfriend breaks up with her. Luckily she wasn’t kicked out of her living situation, but she didn’t want to be alone there. Which valid. So she was over at my apartment everyday for a month where I was there for her, hung out, consoled her and more. That’s when she starts bringing up that I left her out of the apartment and signed the lease without telling her anything. That we ditched her when she was in the loop the entire time! I have a birthday party with some of the friends, and I introduce her to people that didn’t know her and she starts telling people that I left her out and I was a bad friend and that I made her feel like the only choice was to live at her boyfriend’s parents house. I literally have screenshots like it’s absolutely crazy. I didn’t want to cause a scene at the party but it made very uncomfortable. She starts telling people this and I’m like hey this didn’t happen and she says no y’all told me nothing. This fizzles out until later we’re driving  out for an emergency where I’m sick when out of nowhere she looks at me and goes “I hate you, we’re too similar and I just hate you sometimes, and I’m very pissed at you” then she starts laughing but I’m so taken back. I felt so uncomfortable cus I was stuck in the car. And I was like why and she didn’t answer me back. Later we go bar hopping when she goes to our acquaintance and tell her “I don’t hate you yet, but I will soon. We’re very similar like “me” I’m pissed at her and hate her” when my  acquaintance told me I was shocked. I don’t know what I did to her. I was there for her through everything. Don’t get me wrong I’m stubborn but I’m not rude. I decided to have a conversation with her at a coffee place to bring up the housing thing and her telling me and others that she hates me. But I wanted to know if I’m a asshole for perhaps putting a boundary and say I don’t want to be friends anymore because I feel disrespected and hurt, and ask why she wants to be friends with me if she hates me? Like I’ll apologize if I did something but I can’t think of what I did. I mean I’ve been busy with grad school apps but I still make time for her? Pls let me know if I am an asshole pls!!
