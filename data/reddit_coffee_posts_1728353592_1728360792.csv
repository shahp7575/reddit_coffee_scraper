1fyrcxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fyrcxa/worst_birthday_everrant/,Worst birthday ever(rant),"I've been thinking about writing in here for a while now, but I never felt right about it until today. So quick warning this is probably going to be long and confusing as it's mostly me venting.
I've used to love my dad, he was the best. We did so much togheter, built a treehouse(or he did, I held the tools and thought I was contributing) camped, worked in his workshop he had at home for fun and stuff like that. He even saved my lige when I was 4 or 5. I had gotten a remote controled toy car as an early Christmas gift but accidentally stepped on it and fell, hitting my neck on the edge of the table and I mean like the 90degre corner edge. He rushed me to the hospital just to be told it wasn't serious and we went home but came back a day or two later when I developed a huge lump on my neck. Again they said it wasn't serious and sent us home, but things only got worse and he took me back this time demanding they took a scan of my neck. And low and behold if they had waited like 3 days I would never have been here. So yeah we where close and he was my everything and my hero.
Then disaster. When I was 7 my mom and dad told me they where separating of course me and my younger brothers where devastated (mostly me as they didn't really understand). Then a couple of weeks later my dad got taken away by the police, but i didn't know why. All i knew was that it was my mom's fault. Then I began hearing rumors at school. Just for context we lived in a small town so rumors where everything and they spread fast and went out of control almost as quick. At first I heard that my dad had threatened my mom, then a knife came in to the picture and soon a gun. The rumors kept getting worse and people kept coming to me and asking if they where true. In the end my mom had to tell me the truth. My dad had hit her and threatened her because he had finally realized that they weren't just taking a break but they where getting divorced. So my father went to prison and we of course came to visit him once in a while but as my mom wasn't allowed to go with and was too scared too, a prison priest took us. It was weird seeing my dad like that but I still loved him.
From that point on my dad have never been the same or maybe he has but I just never saw it back then. He began talking badly about my mom and making us believe all his lies. Like how he was innocent, how he had proof and how it was all my mom's fault. Throughout it all my mom was amazing, she was dealing with PTSD (from what happened between them), raising three boys and she never once tried to make us resent our dad. Yes she defended herself because she wouldn't lose us to his lies but she always made it clear that despite everything he was still our dad and we should cherish our bond with him. Unfortunately noone is perfect and my mom made a mistake that would forever impact us. In her loneliness and desperate for help state she found a guy. He seemed awsome but he was everything but. This story is going to be too long if I explain about him too but just know he was there for 6 years and is still affecting our mental state to this day.
When my father got out of prison things got worse, I began believing more and more of his lies now that he had a weekend every two weeks to fill my head with lies. I began to hate my mom for what she had done to my dad. Luckily as I got older I saw my dad's true face. It was in the little things, I regularly caught him saying things about my mom I knew was false. After that I began noticing how he never came to anything I invited him to, like school festivals, the time I was performing a play or other stuff like that. I also began noticing how he would promise all kinds of things but never fulfill them. I got so frustrated and angry, and to this day I still can't believe anything he says without a voice in my head saying ""what if he is lying"".
I also began feeling neglected by him and at some point I felt something had to be done so I took a talk with him but all I got from him was ""you are a child it isn't your responsibility to be the one fixing things it should be me"" and yeah it should be he didn't so I had to. I had to grow up fast to learn how to communicate with people like him, how to handle him, how to talk in a way that wouldn't get him defensive but still get my point across. These are all skills I'm now very glad I have as they help not just with him but in many situations.
Sadly I eventually realized our relationship was a lost cause, but in stead of giving up I kept pressing on. Because even if I didn't get anything from it maybe it would help him realize that if he kept this up he would eventually lose my brothers and me. Sadly our relationship have only gotten worse but at least I can say I have managed to preserve his and my brothers relationship. This is something I'm very proud of as I know how much it hurts to be in this situation and I don't ever want my brothers to feel this way. But after a little over 8 years of struggling (I began trying to fix things when I was around 12 and I'm 21 now) I have finally given up on him.
I know this has been long and I hope I haven't lost everyone, there's just so much to say that I wouldn't be able to write it all. But it's almost over.
Around 9 months back I went to my dad's place and made a last ditch effort to fix us. Until this point I've always been very gentle with him as that is how he works but this time I told him how I felt, all be it without yelling or using nasty words. I put it simple for him and said I was tired of it all and I couldn't do this anymore. I told him how much he hurt me throughout the years and I put a lot of emphasis on how much it hurt when he made the same mistakes with my brothers as he had made with me. I also told him that if he didn't start contributing I was done with him. After around an hour of talking I left and I didn't hear anything from him. I had a backpacking trip in south America planed in 3 months that would last 3 months so my plan was to give him those 6 months to do anything, and I mean anything. The only thing I heard from him was him asking for pictures of my trip, I ignored all those requests as that wasn't him taking initiative and contributing to the relationship but just him being curious. When I came back and hadn't heard anything from him, not even a ""how was the trip"". I realized he was never going to take the initiative and actually invite me to coffee, text me from time to time, call me or my biggest disappointment. Saying sorry for all he had put me through. I have never heard those words from him, not even when we got in fights and wouldn't talk for months I heard them. I always just came back, but not this time. I texted him and made it very clear we where over until he could behave like a dad and say sorry for how he had treated me. I poured my whole soul into that text. I told him everything, I cried texting it. Realizing that when I send this text it would probably be the end, because he would never say sorry, he would never invite me out or call me or anything.
Then today on my 21st birthday he sent me a text like nothing had happened and like we where still talking. I had deliberately not blocked him as I somewhere deep down hopped he would realize his mistake and say sorry. By sending that one ""happy birthday"" text and and greeting me like normal he destroyed all my hopes, and I lost it. I lost it and wrote the nastiest text I have ever written to someone and told him he was a horrible dad and that I hopped I would never see him again. And then i blocked him, so yeah that was my birthday. My first birthday after I moved out and my first birthday without my brothers and my mother and the birthday I will never forget because my dad ruined it.
Again sorry it was so long, hope you all have a better day than me. I will go to bed now as it's 22:22 and I have school tomorrow.

Well, as it turns out, my whole life is just one bad joke. Because as my luck would have it, my roommates Matthew, Sharron, and Damien are literal, honest to god, *monsters.*

Matthew is a witch, Sharron is a vampire, and her boyfriend Damien is a werewolf. I‚Äôve been living with these people for literal months and they chose *now* to tell me the truth?!?

Okay, let me back track and explain to you how I ended up in this situation.

A couple months back I hit a rough patch in my life. It was the off season at work so my hours had been cut (I work at a themed cafe). And then my girlfriend cheated on me and kicked me out of the house, essentially leaving me homeless. I was depressed and desperately in need of a new place to live, so I did the stupid thing and browsed roommate wanted ads on Craigslist. Theirs was the first one I clicked on.

Botta-bing, botta-boom, next thing you know, the four of us were meeting up at a local restaurant to discuss my possible tenancy.

They had their reservations about me at first, as did I them. I mean I answered their *craigslist* ad for crying out loud! That‚Äôs gotta be suspicious to someone considering the site‚Äôs historic link to some of the most gruesome true crime cases in this century. Then again, they did put the ad on the site to begin with so‚Ä¶ hence the meeting.

Well, my first red flag should‚Äôve been that we met up at night. I guess since it wasn‚Äôt too late in the evening when we met (around seven pm) and was in a fairly public place, I thought nothing of it.

After meeting up and getting the pleasantries out of the way we started introducing ourselves. I told them my tale, mostly trying to earn pity points so they‚Äôd let me crash with them- which I think worked pretty well considering I ended up moving in.

Mathew went next. He was an above average looking guy with blonde hair, blue eyes, average height. Pretty normal and unsuspecting looking. I learned he worked as an anesthesiologist assistant and spent his free time either at the library or reading in his room.

It was obvious Sharron and Damien were a couple based on the fact they sat together, were holding hands, and stared at each other with lovey-dovey eyes. They looked like complete opposites to each other.

Sharron definitely fit the goth esthetic with the pasty white skin, long silky black hair, and the signature red lip. Though she looked young, she carried herself with this ‚Äòwise beyond her years‚Äô confidence.

Damien, on the other hand, was a tall and stalky black man with thick dreads and a goatee. Despite his intimidating physical appearance, he wore a green and white flannel button up with grey khakis, was very nice, and actually seemed quite timid giving off mega nerd vibes.

Sharron was definitely the dominant one in the relationship.

Turns out Sharron worked nights at a gas station not too far from the apartment and Damien worked from home doing IT work. See, told you, *nerd.* Or maybe the correct technical term is geek? I dunno.

All in all, everyone seemed to be pretty chill. But, I should‚Äôve known something was off with the three of them as soon as we placed our orders. Working in food service, I‚Äôve learned you can tell a lot about a person by the food they eat.

Sharron only ordered a coffee. At seven pm. *clearly* she had some kind of eating disorder or special diet. (Little did I know how right I was about that). Matthew skipped right past the appetizers and entrees, immediately ordering a chocolate cake type dessert. Weird, but not totally eccentric. Damien‚Äôs order was normal enough, a porterhouse steak bloody rare. The look that shone in his eyes as soon as it was set down on the table almost unsettled me though.

I ordered buttered noodles and chicken tenders since I‚Äôm a picky eater, so I couldn‚Äôt really say shit, and I didn‚Äôt. We ate dinner in between polite small talk before we got down to it.

They were looking for a serious roommate. Someone who paid rent on time, helped with groceries, all that. Specifically, they wanted someone who could be trusted, someone who wasn‚Äôt loud and could keep to themselves. Someone peaceful and unproblematic. Something their last roommate apparently hadn‚Äôt been.

I reassured them that would be me or at least I would try my best to be. They bought it and invited me over for a tour of the apartment the next day.

Apartment four-thirteen. It was the thirteenth, and largest, unit on the fourth floor. It was a four bed three bath with about two-thousand square feet. Matthew had the master, and despite being together, Damien and Sharron had their own rooms, but shared a connected bathroom. I would take the empty room, which was the smallest, and have my own bathroom. The communal spaces were the large living room that had floor to ceiling stain glass windows and the decently sized kitchen. Rent was nine-seventy five, bills were separate, all due by the fifth of the month. *And* my commute to work would be easier there. Honestly, it was a pretty sweet deal that I just couldn‚Äôt pass up.

After they gave me a final offer and we got the lease all settled, I was moved in by the end of the week.

Now, you might be asking yourselves, ‚ÄúJoey, how did you not realize there was something *off* about your roommates?‚Äù

Well, to be honest with you, everything was going so well those first couple months I didn‚Äôt really notice. Mostly because everyone‚Äôs hectic schedules prevented all of us from being in the apartment at the same time for an extended period.

I work all kinds of crazy hours at the cafe during the day so I was in and out of the apartment sporadically. Since Sharron worked nights the most I saw of her was when she came home in the morning and when she left for work at night. Matt was pretty much always at the hospital or the library. Damien stayed in his room all the time playing video games and doing his IT work.

When all of us *were* home, we pretty much just stayed confined to our personal spaces. Looking back on it, now knowing the truth, there were some signs.

Matthew had a full on garden growing in his room and so many candles that even candle hoarders would deem that many as too much. He also always seemed to have a homemade remedy at the ready for any injury or problem that could arise.

Sharron kept her room dark *dark*. The walls were painted black and most of the accents in her room were either deep shades of red or gray. She has a mini fridge under her desk, but when I saw her room for the first time, it was covered with a dark sheet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there was a pad lock keeping it shut.

Once a month, for about a week, Damien seemed to get irritated pretty easily. He also stocked up on red meats during that time, leaving the apartment in a perpetual state of smelling like a steakhouse. Then at the end of that week, Damien and Sharron would leave for a date night, not returning home until late in the evening the next day.

So, what led my roommates to reveal their true identities to me (intervention style I might add)? Well, I think it all started last week when I started developing some symptoms and feeling sick.

I let everyone know I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and would try my best to quarantine myself to my room to prevent the illness from spreading. Matt offered me a special cream, a salve I think he called it, to try to help alleviate my symptoms. I politely refused.

About mid week I noticed that the roommates had become a little more involved than usual, Matt and Damien especially. They would constantly check up on and keep an eye on me as I tried to recover.

I thought it was sweet at the time.

After a couple of days, I recommended that they get out of the apartment for a bit because I didn‚Äôt know if the bug I‚Äôd caught was contagious. Reluctantly, they agreed, on the condition that I would see a doctor if I still wasn‚Äôt feeling well when they got back. I agreed to their terms, deeming them as fair.

I‚Äôm glad they left when they did, because the worst of the flu or whatever I had occurred when they were gone. Nobody should‚Äôve seen me like that. My days were full of body aches, chills, and strange hallucinations. At some point though, my fever must‚Äôve broken and I instantly started to feel better, my body back on the mend.

I was in the middle of preparing a nice soup when my roommates returned home. I was feeling better, but still felt off kilter, and decided soup was just what the doctor ordered.

‚ÄúHey guys!‚Äù I greeted as the three of them came in through the front door. My tunes blasted in the kitchen as I chopped vegetables next to a boiling pot of water that was eagerly waiting to boil my chosen meat. I waved my hand that held the knife at them while wiping some sweat off my forehead with the other. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making soup, you guys want any?‚Äù

Matt dropped the grocery bag he was carrying as he saw what I was cooking. Damien‚Äôs jaw practically fell to the floor, and Sharron took a cautious step back.

‚ÄúWhat the *fuck*, Joey?!‚Äù Matt stuttered as he slowly walked through the apartment. He pushed my slightly ajar bathroom door fully open.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked defensively, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just soup!‚Äù

Damien stepped in. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an arm on that cutting board!‚Äù

I furrowed my brows in confusion, sucking some tasty vegetable juice off the tips of my fingers. I looked down. Sure enough, sitting right next to my pile of chopped celery and onions was a woman‚Äôs severed hand and forearm lying in a giant puddle of blood. Her nails had been painted a vibrant yet elegant shade of red. I pressed my lips into a thin line. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ how did that get there?‚Äù

It was then that I noticed the state of the apartment. Large brownish stains covered the living room carpet. Dry and wet blood trails littered the floors. I looked to my bathroom which Matthew had been investigating. Floating in blood and partially melted ice in my bath tub, laid the body the arm on my cutting board had belonged to. Her clouded dead eyes were staring right at me. The young lady looked familiar to me in the moment, but I didn‚Äôt know why.

Slowly, the reality of this whole situation set in. ‚ÄúW-what-?‚Äù I asked, setting my knife down with trembling hands. ‚ÄúDid I do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI- I think so,‚Äù Sharron said, eyeing me up and down. I had been wearing an apron as I cooked, which upon further notice was drenched in blood. The skin on my face, neck, and hands was caked in dried flaky brown bits. Turns out the vegetable juice on my fingers had actually been fresh blood.

Suddenly, Sharron hissed at me, her front canine teeth extending into full on fangs. Damien joined her, a low growl emanating from deep in his throat. Matthew joined in, glaring at me, frantically muttering something under his breath. Together the three of them started to close in on me, cornering me in the kitchen.

‚ÄúG-guys?‚Äù I choked out as fresh fear flooded my veins. What on Earth was going on? Matt started chanting faster and faster, my mind getting foggier as he did so. Static filled my ears as my inky black splotches started to envelop my vision. Then everything went dark.

I woke up tied tightly to a chair facing my roommates sitting across from me on the couch. The way the three of them sat there made it feel like I was on trial, sitting in front  of a jury. Which, essentially I was.

Matthew was the first one to say something. He introduced himself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Matthew Lawson, witch.‚Äù

I looked at him, dazed. Matt then prompted Damien to go next. ‚ÄúDamien Fischer, werewolf.‚Äù

Sharron went next. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sharron Ramirez, and I‚Äôm a vampire.‚Äù

I stared at them, mouth agape. ‚ÄúYou guys can‚Äôt be serious,‚Äù I laughed. Then I remembered what happened in the kitchen and my expression changed.

‚ÄúOh we‚Äôre serious,‚Äù Damien said, crossing his arms into his chest and sitting back.

‚ÄúDead serious,‚Äù Sharron added.

Matthew leaned forward, resting his fist on his chin, taking a good look at me. I flinched when he stood up, slamming my eyelids shut  thinking that would protect me from another one of his witchy attacks. Then, he did something unexpected. He untied me.

I rubbed my raw wrists gingerly as he sat back down. Then he gestured to a steaming cup of tea sitting on the coffee table between us. He motioned for me to take it.

Cautiously, I did, stealing the tiniest sip of the liquid I could get away with. The tension between the four of us grew thicker as the awkward silence stretched on.

So, that‚Äôs where me and my roommates currently stand.

Now that I knew what they were, my roommates were now demanding to know what the hell was I?

That‚Äôs a good question, because I didn‚Äôt know.",1,1728360140.0,SpnsAthenaeum,0,1.0,False

Sharron kept her room dark *dark*. The walls were painted black and most of the accents in her room were either deep shades of red or gray. She has a mini fridge under her desk, but when I saw her room for the first time, it was covered with a dark sheet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there was a pad lock keeping it shut.

Once a month, for about a week, Damien seemed to get irritated pretty easily. He also stocked up on red meats during that time, leaving the apartment in a perpetual state of smelling like a steakhouse. Then at the end of that week, Damien and Sharron would leave for a date night, not returning home until late in the evening the next day.

So, what led my roommates to reveal their true identities to me (intervention style I might add)? Well, I think it all started last week when I started developing some symptoms and feeling sick.

I let everyone know I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and would try my best to quarantine myself to my room to prevent the illness from spreading. Matt offered me a special cream, a salve I think he called it, to try to help alleviate my symptoms. I politely refused.

About mid week I noticed that the roommates had become a little more involved than usual, Matt and Damien especially. They would constantly check up on and keep an eye on me as I tried to recover.

I thought it was sweet at the time.

After a couple of days, I recommended that they get out of the apartment for a bit because I didn‚Äôt know if the bug I‚Äôd caught was contagious. Reluctantly, they agreed, on the condition that I would see a doctor if I still wasn‚Äôt feeling well when they got back. I agreed to their terms, deeming them as fair.

I‚Äôm glad they left when they did, because the worst of the flu or whatever I had occurred when they were gone. Nobody should‚Äôve seen me like that. My days were full of body aches, chills, and strange hallucinations. At some point though, my fever must‚Äôve broken and I instantly started to feel better, my body back on the mend.

I was in the middle of preparing a nice soup when my roommates returned home. I was feeling better, but still felt off kilter, and decided soup was just what the doctor ordered.

‚ÄúHey guys!‚Äù I greeted as the three of them came in through the front door. My tunes blasted in the kitchen as I chopped vegetables next to a boiling pot of water that was eagerly waiting to boil my chosen meat. I waved my hand that held the knife at them while wiping some sweat off my forehead with the other. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making soup, you guys want any?‚Äù

Matt dropped the grocery bag he was carrying as he saw what I was cooking. Damien‚Äôs jaw practically fell to the floor, and Sharron took a cautious step back.

‚ÄúWhat the *fuck*, Joey?!‚Äù Matt stuttered as he slowly walked through the apartment. He pushed my slightly ajar bathroom door fully open.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked defensively, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just soup!‚Äù

Damien stepped in. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an arm on that cutting board!‚Äù

I furrowed my brows in confusion, sucking some tasty vegetable juice off the tips of my fingers. I looked down. Sure enough, sitting right next to my pile of chopped celery and onions was a woman‚Äôs severed hand and forearm lying in a giant puddle of blood. Her nails had been painted a vibrant yet elegant shade of red. I pressed my lips into a thin line. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ how did that get there?‚Äù

It was then that I noticed the state of the apartment. Large brownish stains covered the living room carpet. Dry and wet blood trails littered the floors. I looked to my bathroom which Matthew had been investigating. Floating in blood and partially melted ice in my bath tub, laid the body the arm on my cutting board had belonged to. Her clouded dead eyes were staring right at me. The young lady looked familiar to me in the moment, but I didn‚Äôt know why.

Slowly, the reality of this whole situation set in. ‚ÄúW-what-?‚Äù I asked, setting my knife down with trembling hands. ‚ÄúDid I do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI- I think so,‚Äù Sharron said, eyeing me up and down. I had been wearing an apron as I cooked, which upon further notice was drenched in blood. The skin on my face, neck, and hands was caked in dried flaky brown bits. Turns out the vegetable juice on my fingers had actually been fresh blood.

Suddenly, Sharron hissed at me, her front canine teeth extending into full on fangs. Damien joined her, a low growl emanating from deep in his throat. Matthew joined in, glaring at me, frantically muttering something under his breath. Together the three of them started to close in on me, cornering me in the kitchen.

‚ÄúG-guys?‚Äù I choked out as fresh fear flooded my veins. What on Earth was going on? Matt started chanting faster and faster, my mind getting foggier as he did so. Static filled my ears as my inky black splotches started to envelop my vision. Then everything went dark.

I woke up tied tightly to a chair facing my roommates sitting across from me on the couch. The way the three of them sat there made it feel like I was on trial, sitting in front  of a jury. Which, essentially I was.

Matthew was the first one to say something. He introduced himself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Matthew Lawson, witch.‚Äù

I looked at him, dazed. Matt then prompted Damien to go next. ‚ÄúDamien Fischer, werewolf.‚Äù

Sharron went next. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sharron Ramirez, and I‚Äôm a vampire.‚Äù

I stared at them, mouth agape. ‚ÄúYou guys can‚Äôt be serious,‚Äù I laughed. Then I remembered what happened in the kitchen and my expression changed.

‚ÄúOh we‚Äôre serious,‚Äù Damien said, crossing his arms into his chest and sitting back.

‚ÄúDead serious,‚Äù Sharron added.

Matthew leaned forward, resting his fist on his chin, taking a good look at me. I flinched when he stood up, slamming my eyelids shut  thinking that would protect me from another one of his witchy attacks. Then, he did something unexpected. He untied me.

I rubbed my raw wrists gingerly as he sat back down. Then he gestured to a steaming cup of tea sitting on the coffee table between us. He motioned for me to take it.

Cautiously, I did, stealing the tiniest sip of the liquid I could get away with. The tension between the four of us grew thicker as the awkward silence stretched on.

So, that‚Äôs where me and my roommates currently stand.

Now that I knew what they were, my roommates were now demanding to know what the hell was I?

1fyr4ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fyr4ao/so_it_turns_out_my_roommates_are_monsters/,"So, It Turns Out My Roommates Are Monsters‚Ä¶","A vampire, a witch, and a werewolf. Seems like the set up for a bad joke am I right?

Well, as it turns out, my whole life is just one bad joke. Because as my luck would have it, my roommates Matthew, Sharron, and Damien are literal, honest to god, *monsters.*

Matthew is a witch, Sharron is a vampire, and her boyfriend Damien is a werewolf. I‚Äôve been living with these people for literal months and they chose *now* to tell me the truth?!?

Okay, let me back track and explain to you how I ended up in this situation.

A couple months back I hit a rough patch in my life. It was the off season at work so my hours had been cut (I work at a themed cafe). And then my girlfriend cheated on me and kicked me out of the house, essentially leaving me homeless. I was depressed and desperately in need of a new place to live, so I did the stupid thing and browsed roommate wanted ads on Craigslist. Theirs was the first one I clicked on.

Botta-bing, botta-boom, next thing you know, the four of us were meeting up at a local restaurant to discuss my possible tenancy.

They had their reservations about me at first, as did I them. I mean I answered their *craigslist* ad for crying out loud! That‚Äôs gotta be suspicious to someone considering the site‚Äôs historic link to some of the most gruesome true crime cases in this century. Then again, they did put the ad on the site to begin with so‚Ä¶ hence the meeting.

Well, my first red flag should‚Äôve been that we met up at night. I guess since it wasn‚Äôt too late in the evening when we met (around seven pm) and was in a fairly public place, I thought nothing of it.

After meeting up and getting the pleasantries out of the way we started introducing ourselves. I told them my tale, mostly trying to earn pity points so they‚Äôd let me crash with them- which I think worked pretty well considering I ended up moving in.

Mathew went next. He was an above average looking guy with blonde hair, blue eyes, average height. Pretty normal and unsuspecting looking. I learned he worked as an anesthesiologist assistant and spent his free time either at the library or reading in his room.

It was obvious Sharron and Damien were a couple based on the fact they sat together, were holding hands, and stared at each other with lovey-dovey eyes. They looked like complete opposites to each other.

Sharron definitely fit the goth esthetic with the pasty white skin, long silky black hair, and the signature red lip. Though she looked young, she carried herself with this ‚Äòwise beyond her years‚Äô confidence.

Damien, on the other hand, was a tall and stalky black man with thick dreads and a goatee. Despite his intimidating physical appearance, he wore a green and white flannel button up with grey khakis, was very nice, and actually seemed quite timid giving off mega nerd vibes.

Sharron was definitely the dominant one in the relationship.

Turns out Sharron worked nights at a gas station not too far from the apartment and Damien worked from home doing IT work. See, told you, *nerd.* Or maybe the correct technical term is geek? I dunno.

All in all, everyone seemed to be pretty chill. But, I should‚Äôve known something was off with the three of them as soon as we placed our orders. Working in food service, I‚Äôve learned you can tell a lot about a person by the food they eat.

Sharron only ordered a coffee. At seven pm. *clearly* she had some kind of eating disorder or special diet. (Little did I know how right I was about that). Matthew skipped right past the appetizers and entrees, immediately ordering a chocolate cake type dessert. Weird, but not totally eccentric. Damien‚Äôs order was normal enough, a porterhouse steak bloody rare. The look that shone in his eyes as soon as it was set down on the table almost unsettled me though.

I ordered buttered noodles and chicken tenders since I‚Äôm a picky eater, so I couldn‚Äôt really say shit, and I didn‚Äôt. We ate dinner in between polite small talk before we got down to it.

They were looking for a serious roommate. Someone who paid rent on time, helped with groceries, all that. Specifically, they wanted someone who could be trusted, someone who wasn‚Äôt loud and could keep to themselves. Someone peaceful and unproblematic. Something their last roommate apparently hadn‚Äôt been.

I reassured them that would be me or at least I would try my best to be. They bought it and invited me over for a tour of the apartment the next day.

Apartment four-thirteen. It was the thirteenth, and largest, unit on the fourth floor. It was a four bed three bath with about two-thousand square feet. Matthew had the master, and despite being together, Damien and Sharron had their own rooms, but shared a connected bathroom. I would take the empty room, which was the smallest, and have my own bathroom. The communal spaces were the large living room that had floor to ceiling stain glass windows and the decently sized kitchen. Rent was nine-seventy five, bills were separate, all due by the fifth of the month. *And* my commute to work would be easier there. Honestly, it was a pretty sweet deal that I just couldn‚Äôt pass up.

After they gave me a final offer and we got the lease all settled, I was moved in by the end of the week.

Now, you might be asking yourselves, ‚ÄúJoey, how did you not realize there was something *off* about your roommates?‚Äù

Well, to be honest with you, everything was going so well those first couple months I didn‚Äôt really notice. Mostly because everyone‚Äôs hectic schedules prevented all of us from being in the apartment at the same time for an extended period.

I work all kinds of crazy hours at the cafe during the day so I was in and out of the apartment sporadically. Since Sharron worked nights the most I saw of her was when she came home in the morning and when she left for work at night. Matt was pretty much always at the hospital or the library. Damien stayed in his room all the time playing video games and doing his IT work.

When all of us *were* home, we pretty much just stayed confined to our personal spaces. Looking back on it, now knowing the truth, there were some signs.

Matthew had a full on garden growing in his room and so many candles that even candle hoarders would deem that many as too much. He also always seemed to have a homemade remedy at the ready for any injury or problem that could arise.

Sharron kept her room dark *dark*. The walls were painted black and most of the accents in her room were either deep shades of red or gray. She has a mini fridge under her desk, but when I saw her room for the first time, it was covered with a dark sheet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there was a pad lock keeping it shut.

I am beyond exhausted for being responsible for untangling my spouse‚Äôs emotions. It‚Äôs my own fault as I seem to only pick ‚Äúfixer-uppers‚Äù historically. While I‚Äôm no martyr and I carry my own (heavy) baggage, I‚Äôve taken on the responsibility to unpack it and understand why it‚Äôs there. Every time I meet a man, I somehow become the archeologist in their repressed emotions burial ground. I call it ‚Äúfeeling for two‚Äù. 
It‚Äôs a personal view of mine that in a man + woman relationships, the woman is more responsible for tuning into the energy of the relationship more than the man- and I‚Äôm okay with that. But now? 2 fails later? After finally thinking I met the right man? I want to throw my head through a brick wall. 
I try my damndest to really understand and talk him through it. Think of a way to help your partner when they are feeling down- I‚Äôve tried it. Explained how I was in his exact shoes years ago, and how nobody helped me the way I‚Äôm helping him so I want him to feel all the support in the world from me. It‚Äôs like talking to empty space. The occasional (prompted) ‚Äúyea‚Äù but nothing of actual meaning. And I mean nothing. ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù is genuinely all I get. 
Part of me is selfish, wanting to be able to have introspective conversations and grow and learn together. Part of me resents that I can show my love this much but he‚Äôs ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù throughout the day or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt think to‚Äù send me a text saying he loves me or is thinking of me. Surprises, notes, coffee, ‚Äújust because I though of you at the store‚Äù things, date nights I don‚Äôt plan, outings I don‚Äôt coordinate, dumb couples games, candids I don‚Äôt take, pictures I don‚Äôt ask for, social media posts I don‚Äôt request, tailored gifts just for me because he knows me so well- things I have communicated so clearly. Needs unmet and expectations dropped that make being his emotional archeologist exhausting. 
I love him so much. I love him inside and out and I meant every word in those vows. I‚Äôm just out of gas. I don‚Äôt like sharing these incredibly personal details to friends or family because I do truly believe some things are between you, your partner, and God (and a couples counselor) but I really need to just ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù.

Introduced to me during a¬†**woodworking class**¬†by a crusty old craftsman whose hands told stories of a lifetime shaping wood,¬†**Ted‚Äôs Woodworking**¬†was positioned as a goldmine, and honestly, it hasn‚Äôt disappointed. With 16,000 plans crowding my workbench, it transformed my hobbyist fumbles into confident strokes. So, let‚Äôs get our hands dusty as we sift through what Ted McGrath‚Äôs brainchild offers.

From the onset,¬†**Ted‚Äôs Woodworking**¬†seemed to promise a remedy for every woodworker‚Äôs headache: the scourge of incomplete instructions and vague diagrams that could turn even the simplest birdhouse project into a complex puzzle. Ted, armed with experience and the aim to democratize¬†**woodworking**, offered up his life‚Äôs work as the antidote ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a potent one at that.

Diving through the 16,000¬†**plans**¬†is like an archaeological dig into the essence of¬†**woodworking**. There‚Äôs a delicious array of everything from quaint coffee tables and sturdy bookshelves to elaborate cribs ‚Äî not your average run-of-the-mill patterns either. Each project is a page-turner, brimming with the exactitudes of a true craftsman‚Äôs touch. You get a vivid sense of Ted with every detailed schematic, each cut list, every smooth line in the illustrative blueprints.

Wandering through the tutorials, I find myself lost in a¬†**woodworking wonderland**. It‚Äôs more than instructions; it‚Äôs an experience crafted to ignite a woodworker‚Äôs zeal. High on practical wisdom, low on fluff ‚Äî the visuals clarify, the text guides, and with each chip of wood, my confidence builds.

The platform itself is akin to walking into a well-organized workshop. It‚Äôs an intuitive space ‚Äî search a project genre, pick your¬†**woodworking dare**, and off you go. Every digital aisle leads to somewhere intriguing. Even better, there are video tutorials, an absolute boon for those, like me, who sometimes struggle to translate text to tangible action.

But¬†**Ted‚Äôs Woodworking**¬†isn‚Äôt just about building ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building right. The compendium almost becomes a mentor, schooling you in the delicate art of wood selection, the nuances of joinery, and the little secrets that elevate a project. Ted, it seems, is intent on making craftsmen out of all of us.

Even the customer support reflects the ethos of the¬†**woodworking community**: robust, reliable, ready to lend a hand. Every query is met with the patience and understanding deserving of a fellow wood lover ‚Äî because isn‚Äôt that at the heart of¬†**woodworking**? The connection of kindred spirits.

Having Wilson with us stopped more of the patients from trying to kill me every time they didn‚Äôt get what they wanted. But I felt as if I was constantly walking on eggshells around him. He‚Äôs so cheery and friendly towards me and Rachel that I sometimes forget about what he is. But sometimes when it gets a little too hot in the office I notice that he starts to melt a bit. It was my idea to keep the waiting room at a cool 50 degrees to stop him from melting. The patients might complain a bit, but honestly, as long as it keeps Wilson from turning into a goop monster again, I‚Äôm all for it.¬†



I came into work the other day dressed in a cozy sweater so that I didn‚Äôt catch a cold in our freezing waiting room. I smiled and waved at Wilson when I opened the door to the waiting room and saw him standing dutifully at his post. His cheer is infectious at times, and I can‚Äôt help but smile back at him. He doesn‚Äôt seem ever to leave the waiting room, so I have to imagine that he just stands at his post the entire night. Props to him for his dedication!¬†



Sitting down at my desk I noticed that I had much less paperwork than normal. Pulling up the schedule for today I was surprised to see that only four patients were planned for today. I‚Äôve worked here for almost an entire year and I‚Äôve never seen Dr. Harrison have less than fifteen patients minimum. My first assumption was that it must have been some sort of mistake and that maybe my calendar was wrong.¬†



‚ÄúHey, lardass,‚Äù I turned over to see Rachel standing at my desk with her arms crossed and her usual bitchy expression staring at me. ‚ÄúAnything wrong with Wilson today?‚Äù she asked me as she tapped her finger impatiently against her arm. I looked over at Wilson, who had heard his name and was looking back over at us.¬†



‚ÄúBesides never leaving that post? Nah he‚Äôs fine.‚Äù I told her. I wanted to talk shit to her but my curiosity took precedence over my pettiness. ‚ÄúWhy does Dr. Harrison only have four patients today?‚Äù I asked her. She looked at me with surprise and then I showed her the schedule for today.¬†



‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs today?‚Äù she asked as she yanked the sheet of paper away from me to examine it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing you should concern yourself with. These are just real important patients that need his full attention.‚Äù She tossed the schedule back at me and walked away, leaving me in a huff and with an itch of curiosity. So I decided to wait for him. It was another rare moment of him being late again, so I was worried something had happened to him.¬†



Dr. Harrison arrived close to opening time, and it was obvious to me that he wasn‚Äôt holding up so well. Ever since having to call whoever that old rotary phone was connected to, he had been in a deep depression. He approached my desk and gave me a half-hearted smile, but I could tell that he was still upset. The look in his eyes was enough to show me that. His beautiful green eyes didn‚Äôt have the shine that they once had.¬†



‚ÄúHey, doc. Can I get you anything to cheer you up?‚Äù I asked him, worried that he might mess up a surgery in his current state. He looked at me and shook his head before staring down at the schedule laid before him.¬†



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs today, huh?‚Äù He sighed and pushed his glasses up to rub the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúDo me a favor, Maggie.‚Äù He started telling me, placing his glasses back into place. ‚ÄúThe third patient that‚Äôs going to show up today, do your best not to interact with him too much. He can be, a little much.‚Äù He told me, grabbing the papers I handed him and making his way back into the back hallways toward the ORs and consultation rooms.¬†



I let out a sigh as I started working on my few pieces of paperwork. When the doors opened, I was surprised to see that a flood of patients didn‚Äôt come rushing in as they normally did. I looked over at Wilson to see if he was as confused as I was, but the blank look on his face with a smile on his face proved to me that he probably wasn‚Äôt thinking about much. I wheeled my chair over to the computer and decided to check something. A quick search showed me why there wasn‚Äôt anybody showing up today. Our clinic showed up as closed.¬†



It was probably the easiest day of work I‚Äôve had since I started working here. To the point that I was even able to start reading a book, I had brought on my first day of work, thinking that I would actually have time to read it. Of course though, the moment I turned the first page the front door opened and I heard long heels clicking against our floors. I let out an annoyed exhale as I looked up from my book and quickly dropped it to the floor.¬†



In all my time working here, I‚Äôve seen some people who are clearly addicted to plastic surgery. The kind that you immediately think of when you think of the phrase botched surgery. But this woman was the poster child of botched surgery. Her skin was pulled tight against her skull and was so thin that I thought any little cut to her skin would cause it to snap off her skull. Not to mention she looked like her face was made completely of plastic.¬†



‚ÄúI have arrived,‚Äù she said, with all the superiority that someone like she imagined herself to have. ‚ÄúOh God, has Dr. Harrison gotten desperate enough to hire pigs as his receptionist?‚Äù She scoffed when she laid eyes on me. I had to physically bite my tongue to stop myself from saying anything to her back.¬†



‚ÄúHello, ma‚Äôam. Dr. Harrison should be all ready for you, so you can go right ahead!‚Äù I told her in my best customer service voice, all the while scratching at my hand to stop it from wanting to punch her right in her stupid plastic face. She snuffed and walked towards the door that led to the rooms. Once she had finally left my sight and I heard the clicking of her heels retreat into one of the nearby rooms I let out a long and annoyed sigh and picked my book up from the floor. It immediately returned to the floor when I looked up and saw yet another patient waiting for me. He was just as plastic looking as the woman was. Lucky for me he wasn‚Äôt as big of an asshole as the woman had been. In fact, he was perfectly silent.¬†



‚ÄúYou can go right ahead, sir. Dr. Harrison should be with you shortly.‚Äù I told him. He nodded at me and started walking. It seemed like he could barely move his body, it looked like he was a living action figure with how he was moving. I watched him and shook my head, starting to question why I had decided to stay here.¬†



I gave up on reading the book and instead decided to just double-check all the paperwork I had done that day. Which took only a few minutes, and I found myself missing the endless rush of patients. Of course not the crazies but for them I had Wilson standing nearby. This time I was able to see the next patient enter the waiting room. He wasn‚Äôt like the previous two who had dressed like they were about to have a photo shoot afterward.¬†



He was dressed in a dirty hoodie and sweatpants, a face mask covering the lower part of his face, and his hands were planted firmly in his hoodie pockets. He approached the desk and stared at me with cold brown eyes, that just seemed hollow. Like there was no life behind them at all. I thought for a moment that maybe he was some junkie who was planning to rob the clinic or something, but with Wilson close at hand I held off any accusations.¬†



‚ÄúHello, sir. Do you have an appointment today?‚Äù I asked him, mostly for verification. He stared at me with those hollow eyes and I began to get uncomfortable with just how intently he was staring at me. I reached under my desk to get my pepper spray, but as I did he cleared his throat.¬†



‚ÄúYea. It‚Äôs under Spencer,‚Äù he told me. Even his voice gave me uncanny feelings. It sounded like the recording of a voice. I wondered if that was his last name or first. I looked over at my monitor and was surprised to see an appointment just under the name Spencer. That was it. I clicked on his name to see if he had insurance or anything at all like that. There was nothing under his name, just his name, and that he had an appointment at this time.¬†



‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶‚Äù I said as I took a look at him. While he was wearing a hoodie, his hood wasn‚Äôt up and he had a tangled mass of brown hair on his head. I drummed my fingers on the table as I kept looking at his sparse records. Should I just let him through, I thought to myself. I decided I needed confirmation before I was going to allow him into the clinic. ‚ÄúCan you just have a seat? I just need to have a quick word with Dr. Harrison. It shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes.‚Äù I said, giving him the best fake smile I could.¬†



He stared at me for a couple of seconds before looking over at the row of seats available to him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take too long.‚Äù He told me as he turned and walked over to a nearby seat. I nodded at him and quickly stood up from my chair, and glanced over at Wilson. He had his eyes securely trained on Spencer and I was assured enough to go and ask Dr. Harrison. Walking over to the first OR room I didn‚Äôt hear any sounds coming from inside, so I knocked before just barging in unannounced.¬†



‚ÄúDr. Harrison? I need to ask you something.‚Äù I told him through the door as I backed up enough to let the door swing open. It took a few moments, enough time elapsed to where I thought he hadn‚Äôt heard me. But just as I was about to knock again, the door slowly opened and Rachel stuck her head out.¬†



‚ÄúWhat do you want, fatass? We‚Äôre in the middle of surgery.‚Äù She scolded me from behind her face mask. I sighed and brushed past her annoying comment.¬†



‚ÄúThat Spencer guy is here. And I wanted to know if I should admit him. He seems really sketchy.‚Äù I told her, glancing back toward my desk just to make sure he wasn‚Äôt spying on me or anything. Rachel rolled her eyes at me and pulled her mask down.¬†



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôre interrupting us for? Yes, let that asshole in. And don‚Äôt let him touch any of the equipment.‚Äù Before I could ask any other follow-up question the door was slammed in my face.¬†



‚ÄúDumb bitch,‚Äù I hissed at her and turned to return to my desk. I took a quick seat and made sure that Wilson hadn‚Äôt torn Spencer to shreds. Seeing that he was still sitting where he was I motioned for him to come up to the desk. Hands still in his hoodie pocket he stood up from his seat and walked over to me. ‚ÄúYou can go right ahead, sir. Dr. Harrison did ask for you not to touch any of our equipment.‚Äù I told him, ignoring the fact that Rachel had told me that.¬†



‚ÄúYeah, yeah, as long as he fixes me,‚Äù Spencer said as he walked over to the door and entered into the hallway towards the OR. Leaning back in my chair I looked over at the clock and groaned when I realized that only an hour and a half had passed since we opened. Just as I was about to try reading that book again I heard a loud snap coming from the lost and found box.



‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù I shouted triumphantly as I quickly wheeled over to inspect the mouse trap I had left inside the lost and found. I figured that maybe a rat or mouse had been getting into the box and stealing things to make a nest or something out of it. I peeked into the box and was immediately surprised to see that nothing had been caught. The trap hadn‚Äôt gone off accidentally though, as the cheese I had used as bait had been stolen. ‚ÄúSmart mouse‚Ä¶‚Äù I hissed, making a mental note to get more traps on my way home from work.¬†



As I was contemplating ways to catch this mystery creature that was stealing from the lost and found a loud screech ripped through the entire clinic. Followed quickly afterward by Rachel‚Äôs screaming. Standing up quickly from my chair I looked over at Wilson who had also looked on in confusion over what was going on. He quickly left his post and entered the door towards the hallway. I followed after him, making my way to the back of the receptionist area that led into the same hallway.¬†



Wilson was trying to enter the OR where Dr. Harrison and Rachel were, but the door was locked. He looked slightly confused like he‚Äôd never come across a situation like this before. Before he could figure out how to open the door, it flew off its hinges and set him flying into the wall, a sickening crunch and splat sounded out as Wilson was splattered against the wall like a mosquito.¬†



Quickly afterward, Rachel came sprinting out of the room and towards me, not even insulting me as she grabbed me by the arm and started running with me in tow. This so took me aback that I didn‚Äôt even know what we were running from. But I heard loud screeching behind us, and I ventured a look behind us to see what it was. And was immediately regretful that I did. Chasing after us was the upper torso of the woman. Her spinal cord had turned into a long tail and her ribs were serving as legs propelling her along with her elongated arms.¬†



‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?!‚Äù I screamed at Rachel as we rushed into the nearby OR room and quickly slammed the door behind us. We both pressed ourselves against the door to stop the monster from getting through the door. It slammed itself against the door and broke the top hinge, but failed to bust down the door. After a few more attempts the monster screeched at us and we heard it drag itself across the floor towards the nearby rooms.¬†



‚ÄúThank God, your fatass was actually useful in this situation,‚Äù Rachel said through haggard breaths. She looked at me just in time for me to slap her across the face as hard as I physically could. I slapped her so hard, I knocked her head into the door and dazed her something fierce.¬†



‚ÄúShut up you dumb bitch! What the fuck was that thing?!‚Äù I demanded to know from her. Grabbing her by the collar of her scrubs and shaking her back and forth. ‚ÄúQuit calling me names and answer me you dumb cu-‚Äù Before I could further swear at her, someone in the room cleared his throat and pulled both of our attentions to him.¬†



‚ÄúCan you guys take this somewhere else?‚Äù Spencer asked us as he smacked a pack of cigarettes against his gloved hands. He had surgical gloves over his hands and I recognized them as the ones we had at the office.¬†



‚ÄúY-you can‚Äôt smoke in here,‚Äù I told him, tossing Rachel away like she was a sack of potatoes and looking over at Spencer as he laughed at me. ‚ÄúOne, this is a doctor‚Äôs office and two smoking is bad for you.‚Äù I was in total mom mode since I hate people who smoke. It‚Äôs a nasty gross habit, and it's probably the biggest waste of money I can think of. Tangent aside, Spencer continued to laugh at me.¬†



‚ÄúLady, at this point in my life, smoking is the least horrible thing I‚Äôve done to myself.‚Äù He reached his hand up to pull down his facial mask and I was horrified to see that the lower half of his face was completely skeletal. His nose was gone and replaced with the holes where it should have been. He flicked the box of cigarettes up and got one to stick out of the box. He leaned down and placed it between his teeth before he fished out a lighter from his pocket.¬†



‚ÄúYou lost more skin, you freak?‚Äù Rachel asked as she walked over, blood streaming from her forehead from where she‚Äôd landed after my smack had slammed her head against the door. ‚ÄúDr. Harrison told you to stop testing on yourself.‚Äù She scolded, before looking over at me and tsking in anger at the fact I had fought back against her.¬†



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember him telling me that. All I remember is him saying that I should stop testing on myself. Not that I have to.‚Äù Spencer chuckled as he lit his cigarette and began to take a deep drag of it. The smoke billowed from his jaw and his missing nose. Too grossed out to keep looking at him, I turned away and stared at Rachel.¬†



‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that thing?‚Äù I asked her again. She looked over at me and rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúEither you tell me, or I‚Äôm smacking you again,‚Äù I warned her, and judging by her reaction she wasn‚Äôt too keen on that option.¬†



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the patient. Something went wrong and Dr. Harrison lost control of her. And well‚Ä¶she turned into that thing.‚Äù She sighed as she crossed her arms at me. ‚ÄúShe whipped Dr. Harrison with her tail and knocked him out cold.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúHow the hell does she turn into that after a simple surgery?‚Äù I asked her, Spencer letting out another laugh, clearly enjoying all this.¬†



‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsimple surgery‚Äô. The three patients besides this jackass,‚Äù She motioned at Spencer who waved at the two of us. ‚ÄúAre meant to provide Dr. Harrison with more skin, and in turn get their skin replaced with silicone and plastic. He‚Äôs done this hundreds of times and this is the first time something like this has happened,‚Äù ahe told me, walking over to the medical cabinet in the room and opening it with her key.¬†



‚ÄúWhy would Dr. Harrison need skin for?‚Äù I asked her, Spencer let out some more chuckles as smoke poured out of the crevasses in his exposed skull. Rachel ignored my question as she pulled out a few vials of morphine and placed them on the counter just under the medical cabinet.¬†



‚ÄúFor me? You shouldn‚Äôt have Rachel.‚Äù Spencer said with fake surprise, it was then that I noticed that even without opening and closing his mouth he was able to talk at the same volume and with the same clarity as if he wasn‚Äôt smoking a cigarette.¬†



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for you jackass. It‚Äôs to sedate that thing outside,‚Äù she said, quickly checking the cabinets for any syringes. But she quickly came up empty, the entire room had been completely cleaned of syringes. ‚ÄúGive them back.‚Äù She ordered. I thought she was talking about me, but then her accusatory gaze turned to Spencer who was staring up at the ceiling.¬†



‚ÄúYou gotta fix that lightbulb,‚Äù he said as Rachel walked over and grabbed him by the hoodie strings. Almost as quickly as she did, however, Spencer pulled a gun out and pointed it straight at Rachel‚Äôs forehead. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me,‚Äù he ordered, and Rachel quickly let him go.¬†



‚ÄúYou had a gun the whole time?!‚Äù I asked him incredulously, which quickly turned to fear as he turned the gun on me. ‚ÄúW-who are you?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúMe and Dr. Harrison have an understanding. He stops my skin from falling off any further, and I keep him well supplied with whatever medications he needs to run the clinic. Simple business.‚Äù He took one last full puff of the cigarette and allowed it to drop to the floor, crushing it under his foot.¬†



‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt fix your skin if he‚Äôs dead, idiot,‚Äù Rachel told him, still insulting the man who had a gun trained on her. He looked over to her and then back at me before letting out an annoyed sigh. He lowered his gun and reached into his pockets, pulling out a couple of syringes.¬†



‚ÄúHow deep are those pockets?‚Äù I asked him, he looked over at me and I could just tell that if he had the ability to smile he would‚Äôve been.¬†



‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you like to know?‚Äù He snorted as he handed the syringes to Rachel. ‚ÄúJust dope that thing up and I‚Äôll finish her off with this.‚Äù He reached back into his pockets and pulled out a syringe filled with what looked like blue glowstick fluid. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask what it is, 'cause I‚Äôm not answering that.‚Äù He told me before I could even get the thought into my head.



Rachel picked up the vials of morphine and started filling a couple of the syringes with it. She walked over to me and I half expected her to stick me with one of the needles but instead, she handed me one.¬†



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me regret this,‚Äù she said, walking over to the door and cracking it open slightly. Spencer joined us at the door as he pulled his face mask back on and joined us out in the hallway. It wasn‚Äôt too hard to find the creature since it/she was currently busy eating the second patient who had arrived today.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù I whispered. Watching as the monster chowed down on the poor man. He was a mangled heap of meat and plastic by the look of things. What was more horrifying was the fact that the creature was using his arms. Somehow it had just ripped them off from the joint and had placed them just below her own arms. Before I could take even more in of the monster, my ears began ringing with pain. I looked over at Spencer and my eyes went wide when I saw that he had simply pulled his gun out and shot the creature.¬†



‚ÄúThat oughta do it,‚Äù Spencer said as he waited for the creature. It screeched at the three of us, and left its meal alone, before pouncing towards us. Just as it was about to pounce on us and most likely rip us to shreds, something slammed us out of the way. I landed on top of Rachel and Spencer landed next to me. I looked over and was delighted to see that Wilson was holding the thrashing and screaming monster. He looked a little worse for wear, sort of like a melted wax statue, but he still had all that strength.¬†



Rachel mumbled and screamed from under me, and I climbed off of her. I could tell that she just wanted to yell at me but she let it slide for now. We didn‚Äôt even need to use the morphine, as Wilson finally managed to hold the monster still. Spencer simply walked up to the creature and plunged his syringe of glowing blue liquid into the monster. As soon as he walked away from it, it calmed down almost immediately. And then shortly after it began to dissolve and melt into a steaming pile of bones, guts, and god knows what. All of that was too much for me and it made me throw up, on Rachel‚Äôs shoes again.¬†



‚ÄúGod damn it! Not again!‚Äù She screamed. Before the two of us could start fighting each other again, Spencer loudly cleared his throat to pull our attention over to him.¬†



‚ÄúYou should probably check on the doc. I‚Äôll be in my operating room if ya need me,‚Äù he told us as he walked past us. As he did he, reached down and picked up the syringes of morphine that Rachel had dropped when I had thrown up on her shoes. Wordlessly he plucked the syringe from me and walked away toward his room. I was blown away by just how calm this skeletal man was about this entire situation. I was just barely able to wrap my head around all this. But we quickly went to check on Dr. Harrison. Lucky for him the monster didn‚Äôt seem to show much attention to him, and we found him unconscious lying against the wall where the creature had tossed him.¬†



I wanted to help, but Rachel took one look at him and quickly shooed me away. She ordered me to man the front desk, and more importantly, call the person on the other end of the rotary phone and request his assistance. I was about to bitch at her, but I could tell that she didn‚Äôt need my help. So I made myself useful and returned to my desk. I didn‚Äôt exactly have a number for the person so I scratched my head trying to figure out how to call the person.¬†



‚ÄúJust tap on it,‚Äù Spencer told me as he leaned against the entrance of my reception area. I looked over at him in confusion. In my mind, I was thinking I was going to have to tap it on the side or something. He noticed I was struggling with his instructions he sighed in annoyance and showed me how to do it. He lifted the receiver from the phone and tapped on the cradle that had been holding it. I mentally slapped my forehead and walked over to take the phone from him.¬†



The phone rang for a few seconds before I heard a click followed by crackling. I thought that it was going to be like talking through a tin can but the voice that came through on the phone was loud and clear.¬†



‚ÄúJames, what is it? Don‚Äôt tell me Spencer is getting into trouble again.‚Äù The voice on the other end of the phone sounded incredibly posh, like someone out of an old movie from the 30s. It took me a moment to even figure out what to tell him.¬†



‚ÄúUm, hello sir. This is Maggie, his receptionist. I need your help.‚Äù I told him. He didn‚Äôt say anything for a few seconds. He wasn‚Äôt expecting my voice to be on the other side of the phone. I could hear a loud long sigh from him, and I could just tell he was rubbing his eyes.¬†



‚ÄúWhat happened this time?‚Äù he asked, his posh voice clearly annoyed by this. I did my best to get him up to speed. He didn‚Äôt say much but did ask me a few questions for clarification. He told me that he would handle all of it and that I was to tell James (Dr. Harrison) that he should expect a visit from him soon. And with that, he hung up on me. I relayed this information to Rachel, she had laid Dr. Harrison down on an operation table and was tending to him.¬†



‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt going to take the news well.‚Äù She sighed, rubbing her eyes and looking back at me. ‚ÄúYou should probably actually close the clinic for today. This whole thing has gone tits up.‚Äù She sighed, shooing me away and going back to take care of Dr. Harrison.¬†



About an hour later I was getting ready to leave when I heard Rachel talking with someone. I assumed that Dr. Harrison was awake now. I walked to the entrance of the hallway and did my best to listen. But their voices were too muffled and I couldn‚Äôt make anything out. Rachel left the room and walked past me to check up on Spencer. I took this opportunity to walk over to check on Dr. Harrison.¬†



I carefully opened the door and poked my head into the room. Dr. Harrison had his face in his hands and was upset over everything. I was about to fully enter the room when suddenly he started laughing. Slowly at first but it picked up in intensity. He walked over to the mirror in the room and stared at himself. His laughter picked up as he reached up to grab his face. I saw from his reflection that a piece of his skin was hanging off from the bridge of his nose. And to my horror, he grabbed that piece of skin and began peeling it off of his face. I covered my mouth as I stared at him continuing to tear his face off, his laughter picking up in intensity as he stared at himself in the mirror. Blood started to leak down from his exposed skin.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Rachel asked me, I quickly pulled my head out of the door and quickly pointed into the room. Rachel rolled her eyes and then poked her head into the room. And she quickly gasped and rushed into the room. ‚ÄúJames, no! Stop that!‚Äù She shouted, slamming the door behind me and leaving me in the hallway as Dr. Harrison‚Äôs cackling picked up in intensity and volume.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and quickly ran from the clinic. I nearly forgot my things from how quickly I fled. I haven‚Äôt been back for a couple of days and I‚Äôm seriously considering quitting. All of this shit is not worth the paycheck, especially if I‚Äôm in danger of getting hurt or killed. I was nearly about to call the office with my resignation when I got a call first from Dr. Harrison.¬†



Inviting me on a coffee date to explain everything. ¬†

1fyqwfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fyqwfg/how_do_you_move_on_when_youre_living_in_your/,How do you move on when you‚Äôre living in your mistake everyday?,"I know the title sounds a bit morbid but it‚Äôs my reality unfortunately.

Around this time last year, i was in a relationship with a woman i loved more than life itself. Unfortunately i found out i had HSV2. I disclosed to her and as you can imagine it didn‚Äôt go well. Thankfully she didn‚Äôt have it. She happens to be a social media star (millions of followers across all platforms) which is great for her but sucked for me because it wasn‚Äôt a regular breakup. I had to watch her make content and tweets liked and shared by millions of people about how much she hates her ex and regrets being with her ex‚Ä¶ the classic ‚Äúhate your ex‚Äù trope. 

Thankfully she didn‚Äôt call me out by name, but this experience changed me. It‚Äôs surreal to have someone you loved so much instantly be disgusted by you, from something you can‚Äôt get rid off. I don‚Äôt blame her, i didn‚Äôt want to get in the way of her career but it hurt more than anything i had experienced before. 

Anyway, of course I‚Äôm haunted by this daily. The pain feels as fresh as it was a year ago. My existence is a reminder in itself of my mistakes.  

It changed the course of my life. I was an aspiring creative, making clothes and content and building a foundation to make a living of my passion, but this ruined my self confidence, this obliterated my aspirations to be known or recognized. Luckily i was smart enough to get a decent corporate job after graduating, but as a creative at heart a 9-5 Is withering my soul. It‚Äôs been a year since i‚Äôve put out new clothes, i get messages weekly asking when i‚Äôm going to drop again and what happened to me. Friends don‚Äôt see me out anymore, my social media went private. My business page has been inactive. I‚Äôm a dead man walking really. Nothing excites me or motivates but the thought of dying. I feel absolutely nothing.

Life is agony, because i live in my mistake. Existence hurts. I was building towards my dreams and building a successful business from my passion alongside a successful partner who truly loved me, and now i‚Äôm about to turn 22 barely making ends meet living paycheck to paycheck working a corporate 9-5 where It‚Äôd take me a couple decades to climb the ladder in this stupid rat race while i feel the pain just as intensely daily. I have nightmares every night of being chased or dying and pain in one form or another. To the point where i expect it.

I don‚Äôt even know if i‚Äôm here for advice really,  nothing can save me at this point but finally ending the cycle. This was more so to vent as I prepare for work tomorrow. Another day of corporate small talk, coffee and micro aggression as part of this meaningless life.

I apologize if my pain is upsetting, i hope if you haven‚Äôt made my mistake or anything similar you can learn from it so you don‚Äôt ruin your life. If you‚Äôre reading this cherish your loved ones, use protection and follow your dreams. Please!

1fyqtgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1fyqtgb/the_tunnels/,The Tunnels,"Hi guys, my best friend went missing on a road trip and I am trying to find him. We‚Äôre part way through summer and he hasn‚Äôt come back in a month and a half. He wont answer his texts, location services are off. Ever since middle school Us three have been inseparable and I can‚Äôt shake this nagging feeling something bad must have happened. His parents spoke to the police, but his mom was in hysterics and attacked a police officer. They haven‚Äôt been able to find anything. My other friend‚Äôs parents are out of the country so they can‚Äôt be contacted until they are back in the states. It feels like no one is helping, and I have no other choice than to try and track them down myself. Grim left his laptop at home and I have some hacking experience. I broke into the laptop and found a file linked from his phone to the icloud. It‚Äôs encrypted for some reason, he was a paranoid fucker. I'm leaving his writing‚Äôs below, maybe you guys can read through it and find something to help in my search. I‚Äôm not a very good reader. C.L.

Across the world every culture has stories that seem to overlap. First hand testimonies to the evil of the world that has been slowly drowned with time. Shadow people, Jinn, The Hat Man, and so many other names we have given to the dark and evil omens of the world. They knew something, something we have forgotten. Somewhere in our minds perhaps we have remnants of these testimonies, fear. The primal blood curdling feeling of dread and terror, the nightmares, and dreams we are plagued with‚Ä¶ maybe they all mean something more.

I just finished my first year of college, the wonder and awe of the first year slowly dwindling in my eyes as reality set in. 3 more years. The same mantra that got me through highschool, but now I had to pay for my classes. Finals week came and passed, and all I feel is exhausted. Discouraged and unmotivated I‚Äôm counting down the days to the next move. Until‚Ä¶

Michael Wayne Ryan was a truck driver, he had a wife and children, but throughout his life he never found anything of meaning. Soon He hurt himself and could no longer work so he took to marijuana, and spiritualism. Unfortunately he found himself in the Christian Identity Movement, a belief steeped in antisemitism and racism. They prayed to Yahweh and kept kosher like his chosen people, and that‚Äôs all they could talk about, how they were the chosen ones, and Michael went as far as to say he was possessed by the spirit of the archangel Michael. In his mind his righteous war against the serpent seed had just begun, they began prepping for the worst, burglarizing houses to support themselves and amassing as many weapons as possible.¬†

James Thimm, one of Ryan‚Äôs old friends invited him to stay on his pig farm and this was the base of operations. Ryan‚Äôs¬† madness continued as he claimed to be ‚ÄúKing‚Äù and after taking multiple wives, doubts rose in the cult and two cult members were demoted to slaves, chained and shackled to the porch and made to copulate with an innocent goat and sodomize eachother as divine punishment. One of those members was Rick Stice, the father five year old Luke Stice, who‚Äôs torture and suffering cannot and will not be forgotten. I pray for young Luke‚Äôs soul.

His paranoia overcame him as the father of Luke fled the compound, he escaped which would only go on to fuel Michael‚Äôs wrath. The other ‚Äúslave‚Äù James Thimm was accused of poisoning a turkey eaten at a communal meal he was taken to the pig pen‚Ä¶¬†

Ryan and 4 other members (including Ryan‚Äôs own 16 year old) were told to torture him brutally. Ryan wanted the worst for himself, so he broke his arm and removed his pound of flesh with a razor blade and pliers. Then he had his son and another member break his legs before Ryan stomped in James's chest and ribs before finally granting him the grace of death. Soon after they were caught stealing and arrested, Ryan was given the death sentence and believed himself to be in the grace of god till the very end.¬†

I sat with my head throbbing and my eyelids heavy. I've been staring at screens for over 30 hours now, I couldn't believe it, the true story behind ‚ÄúThe Showers.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you ever been to Broken Bow Nebraska?‚Äù I find my mind drifting, slowly escaping me and traveling north.¬†

Cornfields. Nothing but cornfields for miles and miles. No matter how far or how fast you travel‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt escape the cornfields. Cottages and farms pass underneath as my consciousness is dragged along the highway. The true size and scope of the corn belt can‚Äôt be understated. Sometimes when you‚Äôre driving through America there are patches of hours upon hours of flying through the corn fields. You could drive for 10 hours in one direction and still see nothing but corn. It's hopeless, inescapable, in there we‚Äôre a drop of water in the ocean, in there we are just another part of the food chain. Down a dirt road, my consciousness blew up dust like some kind of gust, across more corn, and then‚Ä¶ Wheat. A lone shack, refurbished and freshly painted stood next to the road, a ominous omen compared to the wastes around. I put my hands in my pockets and began to walk. To my left an apple orchard, wide and long. With every glance it became more and more inviting.¬† The trees were littered with all the colors of apples you could imagine, green to red to gold. It was beautiful and alien, a sore thumb in rural nebraska. Red and pink apple blossoms waved in the breeze with temptation in the air. It smelled sweet. To my right, the simple and mundane aforementioned wheat field. The gold noble stalks rising and falling in waves with the wind, yet another alien sight, but compared to the apple orchard, mundane. A mile down the road I started to feel cold. I could see the sun glinting off the golden fields, but I couldn‚Äôt feel the warmth.¬†

Clouds cluttered the sky behind it, and all vegetation seemed to diminish in the lifeless atmosphere of the silo. A clean modernized shack lay next to it, almost an afterthought. The lights remained on inside, and the rain began falling on me. Stinging my face with the cold, as I began to feel the hopelessness wash over me I feel my consciousness being taken again. Up and up to the top of the silo, it was a faded red with a stainless steel cap, and as the wheel lever turned clockwise. It opened slowly, and creaked loudly. The smell hit me, an acidic rotten- iron pungent smell hits my nose and commands me to vomit,but I don't give in. I can see clearly, but the light that filters in reveals a pool of gore. Pieces of worm like meat laying on the floor amongst a pool of dark thick blood, with a light red film on top. Bones and teeth are scattered amongst the other unidentifiable body parts. I lean in closer.¬†

On the far end of the silo away from the light filtering through the hatch, I could see something moving, a glinting metal contraption slowly grinding. Low rumbling noises can be heard through the silo as well as an electrical humming, the kind that could drive you insane, piercing my ears. As the sound of the creaking hatch settles, and my eyes start to adjust , first impressions are over.¬†

I see movement, an elongated pale arm connected to a massive boney body with pale white flesh¬† dragging something towards the metal contraption. Quiet sobs like that of a childs can be heard, and as the creature lifts up its bounty I realize. It's a child‚Ä¶ I think.¬†

Its face is malformed, and in between his lifeless pale blue beady eyes was the nose of a pig. Its torso was separated from its waist, its guts and intestines dripping and swaying as its being carried. Its lifeless eyes gazed out at the light offered by the hatch, almost mesmerized. I stare silently unable to take my eyes off it, equally horrified, disgusted, and intrigued to what would happen next. The lumbering pale creature lifts the child up with one arm dangling it over the contraption. Below him the machine hummed, now that my eyes were adjusted I could see steel spinning cog like wheels below him, hungry and eager. I stared at the child, unable to scream, unable to yell, just a tortured observer behind my own eyes. I will myself to look away with all my might, my eyes set on the pitiful sight of the malformed child, but instead something else happens.¬†

The gaze of the child shifts from the gore bathed in light on the floor, to match mine. As I stare at him, he stares back a look of wrath and fear takes over his face as he begins to squeal and scream, the sound was unique and terrible‚Ä¶ it still haunts me. A sound only a true abomination could make. The creature holding it looks up its lightless black eyes reflecting my own, as it begins this guttural screech‚Ä¶ neither broke eye contact.¬†

The baying of an injured dog echos. It whines and screams. The soft whine grows louder, mixing with the horrid screaming and squealing from the child. As the horrid cries continue I hear other voices rising up, as if echoed through a vent. The slow build of countless screams of children, the dreadful sound made my ears bleed.¬†

I could feel my body go limp as I plummet forward into the gore below. the screaming grows louder and more desperate, and the smell grows even more fowl‚Ä¶

I wake up retching. The putrid vomit hits my throat and burns, I can‚Äôt help it. I look around frantically, something in my mind tells me I'm being watched. I stumble toward the bathroom and slip, smashing my head against the wall. I lay in my misery for a minute and slowly rise to my feet. Hastings. It began taking up more and more space in my mind as the weeks went on. Ever since the video, ever since the story, ever since I was 8 years old‚Ä¶

¬†I woke up screaming from another night terror. My ears still ringing from the shotgun that had killed my parents. In my dream of course, these nightmares became weekly and I felt as if my mind had turned against me. Every culture across the world has stories of the terrors of the night, the monsters hiding just behind the curtain of light‚Ä¶ the monsters that lurk inside us, the truth of our violent and carnal nature. I never have trusted my dreams, nor have I believed they meant anything, but something about this morning just isn‚Äôt right.¬†

Summer break has just begun. I moved away from my family home in California to be with my girlfriend Maya. Wehad our one year anniversary, and since I‚Äôve moved I‚Äôve been doing really well, not just in school, but I've been making healthier habits and finding myself. Now my desk was littered with food bags and empty drink containers. A sweet lavender scent from the candle I burned last night hung in the air, ever since I started researching this story it's been like this.

I have been telling my best friend, Michael, and Maya about the story and my nightmares non stop for two weeks, and they both have told me we should all go on a road trip there‚Ä¶

My stomach feels like it's about to burst, I can‚Äôt tell if it's my nerves or just the fact I haven't had anything but 2 cups of coffee and a red bull in the past 14 hours. My girlfriend is sleeping peacefully beside me, and the loud snoring from the back is low and deep like a slumbering giant. We started in Southern California, picked up Mike and headed north.¬† I stopped to sleep 6 or 8 hours after starting, but even then I was only able to sleep an hour or two.I could smell the corn, see the mesmerizing golden waves of wheat, feel the humid sickly heat‚Ä¶ taste the blood. Ever since then I haven't gotten a wink, I think if I see it for myself, see that it‚Äôs not real then my thoughts will be my own again. I have to find it no matter what and find it false.¬†

‚ÄúBabyyyy, can we go to the bathroom?‚Äù Maya crawls out from her slumber next to me, her face just as adorable as it's ever been.¬†

‚ÄúOf course love, there's an exit in half a mile, be quick.‚Äù I replied slightly thankful for the opportunity to get another energy drink. I don't know where we are, maybe somewhere in utah. We got off in between the major cities on some backroad. There was an old gas station and a shack amongst the green¬† farm land advertising, ‚ÄúRaspberry Smoothies.‚Äù If you‚Äôve been around farmland you know sometimes the producers set up a shack and sell goods directly from the producers. I parked at the gas station and as Maya rushed out of the car door, I waltzed down to the store front, they seemed like nice people, overly nice. Maybe being from the coast has made the charm of the Midwest, but they asked me about my day, where I was going, and the specifics seem foggy for some reason. The red brackish sludge in the paper cup smelt fantastic. It was smooth and creamy, and had just the right amount of sweetness. As I looked down into the cup, the red gloop sloshed‚Ä¶ I suddenly felt like I needed to vomit.

I ran into the side of the gas station sprinting for the bathroom entrance, barely holding onto my stomach. I shoved past a man on his way out and threw up into the trashcan in the next chamber. I could smell the stench‚Ä¶ truck stop bathroom never has been pleasant. I could feel myself getting a headache, the nauseating stench making me wretch more violently. All I could think of was the viscera covered floor of the shiloh, the creature, the child's eyes not full of despair but satisfaction.¬†

I shook myself free of the vision, my head throbbing with pain as the room spun. I went to look in the mirror and wipe off the puke. I looked in the mirror,¬† my mouth was stained with blood dripping down my neck. Warm and putrid, I glanced up. The nose of a pig. I blinked it away, grabbed the paper towels and wiped myself down, sobbing lightly in the empty shitty bathroom

I didn't even want to keep going, I told my girlfriend when I got back to the car, Mike was passed out and with me vomiting and having a headache I just felt like turning around and heading home. My girlfriend had other plans, to see this through, for us, for me. She took over driving for the next length of the journey and I passed out in the passenger seat soon after. .¬†

‚ÄúWake up baby.‚Äù her sweet voice called to me from the blackness of my unconscious, like the graces of god washed upon me, her warmth and the sweet smell of vanilla and cinnamon hit me when she embraced. I don't deserve her.¬†

‚ÄúI'm up darling, did we make it to the hilton?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes baby, let's get going before it starts raining.‚Äù I opened my eyes as she let go of our embrace, the horizon line was empty and flat in all directions, the underlying beauty of the sunset peeking out from a cascade of clouds filled my eyes. A storm was coming. There is such beauty in the dangers of life, the ocean, space, caves, it seems the less we know and the more infinite something is, the more beautiful it becomes. This sunset was no exception, the light was fading fast, hiding behind the earth, and I could feel the biting cold of the drizzling rain above. Utah.¬†

Slept came to Maya quickly, while me and Mike were wide awake. I saw him unpacking his clothes, and taking out his ‚Äúgardening bag.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou goin for a drink?‚Äù I shot him a knowing glace with a grin.

‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶ You comin?‚Äù he held up his bounty, a small hand rolled cigarette, pure white.¬†

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I stepped into the hall and held the door. He followed me out and we made our way to the lobby to look around. We stepped through the lobby, it was dead quiet with no one around. We stepped out and under an overhang for cars to unload luggage and lit up. Mike took a long drag and blew a cloud of white smoke before looking my way with a raised eyebrow.¬†

‚ÄúSo first day in, how are you holding up mr. dreamer?‚Äù He looked at me amused with himself.

‚Äú Well I'm alive aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù I chuckled and held out my hand for him to pass it, he reached over.

‚ÄúNo thanks to that raspberry smoothie, what was their rabbit piss in it?‚Äù he jeered at me. He was met with a swift retort of smoke in his face.

‚ÄúYeah except you would have begged me for a taste if that was the case you freak.‚Äù I chuckled to myself coughing, ‚ÄúIt woulda reminded you of that one ex‚Ä¶‚Äù I teased him before passing.¬†

‚ÄúYou're one to talk, you kiss the ground Maya walks on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell at least she doesnt make me drink the special juice.‚Äù I gave him a side eye, before slapping his shoulder. ‚ÄúCheer up, it's not that bad, she could always have pegged you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh! gross dude, it wasn‚Äôt like that anyways‚Ä¶ Tinder has been pretty dry though.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry bro you‚Äôll find a match, the closer to Arkansas the higher your chances.‚Äù I laughed and he did too. As the embers fell to the wet pavement, the sounds of the rainstorm enveloping everything around us and rest came to us in the late hours of the night.

I can hear the AC running. An obnoxious low hum fills the room as the radiator leaks cold air with a hiss. I can‚Äôt feel Maya next to me. She must be in the bathroom or something. I slowly open my eyes groggy and exhausted. The blank plain ceiling was only disrupted by the shadow of the spinning fan. It is ominous, spinning and spinning, uncaring and unfeeling. I could feel a skittering up my thigh. Slowly making its way under the covers and up my arm. I can‚Äôt move. I could feel my heart beating faster and faster, I tried to get up but my body wont let me. I want to scream, I want to fail this thing off of me and kill it but my body wont let me. My neck muscles won't listen, my mouth isn‚Äôt there. The bug continued un caring, crawling up my arm and shoulder, making its way toward my neck and crawling on the sensitive skin. I want to throw up, it crawls toward my ear and I feel three more skitters across my body, my left leg, right foot, and my right hand. The one near my face continued up toward my ear, not stopping. I could feel them all, the horrible legs, their vile forms defiling me in my conscious prison. I'm gonna be sick, more and more began crawling up me, 4, 12, no 30, more. They begin encasing me, cockroaches run across me head to toe, biting at my flesh millions of sharp pinches in broken harmony. The one burrows deeper into my ear, deeper and deeper. It was the single most painful thing I had ever had to endure. I could feel the wall of my ear being chewed away, the legions swarming my body and consuming. It made its way to where it was warmest, most wet. My brain.¬†

I woke up gasping for air. ‚ÄúBabyyyy‚Äù Maya called up to me as sweet as a kitten, cold sweat dripped down my back and face.¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, I'm right here love it‚Äôs ok.‚Äù I sighed exhaustedly, my heart racing and my head aching worse than ever before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go to the bathroom, I'll be right back.‚Äù I got up and lumbered through the foreign darkness to the bathroom door. I stepped in, closed the door and turned on the light. ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck.‚Äù my eyes had dark circles more pronounced than yesterday and I looked paler than usual. Those drugs can‚Äôt have been good for me. I splashed my face with cold water and let it drip down my chest as I sat on the toilet just trying to collect my thoughts and calm down.

Another 8 hour drive today. I was still groggy from the jarring morning I had, but still I pressed on. The road disappeared beneath me, time losing meaning as it does in the usual roadtrip fashion. We were going from Salt Lake to Denver, the early morning air was thick with fog, we planned on getting there a little early so we could enjoy the city a little. Then it was just one more day till we arrived at our destination. The nervousness was thick in my stomach, I was equally horrified and ecstatic to finally get this over with. The conspiracies and theories have all but consumed me for the past few months. I just couldn‚Äôt understand why nobody is talking about it. I had gone over the history of broken bow over and over, re-read the stories over and over until the words lost all meaning. It was engrained in me now, every letter of every report, every little detail swept under the rug. No one cared. At least that‚Äôs what it seemed like, if the depravity and demonic nature of the place was really true‚Ä¶ It has to burn.

Road signs flew past us, it‚Äôs a straight shot to Denver, same highway for 8 hours can get boring so my mind drifted. *Thunk*¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that?!‚Äù My girlfriend raised from her previously peaceful sleep like she was awake the whole time.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, hold on.‚Äù I pulled to the side of the road slowing down quickly as she jumped out to see what it was. Her shoes hit the ground and I head a high pitch gasp.¬†

‚ÄúBabbyy it was a bunny‚Äù I could hear the tears in her voice, she was always so empathetic, that's one thing I love about her, she loves all life. So much so she wants to be a environmental science major. I walked the perimeter of the car, seeing the blood on my wheel and the mess in the road.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry love, it came out of nowhere, we should keep going though to make good time.‚Äù She gasped again in defiance.

‚ÄúNo! We have to bury it!‚Äù I knew there was no sense in fighting her about it, so I walked to the trunk. I had a old metal baseball bat I liked to keep around just in case. I walked over, and scraped it off the side of the road best I could. The smell wasn‚Äôt great, and flies were already starting to gather.¬†

‚ÄúWe should be quick, its hot out today.‚Äù We began covering the remains with dirt till there was a small mound before patting it flatter. She stuck a nearby pretty rock she was looking for while I was scraping and closed her eyes for a moment, losing herself in her mind, maybe praying, maybe wishing the animal well, before opening them and hugging me.¬†

I looked at the flies and remembered what the bugs that haunted me last night felt like across my skin. It was enough to make me sick, I felt like I had to vomit, something about this trip had just been so morbid, with my dreams and now this. I was worried for the future, but at the end of the day I have my best friend and the love of my life, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine. Maybe it was the sluggishness of the hangover, or maybe the guilt from hitting the rabbit, but as I puked and felt at my lowest, I could feel another presence, something malevolent, something basking in my suffering. Out of the corner of my eye I could swear I saw a man, inches away from my face, smiling at me, unmoving, but breathing hard. Such a gleeful smile, like a little kid, watching closely as I emptied my stomach both sick and terrified. I blinked and it was gone. I think I‚Äôm getting paranoid.¬†

The rest of the trip was pretty mundane, Mike lit a cigarette and opened the window. The sweet tobacco wafted through the air and I thought to myself as the drive continued. It was so beautiful out here, the mountains, the grass, even the sun felt different here. Warmer, more welcoming. When you sleep on a couch in Las Vegas for 6 months pretty much anything is better than that. It was colder in the mountains than it had ever been back home and in Nevada. My parents live in southern California, life was nice there, and my highschool experience was nothing special. I was raised Jewish, my father and his parents were, so naturally every sunday I would be at the temple. All the way up to my bar mitzvah. It was fun, but nothing special. I was too young to gleem the wisdom in tradition and history. I came to appreciate it later though, reading into other religions and history later in my life. I never quite got along with my mom, my brothers and father were fine, but she was always the one who I clashed heads with, for various reasons. Mike was the only reason I was able to get by as a kid, I hated home, and his place was my second one. After that, Maya brought me meaning. I hated people and most of the things in life, until I learned how to love the beauty and futility in our struggle as people. Always trying to be better, and do better. Maya always tries her hardest whenever she choses something, she puts her heart and soul in it, and when she fails it hurts and is hard, but if she loves it she always perseveres. She's always learning new things and skills, spending time outside, listening to music, she has so much love for life, and for the world. I admire that, I never had the same passion for life, I don‚Äôt like people, I have anxiety, but I love to create, and take care of the things around me, that must be what she sees in me. I‚Äôm so thankful for her, I‚Äôd do anything for her. I'm grateful for Mike too, he‚Äôs always there when I‚Äôm in need, at least when his mother lets him. I‚Äôm glad they're with me.¬†

Sunset slowly crept up a grand show of prismatic colors on the horizon. We made a couple bathroom and food stops, but finally, here we are. While we were coming into town there was a sleepy ghost town vibe, it‚Äôs a very small town. The kind where they knew if you weren‚Äôt from around there. There were alot of eyes, people kept staring at us. The town was likely a popular truck stop, gas stations and food establishments crowded the main street but the people weren‚Äôt as warm as I expected. Some kept their heads down while others stared. Maybe it was the California plates, maybe the sunburst orange car, either way I didn‚Äôt like it. Maya found a cute restaurant to get some food in before we went to the hotel, and we found parking on a side street. It was called The Bonfire, and it had a wooden sign with a little bonfire design on it. It had a small town charm that little holes in the walls often had. It was a local‚Äôs place, a nice old lady sat us and handed out the menus. There were 7 items and all of them came with fries. Maya got a burger, Mike got the strip steak, I got a garden salad. Food came quickly, and the waters with them, the waitress put them down, and said ‚ÄúIf y‚Äôall need anything else I‚Äôll be right over there okay?‚Äù She pointed to an empty booth across the floor, we said yes and thanked her. We finished quickly and I put down 40 dollars, thanked the waitress and headed out the door. We are staying in the cobblestone hotel, it's very nice and comfortable. The fireplace in the lobby lit and warm like a beacon in the cold damp summer air. We could feel the humidity shifting, but haven‚Äôt felt it as much as we are now, the air was thick and sticky. Sweat was beading off of us. The decor gave a homey feeling, wooden chairs, leather couches, all ranch-style furniture.¬†

The lady behind the front desk was in her late twenties she spoke as I approached her. ‚ÄúHello sir, what is the name for the check in?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLuke‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAh here you are, let me check you in‚Ä¶ Your room number is 23 enjoy your stay.‚Äù¬† she smiled and I took the key from her hand as she held it out.¬†

‚ÄúThank you, come on baby.‚Äù she was half passed out holding my arm, food always makes her tired. The room was really nice, my friend got his own room here and I laid Maya to bed and went to the bathroom. I took my laptop from my backpack and started reading the local news.¬†

You're going to die here‚Ä¶

My vision went blurry and my headache, I blinked and recoiled from the pain that shot through my head. I blinked and rubbed my eyes.¬†

Runaway Cattle Topple Cars‚Ä¶

Yeah, definitely a pass. I closed the tab and opened youtube.

‚ÄúWe've been waiting for you piggy‚Äù

I heard a cold whisper low and gravely like a beast speaking our language, it‚Äôs breath was cold on my neck and I could swear I felt its nose touching me. I screamed. I jumped and bumped my head on the towel rack above the toilet, my laptop clattering to the ground as the lights went out. My panicked breaths could be heard over the fan.¬†

‚ÄúBaby?!‚Äù

I could here my girlfriend calling, but something was off. The light from the lap top shown up and onto the mirror from the floor.

‚ÄúBaby‚Äù¬†

The high pitches of her voice broke, I could hear an unnatural ressonation. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from, it‚Äôs as if it were in my head.¬†

‚ÄúBABBBYYY‚Äù¬†

Her voice broke as the entity‚Äôs growls broke through under its mockery of her. It got closer and louder, I looked a the shower curtain lit up from the light on the mirror, and a bloody‚Äôs pigs head sat above the curtains, mouth agape.¬†

I woke up on the toilet, laptop on my lap and my neck aching.¬†

‚ÄúBabbby I have to pee.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOne sec lovey.‚Äù I stood up and got myself sorted, put my night ware on, flushed and left.¬†

‚ÄúYou were in there foreverrrr‚Äù she looked irritated and grumpy, she always is after she wakes up.¬†

I rubbed the back of my head, it ached.¬† ‚ÄúSorry baby I fell asleep.‚Äù¬† my neck hurt and I kissed her on the forehead on my way out. I went and laid down on the bed and was out soon after. The bottomless abyss welcoming me once again to the infinite darkness. Sleep. I could feel the dull cool of the inky black around me. I turned around and a deer was chewing something on the ground 50 feet away from me.¬†

‚ÄúHello‚Äù¬†

I stared into my eyes expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúHelllooooo‚Äù¬†

It paced back and forth and I focused in my mind on my response. ‚ÄòHello, how are you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh I am wonderful, it has been so long since I‚Äôve had any visitors how are you child?‚Äù It slowly started to stand up and morph into a more human form, still the head of a deer, but the arms, legs, and body becoming more human.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, been a couple days on the road so my rest is welcome‚Äù I floated around, I tried to make the inky blackness a warm field, and it conformed. The figure sat in a leather seat across from me.¬†

‚ÄúThis is a nice place my child, tell me, what is it you want by coming here?‚Äù He drank from a gold goblet, his pupils black, the stags jaws taking in greedy gulps.¬†

‚ÄúI need to see it, the desecrated grounds, I need to know that it‚Äôs not real, I need this plague of dreams to stop.‚Äù My true feelings came flowing out of my mouth without me thinking. I wanted out, but something was holding me in place, aloft in the air.

‚ÄúGood. Good. My child, you will see soon, have patients, the invitation must be accepted.‚Äù He put the goblet down and stared at me with his empty animal eyes. ‚ÄúCan we come in?‚Äù His stag face grew into a cartoonish smile‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt natural, it scared me to my core, I wanted out. I looked at the sun grazing the field below me with golden light, it was so bright, brighter than any other. As I stared into the light my surroundings dulled, My dream blurred and a ladder was extended from the light, I put my hand on it.¬†

Maya's face stared back at me, her eyes unopened, my body was uncomfortably sweaty. I sat up trying to control my breathing. I‚Äôm so tired of these vivid dreams. My doctor said the pills will help, but they just make me feel fuzzy and blurry, it doesn't stop the visions, the painfully sleepless nights, for some reason my mind just won't quit. I got up and made my way to the bathroom.¬†

The shower water was hot against my skin, the night was cold, but I woke up feeling like a sauna. I turned down the heat and grabbed the soap. I shampooed, and cleaned, reflecting on last night's thoughts. I hate how tired I look, my eye bags and the dark circles have just gotten bigger. I closed my eyes as I rinsed my hair out. The water grew thick and almost oily against my hands. I looked up, and there it was. A pigs head showering lukewarm blood and viscera on me. I blinked again. I‚Äôm over it. I turned the water off and got out, I dried off, brushed my teeth, and took care of my morning routine. I came out of the bathroom and I heard mayas sleepy voice, ‚ÄùBaby.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, it‚Äôs time to get up, the free breakfast ends at 9.‚Äù

She squealed with excitement, and started to get ready. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you downstairs baby I‚Äôm gonna get Mike‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOkayy.‚Äù

I headed out the door and across the hall, knocked three times and waited for a response. As the door squeaked open I greeted him .

‚ÄúHello there.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning good sir, would‚Äôth thow like to go for a dubious smoke? He was in a good mood and entertained, the best mood a michael could be in.¬†

‚ÄúOf course lad, lead the way.‚Äù He walked out of his room animated and to the side door, we marched out to the car and lit up.¬†

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to sleep for shit bro, i'm so tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúBet you‚Äôre glad we‚Äôre not doing a huge drive today though.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair, fair, I hope it is all gonna be over soon‚Äù I took a long drag and passed it to him.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù He grabbed it from me.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having vivid dreams again and debunking this should help. I think.‚Äù I looked at my lap as he finished it, I opened the door and started back inside since Maya would be there soon.¬†

We met in the lobby. I saw her eating waffles with a plate piled high, she made me smile, just by being her. Mike came and got his food, sausage and eggs, I got coffee and began planing the day‚Äôs journey. I sat down with my laptop and began research, checking every resource I have to try and find the address of the pig farm. I didn‚Äôt find much but a road name. ‚ÄúObsidian Drive.‚Äù I found it on google maps and closed the laptop, Mike was finished with his food, and maya was halfway to a food coma, leaving a 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 of the original waffles size.¬†

‚ÄúAlright lets go‚Äù I got up and threw away my empty coffee cup. Mike and Maya followed after me, and I made my way to the car. I got in the car and set up my maps, it‚Äôs just a matter of time now. My brain ached from last night, but I didn‚Äôt care, I need to be free of this burden. After Maya and Mike got it I started driving, it was miles on miles of corn field.After we got out of town there would be 10 minutes of driving straight down corn feild before the next road sign. It continued like this for hours, we drove down alabaster drive, the corn unending. We had been driving on this road for about 4 hours now, but no sign of the place I‚Äôm looking for.¬†

‚ÄúBaby, I think we‚Äôve seen this already, are we driving in a circle?‚Äù Maya groaned exhausted and a little annoyed. I looked out the window, corn. There was a little red shack though, that did look somewhat familiar.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so love, everything just looks the same out here.‚Äù I chimed back as I continued steering, I could never tell if something was going to pop out of the corn, it was so suffocating, hugging the road tight.¬†

Mike chimed in from the back, ‚ÄúAll this corn and still world hunger, that's crazy.‚Äù¬†

I laughed and shook my head,‚ÄùWe can‚Äôt even feed corn to hungry people, we don't digest it fully.‚Äù¬†

Maya looked over with a thinking face, ‚ÄúWell that's ironic.‚Äù

I smiled to myself, as I responded ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs American, we pick the most unhealthy fruit we possibly can and make it an industry. Vitamins, nutrients, minerals, and we choose to consume corn syrup, truly its gross.‚Äù I thought about all the different candies, sodas, and other confections we make with corn syrup.¬†

Mike took a hit of his vape, ‚ÄúOnly here could we grow diabetes.‚Äù¬†

I laughed and my attention shifted, my eyes hadn‚Äôt been on the road, my attention was on my thoughts, I could feel the world slow down around me. A moose stood in the middle of the road, inevitable, and built like a house. This is how it ends, I slammed on my brakes and swerved to the right, nearly sending us into the corn field but stopping just short as my panicked breathing started up. Maya and Mike shrieked as we stopped just short.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck babe!‚Äù Maya socked me in the shoulder with a dull thud.¬†

‚ÄúOw! Dammit, there was something in the road.‚Äù I looked back expecting to see the moose, but all I saw was the calm breeze blowing the corn too and fro.¬†

‚ÄúI didn't see anything! Be more careful next time!‚Äù She looked at me with confusion mixed with anger.¬†

‚ÄúSorry baby, we‚Äôre almost there, promise.‚Äù I started driving again, getting back on the road. The sun was hot, beating down on us a little after mid-day. The more I drove the more the road seemed to narrow somewhat. Maya fell asleep, and there were no other cars on the road, so I wasn‚Äôt worried. A few barns in a couple hours, it seemed like it was getting more and more sparse, in these backroads that‚Äôs how it is sometimes. It was about 4 pm and the road just kept getting more perilously narrow, the corn hugging the sides of the road almost groping the car as we drive in, almost like it was closing around us. Like the road was swallowing us as alive as we drove deeper.¬†

‚ÄúJesus dude, this road is fucked.‚Äù Mike observed the bleakness of the landscape and the condition of the dirt road. I was swerving potholes trying not to run into the corn. It was almost like the road itself was trying to stop us, maybe trying to tell us to turn back.¬†

My conviction was strong and hands were deft, I swerved through the road the shadows of the corn stalks darkening the road around me. As I thought the corn would fully block the road and consume us, the corn ended, the golden sun blinding me momentarily as it had been hidden for a while. Wheat.¬†

I saw golden wheat fields, to either the left or right, beautiful waving golden wheat. I kept on driving, sighing with exhaustion as I looked for what I knew would be there, an orchard. I drove for a mile, and then near the end of the street I could see a house with a silo. It looked different‚Ä¶ no orchard, just a green silo and a red pristine house. I didn‚Äôt recognize it, but it felt so similar. I had to see inside. I drove off the side of the road near it, turning off my lights and putting it in neutral as I approached, trying to be quiet just incase. Maya was still asleep, and I was not willing to endure the wrath of waking her after such a dubious journey. Me and Mike went ahead, he lit a cigarette as we walked up. We could see a window on the house, blank walls and well lit rooms. There was no sign of life but the inside looked clean.¬†

‚ÄúLooks empty Mike, what's the move?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought this was your plan genius, probably this.‚Äù He opened the door with no caution, cockily smiling as he did so. ‚ÄúEmpty, just like you said.‚Äù

He went in and I followed, it was strange, it was a perfectly kept house, but with no furniture, no art, no signs of life at all. It was all a dull white gray except for a green door with a golden knocker, and a gold door handle. It was all freshly painted and smelled stale and stagnant.¬†

I talked to Mike in a low whisper ‚ÄúStrange, it's empty but seems new.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, there just being one door is creepy, put a couch or something.‚Äù

I looked around more, but just more empty space, I approached the second door.¬†

‚ÄúYou ready for this?‚Äù

I heard a little tremble in his voice ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù¬†

I was excited, but sick at the same time, my stomach roiling and folding in on itself at the implications of this, I grabbed the door knob and began to turn it.

It's walled off, nothing but a brick wall covering a 4ft tall Semi-circle entrance. I couldn't believe it.¬†¬†

Mike protested with disappointment ‚ÄúReally dude?! I thought there would be something at least.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but when he shouted there was a noise, a shuffling, but when covered by his voice it sounded like a figment of my imagination, plus my mind was playing tricks on me anyways. We went back to the car and headed back to the hotel, the street that seemed to consume the car now just your regular dirt road. All this is just too much, if I dont write it down I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose it. To whomever is reading. Thank you. Without you I wouldn't be able to take it, the weight of this thing, this sickening force on my mind. The sleep deprivation is getting to me, it‚Äôs currently 3 AM and Maya is passed out next to me in bed. I wish I could tell them the severity of this curse, but they don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôre going back tomorrow, Maya isn‚Äôt too happy about it, but Mike is up for the challenge, and this thing isn‚Äôt done with me yet.

We‚Äôre part way through summer and he hasn‚Äôt come back in a month and a half. He wont answer his texts, location services are off. Ever since middle school Us three have been inseparable and I can‚Äôt shake this nagging feeling something bad must have happened. His parents spoke to the police, but his mom was in hysterics and attacked a police officer. They haven‚Äôt been able to find anything. My other friend‚Äôs parents are out of the country so they can‚Äôt be contacted until they are back in the states. It feels like no one is helping, and I have no other choice than to try and track them down myself. Grim left his laptop at home and I have some hacking experience. I broke into the laptop and found a file linked from his phone to the icloud. It‚Äôs encrypted for some reason, he was a paranoid fucker.

Across the world every culture has stories that seem to overlap. First hand testimonies to the evil of the world that has been slowly drowned with time. Shadow people, Jinn, The Hat Man, and so many other names we have given to the dark and evil omens of the world. They knew something, something we have forgotten. Somewhere in our minds perhaps we have remnants of these testimonies, fear. The primal blood curdling feeling of dread and terror, the nightmares, and dreams we are plagued with‚Ä¶ maybe they all mean something more.

I just finished my first year of college, the wonder and awe of the first year slowly dwindling in my eyes as reality set in. 3 more years.

Discouraged and unmotivated I‚Äôm counting down the days to the next move. Until‚Ä¶

Michael Wayne Ryan was a truck driver, he had a wife and children, but throughout his life he never found anything of meaning. Soon He hurt himself and could no longer work so he took to marijuana, and spiritualism. Unfortunately he found himself in the Christian Identity Movement, a belief steeped in antisemitism and racism. They prayed to Yahweh and kept kosher like his chosen people, and that‚Äôs all they could talk about, how they were the chosen ones, and Michael went as far as to say he was possessed by the spirit of the archangel Michael. In his mind his righteous war against the serpent seed had just begun, they began prepping for the worst, burglarizing houses to support themselves and amassing as many weapons as possible.¬†

James Thimm, one of Ryan‚Äôs old friends invited him to stay on his pig farm and this was the base of operations. Ryan‚Äôs¬† madness continued as he claimed to be ‚ÄúKing‚Äù and after taking multiple wives, doubts rose in the cult and two cult members were demoted to slaves, chained and shackled to the porch and made to copulate with an innocent goat and sodomize eachother as divine punishment. One of those members was Rick Stice, the father five year old Luke Stice, who‚Äôs torture and suffering cannot and will not be forgotten. I pray for young Luke‚Äôs soul.

His paranoia overcame him as the father of Luke fled the compound, he escaped which would only go on to fuel Michael‚Äôs wrath. The other ‚Äúslave‚Äù James Thimm was accused of poisoning a turkey eaten at a communal meal he was taken to the pig pen‚Ä¶¬†

Ryan and 4 other members (including Ryan‚Äôs own 16 year old) were told to torture him brutally. Ryan wanted the worst for himself, so he broke his arm and removed his pound of flesh with a razor blade and pliers. Then he had his son and another member break his legs before Ryan stomped in James's chest and ribs before finally granting him the grace of death. Soon after they were caught stealing and arrested, Ryan was given the death sentence and believed himself to be in the grace of god till the very end.¬†

I sat with my head throbbing and my eyelids heavy. I've been staring at screens for over 30 hours now, I couldn't believe it, the true story behind ‚ÄúThe Showers.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you ever been to Broken Bow Nebraska?‚Äù I find my mind drifting, slowly escaping me and traveling north.¬†

Cornfields. Nothing but cornfields for miles and miles. No matter how far or how fast you travel‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt escape the cornfields. Cottages and farms pass underneath as my consciousness is dragged along the highway. The true size and scope of the corn belt can‚Äôt be understated. Sometimes when you‚Äôre driving through America there are patches of hours upon hours of flying through the corn fields. You could drive for 10 hours in one direction and still see nothing but corn. It's hopeless, inescapable, in there we‚Äôre a drop of water in the ocean, in there we are just another part of the food chain. Down a dirt road, my consciousness blew up dust like some kind of gust, across more corn, and then‚Ä¶ Wheat. A lone shack, refurbished and freshly painted stood next to the road, a ominous omen compared to the wastes around. I put my hands in my pockets and began to walk. To my left an apple orchard, wide and long. With every glance it became more and more inviting.¬† The trees were littered with all the colors of apples you could imagine, green to red to gold. It was beautiful and alien, a sore thumb in rural nebraska. Red and pink apple blossoms waved in the breeze with temptation in the air. It smelled sweet. To my right, the simple and mundane aforementioned wheat field. The gold noble stalks rising and falling in waves with the wind, yet another alien sight, but compared to the apple orchard, mundane. A mile down the road I started to feel cold. I could see the sun glinting off the golden fields, but I couldn‚Äôt feel the warmth.¬†

Clouds cluttered the sky behind it, and all vegetation seemed to diminish in the lifeless atmosphere of the silo. A clean modernized shack lay next to it, almost an afterthought. The lights remained on inside, and the rain began falling on me. Stinging my face with the cold, as I began to feel the hopelessness wash over me I feel my consciousness being taken again. Up and up to the top of the silo, it was a faded red with a stainless steel cap, and as the wheel lever turned clockwise. It opened slowly, and creaked loudly. The smell hit me, an acidic rotten- iron pungent smell hits my nose and commands me to vomit,but I don't give in. I can see clearly, but the light that filters in reveals a pool of gore. Pieces of worm like meat laying on the floor amongst a pool of dark thick blood, with a light red film on top. Bones and teeth are scattered amongst the other unidentifiable body parts. I lean in closer.¬†

On the far end of the silo away from the light filtering through the hatch, I could see something moving, a glinting metal contraption slowly grinding. Low rumbling noises can be heard through the silo as well as an electrical humming, the kind that could drive you insane, piercing my ears. As the sound of the creaking hatch settles, and my eyes start to adjust , first impressions are over.¬†

I see movement, an elongated pale arm connected to a massive boney body with pale white flesh¬† dragging something towards the metal contraption. Quiet sobs like that of a childs can be heard, and as the creature lifts up its bounty I realize. It's a child‚Ä¶ I think.¬†

Its face is malformed, and in between his lifeless pale blue beady eyes was the nose of a pig. Its torso was separated from its waist, its guts and intestines dripping and swaying as its being carried. Its lifeless eyes gazed out at the light offered by the hatch, almost mesmerized. I stare silently unable to take my eyes off it, equally horrified, disgusted, and intrigued to what would happen next. The lumbering pale creature lifts the child up with one arm dangling it over the contraption. Below him the machine hummed, now that my eyes were adjusted I could see steel spinning cog like wheels below him, hungry and eager. I stared at the child, unable to scream, unable to yell, just a tortured observer behind my own eyes. I will myself to look away with all my might, my eyes set on the pitiful sight of the malformed child, but instead something else happens.¬†

The gaze of the child shifts from the gore bathed in light on the floor, to match mine. As I stare at him, he stares back a look of wrath and fear takes over his face as he begins to squeal and scream, the sound was unique and terrible‚Ä¶ it still haunts me. A sound only a true abomination could make. The creature holding it looks up its lightless black eyes reflecting my own, as it begins this guttural screech‚Ä¶ neither broke eye contact.¬†

The baying of an injured dog echos. It whines and screams. The soft whine grows louder, mixing with the horrid screaming and squealing from the child. As the horrid cries continue I hear other voices rising up, as if echoed through a vent. The slow build of countless screams of children, the dreadful sound made my ears bleed.¬†

I could feel my body go limp as I plummet forward into the gore below. the screaming grows louder and more desperate, and the smell grows even more fowl‚Ä¶

I wake up retching. The putrid vomit hits my throat and burns, I can‚Äôt help it. I look around frantically, something in my mind tells me I'm being watched. I stumble toward the bathroom and slip, smashing my head against the wall. I lay in my misery for a minute and slowly rise to my feet. Hastings. It began taking up more and more space in my mind as the weeks went on. Ever since the video, ever since the story, ever since I was 8 years old‚Ä¶

¬†I woke up screaming from another night terror. My ears still ringing from the shotgun that had killed my parents. In my dream of course, these nightmares became weekly and I felt as if my mind had turned against me. Every culture across the world has stories of the terrors of the night, the monsters hiding just behind the curtain of light‚Ä¶ the monsters that lurk inside us, the truth of our violent and carnal nature. I never have trusted my dreams, nor have I believed they meant anything, but something about this morning just isn‚Äôt right.¬†

Summer break has just begun. I moved away from my family home in California to be with my girlfriend Maya. Wehad our one year anniversary, and since I‚Äôve moved I‚Äôve been doing really well, not just in school, but I've been making healthier habits and finding myself. Now my desk was littered with food bags and empty drink containers. A sweet lavender scent from the candle I burned last night hung in the air, ever since I started researching this story it's been like this.

I have been telling my best friend, Michael, and Maya about the story and my nightmares non stop for two weeks, and they both have told me we should all go on a road trip there‚Ä¶

My stomach feels like it's about to burst, I can‚Äôt tell if it's my nerves or just the fact I haven't had anything but 2 cups of coffee and a red bull in the past 14 hours. My girlfriend is sleeping peacefully beside me, and the loud snoring from the back is low and deep like a slumbering giant. We started in Southern California, picked up Mike and headed north.¬† I stopped to sleep 6 or 8 hours after starting, but even then I was only able to sleep an hour or two.I could smell the corn, see the mesmerizing golden waves of wheat, feel the humid sickly heat‚Ä¶ taste the blood. Ever since then I haven't gotten a wink, I think if I see it for myself, see that it‚Äôs not real then my thoughts will be my own again. I have to find it no matter what and find it false.¬†

‚ÄúBabyyyy, can we go to the bathroom?‚Äù Maya crawls out from her slumber next to me, her face just as adorable as it's ever been.¬†

‚ÄúOf course love, there's an exit in half a mile, be quick.‚Äù I replied slightly thankful for the opportunity to get another energy drink. I don't know where we are, maybe somewhere in utah. We got off in between the major cities on some backroad. There was an old gas station and a shack amongst the green¬† farm land advertising, ‚ÄúRaspberry Smoothies.‚Äù If you‚Äôve been around farmland you know sometimes the producers set up a shack and sell goods directly from the producers. I parked at the gas station and as Maya rushed out of the car door, I waltzed down to the store front, they seemed like nice people, overly nice. Maybe being from the coast has made the charm of the Midwest, but they asked me about my day, where I was going, and the specifics seem foggy for some reason. The red brackish sludge in the paper cup smelt fantastic. It was smooth and creamy, and had just the right amount of sweetness. As I looked down into the cup, the red gloop sloshed‚Ä¶ I suddenly felt like I needed to vomit.

I ran into the side of the gas station sprinting for the bathroom entrance, barely holding onto my stomach. I shoved past a man on his way out and threw up into the trashcan in the next chamber. I could smell the stench‚Ä¶ truck stop bathroom never has been pleasant. I could feel myself getting a headache, the nauseating stench making me wretch more violently. All I could think of was the viscera covered floor of the shiloh, the creature, the child's eyes not full of despair but satisfaction.¬†

I shook myself free of the vision, my head throbbing with pain as the room spun. I went to look in the mirror and wipe off the puke. I looked in the mirror,¬† my mouth was stained with blood dripping down my neck. Warm and putrid, I glanced up. The nose of a pig. I blinked it away, grabbed the paper towels and wiped myself down, sobbing lightly in the empty shitty bathroom

I didn't even want to keep going, I told my girlfriend when I got back to the car, Mike was passed out and with me vomiting and having a headache I just felt like turning around and heading home. My girlfriend had other plans, to see this through, for us, for me. She took over driving for the next length of the journey and I passed out in the passenger seat soon after. .¬†

‚ÄúWake up baby.‚Äù her sweet voice called to me from the blackness of my unconscious, like the graces of god washed upon me, her warmth and the sweet smell of vanilla and cinnamon hit me when she embraced. I don't deserve her.¬†

‚ÄúI'm up darling, did we make it to the hilton?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes baby, let's get going before it starts raining.‚Äù I opened my eyes as she let go of our embrace, the horizon line was empty and flat in all directions, the underlying beauty of the sunset peeking out from a cascade of clouds filled my eyes. A storm was coming. There is such beauty in the dangers of life, the ocean, space, caves, it seems the less we know and the more infinite something is, the more beautiful it becomes. This sunset was no exception, the light was fading fast, hiding behind the earth, and I could feel the biting cold of the drizzling rain above. Utah.¬†

Slept came to Maya quickly, while me and Mike were wide awake. I saw him unpacking his clothes, and taking out his ‚Äúgardening bag.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou goin for a drink?‚Äù I shot him a knowing glace with a grin.

‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶ You comin?‚Äù he held up his bounty, a small hand rolled cigarette, pure white.¬†

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I stepped into the hall and held the door. He followed me out and we made our way to the lobby to look around. We stepped through the lobby, it was dead quiet with no one around. We stepped out and under an overhang for cars to unload luggage and lit up. Mike took a long drag and blew a cloud of white smoke before looking my way with a raised eyebrow.¬†

‚ÄúSo first day in, how are you holding up mr. dreamer?‚Äù He looked at me amused with himself.

‚Äú Well I'm alive aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù I chuckled and held out my hand for him to pass it, he reached over.

‚ÄúNo thanks to that raspberry smoothie, what was their rabbit piss in it?‚Äù he jeered at me. He was met with a swift retort of smoke in his face.

‚ÄúYeah except you would have begged me for a taste if that was the case you freak.‚Äù I chuckled to myself coughing, ‚ÄúIt woulda reminded you of that one ex‚Ä¶‚Äù I teased him before passing.¬†

‚ÄúYou're one to talk, you kiss the ground Maya walks on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell at least she doesnt make me drink the special juice.‚Äù I gave him a side eye, before slapping his shoulder. ‚ÄúCheer up, it's not that bad, she could always have pegged you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh! gross dude, it wasn‚Äôt like that anyways‚Ä¶ Tinder has been pretty dry though.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry bro you‚Äôll find a match, the closer to Arkansas the higher your chances.‚Äù I laughed and he did too. As the embers fell to the wet pavement, the sounds of the rainstorm enveloping everything around us and rest came to us in the late hours of the night.

I can hear the AC running. An obnoxious low hum fills the room as the radiator leaks cold air with a hiss. I can‚Äôt feel Maya next to me. She must be in the bathroom or something. I slowly open my eyes groggy and exhausted. The blank plain ceiling was only disrupted by the shadow of the spinning fan. It is ominous, spinning and spinning, uncaring and unfeeling. I could feel a skittering up my thigh. Slowly making its way under the covers and up my arm. I can‚Äôt move. I could feel my heart beating faster and faster, I tried to get up but my body wont let me. I want to scream, I want to fail this thing off of me and kill it but my body wont let me. My neck muscles won't listen, my mouth isn‚Äôt there. The bug continued un caring, crawling up my arm and shoulder, making its way toward my neck and crawling on the sensitive skin. I want to throw up, it crawls toward my ear and I feel three more skitters across my body, my left leg, right foot, and my right hand. The one near my face continued up toward my ear, not stopping. I could feel them all, the horrible legs, their vile forms defiling me in my conscious prison. I'm gonna be sick, more and more began crawling up me, 4, 12, no 30, more. They begin encasing me, cockroaches run across me head to toe, biting at my flesh millions of sharp pinches in broken harmony. The one burrows deeper into my ear, deeper and deeper. It was the single most painful thing I had ever had to endure. I could feel the wall of my ear being chewed away, the legions swarming my body and consuming. It made its way to where it was warmest, most wet. My brain.¬†  
  
I woke up gasping for air. ‚ÄúBabyyyy‚Äù Maya called up to me as sweet as a kitten, cold sweat dripped down my back and face.¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, I'm right here love it‚Äôs ok.‚Äù I sighed exhaustedly, my heart racing and my head aching worse than ever before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go to the bathroom, I'll be right back.‚Äù I got up and lumbered through the foreign darkness to the bathroom door. I stepped in, closed the door and turned on the light. ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck.‚Äù my eyes had dark circles more pronounced than yesterday and I looked paler than usual. Those drugs can‚Äôt have been good for me. I splashed my face with cold water and let it drip down my chest as I sat on the toilet just trying to collect my thoughts and calm down.

Another 8 hour drive today. I was still groggy from the jarring morning I had, but still I pressed on. The road disappeared beneath me, time losing meaning as it does in the usual roadtrip fashion. We were going from Salt Lake to Denver, the early morning air was thick with fog, we planned on getting there a little early so we could enjoy the city a little. Then it was just one more day till we arrived at our destination. The nervousness was thick in my stomach, I was equally horrified and ecstatic to finally get this over with. The conspiracies and theories have all but consumed me for the past few months. I just couldn‚Äôt understand why nobody is talking about it. I had gone over the history of broken bow over and over, re-read the stories over and over until the words lost all meaning. It was engrained in me now, every letter of every report, every little detail swept under the rug. No one cared. At least that‚Äôs what it seemed like, if the depravity and demonic nature of the place was really true‚Ä¶ It has to burn.

Road signs flew past us, it‚Äôs a straight shot to Denver, same highway for 8 hours can get boring so my mind drifted. *Thunk*¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that?!‚Äù My girlfriend raised from her previously peaceful sleep like she was awake the whole time.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, hold on.‚Äù I pulled to the side of the road slowing down quickly as she jumped out to see what it was. Her shoes hit the ground and I head a high pitch gasp.¬†  
  
‚ÄúBabbyy it was a bunny‚Äù I could hear the tears in her voice, she was always so empathetic, that's one thing I love about her, she loves all life. So much so she wants to be a environmental science major. I walked the perimeter of the car, seeing the blood on my wheel and the mess in the road.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry love, it came out of nowhere, we should keep going though to make good time.‚Äù She gasped again in defiance.  
  
‚ÄúNo! We have to bury it!‚Äù I knew there was no sense in fighting her about it, so I walked to the trunk. I had a old metal baseball bat I liked to keep around just in case. I walked over, and scraped it off the side of the road best I could. The smell wasn‚Äôt great, and flies were already starting to gather.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWe should be quick, its hot out today.‚Äù We began covering the remains with dirt till there was a small mound before patting it flatter. She stuck a nearby pretty rock she was looking for while I was scraping and closed her eyes for a moment, losing herself in her mind, maybe praying, maybe wishing the animal well, before opening them and hugging me.¬†  
  
  
  
I looked at the flies and remembered what the bugs that haunted me last night felt like across my skin. It was enough to make me sick, I felt like I had to vomit, something about this trip had just been so morbid, with my dreams and now this. I was worried for the future, but at the end of the day I have my best friend and the love of my life, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine. Maybe it was the sluggishness of the hangover, or maybe the guilt from hitting the rabbit, but as I puked and felt at my lowest, I could feel another presence, something malevolent, something basking in my suffering. Out of the corner of my eye I could swear I saw a man, inches away from my face, smiling at me, unmoving, but breathing hard. Such a gleeful smile, like a little kid, watching closely as I emptied my stomach both sick and terrified. I blinked and it was gone. I think I‚Äôm getting paranoid.¬†

The rest of the trip was pretty mundane, Mike lit a cigarette and opened the window. The sweet tobacco wafted through the air and I thought to myself as the drive continued. It was so beautiful out here, the mountains, the grass, even the sun felt different here. Warmer, more welcoming. When you sleep on a couch in Las Vegas for 6 months pretty much anything is better than that. It was colder in the mountains than it had ever been back home and in Nevada. My parents live in southern California, life was nice there, and my highschool experience was nothing special. I was raised Jewish, my father and his parents were, so naturally every sunday I would be at the temple. All the way up to my bar mitzvah. It was fun, but nothing special. I was too young to gleem the wisdom in tradition and history. I came to appreciate it later though, reading into other religions and history later in my life. I never quite got along with my mom, my brothers and father were fine, but she was always the one who I clashed heads with, for various reasons. Mike was the only reason I was able to get by as a kid, I hated home, and his place was my second one. After that, Maya brought me meaning. I hated people and most of the things in life, until I learned how to love the beauty and futility in our struggle as people. Always trying to be better, and do better. Maya always tries her hardest whenever she choses something, she puts her heart and soul in it, and when she fails it hurts and is hard, but if she loves it she always perseveres. She's always learning new things and skills, spending time outside, listening to music, she has so much love for life, and for the world. I admire that, I never had the same passion for life, I don‚Äôt like people, I have anxiety, but I love to create, and take care of the things around me, that must be what she sees in me. I‚Äôm so thankful for her, I‚Äôd do anything for her. I'm grateful for Mike too, he‚Äôs always there when I‚Äôm in need, at least when his mother lets him. I‚Äôm glad they're with me.¬†

Sunset slowly crept up a grand show of prismatic colors on the horizon. We made a couple bathroom and food stops, but finally, here we are. While we were coming into town there was a sleepy ghost town vibe, it‚Äôs a very small town. The kind where they knew if you weren‚Äôt from around there. There were alot of eyes, people kept staring at us. The town was likely a popular truck stop, gas stations and food establishments crowded the main street but the people weren‚Äôt as warm as I expected. Some kept their heads down while others stared. Maybe it was the California plates, maybe the sunburst orange car, either way I didn‚Äôt like it. Maya found a cute restaurant to get some food in before we went to the hotel, and we found parking on a side street. It was called The Bonfire, and it had a wooden sign with a little bonfire design on it. It had a small town charm that little holes in the walls often had. It was a local‚Äôs place, a nice old lady sat us and handed out the menus. There were 7 items and all of them came with fries. Maya got a burger, Mike got the strip steak, I got a garden salad. Food came quickly, and the waters with them, the waitress put them down, and said ‚ÄúIf y‚Äôall need anything else I‚Äôll be right over there okay?‚Äù She pointed to an empty booth across the floor, we said yes and thanked her. We finished quickly and I put down 40 dollars, thanked the waitress and headed out the door. We are staying in the cobblestone hotel, it's very nice and comfortable. The fireplace in the lobby lit and warm like a beacon in the cold damp summer air. We could feel the humidity shifting, but haven‚Äôt felt it as much as we are now, the air was thick and sticky. Sweat was beading off of us. The decor gave a homey feeling, wooden chairs, leather couches, all ranch-style furniture.¬†

The lady behind the front desk was in her late twenties she spoke as I approached her. ‚ÄúHello sir, what is the name for the check in?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLuke‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAh here you are, let me check you in‚Ä¶ Your room number is 23 enjoy your stay.‚Äù¬† she smiled and I took the key from her hand as she held it out.¬†

‚ÄúThank you, come on baby.‚Äù she was half passed out holding my arm, food always makes her tired. The room was really nice, my friend got his own room here and I laid Maya to bed and went to the bathroom. I took my laptop from my backpack and started reading the local news.¬†

You're going to die here‚Ä¶

My vision went blurry and my headache, I blinked and recoiled from the pain that shot through my head. I blinked and rubbed my eyes.¬†

Runaway Cattle Topple Cars‚Ä¶

Yeah, definitely a pass. I closed the tab and opened youtube.

‚ÄúWe've been waiting for you piggy‚Äù

I heard a cold whisper low and gravely like a beast speaking our language, it‚Äôs breath was cold on my neck and I could swear I felt its nose touching me. I screamed. I jumped and bumped my head on the towel rack above the toilet, my laptop clattering to the ground as the lights went out. My panicked breaths could be heard over the fan.¬†

‚ÄúBaby?!‚Äù

I could here my girlfriend calling, but something was off. The light from the lap top shown up and onto the mirror from the floor.

‚ÄúBaby‚Äù¬†

The high pitches of her voice broke, I could hear an unnatural ressonation. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from, it‚Äôs as if it were in my head.¬†

‚ÄúBABBBYYY‚Äù¬†

Her voice broke as the entity‚Äôs growls broke through under its mockery of her. It got closer and louder, I looked a the shower curtain lit up from the light on the mirror, and a bloody‚Äôs pigs head sat above the curtains, mouth agape.¬†

I woke up on the toilet, laptop on my lap and my neck aching.¬†

‚ÄúBabbby I have to pee.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOne sec lovey.‚Äù I stood up and got myself sorted, put my night ware on, flushed and left.¬†

‚ÄúYou were in there foreverrrr‚Äù she looked irritated and grumpy, she always is after she wakes up.¬†

I rubbed the back of my head, it ached.¬† ‚ÄúSorry baby I fell asleep.‚Äù¬† my neck hurt and I kissed her on the forehead on my way out. I went and laid down on the bed and was out soon after. The bottomless abyss welcoming me once again to the infinite darkness. Sleep. I could feel the dull cool of the inky black around me. I turned around and a deer was chewing something on the ground 50 feet away from me.¬†

‚ÄúHello‚Äù¬†

I stared into my eyes expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúHelllooooo‚Äù¬†

It paced back and forth and I focused in my mind on my response. ‚ÄòHello, how are you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh I am wonderful, it has been so long since I‚Äôve had any visitors how are you child?‚Äù It slowly started to stand up and morph into a more human form, still the head of a deer, but the arms, legs, and body becoming more human.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, been a couple days on the road so my rest is welcome‚Äù I floated around, I tried to make the inky blackness a warm field, and it conformed. The figure sat in a leather seat across from me.¬†

‚ÄúThis is a nice place my child, tell me, what is it you want by coming here?‚Äù He drank from a gold goblet, his pupils black, the stags jaws taking in greedy gulps.¬†

‚ÄúI need to see it, the desecrated grounds, I need to know that it‚Äôs not real, I need this plague of dreams to stop.‚Äù My true feelings came flowing out of my mouth without me thinking. I wanted out, but something was holding me in place, aloft in the air.

‚ÄúGood. Good. My child, you will see soon, have patients, the invitation must be accepted.‚Äù He put the goblet down and stared at me with his empty animal eyes. ‚ÄúCan we come in?‚Äù His stag face grew into a cartoonish smile‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt natural, it scared me to my core, I wanted out. I looked at the sun grazing the field below me with golden light, it was so bright, brighter than any other. As I stared into the light my surroundings dulled, My dream blurred and a ladder was extended from the light, I put my hand on it.¬†

Maya's face stared back at me, her eyes unopened, my body was uncomfortably sweaty. I sat up trying to control my breathing. I‚Äôm so tired of these vivid dreams. My doctor said the pills will help, but they just make me feel fuzzy and blurry, it doesn't stop the visions, the painfully sleepless nights, for some reason my mind just won't quit. I got up and made my way to the bathroom.¬†

The shower water was hot against my skin, the night was cold, but I woke up feeling like a sauna. I turned down the heat and grabbed the soap. I shampooed, and cleaned, reflecting on last night's thoughts. I hate how tired I look, my eye bags and the dark circles have just gotten bigger. I closed my eyes as I rinsed my hair out. The water grew thick and almost oily against my hands. I looked up, and there it was. A pigs head showering lukewarm blood and viscera on me. I blinked again. I‚Äôm over it. I turned the water off and got out, I dried off, brushed my teeth, and took care of my morning routine. I came out of the bathroom and I heard mayas sleepy voice, ‚ÄùBaby.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, it‚Äôs time to get up, the free breakfast ends at 9.‚Äù

She squealed with excitement, and started to get ready. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you downstairs baby I‚Äôm gonna get Mike‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOkayy.‚Äù

I headed out the door and across the hall, knocked three times and waited for a response. As the door squeaked open I greeted him .

‚ÄúHello there.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning good sir, would‚Äôth thow like to go for a dubious smoke? He was in a good mood and entertained, the best mood a michael could be in.¬†

‚ÄúOf course lad, lead the way.‚Äù He walked out of his room animated and to the side door, we marched out to the car and lit up.¬†

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to sleep for shit bro, i'm so tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúBet you‚Äôre glad we‚Äôre not doing a huge drive today though.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair, fair, I hope it is all gonna be over soon‚Äù I took a long drag and passed it to him.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù He grabbed it from me.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having vivid dreams again and debunking this should help. I think.‚Äù I looked at my lap as he finished it, I opened the door and started back inside since Maya would be there soon.¬†

We met in the lobby. I saw her eating waffles with a plate piled high, she made me smile, just by being her. Mike came and got his food, sausage and eggs, I got coffee and began planing the day‚Äôs journey. I sat down with my laptop and began research, checking every resource I have to try and find the address of the pig farm. I didn‚Äôt find much but a road name. ‚ÄúObsidian Drive.‚Äù I found it on google maps and closed the laptop, Mike was finished with his food, and maya was halfway to a food coma, leaving a 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 of the original waffles size.¬†

‚ÄúAlright lets go‚Äù I got up and threw away my empty coffee cup. Mike and Maya followed after me, and I made my way to the car. I got in the car and set up my maps, it‚Äôs just a matter of time now. My brain ached from last night, but I didn‚Äôt care, I need to be free of this burden. After Maya and Mike got it I started driving, it was miles on miles of corn field.After we got out of town there would be 10 minutes of driving straight down corn feild before the next road sign. It continued like this for hours, we drove down alabaster drive, the corn unending. We had been driving on this road for about 4 hours now, but no sign of the place I‚Äôm looking for.¬†

‚ÄúBaby, I think we‚Äôve seen this already, are we driving in a circle?‚Äù Maya groaned exhausted and a little annoyed. I looked out the window, corn. There was a little red shack though, that did look somewhat familiar.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so love, everything just looks the same out here.‚Äù I chimed back as I continued steering, I could never tell if something was going to pop out of the corn, it was so suffocating, hugging the road tight.¬†

Mike chimed in from the back, ‚ÄúAll this corn and still world hunger, that's crazy.‚Äù¬†

I laughed and shook my head,‚ÄùWe can‚Äôt even feed corn to hungry people, we don't digest it fully.‚Äù¬†

Maya looked over with a thinking face, ‚ÄúWell that's ironic.‚Äù

I smiled to myself, as I responded ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs American, we pick the most unhealthy fruit we possibly can and make it an industry. Vitamins, nutrients, minerals, and we choose to consume corn syrup, truly its gross.‚Äù I thought about all the different candies, sodas, and other confections we make with corn syrup.¬†

Mike took a hit of his vape, ‚ÄúOnly here could we grow diabetes.‚Äù¬†

I laughed and my attention shifted, my eyes hadn‚Äôt been on the road, my attention was on my thoughts, I could feel the world slow down around me. A moose stood in the middle of the road, inevitable, and built like a house. This is how it ends, I slammed on my brakes and swerved to the right, nearly sending us into the corn field but stopping just short as my panicked breathing started up. Maya and Mike shrieked as we stopped just short.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck babe!‚Äù Maya socked me in the shoulder with a dull thud.¬†

‚ÄúOw! Dammit, there was something in the road.‚Äù I looked back expecting to see the moose, but all I saw was the calm breeze blowing the corn too and fro.¬†

‚ÄúI didn't see anything! Be more careful next time!‚Äù She looked at me with confusion mixed with anger.¬†

‚ÄúSorry baby, we‚Äôre almost there, promise.‚Äù I started driving again, getting back on the road. The sun was hot, beating down on us a little after mid-day. The more I drove the more the road seemed to narrow somewhat. Maya fell asleep, and there were no other cars on the road, so I wasn‚Äôt worried. A few barns in a couple hours, it seemed like it was getting more and more sparse, in these backroads that‚Äôs how it is sometimes. It was about 4 pm and the road just kept getting more perilously narrow, the corn hugging the sides of the road almost groping the car as we drive in, almost like it was closing around us. Like the road was swallowing us as alive as we drove deeper.¬†

‚ÄúJesus dude, this road is fucked.‚Äù Mike observed the bleakness of the landscape and the condition of the dirt road. I was swerving potholes trying not to run into the corn. It was almost like the road itself was trying to stop us, maybe trying to tell us to turn back.¬†

My conviction was strong and hands were deft, I swerved through the road the shadows of the corn stalks darkening the road around me. As I thought the corn would fully block the road and consume us, the corn ended, the golden sun blinding me momentarily as it had been hidden for a while. Wheat.¬†

I saw golden wheat fields, to either the left or right, beautiful waving golden wheat. I kept on driving, sighing with exhaustion as I looked for what I knew would be there, an orchard. I drove for a mile, and then near the end of the street I could see a house with a silo. It looked different‚Ä¶ no orchard, just a green silo and a red pristine house. I didn‚Äôt recognize it, but it felt so similar. I had to see inside. I drove off the side of the road near it, turning off my lights and putting it in neutral as I approached, trying to be quiet just incase. Maya was still asleep, and I was not willing to endure the wrath of waking her after such a dubious journey. Me and Mike went ahead, he lit a cigarette as we walked up. We could see a window on the house, blank walls and well lit rooms. There was no sign of life but the inside looked clean.¬†

‚ÄúLooks empty Mike, what's the move?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought this was your plan genius, probably this.‚Äù He opened the door with no caution, cockily smiling as he did so. ‚ÄúEmpty, just like you said.‚Äù

He went in and I followed, it was strange, it was a perfectly kept house, but with no furniture, no art, no signs of life at all. It was all a dull white gray except for a green door with a golden knocker, and a gold door handle. It was all freshly painted and smelled stale and stagnant.¬†

I talked to Mike in a low whisper ‚ÄúStrange, it's empty but seems new.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, there just being one door is creepy, put a couch or something.‚Äù

I looked around more, but just more empty space, I approached the second door.¬†

‚ÄúYou ready for this?‚Äù

I heard a little tremble in his voice ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù¬†

I was excited, but sick at the same time, my stomach roiling and folding in on itself at the implications of this, I grabbed the door knob and began to turn it.

It's walled off, nothing but a brick wall covering a 4ft tall Semi-circle entrance. I couldn't believe it.¬†¬†

Mike protested with disappointment ‚ÄúReally dude?! I thought there would be something at least.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but when he shouted there was a noise, a shuffling, but when covered by his voice it sounded like a figment of my imagination, plus my mind was playing tricks on me anyways. We went back to the car and headed back to the hotel, the street that seemed to consume the car now just your regular dirt road. All this is just too much, if I dont write it down I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose it. To whomever is reading. Thank you. Without you I wouldn't be able to take it, the weight of this thing, this sickening force on my mind. The sleep deprivation is getting to me, it‚Äôs currently 3 AM and Maya is passed out next to me in bed. I wish I could tell them the severity of this curse, but they don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôre going back tomorrow, Maya isn‚Äôt too happy about it, but Mike is up for the challenge, and this thing isn‚Äôt done with me yet.

I only mention this because I often find myself looking out at the night sky, fairly uninterrupted. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs exactly National Geographic, I‚Äôm just saying I enjoy the nice view of the park and the little street of shops down below before bed.

But I haven't slept for three nights now, and it's all because of the goddamn castle floating right outside my bedroom window. 

Yeah, you heard that right. A castle. Big, gray, medieval if I had to describe it. Complete with towers and fluttering flags.¬†

It appeared on the first night, out of nowhere, like some ghost story no one told me I was in. 

I thought it was a dream. You know, the kind of dream where everything feels so vividly absurd you wake up laughing or shaking your head, swearing off late-night burritos.

So I closed the curtain and went back to bed.

But the next morning, as I dragged my ass to Kaldi's for my usual coffee, there it was. Still hanging up in the sky, like a hallucination that had decided to stick around for breakfast. I could feel it up there, its shadow stretching over my building, though nobody else seemed to notice.

On the second night, I remember hearing banging on my window. A sharp, deliberate sound like someone tapping with their knuckles or throwing small stones. It came in bursts, insistent enough to wake me but not quite enough to make me get out of bed.¬†

I just lay there, the blankets bunched in my fists, my eyes squeezed shut, too freaked out to look. My heart thudded so loudly I thought it might drown out the banging altogether, and eventually, it did.¬†

I told myself it was just my mind playing tricks, or maybe some loose branch brushing against the glass. But something about it. The pattern, the persistence. It made my skin crawl.¬†

Last night, the banging on my window returned. It was softer at first, but quickly grew more insistent, demanding.¬†

My hands were clammy, my heart hammering in my chest. I knew I couldn‚Äôt ignore it forever. I had to know what was out there. So, with a deep breath, I stood up, my legs shaky, and walked to the window. Slowly, I pulled the curtain aside, just an inch, just enough to peek through.

What I saw made my heart nearly stop.¬†

There, hovering just outside my window, were two figures.¬†They looked‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to say it‚Ä¶ like miniature dolphins with arms‚Ä¶ standing upright in black space suits.

Their skin seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. And their eyes were large, dark, and unblinking, fixed directly on me. They were standing on a floating red carpet, which hovered steadily in mid-air.¬†

They looked like they were waiting for me to do something.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry, my heart pounding in my ears. They didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound. They just waited. I took a deep breath, then reached out and unlatched the window, pushing it open. The cold night air rushed in, making me shiver.

One of the figures stepped forward, inclining its head slightly. When it spoke, its voice was smooth, almost melodic. But it was just inaudible noises. 

Clicks and whistles.

The other dolphin figure suddenly clicked and whistled.

The main dolphin that was just speaking to me nodded, then used his hand to change a setting on his spacesuit. 

It spoke again, but this time I could understand him. ""By royal decree, you are hereby invited to dine with His Majesty tomorrow night, to discuss your opinion on Earth before its destruction.""

The other figure reached into a fold of its robe and produced a small, glossy invitation, which it handed to me. I took it, my hands trembling, and before I could say anything, they both nodded, then rose up on their floating carpet, drifting away into the night sky.

I stood there for a long moment, staring at the invitation in my hand. My mind was reeling, my body frozen. A royal decree? Dinner with a king? What the hell was happening?

This morning, I went to Kaldi's, my head spinning, convinced I was having a complete mental breakdown. I kept my eyes down, avoiding everyone, the invitation tucked into my jacket pocket. I ordered my usual cold brew, barely able to focus on the barista as she took my order.

While I was waiting, she came over, holding my drink and glancing at something in her hand. ""Hey, this is yours, right?"" she asked, her eyes wide with curiosity. I looked down and saw she was holding the invitation.

My stomach dropped.

""Uh, yeah,"" I muttered, reaching for it. She handed it over, a grin spreading across her face.

""This is rad. Some kind of art thing?""

I forced a smile, my heart pounding. ""Something like that,"" I said, taking the invitation and my drink, my hands trembling. I could feel her eyes on me as I turned away, the weight of the invitation suddenly all too real.

I found a seat in the corner, my mind racing.

Maybe I'm not losing it. Maybe this is actually happening. The castle, the figures, the invitation‚Äîit all feels impossible, but it's all been right in front of me. And tonight, I‚Äôm supposed to meet a king.

Some part of me still thinks I should check myself into the loony bin if I hear them banging on the window again tonight.",1,1728358671.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

There are variations, of course, but these usually commingle my former and present lives in deeply unsettling ways. In this particular one, I was presenting the disappointing quarterly results of my portfolio to the investment committee and other members of my old firm. I was standing at the conference table, dressed in a suit and tie from the waist up, but instead of pants I was wearing pink tights, my cock pushing out obscenely through the sheer fabric. Ridiculously, I was also wearing black dress shoes.  Our CEO was present as well as Mason, of course. So was Daphne, as my administrative assistant, sitting next to where I was standing, a pile of papers and a leather strap resting on the table in front of her.

When I finished my presentation, our CEO said: ‚ÄúTotally unacceptable results, Hathaway. And your sausage and chestnut stuffing sucked. Bottom quartile without a doubt.‚Äù

Mason added, ‚ÄúThe turkey he served us was undercooked. He could have killed us all.‚Äù

Our CEO: ‚ÄúDaphne, please hand the punishment strap to Mason.‚Äù

‚ÄúGladly, sir,‚Äù said my secretary/niece, handing it to him.

‚ÄúAssume the position. Hathaway,‚Äù ordered Mason. 

‚ÄúBut the meat thermometer read 175 degrees. The turkey should have been done!‚Äù I protested.

‚ÄúShut up, you incompetent fairy,‚Äù said Mason.

And then the alarm went off. Saved by the bell, I suppose. The only problem was that I was waking up into a no less unsettling reality. And having been up until almost midnight, serving Mason and Natalie, I could have used more sleep, nightmare-laden or not. 

I now slept in the mansion‚Äôs maid‚Äôs quarters, a claustrophobic, spartan, windowless room with a small closet. The mansion was constructed in 1894, during the height of the Gilded Age, and had been renovated multiple times. Quarters for a live-in maid was a big selling point for Natalie and me when we purchased the mansion a decade ago. Indeed, the room was consecutively occupied by two live-in maids, both slender young women, from the time we moved in until I displaced the second maid, Lorena, in March of this year. I was not disappointed when our first maid resigned six years ago, as it gave us the opportunity to hire a younger, more attractive replacement in Lorena, a recent immigrant from Brazil who was still learning English at the time.

 I enjoyed ogling Lorena as she dusted, vacuumed and mopped around the mansion in the traditional maid‚Äôs uniform that we required her to wear. It surprised me at the time that Natalie consented to hiring such a comely, even sexy young woman, but in retrospect, it should not have: Natalie was not the least bit jealous of me being attracted to other women as she no longer had the slightest interest in me, romantically or sexually (if she ever did, which I have come increasingly to doubt). In fact, I suspected that Natalie herself enjoyed watching our nubile young maid at work. In addition, Lorena connected well with Ryan, who was 12 years old when we hired her and still two years away from leaving for boarding school. I tried not to be too obvious in leering at Lorena, but she caught me on more than one occasion. I had the feeling at the time that she deeply resented it, but there was really not much she could do about it. Natalie and I had agreed to sponsor her for US citizenship, which would have been jeopardized had she left our employment. 

Today, Lorena is 23 years old, a US citizen, and her English is quite good. She is still in Natalie‚Äôs employ as a live-in housekeeper, but now occupies a much larger bedroom on the second floor of the mansion. As the junior maid of the household, I now report to her. In reality, Lorena does very little actual work around the mansion these days, except for helping out before, during and after large parties, or on other special occasions. She doesn‚Äôt even wear a maid‚Äôs uniform anymore, except on these occasions, instead dressing in shorts, jeans or other casual clothes. Her primary function nowadays is to supervise, and to occasionally discipline, me. I sometimes suspect that she may have other, more intimate responsibilities with Natalie and Mason as well. I have now caught Lorena ogling me as I work in my uniform several times, but in contrast to me, she makes no attempt to hide it when I catch her and instead simply smiles at me knowingly. It is now I who am powerless to do anything about it.

I gave little thought to the dreariness of the maid‚Äôs quarters when it was occupied by Lorena and her predecessor. At least it has a small en-suite bathroom, with a toilet, a small, round sink and a narrow shower, so I can attend to my personal needs apart from my superiors. Unless one of them chooses to be present, of course, such as Daphne overseeing my corset training. The small medicine cabinet behind the mirror contains my meager supply of toiletries, including my depilatory creams and shavers. Although I receive monthly full body waxes at the salon on Main Street, including a Brazilian wax, I am expected to remove all stubble on a daily basis or face severe punishment. 

The bedroom also has a small dresser, which holds my panties, stockings, chemises, camisoles, leotards, yoga pants and so forth. A shoe rack sits next to the dresser, where I store my three pairs of high heels, two pairs of flats and the tattered Converse sneakers that I wear when doing yard work. Hanging ominously on the wall are various instruments of correction: riding crop, tawse, paddle, prison strap (the very one featured in my nightmare), and three rattan canes, including the thin, yet lethal whippy dragon cane. Given the proximity of these implements to my bed, it is no wonder that they regularly invade my sleep. In the closet hang my most frequently used maid‚Äôs uniforms: the scullery maid uniform I have already described; a shorter, blue working maid‚Äôs uniform resembling those used by hotel maids; three black and white, formal, serving maid uniforms, one longer, one quite short and one in between; two black and white uniforms for day-to-day service and light cleaning; and a ridiculously short French maid uniform such as a sexy young woman might wear at Halloween, albeit of finer quality. Natalie has purchased me several other maid uniforms as well, too many to fit in my small closet. Kept in a large storage closet in the basement, these are mostly holiday specific and quite colorful. They are growing in number with each passing holiday (for example, on Halloween, I served dinner in a satin orange uniform, with black trim, apron and petticoats and black fishnet stockings), and I am very concerned about what Natalie might come up with for Christmas. I say that she ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù these uniforms, but the fact of the matter is that they were all custom made by the same tailors (a husband and wife in their late fifties) who altered my wedding tuxedo when I married Natalie and countless of my suits and her dresses over the years.

As I dressed that morning, I thought back to the first time I visited them following my change in circumstances in mid April. Mason and Natalie accompanied me to their small shop beneath their home in Port Chester. My wife and her lover were dressed smartly (she in a lavender dress, white stockings and heels and Mason in polo shirt, khakis and the brown leather loafers I had polished that very morning), while I was wearing old sweatpants, a threadbare T-shirt, and a pair of ratty Converse sneakers. I deferentially walked three feet behind Natalie and Mason as they entered the shop, arm in arm, essentially hidden from sight as I was shorter than both of them. 

‚ÄúHello, Mrs. Hathaway! We haven‚Äôt seen you in ages,‚Äù said Gina, the seamstress wife. 

‚ÄúHi Gina. It‚Äôs great to see you. Please meet Mason Draper.‚Äù After Mason firmly shook hands with Gina and her husband, Lou, who had just entered the room, Natalie continued, ‚ÄúWe need you and Lou to design several maid uniforms for Henry here. Henry, show yourself!‚Äù Natalie commanded me, sharply. I sheepishly walked forward. I could not meet the couple‚Äôs eyes, so stared down at the linoleum floor.

‚ÄúMr. Hathaway?!‚Äù exclaimed Gina, incredulously. ‚ÄúI barely recognize you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Natalie. ‚ÄúI assume that we can count on your discretion, Gina and Lou. We‚Äôll make this job well worth your while and there will undoubtedly be lots of future work as well, but we need for you to keep this strictly confidential.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, you can count on us, Mrs. Hathaway! We haven‚Äôt been in business for over 30 years without being discreet,‚Äù said Lou.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù said Natalie. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I heard you right. I thought you said you want us to design several maid uniforms FOR Mr. Hathaway,‚Äù said Lou.

‚ÄúYou heard me exactly right, Lou. And just call him Henry from now on. You see, there have been some big changes in our lives recently. Out of the blue, Henry announced to me last month that he has been a closet transvestite for many, many years. From even before we were married. You can imagine the betrayal I must have felt,‚Äù she said, a solemn expression on her face.

I looked up to see the shocked expressions of Lou and Gina.

‚ÄúHow awful, Mrs. Hathaway,‚Äù said Gina.

‚ÄúYes, it really has been. But that‚Äôs not all. When Henry made this shameful confession to me, he said that for many years all he has dreamed about is being a submissive maid to me and a real man. That‚Äôs where Mason comes in. Henry and he used to work with each other, so I have known him for a long time. Mason and I had feelings for one another, but I could never have violated my marital vows, of course. But everything changed after Henry‚Äôs confession. He said his life as an investment professional had been a complete lie, and that could no longer maintain the charade. He said his only desire was to spend the rest of days living a life of humble, selfless service. He then literally got down on his knees and begged me to turn him into my domestic, into my feminized maid. So he could, at long last, be his true self. Isn‚Äôt that right, Henry?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam. Every word is true,‚Äù I replied, continuing to gaze at the floor. 

‚ÄúA ‚Äòsissy maid‚Äô is what they call it in the psychological literature. I‚Äôve had to give myself a crash course in this‚Ä¶this disorder, over the last couple of months.‚Äù

Gina clucked her tongue with disapproval. I could feel her staring at me with contempt.

Natalie continued, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always been a broad minded thinker. I pride myself on that. If it‚Äôs in my power to help Henry be true to himself, to allow him to be what he‚Äôs dreamed of being for so long, well I must do that, of course. After all, I‚Äôve had affection for this man for 20 years of marriage. How could I be so heartless as to deny him his deepest desire, his greatest wish, even if it is quite perverted? The poor men who are afflicted by these disorders really can‚Äôt help themselves, I‚Äôve learned. So, he resigned his position last month.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard about that,‚Äù Lou interrupted.

‚ÄúHe has resigned from the firm,‚Äù Natalie continued, ‚Äúand Mason and I are now together, and we have agreed to allow Henry to live with us as our maid. That‚Äôs where the two of YOU come in. A proper maid needs the proper attire. The clothes are very important to men such as Henry. Well, I use the word ‚Äòmen‚Äô advisedly, but you know what I mean,‚Äù Natalie said with an ostensibly rueful, little laugh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a better woman than I am, Mrs. Hathaway,‚Äù said Gina. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I could do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFortunately, you won‚Äôt ever have to,‚Äù scoffed Lou, looking at me with derision.

‚ÄúMason and I are very much in love. So, as difficult as this has all been for me, it‚Äôs really a win-win situation for everyone involved.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you have a teenage son with your husband, Mrs. Hathaway?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he‚Äôs been away at boarding school in England and doesn‚Äôt know about any of this yet. We want to break it to him in person when he comes home for the holidays. But I raised him to be a broad minded thinker as well, and he‚Äôs now a legal adult. Knowing Ryan, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll support his father‚Äôs deep seated need to make this transition.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he actually going to transition into becoming a woman? You know, the hormones and all?‚Äù asked Gina.

‚ÄúA very astute question, Gina. We‚Äôre still working through that,‚Äù Natalie said, momentarily making eye contact with me. ‚ÄúBut you can appreciate the heightened need for confidentiality until we talk with our son in person. Now, we‚Äôre going to need five uniforms to start‚Ä¶‚Äù

Natalie went on to lay out the specifications for four of the seven uniforms now hanging in my closet as well as the one I had just put on in the midst of these recollections. That day at the shop, Mason ordered me to remove my T-shirt, sweatpants and sneakers, so that I stood in the middle of the room wearing nothing but a skimpy pair of yellow nylon panties, as Lou took my measurements. The profound shame I experienced as he wrapped the measuring tape around my body parts while the others looked on, caused me to become fully erect in my panties.

Natalie gave a masterful performance that day, one that she reprised again and again with others we know. And the show goes on... She had done some acting in college, and it was apparent that she hadn‚Äôt lost her touch. Indeed, the version of events she told to Gina and Lou ‚Äì portraying herself as the victimized, yet liberal thinking and magnanimous wife and me as the deceitful, submissive, perverted husband ‚Äì became the standard version conveyed to nearly everyone outside of our family and Scott the IT guy and his wife, of course. Mason is excellent in his supporting actor role. It is crucial that the number of people who know of my financial improprieties be kept to the bare minimum. People cannot help but admire a woman so wronged, yet still willing to help the man who wronged her live the pathetic life he believes he was meant to live. So any humiliations this wretched man suffers are ones he richly deserves (and secretly craves anyhow). The genius of Mason‚Äôs and Natalie‚Äôs version of how I became their feminized servant is that it establishes a permission structure for others to pile on the humiliation. They are actually doing me a favor! 

Well, let‚Äôs just say people now like to do me a lot of favors. I have come to realize that the arrogant, in some cases even abusive, ways I treated many, if not most, of the people in my circle prior to my downfall plays no small part in their eagerness to contribute to my increasingly public humiliation. It does not seem to matter that my humiliations and punishments are out of proportion (sometimes wildly so, in my humble opinion) to my original slights or misdeeds. Grievance is a powerful emotion that grows like a cancer, especially when those experiencing it believe the target of their revenge not only deserves it, but on some level actually desires it. And, in general, people just really enjoy watching the mighty fall. 

That morning, I had to shake off the lingering effects of my nightmare and my musings on the recent past to focus on the immediate tasks at hand: cleaning the downstairs powder room and working on my mushroom soup ‚Äì Daphne had said it lacked depth of flavor when she tried it yesterday ‚Äì before serving Mason and Natalie breakfast at 8 AM. Having done very little cooking in my life prior to six months ago, I had tremendous anxiety about Thanksgiving dinner (as my nightmare was evidence). Mason and Natalie made it clear to me that their expectations for the meal, both food and service, were extremely high. I had no doubt that the consequences to me for failing to meet them would be dire.

After cleaning the bathroom, I washed my hands carefully and prepared another test batch of mushroom soup, this time substituting shallots for onion and adding more heavy cream than called for in the recipe. I was set to serve this dish along with a few others to Daphne and her girlfriends the next evening. 

Mason was the first to enter the kitchen, still in his bathrobe and slippers. He is 6 feet tall, with thick, dark brown hair and an athletic build (he is avid tennis player and spends a lot of time in the gym).

‚ÄúGood morning, Master. I hope you slept well,‚Äù I said, curtsying to him.

‚ÄúI slept like a baby. Your lovely wife wore me out. Her stamina is amazing. I didn‚Äôt even punish you last night, and she still couldn‚Äôt get enough. When I put you through your paces, she‚Äôs like a wild animal.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very glad to hear that you‚Äôre well rested, sir. What would you like for breakfast?‚Äù I said as I poured his cup of coffee.

‚ÄúWait till your mistress comes down. I‚Äôm thinking steak and eggs, but it‚Äôs up to Natalie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. While you wait, sir, would you care for a cup of mushroom soup? I‚Äôm trying to perfect the recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. Miss Daphne found Julia Child‚Äôs recipe wanting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be your goddamned guinea pig, Hathaway. Let Daphne and her friends be your taste testers. All I care about is that the soup, and everything else, be fucking delicious on Thanksgiving. They‚Äôd better be, for your sake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù I replied, just as Natalie entered the room, still wearing her short, silk chemise nightgown. I felt my cock twitch in its cage as I glanced at her long legs. I knew better than to gaze too long at the woman who is my wife in name only, so quickly averted my eyes.

‚ÄúDarling, why do you persist in calling him Hathaway? You really should be calling him Henrietta, or maid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, baby. It‚Äôs just that I called him Henry or Hathaway for so many years at the office. Old habits die hard, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, Mistress,‚Äù I said, with the obligatory curtsy.

‚ÄúGet me a cup of coffee,‚Äù she responded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starving. After last night, I don‚Äôt even have to work out in the gym today,‚Äù she said, winking at Mason.

‚ÄúWould steak and eggs be acceptable for breakfast, Mistress? Master Mason suggested it,‚Äù I asked as I handed the cup to her, curtsying.

You may note my highly formalized way of addressing my superiors. That is certainly not the way I used to talk in my former life. However, when Mason and Natalie informed me back in March that I would be making a career transition from hedge fund executive to maid, they made it clear that I needed to learn all of the proper maid etiquette, including how to properly address my superiors. I read many books and articles as part of my comprehensive reeducation.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Natalie answered. 

‚ÄúMistress, Master, would it permissible for me to cook myself an egg after I serve you breakfast? I haven‚Äôt had any in two weeks.‚Äù I love eggs, but Natalie forbid me from having any without her explicit permission a month ago after I gained two pounds during my weekly weigh-in. My corset training was only one of the methods being used to help me achieve the figure Natalie thought appropriate for a maid; I was also on a fairly strict diet. It was enforced by Lorena. I actually saw her counting the eggs one morning, so did not dare try to sneak one while nobody was around.

‚ÄúI guess so, Henrietta. Only one,‚Äù she answered.

‚ÄúThank you, Mistress, you are too kind,‚Äù I said, this time with a somewhat deeper curtsy to acknowledge her generosity.

After I served their plates, Mason said to me, ‚ÄúMy right foot is still bothering me. Massage.‚Äù He snapped his fingers and extended his foot, looking briefly at his foot but not at me.

I immediately dropped to my knees on the hard tile floor, removed his slipper and began kneading the sole his large, meaty bare foot, as he and Natalie enjoyed their steak and eggs. Except for a cracker that I ate with my cholesterol medication, I had not yet eaten, so my mouth was watering at the smell of their food. There was only a trace of the callous on the ball of his foot that I had removed three days earlier. It took an hour of rubbing with a pumice stone, soaking in water and applying moisturizing lotion, but it seemed to do the trick. What I hated the most about foot massages, floor scrubbing and other such labor on my knees was the discomfort (sometimes even pain) of my 44 year-old knees grinding into the hard floor (except for some expensive rugs scattered about, most rooms in the mansion had mahogany wood floors); my nylon stockings obviously provided almost no cushion. I was planning on requesting knee pads, but I knew from experience that I had to pick my spots carefully for such requests, moments when Natalie and Mason were in a particularly good mood. Perhaps if my Thanksgiving dinner was a big success‚Ä¶ My chances were slightly better with Natalie, but she had increasingly been deferring to Mason (‚ÄúAsk your master.‚Äù); I believe she enjoyed watching him turn me down (he was aware of that, which, of course, only increased the probability of him denying my requests).

‚ÄúLook at you, darling, you‚Äôre such an alpha,‚Äù Natalie said, getting up and sitting on Mason‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve really broken him, haven‚Äôt you? You‚Äôve turned your rival into your maid, and he‚Äôs kneeling at your feet as you make his wife very, very happy.‚Äù She started kissing him, passionately. 

‚ÄúYou make me very happy, too, baby,‚Äù Mason said, continuing to kiss her. He started fingering her hard nipple through her chemise with one hand while his other hand was wrapped around her waist.

Natalie broke off her kiss again, with a wet lip smacking sound, to address me: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a real man‚Äôs foot, isn‚Äôt it, maid? Make my man‚Äôs foot feel good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mistresses. I‚Äôm trying,‚Äù I replied, pushing more vigorously with my fingers. 

‚ÄúKiss your master‚Äôs feet, maid. Thank him keeping your mistress happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mistress. Thank you, Master‚Äù‚Ä¶kiss...‚ÄùFor giving Mistress Natalie‚Äù‚Ä¶kiss‚Ä¶‚Äùwhat I never could‚Äù‚Ä¶kiss.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so wet,‚Äù Mason said, his hand moving beneath Natalie‚Äôs chemise. 

‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôre not going to believe this, but I think I‚Äôm ready to go again,‚Äù Natalie said. With that, he stood up, wiped his wet fingers on my hair, picked Natalie up and hoisted her over his shoulder, playfully smacking her ass, and walked out of the room in the direction of the stairs. 

I got up, straightened the seams of my stockings, and cleaned the table. I was sure looking forward to that egg.",1,1728358142.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

* schools dont matter hugely as we homeschool
* has land in area suitable for small farm w/ livestock (chickens, ducks, goats, etc, nothing crazy)
* no big risk for natural disasters, so no lower coastal states, no obvious tornado states, etc
* mild weather with nothing too crazy for winter and not crazy humid/hot in summer
* low crime rate in and surrounding
* good real estate options, prefer to buy house with land, no time to waste with building
* good medical care within decent driving distance
* Local farmers and crafting markets would be amazing too

Any women reading will get this, I'm just wanting somewhere cozy where I can go to the local coffee shop in the AM and see the same people, sit and read or crochet or reddit lurk, local food sourced restaurants, a bookshop..or 4...cant ever have too many, (yes yes I know this is ALL such a stretch but I am SOOO hopeful haha), a park or two for the kids.  My inspiration is mostly the small UK towns, where things are all close together with walking paths in town, not a lot of tourists, cozy fall vibes, etc.

Not concerned with house listings now as it will be a bit until we move unless we hit the lottery but just want to get personal recommendations and expand my search area and have no clue where to start.  I know all the cutesy towns on the ""cutest town"" lists are super touristy usually and it isnt all like it appears from the biased real estate and tourist board advertising.

List away if you can, I'm excited over having something to obsess over haha.",1,1728357944.0,RealEstate,2,0.67,False
1fyqird,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyqird,Help with living room layout and decor!,"Hello all! I recently made a post asking for advice regarding the height of a mirror I just hung up and have received a lot of feedback which opened my eyes to other issues with the current layout of my living room (thanks again to those who commented)!

I decided to make another post showing the entire room and open up the debate to the whole layout and overall decor instead of limiting the discussion to the mirror height.

Some context:
- I rent, so I cannot make any renovations or structural changes to the home.
- I just moved which is why there aren‚Äôt any personal items or pictures up yet!
- This is not my forever home so I‚Äôd really like to work with the bigger pieces I have if possible (blue couch, orange chair + ottoman, console table, lamp, desk, piano, and bar cart).
- Open to swapping out the rug and coffee table, and definitely would like to find a better substitute for the bookshelf next to the chair.
- Would love to make the mirror work in this space but I‚Äôm open to moving it to another room if need be.
- Minor note: I‚Äôm in the process of knitting a rust/orange blanket which will replace the pink one that‚Äôs currently on the couch.

Thank you all in advance!! I really appreciate any constructive feedback!",1,1728357820.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

It was a long conversation, but she somehow got into the topic of Papa Roach's and Carrie Underwood's new song on the subject (no, she had no idea it was on my mind: we were just making smalltalk).  So that was weird.

Then I drove to the store to get the supplies, and this truck cuts me off in the parking lot.  I was just done at this point, laid on the horn and flipped him off.  He looked like he wanted to bite my face off, and I was all for it, thinking, *What do I have to lose?  In fact, I'd love to experience a real fist fight before I die.  Maybe I'll even get lucky and he'll pull a gun.* (Dude was driving a pickup truck, in Alabama, and irate, so it was a somewhat possible possibility).

Anyway, as much as I tried to antagonize him, nothing came of it, but when I entered the store, I was so flustered I couldn't remember what I needed, and when I searched, I couldn't find any of it.  I had thought everything was pretty generic hardware store ingredients, but I guess my source was outdated.

Anyway, I eventually just gave up and ended up just buying winemaking supplies instead because I used to love making wine but dropped off.  Now I have 5 gallons going haha.  Love the smell (not sarcasm).

So... now what?  I was trying another method I won't specify, but I can't get it to work right, like I just wasn't built to do it properly, maybe.

I am on the more fit side, I‚Äôm pretty lean, have well defined muscles and probably around 15% body fat. I used to be about 40 pounds heavier and lost the weight pretty simply.

My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller.

Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn‚Äôt losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds.

I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don‚Äôt make comments on what she‚Äôs eating as she‚Äôs eating it. I agreed.

Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a ‚Äúreward‚Äù for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories.

At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she‚Äôll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn‚Äôt going to guarantee she‚Äôll lose weight.

She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn‚Äôt helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.

She doesn‚Äôt try to hide their relationship or anything like that and I‚Äôm not concerned that she would do anything to break my trust as we‚Äôve spoken about how anti cheating we are and what we would consider cheating etc etc but I know what some guys are like and it‚Äôs probably more that I don‚Äôt trust him?

Coates is a proud and unapologetically black man. He knows his story and knows how to tell it. It‚Äôs that skill (with a healthy dollop of white guilt) that helped propel his memoir ‚ÄúBetween the World and Me‚Äù to the top of the charts and to the bookshelves and coffee tables of progressive Americans everywhere. 

With the help of his publicist he somehow became the intermediary between wealthy white liberals America and black America. He sells a story about a dark, bloodstained and mostly irredeemable america for the people that want to be told it. He articulated the deep sense of grievance some black Americans felt and the liberal world feted him endlessly. 


Unfortunately it seems that‚Äôs went to his head because now he has the balls to speak on the Palestine Israel conflict. The book itself is laughably bad, overwrought (a problem I have with all of his works) and insanely under thought. Coates seems to delude himself into thinking his experience as a black man and a brief tour organized by Palestinian activists gives him the right to lecture Israel on its right to exist or how it needs to reshape its society. 

Something he would surely never grant an outsider coming into his community. Especially if he/she was white. The hypocrisy is just maddening. He constantly makes the comparison to South Africa and Jim Crow and yet never once speaks to any of the Arab Jews in Israel, whose sole reason for being their is their own expulsion from various Muslims nations in the Middle East, about what they think of Israel. Which is funny because I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre plenty ‚Äúdark‚Äù enough for Coates to trust them over a white, European looking Jew. 

Why? Because he‚Äôs decided this is a conflict with only one good side. He never asks why you can find Arabs parties in the Knesset but no Jewish parties anywhere else in the Muslim world. Why you can find Muslims praying at mosques built, via religious imperialism, on the bones of an older synagogue in Jerusalem but nary a Jew or Christian in sight of Mecca. Holy cities are for sharing only when they‚Äôre held by non Muslims to him apparently. 

More damningly, he never interrogates why the only Jewish nation in existence is a problem but the numerous explicitly Muslim (most of the Middle East) or Christian nations (the UK or Denmark). If I was him reviewing a white man‚Äôs critique of North African or middle eastern nations that would be proof enough to call him a closer white nationalist or at the very least, deeply racist. 

He‚Äôs a hack writer whose weak prose is on even more display today then it was a decade ago, an anti-Semite and a useful idiot for those seeking to destroy Israel. ",0,1728356761.0,changemyview,48,0.39,False

Anyway, I was just sneaking out with my bag when my wife mentions that I need to pick up some s‚Äômores stuff from the store while I‚Äôm out since we‚Äôre going to have a backyard camp out.  In any case, I run by the local Giant Eagle and grab everything the minute they open at 7. And since it was right when it opened it took forever to check out as the scanners were booting up and the registers didn‚Äôt have their drawers. Anyway, now I‚Äôm cutting it close. I pull up to the bag drop and get out and then it hits me- a chilly, wet, awful gust and I‚Äôm just wearing a thin-ish q-zip. I don‚Äôt have time to drive home and get another layer.

I decided to get a coffee at the snack bar to try to keep warm, but decided against it based on my nerves. So I got a hot chocolate. I took a walk outside to drop off my wallet and lock the car, and then I realized I had a whole bag of marshmallows. I grabbed the bag, locked the car, and hopped into my cart. I walk up, ice cold (both athletically and temperature-wise) and proceed to slash the worst hozzlerocket known to man. It skids completely sideways, hitting a yawning cart boy at the return who was just minding his business. And I hit him in the nuts. Now I‚Äôm really frazzled. I manage to granny-swing a jizzy little poot of a drive about 175 yards. The round gets worse. I‚Äôm cold and in my anxious state forgot about the cocoa. So i, in my frustration, grabbed the styrofoam cup, and tore the bag of marshmallows open with my teeth, bit one out of the hole, then made to shake a few into my now open cocoa cup. 

Then disaster struck. Halfway down the fairway on 4 I hit an uneven patch of concrete cart path and my cart jumped and I spilled hot chocolate on my dick. This made me swerve the cart, spilling it, and me onto the fairway.

I was so embarrassed that I lifted the cart upright by myself, picked up my scattered clubs, cocoa cup, marshmallow bag, and my pride- and called it quits for the day!

I'm moving into an old 2-floor townhouse unit that was previously occupied by a family that heavily lived on Indian cooking for many years. The first time I stepped into that unit the Indian spice/curry smell was very heavy, to the point of it literally lingered in my throat for the day and gave me tears. This is because they've moved out about half a year prior and the unit windows were kept shut. But the landlord has since then completely redone the entire wooden flooring and double layer painted all the walls but **without washing them first**! The landlord did not replace all of the kitchen cupboards, stove and range hood but has hired someone to deep clean them. Even though, the smell of the cupboards was at first strong regardless due to inactivity and concealment.

This is what I've done to the place since I got the keys to the unit:

* Sprayed all kitchen cupboards and stove inside and out, range hood, fridge and kitchen walls/ceiling with 50% white vinegar 50% water solution, then wiped them all. Did this whole process **twice in a week.** The curry smell emitting from the cupboards was drastically reduced.
* Hand washed the **entire** unit's walls and doors, both floors with 33% clear dish soap, 33% white vinegar and 33% water solution. Did not wash most of the ceilings as it's got popcorn ceiling.
* Placed bowls of white vinegar in just about every room to soak up the smell.
* Placed two air purifiers working almost around the clock on the first floor where the smell is the strongest, while kept second floor windows open for days for air flow.

Now the unit, upon walking in, just smells like a mix of a bit of bitterness and vinegar, ""sour curry"", so to speak, but the smell is nowhere near as strong as before. With the problem of walls being re-pained **without washing them first,** I think my only resort is to keep cooking and masking the curry odor by various means. Unfortunately, redoing paint again or ozone machines are out of the question in my situation. I don't know if ozone machines would even work when some curry odor is trapped under the new paint and would constantly re-emit into the room through the new paint. So my question is, what methods are good for masking the smell of my new unit? I'm thinking about placing bowls of coffee grounds and probably light up incense around the home daily. Would spraying peppermint oil and water mix on the walIs be helpful? Just want to introduce a new type of smell to get trapped into the walls to finally cover up the curry smell.",0,1728354581.0,HomeImprovement,4,0.5,False
1fypi6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo50/comments/1fypi6a/some_help_for_ninpek/,Some help for Ninpek,"Ninpek is my fifth win. I'm aware that there are many games tougher than it in this collection, but I found this title to be particularly agonizing. It's fair, but it demands a lot of coordination and memory from the player, two skills I am lacking in. However, I have some tips worth sharing, some I don't see being talked about on this subreddit. I actually followed some poor advice about this game that ended up making the whole thing a lot harder than it should've been. So here is some pointers for anyone struggling.

The basics: Just hold the shoot button the whole time. You can press down B to drop down to lower levels. You acquire shurikens to raise your rate of fire, you can upgrade this twice..

Sandwich spawning: Sandwiches work much in the same way as coffees do in Campenlla. You need to place your character in a specific spot in order for them to spawn. You need three sandwiches to get the gift, but also they supply 500 points which is essential to success in this game. You need to memorize these spawns. There's a sandwich for about every minute of gameplay. While you don't need to get all of them, you do need to try and get as many as you can, and create a system for which ones you can get consistently every run. Why? 

Extra life spawning: Extra lives spawn based on your score, they do not spawn randomly. The first extra life you get spawns at the same spot every time, but the rest all come at certain points scored. The extra lives spawn at 3,000, 7,000, 12,000, 18,000 and so on. This is why the sandwiches are so important, they act as a quick shortcut to getting more lives. Maximizing score is essential to beating Ninpek and getting the cherry.

Be aggressive: Other tips I see online say to be conservative, to play it safe. Screw that, collect them points, don't leave money on the table. Try to maximize your kills especially at the start when things are at their chilliest. Learn what enemies drop extra points and get familiar with killing them and collecting their points. The purple bouncy umbrella things will often drop crowns if killed near the edge of the screen which will reward you with a ton points. Hopefully you can get enough lives so that you can survive the few minutes of the game which I found to be brutal.

Would appreciate any suggestions and also advice on what to wear in each location.

We're going for 4 nights:

# Thusday

**Landing at 9 AM**

* Pick up the rental car and head to **Stanley Park** to explore, and maybe check out **Lions Gate Bridge**.
* Thinking of renting e-bikes (maybe from **Yes Cycle** or on Denman Street) and just biking around looking out for some of the sights in the park

**Hotel check-in at 3 PM** (staying near Coal Harbor), freshen up, then off to **Granville Island**.

**Granville Island**

Not quite sure what to do on Granville Island other than eat! Reddit recommends:

* **Chai tea** from Granville Island Tea Company
* **Duck prosciutto** from Oyama Sausage
* **Brie** from Benton Brothers
* **Pad Thai** from Sen Pad Thai
* **Oysters** from Lobster Man
* **Lee‚Äôs Donuts**
* Any other must-try spots or hidden gems here? Worth visiting the public market? Would appreciate food/activity recs or cool places to check out nearby!

# Friday

* **Capilano Suspension Bridge** (10 AM - 12 PM)
* **Ferry to Bowen Island** for the afternoon‚Äîplanning to rent e-bikes, explore the cove, and maybe hike. Any must-sees or local spots to check out? So far we're thinking:
   * Enjoy the trail walks near the cove, with a salmon ladder and waterfall to the right.
   * Visit memorial benches and hike up a bluff for views of Deep Bay.
   * Walk around **Killarney Lake** (\~40 mins), and check out the scenic bridge in the wetlands via Meadow Trail.
   * Rent e-bikes near the ferry terminal.
   * Hike to **Dorman Point**.
   * Explore **Snug Cove**, which has cool shops and restaurants like **Tell Your Friends Cafe**, **Elixr Coffee**, **Branch 01** (for tacos), and **Earnest Ice Cream**.
   * **Artisan Square** - more shops, including **Cocoa West** for amazing hot chocolate, and **Artisan Eats Cafe** for sausage rolls.

# Saturday

**Sea to Sky Gondola**, then heading to Whistler:

* **Superfly Ziplines**
* **Scandinave Spa** to unwind
* Finishing the night with **Vallea Lumina** before driving back to the hotel.
* Is this too ambitious for one day? We've booked a lot but I think we can do it all plus we'll get to chill at the spa for a few hours.

# Sunday

* **VanDusen Botanical Garden** in the morning.
* Considering a **ferry to Sunshine Coast** for a relaxed day trip but open to suggestions.
* Id probably want something more chill on this day given Saturday

# Monday

Chill day before catching our 2 PM flight. Any small activities or cool places near Coal Harbor we could explore before heading to the airport?

**General Questions:**

1. **What‚Äôs the weather like in Vancouver this time of year?** We‚Äôre thinking of wearing sweaters and waterproof coats, but don't want to overheat if it‚Äôs warm. Is layering the way to go?
2. **Is anything on our itinerary not worth it?** Any spots we should swap out for something better?
3. Any **packing tips**? We're trying to keep it light but practical.

Just an open terrarium for the table where he can climb while we‚Äôre playing dnd or board games or something. He generally does very well with handling and he does like to explore and burrow too. I figure it gives him a small environment to hide in or observe from in a change of scenery if he‚Äôs not wanting to be handled, and maybe will help us do some choice handling training from. 

General idea is like a wooden sandbox with play sand on the bottom with his coconut fibre substrate over that and a little hide on top, with then a couple platforms going up above it for some verticality. Will probably add some fake plants and leaves and stuff too to pretty it up. Unsure on if it makes sense to give a water dish or not too.

My big questions are:

-is this a dumb idea or a good idea health-wise for our kingsnake? 

-Should I treat or not treat the wood a certain way so it‚Äôs nontoxic to him? 


- Dows the wood need to be sanded a special way or anything too? 

-Should I avoid painting the wood at all? 

-Are there glues I should definitely use or avoid, like hot glue gun glue vs gorilla wood glue? 

-Should I have something between the wood and the substrate to make it easier to clean, and if so any ideas on what? 

-Is there another material that would be better than wood? Considering if 3D printing one would be better and safer. 

Any other ideas or feedback is welcome! ",3,1728353862.0,snakes,4,0.81,False

I'm tired of being affected by their problems that they refuse to address. A month ago I was sitting in the kitchen at 2am having some coffee when my dad came out of the bedroom with all of his pistols and proceeded to hide them. He didn't even say anything to me, I had to ask. He then told me that my mom is cheating again and that he's going to file for divorce (third time around). The hiding of the guns was because he was afraid she might try to kill herself..she lost her father to suicide and has made threats before. But I just sat there stone faced as my dad told me everything because it's nothing new. The last time this happened he hid all of the knives because he was afraid she might try to stab him in his sleep. He slept in the garage because of it. Upon being served the first time she told him she hopes he burns to death in a car accident. He backed out of the divorce and then it was as if nothing ever happened. 

Fast forward to now.. for the past several weeks I've watched my parents go from not even looking at each other to cuddling on the couch like nothing  happened. Again. And I'm supposed to go along with it. I'll say one thing that has given me a smidge of respect for them is that they both admitted they never should have gotten married nor had kids and that they're sorry. I appreciated that. Still want nothing to do with them. The other side of the planet isn't far away enough honestly ",6,1728353798.0,areweinhell,2,0.88,False
1fyp80o,https://www.reddit.com/r/rusted_satellite/comments/1fyp80o/opinion_shapeshifting_ufo_spotted_over_bogot√°/,"""Opinion: Shape-shifting UFO spotted over Bogot√°""","[This image of a UFO was captured April 12, 2015 over the city of Bogot√°, Colombia](https://preview.redd.it/i7dzzfk5yftd1.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=86437dea2682cfdc0f48deec03578d6a70c77019)

As the Director and Editor-in-chief of Colombia‚Äôs English language newspaper, The City Paper, I take journalistic ethics very seriously. I also worked as a photojournalist for the Black Star photo agency in New York for over 10 years, covering conflicts in Colombia and Angola, photo essays across Asia and South and Central America.

I have had the honor of having my work published in prestigious publications such as TIME, Der Spiegel, Stern, Marie Claire,¬†*The New York Times*¬†and many others. I do not manipulate my images.

On Sunday, April 12, I stepped out onto my balcony, which faces east and is located in the Rosales neighborhood of Bogot√°. As is a bad habit, I enjoy a morning coffee with a cigarette. It was a grey, Sunday morning, the streets were empty, and washed with a light drizzle from the night, which had passed.

As I looked up and beyond the red walls of my¬†*barrio,*¬†I saw a black round object rise vertically into the sky, from behind a ridge of the¬†*Cerros Orientales*. At a possible distance of 5 kms, the shape was rounded and appeared like a spot against the uniformity of grey, which was blanketing¬†this capital of eight million.

As a frustrated commercial airline pilot, I also know my plane configurations. Up close or from great distances. I know how to distinguish the sound of an Airbus A 340 to a Boeing 777. I have studied flight maps, flight routes and Flightaware. I understand these machines. I admire them. There was no fuselage, no winglets, no sound. This was no plane.

[This image of a UFO was captured over the eastern mountains in Bogota, Colombia. \(Richard Emblin\)](https://preview.redd.it/8hctp52cyftd1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b743b22b4554047ce762b5d544fce414ca87037)

The black dot began to unravel itself. It stopped under the melancholic canopy of cloud and darted south, where it shifted on its side. I abandoned the cigarette for my connected iPhone. It said 7:55 am. I tried to look for the object in the sky. It was¬†hovering West and moving between altitudes, over the Chapinero neighborhood of Bogot√° and which sits at 2,600 meters above sea level.

The spot was not visible on the screen of my iPhone. I tried to look for it again with my eyes, but the black object had shifted in the sky above my building. I thought it might head towards the airport, so I grabbed my Nikon 300s and tried to remember where I keep a 500 mm lens, which I use only when there is a full moon. And not even.

I mounted the lens and went towards my kitchen which faces East, and with an uninspired view of the SENA tower. There it was, and now moving in a bizarre, erratic manner.

I tried to focus (had forgotten this vital skill with a 500 mm, fixed f.8) and pointed my lens towards the other side of Bogot√°. The object was not one, but two it seemed.

As it stopped for a fleeting moment over the Camp√≠n area of town, an Avianca Airbus A320 had just taken off and was doing its mandatory right bank over the Calle 68. The plane was possibly heading to Cali. The pilots of the flight and Air Traffic Control Tower of El Dorado might have seen the object if I could from my kitchen.

It was very evident to me that this was an Unidentified Flying Object ‚Äì UFO. No Drone. No Sunday morning balloon flight over a capital in which only official helicopters (Police and Army) can patrol. No small planes are allowed to cross the Colombian capital, expect with a very special permit handed down from the Aeronautica Civil (Civil Aviation Authority).

All small aircraft must depart from Guaymaral and circumnavigate Bogot√°, allowing space for commercial jets to do their difficult take off procedure from the West to East, and at a high altitude, and with a mountain range facing the airport‚Äôs main, two runways, just 8 kms away.

[The UFO appeared to change shape and color while flying higher in the sky above Bogota. \(Richard Emblin\)](https://preview.redd.it/4lbzq1zhyftd1.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3e80396dbc0676c2df91ebccaf6a485858585a)

My photography skills are rusty. I take few pictures these days:¬†mostly portraits and stills for the pages of my newspaper. I could discern that the object shifted its shape. Could rise and fall quickly, and zip from one end of the city in a matter of seconds.

The rising Airbus as it headed to southern shores seemed heavy and lethargic by comparison. The black dot seemed to have rings. It then tilted, shifted to one side, and disappeared.

I left the kitchen and connected the Compact Flash card to my Mac. I opened Photoshop CS and zoomed in on my UFO. At times, it was black and rounded, then two rings were evident. With a closer look, the rings were golden.

The pictures are as they were captured, with shaky hands and guarded¬†breath. I cropped several of them to examine the shape against the grey sky. Make your own conclusions. I am not here to convince you. That is not my objective. Just that this wet Sunday in Bogot√°, something mysterious was seen over Bogot√° and for which I have no answers.

However, most scents in this arena I've tried lately have really fallen flat. For example, Bianco Latte smelled way too sickly sweet and one note for me.
