------------------------------------------------------------------

Managing stress is essential for maintaining mental and physical well-being. In recent years, adaptogens have gained popularity for their potential to reduce stress and enhance resilience. These natural substances, often found in herbs and plants, help the body adapt to stress by regulating various biological processes. You might be wondering how exactly adaptogens work and which ones you can incorporate into your routine.

Adaptogens are unique because they help stabilize physiological processes and support homeostasis. When you're under stress, your body goes into a ""fight or flight"" mode, which increases cortisol levels. This can lead to fatigue, anxiety, and other health issues. Adaptogens can help lower cortisol levels and improve your overall response to stress.

Some of the most well-known adaptogens include:

- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This herb is known for its ability to enhance mood and improve cognitive function. It helps combat fatigue and provides energy for both body and mind.
- **Ashwagandha:** A powerful adaptogen that not only lowers cortisol levels but also helps reduce anxiety symptoms. It can promote a sense of calm, making it easier to handle stress.
- **Holy Basil:** Also known as Tulsi, Holy Basil has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It supports the adrenal glands and helps balance stress hormones.
- **Eleuthero:** Commonly referred to as Siberian ginseng, Eleuthero can help boost endurance and stamina. It supports the immune system, making you more resilient to stressors.
- **Mac Root:** This root helps balance hormones and boost energy levels, making it a great choice for those dealing with chronic stress.

These adaptogens into your daily routine can be simple. Here are some effective ways to do it:

- **Teas:** Many adaptogens are available in tea form. Sipping on herbal teas can be a calming ritual that helps you unwind after a long day.
- **Supplement Pills:** If you prefer a more straightforward approach, you can find many of these adaptogens in capsule or liquid form.
- **Smoothies:** Add adaptogenic powders to your morning smoothies for an extra health boost. They can blend seamlessly into your favorite recipes.
- **Baking:** Incorporate adaptogen powders like maca or ashwagandha into your baked goods for an added health benefit.

While adaptogens are generally safe, it‚Äôs essential to consult with a healthcare professional before adding them to your routine, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking medications. Different people may respond differently, and finding the right adaptogen for your specific needs can make a significant difference.

Beyond incorporating adaptogens, many lifestyle choices can enhance your resilience against stress. Make sure to prioritize sleep, hydration, and nutrition. Regular physical activity is also vital for managing stress, as it releases endorphins which promote a sense of well-being.

This holistic approach‚Äîcombined with the power of adaptogens‚Äîcan create a robust strategy for managing stress effectively. Remember that resilience is not just about getting through tough times but also about thriving and learning from them.

In your everyday life, being proactive about your stress management will lead you to better emotional health and stability. Start small by introducing one adaptogen at a time and observe how your body responds. This trial-and-error approach can help you understand what works best for you so that you can create a tailored stress management plan.

As we navigate the complexities of modern life, using adaptogens can arm us with the tools needed to face challenges confidently. Embrace these natural helpers and create a stronger, more resilient mindset to manage stress effectively.

If you are on medications or have underlying health conditions, consult with a healthcare provider before adding adaptogens to your routine. They can advise you on the best types and dosages based on your individual health needs.

This is a problem for me since I always make a coffee for me and for my girlfriend in the morning, so wasting a coffee each time or having one that is too bitter/sour is annoying.

Here are the exact steps I use, maybe if you find anything wrong in my method:

Enter: Time Blocking‚Äîa quirky, seemingly old-school strategy that has turned my life upside down (in the best way possible)!

**Here's the scoop:**

* **The Never-Ending To-Do List:**  
Picture Monday morning. Fresh coffee, fresh mindset... but then, boom! An avalanche of tasks. My to-do list was growing faster than my caffeine buzz. I would finish my day with more tasks added than crossed off. Frustrating, right? 

* **Let's Talk Time Blocking:**  
I was skeptical at first. ""You mean, schedule every. Single. Thing? Even Netflix?"" ü§î *Yes*, actually. The trick here isn‚Äôt just scheduling work tasks. It‚Äôs allocating time for everything‚Äîbreaks, meals, walking your dog, or even scrolling through Instagram. The rigid structure can feel like having a helicopter mom... at first. But bear with me!

* **Unexpected Win:**  
After just a week with time blocking, guess what? I ""found"" an extra 10 hours. No magic wands needed! üöÄ Here's how: knowing exactly when I‚Äôd tackle each task cut down on that pesky ""transition time"" where you sit around thinking, ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù

- **Why It Worked So Well for Me:**
  - **Focus Mode:** When it‚Äôs time for Task X, that's it. My brain goes, ""Oh, right! No side quests!"" üß†
  - **Boundaries Galore:** I now know when work stops and play begins. No more emails during dinner!
  - **Freedom in Structure:** It sounds contradictory, but having a plan gave me more flexibility to ""fit in fun"" without feeling guilty.

* **A Little Funny Tale:**  
One day, a friend called¬†at the same time as my 'chill hour.' I told him, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm chilling. Let's chat!‚Äù And he burst out laughing, saying, ""Who *schedules* chilling?!"" But you know what? It was the first time in weeks I actually *chilled* guilt-free.

---

Is time blocking for everyone? Maybe not. But if you're looking at your never-shrinking, anxiety-inducing to-do list and feel like pulling your hair out, why not give it a go? Who knows, you might just ""find"" some extra hours, too. üåà

1jo6pni,https://i.redd.it/3gymzji6t1se1.jpeg,Wonderful Anaerobic Natural Ethiopian from S&W Coffee Roasters this morning.,"I‚Äôve been a V60 guy for filter coffee on my days off for the last couple of years. Wanted to add a no-bypass brew method that would incorporate the ability to steep the coffee to get a different flavor profile to add some variety to my coffees. And so far I‚Äôve been surprised and delighted with the ability of my new Aeropress to easily brew a rich, complex, flavorful cup of coffee with very low bitterness. 

A side benefit is the ability to brew lightly roasted coffees that would ordinarily be considered to need at least 2-3 weeks of rest, very soon after roast, due to the Aeropress‚Äôs ability to brew with a long contact time that negates the effects of a bean that hasn‚Äôt had the chance to fully off-gas. A coffee researcher by the name of Jonathan Gagne has been mentioned as the originator of the long contact time Aeropress brew. 

This morning I decided to try inverted, 1:17 ratio (11.7:200), 195¬∞F (since this is a natural processed bean), 90 clicks out from full fine on X-Pro (about 10 clicks finer than a typical 200ml pourover setting). A few quick back-and-forth stirs with the paddle, 10-minute steep, then a quick, gentle shake before a gentle, 1-minute press. 

The result in the cup from this Ethiopia Worka Sakaro Anaerobic Wine Process Natural was an aromatic fruitiness that wasn‚Äôt overpowering, and a coffee in the cup that was sweet and juicy, with a pleasant acidity, and a jammy aftertaste, and the flavor profile didn‚Äôt deteriorate as it cooled! 

I was a bit concerned about not having rested this long enough, as it‚Äôs only 13 days post-roast. But it was great. IDK if it was the long contact time, but it worked out perfectly. 

If you haven‚Äôt already, go check out u/s&wcoffeeroasters out of Indiana. They put out a great selection of both washed and naturally-processed beans, at a very fair price. ",4,1743436958.0,AeroPress,2,1.0,False

1jo6k23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1jo6k23/my_7yearold_is_being_hospitalized_and_im_terrified/,My 7-year-old is being hospitalized and I'm terrified,"I (29 trans guy, autistic) am currently at home after having to sign my 7-year-old autistic/ADHD/ODD son into a mental health facility for the first time. 

I'm not a big fan of mental health hospitalizations for kids because I had a lot of trauma growing up related to being in the mental health system myself, and unfortunately I'm in a state where there are only five hospitals that are willing to accept children under 13 and one of them is almost 9 hours away. I never wanted to have to send my child to a mental health facility ever if I could have avoided it but I really couldn't this time. 

Back in November my son was burnt with a cigarette lighter by another child on the school bus. My son doesn't understand fear or people being mean to him in the same way that neurotypical children do or some ""higher functioning"" neurodivergent people like myself do, so he still thinks that this bully is his friend and he is not afraid of fire or the pain of being burned again. He just sees it as something interesting that his friend taught him. 

He has had many escalating aggressive and negative behaviors over the past 6 months because of emulating this bully/friend on the school bus and how they behave negatively, especially because this other child does not get consequences for these actions even whenever I have begged the school to take action for my son being burnt and slapped and spit on. My son doesn't understand that these are acts of aggression against him so he just does it back and thinks it's a game.

We don't have any available lighters or anything in our home because of having small children and my son knows that but he also knows that you can burn yourself on things that get hot and we have taught him for years to avoid hot heaters and to never touch the stove or the coffee maker or the toaster or anything like that but recently he has been asking me things like ""the hot oven burn you?"" (""Does the oven get hot enough to burn you?"" in his way of speaking) and I've always reiterated that being burned hurts and it's dangerous and that you never want to play with things like that. 

On Saturday night I was in the bathroom getting ready for work and I heard my toaster pop. I was the only adult in the house, so I immediately came out of the bathroom and went into the kitchen and I saw smoke and a small amount of flames coming out of the toaster which had been popped down again. I immediately unplugged it and basically flung it out my front door, I put out the fire quickly and the outside of the toaster was burning hot. I looked inside and I saw that there had been plastic packaging from snacks like muffins and gushers that had been shoved inside before the toaster had been popped down. I went inside and looked at my son and realized that he had Burns on his knuckles and he said it was from playing with the toaster and setting it on fire. They weren't super severe and he didn't need to go to the hospital, we were able to treat them at home, but my partner came home and explained to him with me that what he did was extremely dangerous and he could have really hurt himself. We gave him a very long safety talk about why you don't play with appliances and how we don't have a toaster anymore and how he's lucky that he just ended up with little Burns and didn't lose a finger but none of it seemed to get through to him. We agreed to call his psychiatrist on Monday morning whenever they were open and just tried to keep an extra eye on him. 

Yesterday morning at about 8:30, my partner is still asleep and I was in the bathroom again and my son started trying to get my attention and whenever I told him that I was going to be in the bathroom for a minute, I heard him in the kitchen and then he started shouting for me. I quickly got out of the bathroom and saw him holding a foam alphabet puzzle piece (like the ones that you put on the floor to make like a floor mat) that was still smoldering and smoking and he told me he set the heater on fire. I ran over to the baseboard heater and saw that he had shoved his sisters winter coat, multiple pieces of laminated paper, multiple foam puzzle pieces and a book inside of the baseboard heater in our kitchen and thankfully the puzzle piece that he had been holding was the only thing that kind of caught on fire. I managed to remove everything else while I was yelling and waking my partner up, and we realized that this was a deliberate fire starting habit that my child was trying to do to seek attention and as a result we had to call crisis to figure out what to do. 

Crisis basically told us that it was unsafe for us to have him in the house with our younger child if he was purposely starting fires the moment that he knew adults were out of the room or unavailable, like whenever someone was taking a while in the bathroom, and that it would be literally impossible for us to have someone watch him one on one 24/7 at home the same way that they couldn't hospital and that at a hospital they would be able to talk with him and try to understand why he's doing this behavior and get him to learn how to stop in some way. 

I sat with him in the emergency room yesterday from about 9:00 in the morning whenever we first got there to 10:30 or 11:00 at night before my partner had to go to work night shift and I had to stay home while our daughter slept. Crisis pretty much immediately determined that he was a danger to himself and others and did not understand the consequences of his actions well enough to even try to develop a safety plan. We had a little bit of a discussion and had a hard time getting them to agree to admit him because of how few hospitals in our state are willing to take children his age. There's one that I really trust because I was there as a minor but they're 9 hours away, though thankfully there's one about an hour away that I also trust immensely that is trying to find a bed for him today. 

It's been really really stressful. Anyone who is sat in the emergency room with a 7 year old and a toddler for over 12 hours could probably understand but the added knowledge that my baby was going to be away from me and all other family for the first time in his life was really upsetting to me. He has gone with his grandparents before for weekends but he has never really been away from home before and I was calling into the emergency room pretty much every hour asking how he was. He didn't sleep last night and just stayed up playing with the toys that I left for him and talking with the nurses and jumping around. Apparently he's also been talking a lot about what he did but he doesn't seem to understand the gravity of it or that it was bad. He more sees starting fires as a game.

I feel like a really horrible parent for not being at the hospital with him 24/7 but I can't make my toddler go through that as well and I don't have childcare or family in the area that could help. All of my family live three or four hours away and none of them could help on this short of notice. I feel absolutely horrible about this whole situation and I just wish I could go back in time and get his school to have taken the other incidents that happened more seriously so that it wouldn't have gotten to this point where he thinks it's okay to play with fire and to hurt people or himself because he doesn't understand it. 

It's terrifying especially because I've been noticing the more he's accidentally hurt himself that he's like me where he has an extremely high pain tolerance and often doesn't even flinch or notice whenever he accidentally cuts or Burns himself while he's acting up. I'm the kind of person who willingly gets large tattoos in one session and very painful piercings without flinching and I've endured multiple painful medical procedures without any anesthetic and without really reacting so I worry that he could turn into someone who doesn't understand or realize how badly he's hurting himself or might do it on purpose just to get a thrill out of it as he gets older, similar to how some teenagers self-injure to relieve stress or to get a high. 

I have all of these thoughts spiraling through my brain and I just don't know what to do. I just want my little boy to be safe and happy. I just remember hugging him and kissing him and trying to tuck him in good night with his Elmo stuffy before I left the hospital and he was in paper scrubs that they made him wear and he had very little idea of what was going on and just told me that he loved me too and gave me a big hug. I wish I could be there with them all the time while he's going through this but I know I can't. All of this is killing me inside. I don't want to see my little one hurt himself but I don't want him away. 

This is all really difficult and I just wish that there were easier ways to prevent things like this and that the system we had worked better. I wish I had other options but starting fires is literally one of those behaviors that you can't just ignore or hope it goes away. I don't want him to hurt himself, or someone else,or burn our house down. I'm just panicking and I'm so scared all around because I do not know what to do other than just hope and pray that the doctors help him and treat him nicely.",0,1743436578.0,Autism_Parenting,1,0.4,False

1jo6bhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/electrical/comments/1jo6bhx/electric_induction_motor_question_lower_amperage/,Electric Induction Motor Question - Lower amperage replacement?,"Hey Folks! 

I have some questions on replacing an electric induction motor on a coffee roaster.  We have a coffee roaster that uses an electric induction motor for the cooling tray, the coffee gets dumped into the cooling tray and the fan kicks on pulling air down through the tray and out. 

We recently started having issues where the fan, after several roast cycles (approx 3-4) will trip the thermal overload relay.  Allow it to cool, 10 ish minutes, can reset it, run another cooling cycle and it trips again.  Let it sit for a few hours, and its good for another 3-4 cycles.  A cycle is approx 5-8min of the fan being on, then its shut up. 

I contacted the maker of the roaster, and they want $3k for a small 1hp motor.  

I have found several similar options, but the only spec it doesn't meet is the amperage. either lower or far too high. 

  
I was curious if it would be ok to put a lower amperage motor on this fan?  

the specs for the motor installed are. 1 hp , 1 ph, 3600 rpm, 5.9/4.8a Nema 56 face mount.  

  
Any help with that would be amazing!

1jo69vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1jo69vn/annoying_behavior_bingo/,Annoying behavior bingo,"A young woman came up to the desk to extend her reservation. It took about twice as long as necessary because she was also having a banal phone conversation that the whole world apparently needed to hear because it's on speaker, and she kept wandering back and forth between the desk and the coffee station.

I didn't have anything else I needed to do, so I just let her do her thing. The only time she was wasting was her own. Once she was done, she headed over to the couch and started a new phone call with someone else. She also decided it was a good time to enjoy a granola bar, loudly, while talking. Her conversation partner did not seem perturbed by this, but I think they must be used to annoying things considering their smoke detector kept beeping periodically.

Then she decided it was time to start singing for some reason. She had neither the skill or the taste to be doing this in public, but belted out a few tone deaf lines of a song I believe is called 7 Years. That song sucks even when sung properly. I joked with a friend that it was like she had a checklist of annoying things to do in public and was checking them off as she went along. Maybe next she'd whip off her shoes and out some nail clippers. 

Around this time an Uber pulled up outside. I glanced at it to see if they were dropping off or picking up, and since they were picking up I didn't need to do anything and forgot they were there for the time being. Simultaneously, the annoying woman haunting the lobby made a third speakerphone call to someone who must be hard of hearing based on the fact that she spoke to them twice as loudly as she'd spoken to the other two, but at least their smoke detector wasn't trying to chime in. 

After a few minutes of this, I hear her say, ""Oh, my Uber is here."" Ma'am, your Uber was here a few minutes ago! You've just been sitting here wasting their time. I did rideshare driving for a spell when I needed some extra money and people who needed you to wait were one of the biggest pet peeves. I get sometimes you're caught off guard but this girl was just not paying attention. Not to mention, she could see the car from where she was hanging out. Idk about you, but if I'm waiting on a ride and a car pulls up near me, I'm going to check to see if that's my ride and not keep sitting there with my thumb up my butt.

And then there were the late check out guys. [One already annoyed me yesterday](https://redd.it/1jnmmmn). Very briefly mentioned in the first paragraph was that he wanted a later check out than we offer, and I told him the latest check out we offer is 12pm. Well this morning he came down asking again if he can check out at 1pm. I apologized and told him that, like I told him yesterday, 12pm is the latest check out we offer. He started to ask again if he could check out at 1pm, but I'd learned yesterday that the only 'no' he'll accept is a blunt dismissal so I interrupted him and politely but firmly said, ""12pm is the absolute latest check out we offer."" He slunk off with his tail between his legs.

The next one the night auditor warned me about. Overnight he'd called and asked for a 12:30 c/o. The night auditor explained that the latest check out we offer is 12, but the guy kept pressing. Finally the auditor told him to call when I came in and ask me, but told him that an exception was unlikely.

The guy was not only undeterred, he decided he was going to press his luck even harder because when he called he asked for a 1pm check out, not 12:30. I apologized and said that we don't offer checkouts after 12. He kept pressing, saying he'd been here for a week and had a meeting at 2:30, couldn't he stay until 1pm? Again I told him that 12pm was the latest late check out we offer, but I could see if I could do a reduced rate for him for the night and he could check out when convenient.

This wasn't good enough, he said again that he'd been here for a week and we couldn't extend him the courtesy of a late check out? I said he was getting a late check out at 12pm, the absolute latest we offer, and was there anything else I could do for him? So he asked for a manager. Now I'm not a manager, but I am allowed to pretend in situations such as these which is much better than actually being a manager IMO. I told him I was the manager on duty. Wouldn't you know it, the reason he was asking for a manager was because he thought it would somehow get him a later check out. It did not.

Again he whined about how he'd been here for a week and he had a meeting at 2:30. I suggested the nearby the library or Starbucks as places he could kill some time until then. He made one feeble attempt at negotiating for 12:30, and I thought it would be funny to troll him and counter with 11:30 but didn't. Instead I told him he was down for check out at 12 o'clock noon, was there anything else I could do for him? There was not, but let's see if he actually gets out at 12.",4,1743435864.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False
1jo694f,https://i.redd.it/8sy7ea6lo1se1.png,Happy World Backup Day 2025!,"## In honor of World Backup Day ‚Äì March 31

March 31 is World Backup Day a global reminder that your data isn't immortal, your hard drive will eventually die, and ‚ÄúI thought I saved it‚Äù isn't a recovery strategy.

And no your photos aren‚Äôt actually backed up on iCloud; they're just synced. Google and Microsoft don‚Äôt truly back up your emails; that's your responsibility. Slack can and will lose your precious conversations, and yes, even your fancy S3 buckets can vanish because a cloud admin clicked the wrong button (trust me, it happens more often than you'd like). Remember, the Cloud is just someone else's computer managed by someone who hasn't had their coffee yet.

So today, let‚Äôs raise a toast to the unsung hero of the digital world: the quiet one, the awkward one the one that never gets a thank you unless something crashes. And if you don‚Äôt have a backup to toast with, spare a thought for those colleagues you really don‚Äôt want to organize a farewell party for after the next ransomware attack or the inevitable human error (even though you enabled versioning on S3).

Let's explore how backups evolved from panic-driven memory dumps to intelligent, queryable snapshots and perhaps you'll finally see backups as your new best friend, not just a grudging necessity.

## The 1950s to 1970s: Brute-force survival

Welcome to the era of mainframes, magnetic tapes, and IBM engineers who backed up data as if it was a military drill because it practically was.

No folders, no files, no undo buttons. Backup meant dumping every single bit of memory or disk onto tapes using tools like `dd`, `tar`, or `cpio`. There was no ""restore document"" option your recovery plan was reloading everything, slowly, manually, and with all the grace of a brick falling from the sky.

It wasn't elegant, but it worked. Mostly.

Think of it as photocopying your entire house just to preserve the bathroom.

## The 1980s and 1990s: Archives you could carry

Then came personal computers and the sweet agony of limited floppy disk space (remember those 1.44MB disks?). Compression became essential, giving us ZIP, RAR, and ARJ. Suddenly backups weren't just about survival; they were portable.

People didn't just back up they zipped, emailed, shared, hid, and labeled archives as ""homework_final_FINAL.zip."" But restoration? Let's be honest it wasn‚Äôt a priority. The internet was still dial-up and barely critical, so who cared if restoration was fragile? Your backups fit in your backpack, and that was cool enough.

Backups felt personal. Restoring? Meh, tomorrow‚Äôs problem. Honestly, we spent more time choosing funny filenames than worrying if we could ever open them again.

## Late 1990s to mid-2000s: Incrementals, deduplication, and system clones

As IT expanded, backups matured rapidly. Incremental backups emerged, making nightly backups manageable without drowning in tapes. Hardware deduplication dramatically reduced storage costs, with Data Domain appliances becoming overnight stars, giving IT managers new hope.

Simultaneously, system cloning revolutionized disaster recovery. Tools like Norton Ghost, Acronis True Image, and Apple's Time Machine enabled quick, bootable restorations. Time Machine even made backups stylish, letting users flip through past states as if browsing Netflix. Finally, backups had better user interfaces than most corporate websites at the time.

Yet, these backups were still tied closely to their environments you couldn't peek inside without restoring first.

## 2005 to today: Smarter, safer, and open (thanks, ransomware!)

Because nothing says ‚ÄòHappy Monday‚Äô like an encrypted hard drive and a Bitcoin ransom note.

Enter the open-source backup revolution: Borg, Restic, Duplicity, Tarsnap and Kopia stepped onto the scene. Incremental snapshots became standard, finally burying full backups. Deduplication and encryption weren't optional they became essential, driven largely by escalating ransomware threats.

Legacy backup solutions scrambled to add encryption at rest and in transit, but bolting on security didn't overcome fundamentally outdated designs. Automation, DevOps pipelines, and cloud environments demanded backups be non-intrusive, frequent, and recoverable at a granular level.

Backups finally became proactive, strategic, and ransomware-resistant. Yet, most still required a full restore to reveal their contents. They remained boxed-up archives rather than usable data assets.

Until now.

## The 2025 and beyond: Enter the Kloset

Today‚Äôs data isn‚Äôt neatly packaged in simple files anymore. It's databases, cloud objects, SaaS platforms scattered across hybrid, edge, and distributed infrastructures. You don't just need to store this data; you need to audit, query, reuse, and restore it seamlessly across entirely different environments, something legacy file system based backup approaches simply aren't built for.

Enter Kloset, the groundbreaking backup engine powering Plakar. Kloset encapsulates each snapshot into a self-contained, immutable, structured data asset. Like a container that packages an app with everything it needs, Kloset packages data with context, structure, metadata, and integrity. You can inspect and query snapshots without restoration, conduct forensic searches, compliance audits, or integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines.

Effortlessly transition between different environments from databases to filesystems, S3 buckets to local disks, edge to cloud. Kloset transforms backups from mere archives into actionable, portable data assets, designed explicitly for reuse rather than recovery alone.

And yes, it's proudly open source.

## Final thoughts: What have we learned this World Backup Day?

Backup isn‚Äôt about files anymore it‚Äôs about managing complex data streams flowing from countless applications, SaaS services, and distributed infrastructures. Your backups must match the complexity and flexibility of modern data ecosystems.

It‚Äôs time to stop seeing backups as chores or emergency-only solutions. Embrace them. Unlock their potential.

This World Backup Day, take a moment to ensure you have at least one regular backup of all your critical data, no matter what backup technology you're using that‚Äôs already a great start. If you really want to sleep well at night, keep regular copies in at least three different locations, media, or providers, with at least one offline (Deep Archive or magnetic tapes are your friends).

I have a sneaking suspicion one of my dogs can't see anything far away and it affects her life.  I did a bit of googling but was hoping for any real life advice anyone has.  

 I've had my pups for around 6 months. They are lab mixes (chocolate and golden) the vet said they were just under or around one when I got them from the shelter.  

One is very scared of the dark. Like refuses to go outside to go to the bathroom at night. She also will sit next to our bed and watch the window until sunrise and then wake us up to take her out.  We know because both of us have woken at different times and observed her doing this.  If she insists on going outside at night and anything other than a completely still night like the the wind will blow the trees has her bolting for the front door.  One time  A bag was caught on a tree around dusk, she was like 15 feet away when she say it and she refused to go outside for hours even after we showed it to her that we removed it.  

They come to the office with me everyday but Recently she started freaking out when people she didn't know were in the next room and sometimes ones she does know.  My husband and I were going to sit out back and have coffee.  He set the girls up and the chairs - I was bringing the coffee.  She started scary barking at me until I got closer and then she instantly was like ""oh look it's mom.  Sorry!"" And cuddled with me /gave me lots of lickies.

I‚Äôve taken on all the kid and house duties, I pick or buy flowers, I try and listen to the things she said were road blocks. She mentions even wanting a new kind of coffee creamer or anything I make a mental note and get it. I try all the love languages we seem to be in a really good place and get along so well. 

She wants to feel pretty but not from me. I can say all day how I think and feel about it but zero affect. A friend says something it lights her up, me it‚Äôs almost annoying it seems like or she just doesn‚Äôt believe me. 

We‚Äôve been to therapy, we‚Äôve talked and talked and she can say the right things but then it‚Äôs immediately right back to nothing. 

She might get in the mood 2-3 days after her period but then it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs me that she wants it‚Äôs anything from anyone. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I need to be there at all. 

Not getting divorced, I‚Äôve been once it doesnt fix or help at all. 

I feel as if I‚Äôm not ugly but cute enough that if I‚Äôm the guy you give a chance after some other guy who was an asshole it‚Äôs like oh shit he treats me right and doesn‚Äôt hit me or say awful things to me so let‚Äôs try it but that dies out because there never was a real physical attraction to me, I was just the nice guy who wasn‚Äôt too ugly to be seen with. 

She can get horny, she finds men attractive. She just can‚Äôt get horny or desire for me. If her body says it‚Äôs been a long time just get you some then she can force herself to let me be that person. 

We aren‚Äôt sexless per se but we are passionless, desireless, and at time downright mean with conversations she has with friends that are obviously more important than me. You‚Äôd think we have wild sex often with how she speaks around people, the music she will put on.

We like to entertain, host parties but it‚Äôs gotten painful for me. Watching her have a few drinks and then turn into this other person where she talks like a person who would like sex and will be all about some celebrity or singer. Come end of the party she‚Äôs been talking sexually making jokes even at times flirting with me but the second everyone leaves it right to sleep and I‚Äôve been teased for hours and I‚Äôm the asshole if I want to have sex. 

She apologies, knows it‚Äôs an issue but therapy has done nothing, she use to go and she says she‚Äôs much better and she is in so many other areas and with her other relationships but it feels like as the lowest priority I‚Äôm just a problem that won‚Äôt ever get any effort. 

All that to say, I‚Äôm not leaving, I want advice on replacing the need to be wanted and desired and feel attractive, feel like a man. What helps? What can I do to be ok without that need being met. 

I am not ignorant to things and life happen, was I always a great partner, no. Did I ever cheat or hit or verbally abuse, no. I got to wrapped in work and with kids from a previous marriage I had baggage. 

I‚Äôve tried to work on everything I can. Do what all the experts and therapist say. There‚Äôs nothing I can do to be wanted, or desired. I have to body type options skinny or fat. Years in the gym only got me thin, no amount of protien and weights put big muscle on. Testosterone to get jacked is only going to make me hornier so that‚Äôs not an option. 

If she is ever honest and just tells me it‚Äôs me and I‚Äôm just not attractive I think she thinks I‚Äôd leave. I wouldn‚Äôt. Would I sleep in a different room and we become officially married roommates, 100%. I‚Äôm just waiting for that day so I can get out of the bedroom and now I‚Äôm not the asshole for being the one who stops pursuing, stops any effort to make her feel pretty. 

Meanwhile I feel like a fucking river troll and the embarrassment that comes with letting myself try and get rejected is killing me. I get it, I‚Äôm not doing it for you at all you want me to take care of everything and make your life easier but this seems cruel to tease me and then if I get a little down about it now I‚Äôm an asshole and making her feel bad. I can‚Äôt even have emotions or feelings about it. I need to just act like I‚Äôm 100% happy or I‚Äôm the worst and make her life so hard, and her feel so bad.

Someone who loved me wholeheartedly. We shared a bond so deep that when he died, I cried every day for a week. It was my dad.

Having nobody to talk to, I turned to Discord. One night, while in a music VC, someone randomly joined and played some amazing songs. I messaged them, saying they had good taste and that I enjoyed everything they played.

I thought that it was a dude but it turned out to be a girl.

From there she shared her indie playlist. It was new to me‚Äîat first, I found it dull, but over time, it grew on me. (These songs now remind me of the time when I had her in my life as a friend I could share anything with). We started texting, and she told me how hard her life was at coaching in another city. In return, I shared my struggles‚Äîhow I had failed career-wise and the pain of losing my father.

Texting her made me feel relieved. Every day, I waited for her messages, for the first time in my life I got butterflies in my stomachüò≠. Maybe I was just another random guy she talked to, but for me, she was special. She was the first person I had opened up to about my life and everything that bothered me. I was too shy, reserved, and introverted to talk to anyone but somehow, I always felt at ease when talking with her.

I remember one day, it was 11 at night, and I was panicking. I felt tense and worried so I texted her and for the first time, she asked me to call her and explain what had happened. I listened to her voice (her voice has faded from my memories but it was sweet), but I was panicking too much to speak properly. I never called her again after that. I wanted to watch movies with her on Discord but never had the courage to share the link. I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to let her realize that I had started liking her and wanted to be more than friends.

Every day, we talked, but maybe she realized I was good for nothing. I was becoming too complacent in life, and something was constantly bothering me, draining all my motivation. Eventually, she started avoiding me. I didn‚Äôt mind her late replies‚ÄîI assumed she was busy with tests. Then, she completely stopped responding on Discord, but before leaving, she shared her Instagram with me and deleted Discord. We talked a bit there, but soon, she deleted Instagram too. Before vanishing, she gave me her number, and we chatted briefly on WhatsApp‚Äîuntil she ghosted me for good. To this day, I don‚Äôt know why. I remember her last message: ""I have a test, and I am feeling nervous."" She never spoke to me again, and I don‚Äôt know what happened after that.

I remember, one day she had posted a story on her Instagram about some boys in the building across from her, probably teasing or harassing girls. Seeing that, I felt an urge to go there and beat the shit out of them. I genuinely started caring for her. Every now and then, news would come that some girl (from the same city, famous for its coaching institutes) took her own life due to study pressure, and I always prayed it wasn‚Äôt her. Seeing these things always shattered my soul, and I prayed for her well-being.

I always encouraged her when she felt low. I wished to visit her city and ask her out for coffee, just to see her once in person. But I was underconfident about my looks. I knew that if she saw me in real life, she would reject me immediately, so I never asked.

I typed the message, ""Would you like to have a coffee with me?"" several times but never had the courage to press send.

Because of my complacency, she abandoned me. I cried. I felt heavy. I couldn‚Äôt process it. Eventually, I gathered the courage to delete all our old conversations‚Äîone by one‚Äîfrom Discord, Instagram, and WhatsApp. There weren‚Äôt many, just around 500 messages, which isn‚Äôt much for people who talked for 10 months. But for me, each message carried emotions I had never felt before. Finally, after three years of being ghosted, I deleted her number. Seeing her DP for the last time felt heavy.

She once told me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Poornima, look at the moon‚Äîit‚Äôll be at its brightest.‚Äù Like an idiot, I ran to the terrace, stared at the moon, and smiled, thinking about her.

I listened to that one bhajan she sent me. I listened to Anuv Jain and Prateek Kuhad. I don‚Äôt do that now. I am happy with my Punjabi songs. I don‚Äôt look at the moon on Poornima, nor do I have the courage to approach a girl‚Äîonly to be abandoned again.

After her, three more people abandoned me...

Her, her, and her‚Äîall of them had different places in my life. One was my friend, another my crush, another like a sister. But all of them left me for good.

I am not worth being friends with. I don‚Äôt provide value to people. I am useless, and I don‚Äôt deserve anyone. 

Now that everyone has abandoned me, I've deleted all their chats and their numbers, my bp has dropped and I'm feeling lightheaded since I did this. I feel dizzy and I wanna sleep all day.

I have decided that I will never make new friends until I am physically fit (5'5"", 68 kgs rn, I was 114kg, got sick and lost weight in 2024) and achieve all my other long-term goals. 

I was üÖ±Ô∏èuicidal for the longest time, (not because of her but because of something that has been bothering me since 2016 and still is), but now I‚Äôm not, I'll make my life's mission to find a solution for that problem and I WILL FIX IT. I will try to become worthy of good things in life from now on. And i will try to make new friends, and get out of my comfort zone this year onwards. ",3,1743435345.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False

The Science Behind Adaptogens: How They Boost Your Well-Being
-------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, adaptogens have gained popularity for their ability to help the body adapt to stress and promote overall well-being. These natural substances, often derived from herbs and plants, are believed to balance hormones and enhance the body's resilience to physical and mental challenges. Let‚Äôs explore how adaptogens work and the science behind their benefits.

### What Are Adaptogens?

Adaptogens are non-toxic plants that boost the body's ability to cope with stress. They help stabilize physiological processes, improve the body‚Äôs response to stressors, and enhance the overall functioning of the endocrine system, which plays a significant role in hormone regulation.

### How Adaptogens Work

Adaptogens function by modulating the stress response system, primarily through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This system is responsible for the body's response to stress and influences hormone production. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their mechanism:

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
- **Regulating Cortisol Levels:** Adaptogens help to balance cortisol, the primary stress hormone. High levels of cortisol can lead to fatigue, anxiety, and a weakened immune system.
- **Enhancing Energy and Vitality:** By nourishing your adrenal system, adaptogens increase your energy levels and overall stamina without the crash often associated with caffeine and sugar.
- **Boosting Mood:** Some adaptogens, like Rhodiola Rosea, are known to lift mood and reduce symptoms of depression, helping to improve emotional resilience.
- **Supporting Immune Function:** Ingredients like Ashwagandha can enhance immune response, helping your body repel illnesses and maintain balance.

### Popular Adaptogens and Their Benefits

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for its calming effects, it helps reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.
- **Holy Basil:** Also known as Tulsi, it is celebrated for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to combat stress.

When we went: March 2025 ‚Äì early spring

Who went: Quick local staycation with kids ‚Äî I‚Äôm a travel advisor and wanted to see what clients experience first-hand, so I paid full price and booked through my own preferred partner benefits.

‚∏ª

Service: 9/10
Service was polished and warm across the board. The staff was attentive without being overbearing and genuinely welcoming to kids. We were greeted by name multiple times throughout the stay, and the Ritz Kids welcome was a sweet touch‚Äîlittle details like coloring books and kids‚Äô robes make a big difference. My kids felt special from the moment we arrived, and that‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt put a price on.

Also worth noting‚ÄîPortland often gets a bad rap for its downtown homelessness situation, but the door management at the Ritz was excellent. We felt completely safe and comfortable throughout our stay. The hotel handled it with quiet professionalism and made sure the experience inside the building was serene and secure.

‚∏ª

Property: 9/10
The hotel is absolutely stunning‚ÄîPNW-luxe vibes with warm wood, natural textures, and subtle nods to Oregon throughout. It feels elevated yet grounded. The lobby and bar area are chic but still feel approachable.

The 19th-floor spa and infinity pool are gorgeous, with sweeping views of Mount Hood and the city skyline. (Heads up: the spa is open Wednesday‚ÄìSunday in winter, and daily in summer.)

Another major win: Flock Food Hall downstairs. It‚Äôs modern, delicious, and gives you access to a range of local vendors‚Äîperfect for families or those wanting casual variety without leaving the property.

The Club Lounge is also a fantastic feature, with tons of high-quality food options throughout the day and a variety of comfortable seating areas. If you‚Äôre coming to Portland for work, this would be an excellent place to spend the day working remotely. Fast Wi-Fi, solid snacks, and a calm, luxe atmosphere.

Location is great‚Äîwalkable to Powell‚Äôs, the waterfront, museums, and tons of downtown shopping and dining.

‚∏ª

Rooms: 8/10
We stayed in a Grand Deluxe double queen (approx. $450/night). The room was spacious by city standards, with plush beds, thoughtful lighting, and a great layout. Everything felt new and beautifully designed. The bathroom was a highlight, with a deep soaking tub and rainfall shower. I also loved that the seating area could be closed off by a curtain which if you‚Äôre traveling with a small child you can set up their crib behind it and hide from them (so they don‚Äôt get FOMO at bedtime ü§£)

There was in-room coffee (yay!), generous closet space, and a very comfortable desk setup. Views everywhere in the building seemed amazing.

‚∏ª

Food: 8/10
Bellpine is the hotel‚Äôs signature restaurant‚Äîvery Oregon-forward with beautifully presented seasonal dishes. We also enjoyed the bar/lounge area for a casual dinner. Room service was quick and well-executed.

Flock Food Hall downstairs is a huge plus‚Äîgreat variety, modern local vendors, and excellent food without needing to leave the building.

The Club Lounge (if you‚Äôre on a club level or can add access) offers plenty of great food throughout the day, and it‚Äôs a really nice place to hang out or work.

‚∏ª

Extras & activities: 7/10
The indoor infinity pool with city and mountain views is stunning‚Äîelegant but also family-friendly. Spa and fitness center are beautifully designed and spacious. Spa services weren‚Äôt available during our stay (winter weekday), but the space itself was lovely and will be high on my list next time.

Most of our neighbors are aging Boomers‚Äîformer hippies‚Äîand the neighborhood has a tight-knit, almost communal vibe. People help each other out, check in on each other, and generally keep tabs on what's going on. It‚Äôs a lovely place to live, but sometimes the downside is that people can be a little *too* involved, gossipy, and persnickety.

Behind our property, there‚Äôs a lot with several garages that neighbors rent out to store things. Recently, people have been clearing out the garages and organizing old scrap wood, doors, and other community event supplies. This morning, while my husband and I were having coffee in the kitchen, we heard some clanging and looked out the window to see someone literally *throwing* two big wooden panels with hinges attached over our fence‚Äîinto our yard. We also noticed about six heavy wooden doors leaning against our fence, which we just had replaced last summer.

I was immediately annoyed, so I went outside and angrily tossed the panels back over the fence without saying a word. Just as I was finishing, I heard a woman on the other side say, ‚ÄúOop‚Äîoh no‚Äîdon‚Äôt! Those panels are for Jenny. Is this Jenny‚Äôs yard?‚Äù

I told her, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not. Jenny lives next door. And by the way, we don‚Äôt want those doors leaning against our fence‚Äîwe just had it replaced.‚Äù

She started to push back, like she *had* to put them there because there was no other option, but she caught herself, sighed, and dropped it. I didn‚Äôt raise my voice, but I was clearly frustrated.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm second-guessing myself: This neighborhood is so tight-knit that word travels fast, and now I‚Äôm feeling a bit sheepish about how I handled the situation. Once I realized she wasn‚Äôt just dumping trash in our yard and had made a mistake, I felt like an asshole. I could have easily peeked over the fence and said, ‚ÄúExcuse me, what‚Äôs this wood doing in our yard?‚Äù Instead, I just reacted and threw it back in frustration without giving her a chance to explain.

On the flip side, I still think she should have asked us‚Äîor at least had Jenny give us a heads-up‚Äîbefore tossing stuff over the fence or propping heavy doors against something on our property.

So‚Ä¶ AITA?

**TL;DR:** Neighbor mistakenly threw wooden panels into our yard and leaned heavy doors against our new fence without asking. I got frustrated and tossed the panels back without talking to her first. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I overreacted or if she should‚Äôve given us a heads-up. AITA?

Explore the cutting-edge AI algorithm designed to improve intravenous feeding for premature babies, promising safer and more effective care. #AIinHealthcare #PreemieSupport #InfantHealth #MedicalResearch #DeepLearning

Welcome to AI Unraveled. Today, we're venturing into a place where cutting-edge technology meets the most fragile of human lives: the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, or NICU. We'll be exploring a groundbreaking development where Artificial Intelligence is being harnessed for good, specifically aiming to improve the critical nutritional care of premature babies.Imagine a baby born weeks, sometimes months, too early. Their tiny bodies are fighting incredible odds. Organs aren't fully developed, immune systems are fragile, and something as fundamental as feeding becomes a complex medical challenge. Many preemies cannot feed normally; their digestive systems are too immature. For these infants, life often depends on receiving nutrition intravenously ‚Äì a method called Total Parenteral Nutrition, or TPN.

TPN is a lifeline, delivering a precise cocktail of fluids, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, lipids, vitamins, and minerals directly into the bloodstream. But crafting this cocktail is incredibly complex. Every single day, for every single baby, a dedicated team ‚Äì neonatologists, dieticians, pharmacists, nurses ‚Äì collaborates to calculate the exact nutritional formula needed based on the baby's weight, blood tests, and overall condition.

It's a high-stakes balancing act. Too much or too little of any single nutrient can have serious consequences for these vulnerable infants. And herein lies a significant challenge. Dr. Nima Aghaeepour, a professor at Stanford Medicine and senior author of a compelling new study, highlights a stark reality. He states, ""Total parenteral nutrition is the single largest source of medical error in neonatal intensive care units, both in the United States and globally."" Think about that ‚Äì the very process designed to sustain life is also the most error-prone. These aren't necessarily errors of competence, but often arise from the sheer complexity, the constant calculations, transcriptions, and potential for miscommunication in a high-pressure environment.

This is where Artificial Intelligence enters the picture. Researchers at Stanford Medicine asked: could AI help reduce these errors and standardize this complex process, potentially making top-tier nutritional care more accessible?

They developed a specific type of AI called a deep learning algorithm ‚Äì think of it as a sophisticated pattern-recognition system. They trained this AI on a massive dataset: nearly 80,000 intravenous prescriptions previously given to premature babies, crucially including information about the¬†*results*¬†of those prescriptions ‚Äì what worked, what didn't, and the associated patient outcomes.

The AI learned to connect the dots. It learned how different factors in a baby's electronic health record ‚Äì their weight, lab results, gestational age, clinical condition ‚Äì correlated with specific nutritional needs and responses to different TPN formulas.

So, what does this AI actually¬†*do*? Instead of creating a unique, handcrafted formula from scratch every single day for every single baby, the researchers used their AI to identify patterns and develop 15¬†*standardized*¬†TPN formulas. These formulas represent optimized nutritional profiles derived from the vast dataset.

The system works like this: The AI analyzes the specific, current data from an individual preemie's electronic health record. Based on the patterns it learned during training, it then recommends one of those 15 standard formulas and suggests the appropriate duration for its use.

The goal isn't to replace the medical team, but to provide them with a powerful, data-driven decision support tool. It takes the immense complexity of calculation and the risk of manual error largely out of the equation for routine adjustments, freeing up clinicians to focus on the most critical aspects of care and complex cases.

Does it work? Well, the initial results are promising. The Stanford team conducted a test. They presented 10 experienced neonatologists with clinical information for hypothetical premature babies. These doctors were then shown multiple potential TPN prescriptions for these cases ‚Äì some were the actual prescriptions that had been given in real life, and others were prescriptions generated by the AI system.

The outcome was striking: the study reported that the neonatologists ""consistently preferred the AI-generated prescriptions to the real prescriptions."" This suggests the AI wasn't just producing¬†*acceptable*¬†formulas, but potentially¬†*better*, more optimized ones, likely reflecting the collective 'wisdom' embedded within the 80,000 data points it learned from.

# Why does this matter so much? Let's break down the potential impact.

* **Reducing Medical Errors:**¬†This is the most significant potential benefit. By standardizing formulas based on vast data and automating the recommendation process, the AI could dramatically reduce the calculation, transcription, and mixing errors associated with manual TPN preparation. This directly translates to safer care for preemies.
* **Improving Consistency and Quality:**¬†The AI ensures that nutritional decisions are based on objective data analysis and best practices derived from thousands of previous cases, leading to more consistent and potentially higher-quality care, regardless of which clinician is on duty.
* **Increasing Efficiency:**¬†Automating the routine aspects of TPN prescription frees up valuable time for highly skilled NICU staff ‚Äì doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dieticians ‚Äì allowing them to focus on more complex patient needs, direct care, and critical thinking.
* **Enhancing Accessibility:**¬†Perhaps one of the most exciting long-term prospects is improved care in resource-limited settings. NICUs in less developed regions may lack the full team of specialists or the extensive experience found in major academic centers. An AI system like this could encapsulate best practices and provide expert-level nutritional recommendations, helping to level the playing field and make high-quality care more accessible globally. As one researcher involved put it, the goal is to ""make doctors better and make top-notch care more accessible.""

¬†

Now, it's crucial to maintain perspective. This AI system is still in the research phase. It hasn't been implemented in hospitals yet. The next critical step, as the researchers acknowledge, is to conduct rigorous clinical trials. These trials will be essential to definitively prove the system's safety, efficacy, and real-world benefits compared to current standard practices.

We also need to consider the broader implications of AI in such a sensitive area. Ensuring data privacy for patients is paramount. We need transparency in how the AI makes its recommendations. And we must be vigilant about potential biases in the training data that could inadvertently affect certain patient groups. Accountability is another key question ‚Äì if an AI recommendation leads to an adverse outcome, where does responsibility lie? These are complex ethical and practical challenges that need careful consideration as such technologies develop.

But the potential upside is immense. This isn't about replacing the vital human touch and clinical judgment in the NICU. It's about augmenting human capabilities with the power of data analysis. It's about providing clinicians with better tools to manage an incredibly complex task, reducing the burden of potential error, and ultimately, improving outcomes for some of the world's most vulnerable patients.

The Stanford study represents a significant step forward in the field of ""AI for Good."" It demonstrates how artificial intelligence, often discussed in the context of automation or entertainment, can be applied to solve critical problems in healthcare. By learning from vast amounts of past experience, this AI offers the potential to make intravenous feeding for premature babies safer, more consistent, and more effective.

While clinical trials are still needed, this research paints a hopeful picture of a future where technology helps us provide even better care for tiny patients fighting for their lives. It's a reminder that innovation, when guided by compassion and a focus on human well-being, can lead to truly remarkable advancements.

1jo5wfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1jo5wfm/my_almostsixyearold_german_shepherd_doesnt_stop/,My almost-six-year-old German Shepherd doesn‚Äôt stop whining for attention with me but doesn‚Äôt do it with his human Dad (my bf lol),"I loveeee how much my dog loves me. He‚Äôs absolutely a joy and the best companion a girl can have. 

However, that being said, when it‚Äôs just him and I in the house (which is super often as I WFH full time and my BF goes out to work) he won‚Äôt stop whining at me.

I‚Äôll take him on a long, off leash walk in the woods (about 15-30 minutes where he‚Äôll poop and pee) and do that at least three times a day, so he gets plenty of exercise. I also will let him out and if time allows, I‚Äôll play soccer in the backyard with him for a few minutes to tire him out. He eats his kibble and gets a treat when he finishes (usually a dental treat) has plenty of toys and plenty of fresh water. 

He has everything he needs (and tbh probably more than he needs) but he still won‚Äôt stop whining at me for more. And it‚Äôs relentless, high pitched, consistent, constant whining. And nothing I do for him pleases him or stops him. And it‚Äôs making me go crazy.

When he does quiet down, if I move in my chair the slightest amount, if I breathe a little louder, or if I take a drink of my water, he gets up and starts whining at me again. I find myself trying to like, minimize myself so I don‚Äôt rile him up again! And it‚Äôs no way to live!!!

The vet told me it‚Äôs my fault for being home all the time and to go into a separate room without him and close the door to give some space from us, but guess what?! He doesn‚Äôt stop whining or barking and then is like extra anxious. 

So anyways I‚Äôm at my wits end especially after the vet said what she said and that my BF tells me to ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùjust ignore it‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù but I CANT!! Like it‚Äôs so high pitched and hurts my ears!!

I‚Äôve tried to work from my car, from a coffee shop, etc. throughout the day but when I do come back he starts up again. I‚Äôm actually going insane lol

What the hellllll am I supposed to do?! He doesn‚Äôt do this to the same degree with my bf is home, and when I‚Äôm gone for the weekend, he is totally chill and fine with him and doesn‚Äôt make a peep.

1jo5qha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jo5qha,Lotte Palace NYC - Review,"Where we went: New York City ‚Äì Lotte New York Palace

When we went: March 2025 ‚Äì early spring (still chilly, but sunny)

Who went: Family trip ‚Äì I traveled with my kids for their first-ever visit to NYC. I‚Äôm also a travel advisor and booked this stay at full price so I could experience it exactly as my clients would.

‚∏ª

Service: 9/10
The service was one of the highlights. Everyone we encountered was incredibly kind, professional, and warm. My kids were given sparkly crowns at check-in, which was such a fun and thoughtful welcome. Our room service waiter even told us great NYC stories‚Äîreally went above and beyond to make our stay feel special. Service throughout the hotel felt genuine and gracious without being stuffy.

‚∏ª

Property: 8/10
The property is a NYC icon and you feel it‚Äîespecially in the public spaces that nod to the history of the Villard Mansion. The location is fantastic‚Äîcentrally located and within walking distance of so many major attractions. The lobby is elegant and calm, and the overall vibe is sophisticated but still welcoming to families. While not overflowing with on-site amenities or buzz, the property felt like a calm oasis in the city.

‚∏ª

Rooms: 7/10
We stayed in a Cathedral View room (approx. $900/night). The size was excellent for Manhattan‚Äîplenty of space for a family of four, and the view of St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral was gorgeous. The layout was comfortable and functional, and we loved having a proper entry area and generous closet space.

That said, the room did feel a little tired‚Äîsome furnishings could use a refresh, and there was only one USB outlet and no in-room coffee (a small gripe but noticeable on early mornings). The bathroom had lots of towels and a nice soaking tub for kids, but again, some areas felt slightly worn.

‚∏ª

Food: 7/10
The food was very good‚Äîroom service breakfast was a hit, and the breakfast menu at Villard is extensive. However, heads-up: make a reservation for breakfast! We didn‚Äôt the first morning and had to wait about 20 minutes, which was rough with young kids.

For quicker options, Pomme Palais is a solid choice for pastries and coffee, though it closes fairly early. Would‚Äôve loved a little more variety in on-site dining for a longer stay.

‚∏ª

Extras & activities: 6/10
There aren‚Äôt a ton of on-site extras or organized activities, but that‚Äôs typical for a city hotel. The welcome amenity plate for the kids was very thoughtful and appreciated.

If you‚Äôre looking for a central base to explore the city, it‚Äôs perfect. We walked to Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park, and the Theater District easily. Tons to do nearby even if the hotel itself is more about elegance and comfort than activities.

We didn‚Äôt do it but there‚Äôs a weekly tour of the hotel, and I heard from some staff that if you ask nicely they will also show you some of the filming spots for Gossip Girl, which the hotel was used as the home for one of the main characters.",1,1743434489.0,JetSetNest,0,1.0,False
1jo5q3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jo5q3l/aio_for_being_annoyed_at_my_bf_for_being/,AIO for being annoyed at my bf for being reluctant to pay my mom?,"I may have worded the title strangely, so let me explain. For context, my (21F) boyfriend(21M) and I have been dating for about two and a half years. He has a LOT of money saved up from side hustles from highschool. About a year ago, his living situation changed and he couldn‚Äôt live at home anymore (this wasn‚Äôt his fault, just circumstances). He went to live with his long-time best friend, who ended up doing him extremely dirty so he had to move out again. My mom said it would be okay if he stayed with us for a while, so he did. My father passed away from cancer a few years ago, but my mom is a nurse and makes okay enough money to support the family and still have a bit leftover, so she didn‚Äôt mind. She is very sweet woman and a strong believer that if you are able to help someone in need, you should do it. I helped him find and apartment, and my mom co-signed on the lease for him. She did not charge him rent for the time he stayed at our house or for anything else. Flash forward to right before Christmas, we get the news that my mom has breast cancer. We were lucky and the doctors caught it early, but she would have to undergo about six months of chemotherapy, during which she could only work occasionally because of the effects of chemo. I decided to take a semester off from school (nursing pre-reqs) to work and help bring money home, but my mom refused and said it would only make things worse for her if i fell behind in school because of her. I consulted some family and they agreed with her, so I just focused on taking care of my mom (i‚Äôm the oldest of 2 and my sibling is in highschool so i‚Äôm her primary caretaker). We have a spare room that is fully furnished, so my mom thought it would be a good idea to rent it so she could bring in some extra income. At the same time this was going on, we discovered that my boyfriend‚Äôs apartment has black mold, so he and my mom agreed that he would break his lease and move in, and pay $1,000 flat a month. This price would include utilities, toilet paper, food, ect. The only thing he would be paying was rent. The issue was, his apartment was charging him a crazy fee for breaking the lease, so he decided to wait it out a few months, and my mom let him move in again without mentioning money. 

So heres where I‚Äôm wondering if i‚Äôm overreacting. He started eating all the eggs. My mom usually buys 2 dozen, which last us about two weeks, sometimes more. We started running out of eggs every week, sometimes less. My mom‚Äôs tastebuds are destroyed from chemo, so the nice brand coffee she likes to drink has been mostly untouched. She only has MAYBE 1 cup per week. He drank it all. He finished most of the sugar. All of the utility bills have gone up. He finishes the toilet paper insanely fast and doesn‚Äôt buy more. My mom didn‚Äôt want to embarrass him, so she tried to be subtle about it, occasionally mentioning to him that bills were going up and she was having to buy groceries more often. They made a deal that he would buy his own eggs. He didn‚Äôt offer to pitch in or anything of the sort. It got to the point where I had to have a talk with him because it was upsetting my mom (rightfully so) that the whole point of him moving in was to generate some extra money because chemo was kicking her butt, and instead she ended up having to pay for even more stuff. He reluctantly gave her $200 to pay for the first two months that he had lived here. He continued to not pay, on top of other tensions that were building with him staying here that had nothing to do with money. Long story short, things got worse and my mom decided that it wasn‚Äôt going to work out, and gave him a little over a month to move out. He is going back to his apartment that he lived at before because he hasn‚Äôt broken the lease. He plans to give my mom another $200 dollars when he moves out. He doesn‚Äôt understand why my mom is annoyed with him. 

Am i overreacting? I just feel like any decent person staying with someone who they know is already struggling to make ends meet would feel compelled to offer to help out with at least something if he isn‚Äôt being charged rent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre a coffee lover who prioritizes health, you‚Äôre not alone. More people are turning to functional beverages that enhance physical and mental well-being. These drinks can offer a unique twist to your traditional coffee experience while adding valuable nutrients that support your health journey. Here are seven must-try functional beverages that you should incorporate into your daily routine.

### 1. Adaptogenic Coffee 

Adaptogenic coffee blends are crafted with herbs and mushrooms that help your body manage stress. Common adaptogens like ashwagandha and reishi mushrooms are popular choices. These ingredients not only maximize your coffee's energy boost but also support mental clarity and reduce anxiety. Try adding a scoop of adaptogenic powder to your morning brew for an extra health kick!

### 2. Matcha Latte 

For those who love a caffeine boost without the jitters, a matcha latte is an excellent alternative. Made from finely ground green tea leaves, matcha contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and focus. Mixing matcha with almond or oat milk can provide a creamy texture and delightful flavor. This beverage is packed with antioxidants and helps in boosting metabolism, making it a favorite for health-conscious individuals.

### 3. Turmeric Golden Milk 

Turmeric golden milk is a traditional Indian drink that has gained popularity due to its numerous health benefits. This beverage combines turmeric with milk (or non-dairy alternatives) and spices like ginger and cinnamon. Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has anti-inflammatory properties and can boost immunity. Enjoy this warm drink in place of your evening coffee for a comforting, healthful option.

### 4. Chai Tea 

If you're a fan of spiced flavors, chai tea should be on your radar. This beverage blends black tea with warming spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and clove. Chai can be enjoyed hot or iced and offers a good dose of antioxidants. The spices may even help improve digestion. Try it with a splash of your favorite milk for a delightful twist that can satisfy your coffee cravings.

### 5. Cold Brew with Collagen 

Cold brew coffee is smoother and less acidic than regular coffee, making it a popular choice among coffee enthusiasts. For added health benefits, consider enriching your cold brew with collagen powder. Collagen supports skin elasticity, joint health, and overall wellbeing. This combination not only boosts your caffeine intake but also promotes beauty from within. Just stir in collagen powder before you sip!

### 6. Beetroot Latte 

Beetroot lattes are a colorful and nutritious option for anyone looking to brighten up their beverage lineup. This drink combines beetroot powder with milk (or dairy-free options) and often includes spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. Beetroot is rich in vitamins, minerals, and nitrates that may enhance blood flow and stamina. It‚Äôs an energizing alternative to traditional coffee that still gives you a bit of caffeine if you opt for a coffee blend.

### 7. Yerba Mate 

Yerba mate is a South American herbal tea packed with antioxidants and nutrients. It contains caffeine, providing a gentle boost without the jitters. Many prefer yerba mate for its earthy flavor and numerous health benefits, including improved mental clarity and enhanced physical performance. Brew it hot or cold and enjoy it solo or blended with your favorite milk for a heartwarming experience.

Basically 5‚Äô 10‚ÄùF SW 210lbs CW 199lbs GW 167lbs. 

I calculated my TDEE and my allotted deficit calorie intake is between 1450-1600 calories a day. I walk three miles almost every day and try to hit 10k steps daily, but that‚Äôs about it for exercise. 

My problem now is I healed the whole ‚Äúeating for pleasure‚Äù thing, so I‚Äôm listening to my hunger cues and eating when I‚Äôm hungry and stopping when I‚Äôm full. However, since starting my diet my stomach must have shrank or something. I‚Äôm just not hungry like I used to be. 

My day tends to go:

Breakfast: coffee w creamer, big apple, cheese stick  (I‚Äôm not a huge breakfast person) 

Lunch: either two slices of avocado toast w eggs or huge chicken Caesar salad 

Dinner: usually a decent bit of protein with veggies or like pasta with veggies and protein. This is usually my biggest meal of the day. 

I‚Äôll snack on berries and fruit throughout the day but what keeps happening is I end up at about 1200-1300 calories total for the day. I usually burn about 300-400 walking so I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôm not getting enough. I‚Äôve lost like ten pounds in two weeks. I am technically overweight.

I don‚Äôt feel dizzy or tired or weak in anyway, in fact I‚Äôve been sleeping better than I have in years. It‚Äôs just weird.

1jo5oik,https://i.redd.it/ui83p6pfl1se1.jpeg,Weird name...,"I am waiting delivery today of this weirdly named grinder...(MHW-3BOMBER Electric Conical Burr Coffee Grinder}. It's stated to run at 140 RPM. Based on what I've watched and read, this grinder sounds very capable. I found it on discount for $287 (US). We do 2-3 types of coffee: pour over, French press and moka pot. We don't do espresso. 

It comes with a very long cord and power brick but that's the trade-off for a sleek machine. I heard that DC motors are usually more costly than AC motors. I don't know enough about those differences, pros - cons in the long term.

Looks easy to clean and retention is what's expected in this price range - at least that's the message by some reviewers. No bellows included but a natural looking brush and rubber blub blower is. I don't need nor want any plastic rubbery thingies anyway. My wife and I are interested in as little plastic in our world as possible. Bellows is simply another problem likely to release microplastics into my grind.

A grinder in the $300 range seems reasonable. 

I hope this works out for us.

I feel like this is an unpopular opinion here, as I've read a lot of disappointments, but I **loved** *Snshine on the Reaping*. It really reminded me of the first book, which is my favorite. Maybe because of that eternal debate of I like the arena/I don't like the arena.

*(To each their own when it comes to reading, you like and dislike whatever fiction you want and for whatever reasons you want. But you don't have to justify yourself, and even less judge or look down on others if they disagree with you.)*

I really liked the character of Maysilee, which was a pleasant surprise because for some reason I imagined her to be sweet like Madge, but she was more like Johanna.  I loved seeing her bond with the other tributes, especially Haymitch, seeing them share their possessions and look out for each other, and then become brothers and sisters.

I love the arena so much, as much as I hate that they have to be there. I love feeling strong emotions, and their losses were hard. Haymitch, who after Maysilee's death receives coffee and ice cream. Then, once back in the Capitol, he sees his teammates' sheets still undone and Maysilee's pajamas folded where she left them. Then, back home, he sees Merrilee and says, ""Maysilee!"" Oh, my heart broke. I get teary-eyed thinking about it and writing it.

Games are supposed to encourage individualism and bring out the worst in humanity. They need other ""players"" to die in order to win. But often, they need others to do so.  Camaraderie trumps individualism, and the ""winner"" will have to mourn their teammates. They refused to dehumanize themselves the way the Capitol did.

It was one of two major themes for me: the unity that is created in an extreme situation that pushes human limits too far, and propaganda. Suzanne handled it perfectly.


I first read the first book in December, then I read the second, third, and fourth in February. I was lucky enough to discover everything just before the fifth came out and was able to move on naturally. The question is, what can I do now?",5,1743434342.0,Hungergames,2,1.0,False

1jo5nd7,https://v.redd.it/b12pjah6l1se1,GF croissants recipe,"Not sure if usual thing is to share a link or a full recipe - so I pasted in the recipe which is also available on ‚Äúmy‚Äù site:

This recipe is a 16-30 hour process depending on how long you let the dough rest in the fridge - we make our dough in the morning at about 8.00 and the croissants are ready to be enjoyed the day after at lunch time (great for the afternoon coffee).


In addition to 400 grams of OhAh Pizza Mix, you need the following to make 10 gluten-free croissants:

(400 g pizza mix) 
30 g grated frozen butter 
280 ml/g Cold milk 
30 g Sugar 
15 g Fresh yeast 
12 g Salt

For the butter block you need 200 gs of butter (at least 80% fat, preferably 82%).

MAKING THE DOUGH

Freeze the butter (for the dough) at least 30 minutes before you are going to grate it (preferably longer).

In a small bowl pour in the milk and mix in the sugar. Mix until the sugar has dissolved.

Add the grated butter (immediately after grating it) to the flour and mix together. It is best to crumble it together with your fingers until you can no longer see any butter ‚Äúlumps‚Äù (we are wearing a plastic glove).

Dissolve the yeast in the milk and mix into the flour/butter mix. Mix together (either in a mixer with a rolling pin / dough hook, but you can also do it with your hands). When the dough starts to come together, add the salt and knead a little more.

Shape the dough into a rectangle (about 3cm high, and twice as long as wide), wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.


MAKING THE BUTTER BLOCK
200g butter

Cut 8 slices of 25g each (from a 500g butter package) and place 3*2 next to each other on a baking sheet. This will also be rectangular.

Fold the baking sheet over/together to make a small package, turn it over so that the ‚Äúfold‚Äù is at the bottom, and with a cable press, ‚Äútap‚Äù carefully and roll out the butter (but it is important not to lose its shape). You want to get the 4 pieces together until they are like a large sheet. You can turn the package over and do the same ‚Äúpress, tap, roll‚Äù until you get a smooth and pliable sheet. Place in the fridge for at least 12 hours.


TIME TO LAMINATE THE DOUGH
After 24 hours, take the dough out and let it rest for about 15 minutes on the table. Then take out the butter.

Flour (incredibly little) carefully with tapioca/potato starch on the table surface. Roll out the dough - you will both need to turn it over and flour it (again with incredibly little flour). And with your hands also shape/press in the sides (which may crack a little at first) so that you have a smooth and nice rectangular dough that can be lifted & moved. The dough should be about 32cm long, 26cm wide and 1cm high. We also always have a thin baking steel that we use to slide under the dough so that it never sticks.

Open the butter packet and place it in the middle of the dough. Fold in both sides of the dough and seal the block of butter by pressing the dough together all around (top and bottom), and pressing the dough together in the middle. You should now have a rectangle with the short side facing you. Carefully flour the top.

With a rolling pin, gradually press the dough upwards (so that you start to lengthen the dough). Do the same on the other joint. Flour carefully and turn the dough around. Do the same again. Flour carefully and turn the dough back so that the ‚Äúgathering side‚Äù is facing upwards. Now roll the dough up/down so that you get an increasingly longer dough. You may need to remove the dough from the table (with a thin baking steel) and also flour carefully so that the dough does not stick to either the rolling pin or the table. When the dough is about 0.8cm thick, cut the top and bottom end for a nice straight dough, fold in 1/3 from each side, turn 90 degrees and with a sharp knife, cut along the sides (so that you open the ‚Äúfolded‚Äù part of the dough).

Now roll again up-&down to lengthen the dough, until it is about 0.8cm thick again. Cut top and bottom, fold together (1/3 + 1/3), turn 90 degrees, cut the sides. And now quickly place on a cutting board and put in the freezer for 10 minutes.

Remove the dough from the freezer and after a minute or so, then roll it one last time up/down to lengthen the dough until it is about 0.8cm thick. Cut the ends, fold it together, cut the sides and put in the freezer again for 10 minutes.

Now the dough is ready to shape the croissants. Take it out of the freezer, let it rest for 1-2 minutes, and then roll out a dough that is about 34cm wide and 28cm high (again on a lightly floured surface) - where each croissant dough roll will be 8cm wide. cut all sides so they're straight. Then cut ""straight legged"" triangles to make the croissants - like in this picture here:



Slit each croissant roll at the bottom about 4cm and pull apart a little so you get a wider croissant. Roll up with a ""firm"" but not hard pressure and place on baking paper. You will have two ""halves"" of croissant lengths left that you can do something fun with.

Spray them with water and cover with either plastic (then you need to set a glass so that the plastic does not stick to the croissants) or a damp kitchen towel. Let rise for 3 hours at room temperature. You can spray them with water every hour so that they do not dry out.

 

PREPARING THE EGG WASH & BAKING:
One hour before you are going to bake them, turn the oven on to 200 degrees (fan), and take an egg out of the fridge and prepare the glaze: One egg yolk (NO egg white), and 0.5 tbsp milk. Mix together and let stand.

When it is time to bake, carefully brush the croissants. Place in the oven and bake for 9-10 minutes. Turn the baking sheet over (carefully because there may be some liquid butter) and bake for another 9-10 minutes.

Take out and transfer the croissants to a wire rack and let cool for a short while (if you can resist). Then all you have to do is enjoy crispy, buttery, wonderful croissants.",3,1743434267.0,glutenfreebaking,0,1.0,False

I thought I came to terms with our breakup; I accepted that the good and the bad all existed at the same time and that I cannot say that our relationship summed up to a ""net good"" or ""bad"". 

But seeing small reminders, like screenshots of the first message you sent me asking me out on a coffee date, and pictures of the letter you wrote to me marking our happy one month talking about how much I meant to you, how happy I made you, how I was always there for you. The way you bought me a stuffed animal just because I looked at it for a few seconds longer than anything else when we went shopping, and the way you just kept getting me stuffed animals when you found out how much I loved them. I really can't look at stuffed animals the same way anymore. I used to always fall asleep hugging one, but now I can't bear to let myself look at one for too long because half of my collection comes from you. 

You were my first relationship and I was so naive. I was so, so horribly naive and the way that this relationship and breakup has taught me wisdom is filled with pain. I know so much better now, I'm so much less foolish and so much less ignorant. I know how to keep myself from getting hurt now. But if I'm that much wiser, why does it hurt so much? Why does *knowing* hurt? 

I miss being that naive girl from the start of our relationship. I was so happy. I think I hate you for how I feel like I won't ever be that happy again -- because now I know to be more careful and now I know I cannot fully open my heart to new people I see. You taught me what the world is actually like, what society and the dating world is actually like, and I hate what I see. I hate being wiser, I hate it so much.

It‚Äôs looking like Kawhi Leonard might return to the Clippers lineup this evening, friends ‚Äì though to be frank, I don‚Äôt think Los Angeles requires him to cover a -2.5 spread against the Magic (even if they are playing on a back-to-back). To be honest, I think Orlando is getting overvalued here because they‚Äôve bagged wins in 4 of their last 5 outings ‚Äì but I think their late-season luck runs out today. The Clippers are far and away the better team in this matchup, and if Leonard returns? -2.5 is free money in my opinion. Give me Los Angeles to cover.

 However there's this one woman who has shopped (or should I say comes almost everyday, basically loiters at our mini eating area for hours, takes free oyster crackers, samples and free coffee) here for a few years and about a couple years ago approached me while I was walking down an aisle
and accused me of sitting behind her one day when I was on break and kicking her seat at the booth she was sitting at, I told her no I didn't (in the nicest way possible) and she pointed her finger at me and said ""yes you did"" and walked away, so I told a coworker (in a wtf, jokingly way) and she told me just ignore her since she's a little off anyway which I knew so I didn't think anything of it. 

And then this past Friday after I left work, one of the cashiers (not knowing it was her items, assuming it was left behind by a customer) brought her items to the front desk, she (after going to other stores in our plaza) came back saw her stuff was moved, went to the front desk, asked whoever was in the booth where her stuff was told her someone moved it since it was sitting there for a couple hours unattended, to which she responded to the boy in the customer service desk ""if it was (my name) tell her to keep her hands off my sh.t"" first of all this would've been hours after I left which the boy in the desk did say ""(my name) wasn't even there and someone else brought it up and the cashier who did it was just doing his job"" and I know she doesn't like me after the ""kicking"" accusations so obviously I wouldn't touch her shit just to get yelled at by her. 


But it's not just the kicking and moving her stuff accusations that bothers me the most because she's made all types of accusations against others too accused a customer of stalking her because he shops there often and has seen him multiple times there and a couple weeks ago accused one of our nighttime highschool cashier's of stalking her too because he got a sip of water while she so happened to be at one of the booths and made a complaint against him and on top of all that has followed a worker from a different department to his car into our employee parking lot.

Like I know managers don't want things to get messy so they try to avoid complications and confrontations, and they figure she's harmless but I am getting fed up that we let this woman come in, leave her stuff at one of our booths, walks around the store never buying anything, then makes a few phone calls, leaves her stuff at the booths for hours, shops around the plaza, comes back and never buys anything gets to just make accusations, make a cashier uncomfortable (he switched his availability to try and avoid getting another accusation from her) and has started arguments with the customer she's accused of stalking her (which we did check the cameras in the store to see if he was following her around and he wasn't, he just ate his lunch and left) and she just gets away with all of it. Apparently our store manager was gonna have a talk with her but she left before he could, so maybe they will actually say something to her but I don't think it'll happen. 

Tldr: Constant loiterer makes accusations, never buys anything, takes up a booth from the afternoon to the evening, leaves her items at the booth so no one will sit there thinking someone's already there, harassed a fellow employee, is rude anytime I (and anyone she's decided to find a reason to not like) tries to actually help her and nothing is said to her and I've just about had it.",3,1743433880.0,RantsFromRetail,2,1.0,False

I'll try and keep this as simple and quick as possible however I'm afraid it's going to be a little long.   
My roommate and I are on a fasting journey. I am quite familiar with fasting and the benefits, as I've began the journey many times over in the last several years...  
This last time that I have been fasting consistently, (began the end of February) my roommate decided to join me. I didn't prompt or ask, he just decided he wants to lose weight and reap the benefits I speak of.

  
There's a problem though; he seems to think that ""little things"" don't break a fast.   
I said, ""you don't understand fasting at all then, you can't have ANY calories during your fasting window. Like - NONE - we're (well, I'm) not 'dirty fasting'. I'm literally only drinking water or black coffee when I'm fasting.""

He will sneak food, a handful of crackers, a glass of juice, a late-night bowl of ice-cream. Then sometimes he tries to justify it - like today, I still have 2.5 more hours to go to get my 18 hrs in for fasting... he didn't want to wait 2 more hours because he's hungry, so he went to the fridge and grabbed two hard boiled eggs. He said ""well, I don't count it if it's healthy"" 

My jaw drops and I'm just incredulously trying to explain to him that he is NOT fasting. He doesn't understand fasting if he 'doesn't count liquids and snacks' and stuff... he's missing the entire point! It's more than a little maddening to me.

Many years ago, I had found a post here on reddit that was explaining fasting, and it was just the simplest terms and made it so easy to understand, but I can't find that original post and don't even remember exactly how it was stated. But I'm trying to explain it, but I feel like I'm unable to articulate it - I don't know if simply enough is the correct way of saying it - but I feel like he just doesn't understand.

Hi everyone. I am a medical doctor and have spent the past year writing online blog posts that other Reddit communities have enjoyed. I wanted to share this article with this community, as I felt some of you may find it interesting or informative. It is relatively detailed and occasionally technical. The [full blog post](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulinresistance/) exceeds the allowed character limit on Reddit, so the sections on Aerobic Exercise, Strength Training, Sleep, and Medications were truncated from the Reddit post. Have a great day.

**Introduction**

Insulin resistance is arguably the most significant health abnormality affecting humankind. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of insulin resistance in adults, adolescents, and children highlights the growing threat that insulin resistance poses to individuals of all ages. While insulin resistance is typically associated with obesity,¬†**insulin resistance can also affect those with a normal body weight**.^(1-3)¬†To demonstrate this point, it is estimated that 16% of school-aged children with a normal body weight have insulin resistance.^(4)¬†While it is widely recognized that insulin resistance contributes to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance also contributes to a constellation of serious and disabling health abnormalities, including several types of cancer, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoarthritis, muscle loss, frailty, and infertility.^(5-12)¬†Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that insulin resistance is a stronger risk factor of cardiovascular disease than elevated levels of LDL-C and Apolipoprotein B ([Link](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance)).^(13)¬†Therefore, the early identification of insulin resistance is necessary for those seeking to promote longevity and avoid preventable medical illness.

Meanwhile, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the most commonly utilized test for assessing blood glucose control. However,¬†**HbA1c is not an optimal test for identifying insulin resistance**. Specifically, it is a measurement of long-term blood glucose control and lacks the sensitivity to detect early stages of insulin resistance in those with normal blood glucose control (Figure 1).^(14,15)¬†As a result, the standard approach to diagnosing insulin resistance using HbA1c often allows insulin resistance to go undiagnosed until significant health problems arise. Similarly, Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) measure blood glucose fluctuations but may miss insulin resistance among those who are able to maintain normal blood glucose control, despite elevated levels of circulating insulin. Therefore, an optimal strategy is to utilize superior tests that identify insulin resistance prior to the onset of blood glucose dysregulation. This includes the¬†[**LPIR Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance/#LPIR),¬†[**Triglyceride-Glucose Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)¬†([**TyG Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)), and¬†[**HOMA-IR**](https://kevinforeymd.com/HOMA-IR/).

Importantly,¬†**insulin resistance is reversible in many cases**, especially when addressed early with comprehensive lifestyle changes. Strategies to prevent insulin resistance are similar to the strategies used to reverse insulin resistance. This generally includes dietary modification, physical fitness, and the optimization of sleep and stress. In select instances, supplements and prescription medications can also be effective, however,¬†**optimizing food and nutrition and physical fitness is more effective than medications**¬†**alone**.^(16)¬†Meanwhile, multiple strategies can be utilized simultaneously to maximize the likelihood of success. While the restriction of saturated fat is commonly recommended for the sake of reducing LDL cholesterol, this has no appreciable impact on improving insulin resistance.^(17)¬†Therefore, we will explore evidence-based strategies capable of improving insulin resistance and other components of Metabolic Syndrome.

**Content Summary**

* **Insulin resistance is more than a risk factor of type 2 diabetes**. It is also a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease, infertility, osteoarthritis, and frailty.^(5-12)¬†Furthermore,¬†**insulin resistance can also affect those with a normal body weight**.^(1-3)
* **Hemoglobin A1c, CGM, and fasting glucose tests often fail to detect early stages of insulin resistance**, as the body can maintain normal blood glucose values despite insulin resistance.^(14,15)¬†**Elevated levels of insulin are toxic to the body**¬†and occur years or decades before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation and abnormalities in HbA1c and CGM.^(14,15)
* **The most effective tests for detecting insulin resistance early**¬†include include the¬†[Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance (LPIR) Score](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance/#LPIR),¬†[Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) Index](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/), and¬†[HOMA-IR](https://kevinforeymd.com/homa-ir/). For early stages of insulin resistance, these tests are more accurate and sensitive compared to HbA1c or CGM.^(18-30)
* Importantly,¬†**insulin resistance is reversible in many cases**, especially when addressed early with comprehensive lifestyle changes that optimize food, nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress. Supplements and medications are also effective, however, comprehensive lifestyle changes appear most effective.^(16)¬†Meanwhile, all strategies can be used simultaneously.
* **Optimizing food and nutrition appears to be the most powerful tool for improving insulin resistance**.^(38)¬†Meanwhile, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (Zone 2) may be as effective, or even more effective, than high-intensity aerobic exercise.^(38)¬†Although aerobic exercise appears more effective than strength training alone, the combined benefit of aerobic exercise and strength training appear greater than the individual benefits of each modality alone.^(38)¬†Therefore,¬†**it is advisable to prioritize the combination of food and nutrition, aerobic exercise, and strength training, for the prevention and reversal of insulin resistance**.
* The¬†**Toxic Food Hypothesis**¬†proposes that¬†**highly processed foods disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance**¬†through two primary mechanisms. (1)¬†**Overconsumption**: excess calorie intake compared to whole foods;^(42)¬†and (2)¬†**Metabolic Dysfunction**: even at equal caloric intake, highly processed foods uniquely damage metabolic health.^(43)
* Rather than mainstream nutritional guidelines to¬†*‚Äúmaintain a healthy energy balance‚Äù*¬†and to¬†*‚Äúeat everything in moderation,‚Äù*¬†a more effective approach to the prevention and reversal of insulin resistance is to¬†**minimize or eliminate the regular consumption of highly processed foods**, including simple sugars and flour-based food products.
* **Improving the**¬†**quality**¬†**of carbohydrates consumed is likely more important than simply reducing the**¬†**quantity**¬†**of carbohydrates consumed**. Replacing simple sugars alone with complex carbohydrates results in appreciable reductions in body weight, insulin resistance, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, independent of calorie intake.^(43)
* **Reducing carbohydrate intake can raise ApoB levels**. To mitigate potential ApoB increases, strategies include increasing soluble and insoluble fiber intake, avoiding saturated fat intake from highly processed foods and industrially raised livestock, cooking with avocado oil instead of butter or coconut oil, and considering select plant-based meat alternative products.
* **Time-restricted eating may also improve insulin resistance independently of calorie reduction**, especially when meals are consumed earlier in the day to align with circadian rhythms.^(62,63)¬†Importantly, the evidence remains mixed and more research is needed to confirm whether or not there are unique benefits of time-restricted eating over calorie restriction.^(64,65)
* **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) offer**¬†instant, visual feedback, that can help to influence positive lifestyle changes, especially in those¬†**with**¬†insulin resistance. Meanwhile, in individuals¬†**without**¬†insulin resistance, the role of CGMs remains less clear due to the lack of reproducibility and consistency in CGM reported glucose values.^(66)
* **Optimizing sleep and managing stress are critical**¬†for improving insulin sensitivity. Even modest sleep deprivation or sleep fragmentation can significantly impair insulin action. Sleep quality, quantity, and timing are all important considerations regarding insulin resistance.^(87-94)
* **Medications and supplements such as Metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and berberine**¬†can be helpful adjuncts in treating insulin resistance, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Each has a distinct mechanism of action and set of side effects.

**What Is Insulin Resistance**

Insulin resistance is an abnormal health condition in which the body fails to effectively respond to the hormone insulin. Under normal circumstances, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream to regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin achieves blood glucose control by facilitating glucose uptake into liver, muscle, and fat tissue. It also plays a foundational role in directing fat storage and protein synthesis. The amount of insulin released by the pancreas is influenced by several factors, including the type of food consumed, the amount consumed, recent physical activity, stress levels, inflammation, pre-existing metabolic health, and other hormonal considerations.

In the case of insulin resistance, the body becomes less effective in its ability to respond to the hormone insulin. As a result, the body will compensate by releasing increased amounts of insulin into the circulation, a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. Importantly,¬†**hyperinsulinemia can occur before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation or elevations in blood glucose levels**, implying that insulin resistance can exist before the onset of abnormalities seen in HbA1c or CGM.^(14,15)¬†Meanwhile, even with normal blood glucose control, it is recognized that¬†**elevated levels of insulin contribute to**¬†**a toxic health environment, resulting in chronic inflammation, organ damage, and cellular dysfunction**. More specifically, while insulin resistance is widely recognized to contribute to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and dementia.^(5,6,31,32)¬†Insulin resistance also contributes to liver disease, kidney disease, and the increasing need for dialysis and organ transplantation.^(7,8)¬†Furthermore, insulin resistance is also associated with several disabling conditions, including osteoarthritis, muscle loss, frailty, and infertility (Table 2).^(9-12)¬†Collectively, the United States spends more money treating the abnormalities of type 2 diabetes than any other health condition, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.^(33)

Beyond insulin resistance is a broader health abnormality known as Metabolic Syndrome, which often manifests as some combination of excess abdominal obesity (visceral adiposity), high blood pressure (hypertension), elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and inflammation. It is estimated that 85% of adults have at least one component of Metabolic Syndrome, with insulin resistance being the primary, underlying health abnormality of this broader condition.^(34)¬†While many health experts and public health guidelines focus on body weight, often measured by Body Mass Index (BMI), and the restriction of calorie intake to improve body weight, Metabolic Syndrome is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than BMI alone (Table 2).^(13)¬†Meanwhile, Metabolic Syndrome captures additional risk associated with poor metabolic health to a far greater degree than body weight or BMI alone. Therefore, it is advisable to view comprehensive metabolic health from the standpoint of Metabolic Syndrome, insulin resistance, and its relationship to abnormal lipoprotein (cholesterol) concentrations, rather than body weight and obesity alone. Once again, you do not have to be overweight to have insulin resistance or other abnormalities of Metabolic Syndrome.^(4)

**Early and Accurate Identification of Insulin Resistance**

Because insulin resistance can exist before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation, traditional blood tests such as fasting glucose levels and HbA1c often fail to detect insulin resistance in its early stages.^(14,15)¬†As a result, insulin resistance may exist for years or decades before abnormalities in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, or CGMs are observed.¬†

Furthermore,¬†[**HbA1c can also be elevated in healthy individuals without insulin resistance**](https://kevinforeymd.com/hemoglobina1c/). Perhaps the most common circumstance in which a healthy individual may have an elevated HbA1c includes endurance athletes who are observed to have higher fasting glucose levels, likely due to the body‚Äôs regular demand for circulating blood glucose during times of prolonged physical activity, resulting in upregulated gluconeogenesis (increased production of glucose in the liver and kidneys).^(35)¬†Other potential factors include those with a prolonged red blood cell lifespan, iron deficiency, and certain medications.¬†

These examples of the limitations of HbA1c underscore the importance of utilizing tests that more directly assess insulin resistance compared to Hemoglobin A1c. Rather than utilizing a single biomarker alone, a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of insulin resistance should utilize the combination of the LPIR Score, TyG Index, HOMA-IR, and other assessments of metabolic health (Table 3).

* [**Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance#LPIR)¬†([**LPIR Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance#LPIR)): A useful blood test that analyzes changes in lipoprotein particle size and concentration to determine the presence and severity of insulin resistance. It is particularly helpful in detecting early stages of insulin resistance, including those with a normal body weight and normal blood glucose control.^(18,19)¬†Notably, the LPIR Score was developed and validated using data from the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, which is the most precise method for measuring insulin resistance (‚Äúthe gold standard‚Äù). Because the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp is labor-intensive, it is only used in research settings and not available as a routine laboratory test. Instead, the LPIR Score bridges this gap by providing a simple blood test that is a highly reliable surrogate marker of insulin resistance, and calibrated to the gold standard for measuring insulin resistance.
* [**Triglyceride-Glucose Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)¬†([**TyG Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)): This index is calculated using a formula that combines fasting triglyceride and fasting glucose levels, making it both cost-effective, accessible, and another useful test for detecting insulin resistance.^(20)¬†Research has demonstrated the TyG Index to be a superior predictor of insulin resistance compared to HbA1c and HOMA-IR.^(20)¬†Beyond insulin resistance,¬†**the TyG Index is strongly associated with lifespan (all-cause mortality), frailty, multiple types of cancer including breast and colon cancer, and dementia**.^(21-27)
* [**HOMA-IR**](https://kevinforeymd.com/HOMA-IR/): Another widely used test that utilizes fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. While HOMA-IR is highly sensitive, it is also susceptible to large day-to-day fluctuations in fasting insulin and glucose levels that may be influenced by factors unrelated to insulin resistance.^(28-30)¬†Therefore, HOMA-IR should be interpreted in conjunction with other testing strategies to provide a comprehensive analysis of insulin resistance.
* **Hemoglobin A1c**¬†(**HbA1c**): A measurement of long-term blood glucose control, not insulin resistance.¬† While there is a strong degree of correlation between blood glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance, the use of¬†**HbA1c is best for monitoring long-term blood glucose control in those with advanced states of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes**. Meanwhile, it appears less helpful for detecting early stages of insulin resistance.¬†

**Strategies to Prevent and Reverse Insulin Resistance**

There are a variety of effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance. This includes dietary modification, physical fitness, optimization of sleep, stress management, and in some instances, supplements and prescription medications. The same strategies used to reverse insulin resistance are typically effective for the prevention of insulin resistance. However, among those who are metabolically healthy and without evidence of insulin resistance, there is more leniency in the degree of adherence to these strategies necessary to prevent insulin resistance. Meanwhile, for those with insulin resistance, poor metabolic health, and/or a family history of insulin resistance, it is reasonable to implement as many of these strategies as possible. Additionally, it is advantageous to remain as disciplined as possible in following these strategies. Meanwhile, all individuals will respond differently to these interventions, and professional guidance from a licensed healthcare professional is necessary for ensuring safety.¬†

**Food, Nutrition, and Physical Fitness**

When evaluating the relative effectiveness of aerobic exercise, strength training, and dietary modification, all are effective strategies for reversing and preventing insulin resistance. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that¬†**dietary modification is the single most impactful strategy for reversing insulin resistance**¬†(Figure 2).^(38)¬†Meanwhile,¬†**moderate-intensity aerobic exercise appears to be equally as effective, or more effective, than vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise**. Both¬†**moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise appear more effective than strength training in isolation**. Interestingly, the combination of aerobic exercise and strength training demonstrates a positive synergistic effect, for which¬†**the combined benefit of aerobic exercise and strength training appear greater than the individual benefits of each modality**. Importantly, the greatest benefits in overcoming insulin resistance are achieved with the combination of maximizing and optimizing food and nutrition, aerobic exercise, and strength training.¬†

**Figure 2. Impact of Aerobic Exercise, Strength Training, and Dietary Modification on Insulin Sensitivity**^(38)

Note: The unit kcal/kg of body weight/week (KKW) is a measure of the prescribed amount of exercise in terms of energy expenditure relative to body weight over a one-week period.

**Optimizing Food and Nutrition**

Food and nutrition likely represents the most important modifiable risk factor regarding insulin resistance and the array of health abnormalities associated with Metabolic Syndrome. Meanwhile, the subject of food and nutrition is highly controversial, with conflicting perspectives and nutritional priorities. While some health experts take a cautious approach, offering broad, non-controversial recommendations, such as maintaining a healthy energy balance, follow a Mediterranean diet, and prioritize physical activity, a more precise and scientific approach is required to fully address the complexities of metabolic health and insulin resistance.

**The Toxic Food Hypothesis**

Over the past century, rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and Metabolic Syndrome have risen dramatically, largely due to fundamental changes in the food system.^(39,40)¬†The transition from naturally occurring whole foods to a diet dominated by highly processed products now accounts for nearly 60% of total calorie intake in the United States.^(41)¬†Despite growing evidence linking highly processed foods to poor metabolic health, mainstream nutrition guidelines continue to emphasize a ‚Äúbalanced diet‚Äù without adequately addressing the unique harms of these foods. The common recommendation to ‚Äú*eat everything in moderation*‚Äù fails to acknowledge that some foods are inherently detrimental to human health. Rather than moderation, a more effective approach is to¬†**minimize or eliminate the regular consumption of highly processed foods**.

The¬†**Toxic Food Hypothesis**¬†proposes that highly processed foods disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Overconsumption**: Processed foods promote excessive calorie intake compared to whole foods.^(42)
2. **Metabolic Dysfunction**: Even at equal caloric intake, highly processed foods uniquely damage metabolic health.^(43)

The Toxic Food Hypothesis challenges the conventional calorie-centric model, emphasizing that food quality, not just quantity, is critical for metabolic health. Addressing insulin resistance requires more than simply adding healthier foods, it necessitates a fundamental shift away from highly processed foods.

**Defining Highly Processed Foods**

A common critique of the Toxic Food Hypothesis is the difficulty of defining ‚Äú*highly processed foods.*‚Äù While classification systems like NOVA‚Äôs ‚Äúultra-processed foods‚Äù exist, there are several notable limitations and shortcomings. Given the vast diversity and complexity of the modern food supply, rigid definitions are impractical. A typical grocery store carries more than 30,000 food products, for example.¬† Instead, a more useful approach is to consider processed foods qualitatively along a spectrum:

**Naturally Occurring ‚Üí Minimally Processed ‚Üí Highly Processed ‚Üí Ultra-Processed**

For this discussion,¬†**highly processed foods refer to products that cannot be made at home using simple ingredients and basic food preparation techniques**. Importantly, cooking is not the same as industrial food processing. Unlike household food preparation techniques (e.g., chopping vegetables, heating food, grinding peanuts to make peanut butter), industrial food processing involves chemical modifications and additives that fundamentally alter food composition. While not all processed foods are harmful, many contribute to poor metabolic health.

**Strategies for Optimizing Food and Nutrition**:

1. **Minimize or Eliminate Added and Refined Sugars**: A deliberate avoidance of highly processed foods, including highly processed sugars and carbohydrates, likely represents the greatest health opportunity for the majority of individuals with insulin resistance. To optimize health, individuals should aim to reduce or avoid added sugars found in sweets, candy, sodas, energy drinks, flavored coffee drinks, and sugar-containing condiments. Sugars contained in fruit juices should also be avoided, even if ‚Äúall natural‚Äù or ‚Äúorganic.‚Äù Additionally, highly refined carbohydrates containing sugar should be avoided, including pastries, muffins, breakfast cereals, and many processed snack-foods. Among those with insulin resistance, restricting added and refined sugar to less than 15 grams per day is a reasonable goal.¬†
2. **Improve Carbohydrate Quality**:¬†Significant health improvements can be made by focusing on the quality of the calories we consume. Research has shown that simply replacing high-fructose corn syrup with an equal amount of calories from starch-based carbohydrates can lead to noticeable improvements in insulin resistance, blood pressure, body weight, inflammation, and LDL cholesterol (Figure 3).^(43)¬†These benefits were observed within just two weeks, without any reduction in total calorie or carbohydrate intake. Instead, the key change was a deliberate shift toward higher-quality carbohydrates and the elimination of added and refined sugars. Practical Examples to Improve Carbohydrate Quality:
   * Replace¬†**soda**¬†**‚Üí flavored sparkling water**.
   * Replace¬†**pasta**,¬†**sandwiches**, and¬†**grains**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**salad**;¬†**eat more salad**!
   * Replace¬†**french fries**¬†and¬†**onion rings**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**saut√©ed**¬†or¬†**grilled vegetables**.
   * Replace¬†**white rice**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**riced cauliflower**,¬†**whole grains**, or¬†**legumes**.
   * Replace¬†**chips**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**mixed nuts**,¬†**carrots and almond butter**, or¬†**sliced peppers and hummus**.
   * Replace¬†**granola**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**mixed nuts with cinnamon**.
   * Replace a¬†**sugar-containing dessert**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**mixed fruit**. Note: Be mindful of the sugar content in common fruits; those with insulin resistance should preferentially select fruits with low sugar content (Table 5).^(44)

**Figure 3. Stepwise Approach to Improving Carbohydrate Quality**

1. **Advanced Analysis of Carbohydrate Quality**: To better understand carbohydrate quality, several advanced nutritional metrics can offer valuable insight. Key among these are the¬†**Insulin Index**¬†and¬†**Glycemic Load**¬†(not the Glycemic Index), both of which are particularly useful in assessing food choices for individuals with insulin resistance (Table 4). Choosing foods that are low in both Glycemic Load and Insulin Index can lead to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity.¬†^(45-48)¬†In addition, other useful metrics include the¬†**Percent Fiber of Total Carbohydrate**¬†and the¬†**Protein-to-Carbohydrate Ratio**¬†(Table 4). While daily monitoring of these metrics is not necessary, they serve as useful reference points to scientifically evaluate food choices, illustrating a clear pattern from naturally occurring to highly processed foods, as shown in Table 4. While the¬†**Glycemic Index**¬†is widely understood and commonly used, it is less reliable for daily dietary decisions. Research suggests that alternative methods like Glycemic Load offer more consistent outcomes regarding the improvement of insulin resistance.^(49)

Note: This article is not meant to demonize fruit. However, clinical research has demonstrated that increasing fruit intake, without making other dietary changes, can worsen insulin resistance, blood sugar control, and liver inflammation, in individuals with poor metabolic health at baseline.^(44)

1. **Reduce Total Carbohydrate Intake**: In addition to improving the quality of carbohydrates consumed, reducing total carbohydrate intake is often necessary for individuals with advanced insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. Well-designed clinical trials have shown that carbohydrate restriction is an effective strategy for improving insulin resistance.^(50-54)¬†Because highly processed foods are disproportionately composed of highly refined carbohydrates, most studies evaluating ‚ÄúCarbohydrate Restriction‚Äù or ‚ÄúLow-Carbohydrate Diets‚Äù are indirectly evaluating the impact of restricting highly processed foods. Although reducing saturated fat is commonly recommended for lowering ApoB and LDL-C levels, it does not meaningfully improve insulin resistance.^(17)¬†In randomized clinical trials, Carbohydrate Restriction and the Mediterranean Diet often outperform Low-Fat Diets.^(50,55)¬†When compared directly, Carbohydrate Restriction may be equal to or even more effective than the Mediterranean Diet.^(50,56-58)¬†Importantly, the Mediterranean Diet shares several key components with many forms of Carbohydrate Restricted Diets, including (1) increased intake of dietary fats from natural sources like mixed nuts and olive oil, (2) reduced consumption of highly refined carbohydrates, and (3) greater focus on whole grains and legumes. How closely an individual adheres to carbohydrate restriction depends on their unique circumstances and healthcare goals. For those with insulin resistance, it is important to discuss with a licensed healthcare professional to determine safe and appropriate targets. A common strategy is to reduce total carbohydrate intake by about 20-30%. For context, the average American adult consumes at least 240 grams of carbohydrates per day, with adult males averaging 260 to 300 grams per day.^(59-60)¬†Additionally, the intake of added and refined sugars should be limited to less than 10 to 15 grams per day. Research by Christopher Gardner, Ph.D., and colleagues has shown that significant improvements in insulin resistance can be achieved with a total carbohydrate intake of less than 140 grams per day, with additional benefits from further restriction (Table 6).^(61)¬†However, the quality of carbohydrates remains the most important factor, with a focus on minimizing or eliminating added sugars, refined sugars, and highly processed carbohydrate-rich foods. This article is not intended to advocate for a single approach, but rather, to emphasize the importance of avoiding highly processed foods, especially added and refined carbohydrates, which disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance.

1. **Consider Time-Restricted Eating**:¬†Both calorie restriction and time-restricted eating can improve insulin resistance, but emerging evidence suggests that time-restricted eating may offer distinct advantages. Some studies have demonstrated that time-restricted eating alone can result in an improvement in insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function, and metabolic health, even without a reduction in calorie intake.^(62)¬†Other clinical trials have achieved improvements in metabolic health utilizing time restricted eating, particularly when meals are consumed earlier in the day, aligning with circadian rhythms.^(63)¬†Importantly, the evidence remains mixed and more research is needed to confirm whether or not there are unique benefits of time-restricted eating over calorie restriction.^(64,65)¬†In theory, at a cellular level, a prolonged duration of fasting will promote greater improvements and recovery of insulin resistance when no calories are being consumed and no insulin is being secreted. In contrast, caloric restriction continues to stimulate insulin secretion, even when calorie intake is reduced. Therefore, as we await additional scientific research, it remains plausible that time-restricted eating may offer unique benefits for the sake of improving insulin resistance. Meanwhile, caloric restriction and time-restricted eating are both effective strategies for improving insulin resistance.
2. **Track Glucose Levels Continuously**: Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) provide real-time feedback regarding glucose fluctuations in response to food intake, physical activity, stress, sleep, and medications. By offering instant, visual feedback, CGMs provide personalized data that can help to influence positive lifestyle changes. For example, if a particular food causes a glucose spike, choosing an alternative food or reducing the portion size may help to improve insulin resistance. This is particularly helpful and relevant to those¬†**with**¬†insulin resistance, where real-time, day-to-day feedback of food choices and the resultant blood glucose control can help to inform and modify daily decision making.¬† Meanwhile, in individuals¬†**without**¬†insulin resistance, the role of CGMs remains less clear due to the lack of reproducibility and consistency in CGM reported blood glucose values.^(66)¬†Furthermore, glucose spikes to 140 to 150 mg/dL are normal and should not necessarily cause alarm and anxiety. Recent scientific research has acknowledged the reality that CGMs can overestimate the prandial glucose response when compared to capillary finger sampling.^(67)¬†Given that lack of clear thresholds, issues with reproducibility, and issues with accuracy, CGMs should not be used to diagnose insulin resistance, but should instead provide insight into those with blood glucose dysregulation and the need to further evaluate the possibility of insulin resistance.

**Balancing ApoB, Insulin Resistance, and Individual Circumstances**

Reductions in carbohydrate intake often leads to an increased consumption of dietary fats, including saturated fats. While the degree of carbohydrate processing significantly influences health, the same applies to dietary fats, where the source and composition matter. Importantly, higher saturated fat intake can elevate ApoB levels,^(68)¬†however, this effect varies considerably^(69)¬†depending on the type and quality of saturated fat consumed,^(70)¬†as well as individual biological and genetic factors. Given these complexities, individuals making dietary changes should monitor blood work, including ApoB, to assess their individual response. For those looking to optimize ApoB levels or mitigate potential increases associated with carbohydrate restriction, several dietary strategies can be considered:

1. **Increase Fiber Intake:**¬†Increasing fiber intake, particularly¬†**soluble fiber**, is an effective strategy for lowering LDL-C and ApoB. Soluble fiber found in foods such as psyllium, oats, barley, beans, and lentils, binds to bile acids and cholesterol, reducing absorption and increasing excretion, which in turn leads to greater LDL-C clearance and reduced ApoB levels. Clinical studies suggest that consuming 10 grams of soluble fiber per day can lower LDL-C by approximately 10 mg/dL.^(71,72)¬†**Insoluble fiber**, found in wheat bran, whole grains, nuts, and vegetables, has also been shown to lower LDL-C and ApoB by increasing fecal bulk and reducing intestinal transit time. While its effects on ApoB are less pronounced than those of soluble fiber, it is another strategy for lowering ApoB.^(73,74)
2. **Limit Consumption of Saturated Fat From Highly Processed Foods**: Saturated fats from highly processed foods can raise ApoB levels. These include processed meats, processed cheese products (e.g., American cheese, cheese spreads), many ready-to-eat and frozen meals, packaged snacks, certain baked goods, and fast food restaurants. Reducing intake of industrially manufactured and processed foods is a reasonable strategy for optimizing saturated fat intake and ApoB levels.¬†
3. **Replace Butter and Coconut Oil with Avocado Oil**: When cooking, replacing butter or coconut oil with avocado oil reduces saturated fat intake while avoiding reliance on highly processed oils like canola or soybean oil. Avocado oil is predominantly composed of monounsaturated fats, which are associated with favorable lipid profiles and remains stable at high cooking temperatures.¬†
4. **Limit Consumption of Industrial Raised Livestock**: Industrial-raised, grain-fed livestock have a less favorable fatty acid profile than grass-fed livestock. Grass-fed beef and dairy, for example, contain 2‚Äì5 times higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, a higher proportion of stearic acid (which has a neutral effect on LDL-C and ApoB), and greater levels of antioxidants compared to grain-fed livestock.^(75,76)¬†Preferentially selecting high-quality, naturally raised animal products is another approach to improving the quality and composition of dietary fat consumed.
5. **Consider Select Plant-Based Meat Alternative Products**: Some plant-based meat alternatives, such as tofu and tempeh, are minimally processed and provide beneficial metabolic effects. However, newer plant-based substitutes vary widely in ingredient quality and processing methods. While some use whole-food ingredients and natural seasonings, others contain industrially processed components similar to traditional processed foods. Some studies suggest that plant-based meat alternatives may contribute to favorable metabolic health outcomes, including improvements in insulin resistance and reductions in LDL-C.^(77,78)¬†However, not all studies have demonstrated improvements in LDL-C,^(79)¬†and the impact on ApoB remains less well studied. When incorporating these products, selecting options with minimal additives and a whole-food-based ingredient list is preferable.¬†

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making the switch from regular coffee to mushroom-infused alternatives can be an exciting journey. You‚Äôre not just changing your drink; you‚Äôre embracing a new lifestyle that focuses on health and wellness. Here are some strategies to help you smoothly transition to mushroom-based beverages, while also maximizing the health benefits they offer.

### Start Slow

Begin by gradually reducing your coffee intake. If you drink three cups of coffee daily, cut back to two cups for a week. During this time, introduce a mushroom coffee blend. Starting with a mix can make the transition easier on your palate.

### Choose the Right Mushroom Blend

Different types of mushrooms provide various health benefits. Here are some popular choices:

- **Reishi:** Known for its calming effects, perfect for bedtime.
- **Chaga:** Great for boosting immunity and enhancing energy.
- **Lion‚Äôs Mane:** Supports cognitive functions and enhances focus.
- **Cordyceps:** Excellent for improving athletic performance.

Pick a blend that resonates with your wellness goals. Look for products that have organic certification and no added sugars for the best health benefits.

### Create a New Morning Ritual

If you usually enjoy a cup of coffee every morning, replace this with a mushroom-infused beverage. Perhaps you can prepare a warm concoction, adding healthy ingredients like cinnamon or nutmeg for flavor. By creating a new morning ritual, you‚Äôll help ease the mental transition while still enjoying your daily routine.

### Experiment with Flavor

The taste of mushroom coffee can be quite different from standard coffee. You might find it earthy and rich. To make it more enjoyable, consider adding:

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
- Almond milk or oat milk for creaminess
- Honey or maple syrup for sweetness
- Cacao powder for a chocolatey flavor

Try various recipes until you find one that you love. Mixing flavors will help mask any strong mushroom taste while still providing the benefits.

### Stay Hydrated

As you reduce caffeine from coffee, ensure you drink plenty of water. Hydration is essential for your body to adjust. Dehydration can result in headaches as you cut back on coffee, so it‚Äôs crucial to stay on top of your water intake.

### Be Mindful of Withdrawal Symptoms

Changing your caffeine routine may come with withdrawal symptoms like headaches or fatigue. Be patient; these effects usually pass within a week. During this period, make sure to take care of yourself by resting and consuming healthy foods that can boost your energy levels.

### Track Your Progress

Keep a journal noting how you feel each day. You can log any changes in energy levels, focus, and mood. This will not only motivate you but will also help you see the benefits of the transition. Adjust your mushroom coffee consumption based on how you feel and if you miss your regular coffee.

### Join a Community

Connecting with others who are also transitioning can provide encouragement and new ideas. Look for online forums or local groups focused on health and wellness. Sharing experiences and recipes can make the journey more enjoyable.

The Health Benefits of Mushroom Coffee Compared to Traditional Coffee
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee is a staple for many people around the world, providing a daily boost of energy and comfort. However, as more individuals seek healthier alternatives, mushroom-infused coffee is gaining popularity. This innovative blend offers unique health benefits that distinguish it from traditional coffee. If you're curious about how mushroom coffee measures up against your regular brew, you‚Äôre in the right place.

First, let‚Äôs discuss how traditional coffee can affect your body. While it does provide a quick source of energy thanks to caffeine, it often comes with some drawbacks. These can include anxiety, jitters, and stomach issues for some people. In contrast, mushroom coffee combines the energizing effects of coffee with the adaptogenic properties of certain mushrooms, creating a unique blend that supports both mental and physical well-being.

### Energy Without the Jitters

Mushroom coffee offers a more balanced energy boost compared to traditional coffee. While coffee can lead to spikes in energy followed by crashes, mushroom coffee often contains adaptogens like lion's mane and cordyceps. These mushrooms help regulate and support energy levels, providing a steady and sustained boost without the jitters often associated with regular coffee.

### Enhanced Cognitive Function

One of the standout benefits of mushroom coffee is its potential to improve cognitive function. Lion's mane mushroom, for example, is known for its neuroprotective properties. Studies suggest it may promote the growth of nerve cells, which can enhance memory, focus, and overall brain health. In contrast, regular coffee may contribute to temporary alertness, but it does not offer the same supportive benefits for long-term cognitive performance.

### Improved Digestion

When you enjoy your morning coffee, the acidity can sometimes irritate your stomach. Mushroom coffee, particularly varieties blended with chaga or reishi mushrooms, tends to be less acidic and gentler on the digestive system. These mushrooms are renowned for their anti-inflammatory properties, making mushroom coffee a great option for those who often experience stomach discomfort from regular coffee.

### Rich in Antioxidants

Both coffee and mushroom coffee are rich in antioxidants, but mushroom coffee can take this a step further. Mushrooms such as chaga are known for high levels of antioxidants, which can help combat oxidative stress in the body. This rich antioxidant profile can support immune health and reduce inflammation, something that regular coffee lacks in comparison.

### Immune System Support

If you‚Äôre keen on bolstering your immune system, switching to mushroom coffee can be beneficial. Varieties like reishi are celebrated for their immune-boosting properties. While traditional coffee doesn't offer significant support in this area, mushroom coffee brings in the extra nutrients needed to help your body fend off illness and maintain vigor.

### What About Adaptogens?

Adaptogens are natural substances that enhance the body‚Äôs resistance to stress. In mushroom coffee, mushrooms such as cordyceps and reishi serve as powerful adaptogens. They can help your body adapt to physical and mental stressors more effectively than traditional coffee would. As a result, you not only get an energy boost but also improved resilience against stress.

### How to Make the Switch

If you‚Äôre considering transitioning from traditional coffee to mushroom coffee, start slowly. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to help you make the switch:

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
- **Mix it Up:** Begin by blending regular coffee with mushroom coffee. This allows your taste buds to adjust.
- **Try Different Brands:** Not all mushroom coffees are created equal. Experiment with different brands to find the one you enjoy the most.
- **Be Patient:** Your body might take some time to adjust to the new flavor and effects. Give it a couple of weeks before deciding if you like it.

Transitioning to mushroom coffee can provide numerous health benefits. With its unique blend of flavors and supportive properties, it may very well be a healthier alternative to your traditional cup of joe. Embracing this shift can pave the way for improved energy, mental clarity, and overall wellness.

With its growing popularity, you might find mushroom coffee options at your local grocery store or specialty shops. Don‚Äôt hesitate to explore and perhaps find a new favorite that not only tastes great but also enhances your lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Transitioning from regular coffee to mushroom-infused alternatives can open up a world of health benefits and improved well-being. By implementing simple strategies such as gradual substitution, experimenting with flavors, and being mindful of caffeine intake, you can make your shift seamless and enjoyable. It‚Äôs essential to listen to your body during this process. Each person adjusts differently, so finding the right balance for your lifestyle is key.

Mushroom coffee presents an array of health benefits that can surpass those of traditional coffee. The inclusion of mushrooms like reishi, chaga, and lion‚Äôs mane not only adds a rich, earthy flavor but also enhances cognitive function, supports immune health, and balances energy levels without the jitters often associated with regular caffeine consumption. Many people report experiencing improved mood and better focus after incorporating mushroom coffee into their daily routine.

As you embark on this journey, remember that the goal is not just to replace your morning cup but to enhance your overall health while enjoying your beverage. Embracing mushroom-infused coffee can lead to a more nourishing start to your day, introducing you to unique flavors and potential wellness boosts. With some patience and creativity, transitioning to these alternatives can be a positive dietary change that supports both your mind and body, ultimately enriching your daily coffee ritual.

Liam (my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend) has recently come to me asking for advice on improving his health. Liam is extremely over weight. 

I‚Äôve been training him in the gym. I‚Äôve been giving him a workout plan that fits his schedule. I‚Äôve been teaching him proper form, progressive overload, training til failure, and alternatives to certain exercises in case a machine is taken because he can only go in the evening.

I‚Äôve also been giving him pointers on healthier eating habits. I‚Äôm a big fan of ‚Äúmicro-changes‚Äù. Because complete diet changes set a lot of people up for failure and are hard to manage long term. Things like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you go to Dunkin every day and get a large iced coffee with 5 creams and 6 sugars, maybe get a medium. or do 4 creams and 5 sugars‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf you go to mcdonald‚Äôs and get a big mac, maybe try a double cheeseburger and add mac sauce and lettuce‚Äù I‚Äôve been giving him pointers for making little adjustments like that. 

He‚Äôs not been listening to my advice. This man EATS. Every time we‚Äôve gone out to dinner he orders an appetizer, sometimes two, and gets an entree. We went to a place which is basically bar taco, and he gets 2-3 apps and like 16-18 tacos, and empanadas. We went to perkins one time and he got an entree, asked for chocolate chips in the pancakes, side of whip cream, an extra bowl of gravy, and extra side of hash browns. He also always orders a soda with no ice so he gets more soda. He just absolutely pigs out and has to upgrade everything he gets. He thinks not eating all day and only eating dinner will help him lose weight. I said to him he might over eat with dinner because he‚Äôs starving and that I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea. He also at least 2-3 times a week tells me about a new fast food item coming out. 

Recently he called me and told me about how he had 600 mg of caffeine. And I said that maybe that wasn‚Äôt healthy and he should be careful. Especially recently with the few people in their 20‚Äôs who have died of caffeine overdose. He said he doesn‚Äôt drink like that often and that he‚Äôs being drinking that much + more since forever. And I said well it‚Äôs okay until one day it‚Äôs not and he‚Äôs getting older now. 

Apparently the day after this conversation he told Donna that he was gonna have a talk with me because he‚Äôs upset with how I‚Äôm always talking about his body. To my knowledge I‚Äôve never said anything about the physical appearance of his body. Just his eating and caffeine consumption habits. He also came to me for advice. He‚Äôs very sensitive about this and he seems to not want to face how unhealthy his habits are. Donna has said to me that she‚Äôs afraid she‚Äôs gonna be a widow and I agreed.  Liam was told this and instead of it giving him some encouragement he said ‚ÄúWow you guys really think I‚Äôm that unhealthy‚Äù and i just wanted to say ‚ÄúYESSSSS‚Äù

My name is Niyazi, I‚Äôm from Ankara. It was 2013. Back then, I worked as an attendant in a large cold storage warehouse; a depot where red meat was kept. I was young, only 23 years old. I lived alone in an attic apartment. My family lived in the village; I had migrated from the village to live in the city. I planned to establish my own life and live a bachelor‚Äôs life until I got married.

And of course, being a bachelor‚Äôs pad, friends and buddies inevitably came and went. One day we‚Äôd cook together, another day play okey, another day watch movies. Especially when I first arrived, I spent a lot of time with two friends named Mevl√ºt and Mehmet from the market where I worked for a couple of months. Mehmet still worked at the market, while Mevl√ºt had started working as a waiter in a cafe. They lived together, but there were five people in total in their house. Sometimes we went to their place, but since my place was quieter, they usually came to mine.

When we met, we watched all kinds of movies, but the genre we all particularly loved was horror films. One day, my friend Mevl√ºt, who worked at the cafe, called me. ‚ÄúA new horror movie just dropped online, let‚Äôs watch it tonight right away, okay?‚Äù he said. I worked one week day shifts, one week night shifts. That week I was working nights and had to go to work at 1 AM, so I told him our time would be limited. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we organize it for next week?‚Äù I asked. Mevl√ºt replied, ‚ÄúI already told Mehmet. If we start watching around 7-8, you‚Äôll definitely make it. Don‚Äôt be a party pooper!‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, okay, fine. But don‚Äôt be late,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSure, we‚Äôll come around late afternoon anyway. We‚Äôll go out, grab a few things, then sit down and watch our movie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOkay, sounds good, deal,‚Äù I replied.

Half an hour passed, and Mevl√ºt called me again. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a new guy who just started at our cafe, can he come too? Would that bother you?‚Äù he asked. Frankly, I didn‚Äôt want to bring someone I didn‚Äôt know well into my home. After all, you never know if they‚Äôre trouble or a thief. I hesitated a bit, but Mevl√ºt said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs a solid guy, a good kid.‚Äù Hearing that, I couldn‚Äôt refuse, ‚ÄúOkay, let him come,‚Äù I said. After tidying up the house a bit, they called saying they had arrived in the neighborhood late afternoon. I went down and met them. After shaking hands with Mehmet and Mevl√ºt, I met Berkan, Mevl√ºt‚Äôs friend from the cafe. He was a strange kid who mumbled when he spoke.

Later, we went to the market to buy some snacks and drinks for the movie. I suggested we get coffee too. Mevl√ºt said to me, ‚ÄúShould we get Turkish coffee? We can drink it. Hey, listen, Berkan reads fortunes really well, we can have him read ours one by one, how about that?‚Äù I was about to say ‚Äúno,‚Äù but this time Mehmet jumped in: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you read fortunes at the cafe anyway, Berkan my brother?‚Äù Berkan replied, ‚ÄúYes, I do. And I read well, no need to be modest,‚Äù and gave a smile. Since everyone seemed so keen, I didn‚Äôt want to spoil the mood and couldn‚Äôt object. ‚ÄúOkay, fine,‚Äù I said.

Berkan asked, ‚ÄúIs there a glassware shop or something around here?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúThere used to be one on the back street, but why?‚Äù ‚ÄúI want to buy a nice cup set to read the fortunes. Plus, it‚Äôs my first time coming to your house, it‚Äôll be a housewarming gift,‚Äù he said. When I said, ‚ÄúBut I have cups at home‚Ä¶‚Äù he cut me off, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù After finishing our market shopping, we went to the glassware shop. Since Berkan was buying it as a gift, I held back a bit, thinking he might buy something affordable according to his budget. After the shop owner showed us the cup sets, Berkan didn‚Äôt like any of them and asked, ‚ÄúSir, don‚Äôt you have any wooden cup sets?‚Äù The man said, ‚ÄúWell, there should be one set in the storage room, they aren‚Äôt very popular. I need to check.‚Äù The man must not have trusted us, because he said, ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs all go down and look together.‚Äù The place he called storage was a large, dreary, dark place that didn‚Äôt get any sunlight. After a long search using the light from our phones, the shop owner pulled out a wooden cup set from a dusty box. We went upstairs, Berkan paid, and then we went home. I thanked him, ‚ÄúThere was really no need,‚Äù I said. Berkan replied, ‚ÄúWooden cups are good.‚Äù

It was starting to get dark. After eating something, we connected the laptop to the TV. Since it was properly evening now, the mood for watching a horror movie was set. We started watching the film. Although the movie was generally monotonous, there was a scene where the characters sat around a table in the living room chatting. While chatting, one of them felt dizzy. As the other characters tried to help, the dizzy character pointed towards the door with their finger. An entity entered through the door. It was a genuinely creepy scene. Other than that, we generally didn‚Äôt like the movie. Mevl√ºt even jokingly said, ‚ÄúThe screenwriter stole 2 hours of my life.‚Äù

Since none of us were happy with the movie, Berkan said, ‚ÄúForget about these fictional things. Come on, let‚Äôs make our own movie.‚Äù We all turned to Berkan, wondering what he was up to. Berkan said, ‚ÄúI saw it somewhere, let‚Äôs summon a jinn, come on.‚Äù We all froze for a moment, then Mevl√ºt laughed, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs summon one, it‚Äôll definitely come running!‚Äù I was looking at them like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù but since I had just met Berkan and was the host, I couldn‚Äôt say anything definitive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unnecessary, I think, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù I said. Mevl√ºt replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just for fun, buddy, it‚Äôs not like a real jinn is actually going to show up, right?‚Äù It was really strange how Mevl√ºt trusted this guy he had only known for a week or ten days so much, just because they worked together, and immediately agreed with him. I asked Mehmet, ‚ÄúWhat do you say?‚Äù hoping he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúForget it, let‚Äôs just sit properly.‚Äù When Mehmet said, ‚ÄúI go with the flow, buddy,‚Äù Mevl√ºt jumped up, ‚ÄúAlright then!‚Äù

I had a foldable table; we pulled it in front of the TV. Berkan went to his coat hanging on the rack and took out two large white candles from his pocket. ‚ÄúYou came quite prepared,‚Äù I said sharply to Berkan. He looked at me, smiled, and then placed one of the wooden cups he bought for me in the center of the table. We sat at the four corners of the table. We turned off the lights and the TV. He lit the two candles in the middle of the table. A creepy atmosphere formed immediately. Mevl√ºt secretly kicked the table with his foot to make a noise and said, ‚ÄúAha, it‚Äôs here! I swear it‚Äôs here!‚Äù His nervous giggle made me mutter ‚ÄúLa hawla‚Äù (There is no power except with Allah). Mehmet was equally tense, on the verge of snapping at Mevl√ºt. Berkan didn‚Äôt fail to smile at Mevl√ºt‚Äôs mischievous joke either.

Berkan said, ‚ÄúOkay, we laughed, had fun. Now let‚Äôs get a little scared,‚Äù and went to the kitchen. He returned with a knife in his hand. He started carving something onto the wooden cup that was placed upside down in the middle. All of us, including Mevl√ºt, watched in astonishment. First, he carved a triangular shape onto the base of the cup with the knife. Then, I‚Äôm not sure, but he drew either two intertwined ‚ÄòB‚Äô letters or the number ‚Äò8‚Äô inside that triangle. He placed a piece of paper from his pocket onto the table, which had different symbols or maybe writings on it. Mevl√ºt asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Berkan?‚Äù Having initially made fun of it, this time he was also tense. Berkan, without answering Mevl√ºt, said, ‚ÄúHold hands and close your eyes.‚Äù As if mesmerized, we did as he said.

When we closed our eyes, Berkan, I assume, started reading from that paper. He was saying things loudly and shouting in an incomprehensible language. He did it almost like screaming. He repeated what he was saying for about a minute. One of my hands held Mevl√ºt‚Äôs, the other held Mehmet‚Äôs. I could tell they were both scared and tense from their sweaty palms. They held on so tightly that I felt my hand hurt. Soon after, Berkan stopped. ‚ÄúSlowly open your eyes,‚Äù he said. I opened my eyes hesitantly. The candlelight seemed to flicker violently. ‚ÄúYou can let go of your hands,‚Äù Berkan said. Mevl√ºt swallowed first, then asked in a shaky voice, ‚ÄúWhat happened now?‚Äù Berkan said, ‚ÄúRight now, there is a jinn or jinn in the room. I don‚Äôt know how many, but don‚Äôt worry, they can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù Mevl√ºt asked, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just scaring us, aren‚Äôt you, man?‚Äù Berkan was about to answer when the TV, which was off, suddenly turned on.

We all reflexively turned to the TV. We couldn‚Äôt speak. The TV was showing that scene from the movie in the living room; the scene where the characters sat around the table just like us. We focused a bit more and realized it wasn‚Äôt the movie characters sitting at that table, but the four of us! I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. Mevl√ºt grabbed my arm and squeezed it so hard, crying out, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?!‚Äù None of us could answer that question, of course; none of us understood what was going on. As we stared at the screen like statues, a silhouette appeared behind the right shoulder of each of us on the TV screen; smoky silhouettes with red eyes. Instinctively, we started turning our eyes from the screen to our own shoulders; wondering if there was an entity like the one on the screen. The moment we turned our heads towards our own shoulders, we were struck dumb. Oh my God! There was a smoky entity right under my nose!

We all started screaming. We knocked over the table, the candles. We ran around the room like madmen. Berkan went and turned on the light. Those entities were gone. The candles had fallen over and even slightly burned the carpet. I yelled at Berkan, ‚ÄúWhat have you done, man?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI just did it for a little scare,‚Äù he said. Mevl√ºt, the most enthusiastic one among us, seemed to be in the worst state; sprawled on the floor, breathing heavily. We went to him, helped him up a bit, gave him water. ‚ÄúAre they gone? Are they gone?‚Äù he kept asking. We said, ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre safe.‚Äù Actually, we didn‚Äôt know if we were safe or not, but Mevl√ºt was in a bad state, so we lied to calm him down. We sat him on the couch and gave him a cigarette. ‚ÄúTurn on all the lights! Turn on all the lights!‚Äù he kept saying. Berkan went and turned on the lights in the hallway, kitchen, everywhere. He approached Mevl√ºt and asked, ‚ÄúAre you okay, brother?‚Äù Mevl√ºt didn‚Äôt answer at first, then stood up, ‚ÄúYou shameless bastard, asking me that! I‚Äôll spit in your mouth!‚Äù and pushed Berkan hard. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your deal, man?‚Äù he said, grabbing him by the collar and shaking him, ‚ÄúGet the hell out of this house!‚Äù Berkan looked at me. I also said, ‚ÄúGet out! Take your cup and candles and get out right now!‚Äù He did as I said, took his things, and left.

After Berkan left, Mevl√ºt was still cursing. I said, ‚ÄúYou asked for it, sorry.‚Äù Mevl√ºt retorted, ‚ÄúOh, so now it‚Äôs my fault, is that it?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs your fault! Why did you bring a guy you don‚Äôt even know into my house? And even if you did, you just agree to everything he says, ‚Äòokay, okay, let‚Äôs do it‚Äô. Is he a sorcerer, a Satanist, who knows what he is? Look what happened, we were about to lose our minds! I hope this is all there is to it,‚Äù I said. It was getting close to 11 PM. ‚ÄúI have work in two hours, how am I going to go like this now?‚Äù I asked. Mevl√ºt said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go together, it‚Äôs better if we don‚Äôt separate tonight anyway.‚Äù

At that moment, I felt so tired and exhausted that I said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to my room, I‚Äôm going to lie down for a bit.‚Äù I lay down on my bed. We opened the sofa bed in the room, and Mevl√ºt and Mehmet lay down there too. When I closed my eyes, I felt like drifting off. Immediately, our friends started talking among themselves, ‚ÄúDude, were we just so scared that we imagined seeing them?‚Äù I fell asleep to the sound of their whispers. Not much time passed before I woke up to a nearby sound. It was a sound like chopping wood. Our friends must have fallen asleep too, as all three of us woke up startled. As we opened our eyes, what did we see! Dozens of trees, like poplar trees, inside my room! These trees emerged from round holes that had formed in the ceiling and stretched towards the sky. My room looked like a forest. Sounds of wild animals and birds were coming. We had lain down with the lights on, but all the lights in the house were off! That wood-chopping sound was coming from the terrace accessible from my room.

All three of us sat up. There was a certain courage that came from feeling like I was in a dream because our situation was as utopian as a dream. Me in front, the others behind, we passed by the trees and headed towards the door leading to the terrace. Looking through the door, I saw two figures. Two strange men, about 1.60 meters tall, dressed in black, were cutting down the trees that had appeared on the terrace with axes in their hands. They didn‚Äôt see us at all, focused only on their work. We waited for a while, speechless. Then, holding onto each other, we silently left the room. We thought that if we made any noise, those men would notice us. When we got out of the house and stood in front of the main door, we stared at each other with wide eyes, as if asking, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

Soon after, Mevl√ºt said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going crazy! Are we dreaming or is this real? Somebody slap me!‚Äù Mehmet slapped him so hard that Mevl√ºt let out a cry. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs run, let‚Äôs get out of here!‚Äù he said. I said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been afflicted, this curse won‚Äôt leave us alone.‚Äù Mevl√ºt walked to the end of the apartment hallway and started banging his head against the wall. Mehmet and I went and got him.

Aunt Feride lived downstairs. Her husband had passed away a year ago; she lived alone. She liked me too. At that moment, the idea of asking the aunt for help came to my mind. We quickly rushed to her door, not caring how late it was. Aunt Feride opened the door sleepily. ‚ÄúNiyazi, son, what happened?‚Äù she asked. I said, ‚ÄúAuntie, we‚Äôre not okay. We were watching a horror movie with friends, I think we‚Äôve been afflicted by something. There are strange entities in the house.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh dear, son, come inside, come in. You must be scared, let me read something over you, you‚Äôll feel better,‚Äù she said. We went into Aunt Feride‚Äôs living room. The aunt said, ‚ÄúLet me perform ablution, I‚Äôll read some Quran for you,‚Äù and went inside. We looked at each other in shock and fear.

A little later, Aunt Feride came back with a book in her hand. She pulled up a chair and sat across from us. Then she started reading, reading very fast. About five minutes passed, and tears started streaming down my eyes. I felt a liquid flowing from my nose. When I touched my nose, I realized it was blood. While Aunt Feride continued reading, without disturbing her at all, I quietly got up and headed towards the bathroom. While in the hallway, I heard a coughing sound coming from the bedroom. ‚ÄúGood Lord, who could that be? Aunt Feride lives alone,‚Äù I thought. Then I heard someone‚Äôs voice from the bedroom again: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there? I called the police!‚Äù it shouted. It was Aunt Feride‚Äôs voice! My blood ran cold. From where I stood in the entrance area, I could see both the living room and the corridor leading to the bedroom. Keeping one eye on the corridor, I turned towards the living room and called out to Aunt Feride, who had her back to me and was facing my friends: ‚ÄúAunt Feride? Aunt Feride?‚Äù Without moving her body at all, she turned her head 180 degrees, said, ‚ÄúYes, my child?‚Äù and burst into laughter!

Mevl√ºt and Mehmet screamed at this sight and started running. They were cursing at the same time. They came towards me, and we scrambled out of that house. We leaped down the stairs three or five steps at a time and threw ourselves onto the street. We didn‚Äôt stop on the street either, continuing to run like madmen. At one point, our legs gave out, and we ran out of breath, so we stopped. Mehmet, gasping for air, said, ‚ÄúI knew she wasn‚Äôt reading the Quran, but since you didn‚Äôt say anything, I didn‚Äôt either.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt tell out of fear, brother, how would we know?‚Äù we said. Mevl√ºt added, ‚ÄúThere was an eye-like symbol on the book, but I swear I didn‚Äôt realize it either.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúMy shift is starting, let‚Äôs walk there. Let‚Äôs ask Mustafa abi, tell him. He‚Äôs a religious person, maybe he can find a cure for us.‚Äù Mustafa abi was an elder I worked with at the cold storage warehouse when our shifts coincided. I was scheduled to work with him that day too. The three of us went to my workplace around 1 AM. We took over the shift and started waiting. About five minutes later, Mustafa abi arrived. He had met Mevl√ºt and Mehmet before. As soon as he arrived, he asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, you look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost, what‚Äôs with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell abi, we did see a ghost,‚Äù we said. When he asked, ‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù Mevl√ºt interrupted before we could explain, ‚ÄúSay Bismillah first, abi.‚Äù He was trying to figure out if Mustafa abi was really Mustafa abi. Mustafa abi said Bismillah, read a prayer, and blew lightly. All three of us sighed in relief. ‚ÄúYou guys are really scared, tell me what happened,‚Äù he said.

So we told him everything that happened, but we were too embarrassed to mention the ritual Berkan performed with the cup. ‚ÄúWe were watching a horror movie, and this happened,‚Äù we said. Mustafa abi exclaimed, ‚ÄúGood heavens! Are you sure, brothers? Could it have been a dream or hallucination?‚Äù When we swore it wasn‚Äôt, he said, ‚ÄúWait a minute,‚Äù and grabbed his phone. After a 2-3 minute call, he said, ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù He called the colleagues we had just taken the shift from and said, ‚ÄúYou guys stay for another two hours, we‚Äôll sort it out another time.‚Äù Thankfully, they helped us out.

We got into Mustafa abi‚Äôs car and set off. ‚ÄúWhere are we going, abi?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see a hodja (religious scholar). He‚Äôs from our village but lives in Ankara. When I told him what you said, he immediately told me to bring you guys to him. God willing, he‚Äôll help. We‚Äôll solve this, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay Mustafa abi, Inshallah (God willing),‚Äù I said. We drove for about half an hour. We were heading towards a neighborhood with garden houses. The road and surroundings started to become deserted. About 300 meters ahead, we saw a large white mass. When Mevl√ºt nervously asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Mustafa abi chuckled slightly, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs a flock of sheep,‚Äù and slowed down the car. Mehmet remarked, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs 1:30 AM‚Ä¶‚Äù Hearing that, Mustafa abi also became uneasy. That flock of sheep completely surrounded our car. Even though we honked a couple of times, they absolutely wouldn‚Äôt clear the way. We were muttering, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the shepherd?‚Äù when all those sheep suddenly turned into pitch-black pigs! We couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes! Those pigs started grunting and hitting the car. Mustafa abi quickly pressed the car stereo button, and Quran recitation started playing from the stereo. He turned the volume all the way up. That herd of pigs scattered left and right in disarray. Mustafa abi, uttering prayers of repentance, pulled the car away sharply.

About 5 minutes later, we arrived at the hodja‚Äôs house. It was a small, modest house. The hodja was a short, gentle-looking man, around 60-65 years old. He immediately welcomed us and took the three of us into a room. Mustafa abi stayed outside. The hodja said, ‚ÄúI heard briefly from Mustafa on the phone. Now, tell me in detail.‚Äù We again explained without mentioning Berkan‚Äôs cup incident, but the hodja told us, ‚ÄúSomething is missing in this story.‚Äù We looked at each other. Mevl√ºt turned to me and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs tell him, it‚Äôs not our fault anyway.‚Äù We told him about Berkan and the cup incident. The hodja asked us, ‚ÄúWere there any symbols on the cup, or the candles, or on the table?‚Äù We described the symbol he drew on the cup as best as we could. The hodja exclaimed ‚ÄúOh dear, oh dear!‚Äù and asked, ‚ÄúWhere is the cup?‚Äù When we said Berkan took it, he urged, ‚ÄúGo get me that cup immediately, otherwise, nothing good will happen! Hurry!‚Äù

I asked Mevl√ºt, ‚ÄúDo you know Berkan‚Äôs address?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I do,‚Äù he said. We were about to leave immediately when the hodja said, ‚ÄúWait, I‚Äôm coming,‚Äù and left the room. About 15 minutes later, he returned with five amulets (muska) in his hand. The hodja gave three to us, one to Mustafa abi, and said, ‚ÄúWear these around your necks.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt provide protection for very long, so go quickly and bring that cup. Put this last amulet on your car‚Äôs rearview mirror. Go quickly!‚Äù he said.

We wasted no time and went to Berkan‚Äôs house. We knocked on the door, but no one answered. It was a basement apartment. We went around and knocked on Berkan‚Äôs room window. Mevl√ºt was especially tense. If it were daytime, he would have yelled, but since it was night, we didn‚Äôt want to wake the neighborhood. Mevl√ºt started banging harder on the window when Berkan appeared at the barred window. His eyes were bloodshot, his face contorted with fear. He opened the window and asked, ‚ÄúWhat? What happened? Why are you banging on my door in the middle of the night?‚Äù Mevl√ºt grabbed Berkan‚Äôs collar through the bars and pulled him closer. ‚ÄúIf we weren‚Äôt in a hurry, I‚Äôd kill you! Where‚Äôs the cup?‚Äù he demanded. Likely intimidated by Mevl√ºt‚Äôs aggression, Berkan stammered, ‚ÄúTrash‚Ä¶ I threw it in the trash.‚Äù Mevl√ºt yelled, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie, Berkan!‚Äù ‚ÄúI swear I threw it in the trash!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich trash? Where?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe trash container in front of Niyazi‚Äôs house!‚Äù Mevl√ºt pushed Berkan away forcefully. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll deal with you later!‚Äù he said.

We immediately started heading towards my house. When we entered my neighborhood, the garbage truck was already on our street. Two workers getting off the truck were heading towards the container where Berkan said he threw the cup. I yelled ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù to Mustafa abi and jumped out of the car. ‚ÄúSir! Sir!‚Äù I called out to the workers. ‚ÄúYes, brother?‚Äù they replied. ‚ÄúStop, sir, don‚Äôt empty the trash!‚Äù I said. My friends had run after me. Mevl√ºt told the workers, ‚ÄúSir, we accidentally threw something valuable in the trash, we‚Äôll find it in two minutes, sorry about that.‚Äù Thankfully, they said, ‚ÄúOkay, go ahead and look.‚Äù All of us, including Mustafa abi, started rummaging through the trash. Mehmet lamented, ‚ÄúLook what we‚Äôve gotten ourselves into!‚Äù After a few minutes, Mevl√ºt found the wooden cup. As soon as he picked it up, he felt dizzy, almost stumbled. Mustafa abi, reciting prayers, took the cup from Mevl√ºt. Mevl√ºt immediately recovered. The workers were looking at us in bewilderment. They were right, of course; we had caused quite a commotion for a single cup. We thanked the workers and headed back to the hodja‚Äôs house.

The hodja must have been worried about us, as he was waiting for us at the door. He asked anxiously, ‚ÄúDid you find it?‚Äù Mustafa abi handed the cup to the hodja. After examining it briefly, the hodja told the three of us, ‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù and took us back to that room. Three copper-like bowls were placed in front of the cushions where we sat. There were lit candles in the room. The hodja placed the cup upside down on a small mirror lying on the floor in front of him. He placed a pinch of herb on top of it. After swaying back and forth and praying for a few minutes, he lifted his head towards the ceiling and shouted something loudly. A smoky silhouette appeared behind the hodja‚Äôs shoulder. The hodja slowly turned his head towards his shoulder, towards the silhouette, and said something. Then he fell silent. After a few seconds, he spoke again, seemingly conversing with the silhouette. As he turned his head back towards us, the silhouette vanished.

The hodja told us, ‚ÄúFortunately, you only invited them.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo sacrifice was offered, nor was any pact made. Your friend you mentioned doesn‚Äôt seem to know much about these things, but he‚Äôs curious, of course. He tried to do things he learned here and there. Now, I will break this invitation, God willing,‚Äù he said. We nodded our heads as if saying, ‚ÄúOh, thank God!‚Äù The hodja recited the Quran from his throat, loudly, and very melodiously. Peace filled my heart. Then he paused for a bit. He quickly said something in a language I thought wasn‚Äôt Arabic and blew towards the cup and the herb on it. As soon as the hodja blew, first the herb, then the wooden cup started to burn! A few seconds later, pus from our stomachs gushed out of our mouths and noses! All three of us leaned over the copper bowls placed in front of us; we understood why they were put there. After getting permission from the hodja, we went to the bathroom to wash our faces and mouths.

The hodja told us, ‚ÄúWith Allah‚Äôs permission, they cannot bother you anymore after this.‚Äù We expressed our gratitude and kissed his hands. I didn‚Äôt go to work that day. Mustafa abi dropped us off at Mevl√ºt‚Äôs place and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sort out work, you rest today.‚Äù

For a while, my sleep was filled with nightmares. I became afraid of being alone in dark, enclosed spaces. I had witnessed things many times worse than in horror movies. But strengthening my faith, starting to pray regularly, and visiting the hodja frequently helped me overcome this situation. Whenever we had time, Mevl√ºt, Mehmet, and I visited the hodja. We helped him with gardening, chopped his wood, and took care of his garden as much as we could. His knowledge, kind heart, and advice helped us overcome the psychological shock we experienced more easily. May Allah grant long life to him and others like him who dedicate their lives to the benefit of humanity. Amin.

This feels a little personal to post, but I‚Äôve seen how open and thoughtful this community can be, so‚Ä¶ here goes.

I‚Äôm a gay man and a clinical hypnotist by profession‚Äîworking mostly with anxiety and trauma. Over time, I‚Äôve gotten really curious about the deeper connection between *language* and *arousal*. The way words, rhythm, and suggestion can *guide* a body just as much as a hand can.

That curiosity turned into a passion project: writing erotic stories that feel‚Ä¶ immersive. Gentle mind-play. Slow surrender. Sensory tension that builds and builds.

I‚Äôve kept it anonymous so far (licensing concerns), but I‚Äôd love to quietly share a story here if anyone‚Äôs interested. It‚Äôs written with care, intention, and a deep respect for the emotional and erotic depth of being gay. It's part of my gay experience. **It's only 6 paragraphs! :)**

except that instead of us holding a cocktail, mine would be a matcha latte, then after that maybe a spanish latte while also chewing on some banana bread while bopping my head to house or rnb music

**Where:** recommend a place in Metro Manila that has this. Preferences include: Makati, Mandaluyong, Manila, Pasay. San Juan is a *looong* shot.

**When:** ako na mag-aadjust dahil alam ko na mahirap ang hinahanap ko.

**Why:** jamming to music, dancing with a drink in hand sometimes feels close to a religion because it is a bunch of people absorbing everyone else's energy, having a good time. It's fun in the dark of night; hopefully it's just as enjoyable under the light of day.

**With who:** I typically fly solo, but strangers open to hanging out while drinking coffee is also cool.

**There is no place like this, what are you going to do about it?** Well, if you tell me there is no place like this‚Äîsometimes I make for an okay project manager or building up an event (or a community), so if you own a store you want to bring this idea to, I am happy to talk shop and maybe build it in 3 months?

But if there exists a place that has this, leads are welcome.

If you need a little reset without going full ‚Äúcleanse mode,‚Äù you might be thinking to try [**Traditional Medicinals Everyday Detox Lemon Tea**](https://amzn.to/41Q5Gl6).

Based on my first-hand experience with various detox and weight loss teas, I'd like to share my thoughts on Everyday Detox Lemon Tea. I've tried numerous teas marketed for weight loss and detox effects, and this one falls somewhere in the middle range.

**Rating: 3/5 stars**

**What I Appreciate:** If you're looking for a gentle, caffeine-free option, this tea is worth considering. Unlike some of the aggressive ""skinny teas"" that can have you running to the bathroom (like those Chinese slimming teas many users warn about), Traditional Medicinals takes a more moderate approach. I found the lemon flavor pleasant and not artificial.

**The Downsides:** If you're expecting dramatic weight loss results, you might be disappointed. From my experience, and comparing with feedback from other tea users, any weight loss effects are minimal at best. Like most detox teas, any initial weight loss is likely just water weight.

**Comparison with Other Brands:** Having tried various options, I'd say this is gentler than those intense Chinese slimming teas that many users report cause severe digestive issues.

However, it's not as satisfying as a good quality green tea or detoxing as other good dandelion brands from some reputable vendors [**like this brand**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) (my current top pick for weight management and detox) or Den's Tea or Harney & Sons, which offer better overall benefits.

**My Honest Take:** If you're interested in Everyday detox tea, here's what you should know:

- The dandelion root can have a mild diuretic effect, but gentler than some other ""detox"" teas
- It's more expensive than basic grocery store teas but cheaper than premium loose leaf options
- The lemon flavor helps mask some of the herbal bitterness
- Don't expect miracle results - it's best used as part of a balanced diet and exercise routine

**Safety Notes:** From my experience with various detox teas, I appreciate that this one doesn't contain harsh laxatives like senna, which can be found in many ""slimming"" teas. However, if you have a sensitive stomach, start with just one cup to see how your body reacts.

**Bottom Line:** I'd recommend this if you're looking for a gentle, caffeine-free evening tea that might help with bloating. However, if your primary goal is weight loss, you might be better off investing in quality green tea and focusing on diet and exercise.

Remember, as many experienced tea drinkers in the community note, there's no magic tea that will dramatically affect your weight - it's more about replacing high-calorie beverages, appetite and cravings control support and developing healthy habits.

Keep in mind that my experience is just one perspective - everyone's body reacts differently to these products. If you decide to try it, start slowly and listen to your body's response.

### What I currently recommend

Based on my extensive experience with various weight loss teas, I would highly recommend trying [**this tea brand**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) over Traditional Medicinals if you're serious about supporting your weight management goals.

This tea system really stands out because it's designed as a complete day-night solution - you get an energizing morning blend that contains metabolism-boosting ingredients like green tea, oolong, and garcinia cambogia (something Traditional Medicinals lacks), plus a gentle evening detox blend that helps with bloating and digestion.

What I particularly appreciate from my first-hand testing is that while Traditional Medicinals offers just basic herbal support, the former combines proven ingredients like green tea for metabolism, ginger for digestion, and monk fruit for natural sweetness without calories. If you struggle with late-night cravings, their evening blend has been especially helpful in my experience, offering benefits beyond just the basic detox effects of Traditional Medicinals.

I've found the dual-blend approach helps maintain consistent energy throughout the day while supporting better sleep at night - a crucial factor for weight management that the Traditional Medicinals blend doesn't address.

Unlike some harsh detox teas, this one provides a more balanced approach that you can sustainably incorporate into your daily routine.

Though I still maintain that no tea alone will cause dramatic weight loss, the comprehensive ingredient profile is a more practical choice for supporting your overall wellness and weight management goals.

## My final Performance Evaluation (Ratings)

### **Appetite Control: 3/5**

While not specifically designed to curb appetite, the tea can help reduce cravings and overeating by **promoting better digestion** and reducing bloating. Its warmth and soothing qualities may help you feel satiated between meals.

### **Energy Enhancement: 2.5/5**

Since it‚Äôs **caffeine-free**, this tea doesn‚Äôt provide a direct energy boost like coffee or green tea. However, its ability to improve liver function and digestion may result in a **subtle increase in energy levels** over time as toxins are flushed out and your body operates more efficiently.

### **Metabolism Boosting: 3/5**

Ingredients like **dandelion root** and **burdock root** may indirectly support metabolism by enhancing liver health and detoxification. While not a metabolism ‚Äúbooster‚Äù in the traditional sense, it creates an internal environment conducive to better metabolic function.

### **Fat Oxidation and Burning: 2/5**

This tea isn‚Äôt specifically formulated for fat burning, and there‚Äôs little evidence that its ingredients directly oxidize fat. However, by reducing bloating and improving digestion, it may support a feeling of lightness that helps motivate healthier habits.

### **Blood Sugar Regulation: 3/5**

**Dandelion root** and **stinging nettle** have been traditionally linked to better blood sugar control. While not a substitute for medical treatment, the tea may help balance blood sugar levels mildly by promoting improved digestion and reducing sugar cravings.

### **Cognitive Support and Mental Clarity: 2.5/5**

The tea‚Äôs natural detox benefits may support **mental clarity** over time as the body removes excess toxins. However, it doesn‚Äôt contain specific cognitive enhancers like adaptogens or nootropics, so its effect here is minimal.

### **Digestive and Gut Health: 4.5/5**

This is where the tea shines. **Dandelion root** acts as a natural liver and digestive tonic, while **burdock root** and **stinging nettle** help with bloating, water retention, and gut health. Many users report feeling less bloated and more regular after drinking it consistently.

### **Safety and Tolerability: 5/5**

The tea is **organic, caffeine-free**, and made with well-studied herbs that are generally safe for most people. It‚Äôs gentle on the stomach and has a very low risk of side effects when consumed in moderation.

### **Long-Term Effectiveness: 4/5**

For ongoing liver support, skin health, and detoxification, this tea works well when consumed regularly. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúquick fix,‚Äù but with long-term use, users tend to notice sustained improvements in digestion, bloating, and general wellness.

There‚Äôs a longer story here but to save your eyes holes and my fingers time, I‚Äôll give the short version. This gorgeous girl who I‚Äôve crushed on from a distance for a LONG time and I hooked up twice this weekend. I didn‚Äôt even know I existed on her radar. Turns out she had been eye balling me this whole time, and that night was the night we both had ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù moments and made our moves. 

We danced at a club on Friday night and she came home after and did adult activities. She stayed the night, we woke up and did more adult activities, drank coffee for a good while and had a really good conversation (like, really good). Then I took her back to get her car. I tried holding off on texting her bc I didn‚Äôt want to seem over eager and clingy (I‚Äôve been known to do that). But she left an earring so I texted her about it, and again one thing led to another and Sunday night she came back over. We talked more (this girl is a good conversationalist and hilarious), watched Anora, did adult activities, and I cooked her and I dinner before she left near midnight. So all in all, it seems like she‚Äôs really into me, even though she gives off the vibe of being a more casual dater. 

My experience is that I usually am not the casual dater. I tend to move fast and be the anxious attached person, wanting to put labels and structure on things, but thanks to therapy I‚Äôm a lot better about it. That said, the way we spent time together felt more romantic than pure ‚Äúhit it and quit it‚Äù. So I don‚Äôt want to romanticize but I‚Äôm hopeful. Either way I‚Äôm not sure when would be appropriate to text her again. She‚Äôs much more chatty in person (so she doesn‚Äôt seem the texting type), and the last exchange we had was last night with us both saying we had a good time and thanking each other for it. 

Because I‚Äôve been burned before and this all seems to too good be true, I‚Äôm overthinking when to reach out again. Should I give it some time? Would it be desperate or show healthy pursuit to text her again today and ask when I could see her again? Someone please bring me down to earth. ",3,1743433070.0,dating,3,1.0,False

The [full blog post](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulinresistance/) exceeds the allowed character limit on Reddit, so the sections on Aerobic Exercise, Strength Training, Sleep, and Medications were truncated from the Reddit post.

**Introduction**

Insulin resistance is arguably the most significant health abnormality affecting humankind. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of insulin resistance in adults, adolescents, and children highlights the growing threat that insulin resistance poses to individuals of all ages. While insulin resistance is typically associated with obesity,¬†**insulin resistance can also affect those with a normal body weight**.^(1-3)¬†To demonstrate this point, it is estimated that 16% of school-aged children with a normal body weight have insulin resistance.^(4)¬†While it is widely recognized that insulin resistance contributes to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance also contributes to a constellation of serious and disabling health abnormalities, including several types of cancer, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoarthritis, muscle loss, frailty, and infertility.^(5-12)¬†Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that insulin resistance is a stronger risk factor of cardiovascular disease than elevated levels of LDL-C and Apolipoprotein B ([Link](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance)).^(13)¬†Therefore, the early identification of insulin resistance is necessary for those seeking to promote longevity and avoid preventable medical illness.

Meanwhile, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the most commonly utilized test for assessing blood glucose control. However,¬†**HbA1c is not an optimal test for identifying insulin resistance**. Specifically, it is a measurement of long-term blood glucose control and lacks the sensitivity to detect early stages of insulin resistance in those with normal blood glucose control (Figure 1).^(14,15)¬†As a result, the standard approach to diagnosing insulin resistance using HbA1c often allows insulin resistance to go undiagnosed until significant health problems arise. Similarly, Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) measure blood glucose fluctuations but may miss insulin resistance among those who are able to maintain normal blood glucose control, despite elevated levels of circulating insulin. Therefore, an optimal strategy is to utilize superior tests that identify insulin resistance prior to the onset of blood glucose dysregulation. This includes the¬†[**LPIR Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance/#LPIR),¬†[**Triglyceride-Glucose Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)¬†([**TyG Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)), and¬†[**HOMA-IR**](https://kevinforeymd.com/HOMA-IR/).

Importantly,¬†**insulin resistance is reversible in many cases**, especially when addressed early with comprehensive lifestyle changes. Strategies to prevent insulin resistance are similar to the strategies used to reverse insulin resistance. This generally includes dietary modification, physical fitness, and the optimization of sleep and stress. In select instances, supplements and prescription medications can also be effective, however,¬†**optimizing food and nutrition and physical fitness is more effective than medications**¬†**alone**.^(16)¬†Meanwhile, multiple strategies can be utilized simultaneously to maximize the likelihood of success. While the restriction of saturated fat is commonly recommended for the sake of reducing LDL cholesterol, this has no appreciable impact on improving insulin resistance.^(17)¬†Therefore, we will explore evidence-based strategies capable of improving insulin resistance and other components of Metabolic Syndrome.

**Content Summary**

* **Insulin resistance is more than a risk factor of type 2 diabetes**. It is also a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease, infertility, osteoarthritis, and frailty.^(5-12)¬†Furthermore,¬†**insulin resistance can also affect those with a normal body weight**.^(1-3)
* **Hemoglobin A1c, CGM, and fasting glucose tests often fail to detect early stages of insulin resistance**, as the body can maintain normal blood glucose values despite insulin resistance.^(14,15)¬†**Elevated levels of insulin are toxic to the body**¬†and occur years or decades before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation and abnormalities in HbA1c and CGM.^(14,15)
* **The most effective tests for detecting insulin resistance early**¬†include include the¬†[Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance (LPIR) Score](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance/#LPIR),¬†[Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) Index](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/), and¬†[HOMA-IR](https://kevinforeymd.com/homa-ir/). For early stages of insulin resistance, these tests are more accurate and sensitive compared to HbA1c or CGM.^(18-30)
* Importantly,¬†**insulin resistance is reversible in many cases**, especially when addressed early with comprehensive lifestyle changes that optimize food, nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress. Supplements and medications are also effective, however, comprehensive lifestyle changes appear most effective.^(16)¬†Meanwhile, all strategies can be used simultaneously.
* **Optimizing food and nutrition appears to be the most powerful tool for improving insulin resistance**.^(38)¬†Meanwhile, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (Zone 2) may be as effective, or even more effective, than high-intensity aerobic exercise.^(38)¬†Although aerobic exercise appears more effective than strength training alone, the combined benefit of aerobic exercise and strength training appear greater than the individual benefits of each modality alone.^(38)¬†Therefore,¬†**it is advisable to prioritize the combination of food and nutrition, aerobic exercise, and strength training, for the prevention and reversal of insulin resistance**.
* The¬†**Toxic Food Hypothesis**¬†proposes that¬†**highly processed foods disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance**¬†through two primary mechanisms. (1)¬†**Overconsumption**: excess calorie intake compared to whole foods;^(42)¬†and (2)¬†**Metabolic Dysfunction**: even at equal caloric intake, highly processed foods uniquely damage metabolic health.^(43)
* Rather than mainstream nutritional guidelines to¬†*‚Äúmaintain a healthy energy balance‚Äù*¬†and to¬†*‚Äúeat everything in moderation,‚Äù*¬†a more effective approach to the prevention and reversal of insulin resistance is to¬†**minimize or eliminate the regular consumption of highly processed foods**, including simple sugars and flour-based food products.
* **Improving the**¬†**quality**¬†**of carbohydrates consumed is likely more important than simply reducing the**¬†**quantity**¬†**of carbohydrates consumed**. Replacing simple sugars alone with complex carbohydrates results in appreciable reductions in body weight, insulin resistance, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, independent of calorie intake.^(43)
* **Reducing carbohydrate intake can raise ApoB levels**. To mitigate potential ApoB increases, strategies include increasing soluble and insoluble fiber intake, avoiding saturated fat intake from highly processed foods and industrially raised livestock, cooking with avocado oil instead of butter or coconut oil, and considering select plant-based meat alternative products.
* **Time-restricted eating may also improve insulin resistance independently of calorie reduction**, especially when meals are consumed earlier in the day to align with circadian rhythms.^(62,63)¬†Importantly, the evidence remains mixed and more research is needed to confirm whether or not there are unique benefits of time-restricted eating over calorie restriction.^(64,65)
* **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) offer**¬†instant, visual feedback, that can help to influence positive lifestyle changes, especially in those¬†**with**¬†insulin resistance. Meanwhile, in individuals¬†**without**¬†insulin resistance, the role of CGMs remains less clear due to the lack of reproducibility and consistency in CGM reported glucose values.^(66)
* **Optimizing sleep and managing stress are critical**¬†for improving insulin sensitivity. Even modest sleep deprivation or sleep fragmentation can significantly impair insulin action. Sleep quality, quantity, and timing are all important considerations regarding insulin resistance.^(87-94)
* **Medications and supplements such as Metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and berberine**¬†can be helpful adjuncts in treating insulin resistance, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Each has a distinct mechanism of action and set of side effects.

**What Is Insulin Resistance**

Insulin resistance is an abnormal health condition in which the body fails to effectively respond to the hormone insulin. Under normal circumstances, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream to regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin achieves blood glucose control by facilitating glucose uptake into liver, muscle, and fat tissue. It also plays a foundational role in directing fat storage and protein synthesis. The amount of insulin released by the pancreas is influenced by several factors, including the type of food consumed, the amount consumed, recent physical activity, stress levels, inflammation, pre-existing metabolic health, and other hormonal considerations.

In the case of insulin resistance, the body becomes less effective in its ability to respond to the hormone insulin. As a result, the body will compensate by releasing increased amounts of insulin into the circulation, a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. Importantly,¬†**hyperinsulinemia can occur before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation or elevations in blood glucose levels**, implying that insulin resistance can exist before the onset of abnormalities seen in HbA1c or CGM.^(14,15)¬†Meanwhile, even with normal blood glucose control, it is recognized that¬†**elevated levels of insulin contribute to**¬†**a toxic health environment, resulting in chronic inflammation, organ damage, and cellular dysfunction**. More specifically, while insulin resistance is widely recognized to contribute to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and dementia.^(5,6,31,32)¬†Insulin resistance also contributes to liver disease, kidney disease, and the increasing need for dialysis and organ transplantation.^(7,8)¬†Furthermore, insulin resistance is also associated with several disabling conditions, including osteoarthritis, muscle loss, frailty, and infertility (Table 2).^(9-12)¬†Collectively, the United States spends more money treating the abnormalities of type 2 diabetes than any other health condition, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.^(33)

Beyond insulin resistance is a broader health abnormality known as Metabolic Syndrome, which often manifests as some combination of excess abdominal obesity (visceral adiposity), high blood pressure (hypertension), elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and inflammation. It is estimated that 85% of adults have at least one component of Metabolic Syndrome, with insulin resistance being the primary, underlying health abnormality of this broader condition.^(34)¬†While many health experts and public health guidelines focus on body weight, often measured by Body Mass Index (BMI), and the restriction of calorie intake to improve body weight, Metabolic Syndrome is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than BMI alone (Table 2).^(13)¬†Meanwhile, Metabolic Syndrome captures additional risk associated with poor metabolic health to a far greater degree than body weight or BMI alone. Therefore, it is advisable to view comprehensive metabolic health from the standpoint of Metabolic Syndrome, insulin resistance, and its relationship to abnormal lipoprotein (cholesterol) concentrations, rather than body weight and obesity alone. Once again, you do not have to be overweight to have insulin resistance or other abnormalities of Metabolic Syndrome.^(4)

**Early and Accurate Identification of Insulin Resistance**

Because insulin resistance can exist before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation, traditional blood tests such as fasting glucose levels and HbA1c often fail to detect insulin resistance in its early stages.^(14,15)¬†As a result, insulin resistance may exist for years or decades before abnormalities in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, or CGMs are observed.¬†

Furthermore,¬†[**HbA1c can also be elevated in healthy individuals without insulin resistance**](https://kevinforeymd.com/hemoglobina1c/). Perhaps the most common circumstance in which a healthy individual may have an elevated HbA1c includes endurance athletes who are observed to have higher fasting glucose levels, likely due to the body‚Äôs regular demand for circulating blood glucose during times of prolonged physical activity, resulting in upregulated gluconeogenesis (increased production of glucose in the liver and kidneys).^(35)¬†Other potential factors include those with a prolonged red blood cell lifespan, iron deficiency, and certain medications.¬†

These examples of the limitations of HbA1c underscore the importance of utilizing tests that more directly assess insulin resistance compared to Hemoglobin A1c. Rather than utilizing a single biomarker alone, a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of insulin resistance should utilize the combination of the LPIR Score, TyG Index, HOMA-IR, and other assessments of metabolic health (Table 3).

* [**Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance#LPIR)¬†([**LPIR Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance#LPIR)): A useful blood test that analyzes changes in lipoprotein particle size and concentration to determine the presence and severity of insulin resistance. It is particularly helpful in detecting early stages of insulin resistance, including those with a normal body weight and normal blood glucose control.^(18,19)¬†Notably, the LPIR Score was developed and validated using data from the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, which is the most precise method for measuring insulin resistance (‚Äúthe gold standard‚Äù). Because the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp is labor-intensive, it is only used in research settings and not available as a routine laboratory test. Instead, the LPIR Score bridges this gap by providing a simple blood test that is a highly reliable surrogate marker of insulin resistance, and calibrated to the gold standard for measuring insulin resistance.
* [**Triglyceride-Glucose Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)¬†([**TyG Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)): This index is calculated using a formula that combines fasting triglyceride and fasting glucose levels, making it both cost-effective, accessible, and another useful test for detecting insulin resistance.^(20)¬†Research has demonstrated the TyG Index to be a superior predictor of insulin resistance compared to HbA1c and HOMA-IR.^(20)¬†Beyond insulin resistance,¬†**the TyG Index is strongly associated with lifespan (all-cause mortality), frailty, multiple types of cancer including breast and colon cancer, and dementia**.^(21-27)
* [**HOMA-IR**](https://kevinforeymd.com/HOMA-IR/): Another widely used test that utilizes fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. While HOMA-IR is highly sensitive, it is also susceptible to large day-to-day fluctuations in fasting insulin and glucose levels that may be influenced by factors unrelated to insulin resistance.^(28-30)¬†Therefore, HOMA-IR should be interpreted in conjunction with other testing strategies to provide a comprehensive analysis of insulin resistance.
* **Hemoglobin A1c**¬†(**HbA1c**): A measurement of long-term blood glucose control, not insulin resistance.¬† While there is a strong degree of correlation between blood glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance, the use of¬†**HbA1c is best for monitoring long-term blood glucose control in those with advanced states of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes**. Meanwhile, it appears less helpful for detecting early stages of insulin resistance.¬†

**Strategies to Prevent and Reverse Insulin Resistance**

There are a variety of effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance. This includes dietary modification, physical fitness, optimization of sleep, stress management, and in some instances, supplements and prescription medications. The same strategies used to reverse insulin resistance are typically effective for the prevention of insulin resistance. However, among those who are metabolically healthy and without evidence of insulin resistance, there is more leniency in the degree of adherence to these strategies necessary to prevent insulin resistance. Meanwhile, for those with insulin resistance, poor metabolic health, and/or a family history of insulin resistance, it is reasonable to implement as many of these strategies as possible. Additionally, it is advantageous to remain as disciplined as possible in following these strategies. Meanwhile, all individuals will respond differently to these interventions, and professional guidance from a licensed healthcare professional is necessary for ensuring safety.¬†

**Food, Nutrition, and Physical Fitness**

When evaluating the relative effectiveness of aerobic exercise, strength training, and dietary modification, all are effective strategies for reversing and preventing insulin resistance. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that¬†**dietary modification is the single most impactful strategy for reversing insulin resistance**¬†(Figure 2).^(38)¬†Meanwhile,¬†**moderate-intensity aerobic exercise appears to be equally as effective, or more effective, than vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise**. Both¬†**moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise appear more effective than strength training in isolation**. Interestingly, the combination of aerobic exercise and strength training demonstrates a positive synergistic effect, for which¬†**the combined benefit of aerobic exercise and strength training appear greater than the individual benefits of each modality**. Importantly, the greatest benefits in overcoming insulin resistance are achieved with the combination of maximizing and optimizing food and nutrition, aerobic exercise, and strength training.¬†

**Figure 2. Impact of Aerobic Exercise, Strength Training, and Dietary Modification on Insulin Sensitivity**^(38)

Note: The unit kcal/kg of body weight/week (KKW) is a measure of the prescribed amount of exercise in terms of energy expenditure relative to body weight over a one-week period.

**Optimizing Food and Nutrition**

Food and nutrition likely represents the most important modifiable risk factor regarding insulin resistance and the array of health abnormalities associated with Metabolic Syndrome. Meanwhile, the subject of food and nutrition is highly controversial, with conflicting perspectives and nutritional priorities. While some health experts take a cautious approach, offering broad, non-controversial recommendations, such as maintaining a healthy energy balance, follow a Mediterranean diet, and prioritize physical activity, a more precise and scientific approach is required to fully address the complexities of metabolic health and insulin resistance.

**The Toxic Food Hypothesis**

Over the past century, rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and Metabolic Syndrome have risen dramatically, largely due to fundamental changes in the food system.^(39,40)¬†The transition from naturally occurring whole foods to a diet dominated by highly processed products now accounts for nearly 60% of total calorie intake in the United States.^(41)¬†Despite growing evidence linking highly processed foods to poor metabolic health, mainstream nutrition guidelines continue to emphasize a ‚Äúbalanced diet‚Äù without adequately addressing the unique harms of these foods. The common recommendation to ‚Äú*eat everything in moderation*‚Äù fails to acknowledge that some foods are inherently detrimental to human health. Rather than moderation, a more effective approach is to¬†**minimize or eliminate the regular consumption of highly processed foods**.

The¬†**Toxic Food Hypothesis**¬†proposes that highly processed foods disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Overconsumption**: Processed foods promote excessive calorie intake compared to whole foods.^(42)
2. **Metabolic Dysfunction**: Even at equal caloric intake, highly processed foods uniquely damage metabolic health.^(43)

The Toxic Food Hypothesis challenges the conventional calorie-centric model, emphasizing that food quality, not just quantity, is critical for metabolic health. Addressing insulin resistance requires more than simply adding healthier foods, it necessitates a fundamental shift away from highly processed foods.

**Defining Highly Processed Foods**

A common critique of the Toxic Food Hypothesis is the difficulty of defining ‚Äú*highly processed foods.*‚Äù While classification systems like NOVA‚Äôs ‚Äúultra-processed foods‚Äù exist, there are several notable limitations and shortcomings. Given the vast diversity and complexity of the modern food supply, rigid definitions are impractical. A typical grocery store carries more than 30,000 food products, for example.¬† Instead, a more useful approach is to consider processed foods qualitatively along a spectrum:

**Naturally Occurring ‚Üí Minimally Processed ‚Üí Highly Processed ‚Üí Ultra-Processed**

For this discussion,¬†**highly processed foods refer to products that cannot be made at home using simple ingredients and basic food preparation techniques**. Importantly, cooking is not the same as industrial food processing. Unlike household food preparation techniques (e.g., chopping vegetables, heating food, grinding peanuts to make peanut butter), industrial food processing involves chemical modifications and additives that fundamentally alter food composition. While not all processed foods are harmful, many contribute to poor metabolic health.

**Strategies for Optimizing Food and Nutrition**:

1. **Minimize or Eliminate Added and Refined Sugars**: A deliberate avoidance of highly processed foods, including highly processed sugars and carbohydrates, likely represents the greatest health opportunity for the majority of individuals with insulin resistance. To optimize health, individuals should aim to reduce or avoid added sugars found in sweets, candy, sodas, energy drinks, flavored coffee drinks, and sugar-containing condiments. Sugars contained in fruit juices should also be avoided, even if ‚Äúall natural‚Äù or ‚Äúorganic.‚Äù Additionally, highly refined carbohydrates containing sugar should be avoided, including pastries, muffins, breakfast cereals, and many processed snack-foods. Among those with insulin resistance, restricting added and refined sugar to less than 15 grams per day is a reasonable goal.¬†
2. **Improve Carbohydrate Quality**:¬†Significant health improvements can be made by focusing on the quality of the calories we consume. Research has shown that simply replacing high-fructose corn syrup with an equal amount of calories from starch-based carbohydrates can lead to noticeable improvements in insulin resistance, blood pressure, body weight, inflammation, and LDL cholesterol (Figure 3).^(43)¬†These benefits were observed within just two weeks, without any reduction in total calorie or carbohydrate intake. Instead, the key change was a deliberate shift toward higher-quality carbohydrates and the elimination of added and refined sugars.  Practical Examples to Improve Carbohydrate Quality:
   * Replace¬†**soda**¬†**‚Üí flavored sparkling water**.
   * Replace¬†**pasta**,¬†**sandwiches**, and¬†**grains**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**salad**;¬†**eat more salad**!
   * Replace¬†**french fries**¬†and¬†**onion rings**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**saut√©ed**¬†or¬†**grilled vegetables**.
   * Replace¬†**white rice**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**riced cauliflower**,¬†**whole grains**, or¬†**legumes**.
   * Replace¬†**chips**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**mixed nuts**,¬†**carrots and almond butter**, or¬†**sliced peppers and hummus**.
   * Replace¬†**granola**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**mixed nuts with cinnamon**.
   * Replace a¬†**sugar-containing dessert**¬†**‚Üí**¬†**mixed fruit**. Note: Be mindful of the sugar content in common fruits; those with insulin resistance should preferentially select fruits with low sugar content (Table 5).^(44)

**Figure 3. Stepwise Approach to Improving Carbohydrate Quality**

1. **Advanced Analysis of Carbohydrate Quality**: To better understand carbohydrate quality, several advanced nutritional metrics can offer valuable insight. Key among these are the¬†**Insulin Index**¬†and¬†**Glycemic Load**¬†(not the Glycemic Index), both of which are particularly useful in assessing food choices for individuals with insulin resistance (Table 4). Choosing foods that are low in both Glycemic Load and Insulin Index can lead to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity.¬†^(45-48)¬†In addition, other useful metrics include the¬†**Percent Fiber of Total Carbohydrate**¬†and the¬†**Protein-to-Carbohydrate Ratio**¬†(Table 4). While daily monitoring of these metrics is not necessary, they serve as useful reference points to scientifically evaluate food choices, illustrating a clear pattern from naturally occurring to highly processed foods, as shown in Table 4.  While the¬†**Glycemic Index**¬†is widely understood and commonly used, it is less reliable for daily dietary decisions. Research suggests that alternative methods like Glycemic Load offer more consistent outcomes regarding the improvement of insulin resistance.^(49)

Note: This article is not meant to demonize fruit. However, clinical research has demonstrated that increasing fruit intake, without making other dietary changes, can worsen insulin resistance, blood sugar control, and liver inflammation, in individuals with poor metabolic health at baseline.^(44)

1. **Reduce Total Carbohydrate Intake**: In addition to improving the quality of carbohydrates consumed, reducing total carbohydrate intake is often necessary for individuals with advanced insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. Well-designed clinical trials have shown that carbohydrate restriction is an effective strategy for improving insulin resistance.^(50-54)¬†Because highly processed foods are disproportionately composed of highly refined carbohydrates, most studies evaluating ‚ÄúCarbohydrate Restriction‚Äù or ‚ÄúLow-Carbohydrate Diets‚Äù are indirectly evaluating the impact of restricting highly processed foods.  Although reducing saturated fat is commonly recommended for lowering ApoB and LDL-C levels, it does not meaningfully improve insulin resistance.^(17)¬†In randomized clinical trials, Carbohydrate Restriction and the Mediterranean Diet often outperform Low-Fat Diets.^(50,55)¬†When compared directly, Carbohydrate Restriction may be equal to or even more effective than the Mediterranean Diet.^(50,56-58)¬†Importantly, the Mediterranean Diet shares several key components with many forms of Carbohydrate Restricted Diets, including (1) increased intake of dietary fats from natural sources like mixed nuts and olive oil, (2) reduced consumption of highly refined carbohydrates, and (3) greater focus on whole grains and legumes.  How closely an individual adheres to carbohydrate restriction depends on their unique circumstances and healthcare goals. For those with insulin resistance, it is important to discuss with a licensed healthcare professional to determine safe and appropriate targets. A common strategy is to reduce total carbohydrate intake by about 20-30%. For context, the average American adult consumes at least 240 grams of carbohydrates per day, with adult males averaging 260 to 300 grams per day.^(59-60)¬†Additionally, the intake of added and refined sugars should be limited to less than 10 to 15 grams per day. Research by Christopher Gardner, Ph.D., and colleagues has shown that significant improvements in insulin resistance can be achieved with a total carbohydrate intake of less than 140 grams per day, with additional benefits from further restriction (Table 6).^(61)¬†However, the quality of carbohydrates remains the most important factor, with a focus on minimizing or eliminating added sugars, refined sugars, and highly processed carbohydrate-rich foods.  This article is not intended to advocate for a single approach, but rather, to emphasize the importance of avoiding highly processed foods, especially added and refined carbohydrates, which disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance.

**Table 6. Impact of Carbohydrate Intake on Biomarkers of Insulin Resistance in the A to Z Trial\*\*\*\*****^(61)**

https://preview.redd.it/ax5sege9i1se1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=abba0da5b1149e996a6d7a3dc4c1624514da20b4

1. **Consider Time-Restricted Eating**:¬†Both calorie restriction and time-restricted eating can improve insulin resistance, but emerging evidence suggests that time-restricted eating may offer distinct advantages. Some studies have demonstrated that time-restricted eating alone can result in an improvement in insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function, and metabolic health, even without a reduction in calorie intake.^(62)¬†Other clinical trials have achieved improvements in metabolic health utilizing time restricted eating, particularly when meals are consumed earlier in the day, aligning with circadian rhythms.^(63)¬†Importantly, the evidence remains mixed and more research is needed to confirm whether or not there are unique benefits of time-restricted eating over calorie restriction.^(64,65)  In theory, at a cellular level, a prolonged duration of fasting will promote greater improvements and recovery of insulin resistance when no calories are being consumed and no insulin is being secreted. In contrast, caloric restriction continues to stimulate insulin secretion, even when calorie intake is reduced. Therefore, as we await additional scientific research, it remains plausible that time-restricted eating may offer unique benefits for the sake of improving insulin resistance. Meanwhile, caloric restriction and time-restricted eating are both effective strategies for improving insulin resistance.
2. **Track Glucose Levels Continuously**: Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) provide real-time feedback regarding glucose fluctuations in response to food intake, physical activity, stress, sleep, and medications. By offering instant, visual feedback, CGMs provide personalized data that can help to influence positive lifestyle changes. For example, if a particular food causes a glucose spike, choosing an alternative food or reducing the portion size may help to improve insulin resistance. This is particularly helpful and relevant to those¬†**with**¬†insulin resistance, where real-time, day-to-day feedback of food choices and the resultant blood glucose control can help to inform and modify daily decision making.¬†  Meanwhile, in individuals¬†**without**¬†insulin resistance, the role of CGMs remains less clear due to the lack of reproducibility and consistency in CGM reported blood glucose values.^(66)¬†Furthermore, glucose spikes to 140 to 150 mg/dL are normal and should not necessarily cause alarm and anxiety. Recent scientific research has acknowledged the reality that CGMs can overestimate the prandial glucose response when compared to capillary finger sampling.^(67)¬†Given that lack of clear thresholds, issues with reproducibility, and issues with accuracy, CGMs should not be used to diagnose insulin resistance, but should instead provide insight into those with blood glucose dysregulation and the need to further evaluate the possibility of insulin resistance.

**Balancing ApoB, Insulin Resistance, and Individual Circumstances**

Reductions in carbohydrate intake often leads to an increased consumption of dietary fats, including saturated fats. While the degree of carbohydrate processing significantly influences health, the same applies to dietary fats, where the source and composition matter. Importantly, higher saturated fat intake can elevate ApoB levels,^(68)¬†however, this effect varies considerably^(69)¬†depending on the type and quality of saturated fat consumed,^(70)¬†as well as individual biological and genetic factors. Given these complexities, individuals making dietary changes should monitor blood work, including ApoB, to assess their individual response. For those looking to optimize ApoB levels or mitigate potential increases associated with carbohydrate restriction, several dietary strategies can be considered:

1. **Increase Fiber Intake:**¬†Increasing fiber intake, particularly¬†**soluble fiber**, is an effective strategy for lowering LDL-C and ApoB. Soluble fiber found in foods such as psyllium, oats, barley, beans, and lentils, binds to bile acids and cholesterol, reducing absorption and increasing excretion, which in turn leads to greater LDL-C clearance and reduced ApoB levels. Clinical studies suggest that consuming 10 grams of soluble fiber per day can lower LDL-C by approximately 10 mg/dL.^(71,72)¬†**Insoluble fiber**, found in wheat bran, whole grains, nuts, and vegetables, has also been shown to lower LDL-C and ApoB by increasing fecal bulk and reducing intestinal transit time. While its effects on ApoB are less pronounced than those of soluble fiber, it is another strategy for lowering ApoB.^(73,74)
2. **Limit Consumption of Saturated Fat From Highly Processed Foods**: Saturated fats from highly processed foods can raise ApoB levels. These include processed meats, processed cheese products (e.g., American cheese, cheese spreads), many ready-to-eat and frozen meals, packaged snacks, certain baked goods, and fast food restaurants. Reducing intake of industrially manufactured and processed foods is a reasonable strategy for optimizing saturated fat intake and ApoB levels.¬†
3. **Replace Butter and Coconut Oil with Avocado Oil**: When cooking, replacing butter or coconut oil with avocado oil reduces saturated fat intake while avoiding reliance on highly processed oils like canola or soybean oil. Avocado oil is predominantly composed of monounsaturated fats, which are associated with favorable lipid profiles and remains stable at high cooking temperatures.¬†
4. **Limit Consumption of Industrial Raised Livestock**: Industrial-raised, grain-fed livestock have a less favorable fatty acid profile than grass-fed livestock. Grass-fed beef and dairy, for example, contain 2‚Äì5 times higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, a higher proportion of stearic acid (which has a neutral effect on LDL-C and ApoB), and greater levels of antioxidants compared to grain-fed livestock.^(75,76)¬†Preferentially selecting high-quality, naturally raised animal products is another approach to improving the quality and composition of dietary fat consumed.
5. **Consider Select Plant-Based Meat Alternative Products**: Some plant-based meat alternatives, such as tofu and tempeh, are minimally processed and provide beneficial metabolic effects. However, newer plant-based substitutes vary widely in ingredient quality and processing methods. While some use whole-food ingredients and natural seasonings, others contain industrially processed components similar to traditional processed foods. Some studies suggest that plant-based meat alternatives may contribute to favorable metabolic health outcomes, including improvements in insulin resistance and reductions in LDL-C.^(77,78)¬†However, not all studies have demonstrated improvements in LDL-C,^(79)¬†and the impact on ApoB remains less well studied. When incorporating these products, selecting options with minimal additives and a whole-food-based ingredient list is preferable.¬†

I head down EG every weekday morning to drop my son off at daycare, and 100% of the time, without fail, there are cars running the red light turning left into the auto mall. 

Is there a high pitched sound emitted at that intersection that only assholes can hear, telling them ‚ÄúDO IT, run the red‚Äù?? 

Just this morning there was an idiot who entered the intersection on a yellow and exited on a red. Which I mean, whatever, it happens all the time. I‚Äôm vigilant. BUT THEN, a few *seconds* after that red runner completed their turn, there was a SECOND dumbass that *entered* the intersection on a red, while myself and two other cars heading straight were already in it! Which is so unbelievably dangerous!! 

Anyway, if you intentionally run red lights I pray that the flip side of your pillow is never cold, your coffee is always the wrong temp, and that when you inevitably cause an accident you are the only one hurt.  ",7,1743432941.0,ElkGrove,9,0.77,False

I have very mild Crohn's (clearly, as my problem is keeping weight OFF rather than having trouble keeping it on - I seem to absorb my food pretty well, except I need to supplement for B12). I've recently had a full check-up and samples etc taken, and the specialist is deciding whether to recommend medication, which I've not needed before. (I am aware I am very fortunate in this case).

However a lot of healthy eating ideas seem to have fairly rapid digestive consequences, e.g. increasing fibre, increasing brassicas especially. Apparently a low Fodmap diet is a good idea but I am lost at the thought of cooking without onions and garlic. I just had to drink 1L of water for an ultrasound and I tried a different brand of squash, and the artificial sweetener in that triggered a bout of unpleasantness. I can't have coffee with syrup etc because of the sweeteners either. So, mild problems, but frustratingly it's sometimes the ""healthy choice"" which catches me out.

Does anyone here have experience with this, and any general tips or rules of thumb they would be willing to share?",1,1743432657.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

Is it possible?,"Wow I can't believe l'm writing this but tbh I have no one to say this to. I mean if I ever say it out loud I would be judged hard. I've tried to say it to my mom and my partner and oh god they told me not to say it again. But in reality I absolutely HATE been a mom. I love my baby, she is so sweet and adorable. A really good baby so far (she is 8months). I just miss my life and my freedom. I miss going out whenever I wanted, grabbing coffee or shopping, or even showering without her chasing me around and screaming most of the time. I can't even take a sht in peace.
I can't plan on doing anything fun cause I would have to find a sitter for her. Oh and the not sleep is the worse. It changes my mood. I used to be such a happy bright and smiley person. Now I'm mostly angry all the time, regretting been a mom. And don't even make me start on how my relationship dinamic has changed. (So far I have a great partner but still IT ISNT THE SAME) I would never let anything bad happen to her. But if my partner and I ever separated I would give him custody.
I know I would not be happy or capable of raising her alone. And even if I could I just don't want to do all the work alone. How is it far for only women to have to keep the kids?! Honestly ridiculous. I also feel like my mood swings are up and down A LOT. Idk if it's the hormones fro v having her 8 months ago or what. A lot of tin. get angry super easily at my partner and say really mean things. I can go from 0 to 100. I also have 0 sexual cravings. None. No idea why.
Before that(even when I was pregnant I would be sexually active). Now I just feel ew about it.
I don't get why women don't tell you how horrible been a mom actually is. NOW that I have a baby some other mom have say bad things about motherhood but not before! Like why won't they warn us??! I hate women now for that too. If I even got pregnant again I would not have it. Period. Idc how bad it sounds. I truly don't.
Becoming a mom is the biggest mistake of my life. And this short paragraph isn't even half of the bs I'm going through. And if other women ask me I would be try honest and tell them is horrible, I hope I don't get judge but if they the truth I'll give it to them.


**This was my original post at a different subreddit, then a mommy suggested I might have postpartum depression. Which made me wonder if I do? 
I‚Äôm not crying or sad, I‚Äôm just angry and annoyed I ever had a baby, I miss Me, my freedom, my old life. I‚Äôm miserable everyday (not all day but a big part of it) 
Sometimes I think about leaving my partner and the baby and start a new life.
Is this normal?? 

I do not want to take medication for this so I don‚Äôt see how just talking to a therapist might help???

Any advice or anecdotes I can relate to??

1jo50en,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jo50en/need_help_how_to_fix_this_29m_33f/,Need Help How to Fix This (29M) (33F),"This is not me. I‚Äôve never acted like that before and I know she knows that but is unable to see past it right now. I fucked up. There‚Äôs no doubt. But how do I fix this? I‚Äôm trying to chip away bit by bit but it feels like I‚Äôm getting nowhere.

Me and my girlfriend‚Äîtogether three and a half years‚Äî living together - hit a wall this week in Mexico. Wednesday started great‚Äîan hour before it blew up, we were talking engagement, kids, our future‚Äîfelt solid. Then midday, I was drinking more. At a bar, paying the bill with her sister‚Äôs fianc√©‚Äîfuture brother-in-law‚Äîhe told me something private about their sex life. He shouldn‚Äôt have, but I took it and later, in line outside a restaurant, made a rude joke about it to her sister‚Äîmade her really uncomfortable. She stormed off, came back five minutes later, yelled at me in the street‚Äîshe had every right. I apologized three times. Still in line, my girlfriend made a comment about our sex life‚Äîapologized later on the balcony, but it set me off. I said offside stuff like ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre staying at my family‚Äôs place‚Äô and ‚ÄòYou three should be on a flight tomorrow‚Äô‚Äîuncalled for. I left the line, went to another bar alone, kept drinking‚Äîno one ended up at dinner. Her fianc√© came to talk‚ÄîI was drunk, told him about a personal health issue of hers affecting our sex life, explaining why her comment triggered me. Felt I could share‚Äîdidn‚Äôt see it wrong then. Her sister had run upstairs crying before that, called their mom saying we disrespected her. Then came down to the bar, said my girlfriend was missing‚Äîno context. Didn‚Äôt know ‚Äòtil later she was calling her mom, trying to explain for me. It escalated‚Äîmy girlfriend came back; they were in the pool. Sister kept bugging about her bathing suit top‚Äîpetty to me with bigger issues. I kept escalating‚Äîwent down, they were gone getting everyone food for a while. I lay in bed; they returned, assumed I was asleep, closed my door. I was being immature‚Äîread the door closing as more than it was‚Äîwent upstairs to the pool alone, causing drama. Girlfriend came up‚Äîstill stubborn, pissed her off, she went down. Her sister got my dad from another condo, asked to switch rooms‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt comfortable with me. He said no, he‚Äôd talk to me first, came up, asked what‚Äôs going on. I didn‚Äôt know how he knew‚Äîadded to my anger.

Went back down, confronted them‚Äîhostile, unresolved. Sister and I agreed to be good, tomorrow‚Äôs new‚Äîstill mad, said it. Needed to finish the fight with my girlfriend on the balcony‚Äîjust yelling, mostly me, grasping at straws, no control over my anger, saying stuff I shouldn‚Äôt have, no defusing. Her sister packed their stuff, took her away. Thursday morning, hotel talk‚Äîthought it was good, said ‚ÄòI love you,‚Äô hugged, teared up, agreed no rash decisions, talk at home. I left; she stayed with her sister. Thursday afternoon, texted‚Äîsaid I‚Äôm sorry, we‚Äôre stronger, I love her‚Äîshe texted back, said she‚Äôs sad, ‚ÄòI will always love you,‚Äô we‚Äôd talk when back. Friday, nothing from her. Saturday, she sent flight info‚Äîno ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô back. We both got home Saturday night‚Äîplanned to hug her, say ‚ÄòI‚Äôve missed you‚Äîyou‚Äôre my person,‚Äô fight for us. Walked in‚Äîno hug. She said I betrayed her trust, telling her fianc√© about her health issue‚Äî‚Äòmore than she could imagine.‚Äô Never thought her partner would do that, so angry she doesn‚Äôt know if she loves me or wants to work on this. Said she woke up Friday so angry, only looking back on bad things, couldn‚Äôt think of any good stuff. Didn‚Äôt understand why I could give her a good hug Thursday at the hotel but pull away or joke other times. Asked for more space to think. Also mentioned she was mad I reached out and talked to a mutual friend, mostly her friend. In the moment, I needed someone to talk too. Looking back, I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that. In the moment it felt like the only person who knew all 3 of us that would be able to help me understand.

I admitted I didn‚Äôt see how her always asking for physical touch and me not giving it hurt her ‚Äòtil then. Told her I see my faults in that now, especially wanting it from her, and how my stubbornness in fights‚Äînot taking responsibility, not defusing‚Äîhurt her too. Said I‚Äôm more to blame than I‚Äôve owned before, I see it all now, and I‚Äôm done with empty promises‚ÄîI want to put in the work. But her sister‚Äôs completely done with me, called their parents to arrange a hotel‚Äînow they‚Äôre beyond angry at me. She doesn‚Äôt see a future if they all hate me‚Äîshe‚Äôs stuck between them and me. I kept saying it‚Äôs us first, we can fix us then work on the rest together, but she‚Äôs hung up on the betrayal and her family mess. Last night‚ÄîSaturday‚Äîwe were in separate bedrooms; I barely slept. Said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry‚ÄîI love you,‚Äô left it. This morning, Sunday, March 30, she was up‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt bring up space, just talked small stuff in person: ‚ÄòNeed anything?‚Äô Made her breakfast, kept it light. She‚Äôs so close to ending it; I‚Äôm thrown. Never thought she‚Äôd doubt us‚ÄîI‚Äôve hurt her worse than I realized, losing control, joking about his stuff, spilling hers to him. Scared she‚Äôs pulling away for good.

Sat with her for about 20 mins on her bed before this. Was able to have small conversations about her week. Still very reserved. Said I would get stuff for the week dinners and she said she would figure it out and I didnt have too. Felt like very very small progress but progress none the less. Still wanted to maybe to go up to our hometown about an hour away on the weekend. I asked if she would still be going if it wasn‚Äôt for this and she said no. Would only be her dad there. Ended up sitting with me at dinner but she didn‚Äôt speak. I asked some very surface level questions and got basic answers back.

She ended up coming to say she was going to bed last night instead of just going to bed without saying anything. I apologized again. Left her a note on her coffee cup this morning. Apologizing for making her feel sad and angry. Told her to have a good day and week at work and that I love her. She ended up texted me at work thanking me for the note and letting me know when she would be home. Feels like very very small progress, but progress none the less. 

TL;DR : I fucked up. I broke her trust on something. But she knows I‚Äôm not a bad guy. I‚Äôve never betrayed her trust before. I‚Äôve never let something get to this. I want to fix this relationship. She‚Äôs my person. ",1,1743432635.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1jo4zql,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1jo4zql/no_one_can_stand_to_talk_to_you/,‚Äúno one can stand to talk to you‚Äù,"hey guys, i really need some advice. i‚Äôm a 21M barista who works at a popular coffee chain. 2  years ago I moved cross country to a new location of this chain coffee shop. 

Everyone at this location got along pretty well, though i noticed very quickly it was at the expense of an ‚Äúout‚Äù group, always 2 or 3 people who they would gossip about non stop on rotation. 

I really tried to be friendly and get to know them in the beginning, i would always ask what they were up to, how their partners were doing, and i was often met with cold responses. on multiple occasions they would make petty comments such as ‚Äúyou talk a lot huh?‚Äù I eventually wondered what it would look like if i didn‚Äôt initiate conversation, because they very clearly didn‚Äôt seem to like it. It turned into absolutely no one attempting to talk to me, which i thought was okay and maybe just the awkwardness of getting to know people. 

after that, i would hear things about me along the grapevine, such as i ‚Äúnever did anything‚Äù how i was ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and similar things. I would try to ask if there was anything i could help them task wise with when i worked with them and they would give me nothing answers like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt think so, we‚Äôre all caught up‚Äù but i would continue to hear the gossip behind my back. 

fast forward to yesterday. me and coworker A had a large argument. when we were pretty slow, i ended up taking out my homework and working on it when i looked over and saw coworker A was on their phone. 

Coworker A asked me ‚Äúwhat are you doing? we have a lot to do‚Äù
I responded ‚Äúi thought we were chilling because i noticed you were on your phone‚Äù 
Coworker A made a comment under their breath, something about how it was ‚Äújust like me, i never do anything‚Äù and i heard and responded ‚Äúthat is not true, i‚Äôm always helping with XYZ when we close together, and even then, i always ask what i can help you with. I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôve been so mean to me the past couple shifts we worked together‚Äù 
Coworker A responded ‚Äúi‚Äôm not mean to you, in fact i‚Äôm the only one here who can stand to talk to you‚Äù and i completely shut down. I didn‚Äôt respond at all. Coworker A continued saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just being honest‚Äù 

i‚Äôm really tired of all the gossiping. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Sometimes it really hurts me that my coworkers are so cruel, but most of the time i just want them to leave me alone. I‚Äôve never had these problems with coworkers in the past, or even ANY problems with coworkers in the past. what should i do?

1jo4zlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jo4zlk/i_thought_i_had_made_a_new_friend_but_i_guess_i/,I thought I had made a new friend but I guess I was wrong.,"For a bit of context. I'm a divorced man 33 years old (34 next month), my marriage broke down during COVID lockdown and I lost my son of 3 years in December of 2022. After some therapy I moved to a new city on August of 2023.

Where I come from is a small city with close family connections and a country vibe and ended up in a border city that's much more open mind and hectic. Traffic is pretty bad and the city is so big people try to avoid leaving their local areas to avoid said traffic. But the job opportunity is pretty great so I figured it was a nice chance to start from scratch.

I've been dating on and off with the help of bumble and tinder but I had no real luck finding someone to have a stable relationship even if I did give someone a shot and it didn't end up working.

Making friends hasn't been too easy but I've managed to make some good ones. I switched gym in December of last year and the girl working the reception was really cute. I'm not going to lie I kinda developed a small crush on her almost instantly. She was kind and friendly, but I'm not one to mistake that for flirting.

We always said ""hi"" and made small talk from time to time. Eventually I started buying protein shakes at the gym and turns out she's the one that prepares them and we talked even more. Again, not going to lie it got to a point where I was only buying them there just to talk with her.

So we were pretty much talking everyday she even added me on Instagram and gave me her number. Eventually I found out she had a boy friend, which she never told me about and didn't have any pictures with him either. No biggie, I was just glad I had someone to talk with. I then found out he was quite older 50M to her 25F and lived in the neighboring country. She started venting from time to time about him and always said that she wasn't happy with him, but didn't have the courage to break up with him.

To no make this longer we did hang out outside of the gym occasionally, and she would always pay for both, though I did find odd she never let me pay for my things even if I obviously was better off financially given our respective careers. We never hung out at night, but we would go for breakfast or coffee and the odd hiking excursion with a group. Nothing that I deemed questionable morally or ethically and this went on for about 2 months. One of my buddies said that it sounded like she had a crush on my and that I should make a move. But I said I'm not one to get in the middle of a relationship. It would be different if she was single, but I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize our friendship or her relationship. So I actively avoided doing anything questionable.

But things got weird on her birthday. She always said she liked to spend her birthdays alone and not be bothered and even planned on going paragliding. The paragliding thing is in a town about 30 mins away from the city and spent the weekend there. During the morning I sent her a happy birthday text and we spoke briefly during the afternoon and she stopped responding. I saw she uploaded a picture to her insta stories of her room with flowers and balloons and I figured she was with her BF and was busy. I was pretty happy she didn't spend her birthday alone so it didn't bother me at all.

The next morning I woke up and she unfriended me on IG and Facebook and didn't respond to me all day but when she got to the gym she acted pretty normal. She greeted me as always and gave me my shake and we talked like always, so I was pretty confused and even though I might had imagined it altogether, but I did check and she did unfriend me. The next day, same thing, greeted me the same and we talked like normal but this time I did ask if I did anything wrong or if she was upset with me. She said ""No, I just deleted a bunch of people on my birthday because I get depressed"". I asked ""but why me, we're friends no?"" and she replied ""Yes, but you didn't react to the picture I shared on my insta stories (the one with the flowers and balloons). So I figured if I'm so important to them but can't even react to a picture they must not care as much as I thought"". This kind of broke me.  After that she talked less and less with me until it got to a point that she treats my like we were never friends.

My friend said that most likely she was expecting me to make a move on her birthday and that she was upset I left her in the friendzone. I'm not big on drama so on one side I believe it's the best scenario (given the circumstances) since I can still come to the gym without feeling awkward, but if does hurt that I lost a good friend and am feeling a bit lonelier ever since.

* Consider your wake-up time, workout routine, and social life when planning your schedule.

üçé **What to Eat for Best Results:**

* **Whole Foods:** Fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.
* **Hydration Matters:** Water, herbal tea, and black coffee (without sugar or cream) are great during fasting.
* **Protein is Key:** Helps maintain muscle mass and keeps you full longer.

üö® **Common Mistakes That Prevent Weight Loss:**

* Overeating during the eating window.
* Not getting enough protein or fiber.

A story about asking a girl out and the ensuing comedic chaos: I decided today was the day. No more pining after Clara, the librarian with the perpetually smudged glasses and an encyclopedic knowledge of cat breeds. No more awkwardly lingering near the ""Romance"" section (for ""research,"" of course). Today, I was going to ask her out. My meticulously planned opening line, ""Excuse me, do you know where I can find‚Ä¶ a date with you?"" felt a bit clunky in my head, but I figured confidence was key. I even ironed my best (and only) argyle sweater. I marched into the library, breathing deeply, and spotted Clara perched on a stool, reshelving a cart full of what looked like excessively depressing novels. This was it. Showtime. I cleared my throat. ""Excuse me, Clara?"" She looked up, her brow furrowed. ""Yes? Can I help you find something?"" I swallowed, suddenly feeling like my tongue was glued to the roof of my mouth. ""Um, yes. Well, no. I mean, yes, you can. I was wondering‚Ä¶"" A small, ginger cat sauntered out from behind the bookshelf and wound itself around her legs. Clara beamed. ""Oh, hello, Mr. Whiskers! Are you helping me with my work today?"" She didn't even acknowledge my existence. Distracted, I thought, ""perfect, a feline wingman."" I continued, ""I was wondering‚Ä¶ if you might, perhaps, maybe, possibly, be interested in‚Ä¶ going out sometime?"" Mr. Whiskers, apparently unimpressed with my romantic overture, chose that moment to launch himself onto my argyle sweater, claws extended. ""AH!"" I yelped, trying to dislodge the furry projectile. ""Bad kitty! Bad!"" Clara gasped. ""Mr. Whiskers! Down! He's just a little‚Ä¶ enthusiastic."" She pried the cat off me, leaving a trail of pulled threads and a very grumpy ginger blur. ""Enthusiastic?"" I spluttered, trying to smooth down my ravaged sweater. ""He looks like he's auditioning for a horror movie!"" Clara giggled. It was the most beautiful, melodic giggle I‚Äôd ever heard, even if it was directed at my current state of disarray. ""I'm so sorry,"" she said, still chuckling. ""He gets a little protective of me. So, what was it you were saying about going out?"" My brain short-circuited. Was she actually considering this after the Cat Attack of '23? ""Uh‚Ä¶ yeah. Well, I was thinking maybe we could, I don't know, grab some coffee? Or maybe see a movie? I hear there's a documentary about the migratory patterns of‚Ä¶ dust bunnies. It's supposed to be‚Ä¶ riveting."" I cringed. Dust bunnies? Really? Clara bit her lip, trying (and failing) to suppress another laugh. ""A dust bunny documentary? That‚Ä¶ sounds‚Ä¶ unique."" ""Yeah, unique. That's what I was going for! Unique!"" I mentally slapped myself. Suddenly, a loud voice boomed from the back of the library. ""CLARA! DID YOU RE-SHELVE THOSE ROMANCE NOVELS YET? I NEED TO FIND SOMETHING FOR MRS. HIGGINBOTTOM! SHE'S IN HERE CRYING ABOUT HER EX-HUSBAND AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO START EATING THE COOKIES AGAIN!"" Clara‚Äôs eyes widened. ""Oh dear, that's Mrs. Higginsbottom's emergency cookie protocol. I have to go! Listen,"" she said, grabbing a pen and a stray bookmark. ""Here's my number. Text me about that‚Ä¶ unique‚Ä¶ date. And maybe bring a catnip toy. Just in case."" She winked and rushed off towards the sound of impending cookie-related doom. I stood there, clutching the bookmark and my shredded sweater, staring after her. I had survived a cat attack, offered a date centered around dust bunnies, and witnessed a potential baked-good-related crisis. It wasn't exactly the romantic fairytale I had envisioned. But hey, at least I had her number. And maybe, just maybe, Mr. Whiskers would approve of me eventually. After all, I was now clearly a man who knew how to handle a crisis. Even if that crisis involved a ginger cat and the potential for excessive cookie consumption.

In a bold and slightly uncomfortable move, mega-retailer E-Marst has launched what they‚Äôre calling ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Customer Experience Giveaway.‚Äù The catch? Shoppers are being asked to submit Memory Transcript Segments of their most cherished moments at the store for a chance to win free groceries for a year.


Yes, you read that right: E-Marst wants your brain scans.


The promotion, unveiled in a social media post yesterday, has left the galaxy baffled. ‚ÄúWe are not just a store, we are an experience.‚Äù wrote the chain's social media account, ‚ÄúWe want to know how our stores have shaped your life. Did aisle 7 inspire your first love? Did our discount vegan ice cream get you through a breakup? Send us your memory transcript, and you could be our next big winner!‚Äù The deadline to submit memory transcripts is April 30, 2155, or, as the promotion puts it, ‚Äúuntil we‚Äôve collected enough nostalgia to fill a warehouse.‚Äù 


As part of the promotion, E-Marst has also installed ‚ÄúMemory Booths‚Äù in select locations, where customers can scan their memories, and select what to submit for the promotion. All while sipping complimentary E-Marst-brand coffee. The process, according to details at their site, involves customers using a ‚Äúnon-invasive neural upload device‚Äù (something available on most hospitals) to extract and submit their shopping-related memories. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as easy as putting on a hat.‚Äù said a spokesperson, ignoring our reporter‚Äôs question about whether the devices were approved for civilian use by any government.


Privacy advocates are already sounding the alarm. ‚ÄúThis is a grocery store, not a medical facility.‚Äù said Dr. Etoli, of the Sapient Rights Institute, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next, trading your childhood trauma for a coupon on frozen pizza?‚Äù Meanwhile, E-Marst insists all data will be ‚Äúsecurely stored‚Äù and only used to ‚Äúenhance customer experience,‚Äù though their fine print mentions potential sharing with ‚Äúselect marketing partners.‚Äù


Reaction from the public has been predictably mixed. Linda Grayson, 62, was skeptical. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting anyone rummage through my head just for a shot at free toilet paper.‚Äù Meanwhile, Gojid teen Jakker, 17, was all in: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a killer memory of sneaking a whole rotisserie chicken out in a hoodie. If they want it, they can have it, free food is free food.‚Äù


The grand prize, a year‚Äôs worth of groceries up to one hundred thousand credits, has sparked a frenzy among bargain hunters, with some already posting their memory transcripts on social media to drum up support. One viral post read: ‚ÄúSubmitted my memory of finding a bag of mangoes in the clearance bin. Felt like winning the lottery. #EMarstMemories.‚Äù Another user quipped, ‚ÄúDoes my recurring nightmare of getting lost in the meat section count?""


Whether this is a marketing masterstroke or a step too far, one thing‚Äôs clear: E-Marst has officially taken the concept of customer loyalty to a whole new level.

1. i lost a folder a week ago. it‚Äôs very important. it has a *home* (everything has a home in my home. it‚Äôs place. it never leaves that spot. i know where it is all times ) 

the folder had my rent money , $2000 essentially worth of gift cards and cash. 

i couldn‚Äôt find it. i stayed up until 4am looking for it. i was UPSET. 

2. gift cards. above. 
i went to a store with my daughter. the gift card for the store was in this folder. i explained to the worker above. i said i did a return. a credit. that was the gift card. they found it on my profile on their computer. great. 

we get a change room set up. my daughter is trying on grad dresses. can‚Äôt find my phone. 

what the fuck. 

i look through my purse. my shopping bags. i said to her one sec. i can‚Äôt find my phone. 

( i HAD IT in line while talking to the worker because i was looking for the e receipt. i obviously set it down )

it ended up being ‚Äú turned in ‚Äú but i‚Äôll circle back to this 


3. i went thrifting this week. i found cash in an item i picked up. (donated and likely didn‚Äôt check the pockets. nor did the workers )
my brain shut off. i don‚Äôt know how to explain it. i didn‚Äôt move. i was shaking. i didn‚Äôt know if i could take it. should i take it? 
i ended up in there FOR AN HOUR (a part of time before i was shopping but still) 

something , mentally. was definitely big time bizarre and not right. 

yay. free money. anyway. 


4.  i lost my phone this morning. again!!!
this is all in the last 7 days!!!!!! i‚Äôm gonna lose my shit. 

i woke up in a good mood. i said that to my mom. i was gonna walk to starbucks. grab smokes. have music. 
she starts yapping. i can‚Äôt blame her saying she derailed my thought process. but it was derailed. 

i changed my purse this morning. 

i go get coffee. no phone. cool. 

now i‚Äôm like wtf. again. 

long story short. the bag i switched to, it had that stupid cardboard thing you can take out if you want it boxy looking or loose. it was under that üôÑ 



i see my doctor tomorrow and i wrote all this down because i‚Äôm just DONE. i feel like i need a stupid dunce cap and bright red backpack üéí from a kindergartener because the simplest task i have a meltdown. and obviously my brain is all over the place. 


help.  please. üò≠ 

(yes. i‚Äôm medicated. ) 
i DID buy a CBD pen with barely any thc. have not been smoking it regularly. that‚Äôs the only thing that may have fucked with me. but like ??? it‚Äôs CBD. i‚Äôve never had an issue with it. 

maybe it‚Äôs not vibing with my meds. idk. 

also started taking multi vitamins. highly doubt that. 

ETA. see. even forgot to talk about the retail / phone thing. 

so i‚Äôll make this quick. my first suspicion was that i left my phone on the counter and whoever was behind us in line grabbed my phone. realized it‚Äôs locked. an older model. and brought it back. 

but then the day after my brain went sinister. 

i told the retail worker about point 1. i‚Äôm obviously not mentally well. i was very clear i‚Äôve been misplacing things. this was a discussion with ONE worker. 

i think i left my phone. she grabbed it. and thought. she‚Äôs not well. there‚Äôs a 50/50 chance she‚Äôll ask. 

it was close to closing time. if i didn‚Äôt ask. the next day it would have been ‚Äúlong gone‚Äù 

when i approached her the first time and asked. she just did a quick glance behind a very large cash area (like 8 tills) and said uh nope. don‚Äôt think so. 

i scoffed and went back to the fitting area (both areas were out of sight line ) maybe 5 minutes later. the same worker came back and asked about my case. i described it. she made a weird face 

she came back holding it. 

i think she took it. 

because the weird first ask , she barely moved. like one foot pivot. checked a drawer. it was odd. 

if that‚Äôs the case. i‚Äôve lost all hope in humanity. 

i was vulnerable. i explained i lost something. to LOSE something AGAIN and say fuck her. i‚Äôll take this. she won‚Äôt know. 

idk. 



TLDR. i‚Äôve just been a dysfunctional mess for the last week and respectfully i feel like i‚Äôve gone FULL R*TARD mode. (you never go full‚Ä¶. ) if you get the joke. you get it. i‚Äôm not trying to be offensive. 

i‚Äôve lost my phone like three times now. i‚Äôm obviously not paying attention

I purchased the machine to make milk based drinks primarily and they are warm at best. The milk when using the Latte setting is barely even warmed and not much thicker than coming out of the container and the Latte Macchiato setting gets a little warmer and actually thickens some but it still seems too cold. I took some temp readings with a kitchen thermometer to quantify the temps I was seeing below.

I have the coffee temp set to high and there is no milk temp as best I can find in the menus and manual. All temps were taken with milk out of the fridge into a cup at room temp (70 deg F approx).

Latte setting:
Espresso: 144 deg F
Milk: 119 deg F

Latte Macchiato setting: 
Milk: 134 deg F
Espresso: 144 deg F

I realize no super automatic is a perfect replacement for an experienced batista at a cafe but I feel like I paid a lot of money ($1800 CAD) for a machine that I take my drink from and put straight into the microwave...

I (29F) married the love of my life (31M) last January. We only invited our close friends and family. However, one particular guest caught my attention that day. Let's call her Faith (31F).

Just a little back story, Faith and my husband were friends since highschool. She is part of his inner circle and is very close to him. When he and I became a couple, I tried to get to know his circle of friends so that I could build a good relationship with them, and to show that I do care about the people that my then-boyfriend loves. As an introvert, I tried to set lunch meetings or coffee meet-ups with only 1-2 of his friends at a time to avoid being overwhelmed since I feel really anxious and drained in big groups. He is also always with me during those lunchdates. I asked him if we could invite Faith so that I could get to know her. He asked her and her response was, ""why is there a need to meet up?"", and did not agreed to meet me. When I heard it, I thought that maybe she is just not comfortable with people she's not close with. I did not push anymore.  

Four  years ago, my then-boyfriend and I broke up. But after 1 year, we reconnect, and rekindled our relationship. After sometime, I learned from him that when we broke up, Faith became closer to him as she initiates calls and chats to check up on him. She also asks him to go out for coffee to help him process his hurts. However, their friends thought that maybe it is not a good timing since he and I just broke up, and it also looks like she is taking advantage of the situation. They talked to her, and, to echo my husband's words, ""knock some sense to her"". Fortunately, she did not take it against them, and she is still good friends with my husband.

Anyway, Faith wore white to my wedding. At first, I was surprised, but then I realize, why should I worry about that? I am getting married with the one I love, and my family and friends are there to witness this joyous event. I should not allow myself to be distracted. Also, I thought she looks good in her dress, and I thought maybe she has no ill-motives and just like the dress that she's wearing. Apparently, not everyone appreciates her choices, specially my husband. At one point, he asked if I was okay and if I wanted him to talk to her and ask her to leave. I said no, and said that it doesn't really bothers me. I also thanked him and said that I appreciate that he wants to protect me against anything that could ruin my day. 

At one point in the reception, Faith comes at me and said that she's glad that I am not bothered that she wears white. She said that she was ""worried"" that she might offend me because of the color of her dress, but still chose to wear white because ""she looks so pretty and bridal in that dress"". I was taken a back, I mean why would she wanted to look ""bridal"" at someone else's wedding? That is ridiculous! She also said, in her exact words, ""I am also impressed that you are not afraid that I might upstaged you."". I said, ""Oh no, I am not afraid at all! Why would I?"" and laugh. She grew quiet, and excuse herself. Later, I learned from one of their friends, let's call her Ella, that Faith was offended. Apparently, she told their friends that I was being arrogant and that I thought that she is not pretty enough to be a threat to me. She is also insulted that I laugh, and finds it very disrespectful. I never meant it to be that way. My husband thinks that I did nothing wrong and if anything, it was trashy (his exact words) that Faith wore that dress. Ella thinks otherwise. She said that I should have not laugh and handled the situation better and that I am being petty. She also mentioned that as a woman, I should not make other woman feel less beautiful. I know I did not intend to offend Faith, but maybe I am just being insensitive? AITA?",77,1743431670.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,54,1.0,False

It‚Äôs wonderful to be in a place where I‚Äôm no longer ashamed of who I was as a young woman, or of the mistakes that I made along the way. Like any good story, I hope that this one demonstrates that, as humans, we are all:

* Flawed
* Worthy of love 
* Capable of more than we think
* Deserving of forgiveness

Here goes:

Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I‚Äôd had a ‚Äúme‚Äù when I was growing up. Someone to teach me yoga and lead me through self-care practices, or someone to softly tell me that my body and mind are perfect and worthy of respect, just the way that they are.

From my late teens to early 20s I really struggled to manage my anxiety and depression. I drank and practiced self-harm to reduce anxiety, which (along with the bleak Minnesota winters) caused depression. When I was depressed, I would drink, which would then give way to more anxiety and depression. It was a vicious cycle, but I don‚Äôt blame myself. At that age, I didn‚Äôt really know any better.

In a single year I lost a close friend to suicide, had my heart broken for the first time, was fired, had a health scare, and was rejected by the university that I had dreamed of attending; a lot for any 17-year-old to handle. A few years later I fell down the stairs when I was drunk, fractured my jaw, and knocked a few of my teeth out. Combine all this with the fact that my mental health always seemed to be a shameful, ‚Äúhush hush‚Äù topic amongst family and most of my friends‚Ä¶ well, you get the picture. It was bleak, messy, and I had never felt more alone.

# Possibility & Hope

In 2011 I found a therapist in Minneapolis that I really trusted. Instead of prescribing me with more medication, like I requested, she taught me ‚Äúanti-anxiety breath‚Äù (what I now know to be pranayama) and told me to ‚Äúgo exercise three times per week.‚Äù

I reluctantly got a pass at the YMCA and started exercising. I‚Äôd watch the Twins play baseball on television while bopping around on the elliptical, not really sure what I was doing, but enjoying it all the same. The more I exercised, the less I drank. A few weeks later, I even found the courage to end my abusive relationship (after trying and failing multiple times). In a matter of weeks, my therapist‚Äôs advice had already begun to change my life.

As things started to improve, I got a job at a fine dining restaurant with a manager who taught me things like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to make mistakes, I won‚Äôt hold it against you,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen you mess up, don‚Äôt make excuses. Just apologize and move on.‚Äù To this day, I owe a debt of gratitude to him for teaching me about healthy conflict.

# Enter: Yoga

I walked into my first yoga class on a chilly night in February. It was a vinyasa class, and I had no idea what to expect. My therapist had recommended that I try yoga, but I thought it was a thing for ‚Äúweird hippies.‚Äù (Funny enough, I‚Äôd soon find out that¬†*I was*¬†a weird hippie.)

My first impression of yoga was that everyone was insane. I was surrounded by twenty adults, all of whom were making bizzare shapes with their bodies, rolling around on the floor and breathing in unison. I hung on for dear life, trying desperately not to look like an idiot.

After class, the instructor asked me if it was my first time doing yoga, clearly aware of the fact that I was out of my element. When I told him that yes, it was, he suggested that I join their ‚Äú30 Day Yoga Challenge,‚Äù and try practicing yoga every day, for thirty days.

I immediately signed up.

Over the next month, I fell in love. With the practice, the challenge, and the people. The lessons in self-love and self-care, and the new eyes through which I was seeing the world. It didn‚Äôt take long before I was obsessed.

# A New Perspective

With yoga came clarity. Yes, I was unhappy, but I didn‚Äôt need to stay that way. I could leave and start over if I wanted. How had I never realized that I was the one in the driver‚Äôs seat?

So, I packed up my things and moved to Chicago. Soon after, I took my first yoga teacher training (at the suggestion of an instructor that I admired), which gave me the courage to book my first solo trip around Europe. After my solo trip, I quit my job at a marketing firm to work at mushroom stand at a farmer‚Äôs market. A few months later, I decided to end my relationship, sell all my things, pack a backpack, and travel the world.

In the eight years that followed I lived in Tenerife, Costa Rica, the Cayman Islands, and mainland Spain, all the while learning about who I am, what I want, and sharing my love of yoga.¬†**It was a snowball effect.**¬†Life became bigger, and crazier, and more wonderful than I ever could have imagined, one small step at a time. (But that‚Äôs a story for another day.)

# My Why, Your Journey

Looking back, there has been one clear, guiding force throughout my life: the kindness of other people. Little pieces of advice, a listening ear, or helpful comments have led me to make large, lasting decisions that have sculpted me into the strong, confident woman that I am today.

When it comes down to it, we cannot do it alone.

It‚Äôs our connections that make life worth living.

Now, thirteen years after my first yoga class, I only have one goal:¬†**to pass on the kindness that I was shown and make a difference for someone else.**¬†Whether it‚Äôs through a¬†free online class, a yoga retreat, a cup of coffee, or a phone call, it‚Äôs my dharma to use what I‚Äôve learned to gently guide others on their own journey of self-discovery, curiosity, and joy.

If you‚Äôre struggling, I‚Äôm here for you. And if you‚Äôre celebrating, I‚Äôm here for you too. I am so grateful for this community where we can lift each other up and embrace the mysteries of life. Everything is more fun when you do it with friends.",4,1743431527.0,yoga,7,0.75,False

1jo4k3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1jo4k3j/customer_or_should_i_say_constant_loiterer_keeps/,Customer (or should I say constant loiterer) keeps making accusations.,"So I've been working at the same grocery store since fall 2016, started as a cashier and about a year or 2,  so obviously I've heard my fair share of complaints over the years and usually I just let it go (except for like my first week in the booth and I was new to it and an older customer almost made me cry but that was years ago and I was only like 19).

 However there's this one woman who has shopped (or should I say comes almost everyday, basically loiters at our mini eating area for hours, takes free oyster crackers, samples and free coffee) about a year ago approached me while I was walking down and aisle
and accused me of sitting behind her one day when I was on break and kicking her seat at the booth she was sitting at, I told her no I didn't (in the nicest way possible) and she pointed her finger at me and said ""yes you did"" and walked away, so I told a coworker (in a wtf, jokingly way) and she told me just ignore her since she's a little off anyway which I knew so I didn't think anything of it. 

And then this past Friday, after I left work, one of the cashiers (not knowing it was her items, assuming it was left behind by a customer) brought her items to the front desk, she (after going to other stores in our plaza) came back saw her stuff was moved, went to the front desk, asked whoever was in the booth where her stuff was told her someone moved it since it was sitting there for a couple hours unattended, to which she responded to the boy in the customer service desk ""if it was (my name) tell her to keep her hands off my shit"" first of all this would've been hours after I left which the boy in the desk did say ""(my name) wasn't even there and someone else brought it up and the cashier who did it was just doing his job"" and I know she doesn't like me after the ""kicking"" accusations so obviously I wouldn't touch her shit just to get yelled at by her. 


But it's not just the kicking and moving her stuff accusations that bothers me the most because she's made all types of accusations against others too accused a customer of stalking her because he shops there often and has seen him multiple times there and a couple weeks ago accused one of our nighttime highschool cashier's of stalking her too because he got a sip of water while she so happened to be at one of the booths and made a complaint against him and on top of all that has followed a worker from a different department to his car into our employee parking lot.

Like I know managers don't want things to get messy so they try to avoid complications and confrontations, and they figure she's harmless but I am getting fed up that we let this woman come in, leave her stuff at one of our booths, walks around the store never buying anything, then makes a few phone calls, leaves her stuff at the booths for hours, shops around the plaza, comes back and never buys anything gets to just make accusations, make a cashier uncomfortable (he switched his availability to try and avoid getting another accusation from her) and has started arguments with the customer she's accused of stalking her (which we did check the cameras in the store to see if he was following her around and he wasn't, he just ate his lunch and left) and she just gets away with all of it. Apparently our store manager was gonna have a talk with her but she left before he could, so maybe they will actually say something to her but I don't think it'll happen. 

Tldr: Constant loiterer makes accusations, never buys anything, takes up a booth from the afternoon to the evening, leaves her items at the booth so no one will sit there thinking someone's already there, harassed a fellow employee, is rude anytime I (and anyone she's decided to find a reason to not like) tries to actually help her and nothing is said to her and I've just about had it.",8,1743431446.0,retailhell,3,0.9,False

I spend plenty of my time thinking about our early days. How good of a friend you were, all the times I could hear you smiling through the ether. All the beautiful things you said to me. And as I am watching our time wave from above, I see where the ripples begin. Where chaos came in and things shifted. 

It was more than just my warm body in the crowded rooms we seem to share. It was the glances where I begged you to see that I loved you. It was the iMessages where I waxed poetic. It was the audio clips where I sang my own songs for you. It was the blurred photographs and missed calls. 

*I* crossed that line. Me. Not you.

I remember telling you to figure out how to talk to me safely. Find a different place to communicate. And you managed to make your way to me, ever so cautiously. Ghastlier than any cute ghost I‚Äôve ever seen. I spotted you. I recognized the way you text. I could feel your heart bleeding out for me and I thought, ‚Äúfucking finally.‚Äù 

But the way you came to me left me with many questions. Like that time we meant to share coffee on a bench, you eating a peach scone and us holding hands. I didn‚Äôt want to see anyone but you. So since you came guised, I didn‚Äôt trust it and bailed last minute. And I haven‚Äôt really gotten over that. Things would be so much different than they are now had I not let fear jump in. 

We‚Äôve been through things that would have left others permanently divided. We‚Äôve dragged our bodies lifeless through dense forests in hopes the other would be there at the clearing. So yeah, I want forever with you. 

I want you to eat fresh fruit with you.

I want you to call me on your way home.

I want to hear your voice early in the morning.

I want to kiss that nook between your nose and eye.

I want to fall asleep with you at night.

I want disagreements and finding resolve.

I want all of you. 

You‚Äôre my favorite person. My best friend. I‚Äôd walk through any hell for you. I‚Äôll bring the hand basket

There is a coworker 24f that has been there for a couple years now. Her and I did not speak for awhile besides saying hi a couple of times, we never got scheduled in positions where we‚Äôd see each other to put it in simple terms. Eventually, we got scheduled to work together, and we really hit it off. We have a lot in common and get along really well. We started talking a lot more at work. I usually walk home from work, and she offered to give me a ride one day, and then started offering almost everyday to drive me home. It is inconvenient for her to do this, because she has a parking pass for a parking lot that you have to take a shuttle to, so when she parks there I just walk home because it‚Äôs faster for me to do so. But sometimes, she‚Äôll park in a lot right by our job that is walking distance, much faster to get to, but you have to pay to park there daily it is not included with the pass. So when she parks in the closer lot she asks to drive me home since I live about 5 minutes from work. At first, she just drove me a couple times, but then she started parking in the closer lot almost everyday we worked together and asking me if I want a ride home. When she drives me, we park by my house and will usually end up talking for over 2 hours just about any and everything. I was thinking at first, oh this will be a great new friend to have. Then, she started bringing me snacks and coffee everyday to work. And when I‚Äôve been training to do new stuff, she‚Äôll be across the building working and coming over several times to help me with what I‚Äôm training on, without me asking. I thought she was being really nice. But then, I told her this last time we drove home, about a girl I was into recently, because I finally felt comfortable to open up about being bisexual as I don‚Äôt tell just anyone. She had also only told me about dating guys, so I thought she was straight and it made me scared to open up about it. After I tell her the story, she comments on it and says ‚Äúwho says I‚Äôm not into girls, I‚Äôm bi.‚Äù Then after this, I started thinking about everything.

1jo4ild,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1jo4ild/crash_course_on_addiction/,Crash course on addiction,"Addiction is still really prevalent in today‚Äôs society. Most people on a spiritual path (spoiler alert every human is on a spiritual path) 
Have figured out early on why addiction is a detriment to their spiritual health. 

But these days are dark and weary and I want to post a crash course on addiction for those who want to refresh their commitment and or understanding of addiction. 

How addiction works: 
You are born. You are a being of light. You attract love and light. 

You have experiences which teach you about life , about who you want to be. 

Disempowerment happens - at a certain point you become disempowered for some reason. 
-
not understanding or knowing how to become empowered again- you turn to substances to numb pain or replace the thing which you are seeking. 
Essentially you are like suckling at the teet of the devil (metaphor only) because the milk is sour- it never nourishes you- it never gives you what you need. 


Or- in some cases - you simply are not taught the importance of avoiding addictions so you easily fall into the habits or ideas which are introduced to you. 
In this case young people can become heroin addicts etc because they don‚Äôt have enough mental guardrails to protect them from offers from others to become heroin addicts - this is why education in areas that are prone to addiction is so important. 

How to break the addiction cycle : 
If your addiction is something innocuous like food , porn , working out at the gym (yes some people have an addiction to looking good ) , 
Try to slowly distance yourself from your immediate urge to turn to that thing whenever things aren‚Äôt going right. 

<b>Ask yourself, what do I think this thing is giving me or what do I hope this thing or behavior gives me ? </b>

Most people are secretly seeking empowerment from their addictions. They want to be strong, capable , wise , but their life has taken them to a point where they don‚Äôt feel strong capable or wise. 
They maybe lost a job or a relationship- they don‚Äôt process their grief or have a good outlook for the future, maybe the outlook it beyond their control and so they turn to a substance that will soothe their disappointment. 

Examples: the woman who has to have iced coffee every day in a certain type of mug , or she freaks out - 
Wants to feel strong capable and happy, but instead feels immobilized, mollified and spurned by society who wants her to look and act in a more demure way. 

Examples : the man who becomes a body builder because he was bullied as a child , but now he can‚Äôt stop- he has to work out every day and he has to assert to others how strong he is. If he doesn‚Äôt he feels small, insecure and his self concept is destroyed. 

The woman who watches tv every day, morning noon and night - 
Or has to have tv or radio on in the background - 
Wants mental peace - but she has so much subconscious mental activity that she doesn‚Äôt know how to find mental peace. Her only solution is to flood the airwaves with other people‚Äôs sounds. 

There are many possible examples of subtle addictions. I hope this post was helpful to people. Also please check out this guy Brian withers on YouTube who pretty much breaks it down . Link posted below. 

<bold> Why it‚Äôs important to overcome
Addictions: 
Addictions stop us from
Accessing our highest light and purpose on earth. The earth needs many embodied empowered people , it does not need more disempowered people. 
Although addiction can be a useful learning experience and is in some cases even written into someone‚Äôs life path, ultimately we need more empowered light filled people to help uplift the planet . 

Spiritual addictions : 
Believing that crystals and rituals are the source of power rather than you and your relationship to god/source/ the divine is the source of power. While crystals and rituals can be a fun way to engage with spirits and the divine, people sometimes mistake the crystals for the source of power and magic. You are the source of power and magic. 

Having to meditate all the time so you don‚Äôt have to do difficult things- using soothing rituals to prevent yourself from having to tackle challenges in life . Demanding that other people support your ‚Äúpeace ‚Äú or admonishing and shaming others for not supporting your ‚Äúpeace ‚Äú . These people can be hard to spot because they appear very zen on the surface. They often lack genuine compassion for others. 


Attending church or obsessively watching religious advice videos to get confirmation over and over so you don‚Äôt have to make your own decisions . God gave us discernment and free will. Also, if spirit wants to deliver a message to you- they will do it.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I would like to tell a little about my Overactive Bladder Syndrome. I am 29M, have been suffering from this since 2021. Didnt realise this until 2023 to be honest, had a very tough time managing life and peeing constantly. The biggest triggers were caffeine and carbonated drinks.

So, from 2023 I stopped masturbating regularly, caffeine and carbonated drinks including beer. Only Gin was the alcohol which helped soothe my bladder. Did all sorts of tests there was, everything was normal, no internal abnormality as such. However, one doctor told me that my bladder holding size had reduced which felt weird because until maybe 26, it was all fine.

  
Late last year I started with a some meds, mainly Mirabegron which really helped but was not a complete solution. I also realised that going in warmer climates helped improve my bladder strength. I live in Germany so whenever I went to Spain or other countries, I always came back with a bladder with almost no overactive syndrome. However, whenever I masturbated maybe 2-3 times a week, it used to come back. I did masturbate all this time, because I read online that masturbation doesn't really affect but I have realise that it does. Along with Mirabegron, I did also stop caffeine, moved to decaf coffee (really helps), drank some soothing tea and was off carbonated completely. I also started exercises for pelviv floor or overactive bladder syndrome twice a day. Things improved and everything felt normal.

  
Right now, I again have symptoms because of masturbation maybe once in 2 weeks, but I have realised that it has come back because the nerves / veins around that area weaken. I am off caffeine and carbonated drinks again, smoking is also bad and also off sweets.  So, what I do now is to avoid masturbation / sex as much as possible now, untilt the strength improves (which will improve erection), will take a short course of Mirabegron and I think the most effective doing regular exercises for the pelvic floor and for the syndrome. Hope this helps!

---------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, many people are searching for effective ways to manage stress and improve overall health. One significant trend that has emerged in this quest for wellness is the use of adaptogens. Known for their natural ability to help the body adapt to stress and promote balance, adaptogens are becoming a staple in modern wellness practices.

So, what exactly are adaptogens? These are natural substances, often derived from herbs and plants, that support the body's ability to stabilize internal processes during periods of stress. The concept of adaptogens has its roots in traditional medicine, particularly in regions like Asia and Eastern Europe, where they‚Äôve been used for centuries. Today, adaptogens are gaining wide recognition in health circles as more people seek holistic approaches to wellness.

Some of the most popular adaptogens include:

- **Ashwagandha:** Frequently used in Ayurvedic medicine, ashwagandha is known for reducing anxiety and improving stamina.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This herb is often utilized to enhance mood and support cognitive function, especially during stressful times.
- **Holy Basil:** Known for its anti-inflammatory properties, holy basil helps regulate cortisol levels, which are linked to stress.
- **Ginseng:** Often taken to increase energy and focus, ginseng also boosts the immune system's performance.

The benefits of adaptogens extend beyond stress reduction. These natural wonders serve various purposes, enhancing both mental and physical well-being. Here‚Äôs how they matter significantly in modern wellness:

- **Stress Management:** Adaptogens like ashwagandha and Rhodiola help the body respond effectively to stress. They assist in balancing hormone levels, specifically cortisol, which can lead to improved emotional resilience.
- **Boosting Energy Levels:** Many adaptogens, such as ginseng, can act as natural stimulants. They support your body's energy levels without the crash typical of caffeine.
- **Improving Mental Clarity:** Adaptogens can enhance cognitive functions, like focus and memory, particularly in stressful environments. This is especially true for adaptogens like Rhodiola Rosea, known to help with mental fatigue.
- **Supporting Immune Function:** Stress can weaken the immune system. Adaptogens work to strengthen this system, making it more resilient to illnesses.
- **Promoting Emotional Stability:** Using adaptogens regularly can lead to better mood regulation, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Adaptogens into your daily routine can be as simple as enjoying herbal teas, supplements, or powdered extracts added to smoothies. They can easily be included in your morning rituals, making it more convenient to reap their benefits. However, it‚Äôs essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking medication.

Moreover, mindfulness practices complement adaptogen use beautifully. Engaging in yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises can enhance the effectiveness of these herbs by creating a more serene mind and environment. You don‚Äôt just want to add adaptogens to your routine; you want to embrace a holistic approach to wellness that recognizes the interplay between mind, body, and spirit.

As more research emerges about the safety and efficacy of adaptogens, it‚Äôs evident that they hold promise in supporting modern wellness strategies. They allow individuals to manage the effects of everyday stressors while promoting a sense of balance and well-being. By integrating adaptogens into your life, you are taking proactive steps toward enhancing not just physical health but emotional and mental stability as well.

Adaptogens play a crucial role in modern wellness. Their ability to adapt to the body's needs makes them invaluable allies in navigating today‚Äôs stress-laden environment. By incorporating these natural substances into your routine, you can embrace a healthier, more balanced life, ensuring that you thrive in whatever challenges come your way.

How Adaptogens Help Combat Stress and Promote Balance
-----------------------------------------------------

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, stress has become an everyday reality for many. You may feel overwhelmed by work responsibilities, family obligations, or constant notifications from your devices. This is where adaptogens come into play. These naturally occurring plant-based substances have gained popularity for their potential to combat stress and promote a sense of balance in your life.

Adaptogens are specific herbs and roots that help your body adapt to stress. They can enhance resilience and support your overall well-being. Some common adaptogens include ashwagandha, rhodiola, holy basil, and ginseng. Each of these powerful plants offers unique benefits that can significantly impact your mental and physical health.

One of the primary ways adaptogens function is by regulating your body‚Äôs stress response system. They work by balancing cortisol levels, the hormone primarily responsible for stress. High cortisol levels can lead to a range of health issues, from anxiety and depression to digestive problems and sleep disturbances. Adaptogens help your body maintain healthy cortisol levels, which can result in a more stable mood and improved energy levels.

Here are a few specific adaptogens and how they can help you:

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for its calming properties, ashwagandha has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. It can lower cortisol levels and reduce anxiety, helping you feel more centered.
- **Rhodiola:** This herb is famous for increasing stamina and endurance. Rhodiola can help combat fatigue, improve mental clarity, and enhance your body‚Äôs resilience to stress.
- **Holy Basil:** Often referred to as ‚Äúthe queen of herbs,‚Äù holy basil can help manage stress and anxiety. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can boost your immune system.
- **Ginseng:** Ginseng is well known for its energy-boosting properties. It helps improve focus and concentration while supporting your body‚Äôs adaptive response to stress.

Adaptogens into your daily routine can be a game-changer. They are available in various forms, including capsules, powders, teas, and tinctures. You can easily add them to your smoothies, coffee, or even soups and stews. This versatility makes them accessible for anyone looking to improve their health and wellness.

It's important to note that while adaptogens offer many benefits, they should complement a balanced lifestyle rather than replace healthy habits. You still need adequate sleep, a nutritious diet, and regular physical activity to maximize their effectiveness. When combined, these habits can create a well-rounded approach to managing stress and enhancing your overall health.

Moreover, it‚Äôs crucial to consider the quality and sourcing of adaptogens. Look for products that are organic, non-GMO, and sourced from reputable suppliers. This ensures that you are getting the most potent and effective forms of these beneficial herbs. You might also want to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking medication.

As awareness of mental health and well-being continues to rise, understanding the role of adaptogens in modern wellness is essential. They can serve as an impressive ally in your journey toward stress relief and balance, allowing you to navigate life's challenges more effectively. By choosing appropriate adaptogens for your needs, you can promote a higher quality of life.

Keep in mind that everyone responds differently to adaptogens. What works wonders for one person may not have the same effect on another. It's about finding the right balance for yourself. Experiment with different types of adaptogens and observe how your body responds. If you pay attention to these changes, you‚Äôll be better equipped to manage stress and foster a sense of balance in your everyday life.

### Conclusion

By integrating adaptogens into your daily routine, you can experience a more balanced approach to managing stress, whether through herbal supplements, teas, or culinary uses.

Adaptogens such as ashwagandha, rhodiola, and holy basil work by supporting your adrenal system and regulating hormones that play a crucial role in your stress response. This support helps maintain not only your mental clarity but also your physical health, keeping you resilient amidst the challenges life throws your way. By promoting balance in your mind and body, adaptogens create a foundation for better health outcomes.

Adaptogens into your wellness routine doesn't mean completely changing your lifestyle; it's about making small, manageable adjustments that fit into your existing habits. Whether you‚Äôre faced with daily stressors or seeking to enhance your overall vitality, these herbs can empower you to reclaim your equilibrium. Ultimately, adaptogens serve as a bridge to a healthier, more balanced life, allowing you to thrive in a fast-paced world.

I have a Jura E8 recently descaled multiple times, puck comes out looking real good but when going to make a coffee sometimes the pour is mega slow, or comes directly out the drip tray.

On researching it seems the nozzles are clogged, is there an easy way to remove these and descale before committing to purchase new ones. 

Or any other thoughts to this issue?

Context:  I used to run a Dalmatian Rescue organization.  I took in a dog who was about 3 years old.  He had been a bait dog in a pitbull fighting ring in Alabama.  I had him transported to Florida, named him Rocky and mended his physical wounds and gave him the love and respect he needed and deserved.  At the time, I was living with a guy--total a&&hole to both me and Rocky.  He made no bones about seriously disliking Rocky.

And Rocky knew my bf didn't like him.  Soooooooo......

Rocky peed on literally EVERYTHING that the bf touched.  Dirty piles of HIS clothes?  Peed on.  His office chair?  Peed on.  His computer that smelled like him?  Peed on.  The side of the couch my bf would sit on?  Rocky would climb up on the couch and pee on that side of the couch.  He really didn't like my bf.  (At the end, neither did I but that's another post for another subreddit.)

One night, the bf and I were watching TV.  He was drunk (as usual) and shoveling hands-full of popcorn into his gaping maw.  Some pieces were falling out of his maw and back into the bowl.  I was not eating the popcorn.  He had his feet kicked up on the coffee table and his Birkenstocks were on the floor.  Rocky walked over to me and got some scritches and loving.  When we were done, he walked right past me, squatted over the bf's Birkenstocks and pooped right on them.  It was awesome, nice and runny and got into all the nooks and crannies of his sandals.

In the end, I got rid of the bf and kept the dog.  If Rocky didn't like a guy, there was no second date.

Good Boy, Rocky!  I love you and miss you so much.  See you at the Rainbow Bridge in a few years.  ",170,1743430762.0,pettyrevenge,24,0.94,False

Was sleeping less, drinking machine hot chocolate 4-5 times a day.   White hair doubled. Even my mother commented when she saw me at how gray I got since Xmas. 

Quit the job.  No change in grey.     Read on here about taking prenatal vitamins.   Found some girlie gummies that only had 12mg iron vs the normal 27mg prenatals have.     

My current stack is prenatal + iodine drops daily + b50 vitamins from Walmart daily.   Stopped shaving and Started growing beard out 100 percent.    Grayer than I expected, but in just one week all my hair is getting much much darker.   Girlfriend commented it's the darkest black she's seen my hair in years.   In mirror the area that was about 70 percent white seems to be 30 percent white.   (2 inch by 1 inch facial section).     Will continue letting it grow out and see if results continue.   

I have been doing iodine with sea kelp drops daily until I went back to office after Xmas and did it none.   I'm a meatatarian almost so assumed I never needed iron.  Also was never a coffee drinker but suspect the machine hot chocolate had coffee or caffeine in it.   I personally think the iodine and iron are what's helping too. . Also no more hot chocolate.

There are just SO many things that have pissed me off along the way. I see almost no mention of this stuff in reviews, so I feel like I'm crazy for noticing, but it's all so wild to me idk.

1.  \>!MMC is a victim of childhood abuse from both his mom and dad, where the dad once beat him over the head with a wrench and his mom would slap him!< and then the FMC slaps him across the face during an argument??? And it's basically brushed aside as an ""oopsie"" moment, then *he* apologizes to *her* for being a ""jerk"" afterward...like WHAT?
2. MMC shows minimal interest in his child from the start (the first thing he says when the FMC tells him about the baby is that he'll need to speak to his lawyer). I understand that this is partly related to his childhood trauma and the initial shock, but it was still shitty to see play out, especially with all the FMC has done to raise the baby by herself. It doesn't feel like he *really* starts to give a shit until he starts sleeping with the FMC again and sees a future with her.
3. Of course, the FMC didn't have sex with anyone during the 2 years they were separated, while it's implied that the MMC fucked around a bunch. Part of the FMC's """"flaws"""" are that she's perceived by the town as this wild child or whatever, and while it seems like she's comfortable and confident in her sexuality in the beginning, that just...evaporates over time. On top of that, I think the MMC tells her at one point that he wouldn't have minded ""waiting"" if he knew he was gonna get to fuck her again, which, like. Ew.
4. The FMC is working HER ASS OFF trying to raise the baby, and the MMC does absolutely jackshit to help during a critical period. She runs a coffee shop with her friend, and while the friend is away on her honeymoon for a week, the FMC is left to manage the place by herself. She's literally working from 5 AM until well into the evening for six days straight, asking family members for help with the baby, and the MMC DOES NOTHING!! He even shows up to the coffee shop to eat, and his teammate comments that the FMC looks stressed, and the MMC just says, ""Yeah, she does"" and shrugs it off????
5. The first time they hook up after having a whole ass child together, the MMC doesn't bother to ask if she's on birth control, hits it raw, and then finishes inside her. Like how fucking stupid can you be? üò≠
6. This one may be kind of small comparatively, but it rubbed me the wrong way whenever the FMC gets emotional, she says, ""Ugh, sorry, I'm being such a girl right now,"" as if it's an inherently feminine thing to cry and express emotions?",16,1743430474.0,RomanceBooks,6,0.94,False
