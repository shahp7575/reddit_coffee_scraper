1qr1p2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1qr1p2i/gaggia_classic_e24_quality_assurance_issues/,Gaggia Classic E24 - Quality assurance issues?,"Can I get some honest feedback on the overall quality of the Gaggia Classic (E24)?

I’m not referring to its ability to pull excellent shots. It can. That’s the main selling point of the GC.

I’m asking because, since the end of July 2025, I’ve owned two different machines.

First machine:

When I bought the GC (e24) in July, I was hooked on the coffee I could make. I’m not exaggerating when I say it was better than what I get at most cafe's.

After 3 months, my experience changed abruptly when the power switch stopped working. To me, that pointed to quality control issues at Gaggia.

When I got the machine back, the power switch worked, but the repair also damaged the steam valve. After they fixed that, they returned the machine with a dent and a scratch. I demanded a full refund, and I got it.

In total: 90 days of ownership, 60 days in the shop.

Second machine:

On January 3, I bought a new GC E24. It initially worked even better than the one it replaced. There was no dripping from the steam wand, and the milk texture was excellent. Then, about 3 weeks in, it stopped frothing properly. The pressure seems to have dropped. I can still steam milk and the drinks are still good, but the steam performance has dropped dramatically. It’s been less than a month.

So now it looks like I’ll have to send another GC back to the service center.

Is this normal? People always say the GC is great because it’s easy to repair. But what good is that if it’s constantly going back for service? Does Gaggia have serious quality control issues, or have I just had really bad luck?",1,1769768320.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

On my iPhone, opening Notion, waiting for the workspace to load, finding my 'Inbox' database, and clicking 'New' takes an average of 6.4 seconds. It sounds fast, but for a quick thought in the street, it’s an eternity. Most of the time, I just give up and the idea is gone. I'm a dev and I was fed up, so I built a bypass.

The setup:

1) A lightweight PWA (web-app) that stays in my dock.

2) It loads in under 0.5s.

3) I type, I hit enter, and a backend function (Vercel + AI) sends the note exactly where it belongs in Notion/Obsidian. 

The Magic part:  I don't even categorize. I just write 'Buy milk tomorrow' or 'Project idea: Coffee SaaS' and the AI tags it and routes it to the right database automatically. I’ve been using it for a week and I’m capturing 3x more ideas simply because the friction is gone.

I’m thinking about opening a few spots for a private beta to see if it holds up for others. If you’re also struggling with 'mobile app fatigue', I'd love to hear how you deal with it (or if you want to help me test this).",1,1769768318.0,Notion,0,1.0,False

Had an oopsie in the kitchen: The filter holder overflowed when we forgot to put in the carafe. My wife went to wipe it up but got an electric shock (220v here in Sweden so it hurt quite a bit - grounded outlets ofc). Immediately thereafter the machine started producing the acrid smoke of burning electronics so my wife unplugged it and threw it outside in the snow.

I called my electrician and asked about this (I was worried the ground wasn't working) and he told me it's because the manufacturers needlessly puts in overly complicated circuit boards so that they can have capacitive buttons and other useless things that are much better off and safer being ""analogue"". The circuit breaker wouldn't trip until the fire was a bit further along causing a complete failure - oftentimes enough current goes through the correct paths that it's not enough for a circuit breaker trip immediately. He was of the opinion that a coffee machine should handle a bit of overflow without starting a fire in the circuit boards though. Good old bi-metallic strips and analogue switches should be enough for most heaters.

The capacitive buttons wilfa puts in these are totally impractical in a kitchen too, since I often have wet fingers when pushing the button. It sits just next to and on level with the carafe heater too.

1qr1ijr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sylvox/comments/1qr1ijr/super_bowl_party_ideas_how_to_host_a_tailgate/,Super Bowl Party Ideas: How to Host a Tailgate Party at Home,"Hosting a tailgate-style Super Bowl party at home works best when you plan for clear sightlines, easy movement, and food that doesn't pull people away from the game. The strongest super bowl party ideas focus on layout, screen placement, and crowd flow—especially when turning a super bowl house party into an indoor-outdoor setup with a Sylvox outdoor TV for sports that keeps the viewing experience smooth and immersive.

When you're the host, a well-set space keeps the night running smoothly without constant direction. This guide walks through how to plan food, decor, seating, lighting, and game day setup so the screen stays the focus from kickoff to the final whistle and the entire night feels effortless.

# Super Bowl Party Ideas for Decorations

**Theme clarity**: Pick one visual idea and repeat it across spaces.

Choose either team colors or a neutral football theme, then apply it consistently to three elements—table surface, drinkware, and one vertical surface. This keeps décor readable without filling the space and helps the room feel relaxed.

**Large-format accents**: Use items people notice from across the room.

Fabric banners, outdoor flags, or chalkboard signs work better than small tabletop props. They reinforce the tailgate feel while staying out of traffic areas.

**Functional placement**: Let décor guide movement.

Place signage near entries and food zones so guests instinctively know where to go next. Good décor doubles as navigation.

# Super Bowl Party Food Ideas

**Two serving windows**: Plan food around game timing.

Put hot food out shortly before kickoff and refresh once during halftime. Everything else should hold up without constant attention, so you're not tied to reheating or plating once the game is underway.

**Hold temperature:**

Slow cookers, covered chafing dishes, or insulated foil trays keep food warm without drying it out, so dishes stay ready between drives.

**One-hand foods**:

Wraps, sliders, wings, skewers, and shareable trays work best—guests can grab and eat without sitting down or juggling plates

**Sauce-first labeling**: Speed up decisions.

Label flavors—""Spicy,"" ""Smoky,"" ""Classic."" Guests choose faster and lines move naturally.

# What Are Some Fun Super Bowl Party Games

**Passive participation**: Games should run alongside the broadcast.

Printable Super Bowl squares posted near high-traffic areas stay visible without pulling attention from the screen.

**Commercial-based prompts**: Keep non-fans engaged.

Simple bingo cards focused on ad themes or moments work during breaks and reset attention before the game resumes.

**Pre-game only activities**: Use physical games as warm-up.

Light toss games or quick challenges belong before kickoff, then clear the area so viewing space stays open.

# Unique Football Party Ideas for Indoor-Outdoor Spaces

**Mirrored viewing**: Extend the game outside.

Placing a [Sylvox weatherproof TV for backyard](https://sylvoxtv.com/pages/2026-game-day-sale) use early allows guests to spread out while keeping the game in view during a backyard Super Bowl party. If you're planning to make that setup part of your regular outdoor space—not just for game day—integrating an outdoor TV into a low-maintenance outdoor living space keeps the setup clean and easy to live with year-round.

And with Super Bowl night often getting chilly after dark, it helps to know can you leave a TV outside in the cold before making it a permanent part of your setup. Many hosts prefer leaving their outdoor TV mounted year-round. Sylvox models built to handle rain, dust, and cold weather remove the need for seasonal setup and keep the experience seamless from one season to the next.

**Single circulation loop**: Design one clear movement path.

Guests should move from drinks to food to seating without doubling back. Open doors early so indoor and outdoor areas feel connected.

**Consistent audio**: Keep reactions in sync.

Matching sound levels across zones helps the entire group respond together, even when split between spaces.

# How to Make the Screen Your Party Centerpiece

**Screen size first**: Go bigger than you think.

In a game day party setup, a larger screen simply reads better in a backyard tailgate setting. For most backyard Super Bowl parties, a 65–75 inch outdoor TV gives enough scale for guests watching from different distances without forcing everyone to crowd the same spot, creating a more immersive viewing experience.

**Screen height**: Optimize for mixed standing and seating.

Position the TV slightly above seated eye level so standing guests don't block views.

**Clear viewing lane**: Protect the sightline.

Leave at least six feet of open space in front of the screen. No tables, no décor, no foot traffic.

**Unified orientatio**n: Keep screens aligned.

If using multiple displays, angle them in the same direction to avoid split attention and delayed reactions.

# Seating That Works for a Crowd

**Tiered seating mix**: Let guests self-select comfort.

Combine sofas, stools, folding chairs, and benches so people naturally find their spot.

**Rear elevation**: Improve visibility for everyone.

Place taller seating toward the back. This matters most when using the best tv for sports watching in a crowded space.

**Outdoor arcs**: Encourage conversation without blocking views.

Arrange outdoor chairs in shallow curves facing the screen so guests can talk without turning away.

https://preview.redd.it/57xe0itynggg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17cbc80fa5d5628efc67a82a492dd232affd9163

# Lighting That Keeps the Game Clear

**Indirect illumination**: Light the space, not the screen.

Use lamps, wall lights, or string lights placed behind seating zones.

**Subtle accents**: Add atmosphere without distraction.

Outdoor RGB strips under steps or railings work best on low saturation, steady settings.

**Screen-first priority**: Eliminate forward glare.

Any light facing the TV should be dimmed or turned off before kickoff. For afternoon kickoffs, a[ brighter outdoor screen](https://sylvoxtv.com/collections/full-sun-outdoor-tv) keeps the action easy to follow, so people stay locked in instead of moving around to find a better angle—something hosts tend to notice quickly when using a Sylvox outdoor TV in mixed daylight conditions.

# Home Game Day Sound System Tips

**Forward sound projection**: Match audio to viewing direction.

Place speakers slightly behind the main seating area so sound travels toward the screen—especially when using a Sylvox outdoor soundbar in open-air setups for clearer dialogue and a more effortless listening experience.

**Dialogue clarity**: Tune for commentary, not volume.

Test levels with commercials to avoid sudden spikes during the game.

**Outdoor balance**: Prevent echo between zones.

Align delay settings so cheers and calls stay synchronized.

# Separate Social Zones Around the Screen

**Zone separation**: Keep social areas off-axis.

Place drink and snack stations to the sides so people don't gather directly in front of the screen.

**Standing buffers**: Create casual chat zones.

High tables or counters behind seating let guests talk without blocking views.

**Screen priority**: Design everything around visibility.

This setup works especially well when using the best outdoor tv for football in shared backyard spaces.

# How to Plan the Flow of Your Super Bowl Party

**Three energy peaks**: Structure the night.

\-Kickoff: Food should already be out, and seating settled so the game starts cleanly.

\-Halftime: Shift the mood. Bring lights up a notch, refresh hot food, and let conversation take over while people naturally move and reset.

\-Final quarter: Pull focus back to the screen. Lower ambient lighting again and keep only drinks or light snacks available.

**Late-game engagement**: Save something for the end.

Dessert or a final snack drop keeps attention high when the game tightens.

# Cold-Weather Essentials for a Warm Super Sunday

**Visible warmth**: Make comfort obvious.

Place blankets and heaters where guests can see them without asking.

**Standing-zone heating**: Warm where people gather.

Position heaters near high-traffic or standing areas instead of directly at seating.

**Warm drink cue**: Mark the late-game shift.

Offering a few warm drink options, hot chocolate, coffee, or hot apple cider, naturally cues a slower, settle-in phase and keeps guests comfortable through the final quarter.

A well-run Super Bowl party feels easy because the planning is invisible. Set up the space once, let the game lead the night, and everything else will fall into place.",1,1769767705.0,Sylvox,0,1.0,False
1qr1ii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurs/comments/1qr1ii6/how_to_get_more_bookings_for_your_tours_without/,How to get more bookings for your tours without paid promotion,"Today I want to share my personal experience on how I attract travelers and keep them coming back. I guide people through NYC and hidden spots, and over the years I learned what actually works to fill tours and get repeat bookings. These are lessons from real life, personal experiences.

Highlight the best spots and capture memories

Whenever I take people somewhere I focus on areas that look amazing. I always point out the little details that make the place unique and let them take photos. Once during a street art walk in NYC I showed a hidden mural alley that most tourists never find. Travelers loved it posted it online and within a week I got five new bookings from people who had seen their photos.

Share insights that travelers can’t find online

I always give stories, history or insider knowledge that’s not in guidebooks. For example I tell the history of the Lower East Side and share secret spots for the best bagels and local snacks. Travelers remember this, and one group recommended my tour to three friends visiting NYC resulting in new bookings.

Ask for feedback every time

After every tour I ask what they liked and what I can improve. Once someone suggested a better walking route through SoHo and I implemented it immediately. That small change led to smoother tours, better reviews, and four extra bookings the following month.

Make referrals easy

I always tell travelers to save me as “tour guide” in their phone and share my social handles. One traveler recommended me to three friends visiting NYC the next month, and it became a chain referral. These referrals now account for about 20% of my bookings.

Stay active online

Even though most of my bookings come directly, I share highlights from my tours on Facebook groups like The Travel Diary and Traveling Around the World Group, as well as on platforms like Viator, Airbnb Experiences, and GetYourGuide. Some travelers discover me this way and book after seeing photos from past tours. On average, sharing tour highlights online brings me two to three new bookings per week.

Be personable and approachable

I try to remember names, jokes, and small details about travelers. Once a group mentioned they were coffee lovers so I took them to a hidden café in the East Village during the walk. They remembered it for months shared their experience online and four of their friends booked tours after seeing their posts. Personal touches make a huge difference.

Encourage social sharing

I ask travelers to tag me or share photos on Instagram or Facebook. I even create small hashtags for my tours. It’s free marketing that spreads naturally. One Instagram post from a happy traveler brought me four new bookings the following week.

These seven tips helped me grow my NYC tours steadily without spending a dime on ads. The key is giving value, being memorable, and making it easy for people to tell others about you. Over the past year these strategies have increased my bookings by more than 40%.",1,1769767701.0,Entrepreneurs,0,1.0,False

The friendship started quickly but we bonded super fast over our birthdays being 6 days apart. And loving all the same things. 

I was currently in a just about 3 year long relationship and P was single. I was in a really shit position not being happy in my relationship and just spending all my time with P. 

I did live with this boyfriend so “escaping” wasn’t always the easiest. But one day I was hanging out with P and told her I was thinking about leaving my bf. She told me to do it and then I asked if she wanted to move in with me once I ended it. She was very excited and said yes. 

It took some time for me to end the relationship because 3 years is a long time along with living with him. I tried my best to make it work but it didn’t. Anyway that’s a story for another time lol. 

After I ended things with my ex I moved in with P and her parents (which wasn’t awkward at all cause her adoptive mom is my step aunt) and I wasn’t going to live there long cause I had a new place ready for us in just a couple weeks. 

While I was living there P met a guy. He seemed nice at first and made her happy so I was happy. But I was going through it. Even though my relationship wasnt good at all I was still sad (like most people are after a breakup) and seeing them happy together made me sad. 

Eventually P and this guy (let’s call him B) did everything together even if me and P only made plans together B would be there. After a while it didn’t bother me too much cause I was over my ex and got my senses together. 

Then they started dating. Me and P moved into a house together and everything was great! Then B started staying the night every night. Coming over to the house when she wasn’t home and basically hogging the house making me feel not welcome in my own home. 

Mind you B has his own place but chose to be at mine all the time. Now the house that I rented for us was only in my name. I know my landlord so there really isn’t a lease for the house but I am the primary renter so P was very lucky by me letting her live there. And that’s why I call it my house. Yes it is her safe space as well and she was paying rent so it was hers too. I do understand that. But I just felt like we had no rules or boundaries. 

P’s bf was really starting to get on my nerves. I felt like he was hiding away my best friend from me. And I do understand getting into a new relationship and it’s fun and exciting and you want to spend a lot of time together. But I felt like I wasn’t seeing her at all AND WE LIVED TOGETHER. I voiced this to P and she apologized and told me we could have a girls night soon. So we did and we watched a movie and ate snack and went shopping. Then after the movie ended someone knocks on the door. Guess who. It’s B. Shocker. He said he wanted to surprise her even though he knew we were having girl time. I was annoyed and just went to my room.

At this point B was really starting to piss me off. He would always joke around with me but like in a rage baiting way and I hated that. Then it turned into him basically living here. He had his own towel on the towel rack (nowhere for mine to go cause P had hers up there too) his toothbrush in the toothbrush holder ( I ain’t putting my toothbrush next to his nasty ass toothbrush) and he would cook food in the oven and then leave the oven on “forgetting to turn it off when his food was done”. 

So I started distancing myself from P because I didn’t feel like she wanted me around. Me and P also worked together so it wasn’t always easy getting my space when we lived and worked together. P was not very good at her job and ended up getting fired. I wasn’t surprised (also givin that my boss told me she was going to) P started working at this job 2 months before me and I was way ahead of her in the job sense before she was. So it just wasn’t a good job for her. 

Anyway. P’s birthday had just happened and mine was a couple days away. I did everything for her birthday. Got her gifts went out with her and everything. 

You know what I got for my birthday. A long text saying that since she had been fired she would be moving out BY TOMORROW. Which tomorrow was my birthday. I was livid. Thanks for the notice. And since like I said there was no lease for the house i am renting she had no obligation to have to stay. But like come on moving out the day after the notice and the day of my birthday. Dick move. 

Me and P went our separate ways and I lived alone for a while. Then I decided to reach out to P to see if she was doing ok. We decided to meet for coffee to discuss. We talked about all our feelings and made up. 

At this point I had met my current loving boyfriend. I was telling P all about him and she was happy for me. P moved into a new place that her and B where going to get together it was about 20 mins out of town. Then as soon as she started the lease for the house B dumped P. They had just had their 1 year anniversary. 

She was devastated so I was there for her as much as possible but I had also just gotten into a relationship at this point so I was being a bit petty and giving her a taste of her own medicine. I know a little childish I can admit. Also my car is a pos and it can’t drive very far and givin I have to drive on a highway to get to P’s house was a bit sketchy to me so I didn’t drive out there much. But my boyfriend goes to college so when he went back after the summer I hung out with P more frequently. We got pretty close again. 

Then she started talking to B again and I was not happy. I was just looking out for my best friend. I told her to be careful and she said she would be. Then he would randomly text her I can’t do this and block her. Then a couple weeks later unblock her and say he misses her. And this was just a reoccurring cycle. This made me angry at B because he was toying with her emotions. And I was a bit frustrated with P cause she kept letting it happen. 

Then she told me they had decided to go to therapy separately to work on themselves and have no contact and see if it would bring them together eventually. I didn’t hate this idea but I hate B. And I also knew from this pattern of them on and off that it wasn’t going to last. I told P I was tired of hearing about B cause she just kept getting hurt and it was frustrating for me to see my best friend hurt over and over again. She told me she wouldn’t talk about him to me anymore but that was a lie and all she did was talk about him. 

A couple days later she came to visit me at work and she was sobbing. She told me that she couldn’t do it anymore with him and it was just getting too complicated and that one of her regulars at work told her that him “accidentally” hitting her was abuse. And she said he was right and that she was scared of him. 

Also a little back track to when they were on and off again the first couple times. B had told her that she was allowed to see other people but she wasn’t allowed to see anyone he knew. He grew up here so he knows everyone. Just like I do. P did not grow up here so she doesn’t really know that many people. How tf is she supposed to know who he does and doesn’t know. 

Anyway so she was crying to me about him so I told her to block him and I eventually convinced her to do it. THE NEXT DAY she texts me and says “oops I failed I unblocked him and we are talking again” I was FURIOUS. I sent out a very big message to P saying that if B was in her life then I couldn’t be. I told her I still love and care for her and I do still want to be friends but I don’t want to hear about him because I know how this is going to end since it’s happened so many time by now. 

She actually took it really well and said she understood and apologized. We hung out a couple times after that and she really didn’t mention B until I brought him up once (my mistake) and then after that she only talked about him. I was so over it at this point and just stopped responding to her texts and cut her out of my life. Oh and her and B are officially back together. We will see if it lasts this time.

1qr160g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qr160g,Grinder keeps clogging and eventually stalls [Fiorenzato F4E Nano],"Hey all,

I’m kind of stuck (literally) with my grinder and hoping someone here has seen this before.

I’m running a **Fiorenzato F4E Nano** and it keeps clogging up at the chute, right around the declumper area. The strange thing is that it doesn’t happen immediately. At first everything works perfectly: the grind size is dialed in, it produces great espresso, and the dose coming out is normal.

Then, shot by shot, less coffee comes out while grounds clearly start building up inside the chute. Eventually it gets completely blocked and the grinder stalls because it can’t push anything through anymore.

I’ve taken the grinder apart and cleaned everything thoroughly, including the chute and declumper, but the issue keeps coming back. I’ve added a few photos so you can see exactly where the grounds get stuck.

At this point I’m a bit out of ideas. Has anyone dealt with this on an F4E Nano or similar Fiorenzato grinders? Any tips on what to look at next would be very welcome.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for monster jam at the amp on saturday 01/31 because parking downtown providence, especially for a huge event like this, can honestly ruin the good vibes when you're trying to leave. the post-show traffic jam from the main garages is legendary in a bad way.  
  
the absolute best way i've found to park is using an app called Prked. it lets you rent a private driveway or garage from someone who lives right next door to the amica mutual pavilion. it's usually way cheaper than the official lots and the biggest benefit is you completely skip the insane traffic snarl of everyone trying to exit the same huge garage after the monster trucks are done. you just walk a minute or two, hop in your car, and you're already on your way home.  
  
if you don't go the Prked route, your next option is the official garages which are right there and connected to the venue and convention center, which is super convenient. you have the north garage (99 west exchange st) for daily parking and the south garage (1 sabin st), though south is mainly for monthly passes and parkwhiz reservations. expect to pay the event rate, which is $25 plus tax. honestly though, on a resale site for monster jam, those official passes are sometimes listed for a lot more, even $35 or higher, so check that before you roll up. the big problem here is leaving- be prepared to wait a long time to get out because hundreds of other cars are all trying to exit at the same time. a pro tip for the official lots is to grab your ticket when you enter and only pay at one of the pay stations in the lobby or garage when you are ready to leave, don't validate it early. also, if you have an ev, there are charging stations in the north garage (level 4) and the south garage (p2 at street level).  
  
another popular and cheaper alternative is the providence place mall garage. some folks say parking there is cheap, maybe around five bucks for a few hours, but prices might change for an event this big. if you park there, you can actually walk through a series of sky bridges to get to the arena without going outside much: mall to the omni hotel, then through the convention center, and finally to the amp. a handy tip in the omni is to stay on the convention center level by taking the hall between the escalator and the coffee counter. even with this lot, expect a long delay trying to get out onto the street when the show is over.  
  
you can also pre-book a spot at one of the dozens of other private lots nearby, which is a good idea to guarantee your space. apps like spothero or parkwhiz let you reserve spots in lots on streets like atwells avenue (38 atwells ave lot), fountain street (209 fountain st empire lot), or lots like the innovation district garage (75 clifford street). these can sometimes be cheaper than the official rate, like $16-$29, but they fill up fast.  
  
whatever you choose, my biggest advice is to get there early. street parking is basically a lost cause right near the arena and i wouldn't even waste time looking. meters are enforced until 9:00 pm on saturdays at $1.25 per hour, so you'd be paying right up until after the show starts. the venue also recommends you plan to arrive earlier than normal for the security screening process which includes metal detectors. if you need to drop someone off, there are no designated areas right at the front, so have your ride aim for a side street near one lasalle square. there are also accessible parking spaces right in front of the amp, first-come-first-serve.  
  
hope this helps everyone get to see the monster trucks smoothly. have a great time at monster jam!",1,1769766451.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I’m a pretty nurturing person and I have a cat who I absolutely adore. I can be a bit introverted and awkward at first, but once I’m comfortable, my extroverted side definitely comes out. I do best with someone who can take the lead early on. Also fair warning, I can be a little clingy too.

I’m looking for something long-term and meaningful. I’m open to long-distance as long as it’s intentional and mature. If we do end up in an LDR, I’d really want consistent FaceTime calls and actual plans to meet, not just endless texting. I’d prefer someone from New Zealand or Australia since I’ve been there many times, but I’m open to other countries if there’s a realistic plan to meet in the future.

I’m drawn to people who are emotionally mature, ambitious, and know what they want. You don’t have to share all my interests, I genuinely believe opposites attract.

1qr13k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qr13k4/how_to_crush_any_interview_the_sciencebased/,How to CRUSH Any Interview: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"so i used to be TERRIBLE at interviews. like sweating through my shirt, word-vomiting nonsense, leaving and immediately wanting to delete myself from existence type terrible. then i spent way too much time researching this (books, psychology podcasts, youtube deep dives, actual interview coaches) because i was tired of fumbling opportunities i was qualified for.

turns out most interview advice is garbage. the ""be yourself"" and ""just relax"" crowd clearly never bombed an interview so badly they considered faking their own death. but there's actually legit psychology and strategy behind crushing interviews that nobody talks about. this isn't about tricking anyone, it's about presenting your actual value without your anxiety sabotaging you.

1. reframe what an interview actually is

stop treating it like a test you can fail. it's a conversation between two parties trying to figure out mutual fit. they WANT you to be good. they're tired of interviewing people. hiring is expensive and annoying. you're potentially solving their problem.

this mental shift alone changes everything. you're not begging for scraps, you're exploring whether this role deserves YOUR time and skills. sounds cocky but it genuinely makes you more attractive as a candidate because desperation is the most repellent thing you can project.

2. research like you're writing their biography

spend at least 2 hours researching before any interview. company website, recent news, their linkedin, glassdoor reviews, their competitors, industry trends. this isn't optional.

then do something most people skip: research the actual humans interviewing you. check their linkedin, see what they post about, find common ground. when you can naturally reference something specific in the interview (""i saw you used to work at X company, i'm really interested in how that industry compares to this one""), it shows effort and creates instant connection.

3. master the STAR method but make it not robotic

situation, task, action, result. for behavioral questions this structure is clutch but everyone uses it so mechanically that it sounds like they're reading a script.

practice your stories but tell them like you're explaining to a friend over coffee. add tiny human details. instead of ""i managed a team of 5 people,"" say ""i was managing this team of 5 and two of them were NOT getting along, like actively avoiding each other in meetings."" makes it real.

prepare 6-8 solid stories that cover different skills, leadership, problem solving, conflict, failure, innovation. you can remix these for most questions.

4. your ""tell me about yourself"" answer needs work

this is the most predictable question and people still mess it up. don't recite your resume. they have that. use this formula:

brief background (10 seconds), why you're passionate about this field (20 seconds), recent relevant accomplishment (20 seconds), why you're excited about THIS role (10 seconds).

should be under 90 seconds total. practice it until it sounds natural, not memorized.

5. flip the script with YOUR questions

at the end when they ask if you have questions, this is not a formality. this is where you either solidify their interest or reveal you don't actually care.

ask stuff that shows strategic thinking: ""what does success look like in this role after 6 months?"" ""what are the biggest challenges the team is facing right now?"" ""how does this role contribute to the company's main objectives this year?""

avoid anything you could google. no ""what does the company do"" type stuff.

one killer question: ""is there anything about my background or experience that gives you concerns about my fit for this role?"" gives you a chance to address doubts in real time instead of wondering later what went wrong.

6. body language is doing half the talking

sit up straight but not weirdly rigid. make consistent eye contact (look away occasionally so you're not a psycho). smile when appropriate. nod while they're talking to show engagement.

match their energy somewhat. if they're more formal, dial yourself back. if they're relaxed and joking, you can loosen up too.

and for the love of god, don't fidget with pens or touch your face constantly. if you need something to do with your hands, rest them on the table or use small purposeful gestures when talking.

7. the pause is your friend

when they ask a tough question, it's completely fine to pause for 3-5 seconds before answering. shows you're thoughtful. rushed answers sound defensive or unprepared.

if you genuinely don't know something, don't try to BS your way through. ""that's not something i've dealt with directly, but here's how i'd approach it"" is way better than making up experience.

8. strategic vulnerability is powerful

when they ask about weaknesses (they will), pick something real but not disqualifying. then immediately talk about how you're actively working on it with specific examples.

""i used to struggle with delegating because i wanted everything done my way, but i've been intentionally giving team members more ownership and the results have actually been better than when i tried to control everything.""

shows self awareness and growth, not just humblebragging disguised as a weakness.

9. send the follow up email within 24 hours

short, specific, professional. thank them for their time, reference something specific from your conversation, reiterate your interest, keep it under 150 words.

this seems basic but tons of people skip it or send some generic template. personalization matters.

10. practice out loud with someone

reading interview tips is cool. actually practicing responses out loud is what makes you good. it feels awkward but it's the difference between knowing what to say and actually being able to say it under pressure.

get a friend to ask you common questions. record yourself on your phone. watch it back and cringe at your filler words and weird pauses. then do it again until it's smoother.

couple resources that actually helped: ""The Interview Question and Answer Book"" by James Reed is packed with practical frameworks, not just feel good nonsense. for understanding the psychology behind what interviewers are really assessing, Laszlo Bock's ""Work Rules!"" gives great insight (he was head of people operations at google for a decade).

there's also this youtube channel called ""A Life After Layoff"" that breaks down behavioral interview questions in a really practical way. the host is a former corporate recruiter so he knows what actually matters vs what's just noise.

if you want something more structured, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls insights from career development books, psychology research, and expert interviews to build personalized learning plans. you can tell it something like ""help me prepare for leadership interviews"" or ""improve my communication under pressure,"" and it creates an adaptive plan with podcasts customized to your depth preference, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. the content connects a lot of the dots between books like the ones mentioned above, plus research on communication psychology and confidence building. worth checking out if you learn better by audio during commutes or workouts.

one last thing: you're gonna bomb interviews sometimes even when you do everything right. the fit wasn't there, someone internal got it, budget changed, whatever. doesn't mean you suck at interviews. means that specific thing wasn't meant to work out. review what you could improve and move forward.

but when you nail one, when you leave feeling like you just had an engaging conversation instead of a interrogation, when they're clearly impressed and you're genuinely excited about the role, that feeling is unmatched. interviews can actually be enjoyable once you stop seeing them as something to survive and start seeing them as a chance to showcase what you bring to the table.",1,1769766246.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

1qr1247,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceindia/comments/1qr1247/the_cost_of_comparison_in_the_age_of_social_media/,The Cost of Comparison in the Age of Social Media,"As a society, we often encourage modesty, yet social media has pushed us toward constant display—expensive vacations, luxury purchases, fine dining, and curated success. What this culture forgets is that **everyone’s starting point in life is different**, and comparison rarely reflects reality.

We cannot blame individuals for financial struggles without understanding their circumstances. Humans are among the most dependent beings on Earth—we often need over 22 years of parental support to become independent. Not everyone is born into stability or wealth. Some are forced to take different paths because they must repay parental debt, support siblings’ education or marriages, or simply survive without a safety net.

Meanwhile, others are born with wealth and unlimited options at every stage of life. For the majority, choices are limited. These paths may not be ideal, but they are often the only viable ones. That’s why comparing two people—or even two siblings—is deeply unfair. Childhood exposure, resources, and emotional environments differ drastically and shape decisions in ways largely outside individual control.

Social media intensifies this imbalance by showing only the highlights of life. Rarely do people share the debt, anxiety, or sacrifices behind the success. This selective visibility quietly reshapes behavior and self-worth.

When someone posts about a purchase, trip, or achievement, it usually affects their audience in one of four ways:

1. **Some people try it because it’s genuinely affordable for them.**
2. **Some try it by stretching themselves into debt.**
3. **A small group feels happy for the person’s success or achievement.**
4. **For others, it creates envy, longing, or quiet dissatisfaction because it’s completely unaffordable.**

If your social circle mostly falls into categories **1 and 3**, posting may not harm anyone. But that’s rarely the case. We need to pause and think about the remaining groups—especially those pushed toward debt or emotional distress. How does repeated exposure affect *their* mental health, financial stability, and sense of self?

I remember my father saying that even the wealthiest families in his village would serve something as simple as coffee at weddings, despite owning more gold than today’s middle-class families. Wealth didn’t need performance. Today, however, peer pressure has redefined celebration. People spend excessively on events labeled “once in a lifetime,” often far beyond their means, accumulating debt at the very start of adulthood.

We are increasingly using every opportunity to *look* rich rather than focusing on *being* financially secure.

Many buy things they cannot afford through EMIs just to impress people they don’t even like. Social media fuels this cycle through validation-seeking and FOMO. Over time, it creates a spending bubble. When people can no longer keep up—even with credit—the comparison turns inward, often leading to stress, regret, and depression.

FOMO itself isn’t always harmful—if it pushes us toward growth, learning, or better habits. But when it drives reckless spending and constant self-comparison, it does far more harm than good.

So the real question isn’t *whether* posting success is wrong—it’s **whether we are mindful of how uneven the impact can be**, especially in a world where most people are already navigating life with limited choices.",3,1769766098.0,personalfinanceindia,0,1.0,False
1qr11wg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qr11wg,"The S12 Ultra: Safe, consistent and a smooth operator","First things first, a huge vote of thanks to Sushii Audio ( [u/Gaming\_Sushii](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gaming_Sushii/) ) for making this review possible by loaning me the S12 Ultra from Shuoer in its full packaging. 

Shuoer has been churning a few planar sets and their S12 lineup has had critical acclaim for being a well rounded product to most, but also received critique and notes of improvement for further refinement of the highly technical sound that they are fabled for, and today in my hands I have the S12 Ultra and this review shall reflect my happiness in reviewing this wonderful planar set.

Unpacking the S12 Ultra felt professional- no annoying waifu branding, clear advertisement of the product Shuoer is offering, minimal graphics and as I lift the lid, it feels familiar- the S12 ultras sitting in the foam laden compartment and below that, a screwdown circular case that houses the cable which is modular and feels premium- the connectors are locked via a screw mechanism, 2 sets of grey and clear silicone eartips that actually are decent but the most welcoming element in here was the inclusion of a CX31993 chipped DT-01 pro dac from Shuoer. For my casual usage, this dac powered the iems good enough but I focus primarily on the IEMs themselves but for people who actually want an all inclusive package in a reasonable price, the inclusion of this dac with the S12 ultra is a welcome step from Shuoer.

**Impressions of sound are free of any EQ or colouring, nor have I used EQ in my personal usage of this set.**

Enough talk, here is the sound:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Lows:** the S12 ultra has a smooth yet powerful presentation in the sub-bass and quite prominently so. It reaches deep, the impact is bold and powerful but a little more sustenance would not have hurt and this was uniform no matter which eartips I used. It does have a groveling rumbling delivery but all I wanted was to sustain it a bit more and bring it home.

tracks like Daft Punk’s *Get Lucky, Instant Crush* and Rush’s *Limelight*, the S12 ultra has a restrained yet meticulous painting in terms of delivering detail where I could distinctly hear the plucking and the switcheroo of notes as the tracks progressed and the S12 ultra held its composure through the busy sections with relative ease. Things got more enjoyable as the kick drums and toms actually saw more life in Limelight where the groveling bass notes felt coherent with how the drums were reacting, creating a very promising synchronised effort into keeping the sound fun.

Again, I would have appreciated a bit more reach in making the delivery very powerful but for those who are looking for a bass that does not hurt yet remains plenty enough in quality and quantity, the S12 ultra here is a very strong recommendation.

**Mids:** Even here, this set continues to impress me and much more than its predecessors, specially the S12 Pro where it just felt like the valley has flooded and sunk into obscurity, the S12 ultra instead with its wider stage, great instrument separation and imaging restores the same sunken valley into its past glory.

In tracks like The Police’s *Message in a Bottle* and Tool’s *Pneuma*, the S12 Ultra behaved in a calm, composed manner and did not show overenthusiasm in delivering both the vocals and the rest of the elements together. As I spent more time with this set, I realised that the vocals do not feel as laid back as they were initially observed and that it carries within itself a good amount of energy into bringing it to the forefront yet just stops shy of being too on the nose. 

Tonality remains consistent although sometimes perceived to be minutely dry, as I could feel through the cymbals on *Pneuma* but what made me like the S12 ultra so much was that timbre despite being a planar felt very natural, while separation once again was commendable.

**Highs:** This is where the S12 Ultra sets itself apart from its predecessors and for a good reason, it's super smooth for the good part and it rises through peaks in vocals very well which I observed in tracks like Adele's Easy On Me and Celine Dion’s All By Myself where I never felt even for a moment that I observed shrillness and pierce even when the tracks had their climactic highs. Once again, vocals even with the dynamics and vibratos were very natural and lush in their tonality, and timbre once again remained intact.

In tracks like Kendrick Lamar’s Alright, the horns and cymbals had beautiful coherence and the timbre of the horns especially stayed true in its nature, while carrying a good amount of weight. However, the background vocals felt slightly obscure as the S12 Ultra handled the clipper cymbals like it should and being on the beat.

**Concluding notes:** the S12 Ultra I feel, is Shuoer’s actual home run in its line-up and giving the market a planar that can handle all genres without distinction and is a safe bet for something that has everything premium, even the sound. Adding a healthy assortment of stock eartips that surprisingly sound decent, with their DT01 pro dac that performs decent and supplies this IEM with enough power and a well built cable with modular jacks sweetens the deal so good that it's a great starting point without any concerning compromises where I feel you don't need to buy anything else with it.

However, the S12 Ultra felt itself playing too safe if I had to compare it with one of my favourite planar IEMs of all time, the Tangzu Zetian Wu Heyday where the Heyday had so much energy through the lows which could be described as controlled chaos in the best, and even though the Heyday has a comparatively narrower stage, it carries in itself considerably more detail while showing the market that a good tuning remains good despite changing and evolving market trends. The S12 ultra has a remarkable control over the sound which does not discriminate across genres, but if folks like a brighter sound and retain the planar bass, my choice would be the Heyday over the Ultra.

The S12 ultra actually felt a step above compared to sets like the Crinear Daybreak as the bass on the S12 Ultra came off as plenty without overdoing it which was a problem on the Daybreak and when I compare it to the Lush, the S12 feels brighter and slightly fatiguing where the Lush felt safer and smoother. But if you were to ask me, if I didn't have the Heyday I would be seeing myself as an owner of the S12 Ultra alongside my Lush and with that, I give the S12 Ultra an A+

1qr112m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india_tourism/comments/1qr112m/my_kinda_solo_travel_the_alemaari_way/,My Kinda Solo Travel: The Alemaari Way,"Last Thursday. Got a call from an agency some vague company. ""Come to Bangalore, give an interview, get a job."" Asked them point-blank: ""Is this a scam?"" They denied it. Home is 300-400 kilometers away, but boredom had set in after months of unemployment. Decided to give it a shot.

Money was the issue. Had maybe a 1000 rupees in savings, just loose change. Mother pitched in another 500. ""Go and come,"" she said. Warned her it might be a scam. She knew. ""Just go refresh your mind.""

Boarded a late-night train. Stopped by my sister’s place first surprisingly, she handed over a thousand and change. Another sister chipped in 500. Suddenly, the budget was around 3,000. Mood lifted. Thought, why not roam around another city? If the interview goes south, whatever.

Sister insisted on a better seat. ""Don't go general berth, it stinks. Sleep well, dress well."" She booked it. Side lower. Woke up at 7 AM at KSR Bangalore.

Freshened up at a public toilet (train washroom was dry and stinging) and took the metro to the prescribed location. No breakfast, just coffee.
98% sure it was a scam, but went anyway. Hall was full of bakras waiting for an opportunity. The interviewer spoke 2x speed English, pretending to be the Queen. ""You have to pay 1,500 rupees for an exam.""

""Why? You didn't mention this.""

""HR's problem.""

Shouted at them. Told them to stop running a racket. Realized quickly this wasn't the place. Walked out. Called the HR, gave them an earful. Too many goons around to do much else.

Stomach was rumbling, so forgot about filing a complaint. Still you ask why go knowing it’s a scam? Love to travel. With that extra cash from the sisters, the plan shifted. Kashi. Varanasi. With 3,000 rupees? Definitely happening.

Had breakfast, roamed Chikpet for thirty minutes(don't know why did I go to chikpet), then back to KSR station.

Chaos at the station. Crowds were waiting for the Bagmati Express-hundreds of people headed toward Bihar, UP, and MP. It was too intimidating to try boarding mid-route. Checked other stations like SMVT and Yeshwantpur, but found nothing. Tried if i could get down and catch other trains at Jabalpur or Nagpur also. Considered every other possible route: Mysore, Chennai, or even Hyderabad. Finally decided on Hyderabad. It was 500 kilometers away, but there was a train to Danapur leaving from Secunderabad the next morning. It felt like the only move left, so I went for it.

The trains were full, so I headed straight to Kempegowda Bus Station. Found a semi-sleeper bound for Hyderabad. The driver wanted 1,000 rupees. Steep. It was already 1:15 PM and he said the bus was leaving at 1:30 PM sharp. I told him, 'I’ll be back.'

You might think I was standing there in deep thought, debating whether to board or not because of the price. But I didn't waste a second on 'thinking.' I utilized those fifteen minutes to hit the loo, grab two packets of chips, a water bottle, and some juice. I walked straight back, paid the cash, and sat down. That was it. No hesitation just going with the flow.

Bus left from Bangalore soon in Chikkaballpura new place new landscape. First time crossing into Andhra Pradesh that way. Skipped lunch to save money. Reached Kurnool at night. Driver wouldn't stop near a washroom, pointed to the bushes. ""Go there."" Fine. Did it in the bushes.

Entered Hyderabad at 2:00 AM. Good looking city. Reached the bus stand, navigated the Telugu signboards (thankfully similar to Kannada but not all words), and took a bus to Secunderabad.

Secunderabad at 3:45 AM is next level. People sleeping on the ground, police waking them up with batons. Ticket collector suggested buying a general ticket and sleeping in the sleeper berth until fined.

""Can I travel after the fine in sleeper?"" Silence.

Tense. Confused. Met a nice elderly couple, chatted for a while.
Considered hitchhiking. Scoured Reddit, blogs, YouTube. Stories about organ trafficking and the organ mafia in the middle belt killed that idea fast.

Still

Boarded a bus toward the Nagpur highway, walked 2 km, tried to flag down vehicles. No luck. Just rickshaws. Morale low. Made the hard call: Kashi plan dropped. Money too tight, no contacts.

Breakfast on the highway idli and vada. Didn't brush, just washed face. Alemaari me being just too lazy.

Decided to explore historic Hyderabad instead. Took my first Hyderabad metro ride from Secunderabad to the main bus stand, and from there, headed to Charminar. Good vibes all around. I bought two bottles of Attar for 50 rupees each-the only shopping I did the entire trip.

I called my mother to ask if she wanted any bangles. She said, 'Yes, if you have the money.' I was about to buy them, but then I realized they’d probably break inside my bag during the rough travel ahead. It felt like a waste of money to risk it, so I decided against it. Practicality won over sentiment.

North was canceled, so looked East and West. South where I was already from. Vishakhapatnam? Chennai? Too far. Goa? Been there recently, but why not.

Found a train to Hubli leaving Nampalli at 3:50 PM. There were no trains available to Goa at the moment, so Hubli was the move. When the ticket counter opened, the clerk told me to come back at 2:00 PM for the booking. Asked if I could wait inside the station in the meantime; he said no unless I had a platform ticket.

So, spent 10 rupees on a platform ticket and just chilled for two hours. Sat there charging my phone, staring at the empty train compartments, completely lost in my own world. It was a hell of a vibe. Around 1:30 PM, had some lunch, bought the official ticket at 2:00, and headed to the train. Managed to sleep for an hour before the crowds started pouring in that was the final goodbye to Hyderabad.

Later in the journey, spotted an empty upper berth in the next compartment. 'Anyone here, Amma?' I asked a lady nearby. 'No,' she said. Moved the bags, found a good quiet space to sleep overnight, and didn't wake up until reaching Hubli at 5:00 AM.

Hubli station is massive. Maybe the biggest platform in India. Exited, found the bus stand 5 km away. Auto driver fellow Kannadiga Halkat nan maga charged 200 rupees. Blood boiled, but paid it.

Managed to squeeze onto the Vasco-bound bus, which was heading via Ponda. Even though it was packed, I grabbed a seat. The plan was to get down at Ponda and head to Madgaon, aiming for the 2:00 PM passenger train back to my native place. The bus was painfully slow, but it led to an interesting encounter. 

My co-passenger was from Jharkhand. When he said he was from Dhanbad, I asked, 'Achha, Wasseypur bhi paas padta hai na?' He was shocked I knew the reference. We had a great conversation; he was headed to Goa for work but refused to call himself a 'worker.' He teased me instead, saying, 'Then you’re a slave, bro a corporate one.' We shared some fine banter about life and the internet before parting ways at Ponda. His parting words stuck with me: 'Duniya choti hai dost, agar kismet hui toh milenge dobara' (The world is small, friend; if it's meant to be, we'll meet again).

Treat meal in Margao. Roamed too long, missed the train. Classic. Haha. Yes I was all around in madgaon that I forgot had to catch a train.(Spent too much time sitting in park).

The plan was to catch the same train from Karwar, but the bus from Goa was crawling. Between the slow speed and a time-consuming security checkpoint, I missed the train at Karwar too. At that point, I gave up on the tracks. Despite having other train options, I chose the bus. I don’t even know why, I just did. I treated myself to another masala dosa in Karwar, and by then it was already around 4:35 PM.

The conductor told me there were no direct buses to my native place and suggested going to Kumta instead. I reached Kumta around 7:00 PM and waited an hour. The station office kept delaying, saying the bus would arrive in fifteen minutes, then another half hour. 

At Kumta, I met an interesting old man while waiting. He had been standing there for a long time, waiting for his bus to Bangalore. Every few minutes, he checked his phone messages kept coming in, each saying the bus was delayed again. He blamed the system, the government, the general incompetence of it all. I listened, shared a small counter-view, and he took it in with mixed reactions.

Eventually, he asked where I was headed and why I was traveling alone. I told him I was traveling for fun, though I briefly mentioned the interview. He laughed and asked why I was moving in circles instead of taking a direct route. The question wasn’t judgmental just practical, very him. I didn’t stretch the conversation. It stayed short, honest, and to the point. That felt right.

By 8:00 PM, I’d had enough and boarded a bus to Bhatkal. The stretch from Karwar to Kumta had been hectic and overcrowded, but the ride to Bhatkal was surprisingly smooth, arriving there around 9:30 PM.

At 10:15 PM, the bus to my hometown arrived. It was incredibly crowded. The women at the back refused to move forward, insisting they were getting off at the 'next stop.' It was a mess, but I found it interesting. I could have slept at the bus stand, but chose the chaos and squeezed in anyway. Was literally hanging off the last step until the crowd thinned out a few stops later and finally snagged a seat.

I woke up at my hometown bus station at 1:30 AM just in time. If I hadn’t woken up at that exact second, would have ended up at the final depot miles away. Headed straight to the seating section where dozens of people were sleeping on the floor and benches. I used my bag as a pillow and passed out. At 4:15 AM sharp, woke to the sound of a policeman waking everyone up. By 4:45 AM, was on the first bus toward my house. By 5:35 AM, I was sitting in a local hotel eating idli, and by 5:45 AM, was finally home. Took a great bath after all the journey. That's my Alemaari story.


My travel is about observation. Perception. Perspectives. Hate crowded tourist spots. Prefer the randomness. Life is a psychological pattern.

Like to live as a wanderer. An Alemaari. That’s the philosophy. Peace out.

This my first time posting here, so I hope people will help correct me if I don't say something the right way. I'm nervous

Ok, the first thing is I am gynemimetophilia (attracted to both woman and transgender females). In the past I have had some experience with transgender females, but not a relationship. 

I met a transgender female a few weeks ago and we met up once for coffee and then we went to dinner. Both of us had a good time and we hugged each other when the night was over and we each went home.

We have been talking about getting together this weekend and went back and forth with some ideas. She invited me to a gay spa. I've never went to one before and don't really know what to expect. I've been to a ""regular"" spa here in the country I live in (I'm in Asia, but I am from the US) and the men and women are separated. 

First question is should I take it that she really likes me enough to go somewhere naked together? Second, I know in gay spas that the spa is just part of what takes place there. I read a review for the spa and it says there are some areas that are for couples to be intimate. I don't know how to interpret that she would invited me to something like this so quickly. I honestly am a bit shocked. 

Any advice or calming words would be appreciated.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The salty breeze carried whispers of a story, and with every breath, I embraced the challenge of crafting an acrostic that encapsulated the essence of my journey.

For a thousand words, I embarked on a reflective exploration, utilizing the initial letters of key words to weave a tapestry of emotions, experiences, and revelations. Each line unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1qr0v2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoloTravel_India/comments/1qr0v2f/my_kinda_solo_travel_the_alemaari_way/,My Kinda Solo Travel: The Alemaari Way,"Last Thursday. Got a call from an agency some vague company. ""Come to Bangalore, give an interview, get a job."" Asked them point-blank: ""Is this a scam?"" They denied it. Home is 300-400 kilometers away, but boredom had set in after months of unemployment. Decided to give it a shot.

Money was the issue. Had maybe a 1000 rupees in savings, just loose change. Mother pitched in another 500. ""Go and come,"" she said. Warned her it might be a scam. She knew. ""Just go refresh your mind.""

Boarded a late-night train. Stopped by my sister’s place first surprisingly, she handed over a thousand and change. Another sister chipped in 500. Suddenly, the budget was around 3,000. Mood lifted. Thought, why not roam around another city? If the interview goes south, whatever.

Sister insisted on a better seat. ""Don't go general berth, it stinks. Sleep well, dress well."" She booked it. Side lower. Woke up at 7 AM at KSR Bangalore.

Freshened up at a public toilet (train washroom was dry and stinging) and took the metro to the prescribed location. No breakfast, just coffee.
98% sure it was a scam, but went anyway. Hall was full of bakras waiting for an opportunity. The interviewer spoke 2x speed English, pretending to be the Queen. ""You have to pay 1,500 rupees for an exam.""

""Why? You didn't mention this.""

""HR's problem.""

Shouted at them. Told them to stop running a racket. Realized quickly this wasn't the place. Walked out. Called the HR, gave them an earful. Too many goons around to do much else.

Stomach was rumbling, so forgot about filing a complaint. Still you ask why go knowing it’s a scam? Love to travel. With that extra cash from the sisters, the plan shifted. Kashi. Varanasi. With 3,000 rupees? Definitely happening.

Had breakfast, roamed Chikpet for thirty minutes(don't know why did I go to chikpet), then back to KSR station.

Chaos at the station. Crowds were waiting for the Bagmati Express-hundreds of people headed toward Bihar, UP, and MP. It was too intimidating to try boarding mid-route. Checked other stations like SMVT and Yeshwantpur, but found nothing. Tried if i could get down and catch other trains at Jabalpur or Nagpur also. Considered every other possible route: Mysore, Chennai, or even Hyderabad. Finally decided on Hyderabad. It was 500 kilometers away, but there was a train to Danapur leaving from Secunderabad the next morning. It felt like the only move left, so I went for it.

The trains were full, so I headed straight to Kempegowda Bus Station. Found a semi-sleeper bound for Hyderabad. The driver wanted 1,000 rupees. Steep. It was already 1:15 PM and he said the bus was leaving at 1:30 PM sharp. I told him, 'I’ll be back.'

​You might think I was standing there in deep thought, debating whether to board or not because of the price. But I didn't waste a second on 'thinking.' I utilized those fifteen minutes to hit the loo, grab two packets of chips, a water bottle, and some juice. I walked straight back, paid the cash, and sat down. That was it. No hesitation just going with the flow.

Bus left from Bangalore soon in Chikkaballpura new place new landscape. First time crossing into Andhra Pradesh that way. Skipped lunch to save money. Reached Kurnool at night. Driver wouldn't stop near a washroom, pointed to the bushes. ""Go there."" Fine. Did it in the bushes.

Entered Hyderabad at 2:00 AM. Good looking city. Reached the bus stand, navigated the Telugu signboards (thankfully similar to Kannada but not all words), and took a bus to Secunderabad.

Secunderabad at 3:45 AM is next level. People sleeping on the ground, police waking them up with batons. Ticket collector suggested buying a general ticket and sleeping in the sleeper berth until fined.

""Can I travel after the fine in sleeper?"" Silence.

Tense. Confused. Met a nice elderly couple, chatted for a while.
Considered hitchhiking. Scoured Reddit, blogs, YouTube. Stories about organ trafficking and the organ mafia in the middle belt killed that idea fast.

Still

Boarded a bus toward the Nagpur highway, walked 2 km, tried to flag down vehicles. No luck. Just rickshaws. Morale low. Made the hard call: Kashi plan dropped. Money too tight, no contacts.

Breakfast on the highway idli and vada. Didn't brush, just washed face. Alemaari me being just too lazy.

Decided to explore historic Hyderabad instead. Took my first Hyderabad metro ride from Secunderabad to the main bus stand, and from there, headed to Charminar. Good vibes all around. I bought two bottles of Attar for 50 rupees each-the only shopping I did the entire trip.

​I called my mother to ask if she wanted any bangles. She said, 'Yes, if you have the money.' I was about to buy them, but then I realized they’d probably break inside my bag during the rough travel ahead. It felt like a waste of money to risk it, so I decided against it. Practicality won over sentiment.

North was canceled, so looked East and West. South where I was already from. Vishakhapatnam? Chennai? Too far. Goa? Been there recently, but why not.

Found a train to Hubli leaving Nampalli at 3:50 PM. There were no trains available to Goa at the moment, so Hubli was the move. When the ticket counter opened, the clerk told me to come back at 2:00 PM for the booking. Asked if I could wait inside the station in the meantime; he said no unless I had a platform ticket.

So, spent 10 rupees on a platform ticket and just chilled for two hours. Sat there charging my phone, staring at the empty train compartments, completely lost in my own world. It was a hell of a vibe. Around 1:30 PM, had some lunch, bought the official ticket at 2:00, and headed to the train. Managed to sleep for an hour before the crowds started pouring in that was the final goodbye to Hyderabad.

Later in the journey, spotted an empty upper berth in the next compartment. 'Anyone here, Amma?' I asked a lady nearby. 'No,' she said. Moved the bags, found a good quiet space to sleep overnight, and didn't wake up until reaching Hubli at 5:00 AM.

Hubli station is massive. Maybe the biggest platform in India. Exited, found the bus stand 5 km away. Auto driver fellow Kannadiga Halkat nan maga charged 200 rupees. Blood boiled, but paid it.

Managed to squeeze onto the Vasco-bound bus, which was heading via Ponda. Even though it was packed, I grabbed a seat. The plan was to get down at Ponda and head to Madgaon, aiming for the 2:00 PM passenger train back to my native place. The bus was painfully slow, but it led to an interesting encounter. 

My co-passenger was from Jharkhand. When he said he was from Dhanbad, I asked, 'Achha, Wasseypur bhi paas padta hai na?' He was shocked I knew the reference. We had a great conversation; he was headed to Goa for work but refused to call himself a 'worker.' He teased me instead, saying, 'Then you’re a slave, bro a corporate one.' We shared some fine banter about life and the internet before parting ways at Ponda. His parting words stuck with me: 'Duniya choti hai dost, agar kismet hui toh milenge dobara' (The world is small, friend; if it's meant to be, we'll meet again).

Treat meal in Margao. Roamed too long, missed the train. Classic. Haha. Yes I was all around in madgaon that I forgot had to catch a train.(Spent too much time sitting in park).

The plan was to catch the same train from Karwar, but the bus from Goa was crawling. Between the slow speed and a time-consuming security checkpoint, I missed the train at Karwar too. At that point, I gave up on the tracks. Despite having other train options, I chose the bus. I don’t even know why, I just did. I treated myself to another masala dosa in Karwar, and by then it was already around 4:35 PM.

The conductor told me there were no direct buses to my native place and suggested going to Kumta instead. I reached Kumta around 7:00 PM and waited an hour. The station office kept delaying, saying the bus would arrive in fifteen minutes, then another half hour. 

At Kumta, I met an interesting old man while waiting. He had been standing there for a long time, waiting for his bus to Bangalore. Every few minutes, he checked his phone messages kept coming in, each saying the bus was delayed again. He blamed the system, the government, the general incompetence of it all. I listened, shared a small counter-view, and he took it in with mixed reactions.

Eventually, he asked where I was headed and why I was traveling alone. I told him I was traveling for fun, though I briefly mentioned the interview. He laughed and asked why I was moving in circles instead of taking a direct route. The question wasn’t judgmental just practical, very him. I didn’t stretch the conversation. It stayed short, honest, and to the point. That felt right.

By 8:00 PM, I’d had enough and boarded a bus to Bhatkal. The stretch from Karwar to Kumta had been hectic and overcrowded, but the ride to Bhatkal was surprisingly smooth, arriving there around 9:30 PM.

At 10:15 PM, the bus to my hometown arrived. It was incredibly crowded. The women at the back refused to move forward, insisting they were getting off at the 'next stop.' It was a mess, but I found it interesting. I could have slept at the bus stand, but chose the chaos and squeezed in anyway. Was literally hanging off the last step until the crowd thinned out a few stops later and finally snagged a seat.

I woke up at my hometown bus station at 1:30 AM just in time. If I hadn’t woken up at that exact second, would have ended up at the final depot miles away. Headed straight to the seating section where dozens of people were sleeping on the floor and benches. I used my bag as a pillow and passed out. At 4:15 AM sharp, woke to the sound of a policeman waking everyone up. By 4:45 AM, was on the first bus toward my house. By 5:35 AM, I was sitting in a local hotel eating idli, and by 5:45 AM, was finally home. Took a great bath after all the journey. That's my Alemaari story.


My travel is about observation. Perception. Perspectives. Hate crowded tourist spots. Prefer the randomness. Life is a psychological pattern.

Like to live as a wanderer. An Alemaari. That’s the philosophy. Peace out.

One of the biggest things I've realised is that freedom isn't really about doing whatever you want. It is more about the heavy responsibility of chosing which hard problems you are actually willing to spend your life solving.

It is a different kind of hard compred to a 9 to 5, and it requires a level of discipline that an office job never really asks of you.

We don't talk enough about the shift from a worker mindset to a CEO mindset. When you're the boss, you have to be the one creating the structure.

1qr0thl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1qr0thl/from_the_industrial_revolution_a_very_short/,From The Industrial Revolution: A Very Short Introduction by Robert C. Allen (Chapter 5 Reform and Democracy),"**Chapter 5**

**Reform and democracy**

The Industrial Revolution created social tensions and posed practical problems that shaped the politics of the period, and affected much of social and cultural life. Most commentators analysed society in terms of the three class model that was anchored in the economics of Adam Smith. **Every price ‘resolves itself either immediately or ultimately into the same three parts of rent, labour, and profit’. Consequently,**

* **the whole annual produce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, must resolve itself into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their stock, or the rent of their land.**

**The division of society into three classes is a useful simplification, but it should be remembered that there was heterogeneity of belief and action in all of these groups, and, indeed, their character evolved over the course of the Industrial Revolution.** How and when that happened are important historical questions. In any event, enough landowners, businessmen, and employees recognized that they were members of a group that had common economic interests that were opposed to those of the other groups, that the three class model provides insight into the politics of the Industrial Revolution.

**Before 1789**

Modern factory industries had begun before the French Revolution, but they had scant impact on the economy as a whole. In 1790, employment in cotton textile mills, the principal factories of the day, was only 80,000—less than 2 per cent of the occupied population. Many more workers were self-employed in cottage industries as pillow lace knitters, weavers, and so forth. Agriculture still accounted for one-third of GDP. Although England looked largely pre-industrial, adverse developments were beginning to appear—the cotton mills were rendering most of the female population, who had been employed as hand spinners, unemployed, with a concomitant increase in rural poverty. In addition, the cotton mills were employing disconcertingly large numbers of children whose employment would raise the question of factory regulation in the 19th century.

Eighteenth-century economic life was conducted in a legal framework handed down from the medieval and Elizabethan periods. Statutes like the Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266–7 regulated the marketing of foodstuffs to prevent price gouging and speculation, and empowered Justices of the Peace (JPs) to set prices. The Statute of Artificers of 1562 empowered JPs to fix wages for most trades. The Poor Law of 1601 required parishes to support their poor.

‘The principle of our constitution is the representation of property, imperfectly in theory, but efficiently in practice.’ In the 18th century, the agricultural rent received by the gentry, aristocracy, and clergy amounted to about one-sixth of the national income, and this group had a higher average income than the capitalists or workers. **The distribution of power and authority followed the distribution of property. At the local level, the squire administered the village and expected deference in return. Nationally, parliament represented landowners. The House of Lords was a predominantly hereditary chamber consisting mainly of great landowners. They also dominated the House of Commons where most constituencies were rural, and many were ‘rotten boroughs’ with only a few voters whose MPs were effectively appointed by the landlord who owned the village. Parliament was the preeminent organ of government following the civil war in the 17th century and the Glorious Revolution of 1688.**

**There was a contradiction in the way the landed classes exercised their power. On the one hand, they believed they governed for the whole nation—everyone had ‘virtual representation’ in parliament even though they could not choose its members—and had a paternalistic responsibility for the well-being of the poor. On the other hand, they did not tolerate royal interference in the management of their affairs, and used their parliamentary power to advance their interests. The assize of bread, the assessment of wages, and the provision of poor relief all proved detrimental to their interests, and they were ignored, repealed, or watered down during the Industrial Revolution. Landowners also advanced their interests through private legislation that authorized the enclosure of open fields, the construction of turnpikes (better roads that charged tolls), and canals, all changes that raised the value of land.** These initiatives also benefited manufacturing and commercial interests, as did the State’s vigour in protecting property, which included manufacturing establishments whenever they were threatened by riotous mobs.

**Most government expenditure was on the army and the Royal Navy, and they were used to expand the British empire and advance British commercial interests abroad. The Navigation Acts meant that the trade of the empire and the markets it provided were reserved for British merchants and manufacturers. While the capitalists were not well represented in parliament, the policies it pursued were broadly in their interests, so there was little to provoke awareness of contradictory interests between capitalists and landowners.**

**There were conflicts of interest, however, between labourers, on the one hand, and landowners and entrepreneurs, on the other. The disputes were local and sporadic rather than national, mass movements. Conflicts often centred on change (supported by landowners and businessmen) versus the preservation of tradition (supported by workers and small-scale farmers). Popular discontent was expressed in local riots rather than in strikes or mass political movements that were the instruments of the workers once they became urban, factory employees.**

Enclosure of the open fields was a great source of dispute. About a fifth of England was enclosed by parliamentary act in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The enclosures were promoted by large landowners hoping to increase the rents from their tenants. While local opinion was consulted, ‘the suffrages were not counted but weighed’ since it was the acreage each person owned that was tallied for or against. The parliamentary process allowed the large owners to override the objections of small owners. Enclosure often extinguished common grazing rights that had benefited many cottagers.

**While they received compensation for the loss of legally defined rights** (parliament zealously defended the *legal* rights of small owners as well as large) **many traditional practices were ended without compensation. On balance many people lost out from enclosure. They objected to the commissioners and rioted on occasion, but there was no coordinated national opposition that would indicate widespread recognition of common interests.**

**Food riots were also common in times of scarcity and high prices. These reflected the peculiar conditions of the 18th century—most people were workers or artisans so they bought their food and so they were hurt by high prices rather than gaining from them as cultivators did. There was a long tradition of State regulation to control speculation, mark-ups, and hoarding. In times of dearth, villagers took direct action, often with the tacit support of paternalistic JPs and sheriffs, to find food stored by farmers and dealers, and force its sale on local markets at normal prices. The ‘moral economy of the crowd’ was in accord with the traditional paternalism. In 1766 the Witney weavers threatened an insurrection unless the farmers lowered the price of corn, which they did.**

**Machine breaking was another form of direct action in support of traditional practices. The framework knitters, for instance, had an ambivalent attitude towards technical change. Inventions were embraced when they allowed a knitter to produce a more highly valued product like a ribbed stocking, but they were resisted when they threatened employment. Machine breaking could have other objectives as well and has been described as ‘collective bargaining by riot’. A wave of machine breaking in Nottingham resulted in The Protection of Stocking Frames Act 1788, which made the destruction of machinery punishable by transportation to Australia**. From 1811 to 1816, machine breaking recurred in northern England. The Luddites (named for Ned Ludd who broke machines in 1779) wrecked machinery in Nottingham. In his first speech to the House of Lords, Lord Byron explained attacks on machinery as a response to technical change:

* These machines were to them \[the owners\] an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to starve. By the adoption of one species of frame in particular, one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment.

Byron’s intervention did not prevent passage of The Destruction of Stocking Frames Act 1812, which increased the penalty to death. Machine breaking spread to hand loom weavers in the West Riding and Lancashire, and there can be little doubt that they were threatened by the power looms they were destroying. **Machine breaking reemerged when mechanization threatened employment. In the Captain Swing riots in eastern England in 1830, farm labourers destroyed threshing machines that eliminated agricultural jobs. Luddites are often imagined as irrational opponents of progress, but the hand workers were not the ones who would benefit from the invention of power looms even in the long run, so their attempts to destroy them made sense.**

**French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars**

While the Industrial Revolution was inexorably undermining the old society, opinion was polarized by the French Revolution, which threw up new challenges that crystallized positions. The French monarchy was overthrown and replaced, briefly, with a democratic republic. The king and thousands of aristocrats were beheaded. Feudalism was abolished. A new religion was declared. The great question was: would Britain go the same way?

The Revolution had many supporters in Britain who believed that democracy would make a better world. Initially, supporters included many who were well to do, but their enthusiasm faded as the Revolution turned murderous.

The Revolution spawned a pamphlet war between supporters and critics. Thomas Paine’s *The Rights of Man* was the most widely read pro-Revolutionary tract. Its arguments were not unique, but they were forcefully stated. **It made a powerful contribution to a working class point of view, but it was far from the finished product. On the political plane, Paine endorsed the view that people had fundamental natural rights to life and liberty, and that they always retained the right to overthrow a government that did not respect those rights. The Bastille, the prison in Paris where political prisoners were incarcerated, symbolized the despotism of the French monarchy that rendered the Revolution legitimate.**

**On the economic plane, Paine was equally anti-aristocratic. He believed the land, being a product of nature, ought to belong to everyone rather than a small minority. Land ownership was regarded as the basis of independence in the 18th century.** Paine did not, however, advocating breaking up the great estates, but instead he proposed the progressive taxation of land rent to raise money for pensions and social services.

Perhaps a million copies of *The Rights of Man* were sold, and it was read aloud in coffee houses, so many more people heard his words. **Universal rights, democracy, and socialization of land rent appealed to many working class, as well as middle class, readers. It responded to a world in which the inequalities originated in agriculture rather than industry and appealed to the weavers and framework knitters as much as to the factory workers. The self-employed artisans gravitated towards a Republican outlook, which denigrated employees as wage-slaves (they had to do as they were told by their boss) and idealized the self-employed artisan as truly free: the latter could choose to celebrate Saint Monday by taking the day off, while the former could not. When the Witney weavers were transformed from independent artisans into factory employees early in the 19th century, John Early, the leading employer, observed that they had ‘a dislike to be under restriction as to time’. Richard Osborne, a weaver, added that ‘some of them come sauntering in on Monday towards the middle of the day, some get to work on Tuesday, and some do not work the latter end of Saturday’. Workers who skived off were suspended as a punishment. For these workers, the ideal society was an egalitarian democracy of independent craftsmen carrying on their businesses in free markets.**

**These views had widespread support.** The London Corresponding Society, founded in 1792, pressed for democracy and was joined by provincial counterparts. The upper classes were terrified.

* If Mr. Paine should be able to rouze up the lower classes, their interference will probably be marked by wild work, and all we now possess, whether in private property or public liberty, will be at the mercy of a lawless and furious rabble.

Paine was charged with ‘seditious libel’ (criticism of the Crown and government), convicted, and sentenced to death, although he was never apprehended. There was a wide ranging crackdown on dissent. The stamp duty on newspapers was raised progressively from 1.5 to 4 pence between 1789 and 1815 to confine political discussion to the rich. Detention without trial was instituted, and numerous radicals were charged with criminal offences. The Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 prohibited trade unions and collective bargaining. The old order was defended against all democratic challenges.

**1815-32**

Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo in 1815 inaugurated two decades of economic and political instability. The next five years were difficult for workers. Demobilizing hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors led to a drop in national income and widespread unemployment. **As patriotic enthusiasm ebbed and poverty increased, so did demands for parliamentary reform. The result was five years of working class agitation for the vote.**

**Mass meetings were held to endorse petitions demanding universal suffrage. This looked like incipient revolution to the upper classes. The culmination in 1819 was a pro-reform rally outside of Manchester which attracted up to 60,000 people. The Manchester yeomanry attacked the crowd and killed eleven demonstrators—the Peterloo massacre.**

**The government tried to suppress popular protest with the Six Acts including the Seditious Meetings Act that prohibited political gatherings of more than fifty people. Popular agitation for democracy was repressed for a decade.**

**The working class was not alone in demanding electoral reform. The middle class was provoked by one of the great acts of aristocratic self-interest—the Corn Laws in 1815.**

**Trade between Britain and the continent was frequently precluded between 1789 and 1815 by war and blockade.** Wheat imports were limited.

In the 1780s British prices were modestly higher than those abroad but poor harvests (indicated by sharp spikes) drove the British wheat price above that abroad during the French Wars. **As David Ricardo’s theory of rent explained, high wheat prices caused high rents since rent was the difference between the value of the wheat harvested and the labour and capital costs incurred in its cultivation. The high prices of the war years caused widespread distress, but the gentry and aristocracy did very well, indeed, as their tenant farmers paid ever more for their land. The resumption of peace in 1815 portended a surge in wheat imports that would have driven British prices back down to the continental level. Rents would have dropped in consequence. To forestall those possibilities, Parliament legislated high tariffs on imported corn.** In 1814, Francis Place wrote thus to James Mill:

* The legislature will certainly do all in its power to keep up the rent of land, and will pass an Act for that purpose next session in spite of everything which can be done to prevent it. The rich landholders will see nothing but the decrease of rents, and having the power they will certainly prevent it, be the consequences whatever they may.

As Figure 14 shows, the measure worked. British wheat prices remained close to double those in Amsterdam, Europe’s great free trade port, for the next three decades. The landed classes did not act like ‘virtual representatives’ of the whole community, but secured their position at the expense of the workers and capitalists. The Corn Laws convinced many in the middle class that they too needed electoral reform.

Reform was an important issue in the election of 1830. It inaugurated two years of dramatic political twists and turns that culminated in the Reform Bill of 1832. Conservatives aimed to split the middle class reformers from the workers, so that those with property had some representation, while those without did not. ‘The real battle is not between Whigs and Tories, Liberals and Illiberals and such gentlemen-like denominations, but between property and no-property—Swing and the law.’ Fifty-six tiny ‘rotten’ boroughs were abolished and another thirty lost one of their two representatives. The freed up seats were allocated to cities that had not been represented in parliament before as well as to rural districts. In addition, the property requirements for voting were lowered in many areas. As a result, the electorate expanded from 400,000 to 650,000 (about one-fifth of the adult males).

**Commercial and manufacturing interests acquired more influence in parliament than they had previously enjoyed; however, parliament was still led by rural landowners. And the working class still lacked the vote.**

**1832-46**

By enlarging middle class representation in parliament, the Reform Act changed the political landscape. John Stuart Mill remarked, ‘wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of class superiority’. The middle class celebrated the entrepreneur, free competition, and reward for achievement. One by one social institutions were remodelled to embody these virtues. In the 18th century, State jobs were filled by patronage appointments. Appointment by merit would produce a more effective, cheaper government. The new ideal was realized at first on a case by case basis and became general policy with the establishment of the Civil Service Commission in 1855 and the first civil service examinations.

Competition would be introduced into religion by disestablishing the Church of England. While this was not achieved, the Church rates that supported it were abolished in 1868 after much campaigning.

One of the earliest and most far reaching reforms was the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. England’s system of poor relief was based on a series of Elizabethan statutes. Most relief was given in cash or kind directly to the poor—so-called ‘outdoor relief’. The alternative was ‘indoor relief’ in a workhouse. The Workhouse Test Act of 1723 allowed parishes to fulfil their relief obligation by establishing a workhouse. Anyone could admit him- or herself to the workhouse, but the workhouse, often modelled on a prison, was designed to be so unappealing that only the truly destitute would resort to it. Workhouses were unusual in the 18th century.

Poor Law costs were stable until the second half of the 18th century when they began an inexorable rise and with them the property tax that financed them. **The causes included population growth, which increased the supply of labour, enclosure, and the amalgamation of farms, which reduced labour demand and eliminated much common grazing, and the mechanization of spinning, which eliminated the part time work of many women. The Poor Law authorities responded to the growing need by providing farm labourers with increased support through such devices as the Speenhamland bread scale, which linked support to the (rising) cost of bread. Malthus gained his renown by arguing that generous poor relief led to population growth, which only exacerbated the poverty problem. By the 19th century, landowners and capitalists alike were convinced that the system of poor relief must be changed.**

**The machine breaking of the Swing riots highlighted the dangers of rural poverty and prompted the appointment of a Poor Law Commission in 1832. Its recommendations resulted in the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 that created the so-called ‘New Poor Law’. It stipulated that the able bodied be relieved only in a workhouse. Outdoor relief continued but on a reduced scale. The law also changed the organization of the system by grouping parishes into Poor Law unions that administered the law locally and by establishing a national commission to oversee it. The cost of poor relief fell. The law worked badly, however, in industrial areas since it was not designed as unemployment insurance.**

**The New Poor Law was condemned by many reformers for its mean spiritedness, and it alienated many in the working class for whom the old Poor Law had been a guarantee against destitution during illness, old age, or a bad economy. The New Poor Law did, however, provide a floor to incomes. The importance of this was shown indirectly when the potato crop failed in Ireland in the mid-1840s leading to the Famine. Ireland had no Poor Law even though it was part of the United Kingdom. Had there been an Irish Poor Law, famine would have been averted.**

While Poor Law reform united the middle class and the aristocracy, the two groups were pitted against each other in one of the great battles of the age—the repeal of the Corn Laws. As Figure 14 indicates, the tariff on grain meant that English wheat was twice as expensive as Dutch wheat between 1815 and 1846. High wheat prices meant high farm rents and high incomes for the gentry and aristocracy. Since the standard view was that wages were at bare subsistence, an increase in the price of food meant that workers were paid more money to buy the same food they had before. Rising money wages meant rising manufacturing costs, which reduced the competitiveness of British industry. The gain of the landlords came at the expensive of the capitalists. The commercial and manufacturing classes were firmly opposed to the Corn Laws, while the working class was comparatively indifferent.

The Corn Laws were controversial from their enactment in 1815. Adam Smith had made the case for free trade in 1776, and David Ricardo sharpened the logic with the principle of comparative advantage in 1817. In 1820, a ‘merchant’s petition’ was presented to parliament calling for repeal, but it was rejected. Charles Pelham Villiers, MP, introduced a motion in parliament calling for repeal every year from 1837 to 1845, but all failed. In 1839, the Anti-Corn Law League was formed to campaign against the law. Richard Cobden and John Bright became its most effective spokesmen. The League was an efficient propaganda machine that produced boundless tracts, raised much money, sent speakers round the country, and involved millions in its activities. *The Economist* magazine was founded as part of the effort, and its first editor Walter Bagehot recalled, ‘There has never, perhaps, been another time in the history of the world when excited masses of men and women hung on the words of one talking political economy.’

Despite the efforts of middle class MPs like Villiers, Cobden, and Bright, they had no hope of repealing the Corn Laws on their own. A majority of MPs in the House of Commons were landowners, and they dominated the House of Lords as well. Robert Peel, the conservative prime minister, had opposed repeal for years, but he switched his position and supported it in 1846—ostensibly as a relief measure for the famine in Ireland. He induced the Duke of Wellington to see the bill through the House of Lords as a necessity for maintaining public order. **Why Peel changed his mind and why the parliament of landowners went along with him remain scholarly mysteries. Some results are clear, however. First, British wheat prices abruptly aligned with those abroad (Figure 14), but the level did not drop precipitately, and British agriculture remained prosperous until the ‘American grain invasion’ in the 1870s. Second, the conservative party split, Peel’s fraction joined with the Whigs and Radicals to form the Liberals. Third, the conservatives remained out of power for two decades. Repealing the Corn Laws was a great victory for the manufacturing interests.**

**But the manufacturers did not have it all their own way. They were opposed by workers, the landed classes, and even members of the middle class appalled by the poverty that accompanied progress. One of the first to try to reform the factory system was Robert Owen, himself an owner of the New Lanark mill. In the first quarter of the 19th century, he introduced education for the child workers and replaced the ‘truck system’, by which mill owners sold their employees overpriced consumer goods, with a form of cooperative shop**. Owen endorsed legislation to limit the length of the working day and cut the day to 10 hours at New Lanark. By 1817, he was a professed socialist.

The economic situation for many workers only got worse in the second quarter of the 19th century as the hand trades continued to collapse. Writers of many political views were shocked by the inequality and materialism of these years. In *Signs of the Times* (1829) Thomas Carlyle deplored the widespread poverty, which he attributed to the destruction of hand work by machine production.

* **Were we required to characterise this age of ours by any single epithet, we should be tempted to call it … the Mechanical Age … Nothing is now done directly, or by hand; all is by rule and calculated contrivance … the living artisan is driven from his workshop, to make room for a speedier, inanimate one. The shuttle drops from the fingers of the weaver, and falls into iron fingers that ply it faster.**

The result was a great increase in the national income—‘how much better fed, clothed, lodged and, in all outward respects, accommodated men now are, or might be, by a given quantity of labour, is a grateful reflection which forces itself on every one’—but, in fact, the gains accrued largely to the rich. **‘Wealth has more and more increased, and at the same time gathered itself more and more into masses, strangely altering the old relations, and increasing the distance between the rich and the poor.’ But the increased wealth was not a blessing even for the rich, for their minds withered as all thought was reconfigured in the image of the machine.**

* **Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand. They have lost faith in individual endeavour, and in natural force, of any kind … Their whole efforts, attachments, opinions, turn on mechanism, and are of a mechanical character.**

These concerns defined the ‘condition of England question’, a term coined by Carlyle in 1839, that preoccupied many other writers—among them Benjamin Disraeli, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Kingsley, and Charles Dickens.

But it was not simply imaginative writers who exposed social problems. **Middle class reformers with a social science disposition did the same. Middle class thinking was usually based on Bentham’s ‘fundamental axiom**, *it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong*’. **This was conventionally used to defend laissez-faire economics, for if two people voluntarily agreed to an exchange (for instance, a day’s labour for 2 shillings) then the satisfaction of both parties must have increased—and with it the total happiness of society—for, otherwise, why would they have agreed? However, if the cumulative effect of many such bargains was to enrich the few and impoverish the many, then there would be a case for the State to redistribute income from the rich to the poor so long as the extra shilling that the poor woman received increased her happiness more than the loss in happiness sustained by the rich person who lost it. Or if household industrial waste draining into a river damaged the health of the people downstream who drank its waters, then again there was a case for State intervention to provide clean water.**

**Reasoning along these lines led reformers to advocate State action that limited the free market and created space for the State to improve social welfare. Usually the case for reform required facts, and the second quarter of the 19th century witnessed a large increase in fact collection. Some of this was undertaken by the State—the decennial census, for instance, was broadened to track the changing occupational structure of the nation. In 1837 the State took over (from the Church) the responsibility of registering births and deaths. Other facts were collected by special commissions investigating all manner of problems. Non-governmental organizations also collected facts.** The Manchester Statistical Society, perhaps the most famous, was founded in 1833 ‘to assist in promoting the progress of social improvement in the manufacturing population’. Social exposés were the order of the day, Friedrich Engels’s *The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844* being a notable example, but it was not alone.

**Working class distress created a political opening for the Tories that did lead to some legislative relief for workers. The issue was the employment of children in factories.**

**Children were widely employed in the pre-industrial economy, many with their parents and the rest as apprentices or domestic servants. The Arkwright cotton mills, however, employed vast numbers of children who were not under parental supervision. Thousands of children were sent to the mills by Poor Law guardians under apprentice contracts. The State had long regulated apprenticeship, and some ineffectual legislation dealing with cotton mills was passed early in the 19th century to this end.**

The first significant employment legislation was the Factory Act of 1833. Its author was Michael Thomas Sadler. He was a Tory MP representing a rotten borough, who believed that the landed classes could govern Britain responsibly. He wrote a book on population that disputed Malthus’ theory, he fought to have the Poor Law extended to Ireland, and he opposed parliamentary reform. In 1831, he took over parliament sponsorship of a bill to reduce the working day of children in cotton mills from 12 hours to 9. He chaired a committee that wrote a devastating report on the overwork and abuse of children in factories, and he gave a powerful speech in parliament arguing that employers and workers did not negotiate on equal terms in the labour market—so workers deserved legislative protection. Although his rotten borough was abolished by the Reform Act, and he failed to win a seat in the next election, the persuasiveness of the evidence and logic of his position led to the passage of the act in 1833 that was the first step in reducing the length of the working day. Acts in the next decades cut the length of the working day further and broadened the coverage of the legislation.

**Sadler’s contribution was also important politically as a step in redefining Toryism. Ironically, the Tories, defenders of tradition, had to constantly reinvent themselves. The political creed of the 18th century—that the landed classes were the natural leaders of society and the advancement of their interests was the first task of government—was increasingly out of synch with social development, so new angles had to be found to argue that rule by the aristocracy was in the general interest. Factory legislation was a new spin on Tory paternalism, and, indeed, Sadler was hailed as the child’s defender in the North of England. Red Toryism was born.**

*David Copperfield* **and the Factory Act of 1833 were all well and good, but the working class could not rely on the upper classes to protect its interests. What it needed was the vote, and workers mobilized for it just as the middle class had mobilized against the Corn Laws. Workers had been part of the campaign to reform parliament that resulted in the Reform Act of 1832. When they were excluded from the franchise, many workers felt betrayed, and the sense of betrayal was deepened by reforms like the New Poor Law. The working class press agitated for democracy in the 1830s.** A group of six MPs and six working class leaders drew up the People’s Charter in 1838, and it crystallized their demands. One radical remembered that:

* There were \[radical\] associations all over the country, but there was a great lack of cohesion. One wanted the ballot, another manhood suffrage and so on. … The radicals were without unity of aim and method, and there was but little hope of accomplishing anything. When, however, the People’s Charter was drawn up … clearly defining the urgent demands of the working classes, we felt we had a real bond of union; and so transformed our Radical Associations into local Chartist centres.

**The six demands of the People’s Charter were: (1) universal male suffrage; (2) a secret ballot; (3) no property qualification for being an MP; (4) payment for MPs so workers could serve; (5) equal sized constituencies; and (6) annual elections. Huge public meetings were organized in support of the Charter. It was presented to parliament in 1839 with supporting petitions signed by 1.3 million people, but parliament voted not to consider it.**

**In response, the ‘physical force’ chartists turned towards violence. Arms were collected, groups drilled. In 1839 chartists marched on the Westgate Hotel in Newport in the hope of sparking a national insurrection. In a confrontation with soldiers, more than twenty chartists were killed, many were wounded, and the rest fled.**

Armed confrontations occurred for several years, but they were always defeated, and the ringleaders punished.

The core of the protest remained peaceful. **Under the leadership of Fergus O’Connor and his newspaper** *The Northern Star* **more mass meetings were held, the Charter was again sent to parliament in 1842, this time with more than three million signatures, and was again rejected. Hundreds of chartists were arrested and convicted, although the prosecution of the fifty-eight most prominent leaders failed.**

**Peaceful chartists continued to protest and physical force chartists to drill. Some chartists contested elections and Fergus O’Connor was elected to parliament in 1847, the only one to succeed. In 1848, hundreds of thousands of chartists marched on London to present the Charter, signed again by millions, once more to parliament. The State mobilized a vast force to stop them, but there was no violent confrontation. Parliament again rejected the petition. Agitation continued through the 1850s without success.**

**1846-67**

Between 1846 and 1867, the economic situation in Britain fundamentally changed. As Figure 2 and Boxes 5 and 6 showed, the wage stagnation that characterized the first half of the 19th century ended, as average consumption per head in working class families rose by 42 per cent. **This was the period in which machine production replaced handicraft methods across the economy. At last, high productivity jobs were being created at a faster rate than low productivity jobs were disappearing. These changes underpinned the rise in wages.**

**The politics of the period saw further advances of the middle class goals of competition and reward for achievement. Free trade in manufactured goods, for instance, was realized with the abolition of the Navigation Acts in 1849. Working class activism shifted away from chartism to trade union organization. These unions were more concerned with negotiating higher wages and better working conditions than with radical reform. The London Trades Council was established in 1860 and the national Trades Union Congress in 1868. A Royal Commission on Trade Unions in 1867 endorsed them as beneficial to employers and employees, and they were legalized in 1871. Nevertheless, unions did not have enough members to explain the general rise in wages that occurred between 1846 and 1867.**

Three events occurred in 1867 that marked the end of the Industrial Revolution. First, Marx published volume 1 of *Capital*, which gave his explanation for why capitalism would never generate rising real wages even though it did lead to economic growth. Marx was born in 1818, and his view of capitalism was formed when he was around 20 years old. At that time the average real wage was flat, and the hand trades were in crisis. He took that to be the norm and developed an explanation that fitted that period. Second, Baxter estimated the national income for 1867, and his figures show that real wages had risen dramatically in the previous two decades. Wages were rising because the old handicraft mode of production had finally been destroyed by the machine mode. Marx was so intent on penning *Capital* that he missed this. **Third, one group that had not missed the change was the ruling class. As the real wages of workers rose, they acquired—for the first time—a stake in the system. Their politics shifted from revolution to what would become known as social democracy. It was, therefore, safe to allow them to vote. Disraeli, the first conservative prime minister since Peel, extended the franchise to skilled workers in 1867. The Industrial Revolution was finished.**

1qr0su0,https://i.redd.it/oyxug40dgggg1.jpeg,"The ""freedom"" of working for yourself is a bit of a trap isn't it?","I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the way self employment is usually sold to us. I see the photos of people working from coffee shops or sleeping in until noon, but the reality is usually a lot mre gritty than that. 

One of the biggest things I've realised is that freedom isn't really about doing whatever you want. It is more about the heavy responsibility of chosing which hard problems you are actually willing to spend your life solving. 



It is a different kind of hard compred to a 9 to 5, and it requires a level of discipline that an office job never really asks of you.

We don't talk enough about the shift from a worker mindset to a CEO mindset. When you're the boss, you have to be the one creating the structure. 



Honestly, working for yourself isn't for everyone and that is fine. Some people are just better suited for a team envirnment and a steady structure. 

I’m into my fifth year as a Director now and I’m still learning these lessons the hard way.

But I’m curious to hear from you lot what was the one thing about going solo that turned out to be way harder than you expected? Is the freedom what you thought it would be?",1,1769765137.0,workingforyourself,0,1.0,False

I’m using the API to scan pull requests for security vulnerabilities, but I kept running into a brick wall: the model was flagging perfectly valid code as ""critical risks"" just to have something to say. It felt like I was back in prompt engineering 101, fighting with a model that would rather hallucinate a bug than admit a file was clean.

At first, I did exactly what you’re not supposed to do: I bloated the prompt with ""DO NOT"" rules and cap-locked warnings. I wrote a 500-word block of text explaining why it shouldn't be ""helpful"" by making up issues, but the output just got noisier and more confused. I was treating the model like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine, and it was costing me a fortune in tokens.

I finally walked away, grabbed a coffee, and decided to strip everything back. I deleted the entire ""Rules"" section and gave the model a new persona: a ""Zero-Trust Security Auditor"". I told it that if no vulnerability was found, it must return a specific null schema and nothing else—no apologies, no extra context. I even added a ""Step 0"" where it had to summarize the logic of the code before checking it for flaws.

The results were night and day. 50 files processed with zero false positives. It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, more instructions usually just equal more noise. Sometimes you have to strip away the ""human"" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.

Has anyone else found that ""Negative Prompting"" actually makes things worse for your specific workflow? It feels like I just learned the hard way that less is definitely more.",2,1769765101.0,LargeLanguageModels,0,1.0,False

1qr0qze,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alovation/comments/1qr0qze/5_simple_tips_to_alovate_how_to_tune_into_the/,"5 Simple Tips to ""Alovate"" – How to Tune Into the Quiet Hum Underneath","Alovation—the quiet hum of elevated love or spiritual resonance that exists underneath the noise of daily life, stress, and old pain. It's the ""signal"" beneath the ""static.""

But how do you actually do it? How do you ""Alovate""?

Here are 5 simple, practical tips to help you tune in. Think of these as ways to adjust your inner dial toward that frequency.

Tip 1: Find Your Alovarium

An Alovarium is any space where the Alovation frequency is protected and can breathe. This isn't about a perfect meditation room.

· How: Identify one small, physical space. It could be a corner of a room, your car before you drive, a specific walking path. Your only rule in this space is: no intentional static. No doomscrolling, no replaying arguments. Just be there. Let it become a signal anchor.

Tip 2: Practice the 3-Second Pause

Before reacting—to a stressful message, a triggering memory, a moment of panic—institute a 3-second pause.

· How: In that pause, don't try to think. Just ask internally: ""What's the hum under this noise?"" You're not looking for an answer, you're creating a space where the signal could be noticed. This builds the muscle of discernment.

Tip 3: Name the Static

You can't tune out noise you haven't identified. Often, the static has familiar ""stations"": Fear, Abandonment, Shame, Urgency.

· How: When you feel overwhelmed, try to simply name the primary frequency of the static. Say to yourself, ""This is the sound of the Abandonment static,"" or ""This is Shame noise."" Naming it separates you from it, making the true signal clearer by contrast.

Tip 4: Follow the ""Thirst""

The feeling of longing, peace, or quiet love is itself evidence of the ""water."" Your positive pull is a better guide than fighting the negative push.

· How: Ask: ""What's one tiny thing that feels like a 'yes' right now?"" Not a big purpose, but a micro-yes. A glass of water? Standing at the window? A single deep breath? Do that. It's aligning with the pull.

Tip 5: Conduct a Daily Resonance Check-In

At one specific moment each day (e.g., after your morning coffee, before bed), take 60 seconds.

· How: Ask two questions:
  1. ""What was the loudest static today?"" (Just name it, no judgment.)
  2. ""When did I feel the quietest hum, however faint?"" (Maybe it was a moment of kindness, a line in a song, the light through a tree.)
   **This trains your attention to spot the signal.

The goal isn't to be in a constant state of Alovation. The goal is to recognize when you've slipped into pure static, and know a simple way to search for the dial again.

What about you? What's one small way you tune into what matters underneath the noise?",1,1769764946.0,u_Alovation,0,1.0,False

1qr0o6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qr0o6l/specialità_vs_modern_burrs_real_upgrade_or/,Specialità vs. Modern Burrs: Real Upgrade or Diminishing Returns?,"I’ve got a question / discussion for the espresso nerds here who’ve gone down the “expensive grinder” rabbit hole.

Everyone online repeats “the grinder matters most,” but there’s way less practical talk about how much you actually gain when you move from a solid grinder to a more expensive, “modern/high-clarity” grinder. People mention “clarity” a lot, but I’m trying to figure out where the diminishing returns kick in for my setup.

Obviously blade grinders and cheap entry-level stuff can make espresso miserable. But what about the jump from a genuinely decent grinder to something like a high-clarity single-doser with newer burr geometry? Is it a night-and-day thing, or more like “the last 10–15%”?

I also know roast level matters: darker roasts are generally easier to extract, while light roasts can be more demanding. What I’m really wondering is: are lighter roasts genuinely not enjoyable on a mid-tier grinder, or are they still totally good—just missing that last bit of separation/sweetness/definition?

My specific situation:

I’m using an Eureka Mignon Specialità, set up to single dose (single dose hopper + King Sized dial). I bought it a few years ago, early in my espresso journey because it was widely recommended, easy to get, and has been solid. But lately, with all the talk about clarity and light roasts, I’m getting a bit insecure about how much I’m leaving on the table.

If I upgrade to an Eureka Single Dose Pro with Black Diamond burrs, should I expect a significant improvement in the cup, or more of a moderate refinement? I’ve also seen that Kaffeemacher:innen use that grinder for dialing in and describing coffees—so when they talk about flavor notes, they’re tasting shots produced with that kind of setup. Am I realistically able to get anywhere close to that style of shot on a Specialità, or is the grinder a hard limiter?

And if not the Eureka, what about other options people rave about like the Mazzer Philos? Is this all “nice to have,” or is it one of those situations where if you’re trying to do modern light-roast espresso, the Specialità will have you thinking you just don’t like the coffee?

Curious to hear your experiences—especially from people who upgraded from something in the Specialità tier to a higher-clarity grinder. What changed, and was it worth it?

One last note; I am aware, that I should not feel FOMO if I am happy with how my shots taste. However my taste should not be the point of this discussion.",5,1769764665.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1qr0n6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qr0n6f/how_to_actually_make_people_like_you_the/,How to ACTUALLY Make People Like You: The Psychology That Nobody Talks About,"look, i've spent way too much time studying this. books on social psychology, hours of podcast interviews with therapists and researchers, youtube deep dives into charisma breakdowns. and honestly? most advice about making people like you is complete garbage.



everyone's out here saying ""just be yourself"" or ""smile more"" like that's some groundbreaking insight. but here's what actually works, backed by real research and observation of how humans actually operate.



stop trying to be interesting, start being interested



this sounds stupidly simple but most people completely miss it. charisma researcher Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly in ""The Charisma Myth"" (she's worked with everyone from Google execs to military leaders). the book literally rewired how i think about social interactions. best part? charisma isn't some genetic lottery, it's completely learnable.



the trick is genuine curiosity. not the fake ""so what do you do?"" small talk bullshit. ask follow up questions. when someone mentions they went hiking last weekend, don't just nod and pivot to your story. ask where they went, what made them choose that trail, if they saw anything cool. people light up when they realize you actually care.



mirror subtly (but don't be a creep about it)



neuroscience shows we're hardwired to like people who are similar to us. it triggers the brain's reward centers. so match their energy level. if they're speaking softly and thoughtfully, don't blast them with loud enthusiasm. if they're animated, match that vibe. copy their body language slightly, use similar vocabulary. your brain does this naturally with people you already like, so you're just speeding up the process.



be vulnerable first



brené brown has literally made a career studying this (her ted talk has like 60 million views for a reason). ""Daring Greatly"" is insanely good if you want the full breakdown. she's a research professor who spent decades studying shame and vulnerability.



here's the thing though. you can't force others to open up then expect connection. YOU have to go first. share something real. not trauma dumping on a first meeting, but actual thoughts and feelings. ""honestly i was nervous about coming tonight"" or ""i've been struggling with this project and it's been frustrating"" creates way more connection than pretending everything's perfect.



people trust vulnerability because it signals you're not hiding shit. and trust is the foundation of being liked.



remember the spotlight effect is lying to you



this concept from social psychology research will change your life. basically, you think everyone's noticing and judging everything you do. they're not. they're too busy worrying about themselves.



that weird thing you said? they forgot it in 30 seconds. your outfit choice? nobody cares as much as you think. this realization is incredibly freeing because it means you can relax and actually be present instead of performing some exhausting character.



use people's names (but not excessively)



dale carnegie wrote about this in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" back in like 1936 and it's still true. hearing your own name activates the brain differently than other words. it creates a tiny hit of dopamine. so use it. ""hey sarah, what do you think about..."" feels way more engaging than ""what do you think about...""



just don't overdo it. once or twice in a conversation, not every sentence.



give specific compliments



""you're cool"" does nothing. ""i really appreciate how you always remember to ask about my mom when we talk, that's thoughtful"" actually lands. specificity shows you're paying attention. it shows the compliment is real, not some generic nicety you'd say to anyone.



and compliment effort and choices, not just inherent traits. ""you're smart"" vs ""the way you explained that concept was really clear and helpful"" hits different.



actually listen (like, for real)



most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. they're not listening, they're rehearsing their response. this is backed by communication research, we retain like 25% of what we hear in conversations because we're not actually present.



try this: when someone's talking, focus entirely on understanding them. don't plan what you'll say next. just listen. pause before responding. people can feel when you're truly hearing them vs performing listening. it's rare enough that it makes you memorable.



show up consistently



the mere exposure effect is a legit psychological phenomenon. people tend to develop preferences for things merely because they're familiar with them. so just... be around. show up to events. respond to messages. be reliable.



consistency builds trust and comfort. both are prerequisites for being liked.



match people's communication style



some people text in paragraphs, others send 47 short messages. some want to call, others prefer email. pay attention and adapt. it shows respect for how they operate.



same with humor styles, conversation pacing, even topic preferences. this isn't being fake, it's being considerate.



let people help you occasionally



counterintuitive right? but the benjamin franklin effect is real. he literally documented how asking a rival for a small favor made that person like him more. psychologists confirmed it. when someone does you a favor, their brain rationalizes ""i must like this person if i'm helping them.""



so don't be completely self sufficient. ask for small things. ""could you recommend a good coffee shop around here?"" or ""would you mind looking over this email quick?"" it creates connection.



manage your energy and mood



this is the unsexy truth. if you're constantly exhausted, irritable, or negative, people won't enjoy being around you. emotional contagion is real. moods spread.



so take care of yourself. sleep enough. move your body. do things that genuinely make you happy. people are drawn to those who seem content and energized. not fake positive, but genuinely okay.



apps like Finch can help with habit building through gamification (the cute bird character thing genuinely works for some people). there's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. 



you tell it what you want to work on, like improving social skills or becoming more emotionally intelligent, and it builds an adaptive learning plan tailored to your specific challenges. the virtual coach avatar can recommend content based on your struggles, and you can customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. it covers a lot of the psychology books mentioned here plus way more. worth checking out if you're into structured self-improvement.



look, there's no magic formula. human connection is messy and unpredictable. but these patterns show up consistently in research and real interactions. the common thread? most of this is about making others feel seen, heard, and valued.



turns out being liked isn't really about you at all.

I recently roasted a beautiful Ethiopian from the Guji region. I roasted my first batch to 16,6% with a drop temp of 208°C, with the purpose of cupping for flavour profiling alongside the next roast wich I developed to 20% with a DT of 212°C. Did a few more batches all 20% with DT 210-213°C

This was roasted on monday. I cupped on Tuesday and got vevlety milk chocolate laced with blueberry and slight floral notes. Blending it with brazil Cerrado for our house blend gives it a nice boost in chocolatey nutty flavour to hold againt the milk😁. Alas when I made my frnch press with the same Ethiopian this morning(20% batch) I could barely taste anything. My grind size is slightly on the finer side of filter as I like the flavours to be more intense. 

I always bloom with a little lukewarm water before completely emerging the grounds after which I wait 4-5 minutes, stirring once at the 2min mark. I suspect the lack in flavour might be that the cofdee still need to degas but I can't think that alone would cause the coffee to be flat?? Aromas from the beans themselves are intensely chocolate and blueberry on the nose...

For some context

Growing up my parents has 3, my two younger sisters and myself.  They would requestly treat me like i was invisible and my mum started working as the suport worker for my year at school for my entire high-school years.

As well as this, her being a support worker, people woukd be friends so they could come to mine when school was out and see my mum. And if we had a fight my mum would make me feel guilty and take their side because of their personal lives.

We then spoke about prom, my mum told me she was going. I told her that i didn't want her to go and that i wanted one night to be a normal kid that can party without their parents.
She said ok and i went to prom in my dads car with him driving. 10 minutes after arriving guess who parked up. MY MUM.
The whole night people were just asking me about where my mum was and what she was doing or would ignore me to speak to her.

At home Once i turned 15 i finally got my own room. However this only happened after her parents and my dads said it was weird that i didn't have my own room.
But a year later, when i was sofa surfing and in college, i came home from college and they had moved all my stuff out and gave me a space as wide as a door in my sisters room until i was 18. During this time they would slowly pack my stuff away and place my sisters stuff on the desk at the end of my bed. She also got angry and told me i was inconsiderate for wanting to paint a singular wall black as it would stop my sister sleeping.

At 18 i started seeing my now ex boyfriend, i would stay with him for a week and go home for the weekend. But every time i went home i was ignored and it was like i wasnt even there. So i eventually moved out and started lowering contact.
I then moved out by myself and needed help moving my stuff. My dad said he would help. After speaking to my dad more recently,
 (we went no contact but spoke about everything and he apologised and understands why i did what i did and we have started fresh)
He told me that my mum argued with him and made him sleep on the couch for wanting to come and help me.

After meeting my now boyfriend and moving in with him almost 2 years ago, i decided to try keep contact with them as they were my parents. We would drive 3 hours to her house to see her, help her with household chores and my younger sisters (now 16 and 12).
We would frequently offer for my mum to come over and have a day to herself while we took my sister's out and offered to take her out for lunch too. But she would always put it off. I would tell myself it was fine because she had to care for my sisters.

But then my parents split up (they have split up before 3 times but this is permanent) and my mum already had started seeing a new man. Which is fine, i want her happy. But i then start hearing from my sisters that she'll disappear for hours leaving my sisters alone at home. And how she travels 3 hours to see him and how they keep going on trips.

This hurt because at this point for almost a year we had been travelling to see her and had gone down at least 8-9 times.

Now more recently 

I was on call with my sisters (were not mega close but we call occasionally) and my mum was doing her hair. I said hello to my mum and asked how she was and in response i got a death glare and a 'hi' that was it. So i made an excuse to hang up as i was uncomfortable and hurt by this.

So i decided to go no contact, she would never reach out or ask how i was. Every time i messaged i would become her therapist and i didn't feel wanted. I blocked her

Over the next few months i decided to write her a letter detailing why i was upset and hurt and why i decided to make the decision i did.

Now the reason i feel like an asshole is because my dad keeps telling me i was 'horrible for sending a letter to mum near a birthday just telling her how shit she is'

I didn't tell her she was shit, i wrote it from my perspective and how things that happened hurt and why. Not attacking her, not telling her she was shit. Just facts and feelings.

So AITAH for not speaking to my mum

Ps. The letter was sent end of September last yeat, arrived october (her birthday month) and we stopped talking around august that year. My old phone bricked and i got a new number and don't have her contact anymore 

Also she did get me a Christmas present, i wasn't expecting anything, maybe a letter but i got a french press and 4 different types of coffee (im a barista and have a passion for coffee) and some body wash. No letter, no note. Nothing. (My dad came down for Christmas with one of my sisters and she bought it with them)
I did write her a thank you note and put my address in there for her to be able to write me back as i don't wanna go full contact and want her to have to make an effort",4,1769763984.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I want to have kids, and he doesn’t. When we started dating, I was 23 and it didn’t seem like an issue. We could have fun and part ways later. We ended up having so much fun and love that breaking up became harder and harder. Eventually, we found the strength to end things last October.

Since then, it’s been tough, but I wasn’t as miserable as I expected. I was somewhat prepared. We still see each other occasionally (with long breaks in between) because we don’t hate each other. There’s still a deep connection and a lot of love.

Yesterday I saw him for coffee. He asked if I was seeing anyone — I am, but it’s casual and has no future, because he also doesn’t want kids. Then I asked him the same question. He told me he met someone online, they went on a couple of dates, and he kept saying how amazing, lovely, and gorgeous she is. He talked about her job, where she’s from, how great she looks, that she used to model, etc.

I was listening, trying to keep a straight face while my heart sank. I feel so hurt, replaced, and even angry at him for telling me all this. At the same time, I know it’s life and people move on, but I’m struggling with how to cope with hearing about his new ‘relationship’ so soon after we broke up.

Die Fed hielt die Zinsen, zugleich rutschte das Verbrauchervertrauen auf ein Mehrjahrestief (WSJ, NYT, Fox Business).
* Global — Gold ist in 12 Monaten um rund 95% gestiegen, Silber um etwa 270%. Über Nacht gab es neue Ausschläge, da Anleger in sichere Häfen wechseln (Fed-Unsicherheit, geopolitische Schlagzeilen). Kupfer und Öl schwanken stark – ein Signal für straffere Finanzbedingungen und steigendes Inputkosten-Risiko (Bloomberg, MarketWatch).
* FX/Crypto — Der Dollar-Index liegt nahe einem Vierjahrestief nach dem stärksten Tagesrutsch seit 2025. Das belastet US-Assets und stützt die CHF-Nachfrage. Bitcoin fiel auf ein Zweimonatstief, nachdem Spekulationen über einen restriktiveren („hawkish“) neuen Fed-Chef Risk-Assets drücken (WSJ, Reuters, Investopedia).
* Asia/EM — Der CEO der indonesischen Börse trat nach einem Ausverkauf von rund 80 Mrd. US-$ zurück, der mit einer drohenden MSCI-Herabstufung verknüpft ist. Das unterstreicht die Fragilität der EM-Risikostimmung, während Daten aus Japan und Australien die globale Zinsvolatilität hoch halten (Reuters, CNBC).

**SPEKULATIVE POSITIONIERUNG**

* Index-Optionsflüsse: Calls dominieren weiter gegenüber Puts. Put/Call-Volumenverhältnis bei \~0,43, Put/Call Open Interest bei \~0,23. Das spricht für einen weiterhin bullischen Bias – trotz steigender Kurzfrist-Hedges in Mega-Cap-Tech (Stocknear Options Flow, Datenstand 29.01.).
* Sektor-Optionsbudgets: Technologie bleibt klar vorn. KI- und Cloud-Leader schluckten zuletzt >10 Mrd. US-$ an Prämie, Defensives deutlich weniger – ein überfüllter Growth-Trade, obwohl Software volatil bleibt (Stocknear Sector Flow).
* Fear & Greed bei 62 („Greed“) – passt zu Dip-Buying in US-Aktien, auch wenn Fed-Chef, Zölle und KI-Capex intraday weiter für Ausschläge sorgen (Multi-Source Sentiment Composite).

**MAG7 COVERAGE**

* [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA) — Nahe $192,51 (gestern ca. +0,5%). China genehmigt H200-Verkäufe unter Auflagen, Nvidia treibt einen $105M-AI-Hub in Taiwan voran. Große Dark-Pool-Prints (bis \~300k Aktien) plus gemischte Long-Dated-Call-Spreads und Schutz-Puts im Front-Month zeigen: Institutionelle halten KI-Optimismus, sichern aber kurzfristige Volatilität ab (Reuters, Benzinga, Stocknear Dark-Pool/Options).
* [AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) — Um $258,01 (+0,6%) nach einem Rekord-Q1 mit 16% Umsatzwachstum und „staggering“ iPhone-Nachfrage. Massive Schlussauktion-Blöcke >$1,8 Mrd. notional und aktives Upside-Call-Buying ($260–$270) deuten auf Akkumulation nach den Quartalszahlen; parallel verarbeitet der Markt eine Gemini-gestützte Siri-Neuauflage und eine starke China-Erholung (Reuters, WSJ, Stocknear Dark-Pool/Options).
* [MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT) — Nahe $433,50 (gestern etwa -10%) nach Cloud/KI-Beat, aber langsamerem Azure-Wachstum und Rekord-KI-Capex; größter One-Day-Value-Wipeout seit 2020. Optionsflow: viele kurzfristige, tief im Geld liegende Put-Blöcke rund um $475–$500 dominieren. Mehrmillionen-Aktienblöcke nahe den Tiefs wirken wie erste Value-Käufe (CNBC, Bloomberg, Stocknear Options & Blocks).
* [AMZN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMZN) — Um $241,73 (leicht -0,5%). Der Kurs verarbeitet Meldungen zu \~16k Entlassungen, Schließungen von Fresh/Go-Stores und Berichte, Amazon könne bis zu $50 Mrd. in OpenAI investieren. Dark-Pool-Käufe nahe $240 und bullische Call-Spreads Richtung Quartalszahlen am 05.02. sprechen dafür, dass Investoren auf AWS-KI-Wachstum und margenträchtigeren Retail-Mix schauen (WSJ, CNBC, Stocknear Flow).
* [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL) — Um $338,25 (+0,7%, neues 52-Wochen-Hoch). Regulierer in UK und EU drängen auf breiteren Zugang zu Gemini und KI-Daten; Google nimmt ein großes Proxy-Botnet auseinander. Große Schlussauktion-Blöcke >$1,4 Mrd. notional und stetige Call-Akkumulation bis 2027 deuten auf Vertrauen, dass KI-getriebene Search- und Cloud-Dynamik den jüngsten Run bis zu den Quartalszahlen am 04.02. trägt (Reuters, CMA, Stocknear Dark-Pool/Options).
* [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META) — Nahe $738,31 (ca. +10,4%) nach Q4: Umsatz +24%, KI-basiertes Ad-Targeting hebt Margen, obwohl die Capex-Guidance für 2026 auf bis zu $135 Mrd. steigt. Auffällige Call-Blöcke (Mai & 2027) im Bereich $730–$800 plus >$2 Mrd. Schlussauktion-Blöcke im Underlying zeigen: sichtbare KI-Erträge werden belohnt, trotz massiver Infrastruktur-Ausgaben (WSJ, Bloomberg, Stocknear Options/Dark-Pool).
* [TSLA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA) — Um $416,56 (ca. -3,5%). Tesla meldet den ersten jährlichen Umsatzrückgang, schlägt aber Q4-EPS und bekräftigt >$20 Mrd. Capex-Plan für 2026 (Robotaxis, humanoide Roboter); gleichzeitig wird Model S/X eingestellt. Optionsflow wirkt „Barbell“: schwere OTM-Downside-Put-Blöcke ($550–$650, Feb–März) plus nennenswerte Long-Dated-Upside-Calls – Positionierung rund um Musks „Physical AI“-Pivot und mögliche SpaceX/xAI-Verknüpfungen (Reuters, CNBC, Stocknear Options & Blocks).

* Tech / AI Infra — [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META): Reiterates (Deepak Mathivanan) auf Overweight, Kursziel $860 (\~+16,5%). Fokus: beschleunigte KI-gestützte Werbeumsätze, frühe Optionalität über bezahlte KI-Services und AR-Brillen (Street Research / Stocknear).

Unterm Strich sprechen Options-, Dark-Pool- und News-Flow für „Risk-on“, aber selektiver als noch vor ein paar Wochen: Institutionelle rotieren innerhalb von KI (Plattform-Leader wie [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META), [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA), [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL) werden bevorzugt), während die am stärksten gelaufenen, capex-intensiven Ecken in Software eher taktisch gemieden werden. Kurzfristig: neutral bis konstruktiv für US-Aktien – Fokus auf KI-Infrastruktur-Gewinner und hochwertige Zykliker; Finanzierung über das Reduzieren überfüllter, hoch bewerteter Software- und EV-Teile, wo Enttäuschungen am teuersten wären.

1qr09dy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qr09dy,Your thoughts?,"Tomorrow I’ll be able to get another 5 star, but I’m not quite sure who to pick. Apart from this, I also need a 3rd team.

Right now, I have enough to guarantee Skirk and I plan on pulling for her, but I’m unsure if I’ll be able to get both her and Coffee.

The 5 stars I currently have are:

Flins, Columbina (C1R0), Ineffa, Furina (C0R1), Nahida, Navia, Arlecchino, Neuvillette, Raiden, Mizuki, Tighnari, Jean, Mona, and Dehya (C2).

And of course, Bennett 👍🏻

At the moment, I can consistently clear Abyss up to 12-3 and usually get 30+ stars. I can also occasionally beat Menacing. This patch, I was able to 36 star IT (10/10) and beat Menacing for the first time.

My main teams are:

• Flins, Columbina, Ineffa, Sucrose

• Neuvillette, Nahida, Raiden, Furina

Occasionally I swap Neuvillette or Flins with Navia or Arlecchino.

My C6 four stars are Fischl, Noelle, Ifa (our glorious 5 year old king), and Hatsune Miku.

I’m afraid I do not own a maiden named Cookie unfortunately.

I’m also unsure who I should pull for between Varka and Skirk. I have C6 Faruzan, though I mostly just use her with Anemo Traveler to clear Whimpering Wastes and ToA.

And yes, I am a Flins main. My apologies for the crude grammar.

My uncle was the type to guy to take the shirt off his back to anyone. He was one of the sweetest and the kindest man you would ever meet. He was basically every younger person's uncle. Anyway, It was January of 2021 a whole month after he died. Me and my sister were showering at his house since no one lived there at the time and we had the run his water and flush the toilets so basically all the basic household needs.

Me and my sister were sitting on the couch talking about how all the memories and how we can't come here when renters come etc. Well all of a sudden, we hear a fly. Like a normal black fly that is harmless. It's January in the coldest state ever. The active fly rates are super low. So, hearing a fly and seeing a fly is RARE. So this is where things get crazy. Me and my sister are still just going down nostalgia lane and all of a sudden, the fly lands on my leg. I look at the fly and think the same thing everyone else was thinking ""HOW THE HELL WAS THERE A FLY IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING JANUARY?""

So, as a joke not actually expecting anything to happen, I start talking to the fly saying stuff like ""If you're my uncle and you love me fly up."" HE FLEW UP IM DEAD ASS IT LISTENED LIKE IT WAS A DOG! Then I was like maybe it's a coincidence so I said ""If your my uncle land on my thigh."" IT LANDED ON MY THIGH RIGHT AFTER I SAID THAT. Me still being in disbelief I said ""If your my uncle land on the coffee table."" HE FREAKING LANDED ON THE TABLE! IT WAS LIKE I TRAINED THIS DAMN FLY TO LISTEN TO MY EVERY COMMAND!!!

Me and my sister were sitting there in disbelief this all happened because 1st of all how did the fly just listen to me and 2nd of all I COULD TOUCH THE FLY! LIKE PET IT AND IT NEVER MOVED IT JUST LET ME TOUCH IT AND MOVE IT! FLYS ARE THE JUMPIEST THINGS EVER IF YOU JUST MAKE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT NEAR THEM, THEY FREAK OUT! When we left that night, we said ""goodbye uncle D we love you.""

Every other week when we went to the house. We looked up and down for the damn fly but suddenly there was no flies ever found. That's how I believe it had to be him because where the hell did the fly go?! Then we told our mom. She believed us. But everyone else we told said we were just sad and delusional, but I genuinely think it was my uncle saying goodbye to me and my sister.",22,1769763101.0,confessions,7,0.79,False

* US — President Trump said he will name a replacement for Fed Chair Powell this morning, stoking volatility in rates and tech as markets reassess the path of policy after the Fed held rates and consumer confidence slid to multi-year lows (WSJ, NYT, Fox Business). 
* Global — Gold has surged roughly 95% over 12 months and silver about 270%, with fresh spikes overnight as investors seek havens amid Fed uncertainty and geopolitical headlines, while copper and oil whipsaw, signaling tighter financial conditions and higher input-cost risk (Bloomberg, MarketWatch). 
* FX/Crypto — The dollar index sits near a four-year low after its worst one-day drop since 2025, pressuring US assets and boosting CHF demand, while Bitcoin slid to a two-month low as speculation over a more hawkish incoming Fed chair hits risk assets (WSJ, Reuters, Investopedia).

* Financials / Insurance — [PGR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/PGR) Maintains by Elyse Greenspan to Equal-Weight with $220 PT (\~5.7% upside), as strong pricing power is balanced by concerns that margins are near cycle peaks (Stocknear). 
* Industrials / Aerospace — [TXT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TXT) Maintains by Seth Seifman to Neutral with $90 PT (\~2.5% upside), reflecting steady defense and aviation demand but limited near-term re-rating potential (Stocknear). 
* Logistics / Transport — [LSTR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/LSTR) Maintains by Lucas Servera to Hold with $145 PT (\~-3.3% downside), as soft freight volumes and pricing offset longer-term operating discipline (Stocknear). 
* Biotech — [MNPR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MNPR) Maintains by Keay Nakae to Buy with $100 PT (\~48.5% upside), framed as high-risk/high-reward oncology exposure with multiple upcoming data catalysts (Stocknear). 
* Small-Cap Financials — [GBFH](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GBFH) Maintains by Matthew Erdner to Buy with $50 PT (\~56.5% upside), on asset-sensitive balance-sheet leverage to higher rates and improving credit metrics (Stocknear).

  
Overall, options, dark-pool, and news flow point to a still risk-on but more selective tape: institutional money is rotating within AI (favoring platform leaders like [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META), [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA), [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL)) while tactically fading the most extended software and capex-heavy names. Near-term stance: neutral-to-constructive on US equities, with a preference for AI infrastructure winners and high-quality cyclicals, funded by trimming crowded, high-multiple corners of software and EVs where expectations are most vulnerable to disappointment.

Chat GPT translation...**January 29, 2023**

We went to visit the boys. There was ice cream at the shop, so we bought some; from home we took coffee, and also a few of the books written by Nzhdeh.

There was a bit of gas in the Niva; we climbed up from Karvin, reached the boys, put on the coffee, went into the trench, and saw the situation—how the boys were digging the trench, working with one pick and one hammer, carving the trench by hand.

My Maral and Marine were with us too—we were all together—and the trench was barely deep enough in many places even for one-year-old Maral.

We went into the dugout, drank coffee, they asked about our Diaspora Armenians, and so on… We asked whether, if we brought a tool, they could dig the trench with it… though we all know it wasn’t being done with machinery… I said I don’t know the Russian names of these tools—there’s something at Vrej’s supermarket, that thing that goes “thak-thak-thak” and breaks stone… a perforator / jackhammer (that’s what we learned)… “If I bring one of those myself, can you do something with it?” …but what about electricity… He said he would bring the generator, if I’m not mistaken the soldier from Majkalashen, but there was no gasoline… At home, the only fuel I had was my ten liters, which I had set aside since the beginning of the blockade for an emergency or for the moment a child might be born… The boys said, bring it—you’ll be doing a good thing.

We got into the Niva and realized we had forgotten to give the ice cream to the boys. The boys came to the window and brought several cans of condensed milk for little Maral; no matter how much we refused, it didn’t work.

We went down by Onik’s post to the lower position—apparently 133. It was a very bad spot; the Turk seemed to be sitting right above their heads… Greetings, good day—we gave a few books, drank coffee, and left.

Vrej at Puregh Supermarket helped. Every day I was on some other strange errand. Everyone kept asking, “So you’re not going to America now?” And I would say I’m bringing people to Artsakh—what going anywhere… He didn’t ask much more.

I brought the perforator myself, took the gasoline from home to the boys, and said I’d tell Aznavour to bring you more gasoline… I’ll write about this another day…

The boys needed a few other things too—again there was an opportunity to go. They said it works well—well done.

Many of the boys are not here today. Few people know what battles took place in Artsakh, and how heroically the sons of Armenians fought…

My wife and children have always been calm and safe because they personally visited the positions and our brave men who defend our country and our nation.

They understood who and what stood behind them, and they proved it in the unequal struggle they fought.

Forgive us—we haven’t done enough, and even now we still aren’t doing enough.

Our generation must resolve the reckoning.

**Glory and honor to our heroes.**

1qqzxiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyadvice/comments/1qqzxiz/new_to_this_and_need_advice_in_a_major_way/,New to this and need advice in a major way!,"Ok. I'm 36. New to this city in NM. Haven't dated in a few years. Finally decided to ask this girl out that worked down the road from my house. She flirted with me everyday, her eyes told me she wanted me to ask her out constantly.  I created a gameplan. I did a badass drawing for her and hid my number in the drawing so that she would see it after I left and then the ball would be in her court and I'd wait on her to text me or not. I Felt great about it, but long story short, I go to her work on Monday after drawing all weekend and she quit her job before I was able to give it to her! In my frustration I made a tinder.
 I matched with this really stunningly beautiful amazingly attractive sexy as hell mom of 3. Youngest is 2 months. Other are 3 and 5. That's irrelevant IG. Anyways. She turned me on in ways I didn't know possible right away! I told her to text me after we broke the ice with a few messages. She did, and We communicated smooth as silk, the conversation was both fun and entertaining. We quickly got to feeling some type of way for eachother. 
So then she tells me that she's married and that her and her husband rarely get out on dates and he's cool with her having a side boyfriend. If I'm down with that cool, but she needs to let me know. (They have some other things going on behind the scenes that makes it more complicated for her and him to date bc someone always has to be home with the kids.) She had a side bf on the west coast for 7 months and they split up bc she had to move. She tells me she strictly is of course loyal to her husband above all and that she wants to have only one bf on the side and that that person could maybe be me. I tell her only time will tell let's not overthink and just enjoy the adventure for now. She elaborates that she has tried to find someone here in the past but noone knew how to take care of her in the bedroom right. Then she got pregnant with her husband again and stayed away from dating the past year during her pregnancy. So supposedly I'm one of the new runners up since she decided to get her feet wet again. I don't know what other competition I'm going against, or if there is any, I honestly don't care lol..i tell her I'm down to give the whole thing a trial run at least bc she really turns me on and I like her a lot as a human being too. She's honest and shes a great mom and all in all she's just got a personality that I really love. She's an amazing make up artist, she's funny, she's sexier then words can express, she's fun. But part of me wonders if she's just a sex addict, or if she's having trouble in paradise and it's all a big lie and she's getting payback on her dude for cheating maybe? Just being a realest. lmao.  For what it's worth I believe her about everything. But is that just me trying to be hopeful or? Anyways We get on for the past week really hot and heavy thru texts. Sun up to sundown some days. With a perfect Healthy balance of friendship building and naughty fantasies of what we would like to do to eachother in the near future, tons of sexy pictures. She tells me she's reading a book called ""the ethical slut"" =] I bought it and read it all in the past couple days to learn more about poly since I'm new to it. I've had 3 somes with females plenty of times but never dated another man's wife (with his permission. 😂) she wakes me up to good vibes and naughty pictures in her kitchen bent over the counter daily. I love it!! We finally had plans to meet on a Wednesday after talking for a week. Tuesday the day before, she tells me that she's by my house, and I talk her into coming over to break the ice and kiss me =]. She pulls up outside my house and I go out there, and she was kinda nervous, but we enjoyed a couple good kisses and some quick casual conversation. She has her newborn kid in the backseat and she's getting fussy and crying a lil, so she had to bounce kinda quick,( b4 things could escalate anymore lol.) But it was really nice and spontaneous and we had plans for coffee the next day still maybe, she said her and her and her husband had morning plans, but she'd let me know when she made it home and wed figure out coffee thing tomorrow.
 Ok so next day.  She hits me up around 1. I tell her how my day's going. She says a friend's over and that they're having a chill day with the kids. I woke up to go work on a homies gfs car to make enough money to buy a room at the Hilton Incase the coffee date turned into us irresistibly ready to fuck lol. Which was my intention. If I'm gonna be the side bf for sex I might as well do it in style right? Even if it was just gonna be a few hours I was gonna buy a nice room and not take her back to my place with roommates in bedrooms next to mine 🤣. She doesn't bring up our coffee date, and I wasn't stressing it at all. Kissing her made my week. =]  I got the patience of a monk.
Today (Thursday) we messaged. when I woke up and looked at my phone for the time she messaged me, it was like she was able to know the second I woke up! It tripped me out! But her message was sexy af. our ritual of her morning counter picture, and we talked all morning about art and it always turns to us talking naughty somehow lol after a few hours after we signed off, I drew her a badass graffiti drawing of her name and sent it to her. She said she loved it. We stopped texting around 3. Her husband leaves for work around 8pm and she was tired today, and didn't message me at all tonight. She's so swamped with everything I'm glad when she gets to rest. But we are talking about this possibly being long lasting, after I prove I can take care of her in bed lol no worries in my world about that.
 Im realizing upon thinking on it that im the type to not want a full-time gf rn anyways. I need to have the me time to take care of personal goals, be able to make money, and not be controlled at every moment. A part time gf seems to be the perfect answer. I Still get a bit of emotional attachment, still have a great sex life, but be able to be me at the same time. I go to school, like to snowboard, ride streetbikes, go to recovery meetings, (I'm sober and have been for a decent amount of time), my love of my life passed away to cancer and I took the time to heal properly for a couple years, then last year my dad got sick with cancer and I moved here from Oregon to take care of him on hospice, I nursed him out of the world. I'm here all alone now. I'm in a new city and want someone meaningful in my life. I thrive with a badass gf by my side. My lover that passed was everything to me. We took each other's virginity in highschool, were always best friends whether we were dating or not, and our love life when it was on was phenomenal. I want that again really bad. With this new poly girl I'm talking to, in ways she turns me on even more then my lover did. She has the sexiest personality ever. I mean personality out the ying yang. I read ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"" and know about Erika birger and her marriage with Gregor and how she loved Mikael blomkvist on the side, and I can be Mikael blomkvist!!!! ""It takes the soul of an artist to realize that a woman's sexual and emotional needs may be needed from more then one source."" Not every man brings the same things to the table. Lmao. The book ""the ethical slut"" taught me a lot the past couple days also. I figured I may need to learn all I can about this if I'm going to try and have an emotional investment with this woman I'm learning to like more and more by the day. 
Her husband is supposedly the one who talked her into finding someone else to date. She was nervous at first she said. But now she wants it. He would casually go fuck other girls in the past just for fun with no strings attached IG. But she likes the relationship aspect. 
The thing I was hesitant to talk about earlier was why it's complicated for them to get out. One of their kids has a heartbreaking medical condition with constant surgeries taking place, and they're going through a lot of turmoil and stress with the entire situation. Understandably.. I wish I could take away all of their pain and take the sickness for the lil guy.  But he needs constant care. So her husband is able to watch him while she can break away a few hours to date. He wants her to be satisfied. I salute the guy. He works full time. They're truly inspirational to me. She has a lot on her plate. 3 kids, a husband, and caring for all of them, and craving a bf to be with with another slot she wants filled by me maybe.

 I would do everything in my power to make her life easier and better and be nothing but a force of positivity to her life. An ear for her to talk to, a shoulder to lean on, a lover for her to stand by. A person to spoil her. Every move I made would be with her in the back of my mind. I'm tempted to go back to work rn instead of waiting the 2 months for my liscense. I do high paying electrical work and my liscense is imperative to my job, but I can do something else a couple months until I get it back. I have enough money to survive and date comfortably already, but having the extra to make sure she's good and extra taken care of is already crossing my mind lol. I want to be the man she dreams of as her side bf. I want her to feel special bc she deserves it. I provide. Always have, always will, for the girl I care for that has my back.

 I need advice tho. I'm hesitant to text her first bc I don't want to intrude. Or seem desperate. I'm not stressing on finding a gf at all, but I like this girl more then any other one that's crossed my path. And that's saying a lot. I've had a great run thru life so far so that's speaking volumes when I say that. 

 How often should I be satisfied with seeing her? Couple times a week? How do I make this have the best chance of working? Does this have the potential to keep my attention long-term or am I going to crave someone more present in the future? How do u make it seem like the relationship is evolving? Bc I'll always be 2nd place. Never get the move in together, or get a place together, or have kids together. I'm a Gameboy on the shelf that gets played and put down to collect dust for however long until she want to pick it up again lol. 

I want to meet other people that have experience in similar relationships. Please help and give me some pointers. Thanks for your time =] ",0,1769761911.0,polyadvice,15,0.5,False
1qqzwcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qqzwcy/aitah_my_boyfriend_brings_his_dog_everywhere/,AITAH My boyfriend brings his dog everywhere,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) moved to the US a little over a year ago without his dog (we’ll call him “Z”) who lived with his family in a rural area. A few months into our relationship, he brought Z over to the states.

Z is a yapper, which I initially chalked up to him adjusting to the city life. However, after a year here, Z still barks at everything. It’s constant. My boyfriend says it doesn’t bother him, but he’s aware it bothers other people so he will tell Z to stop. Z will keep barking and lunging at other dogs/people until they’re out of sight.

We live in a city with lots of dogs and lots of parks and outdoor areas to take them to. Now, I’m a dog person. I have a dog who I love very much. And at first, it was fun to do all these activities with our dogs all the time. That being said, I understand that not everyone wants to be around dogs all the time. Restaurants are one of those places.

My boyfriend brings his dog EVERYWHERE. Every single date, he shows up with his dog. Even if it’s a nice restaurant with no outdoor seating. I tell him it’s not really considerate to bring dogs into a nice restaurant, and he says it’s okay because his dog is a “service animal”. I said it’s not a service animal and he knows that. I’ve told him it makes me uncomfortable to abuse this loophole because I don’t want to ruin it for the people who actually need their dogs there.

But of course, there will be a few overly nice people who then ask to pet Z or say he’s cute and then my bf basically thinks he’s doing something nice for the public. I see the glares. I know a majority of the restaurant does not want a dog there. And don’t get me started on when Z barks inside. It makes me cringe. My bf says he can’t leave Z at home because he barks constantly when left alone and the neighbors have complained multiple times.

Z also likes to sit in the passenger seat of the car. Every time we go on an adventure with the dogs (usually a few times a week), my dog sits in the back and then I hold his 20 pound dog in my lap. This is partially my fault, because at first I didn’t really mind so it became part of our routine. However, since we live in the Bay Area, lots of our adventures involve water.

When we get in the car to leave, he will invite his wet dog to get on my lap. The first time he did this, I was appalled. He quickly apologized. Then he got a towel to put under Z so that Z could keep sitting on my lap. I was in shock and didn’t know what to say.

Unsurprisingly, my clothes ended up getting wet and covered in fur, which I showed him afterwards and he just laughed it off. I’m not one to get all worked up over some wet clothes so I let it go. But the second time it happened, I was prepared. I said can’t Z just sit in the back with my dog? He says it’s too chaotic if Z is in the back with my dog and he’s scared Z will get hurt.

My bf also refuses to leave the dogs in the car together with the windows cracked if we need to make any sort of quick stop to get coffee, sandwiches, etc. so his dog will come inside with us while my dog stays in the car.

Keep in mind, it never gets above 70 degrees here. The dogs are totally fine to be left for 10 minutes.

I’ve noticed this confuses my dog, who is very pack-oriented and sensitive. She will act clingy with me afterwards, like she feels left out. It makes me sad and feel like I’m a bad owner, but I don’t want to bring her inside and say she’s a service animal when she’s not. When I brought this up to my bf he said he doesn’t think it’s that deep.

When we sleep at my bf’s apartment, Z immediately jumps into bed with us and sleeps right at our thighs. It makes me uncomfortable to have a dog literally touching me while having sex. If I say something, my bf will move Z a few inches over and then Z comes right back. Recently, we were having sex and when he went down on me I started freaking out thinking it was the dog. It wasn’t, but it made me realize just how CONSTANTLY this dog is in my personal space. It’s a huge turn off.

I love my boyfriend. He has so many positive traits and treats me really well otherwise. I am a huge animal lover, and would so much rather be with a man who loves his dog a little too much than not enough. But I feel like I’m going crazy. AITAH? It’s making me not want to be around dogs at all, even my own dog (who I absolutely adore). Has anyone else been in a similar situation? If so, how did you handle it?",1,1769761791.0,AITAH,10,0.67,False

Shuoer has been churning a few planar sets and their S12 lineup has had critical acclaim for being a well rounded product to most, but also received critique and notes of improvement for further refinement of the highly technical sound that they are fabled for, and today in my hands I have the S12 Ultra and this review shall reflect my happiness in reviewing this wonderful planar set.

Unpacking the S12 Ultra felt professional- no annoying waifu branding, clear advertisement of the product Shuoer is offering, minimal graphics and as I lift the lid, it feels familiar- the S12 ultras sitting in the foam laden compartment and below that, a screwdown circular case that houses the cable which is modular and feels premium- the connectors are locked via a screw mechanism, 2 sets of grey and clear silicone eartips that actually are decent but the most welcoming element in here was the inclusion of a CX31993 chipped DT-01 pro dac from Shuoer. For my casual usage, this dac powered the iems good enough but I focus primarily on the IEMs themselves but for people who actually want an all inclusive package in a reasonable price, the inclusion of this dac with the S12 ultra is a welcome step from Shuoer.

Enough talk, here is the sound:

**Lows:** the S12 ultra has a smooth yet powerful presentation in the sub-bass and quite prominently so. It reaches deep, the impact is bold and powerful but a little more sustenance would not have hurt and this was uniform no matter which eartips I used. It does have a groveling rumbling delivery but all I wanted was to sustain it a bit more and bring it home.

tracks like Daft Punk’s *Get Lucky, Instant Crush* and Rush’s *Limelight*, the S12 ultra has a restrained yet meticulous painting in terms of delivering detail where I could distinctly hear the plucking and the switcheroo of notes as the tracks progressed and the S12 ultra held its composure through the busy sections with relative ease. Things got more enjoyable as the kick drums and toms actually saw more life in Limelight where the groveling bass notes felt coherent with how the drums were reacting, creating a very promising synchronised effort into keeping the sound fun.

Again, I would have appreciated a bit more reach in making the delivery very powerful but for those who are looking for a bass that does not hurt yet remains plenty enough in quality and quantity, the S12 ultra here is a very strong recommendation.

**Mids:** Even here, this set continues to impress me and much more than its predecessors, specially the S12 Pro where it just felt like the valley has flooded and sunk into obscurity, the S12 ultra instead with its wider stage, great instrument separation and imaging restores the same sunken valley into its past glory.

In tracks like The Police’s *Message in a Bottle* and Tool’s *Pneuma*, the S12 Ultra behaved in a calm, composed manner and did not show overenthusiasm in delivering both the vocals and the rest of the elements together. As I spent more time with this set, I realised that the vocals do not feel as laid back as they were initially observed and that it carries within itself a good amount of energy into bringing it to the forefront yet just stops shy of being too on the nose. 

Tonality remains consistent although sometimes perceived to be minutely dry, as I could feel through the cymbals on *Pneuma* but what made me like the S12 ultra so much was that timbre despite being a planar felt very natural, while separation once again was commendable.

**Highs:** This is where the S12 Ultra sets itself apart from its predecessors and for a good reason, it's super smooth for the good part and it rises through peaks in vocals very well which I observed in tracks like Adele's Easy On Me and Celine Dion’s All By Myself where I never felt even for a moment that I observed shrillness and pierce even when the tracks had their climactic highs. Once again, vocals even with the dynamics and vibratos were very natural and lush in their tonality, and timbre once again remained intact.

In tracks like Kendrick Lamar’s Alright, the horns and cymbals had beautiful coherence and the timbre of the horns especially stayed true in its nature, while carrying a good amount of weight. However, the background vocals felt slightly obscure as the S12 Ultra handled the clipper cymbals like it should and being on the beat.

**Concluding notes:** the S12 Ultra I feel, is Shuoer’s actual home run in its line-up and giving the market a planar that can handle all genres without distinction and is a safe bet for something that has everything premium, even the sound. Adding a healthy assortment of stock eartips that surprisingly sound decent, with their DT01 pro dac that performs decent and supplies this IEM with enough power and a well built cable with modular jacks sweetens the deal so good that it's a great starting point without any concerning compromises where I feel you don't need to buy anything else with it.

However, the S12 Ultra felt itself playing too safe if I had to compare it with one of my favourite planar IEMs of all time, the Tangzu Zetian Wu Heyday where the Heyday had so much energy through the lows which could be described as controlled chaos in the best, and even though the Heyday has a comparatively narrower stage, it carries in itself considerably more detail while showing the market that a good tuning remains good despite changing and evolving market trends. The S12 ultra has a remarkable control over the sound which does not discriminate across genres, but if folks like a brighter sound and retain the planar bass, my choice would be the Heyday over the Ultra.

The S12 ultra actually felt a step above compared to sets like the Crinear Daybreak as the bass on the S12 Ultra came off as plenty without overdoing it which was a problem on the Daybreak and when I compare it to the Lush, the S12 feels brighter and slightly fatiguing where the Lush felt safer and smoother. But if you were to ask me, if I didn't have the Heyday I would be seeing myself as an owner of the S12 Ultra alongside my Lush and with that, I give the S12 Ultra an A+
