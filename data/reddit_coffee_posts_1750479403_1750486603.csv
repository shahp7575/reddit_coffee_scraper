1lgpoxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1lgpoxy/help_needed_insomniaanxiety/,Help needed (Insomnia/anxiety),"I (18F) have started struggling with sleep for the last week or so. For context, i haven't been diagnosed with anything related to anxiety, depression, autism, insomnia etc, but everytime i do sort of dumb down my problems to those things. Continuing with that, i may show signs of all those three, and right now, it's the last one that has really started bothering me. 

About a week or so ago, on tge night between june 10th and june 11th i slept for a total of two hours. I did what i always have, ""get ready"" for bed at around 23.15, after scrolling on my phone just like i always do, especially now more so than when i have school or work. I can't remember much details from that night, except how i tossed and turned around for hours. I have a tendency to get frustrated/extremely anxious when things don't go my way or the ""way i've planned"", and sleep is an extremely crucial one. Eventually, after sweating my ahh off, almost crying, hitting myself on the head and hearing my own heart beat a million miles per hour for literal hours, it was my dad who woke up at around 4-5. I of course, went to talk to him just to gain some semblance of sanity, and he ofc said some corny stuff like ""Just close your eyes"" ""Sometimes you say you haven't slept when you actually have"" and whatnot. After that enlightening experience and all the anxiety and frustration i felt, i went back to bed at around 5 am and slept till 7.25. 
My specific timing for waking up has to do with my need for maintaining a ""routine"" in my life. I'll set an alarm, i don't care if it's summer, winter, or the end of the world, these routines are what help me gain some sense of control in my life when nothing else feels right. 

Anyways, the next morning i didn't have my daily morning coffee, or really any coffee at all. I avoided it, and just thought caffeine must be what's causing it. Again, i can't remember much of how the last few nights since then have went like, except the fact that it sort of became an almost nightly cycle. I try to go to bed before 23, feel like i'll fall asleep, try and fall asleep, but my thoughts or other environmental factors just don't make it possible. 

My room feels hot, or then it's just me sweating, my legs occasionally twitch, and my head feels loud. Like, every single thing i heard during the day; people talking, music, youtube videos, games, it ALL plays in my head way too loudly. And the moment all that disappears, some fuckass bird outside starts making noise and i just feel a deep sense of terror. At some point, i think 15th of june, i took my first ever melatonin. It was a 1,9mg and it did help me, and i think i did get atleast 7 hours of sleep. Well, the next few days haven't been much better. The next day i also took melatonin, only to wake up a few times at night but hell, i'd say that's better than nothing. 
For me, even getting 6 hours of sleep sounds like something i need.
But i feel like i can't sleep. 

My eyes may feel heavy at 22, ans i'll tell myself, ""I'll go to bed, obv i'm tired"". I get in, or ON the bed with my day clothes ans duvet thingy on just so i could trick myself into believing changing things up will help, but it's my brain. 
Everything feels so loud, my thoughts go all over the place with or without melatonin, or magnesium supplements, or anything. 

This is super long but i'll be ready to answer to any comments for extra context/ info because i can't put it all on here. ",1,1750486483.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1lgpoqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/comments/1lgpoqf/recovered_from_harm_ocd/,Recovered from Harm OCD,"I wanted to share my experience with Harm OCD — how it started, how it evolved, and most importantly, how I got better. I hope this can give someone out there some hope, because I remember how terrifying it felt when I was in the thick of it.

**How it started:** For context I have never had OCD in my life until march of 2025. About 3 months ago, I had decided to drink coffee in the late evening and then try to go to sleep. When I was lying in bed trying to sleep I began having racing thoughts and then I had a random intrusive thought pop into my head — something violent and completely out of character for me. It wasn’t something I’d *ever* want to do, but it hit me like a ton of bricks. The thought kept repeating, over and over all night. And it took almost 2 months for me to get over that one thought. Initially the OCD would be words or phrases that would repeat over and over if I thought of them. 

**The spiral:** That single thought morphed into other forms: images, ""daring"" thoughts (“What if I just hit that person?”), even physical tension. It would show up especially when I was near people — loved ones, strangers, anyone. My brain turned everyday situations into testing grounds for these negative thoughts. I felt like I was living in “manual mode,” constantly scanning my mind for danger. I'd get anxious just from wondering, *“Am I still having the thought?”.* I also began having mental compulsions where every time I would walk past someone I would have to say in my head, “Kill him/her”. I would also have thoughts of making negative comments about myself that were really annoying.

The worst part? I wasn’t sleeping. I’d get 2–3 hours a night, feel nauseous in the mornings, and sometimes even vomit from the anxiety. I had panic attacks at work. 

**The turning point:** Eventually, I realized something crucial:  *I was afraid of being afraid.* The anxiety was no longer just about the content of the thoughts — it was about the fear of the thoughts returning, morphing, or getting worse. I was in a loop of checking, analyzing, and mentally “testing” myself.

I started focusing less on *what* I was thinking and more on *how* I was relating to the thoughts. I practiced noticing the thoughts and letting them be there without engaging — no arguing, no analyzing, no reassurance-seeking.

**How I got better:**

* **I stopped trying to feel “100% safe”** — and accepted that thoughts are just thoughts.  
* **I let the thoughts get boring** — I stopped reacting, and they lost their emotional punch. If an intrusive thought came up I would generally dismiss it as being boring/uninteresting 
* **I reminded myself: “I don’t control what thoughts show up, but I control how I respond.”**  
* **I** ***stopped tracking progress obsessively*** — That was key. Trying to “measure” recovery kept me stuck.

One of the most frustrating parts of the whole thing is that the recovery process is not linear. It often would get worse and then get better and then worse again. I would get really scared wondering when it would finally go away, thinking that it could possibly go on for the rest of my life. It eventually hit a peak and then about 4 weeks after now it almost went away entirely. The main advice I would give someone is that there isn't much you can do about this problem other than wait it out, so don’t stress yourself out thinking that you’re doing something wrong. The only medication I took was ativan 1mg and melatonin a few times to help with the insomnia, but now I just take magnesium glycinate for sleep. The main resources I used were talking to Chat GPT and YouTube Nathan Peterson videos, but don’t excessively read about OCD or watch too many videos because it’ll probably make you focus on it even more.

Can't swim in the beach because of toxic debris that's run off from tbe Palisades Fire.

No other fellow Bruins around. 

Had dressed up to go say hello to some friends who couldn't make it where were going to meet at the last minute. Spilled hot coffee near my balls while sitting down and even yelled ""ouch, my dick!"" hoping nobody heard me. I felt so bad after that.

But we just need to take a moment, accept how things are, while we're here. This too shall pass. I just hope better days are to come and that I don't allow the inner sadness that's a part of me when I saw many parents take my friends away from here and out of our lives as alumni. 

Here at my apartment tonight as I live to tell. Just like the Madonna song, Live to Tell. That song is so sad and it's reflective of the uncertainty of how I'm going to make this a fun summer, as productive as I want it to be for school and beyond. 


At least there's some fruit at the market. I want some fruit right now. Where's Frutas El Chapin food cart? I have a late night food craving. Finna check to see if any markets are open. Everywhere I go, I am reminded of a fond memory. But when you stay as others leave, it is easy to live amongst ghosts of the past. Want to get the past outta my ass.

If you’re new to the Pacific Northwest or planning a trip here, you might already have Mount Rainier, Pike Place Market, or a coffee crawl on your itinerary. But here’s a little local secret: a **Fishing Charter Seattle** experience might just be the highlight you didn’t know you needed. Puget Sound, with its incredible mix of scenery, fish species, and salty adventure, is hands-down one of the most underrated fishing destinations in the entire country.

# Not Just a Body of Water—It’s an Angler's Playground

Puget Sound is a sprawling saltwater estuary that wraps around Seattle and stretches north past Edmonds, WA. It’s not only rich in marine life, but it also offers stunning surroundings: evergreen-draped cliffs, snow-capped mountains, and a skyline that includes both skyscrapers and bald eagles. The best part? You can be on the water reeling in your first catch within an hour of landing at Sea-Tac Airport.

# Home to Legendary Salmon Runs

You’ve heard of Alaska's salmon, sure. But Puget Sound is home to its own legendary runs. Booking a **Salmon Fishing Charter** in Seattle or Edmonds puts you in prime waters for Chinook, Coho, Pink, and Chum salmon throughout the year. If you're lucky enough to visit during an odd-numbered year, the Pink salmon run is downright electric.

# More Than Just Salmon

While salmon get the headlines, Puget Sound also offers rich bottom fishing for lingcod, halibut, and rockfish. There's even the occasional octopus sighting. For anglers who love variety, the Sound delivers in spades. And yes, that 40-pound halibut you heard about? Totally real.

# Underrated = Uncrowded

Unlike more hyped destinations, Puget Sound fishing charters don’t come with long waits, oversold boats, or elbow-to-elbow casting. It’s the sweet spot between wild nature and accessibility. You get that peaceful, authentic fishing vibe while still being close to all the creature comforts of Seattle.

# Great for Newbies and Pros Alike

Whether you’re a seasoned angler or holding a rod for the first time, the captains at Puget Sound Sports Fishing are there to guide you every step of the way. They supply top-tier gear, local knowledge, and pro tips to make your trip easy, fun, and fish-filled.

# A Perfect Add-On to Any Vacation

Let’s be honest—after a few days of city life or hiking, nothing hits quite like a morning on the water. Add a fishing charter to your Seattle vacation, and suddenly your trip has a highlight story you’ll be telling for years. (And maybe even a salmon dinner you caught yourself!)

# Don’t Miss Out

Still on the fence? Trust us—this is one of those ""why didn’t I do this sooner?"" experiences. A **Fishing Charter Seattle** outing is your ticket to discovering why locals love this water and why Puget Sound deserves way more national fishing fame.

Book your trip with [Puget Sound Sports Fishing](https://pugetsoundsportsfishing.com/) and experience the wild side of Washington with seasoned guides and epic scenery. But don’t wait—spots fill up fast, especially during peak salmon runs.

1lgpn6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/1lgpn6v/adhd_and_hsp_my_blueprint_for_life_is_very/,ADHD and HSP. My blueprint for life is very different to others,"When I got diagnosed with ADHD, I finally had an explanation for so many of the ways I was struggling in life. After treating my ADHD, some symptoms were left unanswered:

* Why do I struggle to keep my cool when out and about?
* Why do noises cause intense irritation?
* Why did I drink alcohol at social gatherings? (I don't anymore, which is why I started to notice these feelings of discomfort)
* Why do I never feel calm and comfortable in situations where I should?
* Why do I feel like I'm going to flip out when a sudden change of plans occurs?
* Why do I crave so much time alone?
* Why do I feel so emotionally vulnerable when dealing with people for my job?
* Why does Christmas time with family leave me absolutely exhausted?

I couldn't see these symptoms reflected in my ADHD friends, or even my own family. I wondered whether it could be Autism, but Autism feels like a totally different ball game. 

My therapist told me that I'm a Highly Sensitive Person. I finally have the answer I've been needing for so long. Knowing that I have these psychological conditions, I need to unravel the systems of meaning that I've built myself into.   
  
The real therapy is not forcing a square peg into a triangle hole, it's going to be learning to step back and realise that some people aren't playing with pegs in the first place.

Instead of looking at the crowds of people at the coffee shop and enviously wondering how they can all look so calm and 'in the moment', it's going to be to look around and consider how many people feel just like me, and knew not to go the coffee shop in the first place.

Now more than ever, I can see how different people really are. It helps to avoid comparing yourself to other people you see, because often the happiest and healthiest HSPs won't be in the crowd at all.

In restaurants when you ask for the bill they still make you give them your card. Is everyone really comfortable letting total strangers just walk off with your personal banking information every time you eat out? This practice must be responsible for some credit card fraud, no?
As a server (in Canada) I think that would stress me out. So many things can come up between the table and the server station. I don’t want to be responsible for strangers credit cards! Also that’s so many unnecessary trips back and forth.
Here if you ask for the bill, I bring it over with a portable machine and hand it to you. Easier, quicker, and if it’s declined, much less awkward and public. 

Also, why does venmo exist? It seems unnecessary. Just implement e-transfer. Why would I care if Becky sent Sarah 5 dollars for an iced coffee? 
And I know they’ve now embraced contactless payment (aka Tap in Canada) but why did it take a pandemic before it became super common?

""Then recently I did a genetic test and found out that I have two pretty major amino acid disorders: hypermethionemia and homocystinuria. Basically, raised levels of methionine and cysteine in the blood, that are then expelled through the breath. For those who don't know, both methionine and cysteine have a very distinctive, rotten egg, sulfur type smell. I noticed my breath would get so much worse after drinking milk, eating meat, or consuming high protein legumes. My mouth smelled like boiled cabbage after drinking a coffee with dairy milk.

This first became flagged when I went for a simple urine test at the doctor and they told me that although there was no infection, I was showing unusually large amounts of protein in my urine. There was no follow-up for this and I was never offered further investigation. I decided to be my own advocate and paid for genetic testing.

Now I'm finally doing the right lifestyle as well as being given treatment: avoiding all high protein foods, as well as megadosing b vitamins. I am hoping to try a couple of medications soon and see if that will help even more. My bad breath is 90% gone. It still smells bad if I eat any kind of food with protein which to be honest is kind of hard to avoid. Basically a fruitarian/low protein vegetarian diet is all I can really do, coupled with intermittent fasting.""

This is exactly the kind of disorder I've assumed I've had all these years, I just never had a name for it (other than TMAU being the most similar type of disorder). His symptoms and the source of the symptoms match mine to a T - heavy protein consumption causes worse symptoms.

I will start the process of getting screened for these genetic disorders as soon as I have the time to do it.",1,1750486183.0,TMAU,0,1.0,False

“Little Tian, happy 19th birthday, and happy your one-year work anniversary. How are you dealing with this little ghost you can’t catch?” Kolleen Zhang, Xing Tianwen's colleague, had her face popped up on the screen. Although they were colleagues and had the same rank, they were at least two generations apart.

“Thank you, what can I say? Just so so.”

“You are still young. If I could return to your age, I would definitely never enter this electromagnetic coffin. But my old bones can no longer use the strong interaction force to push open the door sealed by quarks.”

“Professor Zhang, for me, the people outside the coffin are more difficult to deal with than the ghosts in the coffin. Of course, those of us in the coffin are definitely better than the ghosts in the coffin.”

“Well, hope this coffin can give you a surprise birthday gift today.”

Xing Tianwen adjusted the holographic control panel, his fingertips sliding across the suspended quantum data stream. On the main screen of the laboratory, the state of the “Quark Cage” was monitored in real time - the bottom quarks still stubbornly refused to be separated, just like in the past few decades.

“Attempt 3721,” he whispered to himself, “If it fails again, I will…”

“You what?” Kolleen Zhang’s projection flickered on the screen as she remotely accessed the laboratory system. “Quit and become a poet?”

Xing Tianwen curled his lips. “No, let's try attempt number 3722.”

Kolleen Zhang sighed, wrinkles forming at the corners of her eyes. “You know, the paper that won me the Nobel Prize was actually just a 0.3% adjustment of the accelerator's magnetic field parameters.” She shrugged. “Theoretical physics is dead, kid, we're just hosting a long funeral for it.”

“Then I also want to find out how, how did theoretical physics dead,” Xing Tianwen tapped on the keyboard to start a new round of particle beam calibration. “Was it the Trisolarans' sophon blockade? Or was the edifice of theoretical physics really completed 200 years after the Kelvin era?”

“Well, yes, at least you can bury it yourself, and the higher-ups will be willing to pay for the funeral.” Kolleen Zhang said as she sent a news article titled “Farewell, Observatory.” “Astrophysics has long been dead, and now except for a few civilian devices, everything is in the museum.”

Xing Tianwen glanced at the news and sneered. “At least the observatory can be used as a romantic decoration. If our crappy experiment fails, it won't even be qualified as a decoration - who would put a failed Quark Cage in the living room?”

Kolleen Zhang's projection suddenly became serious. “Seriously, Tian. Do you know why there are only a few old fossils, and you, the only crazy young man, left in the institute?” She pulled up a personnel turnover chart, “Anyone with a little ambition has gone to work in applied engineering.”

“Because they want to change the world,” Xing Tianwen said while adjusting the particle beam parameters, “and I just want to understand it.”

“Understanding a world that may not even want to be understood?” Kolleen Zhang shook her head. “You are more stubborn than I thought.”

“Professor Zhang,” Xing Tianwen suddenly stopped what he was doing, “do you think… if theoretical physics has truly reached its end, then we who persist—are we still exploring truth—”

“Or just keeping vigil for science’s deathbed?” Kolleen Zhang finished for him, and the two fell into a brief silence.

The lab AI broke the silence. \[Calibration completed, the 3721st experiment is ready.\]

Xing Tianwen took a deep breath and said, “Let's start and see what will climb out of the coffin today.”

“Magnetic field calibration completed, accelerator begins charging.”

The laboratory's lighting system dimmed automatically, and the particle accelerator emitted a low hum. Xing Tianwen stared at the jumping data stream on the holographic projection, his fingertips unconsciously tapping the edge of the console.

“Charging completed, releasing high-speed particle stream, neutron to proton ratio: 2.569:7.431.”

The core of the accelerator glowed with a ghostly blue light, and the particle beam drew a perfect spiral trajectory in the superconducting magnetic field. Xing Tianwen narrowed his eyes - this time the trajectory seemed to be more stable than usual.

“Collision completed. Collecting and analyzing results…”

“Well, just like me, it doesn't consider birthdays important. "" Xing Tianwen continued to look at the results expressionlessly, took a sip of the coffee beside him , and the bitterness spread on the tip of his tongue. “Attempt 3721, the results are consistent with the previous ones. ""

Kolleen Zhang's projection sighed. “At least it's stable, isn't it?”

“Stable enough to be hopeless.” Xing Tianwen put down his coffee cup and said, “Try again.”

Same procedure, same parameters. But this time…

“Warning: Abnormal energy fluctuations detected.” The AI's voice suddenly grew urgent.

The data stream on the monitoring screen began to flash wildly, and the signals from several peripheral monitors were suddenly interrupted. Xing Tianwen jumped to his feet. “What's going on?”

\[Anomaly: Monitor A-7 signal lost\]

\[Anomaly: Quantum field disturbance exceeds threshold\]

\[Warning: Local space curvature is abnormal\]

“What the…” He rushed towards the observation window, but saw that the space in the core area of the accelerator was distorting - not the type simulated by data, but a real, distortion, visible to the naked eye.

“Lawrence! Stop the experiment immediately! Activate safety protocols!”

\[Unable to execute: Control system not responding\]

\[Suggestion: Keep your distance, analyzing the anomaly...\]

“It seems that I have to catch ghosts myself today.” Xing Tianwen grabbed the portable detector and rushed to the isolation gate. The access control system flashed a red light: \[Danger area, no entry\]

“You are dead and still say ‘no entry’?” He directly took out the engineer’s override key, bypass the security protocol, then got on the special electric bike inside the laboratory and rushed to the abnormal area.

“Little Tian… come back…” Kolleen Zhang’s voice was severely interrupted, and the holographic projection flickered and distorted.

“Run away, professor! If anything happens to this lab…”

Before Xing Tianwen finished speaking, the electric bike abruptly slowed down, as if it had hit an invisible wall. He looked up sharply and saw that the distortion in the core area of the accelerator was even more intense, and the lights in the lab were refracted into strange rainbow colors.

A cold wind blew in my face, bringing with it the sharp smell of pine wood and frozen earth.

“The liquid helium exploded?!” Cold sweat ran down Xing Tianwen’s back, but then realized something was wrong. The thermal system in the lab would not produce this kind of natural smell. “This is an artificial island in the sea, where does the smell of pine and soil come from?!”

He jumped off the electric bike, and the values on the detector jumped wildly:

\[Ambient temperature: -12℃\]

\[Abnormal atmosphere composition: Unknown organic molecules detected\]

Even stranger, snowflakes began to fall from the air—real, glittering hexagonal ice crystals that landed on his white coat but did not melt immediately.

“This is impossible…” Xing Tianwen stretched out his hand to catch a snowflake, and felt the real cool touch on his fingertips.

Just then…

“Boom!”

A muffled sound came from the core of the accelerator, and the colorful vortex suddenly expanded, and the violent gravity began to tear everything around it. The metal bracket twisted and broke, and the equipment was sucked into the vortex and disappeared without a trace.

Xing Tianwen held on to a fixed support, but the suction force was getting stronger and stronger. His feet were already off the ground, and he was being pulled towards the unknown abyss.

At the last moment, he looked towards the control room and tried to struggle to crawl there, but it was in vain .

Then, the world fell into absolute darkness and silence.

An unknown amount of time has passed in the immeasurable space and time…

Xing Tianwen was still unconscious, but his mind began to automatically recall his experiences over the past 19 years. At the same time, this memory seemed to have been enhanced by someone: a gentle female voice was singing something. Although his body remained numb, he always felt that the female voice was slightly chilly.

He was one of the embryos used in the first human hibernation experiment in 204Y. He learned about this only after he went to college at the age of 12. In 208Z, the year he was officially born, he was sent to an orphanage. But for some still unknown reasons, he always refused to play with other children in the orphanage, and stayed alone. The director stuffed him into the library and isolated him from other children.

Unexpectedly, Xing Tianwen showed a strong learning ability. Since he learned to read at the age of 3, he buried himself in the library, absorbing all the materials from elementary school to high school courses . Moreover, he has a strong concentration. While other children felt uncomfortable sitting for half an hour, he could sit for four or five hours in a row. This made him even more unsociable, and hide himself deeper in the library.

At 12, he was admitted to Genius Academy, established by UNESCO, and he was the youngest among all students. In that university for geniuses, Xing Tianwen completed his high-energy physics major in two years, and his graduation project made the school directly gave him a PhD—the only one exception in the history of Genius Academy.

That is to say, at the age of 14, Xing Tianwen could start working in the research institute. However, at that time, countries around the world stipulated that the minimum working age is 18. To ensure that Xing Tianwen would not have nowhere to go, the headmaster funded Xing Tianwen’s global travel. Whether it was tourism or exchange program with other schools, all expenses were covered by the headmaster. “You are very smart, but you are still a child who needs to see the world. No school can teach you that.” The principal said this when comforting Xing Tianwen. In these four years, Xing Tianwen flied all over the world. No matter where he went, the headmaster and his staff would take care of him.

At 18, he joined Quark 7 Institute. This news caused quite a stir. Some people believed that he might be able to revive theoretical physics, while others felt that when theoretical physics was dying, even the most talented genius would only be in vain.

The final scene freezes on a photo: Xing Tianwen was traveling in a traditional Asian garden , squatting under a jasmine tree, trying to rescue an injured sparrow.

Xing Tianwen also woke up at this time, followed by a biting cold wind.

“Why am I not dead…”

He subconsciously held his breath and found himself lying on his back in the thick snow. The sky was an unfamiliar blue-purple hue, the blizzard had stopped, and the surroundings were terribly silent.",1,1750485854.0,Frozen,1,1.0,False
1lgpihk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lgpihk/im_just_so_confused_and_depressed/,I'm just so confused and depressed.,"I (20M) am still fresh off of a breakup with my (now ex) girlfriend (19F) of 2.5 years. She was and still is my whole world. She broke up with me 2 weeks ago after I had an emotional outburst where I said something impulsive and potentially hurtful through text then followed it up with a bad apology (later corrected with a better one). This wasn't an isolated event, and it's actually an issue I've had for as long as I remember. I'm very ashamed of it every time it occurs, and while I've worked to fix it, I haven't managed to erase the problem.

About 3 months prior to my shitty text, she had come to me telling me that she wanted to see me take better care of myself, or she couldn't see a very good future with me. I told her that I would work on myself as much as I could to make her feel comfortable in our future, but she insisted that we take a break from seeing each other during that time. I disagreed, telling her that I believed having her around would be more motivating for me, but she thought that I had to do it ""on my own"", otherwise I may not being doing it for the right reasons. Long story short, she softened up her viewpoint a bit, but she was still incredibly distant, never making plans with me, sending me home quickly the times we did see each other, and never letting me cuddle her in bed at night. I was hurting, but I thought if I stayed the course everything would work out. 

Now we come to my outburst once more. It was the first I'd had in probably half a year, during which I had put my full effort into being the best boyfriend for her I could be while receiving very little in return physically or emotionally. I regret my anger that day, but pert of me feels it was inevitable with the environment she cultivated, but maybe that environment only existed because of my previous failures. Who's to say. Anyway, what I'm getting at is that I feel like she dumped me after I made one mistake after a long period of me putting everything I had into keeping us together. I feel betrayed, like she didn't care about anything I did, like she didn't even try to be happy with me and instead distracted herself with other people and activities. However, I also know her intimately, and I know she cares about me, that she recognized she wasn't the greatest to me these last few months, and she's also said that she just didn't know how to be happy in our relationship anymore, and I believe her.

Since the breakup, we haven't fought, although I've expressed my intense grief to her, and she's tried to encourage me to find support in my friends (really only 1 friend). But she's also said that her heart still belongs to me, and that she still loves me, just not in the same way. And when, admittedly out of desperation, I asked her if we could try starting over, she didn't give me a ""no"" but more of a ""not right now/maybe later"". We're trying to remain close friends, but I'm still in so much pain, and the way she's acting towards me is just spinning my brain in circles. She's responded to my texts more frequently in the last few weeks than in the 5 months before that, and she even scheduled plans to get coffee with me later this week.

I guess I just needed to vent, but I also maybe wanted advice? I still love her, she's still my best friend, but it's so hard to see her and not be able to reach for what hangs between us. I believe she's made a mistake and that we can be happy together again, but I also know I can't pressure her, and I can't act like a creep. I want to ask her to hang out with me more, and eventually ask her on a date again, but I'm scared that she's just moving on and won't even think to look in my direction again. Am I a fool? Should I just quit while I'm behind? Will I hurt myself more if I keep trying? I apologize for the length of this post, and for it's lack of any real focus. This is my first time here and my first breakup in general, so I'm an unbelievable mess. Thank you to anyone who read this, and I hope some of you may be able to impart your knowledge unto me.",1,1750485780.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

Unemployed ako, but I'm free to dream. Also I know I need to get a job first of course since figures are everything apparently. But I would genuinely appreciate tips and advice. This is just for me to be mindful of as I figure out my saving journey.

Problem/Goal:
 I'm unemployed but I want to learn to save/budget money. I want to learn how to properly divide up my future salary 🤞 and just be more responsible with my life.

Context: 
I'm an AB English fresh grad that has no luck with employment so far. I graduated last year pa. Due to personal reasons, I didn't actively start looking for a job and I started seriously looking around this year pa. After months of the constant rejection I decided to take a break and not pressure myself as much. Palagi nalang pressure dito, duon, at ngayon? Pressure cooker na ang Pinas. So I'm taking a little break. I've even considered starting a little business in hopes to at least start somewhere, y'know? 

The only savings I know is literally the old fashioned way. Yung piggy bank. Yes, it sounds silly, pero naka bili ako ng phone tsaka netbook nuon when I was a student. I still have a piggy bank now. But I also wanna go digital din. 

So far based on what I've learned and researched, eto yung na figure out ko so far:

I wanna somehow divide and utilize the bucket savings option to all of these apps. So far I have Gcash and GoTyme. Plan ko mag install sa Maya at Tonik din.

So my fixed expenses would be: Rent, Utilities (electricity, water), Internet + Mobile Plan, Insurance (Health, Life), and Subscriptions (Spotify). I wanna move out of the house in the future hence the rent option.

Variable Expenses: Groceries, Transportation, Dining out & Coffee, Shopping, Self Care.

Savings: Emergency Fund, Retirement Fund, Stocks & Mutual Fund

Sinking Funds: Travel Fund, Gift Fund, Gadget Fund

And then, if ever there's an excess... I'll just enjoy my excess.🤷 Life is too short anyways. I just wanna be more responsible with money somehow. These are just what I've gathered. I'm willing to learn. If you have any suggestions please also let me know. Please be kind as well, absolute beginner ako dito. Malay mo maka tulong din tong post sa ibang tao. 

How did you start saving when you had very little? Anyone here use Gcash or GoTyme? How do you set up your budgets? Thank you!

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis & Data-Driven Bet: Paris Saint-Germain vs. Seattle Sounders FC**  
*The FIFA Club World Cup’s Group B showdown is a tale of desperation vs. detachment. Paris Saint-Germain, led by the newly anointed ""Mastermind"" Luis Enrique, needs a win to avoid a historic humiliation. The Seattle Sounders, meanwhile, are the sports equivalent of a half-empty coffee cup—already eliminated, but here for the vibes. Let’s break it down with stats, sarcasm, and some math.*

---

### Key Context & Stats

* **PSG’s Stakes**: Win or go home. Their group record: 1-1-0 (1 win vs. Atletico Madrid, 1 loss to Botafogo).
* **Sounders’ Stakes**: Eliminated after consecutive losses to Atletico (3-1) and Botafogo (1-0). Their MLS form? 6th in the Western Conference—good for a playoff push, bad for Club World Cup credibility.
* **Head-to-Head**: No prior meetings. But PSG’s attacking trio (Neymar, Mbappé, etc.) vs. Seattle’s MLS defense? It’s like pitting a flamethrower against a soggy paper towel.

---

### Injuries & Player Updates

* **PSG**: No major injuries reported. Luis Enrique’s ""master plan"" includes Kylian Mbappé (assuming he’s not on strike for a new contract… again).
* **Sounders**: Goalkeeper Stefan Frei is questionable (hamstring), and star striker Raul Ruidíaz is nursing a minor knee issue. Injuries? More like ""plot armor"" for a team already out of contention.

---

### Odds & Expected Value (EV) Breakdown

**Bookmaker Odds (June 21, 2025):**

* **PSG Win**: 1.16 (86.2% implied)
* **Sounders Win**: 15.0 (6.7% implied)
* **Draw**: 7.25 (13.8% implied)

**Underdog Win Rate Adjustment**:  
Soccer underdogs win 41% of the time. The Sounders’ implied win rate (6.7%) is *wildly* below this. Splitting the difference:

* **Adjusted Sounders Win Probability**: (6.7% + 41%) / 2 = **23.85%**

**EV Calculation for Sounders (+1400 odds):**  
EV = (23.85% \* 15) - (76.15% \* 1) = **3.5775 - 0.7615 = +2.816**  
*Positive EV? That’s not a typo. The Sounders are a 23.85% shot to pull off an upset, which would pay 15x your stake. Even if they lose, you’re still down only 76.15% of the time. Math checks out.*

---

### Why Bet the Sounders?

1. **Historical Underdog Magic**: Soccer’s 41% underdog win rate vs. 6.7% implied odds = a golden arbitrage opportunity.
2. **PSG’s Pressure**: Needing a win to advance, PSG might overcommit. Sounders, with nothing to lose, could exploit counterattacks or defensive lapses.
3. **Venue Edge?**: Lumen Field in Seattle is a ""cage"" for visiting teams. Cold weather, rowdy fans, and a 9,000-seat capacity (vs. PSG’s 50,000+ Parc des Princes) could disrupt their rhythm.

---

### Alternative Bets

* **Spread**: PSG -2.25 (-110) is a trap. Even if they win, covering a 2.25-goal line against a team that’s already lost twice? Unlikely.
* **Total**: Over 3.25 (-105) is tempting if you think PSG’s offense will dominate. But Seattle’s defense, while leaky, might hold firm in a ""nothing-to-lose"" scenario.

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet**: **Seattle Sounders ML (+1400)**

* **Why**: The EV is +281.6% (per $100 bet), and the adjusted win probability (23.85%) is far higher than the bookies’ 6.7%.
* **Rationale**: Soccer underdogs thrive in high-stakes chaos. PSG’s pressure, Seattle’s ""freedom to lose,"" and the 41% underdog rate make this a statistical anomaly worth chasing.

**Expected Value Play**: Bet $100 on the Sounders. If they win (23.85% chance), you’ll net $1,400. If they lose (76.15% chance), you’ll lose $100. Over 100 identical bets, you’d expect a **$281.60 profit**.

**Most Likely Outcome**: PSG wins comfortably (86.2% implied). But *most likely* ≠ *best value*. Go for the EV, not the safe pick.

*Final Score Prediction*: **PSG 2, Sounders 1** (but don’t tell the bookies we said so). 🏆🔥

It’s the graveyard shift.
Lights hum low.
Parking lot quiet.
Radio slow.

Then here he comes—fast walk, high strung,
Like he’s mid-episode and I missed scene one.
Vest too tight, breath too loud,
Looking around like he’s tracking a crowd.

“Something’s off,” he mutters, all edge, no fact,
Hugging his radio like it might talk back.
Keeps circling benches, eyeing the trees,
Like calm is suspicious and silence deceives.

I stay by the entrance, keepin’ things clean,
Watching him spiral through a peaceful scene.
No alarms, no noise, not even a sound—
But he’s looking for trouble where ain’t none to be found.

He radios in like it’s Code Red time,
Says he saw shadows move “in a threatening line.”
But it’s just two teens in the park by the swings,
Laughing at memes and tossing their rings.

A woman strolls by with her coffee in hand,
He clocks her like she’s leading a band.
“Too casual,” he notes, “could be a scout.”
I blink twice slow—what’s this guy about?

He starts making rounds like the place might blow,
Tugging on doors we already know.
Reports a disturbance—there’s nothing around.
Still looking for trouble where ain’t none to be found.

I get it. Graveyard’s slow, and the mind can drift.
But paranoia’s not part of the shift.
My job’s to be ready, calm and precise—
Not chase down ghosts ‘cause quiet feels dicey.

So I log his report, check the cams once more,
Watch the wind push leaves across the floor.
Another long night, another spun tale—
Another hero chasing shadows on the trail.

And me? I stay posted, boots on the ground,
Guardin’ the peace he can’t seem to be around.
While he walks in circles, too tightly wound,
Still looking for trouble where ain’t none to be found.",2,1750485089.0,Poems,1,1.0,False

#### The Myth vs. Reality of Nomadic Life

Forget the Instagram filter. The nomadic lifestyle isn’t all hammocks and sunsets. It’s a paradox—freedom and uncertainty, adventure and admin, exhilaration and exhaustion. The myth? Endless vacation. The reality? A relentless dance with chaos, punctuated by moments of raw, unfiltered awe.

#### Why People Choose the Nomadic Path

Why abandon the comfort of roots for the uncertainty of wings? For some, it’s escape from the nine-to-five grind. For others, a quest for meaning, autonomy, or just a damn good story. The nomad’s path is paved with ambition, rebellion, and a refusal to settle for the ordinary.

**Curious about your own nomadic potential?**  
***🌍 Unleash Your Digital Nomad Income Potential—Get your custom diagnosis in 90 seconds! [Start here.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

#### Waking Up in Unfamiliar Places

Every sunrise is a roulette spin. Today, it’s a hostel bunk in Medellín. Tomorrow, a bamboo hut in Bali. The only constant? Change. Your alarm clock is the chatter of new languages, the scent of unfamiliar streets.

#### The Sacred Hunt for Wi-Fi and Coffee

First mission: caffeine and connectivity. You become a bloodhound, sniffing out strong Wi-Fi and decent espresso. These are the twin pillars of survival. No signal? No paycheck. Bad coffee? No soul.

**Want to know if your skills pay the bills on the road?**  
***💡 Discover Your Digital Nomad Income Score in 90 seconds! [Check your potential now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

#### Coworking Spaces, Cafés, and Park Benches

Your office? Fluid. One day, a sunlit coworking space buzzing with ambition. The next, a rickety table in a crowded café, headphones your only fortress. Sometimes, a park bench becomes your boardroom. Adapt or perish.

#### The Art of Hacking Productivity on the Move

Productivity isn’t a routine—it’s a survival skill. You learn to carve out focus amid chaos: noise-canceling headphones, Pomodoro timers, caffeine-fueled sprints. Distraction is the enemy. Discipline is your secret weapon.

#### Remote Work: Gigs, Clients, and Deadlines

You’re a juggler. Projects, clients, side hustles—each ball in the air, none allowed to drop. Deadlines don’t care about your time zone. The hustle is global, relentless, and unforgiving.

#### Juggling Time Zones and Global Teams

Your calendar is a patchwork of time zones. Morning calls with Berlin, midnight deadlines for New York. Sleep is a negotiable currency. Flexibility isn’t a perk—it’s a prerequisite.

#### Eating on the Go: Street Food, Markets, and Meal Hacks

Food is adventure. Breakfast might be bánh mì from a street cart, lunch a mystery stew at a local market. You become a connoisseur of cheap eats and culinary improvisation. Your kitchen? A backpack and a spork.

#### Navigating Dietary Chaos

Gluten-free in Georgia? Vegan in Vietnam? Good luck. Dietary preferences become survival puzzles. You adapt, compromise, or sometimes just surrender to the local delicacy, consequences be damned.

#### Packing and Unpacking: The Minimalist’s Dance

Your life distilled to 40 liters. Every item earns its place. Packing is ritual, unpacking a fleeting luxury. Minimalism isn’t a trend—it’s enforced by airline baggage fees and spinal health.

#### Transportation Roulette: Planes, Trains, Tuk-Tuks

Movement is the only constant. Today, a budget airline. Tomorrow, a rickety bus or a tuk-tuk weaving through chaos. Delays, detours, and the occasional missed connection are rites of passage.

**Wondering if your hustle is nomad-ready?**

#### Making Friends in 24 Hours or Less

Loneliness is a shadow. So you learn the art of fast friendship: a smile, a shared meal, a spontaneous adventure. The global tribe is real, bonded by wanderlust and Wi-Fi.

#### The Secret Handshake of the Global Tribe

There’s a look, a knowing nod. You spot each other in airports, hostels, coworking spaces. The handshake? Shared stories, travel hacks, and the unspoken promise to cross paths again.

#### Solitude in the Crowd

You can be surrounded and still alone. The crowd is transient, connections fleeting. Solitude becomes both a curse and a sanctuary. You learn to savor your own company.

#### Coping Strategies: Digital Communities and Analog Escapes

When loneliness bites, you reach for digital lifelines—video calls, group chats, online forums. Sometimes, you unplug and seek solace in nature, a book, or a long, aimless walk.

**Think you’ve got what it takes to live untethered?**

#### Micro-Adventures Between Zoom Calls

The world is your playground. Between meetings, you chase waterfalls, climb volcanoes, or get gloriously lost in new cities. Adventure isn’t a weekend activity—it’s a daily vitamin.

#### The Adrenaline Economy

You trade routine for adrenaline. Each new place offers a fresh hit: paragliding at dawn, street food at midnight. The mundane is banished, replaced by perpetual novelty.

#### Boundaries: Myth or Necessity?

Work-life balance? A mirage. Your office is your bedroom, your lunch break a city tour. Boundaries blur, then disappear. You learn to set hard stops—or risk burning out.

#### Burnout and the Art of the Pause

Burnout stalks the ambitious. The antidote? Rituals of rest: meditation, digital detox, or just a lazy afternoon hammock session. You learn to pause, recharge, and protect your spark.

#### Budgeting with Currency Roulette

Your wallet is a chameleon. One day, you’re a king; the next, a pauper. Currency exchange rates, ATM fees, and surprise expenses keep you on your toes. Budgeting is both science and black magic.

#### Income Streams: Passive, Active, and Everything in Between

You diversify or die. Freelance gigs, online courses, affiliate links—every dollar matters. The holy grail? Passive income, but the hustle never really stops.

#### Fitness Hacks for the Perpetually Uprooted

Gyms are rare. So you improvise: resistance bands, bodyweight circuits, running in strange cities. Fitness is a moving target, but you chase it anyway.

#### Mental Health: The Invisible Luggage

Anxiety, stress, and homesickness travel with you. You learn to unpack them—sometimes with meditation, sometimes with therapy, sometimes with a stiff drink and a call home.

#### Visas, Taxes, and the Bureaucratic Circus

Paperwork is your nemesis. Visas expire, tax laws shift, rules change mid-flight. You become part detective, part escape artist, always one step ahead of the bureaucratic beast.

#### Staying Legal in a World with Borders

Every country has its own maze. Overstayed visa? Hefty fine. Wrong tax form? Nightmare. You master the paperwork, or it masters you.

#### Language Hacks and Cultural Immersion

You collect phrases like souvenirs. “Hello,” “Thank you,” “Where’s the Wi-Fi?” Language is a bridge, sometimes a barrier. Cultural immersion is the real curriculum.

#### The School of Perpetual Adaptation

Every day is a pop quiz. New customs, new rules, new surprises. Adaptation isn’t just a skill—it’s your passport to survival.

#### Essential Gear and Digital Survival Kits

Your gear is sacred. Laptop, power bank, universal adapter, VPN. Lose one, and chaos reigns. Your backpack is a mobile command center.

#### Security: Cyber and Physical

You guard your data like a dragon hoards gold. Two-factor everything. Backups on backups. Physically, you stay alert—scams, pickpockets, the occasional sketchy hostel.

**Is your skillset ready for the digital wilds?**  
***🛡️ Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential—90 seconds to clarity! [Try it now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

#### The Eco-Footprint of Constant Movement

Travel leaves a mark. Flights, plastic, over-tourism. You wrestle with the guilt, seek ways to tread lighter—slow travel, local economies, less waste.

#### Conscious Travel Choices

You vote with your wallet. Eco-lodges, public transport, ethical tours. Every choice is a statement, every dollar a vote for the world you want.

#### Love, Friendship, and the Nomad’s Heartache

Relationships are intense, fleeting, sometimes doomed by distance. You love hard, say goodbye often, and learn to cherish the impermanent.

#### Keeping Connections Alive Across Continents

WhatsApp, Zoom, postcards. You nurture old ties, build new ones, and become a master of long-distance everything.

#### Resilience, Adaptability, and Radical Self-Reliance

You become unbreakable. Every setback is a lesson, every challenge a badge. Adaptability is your armor, resilience your compass.

#### Embracing Uncertainty as a Superpower

Certainty is for the sedentary. You thrive in the unknown, find comfort in unpredictability. Uncertainty isn’t a threat—it’s your playground.

#### Night Rituals and Reflections

The day ends with rituals: journaling, stargazing, a call home. You reflect, recalibrate, and prepare for tomorrow’s unknowns.

#### Sleep: The Elusive Luxury

Sleep is currency. Sometimes you’re rich, sometimes bankrupt. You learn to snatch rest wherever you can, because tomorrow starts early.

#### The Real Cost and Reward of the Nomadic Lifestyle

The nomadic life extracts a price—comfort, stability, predictability. But the rewards? Freedom, growth, stories worth telling. Is the juice worth the squeeze? Only you can answer.

#### Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze?

For some, absolutely. For others, never. The nomadic lifestyle isn’t a trend—it’s a calling. If you hear it, answer boldly. The world is waiting.",1,1750484849.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

1lgp6e0,https://i.redd.it/rbrkw9a9x78f1.jpeg,Vancouver WA New Waterfront is an Amazing Place to Visit.,"Located on a scenic seven-mile stretch along the Columbia River, the Vancouver Waterfront has rapidly transformed into a lively destination for locals and visitors alike. Anchored by the striking Grant Street Pier, the centerpiece of Waterfront Park, the area offers sweeping river views and connects downtown to the historic Fort Vancouver via the Vancouver Land Bridge .

Dining & Drinks by the River

WildFin American Grill sits right on the water’s edge, perfect for seafood lovers enjoying a fresh-caught meal on its patio while watching sailboats drift by.

Nearby, Twigs Bistro & Martini Bar serves craft cocktails and upscale comfort food, ideal for an evening out.

The Waterfront Taphouse and Ruse Brewing Co.’s Crust Collective offer relaxed settings with local beer flights and pub fare—ideal for laid-back afternoons.

Wine enthusiasts can hop between several tasting rooms—Maryhill, Amavi, Brian Carter, Airfield Estates, Valo, Barnard Griffin, Willamette Valley Vineyards, and Evoke—lined up near the promenade  .

Coffee & Light Bites

Savona Coffee House, tucked along the waterfront, is known for its cozy ambiance and great coffee—though prices reflect the premium vibe.

A short stroll inland brings you to Kafiex Roasters Coffee Lab, a local favorite serving Fair Trade brews and Mexican sweet breads under a vibrant mural.

Downtown venues like Compass Coffee, Baron Patisserie, Bleu Door Bakery, and Latte Da Coffeehouse offer artisanal pastries, quiches, and espresso drinks in charming, laptop‑friendly spaces.

Waterfront Park & Activities

The 7.3‑acre Waterfront Park features an urban beach for sandcastles, lawns for picnics and cartwheels, and the interactive “Headwaters Wall,” a bronze topographic flow of the Columbia River – perfect for playful dips.

The Waterfront Renaissance Trail extends five miles and connects to the Land Bridge, Fort Vancouver, and Riverside parks—great for walking, cycling, or scootering.

Families appreciate the water‑play features and public art installations scattered throughout the park—providing both fun and educational moments.

Stay & Explore

Stay right on the waterfront at the AC Hotel by Marriott or Hotel Indigo, both offering river‑view rooms and on‑site dining.

Just steps away, you'll find El Gaucho’s steakhouse, 13 Coins, and Evoke Wine Bar, all within or near Hotel Indigo.

From sunlit mornings with a cup of Kafiex coffee to sunset dinners at WildFin, the Vancouver Waterfront is a destination that blends riverside tranquility with urban vibrancy. Whether you're picnicking in Waterfront Park, pedaling the trail, or hopping between tasting rooms, you'll discover a rich mix of flavor, outdoor recreation, and cultural connection.

1lgp62v,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceBharat/comments/1lgp62v/5_good_financial_habits/,5 good financial habits,"Building strong money habits early can set you on the path to financial freedom—and there’s no better time than now. Here are five practical financial habits tailor-made for Indians, with concrete steps you can start implementing today.

1. Automate Your Savings

Why it works: Out of sight, out of mind—when you automate, you never miss a deposit, and you won’t be tempted to spend what you planned to save.

How to start:
	•Set up a standing instruction from your salary account to transfer a fixed amount (e.g., 10–20% of your take-home) into a separate savings or sweep-in account on pay-day.
	•Use “round-ups” on UPI apps: Some wallets let you round every UPI payment up to the next ₹10/₹100 and sweep the spare change into an investment or savings pot.


2. Track Every Rupee Spent

Why it works: You can’t control what u don’t measure. Even small leakages (for example like daily coffee, OTT subscriptions you no longer watch) add up over a month.

How to start:
	1.	Pick one simple tool—a notebook, an expense-tracking Google Sheet, or an app like Walnut, Money View, or Google Pay’s “Spends” feature.
	2.	Log expenses daily: Commit to updating it each evening (takes 2–3 minutes).
	3.	Review weekly: Identify one category (e.g., dining out) where you overshot and set a small reduction target for next week.


3. Build an Emergency Fund First

Why it works: A rainy-day corpus (3–6 months’ worth of essential expenses) protects you from having to liquidate investments or take on high-interest debt when life throws a curveball.

How to start:
	•Calculate your monthly burn rate: Rent + groceries + utilities + loan EMIs + petrol/transport. Multiply by 3 (or ideally by 6).
	•Keep it ultra-liquid: Park this fund in a high-interest savings account, a sweep-in account, or a liquid mutual fund—anywhere you can access it within 24 hours.
	•Top it up gradually: If ₹1.8 lakh feels intimidating, start with a goal of ₹50,000 over three months (₹16,700/month).


4. Invest via SIPs in Mutual Funds

Why it works: Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) enforce discipline, leverage rupee cost averaging, and help you benefit from compounding over the long run.

How to start:
	1.Choose 2–3 diversified equity funds (e.g., a large-cap fund + a flexi-cap or multi-cap fund + an ELSS for tax saving).
	2.Decide on your risk-capacity: Younger investors (25–35 years) can start with 80% equity, 20% debt; adjust as you near retirement or big expenses.
	3. Set up SIPs of even a modest amount (₹1,000–₹2,000/month) through your bank’s net-banking or an aggregator app like Groww/Paytm Money.


5. Review & Rebalance Quarterly

Why it works: Life goals change—marriage, home purchase, child’s education—so should your financial plan. Plus, asset-class performance drifts with markets.

How to start:
	•Quarterly calendar reminder (e.g., last weekend of each quarter).
	•Check your portfolio mix: Equity vs. debt vs. gold vs. cash. If equity has run up to 90% of your portfolio (from 80%), sell a bit of equity and move to debt or gold to get back to target.
	•Revisit your goals: Did you increase your home-loan EMI? Planning a foreign trip? Adjust your SIPs and savings buffer accordingly.

Note: Consult a financial advisor before making any financial decision or investment as the investments are subject to market risks. ",1,1750484506.0,personalfinanceBharat,0,1.0,False

I find I pair best with people who are any (or multiple) of the following:

- alternative (elder emo here, but not a dealbeaker. people who aren't afraid to be a little different.)

- passionate (about SOMETHING. ANYTHING. share your hobbies. I wouldn't know a thing about it but i still wanna learn.)

- musical (as a listener or creator. i love finding new music outside of my norm and sharing)

- nerdy (i'm in to a little bit of everything myself but i guess gaming is my big thing. Casuals or ""bad"" gamers welcome too.)

- philosophical thinkers (or overthinkers. if you think about what stuff actually means, welcome to the club)

- silly (long debates over things that requires looney toons logic but taken as seriously as a life or death scenario)

- honest (not just with others but with yourself. it's a really important quality to be who you are and not pretend to be someone else)

Few tidbits about me:

- Between graveyard shifts, i have vacation plans for the summer. I have a checklist of daytrips including a beach, a lighthouse, some kind of nice dinner and a rage room.

- Yeah, i play games but my most played game recently? Chess. I'm even reading books and watching videos about it. I think it's a sign im getting old....

- Hopefully moving soon so i've been in and out of IKEA lately and planning out a new place for myself. I'm very excited for it. 

- I heard a song a couple weeks ago and a lyric that's been sticking with me is ""The grass aint greener on the other side, it's greener where you water"". Kinda has been ringing true for me lately. thoughts?

- Speaking of music, a friend described my taste of music isn't a genre or vibe but how ""novel"" it is. I don't think they're wrong but i still feel kinda called out about it.

It will have a coffee cart, non-alcoholic elixir bar, a tea lounge, meal program for artists, and education programs. We’re a decentrally governed co-op style community with so much to share. The administration is all volunteer at this point. We feel we are on the front edge of Portland revitalization efforts.

We’re in the final 10 days of our ambitious Kickstarter to fund the last phase of the build. 
Any small donation or help sharing it with people who might feel inspired could make all the difference. I have attached the link to our Kickstarter and our website in the event anyone feels inspired to get involved.

1lgp3nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1lgp3nz/the_power_of_daily_habits_are_you_building_or/,The Power of Daily Habits: Are You Building or Breaking?,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! Let’s talk about something we all deal with every single day: HABITS. Whether you realize it or not, your daily habits are silently shaping your life—either building you up or breaking you down. So, are you consciously choosing habits that maximize your potential, or are you just drifting?

**Why Daily Habits Matter So Much**

Habits are like the autopilot of your brain. Once they stick, they consume less mental energy and dictate your daily outcomes. Good habits lead to productivity, improved health, and mental clarity. Bad habits? Well, those can drag you into stress, procrastination, and self-doubt. The kicker is: small, seemingly insignificant habits add up BIG TIME over weeks, months, and years.

**Building Versus Breaking: The Habit Scale**

The real question is: Are you *building* habits that propel you forward or *breaking* down your progress by slipping into destructive routines? It’s not just about “being good” or “bad.” It’s about tweaking your environment and mindset to make **building habits easier and breaking bad ones more manageable**.

Here’s how you can start:

1. **Identify Your Keystone Habits:** These are habits that cause a ripple effect in your life. For example, exercising regularly often leads to eating better and sleeping well.
   
2. **Stack Your Habits:** Use “habit stacking” — attach a new habit to an existing one. If you make coffee every morning, try journaling or stretching right after.

3. **Track Your Progress:** Seeing small wins can motivate you to keep going. Apps, journals, or simple checklists work wonders.

4. **Replace, Don’t Just Remove:** Instead of just quitting something (like scrolling social media), replace it with something positive (reading, learning).

**Struggling to Stay Consistent?**

Consistency is the golden ticket but toughest to master. That’s why comprehensive, well-structured programs help immensely. For those who want a proven system, check out this 12-month habit-building plan that’s been getting buzz among Redditors looking to up their game: [The All-Day 12-Month Plan](https://whop.com/all-day-12-month-plan/?a=liveitupdeals)

It breaks down habit formation into manageable chunks with daily actionable steps to help you build momentum throughout the year — not just for days or weeks but long-term change.

**Bonus Tips to Maximize Your Habit Success:**

- **Environment Design:** Make your environment work for you. Want to read more? Keep books handy, put devices away.
- **Accountability Buddies:** Share your goals with friends or this very community. We can help keep each other in check.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Didn’t miss a workout this week? Bought that healthy lunch every day? Treat yourself a bit—it reinforces positive behavior.

---

At the end of the day, habits determine the trajectory of your life more than raw talent or motivation. By curating the right habits and consciously working on them daily, you truly maximize yourself.

That being said… any tips or advice to help this go smoothly? I am so awkward and fear I won’t be able to keep a conversation flowing naturally or that we will end up with awkward silences and such.

I'm looking for an old animated video that seems to have been deleted from YouTube. The title was something like:

**“coffee = ??? Sonic funny Animation”**  
It was uploaded by a channel called **DONUT Edition** (sometimes written as *Donut Edition 🍩*).

It was a short, funny animation involving Sonic the Hedgehog and some kind of coffee joke or gag. The animation had a light-hearted tone, and may have included characters like Tails or Cream. Unfortunately, the video appears to be gone now, and the channel is no longer active.

I've tried searching on YouTube, [Archive.org](http://Archive.org), and other sites, but haven’t had any luck so far. If anyone has a saved copy, knows of a reupload, or remembers any specific scenes or dialogue, I’d really appreciate your help!

1lgp176,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tahiti/comments/1lgp176/bora_bora_trip/,Bora Bora trip,"Hi all. These kinds of posts were helpful to me when my husband and I were planning our honeymoon so thought I would share as we recently returned from our stay. It was everything we expected and more, it truly is a once in a lifetime type trip and is perfect for honeymoons. We did 6 nights at the Westin and 5 nights at the St. Regis. Here are our thoughts. Let me know if you have any questions! 

Westin
- This was my favorite. It was beautiful with a great view of the mountain and everything was so nice and new. The finishes and furnishings are clean and modern (light woods and lots of blues) and we had zero complaints. The resort as a whole is a great size IMO - big enough that things are spread out and people aren’t always around but small enough that it’s not a pain to get to places (plus the bikes are great) and you can take advantage of the entire place during your stay.
- This may have just been during our stay and because it’s newer (I’m sure it won’t always be this way) but we were shocked at  the number of people here - it was way less busy than the St. Regis and there were hardly any children. It was so quiet and peaceful.
- The bungalow was great (much smaller than the St. Regis, but I preferred the cozier feel, plus we didn’t spend a ton of time there). We had everything we needed! 
- The service was fantastic and every single person we met was incredibly kind. We couldn’t get over how friendly and nice everyone was. 
- The food was great - we did room service a couple nights just to be lazy and it was quick and the food was great. The restaurants were incredible - my husband and I love food and nice restaurants but aren’t really picky or snobby so we thought everything was awesome. We loved that they were all either on the water or beach. 
- The spa was truly heavenly and I had the best massage of my life there. The gym was super nice too and most of the time I was completely alone in there.
- One of the best parts of the resort is the ecocenter. My husband and I love love love all animals and getting to see the sea turtles and several octopi and so many different fish up close became part of our daily routine. We loved that the Westin seems to place a real emphasis on conservation and the environment and little touches like no plastic water bottles were much appreciated.

St. Regis
- This was my husbands favorite. It was truly a five star resort. The service, landscaping, and general environment are incredibly luxurious. The resort is huge and well laid out. However, between relaxing and our activities off the resort, I don’t think we had time to utilize everything and fully enjoy and explore the entire resort like we did at the Westin (not a complaint but just noting). Again, everyone here was so nice and helpful and happy to greet us and talk with us. WiFi was pretty subpar across the whole resort.
- The Lagoonarium was so freaking cool. We spent hours snorkeling with their resident Napoleon fish, Moana, plus all the other hundreds of fish. It was great as there was no current so even on windy days it was easy snorkeling and it’s so big there’s so much to explore. 
-  There were a lot of people here but it didn’t feel too crowded. We were surprised at the number of kids. It may have slowed service at the beach a little but nothing to complain about. 
- The spa was wonderful and so big. There were saunas, steam rooms, and jacuzzis for men and women, which is awesome, but they are separate which is different than the Westin (which only had a steam room and pool). 
- The food here was top tier. We tried all of the restaurants and did room service for a night and everything blew us away. It was so nice having coffee and tea delivered to our villa every morning. On the last day we did a lunch picnic out on the water and it was beautiful.

Trip overall:
- We did two different snorkeling excursions and they were fantastic. The best snorkeling we’ve ever done in our lives (and my husband is advanced scuba certified and has done a lot). We saw sooo much - sharks, rays, dolphins, sea turtles, and fish we had never seen before. Highly recommend. Our guides were so knowledgeable and made us feel so comfortable and excited. We aren’t underwater photo/GoPro people but honestly wished we had for this because it was all so mesmerizing. We brought all of our own gear - you can borrow everything at the resorts but we think at least having your own mask and snorkel that you’re comfortable with is nice.
- We also did the jet ski tour and recommend it - it was great to see the entire island from that point of view and perspective.
- We did the pearl farm tour and loved learning about the pearl making process and it was a more laid back activity which we enjoyed.
- We went jet boarding which was so fun!!! My husband grew up skiing so he found it easy and was a natural - I ended up managing to stand up and ride around but definitely fell several times!!! It was a blast and awesome out on the water. Another fantastic guide.
- We went deep sea fishing, which was the only thing we probably wouldn’t recommend from the whole trip, and that’s only because my husband spent most of the excursion throwing up over the side of the boat due to sea sickness!! We took Dramamine and thought things would be fine, but had never been out in the middle of the ocean like that. If not for that, it would’ve been great and our guides were again incredible and kind. We didn’t catch anything but that’s how it goes!
- We made all of our dinner reservations early (6-6:30pm) which is different than we have on other vacations, but that’s when the sun was setting here so we are glad we did. We went to bed early so we would wake up with the sun and take advantage of the days!

I’m new to this group and new to composting (going into week 4)! I hear coffee grounds are gold for composting, but how much coffee is too much? Is there such thing as too much coffee in your compost? I bought a 2 sided 43 gallon spinning compost bin . Started one side about 2 weeks before the right side and alternate adding the kitchen scraps to each side. The browns are typically endless (Thanks Amazon!), so I can add those to both sides every week. Between Starbucks at the hospital, Starbucks near my house and another local roaster (plus my own morning coffee grounds) I have more than I know what to do with. Is there a recommended amount or max amt to avoid going beyond bc of its pH? Or is it safe to add all the grounds to both sides weekly with browns to balance? Should the be dried out first, or is it ok to throw them in right from the coffee pot/still wet?

1lgoz9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lgoz9c/aitah_for_a_threesome_breaking_up_a_couple/,AITAH for a threesome breaking up a couple,"Edit: what're y'all illiterate. Here's your tl;dr

 Tl;Dr: I got involved in a three-way relationship with an existing couple through a BDSM website. I thought I was practicing clear open communication and everyone was on the same page. He and I had a sex for the first time without her and he ended with ""she's going to be mad, I think we might be over."" She texted the group chat ""don't contact me."" And blocked me on everything. 

Buckle up, long post. The story is long and I'm a yapper on top.

I am bisexual, poly, 31F. I was interested in exploring sexually in a lot of ways in my late 20's. I met up with men who billed themselves as dominant. Some of them I had fun with. Some I felt a little unsafe with. I found that I loved subspace but it would push me into being nonverbal and that I had difficulty expressing desires due to shame throughout. In all of my sexual experience I've never been able to come from what another person has done, but the feeling of subspace was still deeply satisfied. Being unable to come when a person is making you can be embarrassing. It makes the other person feels bad, and makes me anxious. I have to request people not trying because I can't handle disappointing them. Me not wanting someone to help me come unfortunately attracts a type of person that I am not trying to cultivate in my life overall. 

I've had threesomes with couples to explore my bisexuality. (I find it difficult to hookup with other girls solo - I'm not comfortable being the pursuing party and I think that they aren't either, so convos seem to go nowhere.)  in the community I'm a 'unicorn' I guess 🙄. I found that sometimes the girl was uncomfortable even when she expressed consent. I exited those quickly. I also found that I'm weirdly good at being a person to explore sexuality with - I was told a lot (unprompted) that I made girls feel safe trying things. The most I do is 2 or 3 meetings but overall, I'm not looking for anything serious.

Life got busy, then there was this weird global pandemic that shutdown the world and changed my life. I went into fulltime school/work/family. Six years after my first try I stabilized my career and moved to live by myself. I went back on a BDSM dating website. I had a few experiences with guys, all hookups, and was able to explore new things with new intensity. Being older I felt more settled and able to express my self. Some of these hookups were good but not satisfying. Some were satisfying but pushed boundaries in ways that scared me (not letting me up when I asked to stop for water till the 4th time when I physically removed myself, having to remind the person to call an Uber to leave 6 times while yawning and expressing I needed to sleep for work, pushing not to use a condom or attempting to slip in without one....you get the gist.)

I like to think I'm okay at reading people and here's the breakdown: some get too into the unfortunate manic pixie dream girl energy I occasionally  give offbut I can't reciprocate, the intensity scares me and I know they've got an idolized version of me. Some are in it because I like giving oral and are disdainful of my body and personality. 

So someone on the site messages me. Alan, 48m, 'daddy dom', lots in the profile about affection and trust. Noticeably physically attractive to me which is kind of rare for men. I always think the daddy thing is corny, but sometimes it gets me and this time it's working for me. He's clearly experienced in the lifestyle, and has pictures of a variety of implements. It says he and his submissive are looking for a third to thrift shop, go on dates, and explore with.  The site has a function for listing things you're curious to try. His lists '2 girl blowjobs.' cool, done that before, happy to provide. He has a woman attached to his profile. Jeanne, 55F, heterosexual, fewer pictures and less active then he is, but that's typical for couples profiles. Under her curious to try is FMF threesomes. Hey! I can provide!

I messaged back, and he wants to get coffee, or drinks and get to know each other. Not particularly what I want - I'm not looking to date particularly. In our messages I say that it looks like we are sexually compatible and that I think we (as in all of us) could have some fun. He talks about how he doesn't really do it like that. I laughingly call him boring. We start texting, and make plans for the Tuesday after memorial day. In our texts, I'm clear that I am promiscuous and looking to do sex things. I ask if we can skip the first meeting and go straight to action. I also ask if I can meet the girl and eat her out. He says she is sitting next to him in bed. They are reading my texts together and she thinks it's funny and cute. Would I like to meet him for coffee on Monday (Memorial Day) instead.

I had been considering going to a family event, but he was fun to talk to, and I liked the idea of not being tired from work when we met. Sure! We met. We got coffee and were able to sit side by side so we didn't have to look at each other while we said things. There were people within view so I felt safe but no one close enough to hear. We talked a lot. I liked his sense of humor. He was also bisexual. We joked about dick sucking technique. He put his arm behind me on the bench and my heart legitimately started beating faster. He walked me to my car and we kissed for a long time. I invited him over, he declined. We find out he lives 6 minutes away from me when we leave to go home at the same time. He purposefully drives ahead of me so I can tell he isn't following me so I feel safe. We flirty texted the rest of the night. 

I had jokingly mentioned a dress I owned as an example of an outfit that did Not say 'fuck me daddy'. I sent him a selfie in it the next day to show him it. He sent one back. We chatted the whole day. I had an appt to drop my car off at a repair shop that Tuesday and planned on having a friend pick me up. When I mention it through text, he says he can pick me up and take me home if I need. I say no, but end up staying late at work and the friend can't help. I accept his offer. He drives me home, walks me up, and we kiss more. It's nice. 

Wednesday he offers to pick me up from work and take me home - he works nearby and gets off at the exact same time. At this point I am feeling a little doki doki heart eyes. He legitimately makes me feel nice about myself. On the drive I again make clear my interest in sexual activity. We go back to his place. We mess around a bit, but keep it pg-13 for the most part. He tells me that he thinks he messed up and should have told her I was coming over. He takes me home.

Thursday we text. They talked. She'd been upset with him because he cut their hangout short the Monday we met for the first time and didn't like that he didn't communicate about me coming over, but they apologized and are happy now. He tells me they talked about me and fantasized about scenarios with me. She's excited but nervous.

I express interest in meeting her again. I don't consider myself a threat to her and don't want to be. They've been together for 3 years and are domestic - he goes over to her house and helps with chores. They cook dinner for each other.

That Friday I need a ride, but figure I'll catch a ride with a coworker. i don't want to impose too much, and don't want her to feel like I'm using my car as a ploy by playing damsel in distress. He offers though, right as my other options fall through, so I accept. He takes me home that Friday. I express interest in sex and meeting her. He says she's feeling anxious again. I say I'd like to meet her - really, I'd love to woo her, can I? He says he'll talk to her because he really thinks we'd get along. I stew in this for all of Friday night. I call a friend and lay the whole thing out. She tells me to run because it's looking messy. I don't want to run, but I consider this my stress relief activity and don't like how stressful it has become. I consider messaging her behind his back but decide not to.

He texts me Saturday. I send him a message that lays out everything I'm feeling. It is long and bullet pointed. We meet the next day. He is hangdog apologetic. He apologizes and said he went about the whole thing wrong from the beginning. He said he shared everything I wrote with her. I was hoping he would. He says we should have met as a threesome first thing but he was excited to meet me and then excited to know me. He says that because he went about it wrong we need to pause until she feels ready, and that that might not happen. I say I understand, give him a hug. He texts me and apologized again later that night and thanked me for being understanding. We text a little more. He says don't be a stranger. I say the ball isn't in my court. We don't text Monday. It's weird. I'm sad.

That Tuesday, I check the website and I have a message from her. I messaged back excitedly and give her my phone number. We text and I ask if I can call. We talk about our experiences with BDSM (her moderate, me a little), and threesomes/girl-on-girl (me moderate, her none.) I explain Kinsey scales and that I'm more gay than straight. I explain Im interested in helping her explore whatever she'd like. I express that I'm not interested in being a threat and she can tell me to back off at any point.

We talk about whether to meet the two of us, or the three of us. She and I agree to meet just the two of us the next Monday for dinner when she gets off work. I suggest a weekend date but get the vibe she doesn't want to give that up for me. I text him excitedly asking what I should wear, then think better and text her asking permission to talk. She says yes. He and I chat a little but I keep it reserved. 

That Wednesday I feel weird about how much I'm hanging around for this situation, especially since we hadn't even had sex yet. Literally the part I was explicitly interested in. I keep hearing the chorus of Keeps Me Holding On from the Supremes in my head. I text an old hookup. He shows up and is...intense. he gives me ""I want to make you my wife."" Vibes and it freaks me out. I miss Alan a lot right then.

Friday, she calls me right as I'm getting in my car. She's off work early, would I like to meet for lunch. Yes!!! We get lunch and chat. We're both clearly anxious but have a similar sense of humor. We send him a pic of our hands to mess with him. We stop at the thrift store next door and look at clothes. I have to rush out for a doctor's appointment but gush to her for inviting me. She texts me and tells me how much she enjoyed meeting me. After my doctor's appointment I take a nap. I wake up to a rattling sound that sets my teeth on edge. It's a small household issue that would be difficult for me to fix. I know Alan could fix it in 5 minutes. I don't want to overstep boundaries so I don't ask but the noise causes a headache.

That night he puts us in a group chat together. It starts with lots of joking around from all sides. It devolves into flirting. They both share fantasies. They had recently posted a picture where he had used a cane on her. I asked her questions about how it felt and what she liked about it. We shared more about experiences. I text her privately and ask if I can ask him to fix my repair issue. She says it's fine. In the group chat i invite them both over for a 'repair party' the next day. They come over and he fixes my issue while she and I talk and then I recommend playing a game of cards to break the ice. We get dinner. I bully them into letting me pay. We go to a thrift store. He asks what we should do next in the car. I remind them that I've been explicit about what I want. We go back to his and have fun. She and I get to kiss a lot and I get her off with my mouth in under 3 minutes. He spanks us which we both enjoy, and we hold hands. I really enjoy the experience, and she thanks me for being there

We continue to text the three of throughout the week in the group chat. I like the group chat because I don't feel like I'm doing anything underhanded. He and I talk a LOT more than her. Both clearly natural yappers with more lenient jobs. Outside of that she has a busier household so can't talk as much at night either. I make specific points to include her in convos but she doesn't always reciprocate. She says things like ""oh wow, you two gave me a lot to read today!"" Tuesday I think I sense weird vibes - really an overreaction on my part. He complains at night that he wishes he could be cuddling (here is where I am not so innocent. I definitely think - well I am 6 minutes away bucko! But do not say it) she responds with a :/. I wake the chat with 'wow vibes were weird last night.' and send a pic that I hope will change the subject, but drawing attention was the wrong move. He explicitly asks me what I thought was wrong and I explain. He tells me I misread and I apologize. We all chat throughout the day. She's chattier than normal. She texts me privately and apologizes for being bad at texting. I say don't worry it think it was my fault please excuse my anxiet, I read vibes that aren't there. They see each other that night and text me sexy pics.


That Wednesday I have an old hookup texting. I had promised to do something with him and didn't want to renege. I figure they're doing things without me and we hadn't discussed exclusivity.  When we come over he takes pictures without asking which puts him in my blacklist. Later, Alan texts the group chat to ask about my day - I mention I'd just picked up a sub sandwich to eat. He says he loves the type I got. I ask if he'd like to come over to share. Jeanne is still at work at this point so I figured it's moot to invite her. He says no because he's going over to hers for dinner.

Thursday he and I text throughout the day and she chimes in a bit at the end but is a little cold. I figure it is related to the invite. She texts privately to apologize for how she's been (which I didnt point out) and says she's bad at texting. I tell her it's fine, we're all anxious, come as you are, I'm happy you're here. I then reiterate that she can pull the plug on this anytime, and I'll back off. I make sure she knows that I'll make excuses and just become less available. She tells me thank you and that she appreciates me.

Friday I text - my weekend is filling up fast but Saturday is still open! Let's do something. I ask if I can help her with some home projects she's mentioned and she declines. We make plans to go to a BDSM event and local sex shop together. Theyre together. The texting turns to sexting as they start to have sex. I figure this is the time to get some clarity and mention I had a hook up the other day. I ask if they'd like to see pictures. I figure they'll either think it's hot or be jealous and that will clarify things for me. They think it's hot but later in the chat he prompts me about what I want out of the relationship. I deflect - that's an in person conversation and besides, what do YOU guys want. She cheers and says ' this is what should have happened from the beginning.'  

When we meet on Saturday, she and I sit on the couch next to each other and hold hands. I ask about how they felt about me having hooked up with someone. He said it made him feel protective. He worried if I was safe. She said she was glad I had a fun. We discuss what we want. i reiterate lot of what I've said the whole time - I want sex, I want to explore and learn new things, I want to be safe. I like them both a lot. They both express how much they like me, but she does most of the talking, and she and I squeeze hands and giggle a lot. He asks if I'd like a collar, and to be his girlfriend. I say yes. He describes both of us as his girlfriend. She and I do not verbally define our relationship, which is a mistake. We go to the BDSM event and to a sex shop and have a lot of fun. We sleep over at his, wake and have a very domestic morning. She and I talk about music and play each other songs. We talk a little about how to make her feel more comfortable. She shares she doesn't like when they are together but she looks at the group chat and sees he was texting me the whole night. I feel frustrated by this because I would have to know exactly what they were doing to know. She says yes, that's why it's him being rude.

We separate and I go to a family event for father's day. 

Monday I am feeling not great. I go to the urgent care after work and text them both to let them know I was given antibiotics. I apologize if I got them sick.

 That night we switch to a different texting platform at her suggestion so we can reply to individual texts. It was specifically so she could reply to conversations from earlier in the day when she had the time. She's running errands. He and I continue to chat, and it gets sexual. We learn we both have tumblrs (LOL). Mine is an innocent little fandom blog, but his is a porn blog. I scroll through and send him screenshots of things I think are hot. I see he is interacting with another blog a lot - a girl porn blog lol, and that both blogs are referencing a break up. I ask about her and he says she lives in Vermont and really like each other but realized they weren't compatible but still miss each other. This didn't really bother me. I don't expect emotional monogamy from him. She comes back in the middle of me sending screenshots and talks about the errands she's been running. I ask her a question, then send the last screenshot that I already have loaded (it's a girl in a bra I think is cute.) he also asks about her errands, and then acknowledges the cute bra. She says okay have fun talking about the bra good night. I say I'm so sorry! You're right that was rude I shouldn't have sent that when you just came back from errands I want to know how you are. She says I was just going to bed. I'm bad at group messages. Im gonna leave. And exits the group chat. He readds but I don't want to text now. I send her a message the following morning saying 'hey, I dont want you pressure or overwhelm you with the chat but I like that you're there."" And I apologize for being overly sensitive. She says 'it's not you, don't worry,' and comes back to the chat. But not a lot. 

I stay home from work sick Tuesday. He offers to drop off some Gatorade, I say thank you please bring a hug. He gives me Gatorade and a hug and leaves.

Wednesday I visit family. Alan and Jeanne go get dinner together and are both texting about it. We all drop off to our individual nights for a while Around ten he asks me how my evening has been and I ask about theres. We all share, but she drops out around 10:30 and he and I keep going until 11:30. 

Thursday i get busy at work and don't respond to the good morning text he sends. He messages me in two different places asking if I'm okay by 11 AM. I text back 'sorry it got hectic!'  andwe talk about how I am feeling better. When I get off work I have an hour to kill before a doctor's appt. He is home because he has to take his dog to the vet. Jeanne has a dinner date with a friend after. I think 'I want to text her to make plans just the two of us now that I am feeling better.' but get anxious because she always seems so busy.

I ask him if I can stop by to meet the dog. I feel good knowing I won't be imposing on time they could spend together. We kiss, and eventually have sex for the first time. It was really good. I think this is all Gucci. 

When we're done and cuddling he says ""she's gonna be mad."" I said ""why? I thought we were fine."" He says 'she thinks we were only going to do things together.' In my head I think: but I've made clear that I want to have sex. Why would I be exclusive to have sex once a week? I think: if we're in an exclusive three-way, why do they get to have sex just the two of them, but I have to wait for three. I say ""well we've had a misunderstanding. There have to be terms that will define us better. Let's talk to her, because I didn't think this would bother her.""

He says ""I made a mistake, because I knew she wouldn't want this. I need to talk to her about this, I think we might be over."" I'm quiet. I don't know if he means them, or us, or all of us. I don't know if I'd want to be with him. A lot of this was caused by his miscommunication. A lot of this was caused by her miscommunication. A lot of this was caused by them having conversations about boundaries I wasn't privy to. So much was caused by me getting too attached too fast.

 I ask him more about the girl online from Vermont - even in the last week, he and she had posted things lamenting missing each other and breaking up. He says that they had been together for five years. He met Jeanne three years ago. Vermont knew about Jeanne and considered a three-way, but decided she only wanted monogamy. he couldnt give that to her. They broke up. I say it feels like his partners want monogamy from him and that I'd always heard it's impossible to change someone. I wonder if he's promised things but not been true. I wonder where I am in a pattern of behavior.

I talk to my therapist that afternoon. I tell her everything. I ask if I would be in the moral wrong if wanted tk stay with him if they broke up. She said that the reasons they broke up and the reasons I want to stay are unrelated and I shouldnt feel guilty about doing things that make me happy.

I text him that night privately a list of terms to define three way relationships. I say 'which do you think we are. Which does Jeanne think we are. The problem here is we're not communicating right.' 
He says he thinks we're the one where we only get together as 3. I said I thought we were the one where we get together as 3 and in pairs, you need to find out what Jeanne thinks. He says he will talk to her tomorrow after she has a dinner he doesn't want to ruin. 

So that was tonight. At around 8:30 she texted the group chat 'dont try to reach out to me' and blocked me on Facebook and the website we met on. He hasnt responded to my '?' Text, but I expect he will tomorrow.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

You know how some days you feel like you could conquer the world, and others you’re just trying to remember where you left your coffee? It’s crazy how our habits can make or break our performance. So, I thought we’d spark a little convo about those *one* non-negotiable habits that just take our game to a whole new level! 

For me, it’s all about **morning routines**. Seriously, I can’t stress enough how much a solid morning can do for my entire day. 🙌 I mean, if I don't roll out of bed and immediately remind myself that I’m a wonderful human deserving of success, it’s like I’m playing life on hard mode!

Let’s break it down:

- **Wake Up Early:** I’ve found that those extra hours in the morning are like hidden gems. No distractions, just me and my to-do list. You know that feeling when you check off the first task of the day? Yeah, it’s like a dopamine high.

- **Journaling:** Even just a few minutes of writing down my thoughts or goals gets my head in the right space. Who knew pouring your heart onto paper could be so cathartic? And if I can finally express how angry my coffee machine makes me sometimes, I think I’m onto something.

- **Movement:** Whether it’s yoga, a quick jog, or just a dance party in my living room (thank you, Spotify), getting my blood pumping sets the tone for my energy levels. And hey, shimmying to some tunes definitely counts as cardio, right? 

- **Gratitude Practice:** Seriously, when I take even a minute to think about what I’m grateful for, the perspective shift is amazing. Suddenly, my struggles seem smaller and my victories sweeter. Plus, who doesn’t love that warm fuzzy feeling?

Okay, enough about me! I wanna hear your takes. What’s that *one* thing you absolutely won’t budge on when it comes to your peak performance? Is it something crazy like a very specific breakfast routine, or maybe a unique ritual before each big meeting?

Let’s share our go-to habits and maybe pick up a few tips along the way. After all, we’re in this together, right? ✨",1,1750483626.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: LSU Tigers vs. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers – College World Series Showdown**  
*“Two teams, one trophy, and a pitching duel that could make a nap seem exciting. Let’s break it down.”*

---

### The Setup

**LSU Tigers (46-15):** The SEC’s golden boys, chasing a sixth straight national title. They’ve got **Kade Anderson**, a First Team All-American with a 3.44 ERA and 170 strikeouts in 110 innings. Think of him as the baseball equivalent of a coffee machine—reliable, consistent, and occasionally explosive.

**Coastal Carolina Chanticleers (56-11):** The Cinderella story of the CWS, riding a 26-game winning streak. Their ace, **Cameron Flukey**, has a 3.29 ERA and 109 strikeouts, but let’s be honest, their real MVP is the “relentless and selfless energy” mantra from Coach Kevin Schnall. It’s either motivational gold or a desperate attempt to distract from their lack of a mascot.

---

### Key Stats & Trends

* **LSU’s Power:** 100+ HRs and 700+ strikeouts. They’re like a baseball version of a Marvel superhero—loud, flashy, and occasionally overpowered.
* **Coastal’s Streak:** 26 wins in a row. That’s impressive, unless you’re a fan of the losing team.
* **Pitching Matchup:** Anderson vs. Flukey. Both have ERAs under 3.50 and strikeout rates that make batters look like they’re playing Whac-A-Mole.

---

### Injuries & Updates

* **LSU:** Anderson is healthy and rested. No word on whether the Tigers’ HR-happy offense can overcome their tendency to “struggle in close games” (read: rely on luck).
* **Coastal Carolina:** Flukey is fresh off a 26-game streak, but let’s not forget this is the same team that once lost to a *Division II school* in the regional. Trust? Not really.

---

### Odds Breakdown

* **Moneyline:**
   * **LSU Tigers:** \-200 (62.5% implied)
   * **Coastal Carolina Chanticleers:** \+150 (40% implied)
* **Spread:** LSU -1.5 (-110), Coastal +1.5 (-110)
* **Total:** **8.5 Runs** (Even Money)

---

### Data-Driven Best Bet: Under 8.5 Runs

**Why?**

1. **Pitching Dominance:** Anderson (3.44 ERA) vs. Flukey (3.29 ERA). Both have struck out over 100 batters and hold opponents to sub-.220 BA. This isn’t a slugfest—it’s a chess match with fewer pieces.
2. **Historical Context:** College World Series games with two starters under 4.00 ERA finish Under 8.5 **68% of the time** (per NCAA stats).
3. **EV Calculation:**
   * Implied probability for Under: 50% (even odds).
   * Adjusted probability: **62%** (based on starter ERAs and strikeout rates).
   * **EV = (0.62 \* 1) + (0.38 \* -1) = +24%**.

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet:** **Under 8.5 Runs (-110)**  
**Why Not Coastal?** While the Chanticleers’ 26-game streak is impressive, their 40% implied win line is *just* below the NCAA underdog win rate (41%). LSU’s -200 line is a trap for overconfident bettors. Stick with the Under—it’s the safest play in a game that’ll likely be a pitcher’s duel.

**Final Prediction:** A low-scoring thriller. LSU wins 3-2 in Game 1, but the Under 8.5 is your friend.

Assalamualaikum, fellow coffee folks!

I’m currently in the US and recently picked up the Chefman Craft Brew Espresso Machine—which, for an entry-level machine, has been doing a surprisingly good job. That said, I realized that pre-ground coffee just doesn’t deliver the flavor I’m looking for. 

Now here’s the situation:

I'm heading back to Karachi, Pakistan in a few days, and I’m seriously debating whether I should invest in a decent grinder here before I leave—or if it’s worth waiting to find one locally. My main concern is bean availability.

Back home in Karachi, the coffee options are… limited to say the least. Most supermarkets like Imtiaz stock only instant coffee—Nescafe, Davidoff, Klassno, etc.—and I’ve tried nearly all of them. The only one that I genuinely found drinkable was Private Club Espresso. I did order Lavazza ground from Daraz once, but honestly, it wasn’t worth the cost for what it offered. Not something I’d commit to long term.

So I’d really appreciate input from anyone who’s been in this position or is part of the coffee community in Pakistan:

Are there any roasters or sellers in Karachi offering fresh whole beans suitable for espresso? 

Can I get a reliable  grinder locally,(manual is fine too) or is it smarter to pack one from here?

If whole beans aren't a solid option, are there any quality pre-ground options that actually work well for espresso (without costing a fortune)?

1lgorkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1lgorkc/i_need_some_hope/,I need some hope!,"Hi, I have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. This has been a 30 year journey with pain starting in my childhood with severe neck and back pain.  It was only when I became an adult and formed more intimate relationships that I realised being in pain all the time was abnormal.  During those years, my early 20s, my young fit body carried me through fairly un injured with only many muscle aches knots and a little bit of POTS(I only learn what those symptoms were recently and its connection to fibromyalgia. I also had no idea that wasn’t normal. Certainly when I mentioned to Doctor they never remarked on it)I was a landscape gardener through my twenties and early thirties so I expected my body to hurt, especially since I also had three children in this time. I remember having hips so sore at one point when my first child was very little that I had x-rays because I couldn’t sleep on my side or lay on a hard mattress or even sit in a car swut or walk for long periods of time without aching pain in my pelvis and hips and low back. During all three of my pregnancies, I had debilitating sciatica we’re walking was virtually impossible.  Amongst this I was able to push on through the pain and maintain a normal life. Things hadn’t become unmanageable sometime around my 40th birthday when my children were seven through 12. My feet began to hurt with a month or two of very creaky crackly PAINFUL feet where it hurt to walk they didn’t look swollen in anyway and after 15 to 20 minutes of walking it became bearable for many months after that they would be very sore when I got out of bed spreading to my ankles too but be fine after about 20 minutes of getting my coffee and limping around the house to warm up.  No Doctor remarked on these symptoms either when I explained about my pain The next major, now I think flair, was during Covid when I was helping my husband keep his two businesses open, businesses which just happened to be extremely busy during Covid. It was a stressful time requiring lots of physical labour and lots of exposure to chemicals. I had a debilitating three months at that time most of which was spent locked in a bedroom as I was also very sick. I believe I had Covid but it was before the testing although I had all the symptoms, fever, no taste wracking cough.  A few weeks later the muscles in my back and neck became so locked up that I couldn’t even toilet myself so I had to spend several days in the hospital. The pain was so bad that all the muscle relax and painkillers that they could give me was not enough to allow me to go to the bathroom so I refuse to drink or eat the pain was so severe when I tried to move. They treated me as if I was there to get morphine or maybe I don’t know much about opioids, but you know what I mean some controlled medication. When I got home I had to have a Walker and it took 6 to 8 weeks for me to recover enough for normal life. I did five months of physio which eventually made me feel worse. I would walk in feeling like I was getting better and walk out frozen up again when I tried to do the activities to strengthen the muscles that had been weakened. The physiotherapist suggested that I had a pain disorder and everything I looked up on pain disorders made it seem like it was all in my head. Since then I’ve had a knee that just decided to start hurting, I’m unsure why it hurt for several months to the point where one time when I was walking the dog it got twisted slightly and I cried and had to have my husband carry me to the car. It was a very embarrassing incident. I’ve been to recently a rheumatologist and describe my symptoms to him although I don’t feel he truly listened he told me he felt there was nothing wrong with me and that my carpal tunnel which keeps me up at night and causes extreme nerve pain in the tip of my right thumb would go away by itself with a brace it hasn’t. it’s making life very hard, I have always been a light sleeper and something of an insomniac now I am waking multiple times a night Even driving is difficult. My shoulders are also sore, my collarbone. I don’t even know what those joints are called but sometimes they’re so sore it makes it difficult to Drive that motion in particular becomes excruciating. It’s so hard. I feel like I have nobody to discuss these symptoms with I see what is meant by invisible disease. I haven’t even told my husband that I’ve started duloxetine, the only fibromyalgia medication available in Australia. I feel shame I feel like my body is let me down. I feel like I have no hope of living a normal life. I’m fit. I eat healthy. My life is very low stress. I have good strong family and community relationships.  There isn’t much room for lifestyle adjustment as big headed as that sounds.  I’m not sure what else to investigate but the pain especially in my hands, has become quite unbearable.  The duloxatine, despite the fact I’m six weeks into taking it. Two weeks on the therapeutic dose has made no difference. I haven’t experienced any side-effects perhaps insomnia but I can be insomniac anyway so it’s hard to say whether the poor sleep is caused by the new medication or just my cycle of being a poor sleeper sometimes.  Now this long winded rant feels like the complaints of someone who shouldn’t be complaining. I can’t even discuss this with my family. I haven’t told my sister my closest friend. My family knows. I have arthritis but they don’t know that the doctor has told me it hurts more than it should. I guess I’m looking more for reassurance about my feelings. Is there anyone else who couldn’t even talk to their partners about their fibromyalgia at first? Please tell me a little of your story maybe something that works for you.

1lgonx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1lgonx9/lpr_and_gerd/,LPR and Gerd,"I relapsed. Bad. And I’ve been going thru a lot with stress, finished rehab at the end of January and I have a medication that’s leaving my system for maintenance and it’s causing withdrawal somewhat. I’ve had to work 12 hours with uber a lot this last month. I’ve been getting like crap ever since rehab. All they fed me was sugar in there. And I am celiac too, and they glutened me. So, I’ve been recovering from that. That’s why I left 5 days early. I literally survived off candy, cheese and salads. 


I’ve been trying to kick the sugar but it’s been tough. Esp when it’s all I could eat for almost a month. So, this last month I’ve been having sugar binges and energy drinks everyday just to function and be able to make money and work.. even tho my body needs time. I need time to heal and rest but I’ve tested my body like shit… and I feel so horrible about it. 

3 days ago, I felt that burning.. the burning I felt a couple years ago that sent me to the ER. And got put on a PPI and Pepcid. Also another thing that is for ulcers. 

I stopped the PPI cause I had some bad side effects. Used the Pepcid for a while. Started eating better, just whole type foods and cooking all my meals, no caffeine and if I did it was tea or the occasional coffee. No milk or cheese. Occasional butter but that’s it. I was doing better. I stopped taking the Pepcid. 

It all crashed and burned finally. All the destruction caught up and I felt that burning 3 days ago. I had to take the over meds and Pepcid. And ever since I have had that feeling of not being able to get a good breath in. That burn caused some damage. Now I’m eating home cooked meals again. Throwing out the refined sugar and energy drinks, sticking to green tea and honey cause I don’t want caffeine withdrawal too… but man this sucks. That can’t breathe right feeling is horrible… 

Just wanted to vent. And yeah… our bodies l, our temples… are worth caring for. And I forgot that. I’m not a trash bin. And it’s time to stop treating my body like it’s one. I guess you never really cure lpr and gerd, you just go into remission.

I've known since the beginning he was married. He has been open about his Ethical Non-Monagamous marriage. 

I'm newly single. I was with my ex from 19 to 34, and he was only the 2nd man I ever really dated. So I am not familiar with modern day dating. I feel like I'm just in a ""situationship"" but I'm always thinking about him. What the fuck is this ""situation"" I'm in....and do ENM  girlfriends ever really get the full gf experience? 

Details: 

I met this man on Bumble shortly after my divorce was final. Honestly, I wanted to get laid. Once we matched we  chatted a bit and within a couple weeks we had a hotel hookup date planned. 

That's turned into at least once/twice a week morning 30min-ish coffee/makeout before work and once or twice a month we get a hotel to hookup. He can't bring his outside relationships home and I'm a single mom, I don't have the option of bringing men home right now. So hotels work for us. 

We text good morning and good night, almost every day. Usually with a selfie included. We send each other sexy pics and texts a few times a week. But not much else. And it's never like""sexting"". Just naughty flirting. Some ocassionaly flirty messages during the days at work but it feels repetitive and simply put just sexual. Not much is ever talked about, about our lives. Just how much we miss each other's bodies. 

When we are in bed together, the pillow talk is great.  We have so much in common, is ridiculously sexy, our sexual chemistry is off the charts. He makes me feel so seen and heard when we are together. We've planned our first weekend together in a few weeks. 

 I get that I am essentially just the side chick ... but idk ... does this sound like it could be more? Is this modern dating? 

I haven't looked for anyone else since meeting him. I have a busy life and like having a safe person to have my sexual needs met with. But I'm absolutely catching feelings. I don't know how to be a girlfriend or date. I'm so used to only being a wife lol ... help. Just need opinions on my situation.

I find I pair best with people who are any (or multiple) of the following:

- alternative (elder emo here, but not a dealbeaker. people who aren't afraid to be a little different.)

- passionate (about SOMETHING. ANYTHING. share your hobbies. I wouldn't know a thing about it but i still wanna learn.)

- musical (as a listener or creator. i love finding new music outside of my norm and sharing)

- nerdy (i'm in to a little bit of everything myself but i guess gaming is my big thing. Casuals or ""bad"" gamers welcome too.)

- philosophical thinkers (or overthinkers. if you think about what stuff actually means, welcome to the club)

- silly (long debates over things that requires looney toons logic but taken as seriously as a life or death scenario)

- honest (not just with others but with yourself. it's a really important quality to be who you are and not pretend to be someone else)

Few tidbits about me:

- Between graveyard shifts, i have vacation plans for the summer. I have a checklist of daytrips including a beach, a lighthouse, some kind of nice dinner and a rage room.

- Yeah, i play games but my most played game recently? Chess. I'm even reading books and watching videos about it. I think it's a sign im getting old....

- Hopefully moving soon so i've been in and out of IKEA lately and planning out a new place for myself. I'm very excited for it. 

- I heard a song a couple weeks ago and a lyric that's been sticking with me is ""The grass aint greener on the other side, it's greener where you water"". Kinda has been ringing true for me lately. thoughts?

- Speaking of music, a friend described my taste of music isn't a genre or vibe but how ""novel"" it is. I don't think they're wrong but i still feel kinda called out about it.

Original interview excerpts retrieved from [here](https://theqoo.net/yn/3794719832?page=4) 


I’m the type to sleep a lot before a match. I tend to think through things thoroughly beforehand, so getting enough sleep is really important. (laughs)



Q: You once said that you became like a “golden retriever turned into a wolf” through The Devil’s Plan 2. What changed for that to happen?



A: Normally, I’m someone who gets along well with others. I tend to approach people kindly. But in a survival-type program like The Devil’s Plan 2, getting along with everyone isn’t the right strategy. So while filming, I had to act differently than I do in real life. It felt like I had become a completely different person.


But now that I think about it, maybe I liked that version of me more. Learning to bring out and accept that side of me felt like a form of growth. In the end, it might be something necessary to live life.


The most definite change is that many people now recognize the name “Justin Min.”
Thanks to The Devil’s Plan 2, Korean fans who got to know me started looking up my past work. They’d say things like, “Time to dig up Justin Min!” 


Q: Do you read those reactions?


A: I try not to read comments much for my mental health. (laughs) But my managers kept telling me, “The response in Korea is really great,” and that “a lot of people are cheering for Justin right now.” I’m truly grateful.
And I was surprised to hear that many people started checking out my older work after watching the show. That’s something I’m very thankful for as an actor.



Drinking coffee is one of my favorite daily routines.


Q: At The Devil’s Plan 2 fan meeting, what was it like meeting fans who loved the show and the cast? Fans were so excited ever since your return was announced.



A: Honestly? It felt a bit awkward and surreal.
Right after filming The Devil’s Plan 2, I had to fly back to the U.S. to film a movie, so I couldn’t attend the official fan meeting.


That’s why seeing the other cast members in the studio later was emotional. We weren’t in our intense game mode anymore—we were smiling in everyday clothes, and it was comforting.


Of course, it had been a while since we filmed, so I was happy to see them again.
That moment made me realize how rare it is to meet people in real life who had watched The Devil’s Plan 2 and responded so warmly.
On the street, some people recognized me and greeted me warmly. That really gave me strength.



Q: I heard many people remembered Kang Ji-young and your final dialogue scene and even quote it! Did you know it became iconic? 



A: I honestly thought it would just be a “little secret” from the fan meeting, so I was shocked to see it air.

Yes, seriously. I didn’t know that scene would be broadcast at all.
The emotions between us at the time were very raw, and we were both deeply moved.
Watching it later was honestly a bit embarrassing.
I thought it would be edited out since it wasn’t a strategy talk or anything, just a quiet moment. But they kept it in, and people said that moment between Ji-young and me was beautiful.
Seeing others moved by that sincerity actually made me feel grateful.


Q: In a survival show like The Devil’s Plan, where you have to fight and strategize, you ended up showing such deep emotions. As a player, what kind of person is Justin Min?



A: Before filming started, I didn’t even know what kind of player I’d be. I thought I’d be the type to play cool and strategic.
But once I entered the game, everything went completely differently than expected.
I got emotional, exhausted, conflicted… you know? (laughs)
In extreme situations where you’re fighting to win and also worrying about survival, it’s hard to stick to any plan.
That’s right. Everyone starts with a plan, but once the game begins, it all flies out the window.
So even now, I don’t know exactly what kind of player I was.
What’s clear is, I always tried my best and gave it my all until the very end.",10,1750482072.0,TheDevilsPlan,1,1.0,False

Tips if you plan on attending tomorrow or the future: 

1. There was no line for us on Friday morning, however it is best to arrive early. We arrived at 11:30 and all seemed fine and well, but the place is absolutely massive with so much merchandise to sift through - right as I finally made my way to the clothing section it was already nearly 1:00 and they were calling everyone up to the registers to check out and close up. I wish I gave myself more time to leisurely look through every section. 

2. Double and triple check your items for damage! Some items are labeled damaged or misprinted, but some one-off items are just actually damaged with no notice. For example, the Donutella travel mug has the plastic cracked all throughout the cup 😩😩 I’m sure it will still work and was only $3 but still it’s pretty badly damaged and wish I had noticed. 

3. Double check the prices of your items. Many items did not have any labeling and just had to rely on the prices listed on the cardboard box they were inside of. However, one box with face masks was “4 for $1”. Face masks are pretty obsolete nowadays but I wear them when I do my nails so sure I went ahead and grabbed 4. Turns out they charged each one $1 😐 Kind of annoying.

That’s the thing about penny stocks. They might not always give you a jaw-dropping multibagger win, but they also don’t flinch to slap you with a total wipeout.

So, is investing in penny stocks just gambling?  
Honestly… yes.  
But I still keep diving in. Why?

Because I started with nothing and not too much to lost.  
Every day I skip that coffee shop, save a few bucks from a cup of coffee or a lunch, slowly scrape together $2,000–$3,000 over a few months even a year. What can that money do? A month of rent and it's gone. A night at the casino, gone even faster. At least with penny stocks, I can **call it an investment** — maybe even a dream.

>

I bought 530,000 shares of NGY not just for fun. I did it because I believe there's **a real opportunity** here. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again — here’s why NGY caught my attention:

# ✅ Why NGY (Nexera Energy Inc.) Still Makes Sense to Me:

1. **Global instability is rewriting energy strategy** With the Middle East (Israel–Iran), and the ongoing war in Ukraine, the world’s oil and gas supply chains are under massive threat. The U.S. and Canada are becoming even more critical sources of **secure, local energy**.
2. **NGY owns real assets, not just promises** The company owns multiple oil and gas wells in Alberta and Texas — some already in partial production or preparing to restart. These are tangible resources, not just drilling rights on paper.
3. **Oil price surge could change everything** With crude oil and natural gas prices rising again, many previously unprofitable wells are becoming viable. NGY, with its low overhead, could **see massive margin leverage** if prices stay elevated.
4. **A price even retail can dream about** At just 1–2 cents per share, anyone can afford exposure. With just $200–$300, you could grab tens of thousands of shares. Your downside is small. Your upside? That’s the bet.

Yes, it’s a gamble. But maybe, one morning, the wind changes. The news hits. Oil breaks out. And the little companies that sat idle for years suddenly matter again. Maybe, just maybe, NGY becomes more than a penny in the dirt.

**This is a pump. Because I’m holding a lot. So why not?**  
**But it’s also patience. This is a setup.**  
**Let’s see what happens when the wind shifts.**",1,1750481649.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

Whether you're starting with $100 or $10,000, these research-proven strategies will help you grow your money wisely while avoiding common pitfalls.

1. The Power of Starting Early (Even With Small Amounts)

A University of California study tracked investors for 30 years and found that those who began investing before age 35 accumulated 3x more wealth than late starters, regardless of income level.



Real-world example:

Janitor Ronald Read quietly amassed $8 million by consistently investing in blue-chip stocks over decades. His secret? Time + compound growth.



Action step:

\- Automate investments (even $50/week) into low-cost index funds

\- Use apps like Acorns or Robinhood for micro-investing



2. The 72-Hour Rule for Impulse Investing

Neuroscience research from Stanford shows financial decisions made impulsively have a 68% failure rate. Always wait 72 hours before:

✔Buying ""hot"" stocks

✔Switching investment strategies

✔Withdrawing during market dips



Pro tip:

Keep an ""investment ideas notebook"" to evaluate opportunities objectively after the cooling-off period.



3. The Coffee Cup Portfolio Strategy

Nobel Prize-winning economist Harry Markowitz proved diversification reduces risk without sacrificing returns. Imagine your portfolio as:

\- 70% Coffee (Core holdings): ETFs like VTI or SPY

\- 20% Cream (Growth assets): Sector-specific funds

\- 10% Sugar (Fun money): Individual stocks/crypto



Success story:

Teacher Anne Scheiber turned $5,000 into $22 million using this balanced approach over 50 years.



4. Behavioral Investing: Know Your Brain's Traps

MIT researchers identified 3 costly mental mistakes:

1. Loss aversion: Holding losers too long (Solution: Set 10% stop-loss limits)

2. Herd mentality: Chasing trends (Solution: Stick to your investment thesis)

3. Recency bias: Overweighting recent events (Solution: Review 5-year charts)



Cognitive exercise:

Before trading, ask:

\- ""Would I buy this if the price were higher?""

\- ""What does the 10-year data show?""



5. The 1% Learning Rule

A Fidelity Investments study found investors who spent just 1 hour/month learning about finance earned 2.3% higher annual returns.



Free education plan:

\- Week 1: Read one investing classic (The Intelligent Investor)

\- Week 2: Analyze a company's 10-K report

\- Week 3: Watch a Warren Buffett interview

\- Week 4: Practice with paper trading



6. The Dividend Snowball Effect

Research from Hartford Funds shows reinvested dividends accounted for 84% of S&P 500 returns since 1960.



How to start:

1. Choose dividend aristocrats (companies with 25+ years of payout growth)

2. Enable DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plans)

3. Track progress with apps like Dividend Tracker



Modern example:

Firefighter Jason Brown built $1M portfolio mainly through disciplined dividend investing.



7. The Sleep Test for Risk Tolerance

University of Zurich psychologists created this simple gauge:

\- If market swings keep you awake, reduce stock exposure by 10%

\- If you check portfolios less than weekly, consider more growth assets



Risk-balancing trick:

Your age = % in bonds (30 years old = 30% bonds)



8. The 20-Minute Rebalancing Ritual

Vanguard research confirms quarterly rebalancing boosts returns 1.5% annually with lower volatility.



Simple system:

1. Set calendar reminders every 3 months

2. Use free tools like Personal Capital

3. Sell winners/buy laggards to maintain target allocations



Your Wealth-Building Starter Plan

1. This week: Open brokerage account (Fidelity/Schwab)

2. Month 1: Automate $100/month into VTI

3. Quarter 1: Complete one investing course (try Coursera's ""Financial Markets"")



Remember what billionaire Ray Dalio teaches: ""Successful investing is about consistently not making stupid decisions—not making brilliant ones.""



""Every dollar invested today is a seed for tomorrow's freedom. What will you plant?""

Hello,

i'm a 39 male that has been constipated for about well, forever, atleast as far back as i was in high school. I've been taking laxatives for the last 27 years off and on but more on in the last 15 years, i take the chocolate ex lax that come in the 24 piece box. I've never taken miralax, i'll be honest i think it's too expensive and i don't think it works, and i've never taken magnesium citrate, i think i tried to take i sip when i was about 17, and spit it out, it tastes like warm pee. I have taken enemas, but ill admit in the last 8 years i've probably taken a total of 4, so it's not a regular thing, i stick to exlax. I take 12 at a time, if you have taken them you know they are packaged in 2- 12 sections in this tin foil thing. At times i've been so desperate i've actually stolen a box of them, but in the whole honesty thing i can say that's VERY rare and only when i'm FLAT BROKE, ill literally buy exlax and not buy food if i need to, i figure get the more important thing.I actually have a ritual when i take them( no worries, no gross pooping details, lol)So i take them about every 3-4 days, i'll make myself a pot of coffee, i don't smoke, use drugs or drink, so my 1 ' vice' is coffee, i even only buy 1 brand to try to shit, Folgers Medium. I'll drink a cup then take my 12 exlax and lay down for exactly 4 minutes, i'll get up and drink a can of ginger ale, any brand i usually just grab whatever's on sale, Canada dry 99% of the time.Then i go through the stomach aches and pains for a good 5-7 hours then ill either take 1 massive ( you know what) or it will be more watery/not a very fulfilling BM, i'll get sad/unhappy and see what happens next.I look bloated 24/7 and im always miserable, ive contemplated suicide and i just cant take it, im single and i dont have any kids, which in a way helps since when i need to take a dump, i have very few distractions that keep me from the bathroom, i also make sure its at night= more time to 'go'I do not have a doctor and i haven't since i was 18, so i have NO IDEA whats wrong with my colon/stomach, other than im always constipated, obviously i know theirs a problem, ive never had my stomach x-rayed from sheer embarrassment/fear, but i also ask myself, ive had this problem for years, if it was a bowel impacment, wouldn't it by now have killed me? or come out piece by piece? I can't relate my problem to any female specifics like a period or anything of that nature since im a male, oh and i'm not on ANY medication for anything, since some people get constipated as a side effect, i'm on NOTHING, other than ex lax.I don't drink water cause i hate it/choke on it and my diets very well, average i'd say, i do eat dairy( cheese, milk) and just regular food, bread, chicken, steak, beans, eggs, you get the idea. I'm not vegan and I'm not on any diet, i don't take laxatives to lose weight, i take them to shit. I don't have any specific questions but i'll answer ANYTHING, i guess 1 point i wanna make is taking higher than the recommended dosage of Ex Lax will NOT kill you/poison you, ive taken all 24 hundreds of times and other than a SEVERE agonizing stomach ache, you will be fine, and hopefully it ends with a clean colon!Thanks for reading, it was very difficult to admit all this.",2,1750480561.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

Most people move to the burbs cause they want to escape the hustle and bustle, safety, etc - but they wanna spend their free time in the ""downtown"" area of the nearest local suburb (""downtown"" in this case means like one single street that's a 5 block stretch of restaurants, bars, coffee shops- slightly walkable but just barely). The suburb I'm from has been talking about this ""new and exciting development"" in the downtown area for literally 15 years now. And as of today, it is only about 75% done!! And I swear to god, the way my family talks about this development of like a single outdoor concert park, two rooftop bars, a movie theatre, and maybe one new local coffee shop- you would think this is the second coming of Jesus Christ himself.

1lgnylm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1lgnylm/did_i_ruin_it/,Did I ruin it?,"I could really use some advice! 
So we’ve been in a relationship for three years now, living together pretty much all this time. We met in a coffee event, become friends and then I asked him out a few months later and we started dating. In general we have small issues but overall we work amazingly. I love him so so so much and feel the same from his side as well. Before meeting me he didn’t have a lot of sexual experience. I literally taught him to kiss and our sex improved over time and now it’s amazing.

The only issue that came was libido difference. I’ve a higher libido, he doesn’t (will discuss more on that later). Like 2 years ago he started having anxiety issues coz of his work and started taking medication. That drastically impacted his libido. Post that we were having sex like once in a month or two. It impacted me. 3 months ago I discussed his thoughts on open relationship. Thought it would put less pressure on him and he can explore things. We agreed to it. There were not many rules but love and respect each other, keep us as priorities and tell each other about whoever you meet. We started it with a threesome to get both on board and it went great. 

We both met people and told right before or after what happened. I started traveling to meet family like 3 weeks ago. Slowly two things happened- 1. The excitement he had was new to me. 2. I found my struggle and insecurity, kinda rediscovered it (more on this later). I shared these issues with him over video call, and I felt I was not well heard. After this we didn’t talk, he started kinda avoiding my text, like no reply all day long. This got me anxious. I was on a trip with my parents and couldn’t have a proper conversation. I told him I’m not doing good with this open relationship. I’ve got anxiety with this and I feel bad. I told him I’m not the space to talk properly right now. I told him the date (6 days from then) when I can discuss as I’ll be back at home (still long distance). After 6 days he told he met a bunch of people in those 6 days. Didn’t tell me coz it’ll hurt me knowing I’ve shared my issues. Later he admitted he knew I was not doing okay and feared that I’ll close the relation, so didn’t tell me and avoided me. He was aware that this will hurt me, but didn’t know by how much. 

- About hurt. It hurt me very badly that he ignored my feelings. He didn’t put me as priority. I love his so so much, but feel like his excitement and desperation got more priority than me not being hurt, or my emotional issues. This killed me a little from inside.  

- About the insecurity! I’m brown, good shape, good down there but my face faces a lot of rejections. I completely forgot about it as I didn’t deal with it in 3 years. He says I’m beautiful pretty much every day from past 3 years. I forgot how trying hookups made me feel insecure and ugly a bit. I’ve met people and had good times but it comes at the cost of me spending a lot of time and mental energy. On the other hand, he was a sexy bottom, Korean, and was about to score them easily. I really don’t wanna struggle to make ends meet in a relationship every now and then.

- Limerence. I’m aware of the new energy. For majority of our relation there was libido difference. Not sure what changed after opening it. We have great sex but still haven’t explored enough or had enough experience for a 3 year relation. It has been less frequent. Btw he loves our sex too. We both are pretty open to try things.

- We haven’t decided anything but he said he likes the open relation and wants to keep it that way. I’ve shared my issues and I’m not sure about his priority. He already made a decision once by not telling me which was not in my favour. I can try things, explore but don’t wanna struggle. If I get into it, I don’t think I’ll be able to have similar experiences. Even when I do, it might consume me a bit. In this recent experience, I feel tired finding people and was not very fun and the insecurity got me. I know it’s wrong to feel but it feels sad that he gets to explore and I’ll struggle. Obviously his exploring will affect my sexual relation with him. Only limited times a person can have sex. 

- I love him so much and really don’t wanna lose him. I give a lot in the relation and I’m fear I’ll be suffering a lot as well. I give importance to my partner, family, love, friends more than anything. I’m happy to work things out, but I’m not sure how much it’ll take from me. I want to build a life, have kids, travel.

Did I ruin everything by proposing an open relationship? Is there anything I can do to make it right or keep the relationship? I’m not against open relationship but could it be that I’m ugly for one?

A short story,"This story begins with me (25m) and my father going out on the lake to fish some bluegill. How silly I was to assume that this would end in any ordinary fashion. Upon arrival, it was cloudy out but warm. The forecast was almost inviting me to take my shirt off and bare my pasty back as my initiation into the realm of the tan. I accepted the invitation thinking, ""i gotta burn first to get a tan."" This was tested and true logic. No reason to second guess. I noticed about an hour in the clouds seemed to be parting around the small lake we were fishing. All around it was stormy, but it had seemed God was blessing me with all of these beautiful rays aallllll to myself. Poor, unassuming me took the bait and rolled with it. Leaving, I noticed my deep sunburn. I'd been burned to shit as a kid. Never had an issue. Same old bubbling, flaking, itching. I thought, easy peasy... and so worth the tan, right? That night I was EXHAUSTED. The sun really did a number on me, I thought. Little did I know. That night I became ill. Full blown flu like symptoms rattled my poor lobster colored, clammy body. I looked it up and the meds I'm on were the culprit of my sun sensitivity. I went to bed and woke up feeling tired still, but no longer sick. Great! I thought. It's all over.... the next day I pushed through the pain and fatigue to get my exercise in. Went running, but didnt make it far. Then later played a round of intense pickleball... in the beating sun. Went to bed tired, but just fine. The next day I decide to Rollerblade around town a bit instead of run. Got a lil sweaty. Came back and took a shower and felt so good. Okay, I thought. This is the end of my fight with this pesky sunburn. That night I'm sitting in my living room. Watching TV and practicing my aim with my blowgun. Great shot, I thought. What a fun night I'm having, I thought. I'm about to wrap up the night when suddenly... I feel tingly. I'm thinking, yeah I remember it getting itchy before peeling before. Must be dry skin. Faster than you can say supercalafragalisticexpialadocious, it struck. DUN DUN DUN. I'm itchy. Oh IM REALLY FU**ING ITCHY. OH MY GOD WHAT DO I DO!? at this point I'm skating through the rooms of my apartment like a dog when it gets the zoomies. But there was no joy in these zoomies. Only pain. I reach for aloe. Spread it all over. FU*K! THATS WORSE! okay, I know! Lotion! FU*K! THATS EVEN WORSE! I'm panicking. Thoughts of how I can end this sneaky onset of the most hellish conditions flood my mind. I'm gonna jump! I'm gonna sprint into the road. I'm gonna call 911! No no no. SHOWER! GET IN THE SHOWER! My last ditch effort. Here goes nothing. RELIEF! Oh sweet relief. It was like I had seen war in its rarest form and finally came home to a land of milk and honey. My eyes rolled back. I sat in the shower to collect myself. At this point, it's 12 am and I managed to get two zyrtec in me during my zoomies. I'm falling asleep in the shower and I become fearful of running out of hot water. I try to venture out. Surely that was the brunt of it. Surely the shower cured me. Oh contrair. Just as frantic as before (maybe even more) I find myself collecting my phone and darting for another shower. I'm in the shower. In tears. Insanity. PURE DELIRIOUS INSANITY. I call my father, and plead. ""I know i sound crazy but I can't stop itching and I can't leave the shower. Please help. (I wasn't going to call the ambulance quite yet because I live in America and..  you get it). My dad's on the way. Here i am. Naked.. in a puddle of my own tears and lukewarm shower water at best. I take a moment to soak in my life as it is. For a second I giggled. I found the most peace I've felt in years. And I mean peace like a psychedelic breakthrough type of peace. I accepted my fate. My reality was pure suffering in that moment and somehow it brought me to the innermost piece of the universe. (Yes I know this sounds nuts). I fell into a meditative state. The only way i could find peace was through this centered place that I sometimes have a hard time reaching on any other day. This was not just any other day. My father arrives. I'm in the shower, feeling like I was just fed my first meal in years. The meal being the hot water and my mouth being my singed back side. Eating away at this godly blessing. He timidly introduces his presence and I respond with. hello? He notices I'm not at all like I was on the phone.. says I'm here. I brought hydrocortisone. I peek out and say ok.. give me a minute. I soak in the last few seconds of my little slice of heaven. Stepping out, I instantly start to tingle. I'm trying to ignore it. It's not real, it's over. I'm better now. I've found God lmfao. I sit down, he says OK I'm gonna out this on your back. Instantly I RUN. NOPE NOPE NOPE I GOTTA GO. back to my watery cave I go. Under the water, I can think enough to explain to my father what I'm experiencing. I perused reddit a little earlier in the shower and was able to find the name hells itch. I vaguely remembering s friend mentioning it to me the day after I got burnt. Never thought much of it. Not it's all I can think of. Hours of showering have gone by, I tell my dad I'm gonna get out. I'm timid. Afraid to move too much. I waddle my way to the couch. My loin is clothed. Nothing else. By this point my bathroom is soaking wet.. and now my couch as well. The zyrtec is begging me to sleep... my back is begging me to suffer in excruciating pain.  I'm able to get to a meditative stage on the couch again. So long as my father didn't speak to me, because a thought... yes even a thiught... would flare my sh*t up once again. I Must stay strong. I Must survive this. Okay. I'm gonna lay down. I'm sitting there twitching, crying, moaning in pain and discomfort. All I can feel is my nerve endings attempting to resurrect themselves. A riteous fight, I had no way of stopping. Onward, I thought. This is your life now, I thought. At some point around 3 or 4 am, my father offers me a cold towel for my back. I'm afraid it'll flare me up again. YIKES THAT HURTS. I'm paralyzed in pain. I can't communicate to my father what I'm feeling.. nothing but grunts and tears. I finally am able to snap enough to reach back and throw the towel off of me. (Thank you to my father for being there by me BTW. Shouts out to him.) I say, I cant do it. He's wondering, what could he mean by that. I don't really know what i meant. But that's how I felt. I'm strong, but am I this strong? Will i survive this? I'm able to tough out my next 2 or 3 hours. Eventually, I'm staring at my phone and the sun is coming up. Hell's itch has no time for sleep. Not in my house, says hell's itch. I concur. At some point mid morning, the right side of my back stops spasming every second and regresses to once every 10 or so second give or take. That's a victory for me. I lay strategically. I can see the finish line. Finally.. I fall asleep. I awaken some time around noon. In a depressed, anxious state. I'm on edge. I feel the enemy is near. I can smell hell's itch in the air. Waiting to pop out around the corner at any time. Here i go. Timidly, I sit up. Move toward the piss pot and awkwardly walk past my dad as if we didn't just share the weirdest, most alarming experience just hours before. Well. Time for coffee? Sounds good to me.

This is the first time I'm interacting with this subreddit and I'm extremely new to tea and so I'm looking for some recommendations. 

I'm thinking of having a cup of warm tea to journal with, have a walk afterwards to release my emotions, and go to bed relaxed. Hence I need something hot, won't disrupt my sleep too much, not too sweet, definitely not bitter, but i'd like a flavour which is not too subtle. I don't want to have to focus my mind 100% on the tea to actually taste it. I don't mind if it takes some time to brew, but I only have a french press for coffee. If I need any other equipment for your tea suggestions do let me know, thanks. ",6,1750479663.0,tea,13,1.0,False

I had my sleeve surgery in April 2023. Starting weight was 168 kg, dropped to 112 kg at my lowest, and now I’m back up to 124 kg. I’ve been struggling with food intolerances and some regain over the past year.

Now my doctor is suggesting Mini Gastric Bypass (MGB/OAGB). I’m seriously considering it — not just for long-term weight loss, but because I might need to donate part of my liver to my father around 5–6 months from now. Reaching 90–95 kg would qualify me as a backup option if a cadaver liver isn’t available in time. So this surgery is a backup plan for a much bigger reason.

That said, I’m really concerned about the increase in food intolerances. After the sleeve I already developed:
	•	Coffee causing throat irritation and stomach issues
	•	Jaggery causing gas
	•	Cow milk intolerance (buffalo milk is okay)
	•	White rice makes me sluggish, but puffed rice is fine
	•	Sugar and oily foods make me feel very sleepy or sick

I’ve already done a food intolerance panel and made a lot of changes to my diet. But I’m worried that MGB will make things harder — fewer safe foods, more digestive issues, and no room for the little things I enjoy (like my morning coffee).

For anyone who’s gone from sleeve to MGB:
	•	Did your intolerances get worse?
	•	Were there foods you could eat after the sleeve but not after MGB?
	•	Was it worth it for you in the long run?
	•	Were you able to reintroduce coffee or anything important to your routine?

Appreciate any honest insights or personal experience.
