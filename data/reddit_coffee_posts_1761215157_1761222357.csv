i gave her the drink and i had a line of other drinks needed to be made. she asks me why it's sweet, so i told her it has a syrup in it. and she said that's not what she ordered, so i said the drink she ordered comes with the syrup by default. i felt like i seemed rude but i had a back order of drinks to make, and there were more people ordering. 

the owner went to her and offered to remake the drink (aka giving me the task of remaking). owners being owners. i disagreed with this move since we were already in a shortage of ingredients, had a massive line of people waiting, and i was making drinks non stop for 3 hours at that point. my opinion, if you're unsure about a drink you should always ask at the till what it is. don't like it? not my fault you decided to be adventurous. it's not even that i made the the drink wrong, it just wasn't her preference which is out of my control ",1,1761222210.0,barista,1,1.0,False

Countless late nights fueled by coffee, watching my savings dwindle while trying to pay for ads, only to discover that the shiny new features I launched barely made a dent. It often feels like I'm building in a vacuum, throwing stones into the dark with no echo, no feedback, nothing. Users sign up but rarely stick around. Am I building a real business or just chasing a shiny toy?

I see other founders push out updates and videos faster, sometimes louder, than I can blink. It's disheartening and makes me question if I'm cut out for this world. Then there's HypeCaster. I've heard about its automated video creation and how it can help maintain content consistency, making me question if that's where I'm lacking. Could it be the solution I've been overlooking?

But doubts linger. Is this just me looking for an easy button, or is it a genuine opportunity to break through the noise? This constant swing between feeling discouraged and holding onto a glimmer of hope is exhausting. Yet, I can't shake off the belief that this project can work.

And every December, I hit the same wall: I breeze through the first few days… then the puzzles get hard. Really hard. The kind of hard that has you staring into space, wondering if writing code was a good life choice.

This year, I decided: *Enough*.

Instead of grinding through problems myself, I wanted to pull an AlphaGo — build an AI “agent” that could read the problem, plan out a solution, write the code, run it, fix mistakes, and keep going until it nailed the final answer.

My contribution? Make coffee, sit back, and watch the stars roll in.

# The Core Idea

I combined a large language model (Qwen3’s newest max model) with a stateful Jupyter Python runtime, all orchestrated through Autogen’s docker-jupyter-executor. That gave my AI not only the ability to understand problems and generate code, but also to run and test that code step-by-step — just like a real developer would in Jupyter.

Why does that matter? Most AI code-generation setups try to write the entire solution in one go. If there’s a bug or logic issue, it has to regenerate everything from scratch. 

https://preview.redd.it/onp21o9xpuwf1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f84efc9f021615d2da5de7d56fcdc9912d0de0

My approach lets the AI be iterative:

1. Read the problem.
2. Write a small piece of code.
3. Run it.
4. Observe the results.
5. Adjust and continue.

https://preview.redd.it/azshs6t0quwf1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=207d39e36e957abd9a6610b543934374fd2cdae1

It’s basically the ReAct pattern (think “Think → Act → Observe → Repeat”) fused with the interactivity of Jupyter.

# The Results

I tested my agent on past AoC challenges before the event even started. It was solving puzzles so fast that I barely had time to understand the question before it spat out the answer. I wasn’t the bottleneck anymore — the AI was.

https://preview.redd.it/2p4szdl4quwf1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f05fd79c8d3453fd96e554880536e392c8d1e4b

I even added support for multi-turn conversations, so tackling the infamous “Part Two” of each daily puzzle is seamless. You can feed in extra inputs or clarifications, and it just keeps working.

https://i.redd.it/3xpusty5quwf1.gif

Honestly? The moment I saw it rack up 47 stars on my test run, faster than I’d ever managed manually, I knew this was game-changing.

# Beyond Advent of Code

The setup isn’t limited to AoC. Because it can read files, plan step-by-step, and keep state across executions, it’s equally at home doing data analysis, anomaly detection, or any task where you’d normally need an interactive coding environment.

I’ve already run it on transaction anomaly detection workflows — same agent, same process, just a different dataset.

https://i.redd.it/1ib4aafaquwf1.gif

# Why I’m Excited

This isn’t about “AI replacing developers.” It’s about extending what we can do. Jupyter has always felt like the perfect playground for experimentation and iterative problem-solving. Marrying that to an LLM’s reasoning ability through Autogen turns it into something that feels almost collaborative.

The agent thinks in small steps, checks its own work, learns from mistakes in real-time, and carries the context forward to the next step. It’s the closest I’ve seen an AI come to how humans actually problem-solve when coding.

# If You’re Curious

In my full write-up, I break down exactly how I wired this together: Docker container setup, using Autogen tools, designing prompts to get the agent thinking iteratively, and building a Chainlit UI so anyone can use it without touching code.

1oe1cxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oe1cxa/i_saw_my_ex_last_night_after_almost_2_months_no/,I saw my ex last night after almost 2 months no contact.,"To explain - I work for a school & ordered books online through this place that sends children’s books. My books came to my old address & my ex had texted me to see if I wanted to come pick up the books or if my ex could drop them off. 

We hadn’t spoken since the end of August & had unfollowed each other on social media. I unfollowed first because it was definitely what I needed. But since I’d finally be seeing her, I didn’t want to miss the chance to extend the meeting. I asked if she might want to take a walk & we ended up just smoking in my car, driving for food really quick & then back at her apartment (our old apartment together) to watch a little bit on the TV. So many emotions have gone through me since last night. I’d say our situation & break up was a little unique. My ex’s reasonings for the breakup was she just wanted to figure herself out & get herself together & focus on her family. She didn’t want me to feel left out or “single” while being in the relationship. This is something that I’ve still been battling with & confused over. We were together nearly 4 years, so it’s been hard for me to grasp her reasoning. When we ended she’d told me she’d come back for me, but now that I was seeing her in person again I had to see how she felt. She told me that, speaking for how she felt in the moment, that she would’ve reached out to me at some point even if she didn’t get the items in the mail to give to me. I’ve been moved out of the apartment for about 4 months now & we’ve been broken up for a little over 6 months. I still struggle with the, “Would we ever be good for each other?” “Were we even compatible?” “Should I just let it go & never want her to come back?” Maybe more time would make these questions go away, maybe not. But after I got home, my ex had texted me to see if I might want to get coffee in a few weeks bc my birthday is coming up. I’d been telling her not to reach out unless she wanted to talk about the relationship or talk about getting back together. She told me there’s been times where she wanted to but she thought that I was meaning get back together right away. I told her that the process would be very very slow, for the both of us, if we ever did try again. I think that’s one of the reasons we might not have worked the first time around. We dove right in & were roommates after 2 months together. We never actually took things slowly. I’ll probably end up going for coffee. Who knows. But I just had to come on here & share after last night

1oe1cbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1oe1cbf/a_pace_calculator_that_hopefully_doesnt_suck/,A pace calculator that (hopefully) doesn’t suck,"Hey guys, I built a pace calculator that does not suck. Not that they all suck, but I wanted one that fits what I want from the pace calculator. 

**What it does (core):**

* Pick a distance and a goal time → it shows the pace.
* Start with a pace → it shows the finish time.
* Enter any two of time / pace / distance → it gives you the third. Simple, fast, no account. Made to be obvious on a phone when your brain is tired.
* Also have weight adjustment calculator - for others like me who like to dream about ""what if i drop 10 kg, how much faster I will be""

**Also have major marathon specific calculators – could be handy for next week NYC marathon:**

* Choose a pacing template (even or gentle negative).
* Adjust a few course sections (early, middle, late) so it matches how you race NYC, not a generic chart.
* Download pace band that you can print.

I’m not selling anything. I just want something runners actually use. Calculator is free, all is free. No ads. There is some ""but me coffee"" kinda link buried in few places, tho.

**Feedback I’m looking for – because this is the first iteration that probably not great yet.**

1. **Flow:** From first tap to result, does it feel obvious? Where do you hesitate?
2. **Language:** Are the labels plain enough (goal time, pace, split)?
3. **Defaults:** Would you want common race presets (5K/10K/HM/M) right at the top?
4. **Clarity:** Is the screen calm enough to read when you’re rushed? What would you remove to make it clearer?
5. **P**ace band on ""Marathon pages"" - is it clear what it is and what is the value?

Thanks for reading. Brutal honesty welcome I’ll iterate quickly.

1oe1b5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NobaraProject/comments/1oe1b5x/i_have_problem_installing_nobara_and_i_think_i/,"I have problem installing Nobara, and I think i fucked up my system too. PLEASE PLEASE Help. [HELP]","Hello everyone. I want to use Nobara for everything, and windows for some spesific things i cant replace. I tried dual booting, but after a series of events, i think i fucked up majorly. I will explain everything below, please be kind, i have very few knowlege in coding and anything related. 

My system : Asus Rog Zephyrus

\-> Intel i7-950H 2.60GHz  
\-> 2 SSDs 512GB  
\-> NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070.  
\-> Intergrated graphics from intel 630, this becomes relevant later  
\->32gb Ram  
\-> KDE Plasma for nobara

  
Now, lets get to it. I used some help from chatgpt and yt videos because i didnt know how to proceed, thats probably where the fuckening happenend.

I had my system running on Windows 10. I wiped it out, i used the reset feature from windows, and did a complete reset, files programms everything. I re installed windows on my C drive. They work fine all is good, thats where im posting from. Now, i wanted to install Nobara on my D drive.

I made a partition on my D drive, dont ask me why i didnt use the whole thing, i was stupid. I booted Nobara from my usb and went ahead with the install.  I also configured grub so when i boot, i have the option to choose which operating system i want to use, so far so good.

I log in to Nobara. It is VERY laggy and has  ""fps drops"" even when trying to navigate a folder. This is where it all goes downhill. 

I downloaded my drivers and everything, activated NVIDIA, nothing. Still slow af. I asked chatgpt. After a long while of reinstalling the drivers through the terminal, i rebooted, still slow. 

I typed   
\-> nvidia-smi   
\-> lspci -k | grep -EA3 'VGA|3D|Display'

to the terminal to see whats up. These were the results. 

\--------------------------------------------  
1)   NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.

2)   0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation CoffeeLake-H GT2 \[UHD Graphics 630\] (rev 02) DeviceName: Second VGA Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 1891 Kernel driver in use: i915 Kernel modules: i915 --

nouveau 0000:01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation TU106 High Definition Audio Controller (rev a1)

\----------------------------------------  
  
Chatgpt then told me this : 

* ✅ The NVIDIA packages *are* installed (that’s good).
* ❌ But the driver itself is **not loaded**. Your system is still using the Intel iGPU (`i915`) and keeping the NVIDIA card bound to the open-source `nouveau` module — which blocks the proprietary driver from loading.
* ⚠️ `prime-select` isn’t available on Nobara, so we’ll handle GPU switching differently.

It said i have to block nouveau and gave me a code, i proceeded with the code below 

sudo bash -c 'echo ""blacklist nouveau"" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf'

sudo bash -c 'echo ""options nouveau modeset=0"" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf'

sudo dracut --force

sudo reboot

\--- AFTER REBOOT ---

lsmod | grep nouveau

\------------------------------------------  


After a while of back and forth with some stuff failing and some others not, chat found out that my current kernel version, the newest Nobara (6.17.3-201.nobara.fc42.x86\_64), isnt compatible with my graphics card yet. So i went back and used the previous one that was compatible (6.16.9.200). This took sm back and forth.  After all that, i run nvidia-smi once more.

\+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 580.95.05 Driver Version: 580.95.05 CUDA Version: 13.0 | +-----------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

So my NVIDIA was recognized. 

My system was still slow. It was set to performance in the power settings so it wasnt that. I run in the terminal ***glxinfo | grep ""OpenGL renderer""*** to see whats up. The result?

***OpenGL renderer string: Mesa Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 (CFL GT2)***

It was still using intergrated graphics.

I tried to make nvidia default with prime (***\_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD***), it didnt work, then found out that prime doesnt work with this version for some reasson, so i tried using  ***swichero***.

  
I tried installing the swichero utilities, then chatgpt told me to create a ***Xorg configuration for NVIDIA.***  


***After all of that and a reboot, it still showed that it used intel on the  ""glxinfo | grep ""OpenGL renderer"".***  


Some time later, after trying stuff, i found out im using ***wayland***, and apparently if i used ***x11*** it would be much better for NVIDIA. So, thats what i tried to do with chat gpt.

It told me to log out and swich to x11, thre should be a gear in the log in screen, there was nothing. Then it said that must be because ***""Nobara’s display manager is hiding the session type selector by default"" ,*** so it gave me some code to fix it. I dit and rebooted.

***This is where the fuckening started.***

Right after choosing the nobara os , the system is stuck on a black screen saying ""24.2261841 Disabling IRQ #16"" and it won't continue to let me log on.  When i logged in nobara previous time, it was still there but said mor things and it was only for a second, then proceeded to go to grub menu. Not this time.

Long story short, it gets me to grub, then i press edit on the Nobara installation, add some code trying to fix the whole "" 24.2261841 Disabling IRQ #16 - AKA one hardware device stopped responding properly"" issue and reboot.

Now grub wont work. It wont let me choose an OS, it wont let me go to bios, nothing. It give me an error message and then a comand line. 

***After some back and forth with trying to fix that, i gave up. I rebooted, hit ESC repeatedly, logged, finally, into windows and wiped my entire D drive, the one Nobara was installed on, i wanted to restart completly.*** 

So thats what i do.

I wiped my D completely. I re installed Nobara linux on it and hit reboot. Now when I open my laptop, I can't even access the grub menu to select an os.   
There is is brief error message saying : Failed to open \\EFI\\FEDORA\\/RECOVER BCD - Invalid parameter Failed to load image : invalid parameter start\_image() returned Invalid parameter , falling back to default loader   
And then after this I am met with this screen where it prompts me to type stuff, the same one i was met with before.

Chat said i need to do some stuff with the coding side, i did, nothing, Now i am trying to reinstall Nobara AGAIN in hopes it will fix it. 

BUT WAIT, THERES MORE

Not only when i start my laptop now it gont get me to Grub menu (i have to press ESC to get to the os list, not even bios), it wont let me even install Nobara!

This is how i did my partitions, My root,home and EFI.

And then while installing, it gave me this

==================================

So here i am now. When i open my system , i am met with the grub menu error/ command line, unless i spam ESC to let me choose an OS/Boot device. I log to my USB, try to install nobara on my D and this happens. Please help me. Thank you to all who read so far.

Finally, my resume is being seen by real people! Sharing my experience with everyone.

First, I proactively look up the hiring manager or team leader on LinkedIn and send a short email within an hour of seeing the position. I'll reference a specific task from the job description and a matching line from my resume. I'll then ask if the position is still open and if a three-point summary would help them with the process. Keeping the email to four sentences or fewer makes it easier to get a response.

Second, I set up Google Alerts. One (from other posts) features the specific position at the target company, another features the company name + ""hiring"" + location, and another features my own work.

Third, I track all this info like a mini-pipeline. I keep a simple Notion page with sections for company, contact information, date, and next steps. The next day, I'll follow up with valuable content (like a short portfolio snippet or an idea about their product). If I don't see any progress by the fifth day, I'll move on and stop dwelling on it.

Regarding the resume gap: Start lying. Tell them what they want to hear. Summarize it in one sentence, then say another sentence to show I'm up to date, and then move on to value. For example: I spent 6 months independently improving my SQL and Power BI skills; I rebuilt two dashboards for a nonprofit, and now I'm ready to bring these skills to an internal analytics position.

In interview prep, consciously record your speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Beyz interview assistant and I recorded several 90-second clips and realized I habitually say ""sry"" and filler words. Unnecessary pauses and interjections also need to be aware.

For most of us, coffee isn’t just a drink—it’s a ritual, a morning reset, and sometimes the only thing that gets us moving.  
But when it comes to buying a coffee maker, things can get *overwhelming*. Between espresso machines, drip brewers, and pod systems, choosing the right one can feel like decoding a secret coffee language.

You might wonder: *Do I need a machine that grinds beans? Should I go for a smart coffee maker? Is it worth spending extra for better flavor?*

Don’t worry—this guide breaks it all down for you. Whether you’re a casual drinker or a home barista in training, we’ve tested, researched, and compared the **best coffee makers of 2025** so you can find your perfect match—without the guesswork.



# 🧠 Before You Buy: What to Know Before Choosing a Coffee Maker

Buying a coffee machine isn’t just about picking the most expensive or prettiest model. It’s about matching the machine’s strengths with your brewing habits, taste preferences, and lifestyle.



# 1. Different Types of Coffee Makers

**Drip Coffee Makers:**  
Ideal for families or offices. They brew multiple cups at once, and modern models feature smart timers and brew-strength controls.

**Single-Serve (Pod) Machines:**  
Perfect for those who want a quick cup with minimal cleanup. Compatible with pods like Keurig or Nespresso, they offer convenience but often cost more per cup.

**Espresso Machines:**  
For true coffee purists. They deliver rich, crema-topped espresso shots. Semi-automatic and super-automatic versions vary in how much control you have.

**French Press & Pour-Over:**  
Manual methods that appeal to flavor-focused drinkers. They take more time but reward you with a nuanced cup.

**Grind-and-Brew Machines:**  
These combine a coffee grinder and brewer in one—ideal for those who crave freshly ground beans every time.



# 2. Material and Build Quality

A good coffee maker should feel *solid*. Stainless steel models not only look sleek but also last longer and resist heat damage. Plastic parts are fine for budget models but tend to wear down over time, especially near heating elements.

Look for models with **BPA-free components**, a **stainless-steel carafe**, and **reliable heating systems** that maintain water temperature between *195–205°F*—the sweet spot for optimal extraction.



# 3. Ease of Use vs Performance

There’s a trade-off between control and convenience.

* **Manual brewers** (like French press or espresso) offer superior taste but require more effort.
* **Automatic machines** are effortless but limit customization.

Ask yourself: *Do I enjoy the ritual of brewing, or do I just want caffeine on demand?*



# 4. Price vs Value

A $300 espresso machine might sound like a luxury, but if it replaces your $6 daily coffee shop habit, it pays for itself fast. Conversely, don’t overspend on features you’ll never use—like a built-in milk frother if you only drink black coffee.

The key: focus on **long-term durability** and **consistent performance**, not just fancy extras.

# ❓ FAQs About Coffee Makers

**Q1. How often should I clean my coffee maker?**  
Ideally, after every use for removable parts, and a full descaling every 1–2 months depending on your water quality.

**Q2. Do expensive coffee makers really make better coffee?**  
Often, yes—because they maintain consistent brewing temperatures and extraction times. But technique and coffee quality matter just as much.

**Q3. What’s better: a pod machine or a traditional brewer?**  
Pods win for speed and convenience; traditional brewers win for flavor and flexibility.

**Q4. How long does a good coffee maker last?**  
With regular maintenance, 5–10 years is common for quality brands like Breville or Technivorm.

2. Grace was from the beginning, no new type of grace
3. The grace through Jesus is life blood cleansing for those who repent, obey all, follow and know him!
4. Once saved always saved is a lie.
5. We must imitate Christ. Eat clean and observe the festivals stay away from oagan holidays.
6. Don't mix the unclean with the clean

And every December, I hit the same wall: I breeze through the first few days… then the puzzles get hard. Really hard. The kind of hard that has you staring into space wondering if writing code was a good life choice.

This year, I decided: *Enough*.

Instead of grinding through problems myself, I wanted to pull an AlphaGo — build an AI “agent” that could read the problem, plan out a solution, write the code, run it, fix mistakes, and keep going until it nailed the final answer.

My contribution? Make coffee, sit back, and watch the stars roll in.

# The Core Idea

I combined a large language model (Qwen3’s newest max model) with a stateful Jupyter Python runtime, all orchestrated through Autogen’s `docker-jupyter-executor`. That gave my AI not only the ability to understand problems and generate code, but also to run and test that code step-by-step — just like a real developer would in Jupyter.

Why does that matter? Most AI code-generation setups try to write the entire solution in one go. If there’s a bug or logic issue, it has to regenerate everything from scratch. My approach lets the AI be iterative:

1. Read the problem.
2. Write a small piece of code.
3. Run it.
4. Observe the results.
5. Adjust and continue.

It’s basically the ReAct pattern (think “Think → Act → Observe → Repeat”) fused with the interactivity of Jupyter.

# The Results

I tested my agent on past AoC challenges before the event even started. It was solving puzzles so fast that I barely had time to understand the question before it spat out the answer. I wasn’t the bottleneck anymore — the AI was.

I even added support for multi-turn conversations, so tackling the infamous “Part Two” of each daily puzzle is seamless. You can feed in extra inputs or clarifications, and it just keeps working.

Honestly? The moment I saw it rack up 47 stars on my test run, faster than I’d ever managed manually, I knew this was game-changing.

# Beyond Advent of Code

The setup isn’t limited to AoC. Because it can read files, plan step-by-step, and keep state across executions, it’s equally at home doing data analysis, anomaly detection, or any task where you’d normally need an interactive coding environment.

I’ve already run it on transaction anomaly detection workflows — same agent, same process, just a different dataset.

# Why I’m Excited

This isn’t about “AI replacing developers.” It’s about extending what we can do. Jupyter has always felt like the perfect playground for experimentation and iterative problem-solving. Marrying that to an LLM’s reasoning ability through Autogen turns it into something that feels almost collaborative.

The agent thinks in small steps, checks its own work, learns from mistakes in real-time, and carries the context forward to the next step. It’s the closest I’ve seen an AI come to how humans actually problem-solve when coding.

# If You’re Curious

In my full write-up, I break down exactly how I wired this together: Docker container setup, using Autogen tools, designing prompts to get the agent thinking iteratively, and building a Chainlit UI so anyone can use it without touching code.

If you’ve ever wanted an AI coding buddy that can tackle not just AoC but any gnarly problem you throw at it — and do it in a way that’s surprisingly human-like — you’ll want to read my full story.",1,1761220321.0,AI_Agents,2,1.0,False

I'm seriously considering opening a small coffee shop in  Sousse, Tunisia, and could really use some practical advice from those in the industry. I'm a complete beginner, so please be blunt with your insights.

My Situation:

* **Location:** Khezema, Sousse. I own the commercial space (so no rent!).
* **Space:**  around  30 square meters.
* **Traffic:** The neighborhood has good foot and car traffic.
* **Experience:** Zero. I'm eager to learn but starting from scratch.
* **Capital:** I have some savings, but it's not a huge amount. I need to be smart with my budget.

My Big Dilemma:

I can't decide whether to make it a **convenience-style** coffee shop (quick, grab-and-go, simple menu) or a **destination-style** one (cozy, unique vibe, where people stay longer). Given the location and my limited capital, which direction do you think has a better chance of success?

My Main Questions:

1. Startup Costs: For a 30m² space, what's a rough estimate for renovation (basic plumbing, electricity, flooring, painting) and essential equipment (espresso machine, grinder, fridge, furniture etc. ) for a *decent but not luxury* setup in Tunisia?
2. Monthly Running Costs: Besides my own living costs, what should I budget for monthly expenses? ( Utilities, coffee beans, milk, syrups, snacks, cleaning supplies, marketing).
3. Financial Reality Check: With no rent to pay, what kind of daily sales would I need to achieve to break even and then make a modest profit?
4. First-Step Advice: If you were in my shoes, what would be the very first thing you would do?

I have a concept in mind, but I need to ground it in financial reality. Any ballpark figures, warnings, or encouragement from the Tunisian food and beverage  community would be incredibly helpful.

Right now I have access to a drip coffee maker, an AeroPress, and a moka pot. Ideally, I’d like a grinder that can handle both regular coffee and espresso-level grinds (for when I eventually upgrade my setup).

Since I'm still a noobie, I'm wondering if there's any quality, long lasting grinders around $50 before I upgrade. However, I would be willing to go up to $200 if it's truly justified.

I’d also prefer something that’s easy to maintain and clean.

In my defense, it’s bern a busy complicated health year. I’m a 59F treating for very early breast cancer, had pelvic surgical procedure two weeks ago to evaluate for more cancer (none detected) and I have hypermobile EDS (connective tissue defect). Because it’s also the midst of college application season I didn’t stop to do much research on Reclast. I have no idea why I felt so confident going into this because usually I’m more hesitant and I research a whole lot. I guess all the cancer docs are really pushing me to start the AI drugs, which rapidly deplete bones, so a whole lot of pressure from many

I’ve been off supplements and vitamins as I’ve had a couple surgeries and radiation therapy for cancer, so rather than start and stop for treatments, I just stopped all my nutritional supplements for the treatment period. 

Nevertheless 11.5 hours prior ChatGPT suggests so supplemental Vitamin D, like maybe 2000-5000. Since it’s after midnight and the bottle of 10,000 iu is on the table, I took that. Then I figured a “loading dose” might be better because I’ve been told to do that in the past when low, take weekly vs daily. In my defense, it was after midnight and I was exhausted. So I took 50,000 iu. Then in the morning I took 20,000 iu and afterwards another 20,000 iu. So basically I gave myself multiple boluses of Vitamin D not knowing my current Vitamin D level (I knew it was low, but didn’t know how low yet). Spoiler alert - taking a Vitamin D bolus was NOT a smart move 🤦🏻‍♀️

The vitamin D was in fact a very bad move, very much contraindicated and likely drove a lot of my pain. Drinking coffee before and during my 60-minute infusion, also probably not the best move. Not knowing to ultra hydrate prior and during, also not great.

Infusion was fine, some irritation at vein site on back of hand, but with one arm off limits because of recent node excision, and a recent surgery that used two sites in arm, the hand was the best (only) option for placement.

Everything was fine till about 11-hours later. Then extreme chest wall pain came on pretty quickly within an hour. Worsened to a very high level after midnight. Called on-call hospital doc per instructions. Told to go to ER. Decided to breathe very shallowly and try to sleep, at 3:30-am pain was unbearable and centered in left chest wall. NP had warned about chest wall pain and indicated heart is largest muscle in chest, so if it hurts there, go get assessed. Finally went to ER. Had my paperwork that had a telephone number for the oncall doc, plus instructions for the ionic calcium test. 

Didn’t see an ER doc for 3.5 hours after arrival, he was a DO. He said he’d “looked online” and saw nothing about hearts and Reclast. Was not interested in paperwork from prescribing hospital, refused iconic calcium test even after heart was deemed “okay.” Called PCP, she even tried to get him to order the appropriate test, he still refused. Finally PCP office said they’d schedule it through their office. I could literally walk from the ER to her building down the hall (but I had to wait until next day for blood draw appointment). Went home in pain after refusing morphine and Zofran (don’t tolerate these and not nauseous so didn’t need anti nausea meds). ER Doc said he’d give me toradol instead if not heart or clotting found (none found, still denied, or just forgot about the toradol). By then I just wanted to leave.

The extreme pain persisted mostly on, a little off, for 17-hours. It was very mildly noticeable and sporadic on Day 2. After reading many posts in this group today, I’ll kick up my hydration, get a weighted vest, and restart Vit D (at 2000 iu) and other supplements, plus start weight bearing exercises. 

My NP has been beyond fabulous! She consulted with many docs in her system including the head of endocrinology at Hopkins. The conclusion is that people with Ehlers-Danlos often have chest wall pain with infusion. Hopkins recommends 3-days of oral steroid use prior to infusion to reduce inflammation to help mitigate this chest wall pain. ",3,1761220086.0,osteoporosis,0,1.0,False

when I first happened upon the simpsons I was about 16 years old and working at target @ fairfield , unpacking a new line of t shirts in january of 1990 (or thereabouts im old , senile and crotchety like abe so just run with it) and I beheld bart simpson resplendant in yellow blue and red telling you he was an underachiever and proud of it and also strongly suggesting that you should not have a cow , man . 

I think I was hooked from that moment although also at a phase in development (and post traumatic stress) whereby I trusted no authority figure and was hell bent on just watching the world burn, so I needed further convincing. 

The first season of the simpsons was pure perfection , not in animation perhaps and the voice characterisations were still a work in progress  however the writing and attitude behind the writing is what made me trust , respect and form a deep emotional bond with this magnificent piece of perpetual entertainment, art , social commentary and downright joyful silliness and redonkulousness (its a perfectly cromulent word) 



Now onwards to my real purpose , a defence of the show , and everyone involved in it over the course of its lifetime. Well except for the “golden years” of seasons 1-10 or 1-8 or 1-7 or 1-6 ? , depending on which disgruntled adult writing the click bait article who has become so bitter and jaded they no longer feel joy nor can they suspend belief for the purpose of being entertained . Or the internet expert in all of the comments sections AKA “former fan of the show” who is also an adult now and hasnt realised just how filled with misdirected hate they are and how much rage they have bubbling just below the surface. 

I personally refuse to be an adult most of the time , it sucks and lacks the hilarity and wonderment of embracing the child within. Therein lies the problem that I can see ...while the majority of people grew up with the show they dont feel like the show properly reflects the shitty life they have had to lead since they hit 17/18/19/20 or whatever age it is when adulting became hard (shitty by comparison to what is an unanswerable question , except if you ask it yourself and realise it probably wasnt actually that shitty relative to probably about 60-70% of humans alive today).  

For me the show has always been as close to perfection as is humanly possible and that is definitely not just a blind fool “fanboi” who loves something regardless of a perceived downward turn in quality or direction. One (of the multitude) of reaons the show resonated with me was my already well held belief that any form of entertainment or art is purely judged by an individual , I dont hold any weight with reviews or critics because my only real criteria is DID IT ENTERTAIN OR ART ME ? And if the answer is YES then it is good and im appreciative . 

Are all things equal and as good as each other ? Never …. can there ever be any real purpose to such esoteric comparisons ? Absolutely not , although I acknowledge humans do love a comparison , wish I could figure out why. 

I watch an episode every single day whilst im having breakfast (far better than an apple as I havent had need for a doctor for nigh on 20 years now) and while there is a noted difference in many things the attitude in writing and base level goal of making a laughing stock of the whole human experience and existence in general is as pure as it has ever been and for this every single episode (even the one where grandpa marries selma , what the #$@#$ was that about) had moments of utter perfection (the box fort fight was worth it) and at very least the whole thing was at least played out to as bizarre an end as it began and made me laugh regardless of how far off the page it took me ...and in the many watches since ive found even more to appreciate about it , but thats another rant for another day.

I say unto thee , the simpsons and all its writers and producers and directors and animators and anyone who even brought them coffee deserves your thanks and seasons 1-35 (and all those yet to come) deserve a rewatch with a lighter heart , let it release you from your adultivity and LAUGH like you were 7-13 again. Dont be so cynical and jaded and destroyed by the world , laugh at it with the fresh eyes of the kid inside. 

If not then either A)  come up with something better you lazy sack of peat moss or 3) stop whinging about something you say hasnt been very good for the last 25 or so years and just stop watching it and find something else to love and then hate when you grow up and change . 

This is probably my main point , the simpsons didnt get bad YOU got old and bitter and twisted and jaded (trust me I get it I had a few years of that THEN I GOT OVER MYSELF although I was still able to enjoy the escape my magnificent yellow family brought me ) & now you are a painful pill for the rest of society to swallow , dont take your issues out on the rest of us and just keep your negativity to yourself . 

Now for the final part of my rant , the ones who absolutely drive me to despair for humankind and them specifically , the ones who say it should have been cancelled or they should have quit long ago. Do you realise that is the absolute height of horrible self obsessed narcissism ? Purely because YOU no longer like it anyone who does still enjoy it should be deprived of it based solely on your wishes ? Wow I mean just wow even narcissus would be shocked by your narcissism. You would really deny me and the world robert wagner talking about menopause or gary busey talking about stalking ? Or any one of the other countless moments of pure joy and delight which occurred after you stopped watching for fun and started hate watching with pointless misdirected resentment. 

So you wish to activate some kind of mental dictatorship where only things you like are allowed to be enjoyed ? Well you cannot so find something worth being upset about like the fact that in the time you take to be outraged and upset about things like this a redonkulous number of humans will die from lack of clean drinking water and or food ...yet we produce enough of both basics across the globe to ensure this doesnt have to have happen to anyone ever again …. yet we do not , we bitch and moan about pointless zero world problems. 

My problem with the problem with apu …. its a similar situation to jokes about disabled people or amputees or anyone outstandingly different …. saying you cannot make jokes about them belittles them even more than the actual joke ever could because you are stating that they are so different and removed from society that there is no way they could have a sense of humour about their situation . I concede that mean petty simple and easy jokes at the expense of someones situation is a dicey area . I think you would find as long as its funny and not mean spirited intent then people in whatever situation would get a laugh out of it. 

So was hank azarias accent for apu intended to be mean spirited or racist ? I would stake internal organs it was not , its actually just a pretty good indian accent if we are being honest about it , its not a caricature its a character. 

Was the writers idea to include an american indian ...no wait and indian american  ...an indian who lives in america ...to mock the indian people or culture ? Again I would stake essential parts of my anatomy (dealers choice) that the answer is no ….the whole show is constantly a reflection of the world in which we live and the vast majority of convenience store attendants are indian . 

Sure they have poked some fun as they have at EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY but they have also educated and enlightened and been able to develop the character and use him in a good way to reflect actual racism concepts . There are 700 million hindus you know (approximately on 1990 stats somewhere) they are not just miscellaneous. 


So my problem with someone who I perceive to have grown up as a relatively privileged indian in america and unfortunately suffered racism at the hands of those who have taken the name of a cartoon character on tv to make fun of him and others of his ancestry is that he is firing at the wrong target. Having apu on the show and voiced by someone who was not indian is not the actual issue , the issue is the people who weaponised the characters name . If anyone tells me that they would not have been racist towards indians if apu was never around or if he was voiced by an indian I would call them a filthy liar . 

Pick your targets and know thine enemy ...from what ive learned working with many indians over the years , they have a keen sense of humour and some ive asked and all ive described the scenario to and some of the plot lines do not believe it to be racist . 


end transmission 

PS dont blame me I voted for kodos 

addendum 
the above was written after many many years of seeing countless pieces of clickbait online with the “cancel it because I no longer enjoy” sentiment , then just as id finished my impassioned plea to the contrary but hadnt found anywhere to put it online for maximum effect I happened upon another hack personal opinion piece from an alleged fan titled “the simpsons has been in decline as long as ive been alive : why its time for the show to end for good” @ the guardian online of all places … so I felt the need to respond to some more specifics. 
The article is a general reflection of how society has become far too comparative (this seasons better than that season) , aggressively and narcissistic criticism is beyond belief and appreciation is minimal. For example from the article “its impossible to explain succiintly why modern simpsons doesnt work . Its not funny , sure” . I cannot believe this was checked and others never thought to point out the level of selfish inherent within. 
I find it funny ever single week , I wait with intense anticipation for a new one just as soon as they are ready for semi illegal downloading (thanks to all those who share with a nobody from the arse end of the planet) and not one single time have they ever let me down. There is no point comparing , just detracts from the enjoyment . 

To say things like less than a million viewers means they are now irrelevant is ludicrous and here is the big reveal to make you think about the point of the article and general sentiment behind wanting it to end . Ive decided long ago that once the simpsons is done so is my time on this planet , I have no other point to exist I shall not be missed . Is this a weird sentiment , sure but think about this before you decide that something you no longer enjoy should no longer exist purely because YOU no longer enjoy it ...what about the other million ? And probably many many more millions around the world  ? 

further to all this to highlight just how we can see the same thing with different eyes , I felt the elon musk episode was actually mocking him more than anything and it had to be done that way as he is actually pretty smart (just not nice) which I felt they saw through and exposed quite well. 

To attack the voice quality of the show is a weak and nasty premise (age happens there is nothing you can do about the changes it brings) , I have noticed the changes and I dont feel they have affected my enjoyment of the jokes and general vibe of the show which still to this day in every way is based on questioning the status quo and not just giving in to authority because its authority ...it has been mocking all humanity from the get go and forever may it continue. 
To question whether it is still subersive and calling it hackneyed (yet also complaining that it has changed) seems to me was done by someone who hasnt actually watched in 20 years ….it has never given up that premise with lots of the varieties of life thrown into the mix every single time 

There was conjecture about homer still or having stopped strangling bart and it was confirmed it is still a part of the dymanic ….. my personal take is that kids (real ones around the entire globe) are still under threat from adults probably now more than ever so is the simspons still relevant and holding society to account , regardless of if society ever gets it ...yes yes they are . 
And yes they will also reflect the current zeitgeist and constantly evolve (or de-evolve as is the case with human “society”) and reflect the change or lack thereof within . 

Is it different yes is that bad no , if it didnt change there would be hundreds of terribly written “pieces” questioning why it didnt change ….the essence here and commonality is that humans are never satisfied. 
Is the simpsons perfect ? No ,  however it is probably as close as humanity will ever get and we should celebrate every single one OR JUST STOP WATCHING dont ruin it for anyone else and try to get others on board your hate train ... y so negative ?",0,1761220018.0,TheSimpsons,10,0.25,False
1oe132n,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oe132n/espresso_and_coffee_grinder_recommendations_for/,Espresso and Coffee Grinder Recommendations for Beginner? [$200],"Hello! I’m pretty new to the world of coffee. I’ve mainly been drinking K-cups and pre-ground coffee my whole life, but I’m starting to get more curious about grinding my own beans and improving my cup.

I've been researching into grinders and think a hand grinder would make sense since it's mainly for myself and also the build quality would beat an electric grinder at the same price point. I am overwhelmed by the amount of options out there though.

Right now I have access to a drip coffee maker, an AeroPress, and a moka pot. Ideally, I’d like a grinder that can handle both regular coffee and espresso-level grinds (for when I eventually upgrade my setup).

My budget is around $50, but I’m willing to go up to $200 if it’s really worth it. That said, I’m still at the entry level, so I’m not sure if it makes sense to invest that much just yet.

I’d also prefer something that’s easy to maintain and clean since I’m still learning.

1oe0jzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/attentioneering/comments/1oe0jzx/your_brain_is_lying_to_you_about_what_actually/,Your brain is lying to you about what actually distracts you,"You got distracted during your focused work session. Your mind wandered. You checked your phone. You reorganized your desk instead of writing that paragraph.

Tomorrow you sit down to work again. The same distractions happen. You notice them, feel frustrated, then forget about them until next time.

The next day, same thing. 

This cycle repeats because you're not tracking patterns. You're just experiencing distractions as isolated incidents.

Keep a Distraction Catcher on your desk while you do deep work. A piece of paper + a pen. That's all you need.

When something pulls your attention away, write it down immediately. Not after your work session. In the moment. Write down what distracted you. What time it happened. How it made you feel.

*""Checked email. 10:23am. Anxious about client response.""*

*""Thought about grocery list. 10:47am. Worried I'd forget bread""*

*""Scrolled Reddit. 11:04am. Bored with difficult paragraph.""*

Most people think they know what distracts them. They're usually wrong. Your brain lies about this. You remember the obvious stuff like notifications, but miss the subtle patterns. The time of day when your focus drops. The specific type of task that triggers phone-checking. The emotion that precedes each distraction.

After five sessions, review your notes. Look for patterns. You'll see things you didn't notice before.

Maybe you always get distracted around 10:45am. That's when your coffee wears off. Solution: schedule your break then instead of fighting through it.

Maybe you check your phone most when working on outlines. Not drafts. Not edits. Just outlines. That specific cognitive task makes you uncomfortable. Now you can start to approach it differntly.

Maybe you reorganize your desk when you're frustrated, not bored. The distraction isn't the problem. The emotion is.

**One major pattern you'll notice is that most of the distractions come from wihtin you.**

You can't fix what you don't measure. Awareness creates the possibility of change.

Note that your brain will fight this. It doesn't want to be observed.",2,1761218290.0,attentioneering,0,1.0,False

I'm conducting a survey to open a lifestyle club, so I'd be very grateful if you'd like to respond. My project is based in Estonia, but since I haven't yet managed to gather the required number of respondents in my country, I want to get the perspectives of people from all over the world. So, imagine opening a lifestyle club. The idea is that as a club member, you gain access to networking, meeting different people, participating in joint training sessions, events, and discounts from partners at various places like coffee shops, fitness clubs, and more.

I hope you'll be interested in responding to this survey, so I'd be very happy if you'd like to do so.

Thank you in advance.

I am with a system and date multiple alters including the host. 
Comunication hasn't been the best. I am aware that everyone is very different, has different views and sensitivity. Which has taken me a long time to adjust too but I know it's necessary for all their health, respect for them and following boundaries.  

Issue I am having though, that I can't seem to fix is I keep saying the wrong stuff. I think I am being nice but then suddenly I have hit a unknown trigger and I am thrown into the deep end. 

Example of triggers I have learned are like don't comment on studies( positive or negative), even if he is talking to you about it. Don't comment on their roles. I said ok be gentle in resopnse to some one wanting to confront anouther alter. I knew other alter was sensitive. Didn't ened well.
 Don't alwasy apologize they hate over apologizing. 
Don't talk about your famly life, spifically to much, triggers them( mostly as they want to protect me but yes) 
don't be negative all the time or bring up issue to often, I have depression, makes them stressed. So been trying to hold back on that as ya they not my therapist. 

But still Generally we could be talking about coffee and suddenly we arguing. I have gotten to the point of just saing ""ok"" responses.  I don't know how to be more ingaging with out slipping up. 

It's not his fault I keep doing this and stepping over sensitivitys. Wether I know them or not I  Need to actually think before I speak properly with out spiraling.

For context I am 26M with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy (GMFCS II). When covering longer distances I use croatches. 

Hi, I know that fatigue is a significant problem for many folks with CP. However since few years it is the most debilitating symptom that I experience. I barley experince any chronic pain. I dont suffer from insomnia, yet on daily basis when I wake up fatigue is just too much to manage. No matter how long I sleep I wake up exhausted and very often struggling to take a shower or fetch myself a sandwich or scrambled eggs. I wake up with this headache, dry mouth and constantly heavy eyes. I dont feel like daily naps help with this even the tighnies bit.For example the only things that I managed to do yesterday was going psychotherapy, buying flowers for my girlfriend and making myself scrambled eggs between naps. I slept from 12p.m. to 5p.m. and then from 7p.m. to 9a.m. without brushing teeth or changing clothes coz i didnt have any energy to do it. I tried to write this post yeasterday but it was impossible. It felt like I was hitting a wall in my head and I couldnt formulate a sentence. Yesterdays oversleeping didnt help with absolute exhaustion. Today I need to attend university for 3h and I feel like I dont have enough physical strength to take a metro to the campus. I feel like sleep doesnt restore my energy. I go to sleep axhausted and wake up axhaused just wishing for time to pass so I can go to sleep again. I adressed this issue numerous times with a doctor but both my thyroid and bood panel are fine. I have also done an at home sleep study which excluded sleep apnea.

I talked about my experince with a friend who has spastic qudriplegic cerebral palsy (GMFCS III) and she told me, that she doesn't experince fatigue that is so profound and the only times that she actualy struggled to get out of bed ir get to work was because of depression.

I am not depressed jut sevirely fatigued. I wish to do fun activities and stay on top of my university asigment but I am just too tired. Even if I drink coffee or take metylphrnitate very often my head is foggy and I cant articulate my thoughts. 

Guys could you please tell me about the fatigue that you experience? Maybe my level of fatigue is nothing out of the ordinary and it can be atributed to CP. If you could please describe your fatigue it would be very helpful. I am jut worried that I am more tired than I should be and I don't know if I should keep looking for a cause or just accept the reallity. ",1,1761218213.0,CerebralPalsy,5,1.0,False

Normally I just push through and submit whatever, but this time I decided to get some outside feedback before sending it in.

I ended up using [SpeedyPaper](https://speedypaper.fun/), mostly because I saw people mention it before and it looked… not scammy for once. I just sent them my draft for review, and they helped fix structure, flow, and phrasing — nothing crazy, just solid, clear editing that made everything sound cleaner.

It still sounded like me, just less chaotic and way more readable. Honestly? Kinda saved me from another “I’ll do it later” all-nighter.

Not saying it’s for everyone, but sometimes getting fresh eyes on your essay makes all the difference.

1oe0il0,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1oe0il0/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

A little more about myself... 35 year old, bi (very new to guys) from the United Kingdom, south Asian ethnicity, medium build, salt and pepper look, working professional. I’m looking to have some nice, maybe flirty conversations with nice guys. I'm open to pretty much anything so we can chat about absolutely anything or everything... Life, movies/tvs, day to day stuff, favourite meal, you name it, it's on the table! And plus who doesn't like speaking and getting to know new people!

There’s a lot more but let’s leave some stuff for the chats. 

If you’re bi, gay etc and looking for something similar then please send a message. Ideally I want a long term thing, a meet up and coffee would be nice too.

I usually do pretty well on dating apps — I get a fair amount of matches and DMs, and I’ve got a small following on Instagram too. Most of the time, when I reply to someone, they seem genuinely excited. They’ll compliment me, keep the conversation going, and even plan nice first dates — dinners, coffee, walks, you name it.

The first date usually goes well, and most of the time it leads to a second one. But after that, things start to fade. The energy changes. They either start replying slower, cancel plans, or just quietly disappear without saying anything.

It’s not like I’m sleeping with them right away or giving off weird energy (at least I don’t think so). I genuinely try to connect and get to know them. But it’s happened enough times now that I can’t help but wonder — what’s turning them off?

1oe0b4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1oe0b4b/meds_arent_just_helping_me_be_clean_and_organised/,"Meds aren’t just helping me be clean and organised, they are making enjoy it to a hobby level?","I’m coming up to two months on Vyvanse, and it’s been pretty great overall. I could talk about the meds in so many different ways, but for the sake of not going into multiple tangents, I want to talk about this one thing I’ve noticed since taking meds. 


As the title says, my meds are going past the level of making me clean and organised, to the point where I take enormous pride in keeping my space clean and planning/organising has became almost a hobby. 


I’ve always thought of myself as a clean, person with huge awareness of the space around me. Space and design is something I’ve always loved, and I always felt more sensitive to spaces. I always knew I had a sensitivity to clutter, mess, and needing the right lighting, vibe, etc in a room (in hindsight, this was definitely sensory issues)… The problem was that my ADHD was severely holding me back in regards to keeping my spaces the way I needed them. I was in a cycle of messing my space, getting incredibly overwhelmed by the mess, and struggling to help myself. 


With cleaning and organising my space:


* The very first day I took meds, I cleaned my room and for the first time in my life I have been able to keep it up on a daily basis. I always knew how good I felt in a clean room, but pre meds it took huge energy to get myself to do it, let alone keep it up. 


* Another thing to add is that I suffer from huge time blindness in regards to estimating task times, so in my mind I would have 4 hours of cleaning hanging over my head, when in reality It was 1 hour max. This is something I’m still working on, but cleaning more regularly is starting to give me a better sense of time and how long tasks actually take. 


* It’s like I was a clean person all along, and my ADHD was going against myself. Once medicated, I could cater to my sensory/space needs. I absolutely love making my bed in the morning, organising my space and lighting a candle. It feels like who I am deeper than medication getting me to do it. 



I’m beyond grateful to gain a love for looking after my space, but here’s where things are feeling like a borderline hobby: 


* I started journaling, particularly bullet journaling. I absolutely love setting up my daily log and keeping track of everything. By everything, It’s past keeping dates and scheduling. It’s became a full hobby having a space in my journal dedicated to logging anything from hikes to films I’ve watched. 


* I love making packing lists, and learning how to travel better. I recently bought travel organisers like toiletry bags, packing cubes, electronic bags, meds/vitamin storage. I’m genuinely excited about making myself more comfortable when traveling 


* I love making lists of places I want to go, particularly in cities I visit/ intend on visiting. Coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants, sightseeing, etc have been marked out for me on google maps, so when I am somewhere else I can see whats near me. 


* I love learning more about myself on a deeper level. Keeping track of my emotions, how things are going and where I’m at. One way I express this is via posts like this, and It’s lovely to receive feedback. 



Pre meds: 

* I was always a mess when it came to packing and travel. It brought huge stress and I always needed to seek help from my partner or family. 

* I didn’t have the attention to organise myself, and played it off as being “easy going” to others.. I came across as low maintenance because my ADHD was stopping me to give myself anything but low maintenance.. 

* I thought people who are very organised were high strung. I didn’t think it was something that could be genuinely enjoyed until now. 



Now, I still have certain quirks: 

*  I get a little overwhelmed and zone out when I’m in a group and people start coming up with lots of different plans. It’s not that I don’t like planning, but I need the alone time to sit and focus on plans.. Multiple voices are just an information overload. 


* I tend to need time to consider the plans alone, and have been questioned on why I can’t say yes or no straight away. To be honest, I think this is still improvement as before meds I struggled with people pleasing and just would have said yes instead of “I’ll come back to you on it”. 



So here’s where I’m at here. I hope the post isn’t too long, and that I’ve formatted it to be easily read. I’d love to know if anyone else has experienced this, or what their opinion of this is!

So far, I’ve adjusted the bean intensity x water temperature (running 9 coffees in total + an additional one to check on the ‘best’ result, which was still pretty dire.

During this I also changed the beans to ones I got from a coffee shop which I know has good coffee instead of my original shop bought ones.

I graduated uni in 2021, just prior to the initial release of ChatGPT, so I didn’t use LLMs during my studies. But even after becoming employed, LLMs didn’t come into the picture for me.

My team works on a fairly complex project (an SDK / unified set of libraries) that involves active development in 4 languages and targets 5 different platforms. It is then distributed both to other internal teams and to external clients to integrate in customer products. Because of the importance of the project for the company, we are required to ensure the highest level of code quality and my team is thus forbidden to ship AI-generated code (this also applies to a few other selected teams). Now, while there isn’t any reliable way to enforce this (except good code review practices), most of the team consists of already experienced developers so we have just continued to work like in the pre-LLM era, business-as-usual. And it turns out that we are meeting deadlines and expectations just fine.

As for personal projects, I have dabbled with LLMs a few times, but I honestly haven’t been convinced by the whole thing. I just can’t see the productivity gain that everyone is excited about. Tbf, I have a pretty minimalistic setup (by today’s standards) and I also do not use modern IDEs, autocomplete, copilot, etc. For me personally, they distract me from the actual code, and my environment is a simple text-editor with syntax highlighting and LSP, a debugger, music, coffee. I am comfortable and productive that way, and I still build decent projects.

Let’s give credit where it is due, I do sometimes use LLMs as conversation assistants, mostly to discuss some ideas. But for coding? I am just not able to trust code that hasn’t been written by a competent human being.

So, the year is 2025. I’m 28, thinking about my future in this field. I haven’t shipped any LLM code so far, and I’m starting to feel like an alien. How uncommon is it? Am I completely missing the hype? Genuinely interested in all your takes.",0,1761216696.0,cscareerquestionsEU,32,0.38,False

My name’s Jonny - hip hop artist, writer, and lifelong student with a heavy interest of the streets. I’m working on a coffee table style book that’s been brewing in me for years. It’s about the high-rise commission flats of Melbourne not just the buildings, but the people inside them. The stories, the perseverance, the splendor, the chaos and the resilience of those within them.

These towers aren’t just concrete—they’re vertical neighborhoods. I’ve lived near them, in them, around them. I’ve seen lives unfold in them and unfortunately end in them. I’ve felt the pulse of survival and community echo through many storeys. And now, I want to document it.

This book isn’t a plastic gangster tribute. It’s not a poverty-porn exposure. It’s a real look at real people. And I need your help.

**Who I’m Looking to Interview:**

If you’ve lived in or around Melbourne’s commission flats—or even just passed by them—I want to hear from you. Especially if you’re:

* An immigrant or refugee
* A drug user or dealer (past or present)
* A builder, cleaner, or maintenance worker
* A musician, artist, or creative
* A politician or activist
* A sportsperson or coach
* A single mum or dad
* A disabled person navigating the system
* A foster kid, youth worker, or teacher
* A neighbour, passer-by, or someone with a story to tell

If you’ve got a voice, I need to hear it.

**What This Is About:**

I’m collecting interviews, memories, photos and reflections—raw and real. You can stay anonymous if you want. You can write me a memoir; I can send you a bunch of questions and I want you to speak freely. I’m not here to judge or edit your truth. I’m here to amplify it.

**How to Get Involved:**

Email me and I’ll follow up with a few questions if you like. I’m currently serving a sentence in a Melbourne prison with my earliest for parole set in late Feb next year. I have a laptop with a locked down internet connection, with an email account that allows myself and a friend to communicate.

If this has gathered your attention, I’m sure you aware that the state government has been demolishing these buildings and plan to have them all gone by 2032, so let’s make sure your stories don’t disappear with the towers.

# Chapter 1: Chapter 1 — The Day That Returned



The old clock on Sarah Knight’s nightstand ticked with indecent confidence. Morning light made a hard rectangle across the duvet. For one stunned breath she lay very still, certain the roar in her head was the ballroom ceiling coming down again—the white‑hot glare, the tilt of chandeliers, the sound of crystal screaming as if glass could beg for mercy.



A soft knock punctured the terror. Emily eased in with a tray. “Miss? Your father said to be sure you ate. Should I call Dr. Ellis?”



“No,” Sarah said. “What day is it?”



“Thursday,” Emily replied after a glance at her phone. “The twentieth. There’s a meeting at eleven.” She smiled. “I ironed the white dress. The one with pockets.”



Eleven. The twentieth. The words clicked into old grooves. “Thank you,” Sarah said. “Coffee. Black.”



When the door clicked shut, the room felt too tender to bear. Orange blossom perfume lingered on the vanity—her mother’s favorite. Sarah pressed her palms to her eyes until constellations burst behind her lids, then slid a small spiral notepad into the pocket of the square‑necked dress and braided her hair back with hands that trembled once.



Downstairs, the house hummed. Security men bracketed doorways: present, discreet. “Morning, Miss Knight,” said Mason, the broad‑shouldered one with the gentle eyes. “Your father’s in the study.”



“Thank you. And Mason?”



“Miss?”



“Check the extinguishers today. All of them.”



He blinked. “Already serviced last week.”



“Check again.”



He studied her for a beat, then nodded. “Will do.”



Her father’s study smelled like cedar and coffee. He stood at the window, back straight under a gray suit, morning light catching the silver at his temples. At the sound of the door, he softened by degrees. “There you are,” he said. “You’re late for breakfast and early for trouble. Which is it?”



“Trouble.” Her voice wobbled. She crossed to him and adjusted his crooked tie—he always knotted too fast when he was thinking—and tried to memorize every line of his face at once. Alive, she thought, the word like a prayer. Alive.



“Cold feet?” he asked lightly, though his eyes were knives honed on something he distrusted.



“In a manner of speaking.”



“Sit,” he said, taking the chair opposite. He never wasted time. “I don’t like this match,” he said. “The boy comes with too much history.”



Heat started in her palms, memory unspooling without mercy. She knew the story: a triangle offered as charity, a shadow in every photograph, a household where love was a stage direction.



“Eat,” her father said gently, misreading the silence as nerves. “We’ll decide what we decide. Nothing is inevitable, Sarah.”



Nothing is inevitable. The phrase opened a door she had nailed shut. Behind it waited the night she never stopped hearing.



The banquet was late autumn—a fundraiser under chandeliers the size of small cars. Her father made his rounds, scolding donors into generosity with a dry wit no one refused. Music poured. Overhead, the chandelier hummed faintly, a beehive of light.



The fire began as a soft wavering at the edge of the ceiling. Then the lights died, and smoke rolled in thick as velvet. She remembered security opening a path, tablecloths used as slings, strangers kneeling at strangers’ sides. She remembered a certain man crossing the room—not to her, not to her father, but to the girl with the ribbon, his body curving to shield someone who wasn’t his wife. He barked at the team—Get her out, now—and the good men obeyed while the room convulsed.



Then the ceiling gave. A low animal groan bent the air. Crystal fell in a glittering storm. Brass and wire tore loose. The first impact felt like being inside a bell. Tables leapt. People fell. The floor turned into a cold mouth swallowing shoes and glass and prayer.



She didn’t remember deciding to move. She remembered the sound that left her when her father disappeared in the storm of dust—small, terrible, private. It lived in her throat for months.



It took hours to find him. The memory came in cuts: grit under her nails; the taste of marble dust; black T‑shirts gone gray with ash; a shoe vanishing beneath debris; swallow‑hard commands from men who refused to quit; sirens braiding a thin, bright ribbon through the roar. Someone pressed a water bottle into her hand, the cap already loosened because plastic threads eat time. Mason said, “Miss, let us,” as if grief could be negotiated.



She did not let. She clawed until her nails split and bled, until her breath sawed, until her hands were no longer hands but tools. Men knelt beside her and dug and lifted and set jaw to task. When at last they found a sleeve, a shoulder, the hard line of a jaw, the world drew a line she could not cross back over.



There was the ambulance’s sterile light, the smell of antiseptic and metal, a stranger’s palm pressed to hers in the ER because the nurses were busy and kindness is whoever is standing there. Later there was a corridor that knew her footsteps by heart. Later there was morning, bright, continuing without her.



Now the memory burned through her again, old as last night and sharp as today’s paper. She pressed her palm flat on her father’s desk to still a shake she would not show anyone.



“Sarah?” he said softly. “Stay with me.”



“I am,” she said, and forced a smile. “Logistics.” She lifted her chin, the way he had taught her to do when a boardroom tilted. “If we host anything in the next month, I want the chandeliers inspected. The load‑bearing beams, too. Evacuation routes printed and posted. Security protocols reviewed line by line.”



“My spreadsheet‑loathing daughter wants a safety audit?”



“Humor me.”



He nodded. “Done.” He hesitated, then covered her hand with his. “Nothing is inevitable,” he repeated. “No choice, no match, no night.”



After he left, the house settled into familiar quiet: the hum of the vent, the tick of the mantel clock. Sarah stared at the desk’s grain until it blurred. Memory rose one last time, brutal and bright: the moment dust cleared and they saw her father’s face, gray as stone and just as still—then the weak flicker of his eyelids, the tiny movement that split the world into Before and After. A man shouted for a gurney. Someone sobbed with relief so hard it sounded like choking. She touched her father’s cold wrist and felt a pulse argue with the void.



She closed her eyes now against the echo of that pulse. When she opened them, she looked through the doorway across the hall.



Her father sat on the sofa in the small sitting room, glasses low on his nose, reading. Alive. He looked up as if he felt her attention, eyebrow lifting in question. She managed a smile and raised her empty coffee cup in a silent request for more. He tipped his head toward the kitchen, a private joke from childhood—get it yourself, captain—that meant I see you, I am here.



Sarah’s throat tightened. She stood very straight, as if posture alone could keep a promise, and breathed in the cool air of a house not on fire. The past was a warning, not a prophecy. She would treat it that way.



On a fresh page of the little spiral notepad, she wrote three lines in a hand so firm she would recognize it even if the paper burned:



No triangles.



No smoke.



I will not repeat this life.



She underlined the last sentence once, hard enough to mark the page beneath, slipped the notebook into her pocket, and went to find her father, alive and well in a world she had been given a second time—and would not waste.

1odzr75,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1odzr75/pssd_recoveryremission_windows_after_cessation_of/,PSSD Recovery/Remission Windows after Cessation of Caffeine,"A few months ago, I (29M) created a post on this subreddit and crossposted to r/AskPsychiatry asking if there were any known interactions between the prescribed uses of the SSRI antidepressants Paroxetine (Paxil)/Fluoxetine (Prozac) and caffeine; or, any known interactions between the atypical (NDRI) antidepressant Buproprion (Wellbutrin) and caffeine. I created the post because Ive been struggling with sexual dysfunction since starting medication(s) (discontinued in May 2025). I'm experiencing PSSD symptoms since my discontinuation (after a stage 3 hypertensive crisis). I deleted the post because it didn't get a lot of attention and I didn't think anyone else found the experience useful. I've decided to return and re-share my experience, as its existence here isn't really harming anything.

In my post, I wrote that I had experienced, what I now understand this subreddit refers to as a ""window"" of, recovery/remission after cessation of the consumption of caffeine/caffeinated products. During my first ""window"", I had a 100% return of my sexual function with regards to my penis and testes. My symptoms include:

* Genital Numbness: The glans penis and frenulum lost a vast majority (90%) of their pleasurable sensations. I was still able to feel some degree of pain, but it seemed as though the nerves or receptors (aside from nocireceptors) were ""blocked"" or turned off. I have some degree of enjoyment inside the shaft/urethra/corpus cavernosa themselves, but that's all very ""internal"" and not the same kind of pleasure.
* Delayed Ejaculation: Prior to PSSD, masturbation would last, on average, 15-20 minutes. I could go shorter or longer depending if I was in a rush or edging; but, just at a natural pace, that was my time. I don't know the experience of others with penises, but I'm able to control my body/muscles in such a way where I can evoke an ejaculation sooner if I wanted. I didn't realize I could do this until after developing PSSD. After these symptoms developed, that amount of control seemingly disappeared even though I was going through the same mental/bodily motions. Masturbation for me became a challenge of at least 30 minutes, minimum, but usually requiring longer. I like to describe the onset of ejaculation as a build-up (reaching a threshold before a climax). With PSSD, this build-up doesn't exist to the same degree that I know/experience.
* Anorgasmia: Different from ejaculation, the pleasure of an orgasm disappeared for me. It was very obvious when I was ejaculating, but the pleasure associated with it was gone or mostly muted. I can feel the muscles contracting in my body to cause the ejaculation. Without PSSD, that was something I never really paid attention to.
* Testicular Pain: During/after ejaculating, my testes wouldn't rise closer to my body. I'm not sure if this is a common; I've never seen anyone report it (not that I've done a lot of research on symptoms). I also experience a moderate amount of pain/discomfort from my testes.
* Absence of [Frisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson#Violations_of_musical_expectancy): Frisson, or psychogenic shivers, is a phenomenon in which a person experiences goose bumps or chills as a response to pleasurable stimuli. I would experience this after urination involuntarily prior to PSSD; however, since developing PSSD, any kind of Frisson (like from listening to music) ended for me.
* Emotional Numbness: I have moderate Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Both are diagnosed by mental health professionals. I feel like there is some sort of psychological wall/barrier between my consciousness and my ability to experience formerly intense, consuming feelings of fear and grief. While many may find this symptom a blessing or treatment (the SSRIs worked, to an extent), I feel as though this is an indication that my brain/body never fully returned to ""normal"" after discontinuation.

I am currently experiencing my third window of symptom remission. My first window occurred on accident when I stopped drinking coffee for a period of time (didn't have money to buy it, didn't continue the habit of buying it after getting paid). After three weeks of zero caffeine use, my symptoms gradually alleviated (everything except emotional numbness). I was shocked. I think I masturbated three times in one day because I couldn't believe it.

At some point after my first window, I started drinking coffee again (decaf), and my symptoms returned. I found it very odd because I was drinking exclusively decaf and symptoms persisted. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I learned that decaffeinated coffee isn't 100% caffeine free in the US. Devastated, I began my three-week caffeine cleanse hoping a new window would occur.

Miraculously (exaggerative), my symptoms abated after only one week of no caffeine. An incredible improvement. I imagine that because decaf has so much less caffeine in it compared to regular coffee, the recovery time was much faster. 

Unfortunately, I forgot that chocolate also has caffeine in it and went on a small chocolate kick and lost my second window to it. While chocolate, of course, has considerably less caffeine in it than coffee, I'm beginning to wonder what the threshold is for me, specifically, regarding caffeine and PSSD symptoms.

I'm currently entering my third window after being 100% coffee and 99% milk/dark chocolate free (white chocolate is okay because it doesn't contain cocoa solids; hence, why people say it isn't real chocolate).

I'm super curious to hear if anyone else has seen alleviation of symptoms with discontinued consumption of caffeine. Caffeine is the most used, legal, drug in the world and I think it would be groundbreaking news for so many people if caffeine interacted with SSRIs on some level with some amount of the population, even if the reason isn't understood.

1odzqqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1odzqqg/my_2_cents_to_people_joining_their_mba/,My 2 cents to people joining their MBA,"[By: u/awisekiddo]

A batch of 2024 passout here. 

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.


 
2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.


  
3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.



4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 



5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay



6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 
  


7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  
 



8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".
 


9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 
  


10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 



11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you'll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  
 


12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH*T WHERE YOU EAT.   



13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 
 


14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. 




15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.




16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  
 


17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 
  


18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.



19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 



20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  



21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined. 



Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or 
more out of money, time, energy). 
All the very best 💯❤️💞🧿




P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   


Addition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. 

Addition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 
 


Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. 

P.S: **I'll soon do another ""2 cents"" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this ""2 cents"" for the ones who've or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I'm amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.**

Also, thank you for showing so much love to the post. I hope this inspires you all to work hard and get into the best BSchools :) ❤️💞

So, long story short — I’m a straight guy (or at least I always thought I was), but I ended up going out with this gay guy. He was actually the one who liked me first — he gave me a like, showed interest, and I went along with it. I invited him for a drink, we went out, had our first date, and everything went great.

We basically saw each other every day for about a week. He even stayed over multiple times. But these last two days… I’ve felt a big shift. His interest just dropped.

Last night he came over, gave me just a small peck when he arrived, and we hung out with my roommate — drinking, joking around, all that. My roommate also noticed he seemed kinda down. I asked him like five times if he was okay, and he just said he was tired.

He’s been super slow texting back (like every 10 hours), and last night while we were joking around, I worried maybe one of the jokes bothered him — I asked several times if something was wrong, he said no. But he didn’t hug me at all while sleeping, which was super weird because we usually sleep cuddled up.

This morning I asked if he wanted tea or coffee like usual, and he said nothing, just gave me a quick kiss when leaving (again, just a small one like when he arrived).

I haven’t texted him since he left a couple of hours ago. I just feel really weird. Never had anything like this happen before, and honestly I don’t even know what to make of it — about him, or about myself.

1odzol3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1odzol3/a_night_at_the_haunted_house/,A night at the haunted house,"It was a crisp winter night. The full moon hung bright in the sky with a hazy glow around it, casting an eerie light over the dark neighbourhood. Luca, Lucia, Alis, Kile, and I, Helen, stood on the street in front of the gate in the waist-high stone wall leading up the path to the worn-down house that everyone said was abandoned and haunted It was the infamous haunted house, known for its chilling tales and ghostly sightings things moving without reason and lights going on and off with no one in the room.
Today, during lunch break, in the garden in front of Oxford University, Lucia, a dark brown-haired daring girl in my science class, had walked up to me and said, T have dared Alis, Kile, and Luca to stay one night at the haunted house at the edge of Oxford, and now Im daring you to. I want everyone to get to know each other better. We do have a science project together, after all, and I thought this was the perfect way."" And obviously, I who never shied away from a challenge, accepted.
Our teacher had divided our science class into teams and intentionally mixed the groups to pair people with contrasting personalities. So,I ended up with Luca, the coolest boy in school- -tall with black hair and brown eyes, always wearing a ridiculously cocky grin. Alis, as his counterpart, was the prettiest girl in school with her big blue eyes and blonde hair. Lastly, there was Kile, a rower, well-built and brooding. Lucia didn't actually like him much, so I think she invited him for protection more than to get to know him. And then there's me- the golden-haired, glasses-wearing bookworm, the nerd.
After our university classes had ended for the day, we all went home to gather our things for the stay and agreed to meet back at the school in one hour, so Lucia could drive us the ten-minute ride to the haunted house. We climbed out of the van and stood at the end of the pathway, filled with anticipation. I went through the gate first, as it creaked open. As we approached the three-story house with dirty white walls and red shutters, I couldn't help but smile inwardly. This was my home, after all. I had lived here for vears, ever since inheriting it from my eccentric great-aunt. At first, I had hated living in the haunted house
and only stayed because it was near the university and cheaper to live in than the dorms. But after a while, the ghosts that lived here, supposedly haunting the place, became my friends, and I had grown quite fond of them. Part of the reason I accepted the challenge was because I had to protect my ghostly friends and make sure my human friends didn't harm them or change the house. I wanted them to find out the truth from me instead of when they came around for a study session where we wouldn't have the time or the opportunity to explain, and the fact that I wouldn't be scared and could show off was a plus.
The house was a bit run down and could probably use a lick of paint, but renovating it had always seemed like too much trouble, and the ghosts preferred it in its current condition anyway- they and I liked the fact that the history showed; it made it feel authentic.
The front door creaked open, and we stepped inside. The air was thick with the smell of freshly made bread and the scent of ground coffee that Ms. Elis, the ghost cook, had made. It felt comforting. As we stood in the hall, we could hear the rocking chair squeaking and sounds coming from the kitchen. My friends laughed nervously, trying to shake off the fear that clung to them. Alis wanted to explore the house, and we decided to split up to cover more ground. Alis and Lucia went right, towards the kitchen, whilst Luca and Kile went left, towards the stairs leading to the bedrooms. I was glad I remembered to lock mine and I went straight on towards the living room and dining room.
As I wandered through the cosily lit hallways, I greeted the familiar ghosts. I looked into the living room with its red-themed carpet and curtains and the wooden coffee table. I saw old Mrs. Thompson, who loved to knit by the fireplace in her rocking chair, currently knitting a jumper. She died of old age in this very house in the 17s, so let's say she was a bit old-fashioned but sweet. And young Tommy, who enjoyed playing pranks on unsuspecting visitors he had lived in this house and died of a cut that became infected in the 17th century. As I looked in, I said, ""Hi Mrs. Thompson. Hi Tommy, you better not play any pranks on our current visitors; theyre already scared out of their wits."" Mrs. Thompson smiled at me and said. will keep an eye on

him. You go have fun with your friends and keep in mind youre used to this place, so don't scare them too much."" ""I won't,"" I replied. At the news that he couldn't play pranks, Tommy just frowned and carried on playing with his toy cars, looking disappointed. I carried on along the long, wooden parquet-floored hallway with candelabras towards the kitchen, I thought of how nervous my friends were and how much they had reacted before to the simple everyday noises I was used to, like the bangs that Tommy made, Elis cooking, the clicks of Mrs. Thompson's knitting needles, and the creak of her rocking chair. I suppose these could seem spooky to an outsider. Maybe Mrs. Thompson had a point. But they all seemed to be enjoying the scare too- that is, after all, why you pick a haunted house to get to know each other. The ghosts were invisible to Luca, Alis, Kile, and Lucia because they were oblivious to the ghosts' presence. But my friends were growing increasingly scared; I could hear their small screams and jumps at every sound and groan of the old house. Their imaginations were running wild. I couldn't help but chuckle at their reactions. To be fair, though, Luca wasn't helping the matter by jumping out at the other three. He tried it with me too, but I was too used to Tommy doing the same thing, so I didn't even blink. His shocked face at the lack of reaction on my part, though, was priceless. I felt completely at ease in my home; the things they jumped at were an everyday occurrence for me.

When I arrived in the kitchen, I chatted with Mr. Jenkins, the former butler who still took pride in keeping the place clean and tidy, and he was excellent at it too. He had died of a heart attack in the 18th century, so he was formal and stiff. He gave me a cup of coffee and a slice of the warm bread that Elis, the ghost chef, had made when she saw us arrive through the kitchen window. Elis was an excellent cook who had sadly died when one of her rivals poisoned her in 2000. She was the youngest ghost, but her bread rolls were excellent- to die for, which in this house I probably shouldn't be saying, but what the heck. ""I hope you don't mind my human friends in the house, Jenkins. I will explain everything to them in the morning,"" I said, feeling a bit guilty. ""No, not at all, Helen. It's nice to have company and see new faces,"" he replied.
A moment later, my friends burst in, wide-eyed and pale because they had heard me talking to someone through the door as they had come looking for me. But as they came in, in a huddle, they saw no one. ""Who were you talking to?"" Luca asked, his voice trembling. ""Oh, just Mr. Jenkins,""'I replied casually. ""He's been here for ages."" They stared at me, confused and a little scared, but I didn't elaborate. Instead, I said, ""Why don't we go to the living room, where we can warm ourselves by the fre?"" Then I continued, turning to Jenkins, ""Ccan you make us some hot chocolate and gather the other ghosts so they can join in?"" Then, leaving the other four confused, I walked out of the room.
After the ghost oined us in the lving room and I had brought the hot chocolate so Jenkins didn't scare my friends by bringing the tray through without them seeing Jenkins, making it look like a floating tray, we all settled down. Tommy played in front of the fire, Mrs. Thompson knitted, and Jenkins stood stiffly in the corner. The experience was even more amusing because only I could see and hear the ghosts. I could hear the stories from the ghosts and my friends, along with sarcastic comments from Jenkins about my friends' ghost stories and their lack of accuracy. My friends and I got comfy- -Luca and Kile on one couch, Alis and I on the other, and Lucia sprawled in front of the fire like a cat.
We took turns telling spooky stories, scaring even me once or twice. As the night wore on, my friends' fear slowly turned to exhaustion. They huddled together, trying to stay awake, but eventually fell asleep in front of the fire around 1 a.m., while I felt completely relaxed. The ghosts kept me company, sharing their own tales and keeping the atmosphere light-hearted until I too fell asleep at 2 a.m., enjoying the evening in front of the warm fire.
Finally, the first light of dawn crept through the windows and climbed the walls. As it turned 9 o'clock, we all woke to the smell of pancakes and chocolate. We went into the kitchen and I saw Elis cooking. She stopped along with the other ghosts the moment they saw my friends.
so as not to scare them with objects moving by themselves.""Do you guys trust me?"" I asked. They all nodded at me.Then sit down. I need to explain a few things,"" I said, taking a seat myself. ""Alis, Lucia, Luca, Kyle, I have a confession to make. This is my house. I inherited it from my great-aunt. I live here, and the ghosts that haunt it are real and they are my friends."" I then looked at Elis, Jenkins, Tommy, and Mrs. Thompson one after another and said, ""Carry on. They need to see things moving and what you ghosts can do if they are going to believe it. I then looked back at my friends. As my friends saw things moving, their eyes widened in fear, but I could also see interest and curiosity. Lucia then spoke up, ""HIow can you see them? Is it possible for us to see them? If so, how?""I answered, ""If you want to see the ghosts, all you have to do is believe in them. Jenkins, the butler, is next to the hob making a cup of tea. Tommy, a little boy, is over by the window, playing with his toy cars, and his grandmother is at the other end of the table knitting a jumper. And Ms. Elis, a French chef, is making our delicious breakfast.""Their jaws dropped in shock, unable to believe what they were hearing and seeing as it sunk in. Then they gasped as the ghosts materialized before them- Mrs. Thompson with her grey hair, Tommy with freckles, Jenkins in his suit, and Elis in her chef's uniform. Alis asked, ""How do you live here if it is so old though?""
""Look around, I answered. As the light illuminated the room, they looked around the house, now bathed in the soft morning light. They realized that the place didn't seem so scary anymore; it wasn't that old either. It was just a house with a lot of history and a few friendly spirits. Pictures hung on the walls and ornaments on the countertops along with some of my craft projects scattered around the room. I then showed them my bedroom and said, ""This is a normal household, iust the majority of those how live here are ghosts."" My friends had survived the night and gotten the scare they wanted from the haunted house, but more importantly, We had shared an unforgettable experience that had bonded us all. My friends left with a new perspective on the haunted house, and I felt a sense of satisfaction that they now knew the truth.

Strange how the most opposite friends attract. It just goes to show even the normal nerd in school can have his or her quirky secrets that make them cool in their own way.
