So currently I have just over 10k saved right now

Make roughly 60k per year

Saving €1000 p/m 

Hoping to apply for a mortgage in maybe 10-14 months or so 

I understand bank statements should be clean, but to what extent?

Would getting a Costa coffee twice a week or lunch each day, or a few subscriptions be looked at negatively?

Some people say it's grand others say to just take out cash and only have your direct debits and savings showing on all your accounts. 

I want to make sure my statements are all in good order for when I'm going for my mortgage 

Any help is appreciated",1,1770848479.0,irishpersonalfinance,1,1.0,False

I’ll be in Mackay for a while for work and thought I’d say hi! I’m a 26-year-old robotics engineer from France, first time in the area.

Since I’ll be pretty far from home, it’d be great to meet some locals — whether it’s for a coffee, a beer, exploring the area, checking out the beach, or just a good chat. Always happy to discover new spots and meet new people.

If anyone’s keen, feel free to comment or DM me 🙂

1r2bkfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1r2bkfs/whoever_says_a_driving_license_doesnt_ruin_the/,Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying,"22M I posted about that before that I can't get a driving licesne due to a health con and I'm a lesser because of it and I'm thinking about suicide

 Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

Today she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about.

And I don’t care anymore about uni because I’ve spent my last days entirely in bed, and I haven’t gone outside the apartment at all. I’m ready to end it all, and please don’t give basic solutions like walkable cities, buses, or similar thing

Have a great day everyone",2,1770848392.0,confidence,1,1.0,False

He hasn’t acted differently at all. Still eats appetizers, still sends dumb memes. But I felt weirdly small walking in with a $12 bottle of wine when he has a climate-controlled wine room. I grew up middle class, I rent, I budget.

1r2bhye,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1r2bhye/20260211_for_the_cruising/,2026/02/11 for the cruising,"i woke up today around 6:30, lay around until 7:00 then got up to get ready for work.  i fed my fish and noticed one of them who has been sick for a while was now beyond saving.  it was one of my [orange fin danios](https://imgur.com/T9L8mbB) and this guy has a white spot that has gone and come back a few times but today i noticed he had pine-coning (his scales were sticking out at the sides) and that's basically it for a fish.  i had my [oat bowl](https://imgur.com/sewVUIC) and get dressed in all black.  i sat around yawning for a while then headed out.  

i got there early, around 8:40 and my boss immediately told me she wasn't going to have the store open today and that she was just about to phone me not to come in.  i'm sort of bummed the store wasn't open but also glad i came in because i'd forgotten my purse the day before.  it's not like i love this job and i'm going to say going home wasn't a relief in a way, but at the same time i have this job for a reason as part of my recovery so that's why i would have wanted to be there today.  my brain needs the activity and even when i try staying active at home, it's not the same level as working a day.  either way, i took it as a day off and appreciated it.  i'm back in on friday for a few hours which should work out well just to get me thinking a little.

i didn't do much at home but i did make a [curried vegetable](https://imgur.com/tTUemHX) mixture with some bell peppers and tomatoes that were going bad in the fridge.  i had them with a naan for [lunch](https://imgur.com/5PNEv4s) and an [iced coffee](https://imgur.com/WW5OosU).  unfortunately i then got around to putting down my fish.  if you're going to have fish, you should have clove oil.  it's a natural analgesic and a humane way to put down fish and you're eventually going to have to put down a fish even when you have medications.  it's really easy on the fish, they just go to sleep.

i took the dog around the block and then went out for a walk on my own.  if you're a man in my area, between the ages of 35 to 55, i'm out looking for you.  are you housed or provisionally accommodated?  good enough to say hello and that's all i want.  when i'm out cruising for guys, which frankly is what i do when i'm out these days, guys doing the most just say hello and i'm blown away by even that.  have to say my favourite place for guys right now is dollarama.  i don't talk to them but there have been some cute brothers in there that i appreciate.  

i'm not usually like this, but lately it's a thing for me.  it might be my version of sexually impulsive behaviour that can be seen in mania but for me it's just talking to a guy which i think is something i should be doing more often anyway because i am single.  i'm not hooking up with random guys, i'm just trying to get out of the house and stand next to someone too close at walmart.  

after my walk i had a couple of [maple cookies](https://imgur.com/UaL1twK).  then a [couple more](https://imgur.com/JdKPysh) and i'm still resisting the urge.  [dinner](https://imgur.com/ZrQUqfy) is the same as last night, a sausage with vegetable lasagna.  what's left of the day is the evening dog walk, a shower and probably a couple more maple cookies.

About me: female 30s, Oklahoma US

Context: Wednesday February 11th, 2026 \~2 pm

Weather: mild and sunny winter day!

Setting: day off; night at work; grandma’s house

Fragrance House: alloy studio -

“an experimental fragrance house.

based in NYC, the alloy studio creates perfumes and scented goods that feel like an extension of your style. we utilize beauty, fashion, and setting to tell stories through scent. our perfumes are made for invisible glamour. they can be your statement piece, or your armor. 

house codes

we use perfume to subvert, redefine, and glamorize. 

we use rare ingredients of the highest caliber, with a quality over quantity practice. our fragrances are hand batched and bottled in house, in nyc. 

our fragrances are generously dosed and considered ""eau de parfum"" or ""parfum"".

collaboration with artists, craftsmen, and creative talent is always our way. 

our fragrances are vegan & cruelty free.”

On the vision: “In our line, silver and gold respectively represent the spirit of collaboration and yin and yang between my partner and I. As we were creating the alloy studio together, we wanted to reflect our individual tastes and imaginations which resulted in the division of gold and silver. Gold represents my outlook on perfumery, often featuring a sense of ethereality and richness. Silver represents Eddie’s desires in perfume, featuring subversive, experimental concepts and ideas. These two elements form an alloy, something beautiful made through combination.”

Charity: “10% of all sales for the month of February will be donated to the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the Ali Forney Center.”

SOTD: Hypnotic Nectar -

“elements: yellow flowers. bitter herbs. florescent mushrooms. handfuls of roots. potions that connect you to nature.

scene: picking luminescent flowers and herbs in a secluded forest. a glamorously adorned shaman prepares you a drink made of crushed herbs and flowers. they promise you beauty and abundance if you accept it...”

Gender: unisex

Notes - “hypnotic nectar evokes an encounter with a den in a beautifully overgrown forest. there are no signs of life other than strangely luminous florals and fungi.

the den is inhabited by an abnormally glamorous shaman dressed in fabulous wooden jewelry. they welcome you warmly with a bitter botanical potion instead of tea or coffee. the shaman promises you the beverage will bring enlightenment and abundance. as you sip, you notice a luminescent glow coming from your chest, and your fingers begin to flower…

what is more enlightening or abundant than being one with nature?

top ●

ylang ylang. rosemary. elemi. mimosa flower.

heart ●●

matsutake mushroom. niaouli. sweet basil.

base ●●●

copaiba balsam. earth.

intensity:

bold ●●●

wear time: 7 - 8 hrs

an aromatic aura that blesses those around you all day.”

Accords (Parfumo): Earthy, Spicy, Woody, Resinous, Floral

Fragrance pyramid (Parfumo): Top -

Elemi resin, Rosemary, Mimosa, Ylang-ylang; Middle - Basil, Paperbark, Matsutake mushroom; Base - Copaiba balsam, Soil

Applied: one spray left and right inner elbow over clothing, chest on clothing.

First wear impression: very first whiff I like this one! It goes on like ramen straight from the bottle - possibly the mushroom and herbs but the dry down after just a minute is fantastic. Very floral to me! Lots of earthiness and a little spice like the broth of pho but in a good way I promise, it’s so comforting. I love this scent, it smells so good while also being interesting. I find it fascinating how the florals do read yellow, and yet despite being floral it does give unisex. Though it may lean the direction the wearer presents, so for me it doesn’t feel unfeminine! My partner mentioned it (almost? I forget what he said) smells like cologne, but I disagree! It’s worth noting for sure! It’s like clean but worn and a warming scent I think could work across seasons?

First instinct, would I full size: yes! I love this scent, it smells like me and like a best friend’s mom’s home cooking in childhood that became part of one’s own core being. I can’t stop sniffing. It’s beautiful and delicious in an almost savory way! But I want to smell the rest of this house to see if I change my mind, while also wearing Hypnotic Nectar in different settings across time.

1r2bec1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingAlone/comments/1r2bec1/tired_of_doing_everything_for_myself/,Tired of doing everything for myself,"This post has probably been made a million times but I just need somewhere to vent. Lately I’ve been feeling extra tired and sad, mainly because I have to do a lot of things alone and for myself, which I’ve been used to doing for most of my life. I think what’s shifted is the fact that most of my friends now have partners who take care of them either financially, emotionally, physically, etc. and I haven’t been in a relationship in over 5 years now. I know a relationship isn’t everything and I shouldn’t want that just because my friends have someone, but it’d be nice to come home to someone who asks about my day, or have someone cook or clean for me especially on days when I’m feeling low energy. I’m feeling sad today and the fact that I’ll go home today after work and have no one to talk to about how I’m feeling or anyone to give me a hug makes me feel even more sad. Maybe I’m also burnt out, but everything has been feeling so heavy lately. Having to work full-time, pay bills, clean, cook, do laundry, fix my car, just doing general adult things all by myself has been so exhausting lately and I just want someone to take care of me for once. It could be something so small, like taking out the trash for me, buying me a coffee, even just holding me while I vent or cry. I think about my friends and every one of them has someone that can do that for them, and it makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me because I haven’t been able to find that in so long. I’m just tired and I wish there was someone here who could help me every now and then. ",2,1770848005.0,LivingAlone,5,1.0,False

We can go on a walk, or we can also not go on one. We can stay here and snuggle up at home on Sunday morning, or we can take the kiddo out and get donuts and coffee. Most days, I just don't have a desire to do anything in particular. If I did, it would make life much easier.

A lot of times I just want to sit down and supervise the kid and/or play with her, but outside of that, do nothing else. When I'm presented with options or different obligations I have to choose from, it stresses me the hell out.

This is so annoying. Anybody else have the same issue?",3,1770847903.0,daddit,2,1.0,False

Fragrance House: alloy studio -

“an experimental fragrance house.

based in NYC, the alloy studio creates perfumes and scented goods that feel like an extension of your style. we utilize beauty, fashion, and setting to tell stories through scent. our perfumes are made for invisible glamour. they can be your statement piece, or your armor. 

house codes

we use perfume to subvert, redefine, and glamorize. 

we use rare ingredients of the highest caliber, with a quality over quantity practice. our fragrances are hand batched and bottled in house, in nyc. 

our fragrances are generously dosed and considered ""eau de parfum"" or ""parfum"".

collaboration with artists, craftsmen, and creative talent is always our way. 

our fragrances are vegan & cruelty free.”

On the vision: “In our line, silver and gold respectively represent the spirit of collaboration and yin and yang between my partner and I. As we were creating the alloy studio together, we wanted to reflect our individual tastes and imaginations which resulted in the division of gold and silver. Gold represents my outlook on perfumery, often featuring a sense of ethereality and richness. Silver represents Eddie’s desires in perfume, featuring subversive, experimental concepts and ideas. These two elements form an alloy, something beautiful made through combination.”

scene: picking luminescent flowers and herbs in a secluded forest. a glamorously adorned shaman prepares you a drink made of crushed herbs and flowers. they promise you beauty and abundance if you accept it...”

Gender: unisex

Notes - “hypnotic nectar evokes an encounter with a den in a beautifully overgrown forest. there are no signs of life other than strangely luminous florals and fungi. 

the den is inhabited by an abnormally glamorous shaman dressed in fabulous wooden jewelry. they welcome you warmly with a bitter botanical potion instead of tea or coffee. the shaman promises you the beverage will bring enlightenment and abundance. as you sip, you notice a luminescent glow coming from your chest, and your fingers begin to flower…

First wear impression: very first whiff I like this one! It goes on like ramen straight from the bottle - possibly the mushroom and herbs but the dry down after just a minute is fantastic. Very floral to me! Lots of earthiness and a little spice like the broth of pho but in a good way I promise, it’s so comforting. I love this scent, it smells so good while also being interesting. I find it fascinating how the florals do read yellow, and yet despite being floral it does give unisex. Though it may lean the direction the wearer presents, so for me it doesn’t feel unfeminine! My partner mentioned it (almost? I forget what he said) smells like cologne, but I disagree! It’s worth noting for sure! It’s like clean but worn and a warming scent I think could work across seasons?

First instinct, would I full size: yes! I love this scent, it smells like me and like a best friend’s mom’s home cooking in childhood that became part of one’s own core being. I can’t stop sniffing. It’s beautiful and delicious in an almost savory way! But I want to smell the rest of this house to see if I change my mind, while also wearing Hypnotic Nectar in different settings across time.

Was really indecisive about where - was hoping to try a city in Europe (eg Switzerland) but it didn’t work out. Was really tired of the same old Boston/ the extreme weather and also not as much activities especially involving nature.

found myself planning vacations just to get away and waiting for the next one.

An opportunity presented itself this summer and my husband got a job offer in SD. We had visited before and we’re excited for a new city with better weather, better food, better life style.

We moved in Sept and we’ve been SO disappointed and are counting down untill the lease is up so we can move back to Boston.

I miss Boston’s walkability, good bakeries and bread, liveliness. I miss the people. I miss our friends and neighbors and community. I miss being able to walk to grab a coffee at our favorite cafe and then dropping by a yoga class before heading home. Lots of events close by to check out. I miss jumping on the T and going into downtown no problem or taking a reasonably priced uber.

SD- nice weather, nice beaches but feels so socially dead and sleepy! It’s not walkable nor is it accessible (no subway system) and Ubers are INSANELY expensive so you have to drive everywhere which means I can only go out if my husband is home from work and I have the car.  I hate that ever have to drive all the time for every little errand. The food isn’t that great either! Everyone and their mom actually avoids downtown here so it’s not really a thing to go hang out there…

The weather doesn’t make up for all the downgrades.

I feel like SD is a giant suburb.",4,1770847803.0,SameGrassButGreener,3,0.83,False
1r2bb4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/sabrinateenagewitch/comments/1r2bb4p/just_finished_watching_the_show_thoughts_spoilers/,Just finished watching the show thoughts! (spoilers),"To be honest, I'm not sure if I'd ever seen the WHOLE show before. I didn't remember any plotlines past high school, so I think I must have stopped watching it before at that point. But now that I've seen the whole show, overall, I liked the show a lot! The magic was fun, the incantations were clever, the clothing was always fabulous, the spellbook was awesome, and I really liked the blanket in her bedroom because it fit the show perfectly!  
          
  
  
&nbsp;

Even in its worst moments, the character of Sabrina is so bright, upbeat, hopeful. And Salem remained funny throughout the show. He got the best jokes, had cute funny costumes, and the switches between puppets/real cats were fun to spot. I liked how often throughout the series, Salem was the one helping Sabrina learn new magic. And it was so cute when he'd jump into her window in the college years to check on her! Harvey was such a nice character and the PERFECT love interest/match for Sabrina. Libby was a PERFECT foil to Sabrina. She was smart and had real depth to her. Like the episode where she was a nerd, or the one where Sabrina had to put together the Libby puzzle and found out how similar they really were. UGh, I wish that'd led to an eventual friendship! I liked Gordie a lot too. I wish they'd have done more with him! If those two had been Sabrina's roommates, I'd have been much happier.  
          
  
  
&nbsp;

I liked Mrs. Quick, who was so nice. I wish they'd have kept her on somehow. I liked how her and Sabrina matched as nice hopefuls. I liked Mr. Kraft's humor and sometimes I wondered if Martin Mull improvised some of it. Mull is a comedic legend. but I was glad when Mr. Kraft left the show. He was really kind of an evil character and Zelda was a witch (haha) for ever wanting to seriously date or someday marry an authority figure who was such a bully to her niece. Also, speaking of witches, Barbara Eden was so funny, yet also scarily powerful in all her episodes.  
    
  
  
&nbsp; 
 
Problems? The show changed way too much! I think every season had major cast and/or setting changes and they were usually for the worse. Sabrina's first BFF Jenny was a very unique character/actress. She had a way about her that seemed genuine? Valerie could be funny sometimes, but she felt pouty all the time. I feel like Roxie later on was an attempt to kind of fit a similar alternative character archetype like Jenny, but it didn't work as good for me at least. Similarly, Morgan felt like a worse version of Libby's archetype. She was stuck-up, but she wasn't written as being smart. I will give credit though, there were a couple episodes where Morgan had some depth. I liked her Christmas at home episode a lot and the actress Elisa Donovan did a great job of acting in that one. The way she'd nervously fix her hair, kinda cover her ears, or how she sat on the bench in like a stressed-out fetal position. Similar to the Libby puzzle, I wish the writers had continued on with that path! Instead, they wrote Morgan dumber. To be clear, I don't dislike the actress! I watch Clueless all the time!  
   
  
  
&nbsp;  

As for the last roommate, Miles? I liked the actor's voice because it was kind of unique, and I liked the setup of him being into paranormal stuff. But he didn't have much depth. To be fair, a couple of earlier season characters were also terribly written: Brad and Dreama. Brad is like, why would you introduce a character whose only purpose on the show is to be revolted by the main character? I know the magical why, but the watching why is like, it was such a strange decision. He wasn't funny or clever like Libby. He just hated Sabrina without really knowing why. I feel there's an interesting setup there that wasn't properly followed-through on. And Dreama was in a few episodes as a clumsy witch, then she wasn't on the show anymore. There were a lot or issues with things not being followed up on. I liked the Quizmaster and thankfully, he was on it a lot and had impact. Katrina and Jezebelda weren't on a lot, but they were so fun! Amanda is one character who actually got better as the show went on. It was funny when she kept purposely appearing in clouds of smoke! And in the later seasons, it was funny seeing how much Emily Hart looked like a way taller version of her short sister Melissa!  
              
  
  
&nbsp;

More problems! Josh was so terrible! He had such a negative energy about him in like every episode. I didn't laugh at anything he said because I hated his character so much. He yelled at Sabrina a lot and he talked down to her. I don't know why she stayed with him for so long. I think he was my least favorite character on the show, but I'm not 100% sure. Everyone at Scorch ranged from forgettable to AWFUL. As I watched the final season, I kind of wondered who was worse: Josh or Aaron. I think Aaron's choice made me dislike him less. So for me, Josh was the WORST.  
   
  
  
&nbsp;

I liked the Aunts, but I wish their storylines were better. The actresses were 100% locked-in, but their storylines could be pretty bland for actual witches. Even in the early seasons, they had a storyline of how they couldn't open jars. Then the clock shop was kind of like OK? but Hilda at the coffee shop was kind of annoying and it gave Josh more screentime. I liked the idea of Zelda as a professor, but they didn't do a good job of writing for her in the college years. I felt really sad at the end how the aunts were written off. Especially Zelda's write-off which was so sudden and since we'd never see her again, disrespectful. It didn't feel like the show anymore without them. It felt so OFF seeing Morgan & Roxie living in their house all of a sudden! Also, a weird thing with the house for me is I thought the painting talked a LOT more. Like, I hadn't watched the show at all in years, and I went in thinking the painting was like a regular character. But now I think she only talked twice the entire series? I don't know why she stuck in my head so much. It's weird.  
       
  
  
&nbsp;

The main problem with the show for me was the writing got worse. All the main side characters from early seasons beat the later seasons by far. Not only for aforementioned problems, but also the tone of the show seemed to become meaner. There was a last season episode where Sabrina cut Salem's head off! WTF! Having said that, I did like some aspects of season 7 more than the previous few seasons. Season 7 had a lot of magic in it, which other late-seasons were lacking. I especially liked the circus one with Peter Scolari, the Cyrano de Sabrina one, and the Fates. The Fates were so funny, I wish they had been reoccurring villains.  
  
  
  
&nbsp;

I think next time I watch the show, I'll watch a more curated version of it. Shows back then had much longer seasons, so there's still a lot of great episodes to watch. The first few seasons made me feel happier and more hopeful. I loved the opening theme the best in the early seasons because of the costumes/funny one-liners. A lot of the later seasons of the show made me feel kind of sad or annoyed, like, with Josh being so terrible, or Salem being thrown around all the time. Also, the joke-writing in the later seasons felt more sitcom-y, like stuff you'd hear on any show. And for some reason, the amount of magic on the show went WAY down over time. I'm not sure why the show got retooled so much. I thought it was a very popular show? Either way, I do still like the show overall and of course, this is all just my opinion. I still liked the show and wouldn't have written all this if I didn't like the show.",2,1770847799.0,sabrinateenagewitch,0,1.0,False

Jerry and Michael were already in the shed, and they were arguing as usual. 

“Why do you always have to be so negative all the time?” 

Michael bit into his meatball sub, squeezing the sides so tightly that I traced the flying glob of tomato sauce flying through the air. His teeth chewed on the hunks of meat in between buns of white bread, biting into the brown stained with sauce, some getting into his beard. “Awl I shed wash he probably doeshn’t dream ‘bout anything.” He swallowed. “What’s your deal?” 

Jerry’s face was equally as red as the tomato sauce. “Why do I have to be so negative–?” He turned to me. “Laura. Back me up here–” 

“Hi, Laura,” Michael interrupted. 

Jerry closed his eyes for a solid four seconds. Keeping his back to Michael, he ran a hand through his balding blond hair, pressing the palm tight against his pale forehead. It reminded me of an ironing board smoothing out the wrinkles on a crusty t-shirt. Jerry opened his eyes. “As I was saying–” 

“What’s up, Mike?” I responded. 

Jerry stomped his foot against the ground. “Fuck! Fuck! God fucking… would you just let me get one fucking word in? I swear to God, I’ll–” He was interrupted again as Mike dropped his sub to the floor, striding over to Jerry in two efficient steps, then using his own boot to crush down on Jerry’s stomping foot. Before Jerry could yell any further, Make clamped a hand over Jerry’s mouth, smearing a little sauce on Jerry’s round face. Mike held up a finger to his own mouth, shushing him.

I looked at Mike’s alarmed expression, then towards the window of the shack. 

The supply shack was about the size of a small garage. Big for a shed. Huge for a shed out here. Definitely fine enough for our purposes. It was made of pieces of rusted tin, hammered together to form four walls once painted a deep green. An automatic light hung outside the small door on the far side of the room, though its bulb had been removed long ago. The wall facing the street had small windows near the ceiling, allowing some sunlight to drift onto the concrete floor. The floor sloped downward against that same wall, more cracks and warps contributing to the dirtstained concrete until it reached a near vertical angle, stopping when it reached the very foundation of the wall. 

We waited in silence, Mike slowly removing his hands away from Jerry’s face. I crept over to the corner, grabbing a roll of paper towels from the carpenter’s table. While I scooped up the splattered sandwich, Mike creaked the door open. We all collectively grimaced, covering our dark-adjusted eyes. A gust of wind blew the short black hair on his forward, plastering it to his pale forehead. It tickled his beard, still stained with tomato sauce. Underneath his red baseball cap, his brown eyes scanned back and forth, then he stepped outside, inching the door shut behind him. 

Jerry leaned in to whisper: “I’m just saying, Laura, don’t you think Bob here… like, don’t you think he dreams?” 

“Stop talking, Jerry,” I replied, my eyes glued to the door. If I could will my ears to perk like an animal’s, I would.

He finally shut his mouth. 

We could hear Mike walking outside, his feet echoing off the driveway. He walked once around the shed, then paused at the door. He began to open it, his shadow spilling into the unilluminated room, then stopped, apparently reconsidering. He closed the door again, walking once more around the shed. I even heard him walk down the driveway, towards the street out front, before finally returning, definitively closing the door shut behind him as he re-entered the shed. 

Mike took a toothpick out from his green-gray duck chore coat, jaw flexing as he chewed on the tip. 

I gently placed the sub remains inside a trash bag, then tied it shut, setting it down next to the door so no one would forget to take it with them later. 

Jerry appeared unfazed. “Anyway,” he continued. “I was just saying that I think Bob, here–” 

“I thought we agreed on Stewart,” Michael grunted. 

“Fine. Stewart. Don’t you think he dreams?”

I looked at Stewart’s operating table. The shiny metal slab took up most of the room, sitting on locked wheels and holding up the body of the comatose man. He had deep brown hair, parted to the right. Stubble had grown over his tan face, and his narrow eyes darted frantically around his surroundings behind closed eyelids. I moved closer, shifting his body a little away from the edge of the table. Recoiling as I got near his diaper, I turned my nose away. 

Moving as quickly as I could, I took a syringe from my left pocket, and a vial of clear liquid from the other. I poked the needle through the lid, filling the syringe to the brim. I tapped the side, the metal *plinking* against my fingernail, as I cleared away the excess drips. Nodding to Jerry, he wordlessly crossed over to my side of the table, recoiling at the smell, too, as he held down Stewart’s arm to keep it as still as possible. Mike handed me a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol, and I swabbed the skin over a twisting, blue vein. Leaning in close, I sunk the needle into the skin at an angle, letting the tip enter Stewart’s bloodstream. 

I looked at Jerry and Michael as I drained the needle into him. “Isn’t the whole point that he does dream?” 

Jerry wrung his hands. “THANK YOU!” 

Michael rolled his eyes. “I meant, I don’t think he’s conscious of his dreams. Like, isn’t there a whole study that says you always dream when you sleep, but you pretty much never remember the majority of them?” 

“What difference does that make?” Jerry spluttered. “If he’s dreaming, he’s dreaming! I swear, you’re just disagreeing with me because it– it pleases you to be nihilistic. You always have to have the opposite opinion of me. Like, Laura, I think Stewart’s dreaming of a field of butterflies, and Michael…” 

“I think he’s experiencing what it’s like to be in the womb. Just some floating spirit not even aware of what the hell’s going on.” Michael finished. A shadow crossed his face. “But I’m not a nihilist.” 

I slid the needle out and placed it in a water basin. Then I picked up the copy of the Bible sitting on the shelf by the rusting metal door. I whacked both of them on the head with it before they could react. 

Jerry rubbed his head. “Hey!” 

“One of you needs to change his diaper. I did it yesterday.” 

Jerry and Mike looked at each other. They held out their hands for rock, paper, scissors. Mike was rock, Jerry was scissors. 

“Best of three?” Jerry tried. Mike shoved a clean diaper into his arms. Jerry sighed. He snapped on a pair of medical gloves and covered his face with a mask. I reached into the sink, squirting dish soap onto a yellow sponge before carefully running it over the needle. I kept the water pressure at a low, wishing again that I had access to better disinfectants. Michael fished his smartphone out of his pocket, turning the volume down to one before selecting an app that was playing the news. 

Over the quiet trickle of running water, I could just barely make out the reporter’s voice coming out from the phone’s speaker. “More bodies in Jordan as alleged border disputes with The United Arab Emirates escalates to an unprecedented–” Mike swiped, switching to a different news station. “--Twenty-three Texas school children dead in Tentuskiville shooting–” Swipe. “--Kremlin officials deny ethnic cleansing allegations made by six members of the U.N. Security Council in regards to the Russian controlled state of–” Swipe. “--Refugees escaping in droves as more of the Mediterranean coastline is swallowed by rising sea levels. When asked if any cities in the United States would be made sanctuaries, the president responded–”

Mike stared at his reflection in the black screen of his phone. Jerry sniffed, eyes frozen on Stewart. He whispered something under his breath. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Piece of shit,” He said again, a little louder. Jerry threw the diaper into the bag, then laid trembling hands on the edge of the operating table. “Piece of shit!” He started shaking it violently, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with red. 

“Jerry!” I shouted. Mike and I locked eyes, and we rushed to Jerry’s side, tackling him to the floor. Jerry was still thrashing violently, teeth gritted and palms sweating. Mike squeezed his arm around his mouth, trying to stop him from making any noise. 

“Shh!” He hissed.

I held Jerry’s other arm down, pressing it against the cold, uneven concrete floor. Then he kicked his foot, hitting the leg of the table. It began to roll across the room, down a steady downwards slope. 

We immediately dropped Jerry, rushing to intercept the speeding table. I grabbed its side, grunting as I tried to keep the metal slab with the heavier man on top from sliding any further. Mike dashed to the other side, pulling it with his arms. Stewart’s body slid precariously to the edge, almost rolling over on top of me. I reached my arms up, steadying the man. We rolled the table back into place, Michael edging Stewart back to his position in the center. 

This time, it was my turn to check outside. 

The sun beat down on me as soon as I stepped out the door. I squinted, trying to see anything past the glare of the day. Even though the sun was low in the sky, there were no houses to block it from blinding me. I began to slowly circle the shed, looking around me at the miles of the same old overgrown, abandoned development project. It was the outline of a neighborhood, with sun-stained sidewalks, cracked driveways, and empty foundations. There were no cars, though. No wires, no telephone poles, streetlamps, houses, or thankfully, people. The shed itself sat on an identical lot filled with weeds and scattered bushes. My guess was that this belonged to someone before the land even started development. And it was still here after. 

I wasn’t as paranoid as Mike. I elected to only walk around the shed once. In the far distance, beyond the concrete nothingness, I could see the grove of trees where we parked our cars, though the vehicles themselves were hidden from my line of sight. If anyone had heard our noises, they were either hiding over there, or they weren’t here at all. There was no possible way to sneak up on us in this place. 

That didn’t stop us from being careful. 

When I came back inside, Jerry was still on the floor, hugging his knees. He looked tearfully at Mike and I. “Is he still asleep?” 

I approached the operating table. Stewart’s eyes were still closed, still rapidly moving underneath his eyelids. I walked around, gently gripping his head as I used my other hand to lay two fingers on his neck. I nodded to Mike, who raised his arm, checking his watch. I felt the thumping of Stewart’s heart, and I closed my eyes, counting in my head. Jerry drew in a long breath, then got up, moving towards the basin, where he picked up the needle, holding the bottle at the ready. 

The watch beeped. Mike looked up at me. 

“Thirty-nine BPM. Still asleep.”

Mike breathed a sigh of relief. Jerry slumped over, holding his head in his hands. 

I pulled up a stool, releasing a long exhale through my nose. I sat down, letting my shoulders sag. Even as my posture relaxed, I couldn’t help but let my head trail up, looking past the operating table with the still-asleep Stewart, past Jerry, who was lying on the floor and staring straight up at the water-damaged ceiling, and past Mike, who was finishing putting on the diaper. My eyes fell past all of them and onto the space just above the doorway to the shed, to the message scrawled messily in red paint. The one I forced myself to look at every single day.

WE ARE BETTER OFF WITH HIM ASLEEP. 

# JULY 12. 7:33 PM. 

I muttered a goodbye to Mike and Jerry, then I started the four block walk to my car. Even though it was past seven, it was still ninety-six degrees out.  I rubbed sunscreen on my face as I walked, shoes slapping against the sidewalk pavement. My arm brushed the dead bush that lay at the end of the walkway to the shed, then I turned right, onto the street. Cicadas drowned out the sounds of the birds in the trees. I looked behind, and saw Jerry leaning against the shed wall, brushing a sweaty strand of hair out from his face. Even though we both had nightshifts, he wouldn’t leave for at least another thirty minutes. It was important to stagger our departures. 

The sun wasn’t radiating light over the abandoned lots anymore. The gray shade of the evening permeated the empty development project, now. My shadow, split into two, blackened the already black concrete. I reached into my purse, feeling the cool lenses of the sunglasses tossed inside. Even when I was here in the middle of the day, I never liked wearing them out here. The dark tint felt like it was hiding someone. Crouching in the bushes, waiting for me to be all alone. A someone that had somehow walked all the way out here to the center of nothingness, avoided all of our regular checks outside, whose purpose was to keep themselves impossibly hidden, watching us. Waiting. 

Our cars were scattered around the lone patch of grass amongst the oak trees. Mike’s black SUV, my own white sedan, and Jerry’s shining metal cybertruck. Real inconspicuous. 

I opened the driver’s side door to my own car, turning the key in the ignition and immediately switching on the AC. I closed the door, waiting outside as the car cooled. Whatever hellish temperature it was out here, it was always going to be twenty degrees higher in the car. My phone rang, and I immediately picked it up. 

Mike’s voice sounded tired. “Ready to keep going?” 

“Put me on with him.” 

“Alright.” I heard shuffling, and then Mike said, sounding further away: “Go ahead.” 

I tried to put on the calm, reassuring voice I used with the residents at Shady Grove. “Hi, Stewart. Can you hear me?” 

There was no answer, as expected. I heard his quiet breathing through the speaker. Mike must’ve placed the phone pretty close to his face today. As if the centimeter difference to his brain would make matter. I thought it would be best to make it seem like we were having a normal conversation, even if it was one-sided. If he could hear me in there, it would be good to establish a relationship of trust. 

“You’re speaking to Laura, right now. Are you having a pleasant dream?” 

I let my question hang in the air. Sandwiching my phone between my shoulder and ear, I fished out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth as I got out the matches. The first one was a dud. I dropped the spent match on the ground, digging it in with my heel, then realized what I had done. 

“Shit.” I kneeled down, trying not to get my uniform dirty. 

“Laura?” Mike’s voice was still far away. “All good?” 

“Yup. Yeah, Mike,” I said, grabbing the match from the grass. I opened the door, sliding into the driver’s seat as I flicked the match into a plastic bag tied around the gear stick. Connecting the call to the vehicle’s bluetooth, I started pulling out of my parking spot.

“Stewart,” I continued. “I ask about your dream because I wanted to talk to you about something called lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? Instead of the foggy memory of your dream after you wake up, you can become aware of the dream while you’re… well, while you’re in it.” 

I backed out onto the road, swinging a left and accelerating. “And some people who lucid dream, like, who realize that they’re dreaming while they’re still in the dream, can actually control what happens in it. So you could do whatever you want, Stewart. You could fly. You could relive your childhood memories.” I checked my rearview mirror. “You could even talk… um, you could even talk…” 

I heard Mike breathe through his nose. “Laura, this isn’t going to work.” 

“Isn’t it worth trying?” I asked. 

“We’ve been doing this every single day. Aren’t you getting tired? God, I mean, I can hear it in your voice. What was that?” 

“It’s just hard, okay?” I snapped, not meaning to sound as irritable as my tone came out, but it’d been a long day, and it was just getting started. As usual. “This whole thing is crazy. Excuse me if it's a little hard to spit out.” 

Michael didn’t say anything. I mentally chided myself, watching the abandoned lots give away to the sight of the groundlevel freeway. We couldn’t let cracks form. Not now. Not after so long, and so little time left. 

I let ourselves sit in silence for a little while. The truth was, we had no idea if any of this was getting to Stewart. We thought that Stewart’s brain activity was normal. A patient in comatose might be able to hear communication from the outside world, depending on if their brain was still functioning as intended. It was impossible to tell for Stewart, except for the fact that he was still alive. Yeah, I could get basic tools like syringes from Shady Grove, but nothing close to something like an MRI machine. 

As I entered the highway, Mike’s voice resonated through the car. “Are we going to talk about Jerry?” 

 “What’s there to talk about?” 

“You know what.”

“It’s an emotional job, Mike.” 

“No, you get emotional. Jerry–”

“Excuse me?” I said, looking wide-eyed at the phone symbol on the car screen. 

“I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean, your behavior around this– mine, too– that’s normal. We’re bound to get a little stir-crazy from time-to-time, but we keep going, y’know? But stir-crazy is one thing. Going ape-shit on the guy that’s supposed to stay asleep no matter what is another.” 

I watched the light get lower in the sky as mist began to settle on the road. Luckily there were no cars around, but I found myself thankful that I had actually gotten my ass to the mechanic last week to get my low beams fixed. My talk with Mike was beginning to feel like a conversation I had with one of the residents. I forced my voice to be patient. “I’ve seen what we’re giving him in action. If a fraction of that is enough to lull a crazy old bitch to a gentle nap, Stewart wouldn’t wake for the end of the world with what he’s getting.” 

“It’s not just that. What if someone heard?” Mike replied. 

“Who’s going to hear?”

“You never know. Besides–” 

His voice said something loud, maybe urgent. But… what was that? There was something on the road in front me. A pair of white lights, two pinpricks much too small to belong to a car. They stared at me in the other lane as I loosened my foot on the gas. They shone through the fog, piercing through the rolling haze like the sun entering a cave. But this was cold. My eyes were unable to blink as I shivered uncontrollably. Stings of pain began to blot out my vision, tears streaming down my face. I felt the groans of the highway underneath me as I entered the lane separation, the vehicular concrete clawing at the hot rubber of my wheels telling me to turn back. 

The lights were eyes. Terrible, blinding eyes, the result of two needles taken to thick black construction paper and held in front of a brilliant lantern. And the fog was crawling into my car, tendrils of it seeping through the miniscule gap in my windows, foggy fingers groping from within the depths of the air conditioning vent, pure, frosty terror creeping from the crack in my windshield. My fingers burned with cold, feeling frozen to the steering wheel. But my arms slowly turned it. Creeping towards the black silhouette with the white eyes with sickening odyssean lust. 

The black silhouette was crouched, eyes boring into mine. Not even my very, very close headlights could illuminate their features. But I could see their current height well superseding my car. At least six feet tall. Like a shadow manifest. A cold, black shadow. The sky without stars. 

Turn back. Turn back. 

My vision cleared. I swung the wheel the opposite direction, almost snapping my arm with the force of my whiplash. The car squealed, and burning rubber filled my nose, making me gag. I slammed the gas, driving, driving. The fog was so thick. Mike was saying something, but the bluetooth was distorted. It cut off his sentences, leaving periods of silence intercut with hoarse, gasping breaths. 

“Mike,” I rasped, feeling like I needed to cough. “M–”

My car slammed into the broad trunk of a tree. My phone toppled from the cupholder, falling flat on the floor of the car and ending the call. My head slammed forward with the impact, hitting the steering wheel before my airbag activated. A shrill ringing filled my ears. For a second, I had to fight myself to stay awake. I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. I felt sick, vomit threatening to spill through my throat, simultaneously as my head throbbed. 

I sat up, ignoring the possible concussion I had sustained. I took a deep breath, slowly blinking to steady my vision. My windshield was cracked, well, even more than it already had been.  The hood of my car was crumpled like a tin can. 

“Fuck,” I whispered, stifling a sob. 

How the hell was I gonna afford a new car? My salary was already a fucking joke. I had bills to pay. Groceries to buy. And… 

Had that really happened? 

I turned the car off, not that it really mattered anymore. Pushing the airbag out of the way, I groped around the dark car for my phone. Picking it up, I ran my thumb along its shattered screen. At least it still turned on. I thought about what I would do next. As far as I knew, there weren’t any other cars on the road, and definitely no speed cameras. No one had seen what had just happened. I hung up an incoming call from Mike. Time to get out and ring AAA. 

I reached for the door handle, then stopped. There were noises on the roof of the car. 

They were loud, banging one after the other, in slow, rhythmic succession. It sounded like footsteps. I waited to hear them hop onto the back of the trunk, then onto the road. I even craned my neck, wincing at a bruise that had developed right below my ear. But I didn’t see them. In fact, the footsteps didn’t stop. They circled on top of the car. 

My heart began to pound, and I released my breath, not realizing I had been holding it. I absorbed every minute detail of my car. The white cushion of the airbag protruded from the steering wheel. An old coffee cup had fallen to the ground, cold liquid dripping onto the carpeted floor. In the back row was my black duffel bag, inside it was some extra vials of what we fed Stewart, and his IV bag. We planned to transition him to the drip diet once we got some more supplies. For now, we did our best by forcing blended food down his throat. Mike always had a crash bag ready if he started choking. 

I looked out the back window, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the perfect dark. Waiting to see whoever was on my roof appear on the other side. 

My phone rang. 

The blue lit up the entire car. I saw Mike’s name appear like a prehistoric blaze of fire. I gasped as the beating of my chest skipped a hundred years. I heard a tap and I looked and I saw the black silhouette of someone with white glowing eyes peering down at me perched on the roof of my car penetrating and looking into my head with curiosity and unknowability and something that felt like the cold pangs of hunger jab into the inside of my spine. My scream drowned out the phone’s ringtone and the stranger shot their head back. I heard a slam, saw my car’s roof crunch downwards, felt myself close my eyes. 

I knew it could only have been a few seconds later when I opened them. The phone was still ringing. I looked out the window. Nothing. I listened. The roof was quiet. Dazed, I groped around on the floor, taking a few tries before my trembling hands picked the phone up. I slid the answer bar to the right. 

“Laura? Laura, are you there?” Mike sounded panicked. 

I swallowed. “Y-” My voice came out too quiet. “Yeah. Yeah.” Instinctively, I felt my pulse. 

“Laura, I swear to god I fucking saw–” He cut himself off. “Wait, what happened? Are you okay? Did I hear something on your end? You hung up on me.” 

“Um… yeah.” I tried to keep myself calm, focusing on counting the pulse rate. “I got into an accident.” 

“Oh, my god. Are you okay?” Mike’s voice became flat. Neutral. “I’m going to need you to answer my questions for me, okay, Laura?” 

“Oh my god, Mike.” Ten over one hundred. “I’m okay.” 

His voice was calm, but stern. “Are you bleeding?” 

I checked myself again. Just the bruise on my neck. A scrape on my forehead that had already scabbed over. “No.” 

“Was there anyone else in the car with you?” 

“Mike! It was obviously just me!” I didn’t mean to snap at him. Again. I was on edge. The precipice of a razorblade. 

“I’m trying to get a clear picture, right now, Laura. That’s all. Do you feel dizzy? Is your vision blurry?” 

I blinked. “I think I have a small concussion. I’m okay, really.” 

He sighed. “No, you’re not. You need to get that checked out, right away.” 

“Mike! What the fuck happened? Why did you call me?” I squinted, trying to physically recall what happened before my accident with the man in the fog. “Did I hear you yell?”

He hesitated. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I thought I saw Stewart’s lips move.” 

I sat up in my seat. 

“Did you catch what he was saying?” 

“Laura, I don’t know. I don’t know what I saw. I’m more concerned about you.” 

“Mike. What did he say?” 

He took an even longer time to answer. When he finally did, I sat in my car for a long time, still by the side of the highway, watching the shadows. Counting numbers in my head. Thinking. 

“I thought… I thought I saw him mouth ‘help’.”

Jerry and Michael were already in the shed, and they were arguing as usual. 

“Why do you always have to be so negative all the time?” 

Michael bit into his meatball sub, squeezing the sides so tightly that I traced the flying glob of tomato sauce flying through the air. His teeth chewed on the hunks of meat in between buns of white bread, biting into the brown stained with sauce, some getting into his beard. “Awl I shed wash he probably doeshn’t dream ‘bout anything.” He swallowed. “What’s your deal?” 

Jerry’s face was equally as red as the tomato sauce. “Why do I have to be so negative–?” He turned to me. “Laura. Back me up here–” 

“Hi, Laura,” Michael interrupted. 

Jerry closed his eyes for a solid four seconds. Keeping his back to Michael, he ran a hand through his balding blond hair, pressing the palm tight against his pale forehead. It reminded me of an ironing board smoothing out the wrinkles on a crusty t-shirt. Jerry opened his eyes. “As I was saying–” 

“What’s up, Mike?” I responded. 

Jerry stomped his foot against the ground. “Fuck! Fuck! God fucking… would you just let me get one fucking word in? I swear to God, I’ll–” He was interrupted again as Mike dropped his sub to the floor, striding over to Jerry in two efficient steps, then using his own boot to crush down on Jerry’s stomping foot. Before Jerry could yell any further, Make clamped a hand over Jerry’s mouth, smearing a little sauce on Jerry’s round face. Mike held up a finger to his own mouth, shushing him.

I looked at Mike’s alarmed expression, then towards the window of the shack. 

The supply shack was about the size of a small garage. Big for a shed. Huge for a shed out here. Definitely fine enough for our purposes. It was made of pieces of rusted tin, hammered together to form four walls once painted a deep green. An automatic light hung outside the small door on the far side of the room, though its bulb had been removed long ago. The wall facing the street had small windows near the ceiling, allowing some sunlight to drift onto the concrete floor. The floor sloped downward against that same wall, more cracks and warps contributing to the dirtstained concrete until it reached a near vertical angle, stopping when it reached the very foundation of the wall. 

We waited in silence, Mike slowly removing his hands away from Jerry’s face. I crept over to the corner, grabbing a roll of paper towels from the carpenter’s table. While I scooped up the splattered sandwich, Mike creaked the door open. We all collectively grimaced, covering our dark-adjusted eyes. A gust of wind blew the short black hair on his forward, plastering it to his pale forehead. It tickled his beard, still stained with tomato sauce. Underneath his red baseball cap, his brown eyes scanned back and forth, then he stepped outside, inching the door shut behind him. 

Jerry leaned in to whisper: “I’m just saying, Laura, don’t you think Bob here… like, don’t you think he dreams?” 

“Stop talking, Jerry,” I replied, my eyes glued to the door. If I could will my ears to perk like an animal’s, I would.

He finally shut his mouth. 

We could hear Mike walking outside, his feet echoing off the driveway. He walked once around the shed, then paused at the door. He began to open it, his shadow spilling into the unilluminated room, then stopped, apparently reconsidering. He closed the door again, walking once more around the shed. I even heard him walk down the driveway, towards the street out front, before finally returning, definitively closing the door shut behind him as he re-entered the shed. 

Mike took a toothpick out from his green-gray duck chore coat, jaw flexing as he chewed on the tip. 

I gently placed the sub remains inside a trash bag, then tied it shut, setting it down next to the door so no one would forget to take it with them later. 

Jerry appeared unfazed. “Anyway,” he continued. “I was just saying that I think Bob, here–” 

“I thought we agreed on Stewart,” Michael grunted. 

“Fine. Stewart. Don’t you think he dreams?”

I looked at Stewart’s operating table. The shiny metal slab took up most of the room, sitting on locked wheels and holding up the body of the comatose man. He had deep brown hair, parted to the right. Stubble had grown over his tan face, and his narrow eyes darted frantically around his surroundings behind closed eyelids. I moved closer, shifting his body a little away from the edge of the table. Recoiling as I got near his diaper, I turned my nose away. 

Moving as quickly as I could, I took a syringe from my left pocket, and a vial of clear liquid from the other. I poked the needle through the lid, filling the syringe to the brim. I tapped the side, the metal *plinking* against my fingernail, as I cleared away the excess drips. Nodding to Jerry, he wordlessly crossed over to my side of the table, recoiling at the smell, too, as he held down Stewart’s arm to keep it as still as possible. Mike handed me a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol, and I swabbed the skin over a twisting, blue vein. Leaning in close, I sunk the needle into the skin at an angle, letting the tip enter Stewart’s bloodstream. 

I looked at Jerry and Michael as I drained the needle into him. “Isn’t the whole point that he does dream?” 

Jerry wrung his hands. “THANK YOU!” 

Michael rolled his eyes. “I meant, I don’t think he’s conscious of his dreams. Like, isn’t there a whole study that says you always dream when you sleep, but you pretty much never remember the majority of them?” 

“What difference does that make?” Jerry spluttered. “If he’s dreaming, he’s dreaming! I swear, you’re just disagreeing with me because it– it pleases you to be nihilistic. You always have to have the opposite opinion of me. Like, Laura, I think Stewart’s dreaming of a field of butterflies, and Michael…” 

“I think he’s experiencing what it’s like to be in the womb. Just some floating spirit not even aware of what the hell’s going on.” Michael finished. A shadow crossed his face. “But I’m not a nihilist.” 

I slid the needle out and placed it in a water basin. Then I picked up the copy of the Bible sitting on the shelf by the rusting metal door. I whacked both of them on the head with it before they could react. 

Jerry rubbed his head. “Hey!” 

“One of you needs to change his diaper. I did it yesterday.” 

Jerry and Mike looked at each other. They held out their hands for rock, paper, scissors. Mike was rock, Jerry was scissors. 

“Best of three?” Jerry tried. Mike shoved a clean diaper into his arms. Jerry sighed. He snapped on a pair of medical gloves and covered his face with a mask. I reached into the sink, squirting dish soap onto a yellow sponge before carefully running it over the needle. I kept the water pressure at a low, wishing again that I had access to better disinfectants. Michael fished his smartphone out of his pocket, turning the volume down to one before selecting an app that was playing the news. 

Over the quiet trickle of running water, I could just barely make out the reporter’s voice coming out from the phone’s speaker. “More bodies in Jordan as alleged border disputes with The United Arab Emirates escalates to an unprecedented–” Mike swiped, switching to a different news station. “--Twenty-three Texas school children dead in Tentuskiville shooting–” Swipe. “--Kremlin officials deny ethnic cleansing allegations made by six members of the U.N. Security Council in regards to the Russian controlled state of–” Swipe. “--Refugees escaping in droves as more of the Mediterranean coastline is swallowed by rising sea levels. When asked if any cities in the United States would be made sanctuaries, the president responded–”

Mike stared at his reflection in the black screen of his phone. Jerry sniffed, eyes frozen on Stewart. He whispered something under his breath. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Piece of shit,” He said again, a little louder. Jerry threw the diaper into the bag, then laid trembling hands on the edge of the operating table. “Piece of shit!” He started shaking it violently, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with red. 

“Jerry!” I shouted. Mike and I locked eyes, and we rushed to Jerry’s side, tackling him to the floor. Jerry was still thrashing violently, teeth gritted and palms sweating. Mike squeezed his arm around his mouth, trying to stop him from making any noise. 

“Shh!” He hissed.

I held Jerry’s other arm down, pressing it against the cold, uneven concrete floor. Then he kicked his foot, hitting the leg of the table. It began to roll across the room, down a steady downwards slope. 

We immediately dropped Jerry, rushing to intercept the speeding table. I grabbed its side, grunting as I tried to keep the metal slab with the heavier man on top from sliding any further. Mike dashed to the other side, pulling it with his arms. Stewart’s body slid precariously to the edge, almost rolling over on top of me. I reached my arms up, steadying the man. We rolled the table back into place, Michael edging Stewart back to his position in the center. 

This time, it was my turn to check outside. 

The sun beat down on me as soon as I stepped out the door. I squinted, trying to see anything past the glare of the day. Even though the sun was low in the sky, there were no houses to block it from blinding me. I began to slowly circle the shed, looking around me at the miles of the same old overgrown, abandoned development project. It was the outline of a neighborhood, with sun-stained sidewalks, cracked driveways, and empty foundations. There were no cars, though. No wires, no telephone poles, streetlamps, houses, or thankfully, people. The shed itself sat on an identical lot filled with weeds and scattered bushes. My guess was that this belonged to someone before the land even started development. And it was still here after. 

I wasn’t as paranoid as Mike. I elected to only walk around the shed once. In the far distance, beyond the concrete nothingness, I could see the grove of trees where we parked our cars, though the vehicles themselves were hidden from my line of sight. If anyone had heard our noises, they were either hiding over there, or they weren’t here at all. There was no possible way to sneak up on us in this place. 

That didn’t stop us from being careful. 

When I came back inside, Jerry was still on the floor, hugging his knees. He looked tearfully at Mike and I. “Is he still asleep?” 

I approached the operating table. Stewart’s eyes were still closed, still rapidly moving underneath his eyelids. I walked around, gently gripping his head as I used my other hand to lay two fingers on his neck. I nodded to Mike, who raised his arm, checking his watch. I felt the thumping of Stewart’s heart, and I closed my eyes, counting in my head. Jerry drew in a long breath, then got up, moving towards the basin, where he picked up the needle, holding the bottle at the ready. 

The watch beeped. Mike looked up at me. 

“Thirty-nine BPM. Still asleep.”

Mike breathed a sigh of relief. Jerry slumped over, holding his head in his hands. 

I pulled up a stool, releasing a long exhale through my nose. I sat down, letting my shoulders sag. Even as my posture relaxed, I couldn’t help but let my head trail up, looking past the operating table with the still-asleep Stewart, past Jerry, who was lying on the floor and staring straight up at the water-damaged ceiling, and past Mike, who was finishing putting on the diaper. My eyes fell past all of them and onto the space just above the doorway to the shed, to the message scrawled messily in red paint. The one I forced myself to look at every single day.

WE ARE BETTER OFF WITH HIM ASLEEP. 

# JULY 12. 7:33 PM. 

I muttered a goodbye to Mike and Jerry, then I started the four block walk to my car. Even though it was past seven, it was still ninety-six degrees out.  I rubbed sunscreen on my face as I walked, shoes slapping against the sidewalk pavement. My arm brushed the dead bush that lay at the end of the walkway to the shed, then I turned right, onto the street. Cicadas drowned out the sounds of the birds in the trees. I looked behind, and saw Jerry leaning against the shed wall, brushing a sweaty strand of hair out from his face. Even though we both had nightshifts, he wouldn’t leave for at least another thirty minutes. It was important to stagger our departures. 

The sun wasn’t radiating light over the abandoned lots anymore. The gray shade of the evening permeated the empty development project, now. My shadow, split into two, blackened the already black concrete. I reached into my purse, feeling the cool lenses of the sunglasses tossed inside. Even when I was here in the middle of the day, I never liked wearing them out here. The dark tint felt like it was hiding someone. Crouching in the bushes, waiting for me to be all alone. A someone that had somehow walked all the way out here to the center of nothingness, avoided all of our regular checks outside, whose purpose was to keep themselves impossibly hidden, watching us. Waiting. 

Our cars were scattered around the lone patch of grass amongst the oak trees. Mike’s black SUV, my own white sedan, and Jerry’s shining metal cybertruck. Real inconspicuous. 

I opened the driver’s side door to my own car, turning the key in the ignition and immediately switching on the AC. I closed the door, waiting outside as the car cooled. Whatever hellish temperature it was out here, it was always going to be twenty degrees higher in the car. My phone rang, and I immediately picked it up. 

Mike’s voice sounded tired. “Ready to keep going?” 

“Put me on with him.” 

“Alright.” I heard shuffling, and then Mike said, sounding further away: “Go ahead.” 

I tried to put on the calm, reassuring voice I used with the residents at Shady Grove. “Hi, Stewart. Can you hear me?” 

There was no answer, as expected. I heard his quiet breathing through the speaker. Mike must’ve placed the phone pretty close to his face today. As if the centimeter difference to his brain would make matter. I thought it would be best to make it seem like we were having a normal conversation, even if it was one-sided. If he could hear me in there, it would be good to establish a relationship of trust. 

“You’re speaking to Laura, right now. Are you having a pleasant dream?” 

I let my question hang in the air. Sandwiching my phone between my shoulder and ear, I fished out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth as I got out the matches. The first one was a dud. I dropped the spent match on the ground, digging it in with my heel, then realized what I had done. 

“Shit.” I kneeled down, trying not to get my uniform dirty. 

“Laura?” Mike’s voice was still far away. “All good?” 

“Yup. Yeah, Mike,” I said, grabbing the match from the grass. I opened the door, sliding into the driver’s seat as I flicked the match into a plastic bag tied around the gear stick. Connecting the call to the vehicle’s bluetooth, I started pulling out of my parking spot.

“Stewart,” I continued. “I ask about your dream because I wanted to talk to you about something called lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? Instead of the foggy memory of your dream after you wake up, you can become aware of the dream while you’re… well, while you’re in it.” 

I backed out onto the road, swinging a left and accelerating. “And some people who lucid dream, like, who realize that they’re dreaming while they’re still in the dream, can actually control what happens in it. So you could do whatever you want, Stewart. You could fly. You could relive your childhood memories.” I checked my rearview mirror. “You could even talk… um, you could even talk…” 

I heard Mike breathe through his nose. “Laura, this isn’t going to work.” 

“Isn’t it worth trying?” I asked. 

“We’ve been doing this every single day. Aren’t you getting tired? God, I mean, I can hear it in your voice. What was that?” 

“It’s just hard, okay?” I snapped, not meaning to sound as irritable as my tone came out, but it’d been a long day, and it was just getting started. As usual. “This whole thing is crazy. Excuse me if it's a little hard to spit out.” 

Michael didn’t say anything. I mentally chided myself, watching the abandoned lots give away to the sight of the groundlevel freeway. We couldn’t let cracks form. Not now. Not after so long, and so little time left. 

I let ourselves sit in silence for a little while. The truth was, we had no idea if any of this was getting to Stewart. We thought that Stewart’s brain activity was normal. A patient in comatose might be able to hear communication from the outside world, depending on if their brain was still functioning as intended. It was impossible to tell for Stewart, except for the fact that he was still alive. Yeah, I could get basic tools like syringes from Shady Grove, but nothing close to something like an MRI machine. 

As I entered the highway, Mike’s voice resonated through the car. “Are we going to talk about Jerry?” 

 “What’s there to talk about?” 

“You know what.”

“It’s an emotional job, Mike.” 

“No, you get emotional. Jerry–”

“Excuse me?” I said, looking wide-eyed at the phone symbol on the car screen. 

“I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean, your behavior around this– mine, too– that’s normal. We’re bound to get a little stir-crazy from time-to-time, but we keep going, y’know? But stir-crazy is one thing. Going ape-shit on the guy that’s supposed to stay asleep no matter what is another.” 

I watched the light get lower in the sky as mist began to settle on the road. Luckily there were no cars around, but I found myself thankful that I had actually gotten my ass to the mechanic last week to get my low beams fixed. My talk with Mike was beginning to feel like a conversation I had with one of the residents. I forced my voice to be patient. “I’ve seen what we’re giving him in action. If a fraction of that is enough to lull a crazy old bitch to a gentle nap, Stewart wouldn’t wake for the end of the world with what he’s getting.” 

“It’s not just that. What if someone heard?” Mike replied. 

“Who’s going to hear?”

“You never know. Besides–” 

His voice said something loud, maybe urgent. But… what was that? There was something on the road in front me. A pair of white lights, two pinpricks much too small to belong to a car. They stared at me in the other lane as I loosened my foot on the gas. They shone through the fog, piercing through the rolling haze like the sun entering a cave. But this was cold. My eyes were unable to blink as I shivered uncontrollably. Stings of pain began to blot out my vision, tears streaming down my face. I felt the groans of the highway underneath me as I entered the lane separation, the vehicular concrete clawing at the hot rubber of my wheels telling me to turn back. 

The lights were eyes. Terrible, blinding eyes, the result of two needles taken to thick black construction paper and held in front of a brilliant lantern. And the fog was crawling into my car, tendrils of it seeping through the miniscule gap in my windows, foggy fingers groping from within the depths of the air conditioning vent, pure, frosty terror creeping from the crack in my windshield. My fingers burned with cold, feeling frozen to the steering wheel. But my arms slowly turned it. Creeping towards the black silhouette with the white eyes with sickening odyssean lust. 

The black silhouette was crouched, eyes boring into mine. Not even my very, very close headlights could illuminate their features. But I could see their current height well superseding my car. At least six feet tall. Like a shadow manifest. A cold, black shadow. The sky without stars. 

Turn back. Turn back. 

My vision cleared. I swung the wheel the opposite direction, almost snapping my arm with the force of my whiplash. The car squealed, and burning rubber filled my nose, making me gag. I slammed the gas, driving, driving. The fog was so thick. Mike was saying something, but the bluetooth was distorted. It cut off his sentences, leaving periods of silence intercut with hoarse, gasping breaths. 

“Mike,” I rasped, feeling like I needed to cough. “M–”

My car slammed into the broad trunk of a tree. My phone toppled from the cupholder, falling flat on the floor of the car and ending the call. My head slammed forward with the impact, hitting the steering wheel before my airbag activated. A shrill ringing filled my ears. For a second, I had to fight myself to stay awake. I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. I felt sick, vomit threatening to spill through my throat, simultaneously as my head throbbed. 

I sat up, ignoring the possible concussion I had sustained. I took a deep breath, slowly blinking to steady my vision. My windshield was cracked, well, even more than it already had been.  The hood of my car was crumpled like a tin can. 

“Fuck,” I whispered, stifling a sob. 

How the hell was I gonna afford a new car? My salary was already a fucking joke. I had bills to pay. Groceries to buy. And… 

Had that really happened? 

I turned the car off, not that it really mattered anymore. Pushing the airbag out of the way, I groped around the dark car for my phone. Picking it up, I ran my thumb along its shattered screen. At least it still turned on. I thought about what I would do next. As far as I knew, there weren’t any other cars on the road, and definitely no speed cameras. No one had seen what had just happened. I hung up an incoming call from Mike. Time to get out and ring AAA. 

I reached for the door handle, then stopped. There were noises on the roof of the car. 

They were loud, banging one after the other, in slow, rhythmic succession. It sounded like footsteps. I waited to hear them hop onto the back of the trunk, then onto the road. I even craned my neck, wincing at a bruise that had developed right below my ear. But I didn’t see them. In fact, the footsteps didn’t stop. They circled on top of the car. 

My heart began to pound, and I released my breath, not realizing I had been holding it. I absorbed every minute detail of my car. The white cushion of the airbag protruded from the steering wheel. An old coffee cup had fallen to the ground, cold liquid dripping onto the carpeted floor. In the back row was my black duffel bag, inside it was some extra vials of what we fed Stewart, and his IV bag. We planned to transition him to the drip diet once we got some more supplies. For now, we did our best by forcing blended food down his throat. Mike always had a crash bag ready if he started choking. 

I looked out the back window, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the perfect dark. Waiting to see whoever was on my roof appear on the other side. 

My phone rang. 

The blue lit up the entire car. I saw Mike’s name appear like a prehistoric blaze of fire. I gasped as the beating of my chest skipped a hundred years. I heard a tap and I looked and I saw the black silhouette of someone with white glowing eyes peering down at me perched on the roof of my car penetrating and looking into my head with curiosity and unknowability and something that felt like the cold pangs of hunger jab into the inside of my spine. My scream drowned out the phone’s ringtone and the stranger shot their head back. I heard a slam, saw my car’s roof crunch downwards, felt myself close my eyes. 

I knew it could only have been a few seconds later when I opened them. The phone was still ringing. I looked out the window. Nothing. I listened. The roof was quiet. Dazed, I groped around on the floor, taking a few tries before my trembling hands picked the phone up. I slid the answer bar to the right. 

“Laura? Laura, are you there?” Mike sounded panicked. 

I swallowed. “Y-” My voice came out too quiet. “Yeah. Yeah.” Instinctively, I felt my pulse. 

“Laura, I swear to god I fucking saw–” He cut himself off. “Wait, what happened? Are you okay? Did I hear something on your end? You hung up on me.” 

“Um… yeah.” I tried to keep myself calm, focusing on counting the pulse rate. “I got into an accident.” 

“Oh, my god. Are you okay?” Mike’s voice became flat. Neutral. “I’m going to need you to answer my questions for me, okay, Laura?” 

“Oh my god, Mike.” Ten over one hundred. “I’m okay.” 

His voice was calm, but stern. “Are you bleeding?” 

I checked myself again. Just the bruise on my neck. A scrape on my forehead that had already scabbed over. “No.” 

“Was there anyone else in the car with you?” 

“Mike! It was obviously just me!” I didn’t mean to snap at him. Again. I was on edge. The precipice of a razorblade. 

“I’m trying to get a clear picture, right now, Laura. That’s all. Do you feel dizzy? Is your vision blurry?” 

I blinked. “I think I have a small concussion. I’m okay, really.” 

He sighed. “No, you’re not. You need to get that checked out, right away.” 

“Mike! What the fuck happened? Why did you call me?” I squinted, trying to physically recall what happened before my accident with the man in the fog. “Did I hear you yell?”

He hesitated. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I thought I saw Stewart’s lips move.” 

I sat up in my seat. 

“Did you catch what he was saying?” 

“Laura, I don’t know. I don’t know what I saw. I’m more concerned about you.” 

“Mike. What did he say?” 

He took an even longer time to answer. When he finally did, I sat in my car for a long time, still by the side of the highway, watching the shadows. Counting numbers in my head. Thinking. 

“I thought… I thought I saw him mouth ‘help’.”

Woo boy, this one makes me relive the embarrassment, shame and WTF feeling from the moment. And this one is where Artlad did something to create those feelings.

The people in this is Artlad, Bestbro, Bestgal, Goodfella, Sourface and Ms. Mal-doll.

Some new people will appear also.

**Lets just start the story!**

FINALLY! Class is back in session, and the air is filled with *dread.* Oddly enough, it was a cloudy day. Nothing but a grey-colored sky. It was cold too and I was walking to class when I saw Ms. Mal-doll near the student center. I froze and I quickly made a U-turn and nope my way out of there hoping she didn't see me. I wasn't ready for that shit.  A couple of days before, Artlad texted me to give him some space and he didn't want to see anyone right now. So I backed off until he's ready to talk. Goodfella has been taking me to and from campus since we basically lived near by each other. At first I wasn't ~~confort-~~ \*ahem\* ""ready"" to take the next step but Goodfella ~~pushed~~ no he ~~convince,~~ uhhh he ""talked to me"" about it and wanting to advance our relationship. So I would walked to his apartment door where he would wait for me and follow him to his car. After classes I would wait for him to finish both his classes and work and we would drive back. But I still walked everywhere else much to Goodfella's dismay. Speaking of Goodfella, I was walking so fast and not paying attention that I dumped into him. I didn't realized he was looking for me. Told him what was up, and he took me to the library. He got a study room for the two of us and we stayed there to talk/do homework/study for the whole day. Or at lease that was the plan. Artlad was ready to meet up with both Goodfella and I so we told him to stop by. Artlad told us that he was starting the spring semester in his new college.

**Artlad: So yeah, after telling them what happened. They're willing to take me as soon as possible.**

**Me: Now you and Bestbro can be Best pals again huh?**

**Artlad: We still are!**

**Me: Oh you know what I mean.**

**Goodfella: Just don't let you-know-who know ok.**

**Artlad: Haha yeah, I learn my lesson. OH! Did you do the thing already?**

**Me: What thing?**

**Artlad: You the thing where yo---**

Goodfella quickly got up and covered Artlad's mouth and whispered something to his ear. With a ""HAHA oops I almost did the thing again"" then tells me he almost ruin the surprise. What surprise you may ask, well both Goodfella and Artlad wouldn't tell me but Goodfella did promised me it'll be ""fun"".  I want celebrate and like any other introvert, I wanted to buy both Artlad and Goodfella a cup of coffee. As we where walking though the campus to the coffee shop, we saw Bestbro and Bestgal running toward us. Wait?! They don't go to this campus, so why are they here. Artlad being Artlad, was happy to see them and didn't see the worried look at their faces. Turns out Ms. Mal-doll left a note on their apartment door saying something of the lines of ""Either date me Artlad or I'll do something horrible"". That doesn't sound good. We need to get the fuck out but not before we heard a shout from our favorite Neckbeard.

**Sourface: AAAAAAARTLAAAD! There you are you motherfucker!**

Fuuuuuuuuuck!

**Goodfella: Fuck off Sourface!**

**Sourface: No! I'm done with this bastard! I'll fight for my honor after what he did to me!**

**Bestbro: What do mean fight?! Artlad is much as a victum as you!**

**Sourface: PFFT! BULL!**

**Goodfella: Sourface I swear to god-**

**Sourface: SHUT UP FAG!**

**Me: What the hell is going on?**

**Bestgal: \*whisper\* Dizzy! We need to get out!**

**Me: \*whispers back\* But how are we going to-**

WHACK! All of us turn to see Sourface throw a punch at Artlad. Right on the chin. Artlad, while holding his chin was trying to calm Sourface down and saying ""we don't have to do this!"" But Sourface keeps throw whatever punch he can land. Then the oh fuck moment happened.

Artlad shouted ""FUCK IT"" and started to fight Sourface. Artlad is fit and in shape and probably has gotten into one too many fights. Sourface was not and maybe never been to a fight. But Sourface has two things on his side, weight and height. Sourface was about four or three inches taller and twice the girth. Back then was scary but looking back, it look like a monkey trying to fight a elephant. Bestbro tried push them away from each other but ended up taking one of Artlad's kicks and down he goes. Bestgal was frozen while Goodfella and I try to pull them away. Not going to lie, I was fucking panicking and fights triggered my already messed up anxiety disorder. Soon as Bestbro got up, He and Bestgal, now out of her freeze, holds back Artlad while Goodfella and I hold back Sourface. Bestgal shouts ""What the hell is wrong with you two!"" to which Bestbro adds ""are you trying to get kicked out?"" Cue the back and forth with Artlad's he did first and Sourface's he had it coming. Sourface had more bruises then Artlad BUT that wasn't the crazy part.

We were so loud that Ms. Mal-doll found us and ~~running~~ waddling towards us.

**Ms. Mal-doll: Artlad! My love! Are you ok!?**

**Goodfella: Oh dear god! Not you!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Shut up! \*turns to Sourface\* How dare you to hurt Artlad! You Animal!**

**Sourface: Shut up bitch! You're such a whore! Artlad Cucked me and you got the nerve to come up to us!**

**Artlad: PISS OFF!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: That's right my-**

**Artlad: NO! I MEANT YOU! AND SOURFACE! Both of you made my life a living hell! And why would I date someone who cheated before!**

**Ms. Mal-Doll: Cheating?!**

**Sourface: YES! yes you were!**

**Bestbro: It was one way but yes, it's emotional cheating!**

**Artlad: NO! I wasn't the only one!**

**Me: HUH?! The fuck?**

**Goodfella: Ms. Mal-doll? And who? We know she was stalking you Artlad.**

**Artlad: Bonbon told me that she was sleeping around with Beanpole!**

Beanpole? One of Sourface's gaming pals? To cut the story short, turns out when she and Sourface met up with his gaming buddies, Ms. Mal-doll ""fancied"" the only skinny one of the group. I can't confirm nor deny it but this caused Sourface to fucking rage! Ms. Mal-doll broke down crying and saying ""this not what it looks like"" but not at Sourface, oh no no no, she said to Artlad. As if they were dating the first place. Everybody were shouted at once and this triggered me a trauma respond. I was breathing slowly and I somehow I grab Goodfella's arm and buried my face to his sweater. I was trying to dissociate from this.

Then I was snapped out of it when I heard Sourface shout at Artlad to ""stop lying you fag"", Ms. Mal-doll then said ""he's not a fag"" but Artlad proclaims that in fact is gay. Bestbro, Bestgal and I look at him in both confusion and ""quit your bullshit"" feeling. Goodfella was just confused. Sourface then yells ""if that's true, prove it!"" and Ms. Mal-doll now crying as if someone killed her whole family was basically begging Artlad to say it's not true. Of course it wasn't true, Artlad doesn't shut up every time he get a new fling and talks how cute/hot his girl is. But when Artlad is push into a corner, he'll do anything to get out. So what did he do? He pulls me by the arm, catching everybody off guard including me. Pulls me into an embrace and FUCKING MAKES OUT WITH ME! Sorry did I say ""make out"", it was more like slobbering my face. I say that cuz I did NOTHING but freeze and let him. He's a horrible kisser, so bad that when he stopped I had spit up my nose. He ate my whole face. Dogs slobber less then him. Goodfella was hella mad, Bestbro, Bestgal and Sourface was shocked and Ms. Mal-doll had a huge meltdown.

Ms. mal-doll just left without another word. Sourface was the one to break the silence by saying ""this is weird"" and left. Bestbro and Bestgal also left, looking back with this look of worried and hurry out. Leaving me, Artlad and Goodfella alone.

**Me: What was that Artlad?**

**Artlad: I-I-I had-**

**Goodfella: Are you fucking kidding me Artlad? You. Kissed. My. PARTNER!**

**Artlad: I needed to do this!**

**Me: Needed?!**

**Artlad: Yes!**

**Me: Your transferring anyway! What was the point!?**

Before Artlad can talk, Goodfella push him away and look me dead in the eyes.

**Goodfella: Dizzy. You let him kiss you. Do I not matter to you Dizzy?**

**Me: Goodfella I didn't plan this! Artlad just-**

**Goodfella: You still let him.**

**Me: I-I fr-froze Goodfella....**

**Goodfella: Froze? Really**

**Me: G-Goodfella you know about-**

**Goodfella: I know about your past, nothing changes Dizzy**

Goodfella looms over me, I started to have an mild anxiety trigger so I tent to stutter and make of myself small. Artlad was just standing there, how can you intervene to a couple arguing. Goodfella then turns to Artlad tells him something in a low voice, causing him to quickly look me with a ""am sorry"" and quickly leaves. Goodfella turns back to me and his stare caused me to make myself even smaller.

**Me: G-Goodfella, c-can you let me...**

**Goodfella: Let you what Dizzy?**

He steps forward and I walk backwards as we talk back and forth about Artlad and the ""kiss"". Goodfella tried not to sound angry but you can still hear it. I end up tripping backwards and land into a dirt patch. Again, Goodfella still looms over me. I broke.

**Me: L-Look I'm sorry Goodfella! I-I-I couldn't react fast enough and...and...**

**Goodfella: I need time to think. You know what you did Dizzy.**

Goodfella just left after that and I just sat there, on the dirt, feeling like piece of shit. I was crying and shaking cuz I was scared how Goodfella reacted and thinking it was my fault. All could think about is why I didn't push Artlad away. I went home right a way. Good thing no one was home, I didn't want anyone to hear me cry. After some time, Fey send a text telling me that Goodfella needs some time to figure out things. Adding that I should reflect on what I did. That confirmed to me that yes, I fucked up. While listening to my emo music, I ended up writing emails to my professors asking to send me the work the week, I wanted some time away from all of that. I heard my cousin Chikí come in and I stepped out to see her. One look at me and she asked what was wrong. I asked her to come to my room I wanted talk to her alone. As soon as she close the door, I started to cry again and told her everything. I ended up crying on her shoulder. Chikí told me if it was really my fault. Again, yes I did think it was. This was my very first relationship and I feel like I was already fucking it up.

Chikí look unconvinced but didn't push. She simply said to really look into this relationship and really think if this is what I want. I took it as ""you need to do better"" rather looking at the red flags that was right there. I wanted to stop feeling like crap so I popped way more E's then normal. I also secretly took them with liquor cuz I hated myself.

So this part takes place after that whole Ms. Mal-doll BS and takes us to when I needed space from everything. Artlad, Goodfella and I were not in speaking terms with each other ever since that stupid stunt Artlad have pulled on both me and Goodfella. It was awkward as fuck.  All of my professors to give me all of the weeks lessons cuz I ""need to be out of the classroom"" was my excuse, They agreed but I needed to come in on a Saturday to do a test from one of them. Story for another time. My plan was that I would spend some time away from that area until things cool down so I made my way to visit my cousins and my sister four towns over. I didn't tell anyone including Bestbro and Bestgal where I was going but just that I was going. However, my sister was busy with her own school work it so was just my cousins.

The first cousin I visited I'll call Big Bernie. Big Bernie got that name cuz he worked in construction and was in Lucha Libre as his hobby. But he's chronically single and he actually let stay with him for the time being for that reason and after I explain everything. The moment I entered his home I just collapse on to his couch and started sobbing. Big Bernie was old enough to have raised me himself and he's like an older brother to me. I was holding in so much that being away from all of that felt like I could let it all out. My other two cousins came too and I'll name them Anna and Chico. Anna is basically the ""mom cousin"" while Chico is the trouble maker with the heart of gold. Both Anna and Chico are Big Bernie's siblings and Chico is my godfather. Big Bernie gave them the TL;DR version of my story and to say they were not please would be an understatement. However they knew they couldn't just tell my parents cuz old school Mexican tend to exploded in anger at those kind of things. Chico promised me we'll do something fun later. As I was getting my stuff to the guest room when I received a very angry text from the one only Ms. Mal-doll.

**Ms. Mal-doll: I hope you're happy! Not only I broke up with Sourface but you also broke my heart what you did with Artlad! You're such a dick!**

The memory of Artlad and Goodfella and the amount of spit came flashing back. Fucking gross. I did not reply and turn off my phone but not before checking if Goodfella texted me at all. Nope, not once and at the time this broke me more and I cried into a pillow. Now I know that Goodfella was making me miss him. Artlad send one text saying he was now getting to transfer to his new college and wished me luck but did say now it'll be easier to hang out now. That made me so mad cuz I was blaming him for basically drooling on me and making Goodfella ""hate me"". I didn't tell him any of that but Goodfella was my first real relationship and Artlad made it awkward. After crying like a little bish, Big Bernie called me to have lunch with him. I got up and headed to the restroom to freshen up. I looked like shit. My eyes was red and puffy from crying so much, I had dark circles under my eyes from trying and failing to sleep the night before and I realized my skin was so bad I look like a mummy come to life. Drugs and lack of care will do that to you.

As I entered the kitchen, I see Big Bernie with two sandwiches and sodas and I sat at his tiny table, picking at my food. Despite looking big and scary, Big Bernie really is just a big teddy bear. He was one to ask the question nobody have ever asked.

**Big Bernie: How are you doing with your classes?**

For some reason, this triggered me to softly tear up and answered ""bad"". I barely passed my last class, and my English class at the time when from A's to C's and too many of my art teachers keep telling me that my work didn't match the assignment. One of my flyers looked like I was promoting antidepressants rather then promoting a car dealership. When though people did ask how I was feeling but how I was managing was never came to my mind nor nobody really ask about my classes. Not even Chikí asked. Or maybe I was too out of it that I didn't notice. I told this to Big Bernie and he just leans back of his chair and sighed.

**Big Bernie: Look, Chikí and her husband aren't good when it comes to others emotions that's not their kids.**

**Me: I don't want them to even worry about it! Everything that's happening is been my fault!**

**Big Bernie: True, but Chikí knows you're popping pills and sees you trying to keep your friendships while learning to maintain a relationship that was really new to you.**

**Me: You don't need to be nice to me. I did this to myself.**

**Big Bernie: Did you forced that boy and that girl to date each other?**

**Me: No, I just kinda convince them but wasn't-**

**Big Bernie: Wasn't thinking it'll come to life?**

**Me: Y-Yeah...bu-**

**Big Bernie: Did you push this girl to step out her OWN relationship to chase your friend? And Fighting with her ""boyfriend""?**

**Me: No...but I-**

**Big Bernie: Did you made that fat fuck fight with her in the first place? And did set up Artlad to uhhh cuck him? Is that the right word?**

**Me: No and no and yeah, it's the right word. But still!**

**Big Bernie: But still what? I know you did it to keep them away from y'all but you still feel the need to fix it? When it's out of your control how they react and do?**

**Me: I feel guilty. I was one to to push those two and I made it to a bigger mess!**

**Big Bernie: And was it you who pushed Artlad to slobber you in drool?**

**Me: NO! That came out of no where!**

**Big Bernie: \*sigh\* Look, either you tell me why you feel that or you're not telling me the truth.**

I covered my face with my hands, I felt the tears just wetting my hands, I felt guilty for being so involved with everybody's business and needed to fix it cuz I stuck my foot where it didn't belonged. I whimpered that to Big Bernie and he let out a long sigh that only a father would let out. Big Bernie then didn't push after that and after I ate I went back to the guest room. Big Bernie made it clear that it ONLY one week. But I figured I won't stay the full week since I just needed to be away from the people to clear my head.

As I lay on that bed, I turn on my phone again. I did it only because I wanted to keep up appearances to my close family so they wouldn't worry. However as soon as I did, Goodfella send over ten texts asking me to call him. I hid in the restroom since it filtered noise from anyone hearing. I called him soon as I locked the door and he answered on the second ring.

**Goodfella: DIZZY! Thank god you're ok!**

**Me: Goodfella I'm fine just visiting family.**

**Goodfella: \*deep inhale\* Dizzy....we need to talk.**

On the outside I tried to sound calm but inside I was panicking the fuck out.

**Me: Ok, sure....**

**Goodfella: Dizzy, I think we should stay away from everybody for now and focus on us.**

**Me: But need to face them an-**

**Goodfella: No we don't Dizzy. I say let them fight and we stay out of the way. You don't need to fix their mistakes.**

**Me: Hehe, funny that's what a family member just said to me just now.**

**Goodfella: See! Come on love, when you come back I promise to take you some where nice.**

**Me: But you're not mad what Artlad did yesterday?**

**Goodfella: Yeah at Artlad not you. On one hand he felt caged but on the other, You're dating me!**

**Me: I'm trying to forget that.**

**Goodfella: So am I, also I miss the way you hug me. How I tower over you.**

**Me: Uhh I mean I do miss our alone time.**

**Goodfella: I'll be waiting hon. Take care.**

After we hung up, it took me a couple of minutes to hit me on what words he used. This was the first time he called me ""love"" and ""hon"". Being Aromantic I just thought that was being romantic looked like. But I was relived that Goodfella wasn't mad at me and me and him are now on speaking terms again. But it didn't remove the fear that as soon as I step foot on that campus, there's hell to be paid. Chico came back to take me to an old arcade that I used to go when I was a little kid. I hop on his beat-up pick-up truck and headed there. It still look like how I remembered it, same plaza, same shops and same book store where I got my old books. We entered the arcade and the familiar smell brought back memories. The smell of stale BO and old cigarettes filled the room. The funny thing about this arcade is that this place also sells pizza and other Italian food so pizza-sauce also filled the room. Chico and I headed to our favorite game (Pac-man lol) and played a few rounds to ease my tension. After eating pizza that was both burned and soggy, Chico starts talking.

**Chico: Ey Dizzy, you don't need to have a long face! You beat me twice on Pac-Man!**

**Me: Chico, I can't stop thinking about my relationship issues.**

**Chico: BAH! You're 20! You have time to figure shit out!**

**Me: Chico, it hurts that I hurt my partner. I uhh also hurting my friendships too.**

**Chico: Look Dizzy, Big Bernie told me everything and what you need is stand with feet!**

**Me: Stand with feet? You mean stand your ground?**

**Chico: SI si, eso! {yes yes that!} Sometimes you need to forget about it and have fun!**

**Me: I don't know Chico...**

**Chico: Awww Dizzy! I know you're sad but you can't be sad all the time. You're here to relax from everything. So, LETS HAVE FUN!**

Chico is right, I needed to stop thinking about for my own mental health. I tend to overthink when it comes to these thing which I'm still learning to this day. Old habits die hard. The rest of the night, we went to different places including this seafood restaurant, sports shop and video game café. I haven't thought about anyone and haven't popped pills at all! Small victories. Later that night, back at Big Bernie's place, I checked my phone, mostly out of habit I see that Artlad still not talking to me but word from the grapevine is Ms. Mal-doll finally got the hint and has stopped her BS. I swear she and Queenie are birds of a feather. the weird part is that Bonbon still friends with Ms. Mal-doll. Goodfella however send me a link to something. I open it and it was about how to fix a relationship and how to learn to compromise with her partner. Planting the seeds he's still somewhat believes I let Artlad do it. A small ping of guilt hit me. I read it anyway cuz again, my first relationship.

Goodfella also send a voice note saying like ""he'll wait for me"" and how ""he can get over my disrespect of him"". He didn't really said like that but very close. After years later, I still can't believed that I not only was on drugs but also my first relationship was waving so many red flags that only a fool would ignore it.

So the week was a mixture of relaxation and anticipation. Relaxation cuz for the most part I was distracted with family doing stuff and anticipation cuz Goodfella would sometimes send links/voice notes how he's giving me this since it's my first relationship and he's giving me a grace period to learn. And in between all of that, he would also send really horny texts akin to ""wanting to hug me again"" and ""this bringing us closer"". I went back early Saturday for my test and to my shock, not only I was just passing my classes but there's only two week left in the semester. That means it's cramping time! The campus was filled with way more student at this time since they offered tutoring and many have took that opportunity.

Two good things happened that week. I given the ok to get a on-campus job for next semester meaning not only I was work for Sr. Cholo (although is was under the table) but I was now working to afford living on my own! The other thing is the *chismé* of the week was that Ms. Mal-doll not only moved on quickly and started to ~~harass~~ get to know someone in one of Goodfella's business classes. That's the last of the legbeards in this saga. However not all was good. Goodfella was basically escorting me to and from classes/study groups whenever he can. Goodfella was happy to hear I was now starting to work on campus but his undertone about what job I was getting should have a yellow flag in me. The reason Goodfella was always near me is because ~~he groomed~~ talked to me about becoming more serious in our relationship. My family was very happy to hear I was becoming more and more independent and ask the question ""when am I moving into my own place?""

Welp, shit. I didn't about it. I couldn't answer so I went to Bestbro and Bestgal about it and they said to ask around if anyone needed a roommate. Artlad and I are still not on speaking terms, so I ask Goodfella and he said that I should move in with him. Number one I've told him there's no room for me in that apartment and number two, it would be awkward between me and Sourface. Goodfella then tells me that Fey was looking for his replacement since he was planning to move in with HIS new boyfriend. That means if I do move in them, I would be getting Fey's old room. ""If"", like I had a second option. Of course I would be moving in with Goodfella and his brother. From what the campus said the amount of payment I would get was more then enough to cover the rent plus other things.

This push us to the end of the semester. I passed all my classes with B's and C's and we had about three week before the start of the next semester. So, party at Bestbro's and Artlad's place. Artlad finally talked to me, saying sorry for what he did but to fix it, he was helping Goodfella with the ""thing"". He emphasized that I HAD to be there. This also marks the day I started packing. Before the party, I started putting my things into boxes and I only had a few things to pack. Mostly clothes, books, bedding and my gaming set-up and the only thing I needed a pick-up truck was for my desk. Chikí might be hard-headed but she was sad to see move out. Her kids did cry when they first heard it but I told them I was still in the area and I can come visit anytime. Chikí was helping me pack and while packing she told me a story that I've never heard before.

""You know when I was your age, it was my first time moving out too. My mama was crying and crying how 'her little nina was growing up'. I was also moved in with someone I know, but I got carried away. And that's how I landed in prison the first time. I got into way too many fights."" She said. Now I'm not going to tell the whole story but just know that I knew she went to prison but wasn't aware of why until now. That story was eye-opening cuz the reason she was harsh on me cuz I was acting just like her but without the bar-fighting.

Now PARTY TIME! I wore my best outfit! Basically my favorite skater outfit even though I don't ride skateboards. This party was BYOB/BYOL meaning everybody had to bring booze! Bless my cousin's husband, he give me the best case of tequila! I'm talking like 8 bottles of it. I think he was joking or not being ""illegal booze cuz it had one worm per bottle"" but when I look at it, it was hard to tell cuz the bottles were too dark to see though.

I headed out and Artlad was the one to open the door, we exchange few hellos and small talk but not much. Everybody was already there but a lack of Sourface it seems. Goodfella was pouring drinks and I set my offerings on the counter asked him about Sourface. With a roll of the eyes, Goodfella show a text from Sourface saying he rather be with his gaming buddies. Welp, nothing was lost so we spend the party at each others side. There's a lot of people but not crowded enough to be cramped in that apartment. Pizza and booze was a plenty, people were mingling, jokes and stories were told and a HALLELUJAH from everybody when Artlad made a speech about the end of exam week and three weeks of rest. The funny part? Chikí's husband wasn't joking. The worm hit me HARD! I was a giggly bish and maybe have been overly expressing PDA to Goodfella. I. Don't. Do. PDA. That was the first and only time I've ever did. That caused Artlad to nudged Goodfella to ""do the thing"". Drunk me was like ""OoOoOOoh what tHinG? GoOdFeLla yOu shOUld'T HavE!"" Shoot me now!

Goodfella grabs my hand and takes me to one of the rooms. It was Artlad's room cuz I recognized the pony easel he uses during his hikes. We sit on Artlad's bed and Goodfella slides half of hand under my jeans. Kissing starts. Goodfella pulls me into an embrace and says ""we're going to Big Bear this weekend!"" Me being drunk answered ""cool how fun"" and quickly got up to run to the restroom. Puking once again.

I walked out, a little sick and Goodfella was outside trying not to look disappointed and helps me to the couch. The next day Artlad texted me ""dude I can't believe you blue balled Goodfella! I for sure thought both of you would go third base"". I sober up realizing Goodfella was batting for third base. Oops. I guess that was the ""thing"" Artlad and Goodfella was talking about. However, Goodfella did set us up to a weekend trip to Big Bear. We talked about it back and forth as I started to move my stuff to Fey's old room. Fey was also kind enough to leave me his old bed too since he ""wouldn't be needing it anymore"" as this room was twice the size from the last one so I had a lot of empty space, even with the desk.

Sourface wasn't there the whole time since he was staying with his folks. But as soon as he saw me there, he was not happy. Long story short, Fey moved out early, I took over, Sourface set a new rule that he was hellbent on, ""NO GAY SHIT!"" Goodfella asked what he meant and I shit you not, Sourface said ""I don't wanna hear you two butt-fucking each other!"" Mind you, both Goodfella's and mine's rooms where in the left side of the apartment. Sourface's room was the only one on the right side, so no wall connects to his. Fine, we agreed just to end the convo.

The first night was hard, Sourface played loud ass music and their kitchen was filled with boxed and frozen meals. Fun fact before we continue, I wear glasses, always have, so I always have a bottle of cleaner and glasses rags near me. Sourface, took my shit to clean his computer screen! My rags were now covered in cheeto dust, sticky soda and random white stuff. So I had to buy new rags and a bottle of cleaner but I hid them. Sourface ""demanded"" me to hand it over when he asked, I told him I would if he goes to fuck himself. Sourface didn't ask anymore. Also, I became the roommate that cooks. I would make food for me and Goodfella and whatever what was left, Sourface would eat it. Goodfella would also call me his ""little domestic partner"", ""future hubby"" and ""his little housekeep"". While hugging me from the back as I was cooking, cleaning and/or folding my own laundry. The only thing I was grateful to Sourface is that he would yell at us to quit the gay BS and having back and forth with Goodfella. It was impossible to show PDA when Sourface was there. Also Sourface never closes his door so sound and smell was hard to ignore so that's how he knew.

So the weekend came in! Now Big Bear is this touristy town for hikers, campers, snowboarding (in the winter) among other woodsy activities in the San Bernardino mountains. We don't look like outdoor people, in fact I look like your typical gaming bro and Goodfella always wears something expensive. I never knew Goodfella liked the outdoors. I thought ""are we going Glamping?"" but no, Goodfella got a cabin meant for two people. However, spring came early that year and warm weather started. I was packing a small bag when Sourface appear on my door.

**Sourface: I can't believe I'll have the apartment all to myself this weekend. You however, Pfft I doubt you'll make it in the wilderness. Only alphas are meant for the woods!**

**Me: Sourface, why are you hating? Shouldn't you be planning what to do this weekend?**

**Sourface: I did! The boys and I are gathering here to do what every alpha does when men came together!**

**Me: That sounds gay.**

**Sourface: Oh fuck off!**

He then walks back to his room. I had a shit-eating grin and Goodfella walks in and plants a kiss on my cheek. He heard the whole thing.

I think I'll ended here. The next part will be me and Goodfella riding to Big Bear. Thank you for reading, I know this is long and confusing but from here on out, is going to be one single line. Drink lots of fluids ~~does aloe vera drink count as healthy?~~ and with peace and love, DIZZY OUT!",1,1770847494.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

Jerry and Michael were already in the shed, and they were arguing as usual. 

“Why do you always have to be so negative all the time?” 

Michael bit into his meatball sub, squeezing the sides so tightly that I traced the flying glob of tomato sauce flying through the air. His teeth chewed on the hunks of meat in between buns of white bread, biting into the brown stained with sauce, some getting into his beard. “Awl I shed wash he probably doeshn’t dream ‘bout anything.” He swallowed. “What’s your deal?” 

Jerry’s face was equally as red as the tomato sauce. “Why do I have to be so negative–?” He turned to me. “Laura. Back me up here–” 

“Hi, Laura,” Michael interrupted. 

Jerry closed his eyes for a solid four seconds. Keeping his back to Michael, he ran a hand through his balding blond hair, pressing the palm tight against his pale forehead. It reminded me of an ironing board smoothing out the wrinkles on a crusty t-shirt. Jerry opened his eyes. “As I was saying–” 

“What’s up, Mike?” I responded. 

Jerry stomped his foot against the ground. “Fuck! Fuck! God fucking… would you just let me get one fucking word in? I swear to God, I’ll–” He was interrupted again as Mike dropped his sub to the floor, striding over to Jerry in two efficient steps, then using his own boot to crush down on Jerry’s stomping foot. Before Jerry could yell any further, Make clamped a hand over Jerry’s mouth, smearing a little sauce on Jerry’s round face. Mike held up a finger to his own mouth, shushing him.

I looked at Mike’s alarmed expression, then towards the window of the shack. 

The supply shack was about the size of a small garage. Big for a shed. Huge for a shed out here. Definitely fine enough for our purposes. It was made of pieces of rusted tin, hammered together to form four walls once painted a deep green. An automatic light hung outside the small door on the far side of the room, though its bulb had been removed long ago. The wall facing the street had small windows near the ceiling, allowing some sunlight to drift onto the concrete floor. The floor sloped downward against that same wall, more cracks and warps contributing to the dirtstained concrete until it reached a near vertical angle, stopping when it reached the very foundation of the wall. 

We waited in silence, Mike slowly removing his hands away from Jerry’s face. I crept over to the corner, grabbing a roll of paper towels from the carpenter’s table. While I scooped up the splattered sandwich, Mike creaked the door open. We all collectively grimaced, covering our dark-adjusted eyes. A gust of wind blew the short black hair on his forward, plastering it to his pale forehead. It tickled his beard, still stained with tomato sauce. Underneath his red baseball cap, his brown eyes scanned back and forth, then he stepped outside, inching the door shut behind him. 

Jerry leaned in to whisper: “I’m just saying, Laura, don’t you think Bob here… like, don’t you think he dreams?” 

“Stop talking, Jerry,” I replied, my eyes glued to the door. If I could will my ears to perk like an animal’s, I would.

He finally shut his mouth. 

We could hear Mike walking outside, his feet echoing off the driveway. He walked once around the shed, then paused at the door. He began to open it, his shadow spilling into the unilluminated room, then stopped, apparently reconsidering. He closed the door again, walking once more around the shed. I even heard him walk down the driveway, towards the street out front, before finally returning, definitively closing the door shut behind him as he re-entered the shed. 

Mike took a toothpick out from his green-gray duck chore coat, jaw flexing as he chewed on the tip. 

I gently placed the sub remains inside a trash bag, then tied it shut, setting it down next to the door so no one would forget to take it with them later. 

Jerry appeared unfazed. “Anyway,” he continued. “I was just saying that I think Bob, here–” 

“I thought we agreed on Stewart,” Michael grunted. 

“Fine. Stewart. Don’t you think he dreams?”

I looked at Stewart’s operating table. The shiny metal slab took up most of the room, sitting on locked wheels and holding up the body of the comatose man. He had deep brown hair, parted to the right. Stubble had grown over his tan face, and his narrow eyes darted frantically around his surroundings behind closed eyelids. I moved closer, shifting his body a little away from the edge of the table. Recoiling as I got near his diaper, I turned my nose away. 

Moving as quickly as I could, I took a syringe from my left pocket, and a vial of clear liquid from the other. I poked the needle through the lid, filling the syringe to the brim. I tapped the side, the metal *plinking* against my fingernail, as I cleared away the excess drips. Nodding to Jerry, he wordlessly crossed over to my side of the table, recoiling at the smell, too, as he held down Stewart’s arm to keep it as still as possible. Mike handed me a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol, and I swabbed the skin over a twisting, blue vein. Leaning in close, I sunk the needle into the skin at an angle, letting the tip enter Stewart’s bloodstream. 

I looked at Jerry and Michael as I drained the needle into him. “Isn’t the whole point that he does dream?” 

Jerry wrung his hands. “THANK YOU!” 

Michael rolled his eyes. “I meant, I don’t think he’s conscious of his dreams. Like, isn’t there a whole study that says you always dream when you sleep, but you pretty much never remember the majority of them?” 

“What difference does that make?” Jerry spluttered. “If he’s dreaming, he’s dreaming! I swear, you’re just disagreeing with me because it– it pleases you to be nihilistic. You always have to have the opposite opinion of me. Like, Laura, I think Stewart’s dreaming of a field of butterflies, and Michael…” 

“I think he’s experiencing what it’s like to be in the womb. Just some floating spirit not even aware of what the hell’s going on.” Michael finished. A shadow crossed his face. “But I’m not a nihilist.” 

I slid the needle out and placed it in a water basin. Then I picked up the copy of the Bible sitting on the shelf by the rusting metal door. I whacked both of them on the head with it before they could react. 

Jerry rubbed his head. “Hey!” 

“One of you needs to change his diaper. I did it yesterday.” 

Jerry and Mike looked at each other. They held out their hands for rock, paper, scissors. Mike was rock, Jerry was scissors. 

“Best of three?” Jerry tried. Mike shoved a clean diaper into his arms. Jerry sighed. He snapped on a pair of medical gloves and covered his face with a mask. I reached into the sink, squirting dish soap onto a yellow sponge before carefully running it over the needle. I kept the water pressure at a low, wishing again that I had access to better disinfectants. Michael fished his smartphone out of his pocket, turning the volume down to one before selecting an app that was playing the news. 

Over the quiet trickle of running water, I could just barely make out the reporter’s voice coming out from the phone’s speaker. “More bodies in Jordan as alleged border disputes with The United Arab Emirates escalates to an unprecedented–” Mike swiped, switching to a different news station. “--Twenty-three Texas school children dead in Tentuskiville shooting–” Swipe. “--Kremlin officials deny ethnic cleansing allegations made by six members of the U.N. Security Council in regards to the Russian controlled state of–” Swipe. “--Refugees escaping in droves as more of the Mediterranean coastline is swallowed by rising sea levels. When asked if any cities in the United States would be made sanctuaries, the president responded–”

Mike stared at his reflection in the black screen of his phone. Jerry sniffed, eyes frozen on Stewart. He whispered something under his breath. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Piece of shit,” He said again, a little louder. Jerry threw the diaper into the bag, then laid trembling hands on the edge of the operating table. “Piece of shit!” He started shaking it violently, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with red. 

“Jerry!” I shouted. Mike and I locked eyes, and we rushed to Jerry’s side, tackling him to the floor. Jerry was still thrashing violently, teeth gritted and palms sweating. Mike squeezed his arm around his mouth, trying to stop him from making any noise. 

“Shh!” He hissed.

I held Jerry’s other arm down, pressing it against the cold, uneven concrete floor. Then he kicked his foot, hitting the leg of the table. It began to roll across the room, down a steady downwards slope. 

We immediately dropped Jerry, rushing to intercept the speeding table. I grabbed its side, grunting as I tried to keep the metal slab with the heavier man on top from sliding any further. Mike dashed to the other side, pulling it with his arms. Stewart’s body slid precariously to the edge, almost rolling over on top of me. I reached my arms up, steadying the man. We rolled the table back into place, Michael edging Stewart back to his position in the center. 

This time, it was my turn to check outside. 

The sun beat down on me as soon as I stepped out the door. I squinted, trying to see anything past the glare of the day. Even though the sun was low in the sky, there were no houses to block it from blinding me. I began to slowly circle the shed, looking around me at the miles of the same old overgrown, abandoned development project. It was the outline of a neighborhood, with sun-stained sidewalks, cracked driveways, and empty foundations. There were no cars, though. No wires, no telephone poles, streetlamps, houses, or thankfully, people. The shed itself sat on an identical lot filled with weeds and scattered bushes. My guess was that this belonged to someone before the land even started development. And it was still here after. 

I wasn’t as paranoid as Mike. I elected to only walk around the shed once. In the far distance, beyond the concrete nothingness, I could see the grove of trees where we parked our cars, though the vehicles themselves were hidden from my line of sight. If anyone had heard our noises, they were either hiding over there, or they weren’t here at all. There was no possible way to sneak up on us in this place. 

That didn’t stop us from being careful. 

When I came back inside, Jerry was still on the floor, hugging his knees. He looked tearfully at Mike and I. “Is he still asleep?” 

I approached the operating table. Stewart’s eyes were still closed, still rapidly moving underneath his eyelids. I walked around, gently gripping his head as I used my other hand to lay two fingers on his neck. I nodded to Mike, who raised his arm, checking his watch. I felt the thumping of Stewart’s heart, and I closed my eyes, counting in my head. Jerry drew in a long breath, then got up, moving towards the basin, where he picked up the needle, holding the bottle at the ready. 

The watch beeped. Mike looked up at me. 

“Thirty-nine BPM. Still asleep.”

Mike breathed a sigh of relief. Jerry slumped over, holding his head in his hands. 

I pulled up a stool, releasing a long exhale through my nose. I sat down, letting my shoulders sag. Even as my posture relaxed, I couldn’t help but let my head trail up, looking past the operating table with the still-asleep Stewart, past Jerry, who was lying on the floor and staring straight up at the water-damaged ceiling, and past Mike, who was finishing putting on the diaper. My eyes fell past all of them and onto the space just above the doorway to the shed, to the message scrawled messily in red paint. The one I forced myself to look at every single day.

WE ARE BETTER OFF WITH HIM ASLEEP. 

# JULY 12. 7:33 PM. 

I muttered a goodbye to Mike and Jerry, then I started the four block walk to my car. Even though it was past seven, it was still ninety-six degrees out.  I rubbed sunscreen on my face as I walked, shoes slapping against the sidewalk pavement. My arm brushed the dead bush that lay at the end of the walkway to the shed, then I turned right, onto the street. Cicadas drowned out the sounds of the birds in the trees. I looked behind, and saw Jerry leaning against the shed wall, brushing a sweaty strand of hair out from his face. Even though we both had nightshifts, he wouldn’t leave for at least another thirty minutes. It was important to stagger our departures. 

The sun wasn’t radiating light over the abandoned lots anymore. The gray shade of the evening permeated the empty development project, now. My shadow, split into two, blackened the already black concrete. I reached into my purse, feeling the cool lenses of the sunglasses tossed inside. Even when I was here in the middle of the day, I never liked wearing them out here. The dark tint felt like it was hiding someone. Crouching in the bushes, waiting for me to be all alone. A someone that had somehow walked all the way out here to the center of nothingness, avoided all of our regular checks outside, whose purpose was to keep themselves impossibly hidden, watching us. Waiting. 

Our cars were scattered around the lone patch of grass amongst the oak trees. Mike’s black SUV, my own white sedan, and Jerry’s shining metal cybertruck. Real inconspicuous. 

I opened the driver’s side door to my own car, turning the key in the ignition and immediately switching on the AC. I closed the door, waiting outside as the car cooled. Whatever hellish temperature it was out here, it was always going to be twenty degrees higher in the car. My phone rang, and I immediately picked it up. 

Mike’s voice sounded tired. “Ready to keep going?” 

“Put me on with him.” 

“Alright.” I heard shuffling, and then Mike said, sounding further away: “Go ahead.” 

I tried to put on the calm, reassuring voice I used with the residents at Shady Grove. “Hi, Stewart. Can you hear me?” 

There was no answer, as expected. I heard his quiet breathing through the speaker. Mike must’ve placed the phone pretty close to his face today. As if the centimeter difference to his brain would make matter. I thought it would be best to make it seem like we were having a normal conversation, even if it was one-sided. If he could hear me in there, it would be good to establish a relationship of trust. 

“You’re speaking to Laura, right now. Are you having a pleasant dream?” 

I let my question hang in the air. Sandwiching my phone between my shoulder and ear, I fished out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth as I got out the matches. The first one was a dud. I dropped the spent match on the ground, digging it in with my heel, then realized what I had done. 

“Shit.” I kneeled down, trying not to get my uniform dirty. 

“Laura?” Mike’s voice was still far away. “All good?” 

“Yup. Yeah, Mike,” I said, grabbing the match from the grass. I opened the door, sliding into the driver’s seat as I flicked the match into a plastic bag tied around the gear stick. Connecting the call to the vehicle’s bluetooth, I started pulling out of my parking spot.

“Stewart,” I continued. “I ask about your dream because I wanted to talk to you about something called lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? Instead of the foggy memory of your dream after you wake up, you can become aware of the dream while you’re… well, while you’re in it.” 

I backed out onto the road, swinging a left and accelerating. “And some people who lucid dream, like, who realize that they’re dreaming while they’re still in the dream, can actually control what happens in it. So you could do whatever you want, Stewart. You could fly. You could relive your childhood memories.” I checked my rearview mirror. “You could even talk… um, you could even talk…” 

I heard Mike breathe through his nose. “Laura, this isn’t going to work.” 

“Isn’t it worth trying?” I asked. 

“We’ve been doing this every single day. Aren’t you getting tired? God, I mean, I can hear it in your voice. What was that?” 

“It’s just hard, okay?” I snapped, not meaning to sound as irritable as my tone came out, but it’d been a long day, and it was just getting started. As usual. “This whole thing is crazy. Excuse me if it's a little hard to spit out.” 

Michael didn’t say anything. I mentally chided myself, watching the abandoned lots give away to the sight of the groundlevel freeway. We couldn’t let cracks form. Not now. Not after so long, and so little time left. 

I let ourselves sit in silence for a little while. The truth was, we had no idea if any of this was getting to Stewart. We thought that Stewart’s brain activity was normal. A patient in comatose might be able to hear communication from the outside world, depending on if their brain was still functioning as intended. It was impossible to tell for Stewart, except for the fact that he was still alive. Yeah, I could get basic tools like syringes from Shady Grove, but nothing close to something like an MRI machine. 

As I entered the highway, Mike’s voice resonated through the car. “Are we going to talk about Jerry?” 

 “What’s there to talk about?” 

“You know what.”

“It’s an emotional job, Mike.” 

“No, you get emotional. Jerry–”

“Excuse me?” I said, looking wide-eyed at the phone symbol on the car screen. 

“I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean, your behavior around this– mine, too– that’s normal. We’re bound to get a little stir-crazy from time-to-time, but we keep going, y’know? But stir-crazy is one thing. Going ape-shit on the guy that’s supposed to stay asleep no matter what is another.” 

I watched the light get lower in the sky as mist began to settle on the road. Luckily there were no cars around, but I found myself thankful that I had actually gotten my ass to the mechanic last week to get my low beams fixed. My talk with Mike was beginning to feel like a conversation I had with one of the residents. I forced my voice to be patient. “I’ve seen what we’re giving him in action. If a fraction of that is enough to lull a crazy old bitch to a gentle nap, Stewart wouldn’t wake for the end of the world with what he’s getting.” 

“It’s not just that. What if someone heard?” Mike replied. 

“Who’s going to hear?”

“You never know. Besides–” 

His voice said something loud, maybe urgent. But… what was that? There was something on the road in front me. A pair of white lights, two pinpricks much too small to belong to a car. They stared at me in the other lane as I loosened my foot on the gas. They shone through the fog, piercing through the rolling haze like the sun entering a cave. But this was cold. My eyes were unable to blink as I shivered uncontrollably. Stings of pain began to blot out my vision, tears streaming down my face. I felt the groans of the highway underneath me as I entered the lane separation, the vehicular concrete clawing at the hot rubber of my wheels telling me to turn back. 

The lights were eyes. Terrible, blinding eyes, the result of two needles taken to thick black construction paper and held in front of a brilliant lantern. And the fog was crawling into my car, tendrils of it seeping through the miniscule gap in my windows, foggy fingers groping from within the depths of the air conditioning vent, pure, frosty terror creeping from the crack in my windshield. My fingers burned with cold, feeling frozen to the steering wheel. But my arms slowly turned it. Creeping towards the black silhouette with the white eyes with sickening odyssean lust. 

The black silhouette was crouched, eyes boring into mine. Not even my very, very close headlights could illuminate their features. But I could see their current height well superseding my car. At least six feet tall. Like a shadow manifest. A cold, black shadow. The sky without stars. 

Turn back. Turn back. 

My vision cleared. I swung the wheel the opposite direction, almost snapping my arm with the force of my whiplash. The car squealed, and burning rubber filled my nose, making me gag. I slammed the gas, driving, driving. The fog was so thick. Mike was saying something, but the bluetooth was distorted. It cut off his sentences, leaving periods of silence intercut with hoarse, gasping breaths. 

“Mike,” I rasped, feeling like I needed to cough. “M–”

My car slammed into the broad trunk of a tree. My phone toppled from the cupholder, falling flat on the floor of the car and ending the call. My head slammed forward with the impact, hitting the steering wheel before my airbag activated. A shrill ringing filled my ears. For a second, I had to fight myself to stay awake. I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. I felt sick, vomit threatening to spill through my throat, simultaneously as my head throbbed. 

I sat up, ignoring the possible concussion I had sustained. I took a deep breath, slowly blinking to steady my vision. My windshield was cracked, well, even more than it already had been.  The hood of my car was crumpled like a tin can. 

“Fuck,” I whispered, stifling a sob. 

How the hell was I gonna afford a new car? My salary was already a fucking joke. I had bills to pay. Groceries to buy. And… 

Had that really happened? 

I turned the car off, not that it really mattered anymore. Pushing the airbag out of the way, I groped around the dark car for my phone. Picking it up, I ran my thumb along its shattered screen. At least it still turned on. I thought about what I would do next. As far as I knew, there weren’t any other cars on the road, and definitely no speed cameras. No one had seen what had just happened. I hung up an incoming call from Mike. Time to get out and ring AAA. 

I reached for the door handle, then stopped. There were noises on the roof of the car. 

They were loud, banging one after the other, in slow, rhythmic succession. It sounded like footsteps. I waited to hear them hop onto the back of the trunk, then onto the road. I even craned my neck, wincing at a bruise that had developed right below my ear. But I didn’t see them. In fact, the footsteps didn’t stop. They circled on top of the car. 

My heart began to pound, and I released my breath, not realizing I had been holding it. I absorbed every minute detail of my car. The white cushion of the airbag protruded from the steering wheel. An old coffee cup had fallen to the ground, cold liquid dripping onto the carpeted floor. In the back row was my black duffel bag, inside it was some extra vials of what we fed Stewart, and his IV bag. We planned to transition him to the drip diet once we got some more supplies. For now, we did our best by forcing blended food down his throat. Mike always had a crash bag ready if he started choking. 

I looked out the back window, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the perfect dark. Waiting to see whoever was on my roof appear on the other side. 

My phone rang. 

The blue lit up the entire car. I saw Mike’s name appear like a prehistoric blaze of fire. I gasped as the beating of my chest skipped a hundred years. I heard a tap and I looked and I saw the black silhouette of someone with white glowing eyes peering down at me perched on the roof of my car penetrating and looking into my head with curiosity and unknowability and something that felt like the cold pangs of hunger jab into the inside of my spine. My scream drowned out the phone’s ringtone and the stranger shot their head back. I heard a slam, saw my car’s roof crunch downwards, felt myself close my eyes. 

I knew it could only have been a few seconds later when I opened them. The phone was still ringing. I looked out the window. Nothing. I listened. The roof was quiet. Dazed, I groped around on the floor, taking a few tries before my trembling hands picked the phone up. I slid the answer bar to the right. 

“Laura? Laura, are you there?” Mike sounded panicked. 

I swallowed. “Y-” My voice came out too quiet. “Yeah. Yeah.” Instinctively, I felt my pulse. 

“Laura, I swear to god I fucking saw–” He cut himself off. “Wait, what happened? Are you okay? Did I hear something on your end? You hung up on me.” 

“Um… yeah.” I tried to keep myself calm, focusing on counting the pulse rate. “I got into an accident.” 

“Oh, my god. Are you okay?” Mike’s voice became flat. Neutral. “I’m going to need you to answer my questions for me, okay, Laura?” 

“Oh my god, Mike.” Ten over one hundred. “I’m okay.” 

His voice was calm, but stern. “Are you bleeding?” 

I checked myself again. Just the bruise on my neck. A scrape on my forehead that had already scabbed over. “No.” 

“Was there anyone else in the car with you?” 

“Mike! It was obviously just me!” I didn’t mean to snap at him. Again. I was on edge. The precipice of a razorblade. 

“I’m trying to get a clear picture, right now, Laura. That’s all. Do you feel dizzy? Is your vision blurry?” 

I blinked. “I think I have a small concussion. I’m okay, really.” 

He sighed. “No, you’re not. You need to get that checked out, right away.” 

“Mike! What the fuck happened? Why did you call me?” I squinted, trying to physically recall what happened before my accident with the man in the fog. “Did I hear you yell?”

He hesitated. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I thought I saw Stewart’s lips move.” 

I sat up in my seat. 

“Did you catch what he was saying?” 

“Laura, I don’t know. I don’t know what I saw. I’m more concerned about you.” 

“Mike. What did he say?” 

He took an even longer time to answer. When he finally did, I sat in my car for a long time, still by the side of the highway, watching the shadows. Counting numbers in my head. Thinking. 

“I thought… I thought I saw him mouth ‘help’.”",1,1770847491.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1r2b63i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r2b63i/the_simian_problem_part_1/,The Simian Problem (Part 1),"I checked my watch. It was JULY 12, 4:04 PM.

Jerry and Michael were already in the shed, and they were arguing as usual. 

“Why do you always have to be so negative all the time?” 

Michael bit into his meatball sub, squeezing the sides so tightly that I traced the flying glob of tomato sauce flying through the air. His teeth chewed on the hunks of meat in between buns of white bread, biting into the brown stained with sauce, some getting into his beard. “Awl I shed wash he probably doeshn’t dream ‘bout anything.” He swallowed. “What’s your deal?” 

Jerry’s face was equally as red as the tomato sauce. “Why do I have to be so negative–?” He turned to me. “Laura. Back me up here–” 

“Hi, Laura,” Michael interrupted. 

Jerry closed his eyes for a solid four seconds. Keeping his back to Michael, he ran a hand through his balding blond hair, pressing the palm tight against his pale forehead. It reminded me of an ironing board smoothing out the wrinkles on a crusty t-shirt. Jerry opened his eyes. “As I was saying–” 

“What’s up, Mike?” I responded. 

Jerry stomped his foot against the ground. “Fuck! Fuck! God fucking… would you just let me get one fucking word in? I swear to God, I’ll–” He was interrupted again as Mike dropped his sub to the floor, striding over to Jerry in two efficient steps, then using his own boot to crush down on Jerry’s stomping foot. Before Jerry could yell any further, Make clamped a hand over Jerry’s mouth, smearing a little sauce on Jerry’s round face. Mike held up a finger to his own mouth, shushing him.

I looked at Mike’s alarmed expression, then towards the window of the shack. 

The supply shack was about the size of a small garage. Big for a shed. Huge for a shed out here. Definitely fine enough for our purposes. It was made of pieces of rusted tin, hammered together to form four walls once painted a deep green. An automatic light hung outside the small door on the far side of the room, though its bulb had been removed long ago. The wall facing the street had small windows near the ceiling, allowing some sunlight to drift onto the concrete floor. The floor sloped downward against that same wall, more cracks and warps contributing to the dirtstained concrete until it reached a near vertical angle, stopping when it reached the very foundation of the wall. 

We waited in silence, Mike slowly removing his hands away from Jerry’s face. I crept over to the corner, grabbing a roll of paper towels from the carpenter’s table. While I scooped up the splattered sandwich, Mike creaked the door open. We all collectively grimaced, covering our dark-adjusted eyes. A gust of wind blew the short black hair on his forward, plastering it to his pale forehead. It tickled his beard, still stained with tomato sauce. Underneath his red baseball cap, his brown eyes scanned back and forth, then he stepped outside, inching the door shut behind him. 

Jerry leaned in to whisper: “I’m just saying, Laura, don’t you think Bob here… like, don’t you think he dreams?” 

“Stop talking, Jerry,” I replied, my eyes glued to the door. If I could will my ears to perk like an animal’s, I would.

He finally shut his mouth. 

We could hear Mike walking outside, his feet echoing off the driveway. He walked once around the shed, then paused at the door. He began to open it, his shadow spilling into the unilluminated room, then stopped, apparently reconsidering. He closed the door again, walking once more around the shed. I even heard him walk down the driveway, towards the street out front, before finally returning, definitively closing the door shut behind him as he re-entered the shed. 

Mike took a toothpick out from his green-gray duck chore coat, jaw flexing as he chewed on the tip. 

I gently placed the sub remains inside a trash bag, then tied it shut, setting it down next to the door so no one would forget to take it with them later. 

Jerry appeared unfazed. “Anyway,” he continued. “I was just saying that I think Bob, here–” 

“I thought we agreed on Stewart,” Michael grunted. 

“Fine. Stewart. Don’t you think he dreams?”

I looked at Stewart’s operating table. The shiny metal slab took up most of the room, sitting on locked wheels and holding up the body of the comatose man. He had deep brown hair, parted to the right. Stubble had grown over his tan face, and his narrow eyes darted frantically around his surroundings behind closed eyelids. I moved closer, shifting his body a little away from the edge of the table. Recoiling as I got near his diaper, I turned my nose away. 

Moving as quickly as I could, I took a syringe from my left pocket, and a vial of clear liquid from the other. I poked the needle through the lid, filling the syringe to the brim. I tapped the side, the metal *plinking* against my fingernail, as I cleared away the excess drips. Nodding to Jerry, he wordlessly crossed over to my side of the table, recoiling at the smell, too, as he held down Stewart’s arm to keep it as still as possible. Mike handed me a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol, and I swabbed the skin over a twisting, blue vein. Leaning in close, I sunk the needle into the skin at an angle, letting the tip enter Stewart’s bloodstream. 

I looked at Jerry and Michael as I drained the needle into him. “Isn’t the whole point that he does dream?” 

Jerry wrung his hands. “THANK YOU!” 

Michael rolled his eyes. “I meant, I don’t think he’s conscious of his dreams. Like, isn’t there a whole study that says you always dream when you sleep, but you pretty much never remember the majority of them?” 

“What difference does that make?” Jerry spluttered. “If he’s dreaming, he’s dreaming! I swear, you’re just disagreeing with me because it– it pleases you to be nihilistic. You always have to have the opposite opinion of me. Like, Laura, I think Stewart’s dreaming of a field of butterflies, and Michael…” 

“I think he’s experiencing what it’s like to be in the womb. Just some floating spirit not even aware of what the hell’s going on.” Michael finished. A shadow crossed his face. “But I’m not a nihilist.” 

I slid the needle out and placed it in a water basin. Then I picked up the copy of the Bible sitting on the shelf by the rusting metal door. I whacked both of them on the head with it before they could react. 

Jerry rubbed his head. “Hey!” 

“One of you needs to change his diaper. I did it yesterday.” 

Jerry and Mike looked at each other. They held out their hands for rock, paper, scissors. Mike was rock, Jerry was scissors. 

“Best of three?” Jerry tried. Mike shoved a clean diaper into his arms. Jerry sighed. He snapped on a pair of medical gloves and covered his face with a mask. I reached into the sink, squirting dish soap onto a yellow sponge before carefully running it over the needle. I kept the water pressure at a low, wishing again that I had access to better disinfectants. Michael fished his smartphone out of his pocket, turning the volume down to one before selecting an app that was playing the news. 

Over the quiet trickle of running water, I could just barely make out the reporter’s voice coming out from the phone’s speaker. “More bodies in Jordan as alleged border disputes with The United Arab Emirates escalates to an unprecedented–” Mike swiped, switching to a different news station. “--Twenty-three Texas school children dead in Tentuskiville shooting–” Swipe. “--Kremlin officials deny ethnic cleansing allegations made by six members of the U.N. Security Council in regards to the Russian controlled state of–” Swipe. “--Refugees escaping in droves as more of the Mediterranean coastline is swallowed by rising sea levels. When asked if any cities in the United States would be made sanctuaries, the president responded–”

Mike stared at his reflection in the black screen of his phone. Jerry sniffed, eyes frozen on Stewart. He whispered something under his breath. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Piece of shit,” He said again, a little louder. Jerry threw the diaper into the bag, then laid trembling hands on the edge of the operating table. “Piece of shit!” He started shaking it violently, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with red. 

“Jerry!” I shouted. Mike and I locked eyes, and we rushed to Jerry’s side, tackling him to the floor. Jerry was still thrashing violently, teeth gritted and palms sweating. Mike squeezed his arm around his mouth, trying to stop him from making any noise. 

“Shh!” He hissed.

I held Jerry’s other arm down, pressing it against the cold, uneven concrete floor. Then he kicked his foot, hitting the leg of the table. It began to roll across the room, down a steady downwards slope. 

We immediately dropped Jerry, rushing to intercept the speeding table. I grabbed its side, grunting as I tried to keep the metal slab with the heavier man on top from sliding any further. Mike dashed to the other side, pulling it with his arms. Stewart’s body slid precariously to the edge, almost rolling over on top of me. I reached my arms up, steadying the man. We rolled the table back into place, Michael edging Stewart back to his position in the center. 

This time, it was my turn to check outside. 

The sun beat down on me as soon as I stepped out the door. I squinted, trying to see anything past the glare of the day. Even though the sun was low in the sky, there were no houses to block it from blinding me. I began to slowly circle the shed, looking around me at the miles of the same old overgrown, abandoned development project. It was the outline of a neighborhood, with sun-stained sidewalks, cracked driveways, and empty foundations. There were no cars, though. No wires, no telephone poles, streetlamps, houses, or thankfully, people. The shed itself sat on an identical lot filled with weeds and scattered bushes. My guess was that this belonged to someone before the land even started development. And it was still here after. 

I wasn’t as paranoid as Mike. I elected to only walk around the shed once. In the far distance, beyond the concrete nothingness, I could see the grove of trees where we parked our cars, though the vehicles themselves were hidden from my line of sight. If anyone had heard our noises, they were either hiding over there, or they weren’t here at all. There was no possible way to sneak up on us in this place. 

That didn’t stop us from being careful. 

When I came back inside, Jerry was still on the floor, hugging his knees. He looked tearfully at Mike and I. “Is he still asleep?” 

I approached the operating table. Stewart’s eyes were still closed, still rapidly moving underneath his eyelids. I walked around, gently gripping his head as I used my other hand to lay two fingers on his neck. I nodded to Mike, who raised his arm, checking his watch. I felt the thumping of Stewart’s heart, and I closed my eyes, counting in my head. Jerry drew in a long breath, then got up, moving towards the basin, where he picked up the needle, holding the bottle at the ready. 

The watch beeped. Mike looked up at me. 

“Thirty-nine BPM. Still asleep.”

Mike breathed a sigh of relief. Jerry slumped over, holding his head in his hands. 

I pulled up a stool, releasing a long exhale through my nose. I sat down, letting my shoulders sag. Even as my posture relaxed, I couldn’t help but let my head trail up, looking past the operating table with the still-asleep Stewart, past Jerry, who was lying on the floor and staring straight up at the water-damaged ceiling, and past Mike, who was finishing putting on the diaper. My eyes fell past all of them and onto the space just above the doorway to the shed, to the message scrawled messily in red paint. The one I forced myself to look at every single day.

WE ARE BETTER OFF WITH HIM ASLEEP. 

Later, I checked my watch. It was JULY 12, 7:33 PM.

I muttered a goodbye to Mike and Jerry, then I started the four block walk to my car. Even though it was past seven, it was still ninety-six degrees out.  I rubbed sunscreen on my face as I walked, shoes slapping against the sidewalk pavement. My arm brushed the dead bush that lay at the end of the walkway to the shed, then I turned right, onto the street. Cicadas drowned out the sounds of the birds in the trees. I looked behind, and saw Jerry leaning against the shed wall, brushing a sweaty strand of hair out from his face. Even though we both had nightshifts, he wouldn’t leave for at least another thirty minutes. It was important to stagger our departures. 

The sun wasn’t radiating light over the abandoned lots anymore. The gray shade of the evening permeated the empty development project, now. My shadow, split into two, blackened the already black concrete. I reached into my purse, feeling the cool lenses of the sunglasses tossed inside. Even when I was here in the middle of the day, I never liked wearing them out here. The dark tint felt like it was hiding someone. Crouching in the bushes, waiting for me to be all alone. A someone that had somehow walked all the way out here to the center of nothingness, avoided all of our regular checks outside, whose purpose was to keep themselves impossibly hidden, watching us. Waiting. 

Our cars were scattered around the lone patch of grass amongst the oak trees. Mike’s black SUV, my own white sedan, and Jerry’s shining metal cybertruck. Real inconspicuous. 

I opened the driver’s side door to my own car, turning the key in the ignition and immediately switching on the AC. I closed the door, waiting outside as the car cooled. Whatever hellish temperature it was out here, it was always going to be twenty degrees higher in the car. My phone rang, and I immediately picked it up. 

Mike’s voice sounded tired. “Ready to keep going?” 

“Put me on with him.” 

“Alright.” I heard shuffling, and then Mike said, sounding further away: “Go ahead.” 

I tried to put on the calm, reassuring voice I used with the residents at Shady Grove. “Hi, Stewart. Can you hear me?” 

There was no answer, as expected. I heard his quiet breathing through the speaker. Mike must’ve placed the phone pretty close to his face today. As if the centimeter difference to his brain would make matter. I thought it would be best to make it seem like we were having a normal conversation, even if it was one-sided. If he could hear me in there, it would be good to establish a relationship of trust. 

“You’re speaking to Laura, right now. Are you having a pleasant dream?” 

I let my question hang in the air. Sandwiching my phone between my shoulder and ear, I fished out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth as I got out the matches. The first one was a dud. I dropped the spent match on the ground, digging it in with my heel, then realized what I had done. 

“Shit.” I kneeled down, trying not to get my uniform dirty. 

“Laura?” Mike’s voice was still far away. “All good?” 

“Yup. Yeah, Mike,” I said, grabbing the match from the grass. I opened the door, sliding into the driver’s seat as I flicked the match into a plastic bag tied around the gear stick. Connecting the call to the vehicle’s bluetooth, I started pulling out of my parking spot.

“Stewart,” I continued. “I ask about your dream because I wanted to talk to you about something called lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? Instead of the foggy memory of your dream after you wake up, you can become aware of the dream while you’re… well, while you’re in it.” 

I backed out onto the road, swinging a left and accelerating. “And some people who lucid dream, like, who realize that they’re dreaming while they’re still in the dream, can actually control what happens in it. So you could do whatever you want, Stewart. You could fly. You could relive your childhood memories.” I checked my rearview mirror. “You could even talk… um, you could even talk…” 

I heard Mike breathe through his nose. “Laura, this isn’t going to work.” 

“Isn’t it worth trying?” I asked. 

“We’ve been doing this every single day. Aren’t you getting tired? God, I mean, I can hear it in your voice. What was that?” 

“It’s just hard, okay?” I snapped, not meaning to sound as irritable as my tone came out, but it’d been a long day, and it was just getting started. As usual. “This whole thing is crazy. Excuse me if it's a little hard to spit out.” 

Michael didn’t say anything. I mentally chided myself, watching the abandoned lots give away to the sight of the groundlevel freeway. We couldn’t let cracks form. Not now. Not after so long, and so little time left. 

I let ourselves sit in silence for a little while. The truth was, we had no idea if any of this was getting to Stewart. We thought that Stewart’s brain activity was normal. A patient in comatose might be able to hear communication from the outside world, depending on if their brain was still functioning as intended. It was impossible to tell for Stewart, except for the fact that he was still alive. Yeah, I could get basic tools like syringes from Shady Grove, but nothing close to something like an MRI machine. 

As I entered the highway, Mike’s voice resonated through the car. “Are we going to talk about Jerry?” 

 “What’s there to talk about?” 

“You know what.”

“It’s an emotional job, Mike.” 

“No, you get emotional. Jerry–”

“Excuse me?” I said, looking wide-eyed at the phone symbol on the car screen. 

“I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean, your behavior around this– mine, too– that’s normal. We’re bound to get a little stir-crazy from time-to-time, but we keep going, y’know? But stir-crazy is one thing. Going ape-shit on the guy that’s supposed to stay asleep no matter what is another.” 

I watched the light get lower in the sky as mist began to settle on the road. Luckily there were no cars around, but I found myself thankful that I had actually gotten my ass to the mechanic last week to get my low beams fixed. My talk with Mike was beginning to feel like a conversation I had with one of the residents. I forced my voice to be patient. “I’ve seen what we’re giving him in action. If a fraction of that is enough to lull a crazy old bitch to a gentle nap, Stewart wouldn’t wake for the end of the world with what he’s getting.” 

“It’s not just that. What if someone heard?” Mike replied. 

“Who’s going to hear?”

“You never know. Besides–” 

His voice said something loud, maybe urgent. But… what was that? There was something on the road in front me. A pair of white lights, two pinpricks much too small to belong to a car. They stared at me in the other lane as I loosened my foot on the gas. They shone through the fog, piercing through the rolling haze like the sun entering a cave. But this was cold. My eyes were unable to blink as I shivered uncontrollably. Stings of pain began to blot out my vision, tears streaming down my face. I felt the groans of the highway underneath me as I entered the lane separation, the vehicular concrete clawing at the hot rubber of my wheels telling me to turn back. 

The lights were eyes. Terrible, blinding eyes, the result of two needles taken to thick black construction paper and held in front of a brilliant lantern. And the fog was crawling into my car, tendrils of it seeping through the miniscule gap in my windows, foggy fingers groping from within the depths of the air conditioning vent, pure, frosty terror creeping from the crack in my windshield. My fingers burned with cold, feeling frozen to the steering wheel. But my arms slowly turned it. Creeping towards the black silhouette with the white eyes with sickening odyssean lust. 

The black silhouette was crouched, eyes boring into mine. Not even my very, very close headlights could illuminate their features. But I could see their current height well superseding my car. At least six feet tall. Like a shadow manifest. A cold, black shadow. The sky without stars. 

Turn back. Turn back. 

My vision cleared. I swung the wheel the opposite direction, almost snapping my arm with the force of my whiplash. The car squealed, and burning rubber filled my nose, making me gag. I slammed the gas, driving, driving. The fog was so thick. Mike was saying something, but the bluetooth was distorted. It cut off his sentences, leaving periods of silence intercut with hoarse, gasping breaths. 

“Mike,” I rasped, feeling like I needed to cough. “M–”

My car slammed into the broad trunk of a tree. My phone toppled from the cupholder, falling flat on the floor of the car and ending the call. My head slammed forward with the impact, hitting the steering wheel before my airbag activated. A shrill ringing filled my ears. For a second, I had to fight myself to stay awake. I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. I felt sick, vomit threatening to spill through my throat, simultaneously as my head throbbed. 

I sat up, ignoring the possible concussion I had sustained. I took a deep breath, slowly blinking to steady my vision. My windshield was cracked, well, even more than it already had been.  The hood of my car was crumpled like a tin can. 

“Fuck,” I whispered, stifling a sob. 

How the hell was I gonna afford a new car? My salary was already a fucking joke. I had bills to pay. Groceries to buy. And… 

Had that really happened? 

I turned the car off, not that it really mattered anymore. Pushing the airbag out of the way, I groped around the dark car for my phone. Picking it up, I ran my thumb along its shattered screen. At least it still turned on. I thought about what I would do next. As far as I knew, there weren’t any other cars on the road, and definitely no speed cameras. No one had seen what had just happened. I hung up an incoming call from Mike. Time to get out and ring AAA. 

I reached for the door handle, then stopped. There were noises on the roof of the car. 

They were loud, banging one after the other, in slow, rhythmic succession. It sounded like footsteps. I waited to hear them hop onto the back of the trunk, then onto the road. I even craned my neck, wincing at a bruise that had developed right below my ear. But I didn’t see them. In fact, the footsteps didn’t stop. They circled on top of the car. 

My heart began to pound, and I released my breath, not realizing I had been holding it. I absorbed every minute detail of my car. The white cushion of the airbag protruded from the steering wheel. An old coffee cup had fallen to the ground, cold liquid dripping onto the carpeted floor. In the back row was my black duffel bag, inside it was some extra vials of what we fed Stewart, and his IV bag. We planned to transition him to the drip diet once we got some more supplies. For now, we did our best by forcing blended food down his throat. Mike always had a crash bag ready if he started choking. 

I looked out the back window, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the perfect dark. Waiting to see whoever was on my roof appear on the other side. 

My phone rang. 

The blue lit up the entire car. I saw Mike’s name appear like a prehistoric blaze of fire. I gasped as the beating of my chest skipped a hundred years. I heard a tap and I looked and I saw the black silhouette of someone with white glowing eyes peering down at me perched on the roof of my car penetrating and looking into my head with curiosity and unknowability and something that felt like the cold pangs of hunger jab into the inside of my spine. My scream drowned out the phone’s ringtone and the stranger shot their head back. I heard a slam, saw my car’s roof crunch downwards, felt myself close my eyes. 

I knew it could only have been a few seconds later when I opened them. The phone was still ringing. I looked out the window. Nothing. I listened. The roof was quiet. Dazed, I groped around on the floor, taking a few tries before my trembling hands picked the phone up. I slid the answer bar to the right. 

“Laura? Laura, are you there?” Mike sounded panicked. 

I swallowed. “Y-” My voice came out too quiet. “Yeah. Yeah.” Instinctively, I felt my pulse. 

“Laura, I swear to god I fucking saw–” He cut himself off. “Wait, what happened? Are you okay? Did I hear something on your end? You hung up on me.” 

“Um… yeah.” I tried to keep myself calm, focusing on counting the pulse rate. “I got into an accident.” 

“Oh, my god. Are you okay?” Mike’s voice became flat. Neutral. “I’m going to need you to answer my questions for me, okay, Laura?” 

“Oh my god, Mike.” Ten over one hundred. “I’m okay.” 

His voice was calm, but stern. “Are you bleeding?” 

I checked myself again. Just the bruise on my neck. A scrape on my forehead that had already scabbed over. “No.” 

“Was there anyone else in the car with you?” 

“Mike! It was obviously just me!” I didn’t mean to snap at him. Again. I was on edge. The precipice of a razorblade. 

“I’m trying to get a clear picture, right now, Laura. That’s all. Do you feel dizzy? Is your vision blurry?” 

I blinked. “I think I have a small concussion. I’m okay, really.” 

He sighed. “No, you’re not. You need to get that checked out, right away.” 

“Mike! What the fuck happened? Why did you call me?” I squinted, trying to physically recall what happened before my accident with the man in the fog. “Did I hear you yell?”

He hesitated. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I thought I saw Stewart’s lips move.” 

I sat up in my seat. 

“Did you catch what he was saying?” 

“Laura, I don’t know. I don’t know what I saw. I’m more concerned about you.” 

“Mike. What did he say?” 

He took an even longer time to answer. When he finally did, I sat in my car for a long time, still by the side of the highway, watching the shadows. Counting numbers in my head. Thinking. 

“I thought… I thought I saw him mouth ‘help’.”",2,1770847474.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I’ve been working remotely for a while now, and one thing that always bothered me was the ""Daily Standup"" meeting. It often felt like 30 minutes of listening to things that didn't affect my work, just for a 2-minute update.

I wanted something that:

1. Kept the team aligned without the synchronous time sink.
2. Let me catch up on updates while away from my desk.

So I built [Standuply](https://standuply.vercel.app/). It’s a simple web app for collected Yesterday/Today/Blocker reports.

**Coolest features I added recently:**

* 🎤 **Voice-to-Text:** You can record your update on the go. Great for when you're just starting your day or away from the keyboard.
* 🎧 **Voice Playback:** The dashboard has a ""Listen"" button for every teammate's update. I’ve started using it like a ""morning news briefing"" for my team while I grab my first coffee.

**Other bits:**

* Automated email digests for team leads/clients.
* Smart reminders so nobody forgets to post.
* Dashboard to see who’s missing and what the blockers are.

I’m really looking for some feedback—specifically on the voice features. Is voice recording something you’d actually use for updates, or is it a bit too much?

It’s completely free to check out, and I'd love to hear what you think of the flow.

Jerry and Michael were already in the shed, and they were arguing as usual. 

“Why do you always have to be so negative all the time?” 

Michael bit into his meatball sub, squeezing the sides so tightly that I traced the flying glob of tomato sauce flying through the air. His teeth chewed on the hunks of meat in between buns of white bread, biting into the brown stained with sauce, some getting into his beard. “Awl I shed wash he probably doeshn’t dream ‘bout anything.” He swallowed. “What’s your deal?” 

Jerry’s face was equally as red as the tomato sauce. “Why do I have to be so negative–?” He turned to me. “Laura. Back me up here–” 

“Hi, Laura,” Michael interrupted. 

Jerry closed his eyes for a solid four seconds. Keeping his back to Michael, he ran a hand through his balding blond hair, pressing the palm tight against his pale forehead. It reminded me of an ironing board smoothing out the wrinkles on a crusty t-shirt. Jerry opened his eyes. “As I was saying–” 

“What’s up, Mike?” I responded. 

Jerry stomped his foot against the ground. “Fuck! Fuck! God fucking… would you just let me get one fucking word in? I swear to God, I’ll–” He was interrupted again as Mike dropped his sub to the floor, striding over to Jerry in two efficient steps, then using his own boot to crush down on Jerry’s stomping foot. Before Jerry could yell any further, Make clamped a hand over Jerry’s mouth, smearing a little sauce on Jerry’s round face. Mike held up a finger to his own mouth, shushing him.

I looked at Mike’s alarmed expression, then towards the window of the shack. 

The supply shack was about the size of a small garage. Big for a shed. Huge for a shed out here. Definitely fine enough for our purposes. It was made of pieces of rusted tin, hammered together to form four walls once painted a deep green. An automatic light hung outside the small door on the far side of the room, though its bulb had been removed long ago. The wall facing the street had small windows near the ceiling, allowing some sunlight to drift onto the concrete floor. The floor sloped downward against that same wall, more cracks and warps contributing to the dirtstained concrete until it reached a near vertical angle, stopping when it reached the very foundation of the wall. 

We waited in silence, Mike slowly removing his hands away from Jerry’s face. I crept over to the corner, grabbing a roll of paper towels from the carpenter’s table. While I scooped up the splattered sandwich, Mike creaked the door open. We all collectively grimaced, covering our dark-adjusted eyes. A gust of wind blew the short black hair on his forward, plastering it to his pale forehead. It tickled his beard, still stained with tomato sauce. Underneath his red baseball cap, his brown eyes scanned back and forth, then he stepped outside, inching the door shut behind him. 

Jerry leaned in to whisper: “I’m just saying, Laura, don’t you think Bob here… like, don’t you think he dreams?” 

“Stop talking, Jerry,” I replied, my eyes glued to the door. If I could will my ears to perk like an animal’s, I would.

He finally shut his mouth. 

We could hear Mike walking outside, his feet echoing off the driveway. He walked once around the shed, then paused at the door. He began to open it, his shadow spilling into the unilluminated room, then stopped, apparently reconsidering. He closed the door again, walking once more around the shed. I even heard him walk down the driveway, towards the street out front, before finally returning, definitively closing the door shut behind him as he re-entered the shed. 

Mike took a toothpick out from his green-gray duck chore coat, jaw flexing as he chewed on the tip. 

I gently placed the sub remains inside a trash bag, then tied it shut, setting it down next to the door so no one would forget to take it with them later. 

Jerry appeared unfazed. “Anyway,” he continued. “I was just saying that I think Bob, here–” 

“I thought we agreed on Stewart,” Michael grunted. 

“Fine. Stewart. Don’t you think he dreams?”

I looked at Stewart’s operating table. The shiny metal slab took up most of the room, sitting on locked wheels and holding up the body of the comatose man. He had deep brown hair, parted to the right. Stubble had grown over his tan face, and his narrow eyes darted frantically around his surroundings behind closed eyelids. I moved closer, shifting his body a little away from the edge of the table. Recoiling as I got near his diaper, I turned my nose away. 

Moving as quickly as I could, I took a syringe from my left pocket, and a vial of clear liquid from the other. I poked the needle through the lid, filling the syringe to the brim. I tapped the side, the metal *plinking* against my fingernail, as I cleared away the excess drips. Nodding to Jerry, he wordlessly crossed over to my side of the table, recoiling at the smell, too, as he held down Stewart’s arm to keep it as still as possible. Mike handed me a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol, and I swabbed the skin over a twisting, blue vein. Leaning in close, I sunk the needle into the skin at an angle, letting the tip enter Stewart’s bloodstream. 

I looked at Jerry and Michael as I drained the needle into him. “Isn’t the whole point that he does dream?” 

Jerry wrung his hands. “THANK YOU!” 

Michael rolled his eyes. “I meant, I don’t think he’s conscious of his dreams. Like, isn’t there a whole study that says you always dream when you sleep, but you pretty much never remember the majority of them?” 

“What difference does that make?” Jerry spluttered. “If he’s dreaming, he’s dreaming! I swear, you’re just disagreeing with me because it– it pleases you to be nihilistic. You always have to have the opposite opinion of me. Like, Laura, I think Stewart’s dreaming of a field of butterflies, and Michael…” 

“I think he’s experiencing what it’s like to be in the womb. Just some floating spirit not even aware of what the hell’s going on.” Michael finished. A shadow crossed his face. “But I’m not a nihilist.” 

I slid the needle out and placed it in a water basin. Then I picked up the copy of the Bible sitting on the shelf by the rusting metal door. I whacked both of them on the head with it before they could react. 

Jerry rubbed his head. “Hey!” 

“One of you needs to change his diaper. I did it yesterday.” 

Jerry and Mike looked at each other. They held out their hands for rock, paper, scissors. Mike was rock, Jerry was scissors. 

“Best of three?” Jerry tried. Mike shoved a clean diaper into his arms. Jerry sighed. He snapped on a pair of medical gloves and covered his face with a mask. I reached into the sink, squirting dish soap onto a yellow sponge before carefully running it over the needle. I kept the water pressure at a low, wishing again that I had access to better disinfectants. Michael fished his smartphone out of his pocket, turning the volume down to one before selecting an app that was playing the news. 

Over the quiet trickle of running water, I could just barely make out the reporter’s voice coming out from the phone’s speaker. “More bodies in Jordan as alleged border disputes with The United Arab Emirates escalates to an unprecedented–” Mike swiped, switching to a different news station. “--Twenty-three Texas school children dead in Tentuskiville shooting–” Swipe. “--Kremlin officials deny ethnic cleansing allegations made by six members of the U.N. Security Council in regards to the Russian controlled state of–” Swipe. “--Refugees escaping in droves as more of the Mediterranean coastline is swallowed by rising sea levels. When asked if any cities in the United States would be made sanctuaries, the president responded–”

Mike stared at his reflection in the black screen of his phone. Jerry sniffed, eyes frozen on Stewart. He whispered something under his breath. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Piece of shit,” He said again, a little louder. Jerry threw the diaper into the bag, then laid trembling hands on the edge of the operating table. “Piece of shit!” He started shaking it violently, cheeks flushed and eyes rimmed with red. 

“Jerry!” I shouted. Mike and I locked eyes, and we rushed to Jerry’s side, tackling him to the floor. Jerry was still thrashing violently, teeth gritted and palms sweating. Mike squeezed his arm around his mouth, trying to stop him from making any noise. 

“Shh!” He hissed.

I held Jerry’s other arm down, pressing it against the cold, uneven concrete floor. Then he kicked his foot, hitting the leg of the table. It began to roll across the room, down a steady downwards slope. 

We immediately dropped Jerry, rushing to intercept the speeding table. I grabbed its side, grunting as I tried to keep the metal slab with the heavier man on top from sliding any further. Mike dashed to the other side, pulling it with his arms. Stewart’s body slid precariously to the edge, almost rolling over on top of me. I reached my arms up, steadying the man. We rolled the table back into place, Michael edging Stewart back to his position in the center. 

This time, it was my turn to check outside. 

The sun beat down on me as soon as I stepped out the door. I squinted, trying to see anything past the glare of the day. Even though the sun was low in the sky, there were no houses to block it from blinding me. I began to slowly circle the shed, looking around me at the miles of the same old overgrown, abandoned development project. It was the outline of a neighborhood, with sun-stained sidewalks, cracked driveways, and empty foundations. There were no cars, though. No wires, no telephone poles, streetlamps, houses, or thankfully, people. The shed itself sat on an identical lot filled with weeds and scattered bushes. My guess was that this belonged to someone before the land even started development. And it was still here after. 

I wasn’t as paranoid as Mike. I elected to only walk around the shed once. In the far distance, beyond the concrete nothingness, I could see the grove of trees where we parked our cars, though the vehicles themselves were hidden from my line of sight. If anyone had heard our noises, they were either hiding over there, or they weren’t here at all. There was no possible way to sneak up on us in this place. 

That didn’t stop us from being careful. 

When I came back inside, Jerry was still on the floor, hugging his knees. He looked tearfully at Mike and I. “Is he still asleep?” 

I approached the operating table. Stewart’s eyes were still closed, still rapidly moving underneath his eyelids. I walked around, gently gripping his head as I used my other hand to lay two fingers on his neck. I nodded to Mike, who raised his arm, checking his watch. I felt the thumping of Stewart’s heart, and I closed my eyes, counting in my head. Jerry drew in a long breath, then got up, moving towards the basin, where he picked up the needle, holding the bottle at the ready. 

The watch beeped. Mike looked up at me. 

“Thirty-nine BPM. Still asleep.”

Mike breathed a sigh of relief. Jerry slumped over, holding his head in his hands. 

I pulled up a stool, releasing a long exhale through my nose. I sat down, letting my shoulders sag. Even as my posture relaxed, I couldn’t help but let my head trail up, looking past the operating table with the still-asleep Stewart, past Jerry, who was lying on the floor and staring straight up at the water-damaged ceiling, and past Mike, who was finishing putting on the diaper. My eyes fell past all of them and onto the space just above the doorway to the shed, to the message scrawled messily in red paint. The one I forced myself to look at every single day.

WE ARE BETTER OFF WITH HIM ASLEEP. 

# JULY 12. 7:33 PM. 

I muttered a goodbye to Mike and Jerry, then I started the four block walk to my car. Even though it was past seven, it was still ninety-six degrees out.  I rubbed sunscreen on my face as I walked, shoes slapping against the sidewalk pavement. My arm brushed the dead bush that lay at the end of the walkway to the shed, then I turned right, onto the street. Cicadas drowned out the sounds of the birds in the trees. I looked behind, and saw Jerry leaning against the shed wall, brushing a sweaty strand of hair out from his face. Even though we both had nightshifts, he wouldn’t leave for at least another thirty minutes. It was important to stagger our departures. 

The sun wasn’t radiating light over the abandoned lots anymore. The gray shade of the evening permeated the empty development project, now. My shadow, split into two, blackened the already black concrete. I reached into my purse, feeling the cool lenses of the sunglasses tossed inside. Even when I was here in the middle of the day, I never liked wearing them out here. The dark tint felt like it was hiding someone. Crouching in the bushes, waiting for me to be all alone. A someone that had somehow walked all the way out here to the center of nothingness, avoided all of our regular checks outside, whose purpose was to keep themselves impossibly hidden, watching us. Waiting. 

Our cars were scattered around the lone patch of grass amongst the oak trees. Mike’s black SUV, my own white sedan, and Jerry’s shining metal cybertruck. Real inconspicuous. 

I opened the driver’s side door to my own car, turning the key in the ignition and immediately switching on the AC. I closed the door, waiting outside as the car cooled. Whatever hellish temperature it was out here, it was always going to be twenty degrees higher in the car. My phone rang, and I immediately picked it up. 

Mike’s voice sounded tired. “Ready to keep going?” 

“Put me on with him.” 

“Alright.” I heard shuffling, and then Mike said, sounding further away: “Go ahead.” 

I tried to put on the calm, reassuring voice I used with the residents at Shady Grove. “Hi, Stewart. Can you hear me?” 

There was no answer, as expected. I heard his quiet breathing through the speaker. Mike must’ve placed the phone pretty close to his face today. As if the centimeter difference to his brain would make matter. I thought it would be best to make it seem like we were having a normal conversation, even if it was one-sided. If he could hear me in there, it would be good to establish a relationship of trust. 

“You’re speaking to Laura, right now. Are you having a pleasant dream?” 

I let my question hang in the air. Sandwiching my phone between my shoulder and ear, I fished out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth as I got out the matches. The first one was a dud. I dropped the spent match on the ground, digging it in with my heel, then realized what I had done. 

“Shit.” I kneeled down, trying not to get my uniform dirty. 

“Laura?” Mike’s voice was still far away. “All good?” 

“Yup. Yeah, Mike,” I said, grabbing the match from the grass. I opened the door, sliding into the driver’s seat as I flicked the match into a plastic bag tied around the gear stick. Connecting the call to the vehicle’s bluetooth, I started pulling out of my parking spot.

“Stewart,” I continued. “I ask about your dream because I wanted to talk to you about something called lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? Instead of the foggy memory of your dream after you wake up, you can become aware of the dream while you’re… well, while you’re in it.” 

I backed out onto the road, swinging a left and accelerating. “And some people who lucid dream, like, who realize that they’re dreaming while they’re still in the dream, can actually control what happens in it. So you could do whatever you want, Stewart. You could fly. You could relive your childhood memories.” I checked my rearview mirror. “You could even talk… um, you could even talk…” 

I heard Mike breathe through his nose. “Laura, this isn’t going to work.” 

“Isn’t it worth trying?” I asked. 

“We’ve been doing this every single day. Aren’t you getting tired? God, I mean, I can hear it in your voice. What was that?” 

“It’s just hard, okay?” I snapped, not meaning to sound as irritable as my tone came out, but it’d been a long day, and it was just getting started. As usual. “This whole thing is crazy. Excuse me if it's a little hard to spit out.” 

Michael didn’t say anything. I mentally chided myself, watching the abandoned lots give away to the sight of the groundlevel freeway. We couldn’t let cracks form. Not now. Not after so long, and so little time left. 

I let ourselves sit in silence for a little while. The truth was, we had no idea if any of this was getting to Stewart. We thought that Stewart’s brain activity was normal. A patient in comatose might be able to hear communication from the outside world, depending on if their brain was still functioning as intended. It was impossible to tell for Stewart, except for the fact that he was still alive. Yeah, I could get basic tools like syringes from Shady Grove, but nothing close to something like an MRI machine. 

As I entered the highway, Mike’s voice resonated through the car. “Are we going to talk about Jerry?” 

 “What’s there to talk about?” 

“You know what.”

“It’s an emotional job, Mike.” 

“No, you get emotional. Jerry–”

“Excuse me?” I said, looking wide-eyed at the phone symbol on the car screen. 

“I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean, your behavior around this– mine, too– that’s normal. We’re bound to get a little stir-crazy from time-to-time, but we keep going, y’know? But stir-crazy is one thing. Going ape-shit on the guy that’s supposed to stay asleep no matter what is another.” 

I watched the light get lower in the sky as mist began to settle on the road. Luckily there were no cars around, but I found myself thankful that I had actually gotten my ass to the mechanic last week to get my low beams fixed. My talk with Mike was beginning to feel like a conversation I had with one of the residents. I forced my voice to be patient. “I’ve seen what we’re giving him in action. If a fraction of that is enough to lull a crazy old bitch to a gentle nap, Stewart wouldn’t wake for the end of the world with what he’s getting.” 

“It’s not just that. What if someone heard?” Mike replied. 

“Who’s going to hear?”

“You never know. Besides–” 

His voice said something loud, maybe urgent. But… what was that? There was something on the road in front me. A pair of white lights, two pinpricks much too small to belong to a car. They stared at me in the other lane as I loosened my foot on the gas. They shone through the fog, piercing through the rolling haze like the sun entering a cave. But this was cold. My eyes were unable to blink as I shivered uncontrollably. Stings of pain began to blot out my vision, tears streaming down my face. I felt the groans of the highway underneath me as I entered the lane separation, the vehicular concrete clawing at the hot rubber of my wheels telling me to turn back. 

The lights were eyes. Terrible, blinding eyes, the result of two needles taken to thick black construction paper and held in front of a brilliant lantern. And the fog was crawling into my car, tendrils of it seeping through the miniscule gap in my windows, foggy fingers groping from within the depths of the air conditioning vent, pure, frosty terror creeping from the crack in my windshield. My fingers burned with cold, feeling frozen to the steering wheel. But my arms slowly turned it. Creeping towards the black silhouette with the white eyes with sickening odyssean lust. 

The black silhouette was crouched, eyes boring into mine. Not even my very, very close headlights could illuminate their features. But I could see their current height well superseding my car. At least six feet tall. Like a shadow manifest. A cold, black shadow. The sky without stars. 

Turn back. Turn back. 

My vision cleared. I swung the wheel the opposite direction, almost snapping my arm with the force of my whiplash. The car squealed, and burning rubber filled my nose, making me gag. I slammed the gas, driving, driving. The fog was so thick. Mike was saying something, but the bluetooth was distorted. It cut off his sentences, leaving periods of silence intercut with hoarse, gasping breaths. 

“Mike,” I rasped, feeling like I needed to cough. “M–”

My car slammed into the broad trunk of a tree. My phone toppled from the cupholder, falling flat on the floor of the car and ending the call. My head slammed forward with the impact, hitting the steering wheel before my airbag activated. A shrill ringing filled my ears. For a second, I had to fight myself to stay awake. I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. I felt sick, vomit threatening to spill through my throat, simultaneously as my head throbbed. 

I sat up, ignoring the possible concussion I had sustained. I took a deep breath, slowly blinking to steady my vision. My windshield was cracked, well, even more than it already had been.  The hood of my car was crumpled like a tin can. 

“Fuck,” I whispered, stifling a sob. 

How the hell was I gonna afford a new car? My salary was already a fucking joke. I had bills to pay. Groceries to buy. And… 

Had that really happened? 

I turned the car off, not that it really mattered anymore. Pushing the airbag out of the way, I groped around the dark car for my phone. Picking it up, I ran my thumb along its shattered screen. At least it still turned on. I thought about what I would do next. As far as I knew, there weren’t any other cars on the road, and definitely no speed cameras. No one had seen what had just happened. I hung up an incoming call from Mike. Time to get out and ring AAA. 

I reached for the door handle, then stopped. There were noises on the roof of the car. 

They were loud, banging one after the other, in slow, rhythmic succession. It sounded like footsteps. I waited to hear them hop onto the back of the trunk, then onto the road. I even craned my neck, wincing at a bruise that had developed right below my ear. But I didn’t see them. In fact, the footsteps didn’t stop. They circled on top of the car. 

My heart began to pound, and I released my breath, not realizing I had been holding it. I absorbed every minute detail of my car. The white cushion of the airbag protruded from the steering wheel. An old coffee cup had fallen to the ground, cold liquid dripping onto the carpeted floor. In the back row was my black duffel bag, inside it was some extra vials of what we fed Stewart, and his IV bag. We planned to transition him to the drip diet once we got some more supplies. For now, we did our best by forcing blended food down his throat. Mike always had a crash bag ready if he started choking. 

I looked out the back window, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the perfect dark. Waiting to see whoever was on my roof appear on the other side. 

My phone rang. 

The blue lit up the entire car. I saw Mike’s name appear like a prehistoric blaze of fire. I gasped as the beating of my chest skipped a hundred years. I heard a tap and I looked and I saw the black silhouette of someone with white glowing eyes peering down at me perched on the roof of my car penetrating and looking into my head with curiosity and unknowability and something that felt like the cold pangs of hunger jab into the inside of my spine. My scream drowned out the phone’s ringtone and the stranger shot their head back. I heard a slam, saw my car’s roof crunch downwards, felt myself close my eyes. 

I knew it could only have been a few seconds later when I opened them. The phone was still ringing. I looked out the window. Nothing. I listened. The roof was quiet. Dazed, I groped around on the floor, taking a few tries before my trembling hands picked the phone up. I slid the answer bar to the right. 

“Laura? Laura, are you there?” Mike sounded panicked. 

I swallowed. “Y-” My voice came out too quiet. “Yeah. Yeah.” Instinctively, I felt my pulse. 

“Laura, I swear to god I fucking saw–” He cut himself off. “Wait, what happened? Are you okay? Did I hear something on your end? You hung up on me.” 

“Um… yeah.” I tried to keep myself calm, focusing on counting the pulse rate. “I got into an accident.” 

“Oh, my god. Are you okay?” Mike’s voice became flat. Neutral. “I’m going to need you to answer my questions for me, okay, Laura?” 

“Oh my god, Mike.” Ten over one hundred. “I’m okay.” 

His voice was calm, but stern. “Are you bleeding?” 

I checked myself again. Just the bruise on my neck. A scrape on my forehead that had already scabbed over. “No.” 

“Was there anyone else in the car with you?” 

“Mike! It was obviously just me!” I didn’t mean to snap at him. Again. I was on edge. The precipice of a razorblade. 

“I’m trying to get a clear picture, right now, Laura. That’s all. Do you feel dizzy? Is your vision blurry?” 

I blinked. “I think I have a small concussion. I’m okay, really.” 

He sighed. “No, you’re not. You need to get that checked out, right away.” 

“Mike! What the fuck happened? Why did you call me?” I squinted, trying to physically recall what happened before my accident with the man in the fog. “Did I hear you yell?”

He hesitated. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I thought I saw Stewart’s lips move.” 

I sat up in my seat. 

“Did you catch what he was saying?” 

“Laura, I don’t know. I don’t know what I saw. I’m more concerned about you.” 

“Mike. What did he say?” 

He took an even longer time to answer. When he finally did, I sat in my car for a long time, still by the side of the highway, watching the shadows. Counting numbers in my head. Thinking. 

“I thought… I thought I saw him mouth ‘help’.”",1,1770847454.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1r2b4lu,https://i.redd.it/b5tmtjkfuxig1.jpeg,The Last Birthday I Waited for You (link?),"Chapter 1

On my daughter Emily’s fifth birthday, Madeline Wright posted an intimate photo on her social media.

The caption read: \[My baby missed her daddy before bed, so a good dad rushed over the moment he heard.\]

The man in the photo was my husband, Daniel Carter.

On my phone, a text from ten minutes earlier sat quietly: \[Work emergency. I won’t be home tonight.\]

I calmly liked the photo.

Then I called my divorce lawyer.

\---

Daniel came back at two in the morning.

When the lights flared on, I immediately covered Emily’s eyes.

He leaned against the doorframe. “Honey, I’m back. Wake Emily up. I’ll celebrate her birthday with her.”

I used to care deeply about family rituals.

Birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, even preschool events, I insisted Daniel attend whenever possible.

I didn’t want Emily growing up like me, only seeing her father through a screen.

But now, I smoothed the blanket and said evenly, “There’s no need.”

Impatience flickered across his face.

“Claire, I only went over to help Leo fall asleep. Don’t overthink it.”

“It’s because you’re always suspicious that I don’t dare tell you the truth.”

I wasn’t misunderstanding anything. I wouldn’t be suspicious ever again.

“If you’re done, go to your room,” I said. “Don’t wake Emily. She has school tomorrow.”

Daniel let out a cold laugh.

“Suit yourself. Just don’t complain later that I missed Emily’s childhood.”

I turned off the light and gently patted my daughter, who had been stirred awake.

Missing things didn’t matter anymore.

After all, Emily’s birthday wish this year was, “I don’t want to see Daddy anymore.”

The next morning, Daniel didn’t leave right after breakfast like he usually did.

He sat watching the morning news instead.

Just before heading out, he picked up his keys and walked over, ruffling Emily’s hair.

“I will take you to school today.”

He said it to our daughter, but his eyes were locked on me.

When Emily first started preschool two years ago, Daniel handled drop-off and pickup every day.

After Madeline appeared, he began leaving earlier, claiming the company had moved morning meetings up.

I believed him, until three months ago, when Emily transferred schools and I saw him at the gate.

The man who was supposed to be at work bent down and lifted a little boy out of the back seat.

It turned out he wasn’t too busy to drive a child to school. He just had someone more important.

We fought fiercely that night.

From the next day on, Emily never asked him to take her to school again.

I had already decided on divorce, but Daniel was still Emily’s father.

After a brief pause, I didn’t refuse.

A faint smile curved his lips as he bent down and lifted Emily.

When I opened the car door, I froze.

The back seat was crammed with things.

An Ultraman water bottle, a wooden bow and arrow, a woman’s shawl. Behind the seat hung a framed “family photo.”

Noticing my gaze, Daniel’s expression shifted. “Madeline just hung it up. She said Leo would be happier seeing it.”

“Don’t get upset over something this small.”

In the past, I would’ve smashed the photo and demanded to know what Emily and I meant to him.

Now I simply nodded. “It turned out pretty nice.”

Daniel stared at me oddly. “You’re not mad?”

Mad? Maybe I should have been. But strangely, my heart was completely calm, even amused.

Such clumsy tactics. A man as sharp as Daniel couldn’t possibly fail to see through them. He just didn’t care.

“Hurry up,” I urged. “Emily’s going to be late.”

His lips pressed thin as he opened the driver’s door. Just as I was about to help Emily into the car, his phone rang.

The ringtone was a childish tune about a good daddy.

On the other end, a little boy sobbed hysterically. “Daddy! Where did you go?”

“Don’t you want Leo and Mommy anymore?”

Daniel hung up without looking at us and jumped into the car.

“Leo’s crying for me,” he said. “Let the driver take you today.”

The black Maybach sped off without hesitation.

I crouched down, worried about Emily, and soothed her softly.

“Daddy had something urgent today. Next time, when he’s free, we’ll go together, okay?”

Emily’s face held a maturity far beyond her years.

“Daddy won’t be free. His time is for Leo Parker and his mom.”

Chapter 2

That evening, Daniel called.

“Claire, I’ll be home late. Leo’s sick.”

“Okay.”

I answered too quickly, and his explanation got stuck in his throat.

He assumed I was sulking, irritation creeping into his voice. “Claire, stop being childish.”

He hung up.

Ten minutes later, several messages came through.

\[Sorry, Claire. Leo’s been really attached to his dad lately.\]

\[But honestly, Daniel shouldn’t have ditched you and Emily the moment I called.\]

\[I’ll scold him. Don’t be mad.\]

The last line even had a giggling emoji.

They were from Madeline.

Those messages weren’t apologies. They were declarations of war.

I had no interest in fighting her over a man, so I deleted and blocked her.

Not long after, Daniel called again.

“Claire, what exactly is your problem? Madeline apologized, and this is your attitude?”

Through the phone, I could faintly hear a woman and a child crying.

I stayed silent.

After a long pause, his low voice sounded. “Claire, how did you become like this?”

“I’m deeply disappointed in you.”

Madeline had clearly provoked me first, yet the moment she cried, Daniel pinned all the blame on me. In his eyes, I was the villain.

When I got home, I started packing.

When Daniel called again, I was consulting my lawyer.

After the divorce, I would receive at least 30% of the Carter Group’s shares.

Given that both parents had similar custody conditions, the child would be awarded to the mother first.

My last hesitation disappeared.

Clothes, bags, jewelry, Emily’s favorite toys. All of it was coming with us.

When I reached the final box, I hesitated. My hands trembled slightly as I broke the dusty wax seal.

Inside was a box full of love letters. From Daniel, written between the ages of seventeen and twenty-two.

I opened the top one.

It began:

\[To twenty-seven-year-old Claire,

This is seventeen-year-old Daniel writing his first love letter to you.

As promised, we’ll open this together ten years from now.

By then, we’ll definitely be married.

Maybe we’ll even have a cute child.\]

My phone rang.

On the other end was twenty-seven-year-old Daniel.

“Claire! Madeline took the kid and ran away. Do you know that?”

“If anything happens to them, I won’t let you get away with it.”

At the same time, my eyes fell on the end of the letter.

\[Forever loving you, Daniel.\]

A sharp pain stabbed my chest, as if something quietly shattered.

I hung up and tossed the entire box into the fireplace.

Chapter 3

Daniel didn’t come home that night.

I didn’t call him nonstop like before, crying and swearing I would never make things difficult for Madeline again.

Emily didn’t ask about her father either.

When I packed our luggage, she quietly took the photo of herself and Daniel with her.

That was how our cold war began.

It lasted until a week later, when Emily’s preschool needed a parental consent form signed with facial recognition.

I called Daniel, only to realize he had blocked me.

With no other choice, I took the form and went to his office.

I hadn’t waited long before I saw a familiar figure walk into Daniel’s office.

The assistant refilling water looked uneasy.

“Mrs. Carter… Mr. Carter said Ms. Wright can enter his office freely.”

Madeline’s privilege was something I had indirectly created.

Back then, I often brought Daniel lunch. We’d eat and talk, sometimes for an entire hour.

Once, Madeline had come looking for him and was stopped by the assistant.

When Daniel walked me out after lunch, Madeline and Leo were outside, lips pale from the cold.

That was the first time Daniel ever lashed out at me. He blew up, saying my daily lunch visits were a waste of his time.

The assistant who stopped Madeline was fired.

From then on, everyone knew Madeline was the person closest to Daniel’s heart.

I never came to the company again.

Smiling at the assistant, I stood up and walked straight toward the office.

Daniel was indeed in a meeting. Seeing me, he looked surprised. “Why are you here?”

Madeline sat on the armrest of his chair, the two of them so close they were almost touching.

Catching my gaze, he hesitated.

“Claire, don’t misunderstand. Madeline happens to know a bit about this project, so…”

I nodded and handed him the tablet.

“Emily has a study trip coming up. She needs a parent’s signature.”

“You came all this way just for that?”

“What else would it be?”

The air around him turned heavy.

I didn’t know why, but based on my years with Daniel, his mood was terrible.

Madeline let out a light scoff.

“What kind of signature needs this much trouble? Daniel, Ms. Thornton just wants to make up with you.”

“You’ve been staying at my place these days anyway. It’s time you went home to see Emily.”

Daniel’s brows relaxed. He tossed the tablet onto the coffee table and smiled faintly.

“Claire, now you’re using our child as an excuse?”

“Apologize to Madeline. Otherwise, I won’t sign.”

In the past, those words would have made me furious.

Angry that he didn’t care about his own daughter, angrier still that he did this for Madeline.

But now, I wasn’t angry at anyone.

I was only thinking that without a signature, Emily couldn’t go on the trip. She would be disappointed.

I looked at Daniel, then at Madeline still perched on his chair. Without another word, I turned and walked out of the office.

Worst case, I’d tell the teacher Emily didn’t have a father.

I hadn’t gone far when a clear, cool male voice spoke up behind me.

“If Ms. Thornton doesn’t mind, I could help instead.”

It was the man who had been in Daniel’s office earlier.

“After all, I’ve witnessed quite a bit of your family situation.”

I studied him then.

He wore a pure black suit, restrained and severe, sharp features and a cold gaze.

He looked unmistakably wealthy.

I handed him the tablet without hesitation.

The verification passed quickly, and his name appeared on the screen.

Julian Grant.

Chapter 4

The divorce agreement was already drafted.

I unilaterally ended the cold war and told Daniel to come home that night.

When I went to pick Emily up from preschool, his Maybach was already waiting in the drop-off zone.

The window rolled down, revealing Madeline’s smug smile in the passenger seat.

“Ms. Thornton, you’re here to pick up your child too?”

“This is St. Aurelian Academy. Why are you still wearing last year’s coat?”

“Aren’t you worried Emily will be laughed at?”

I didn’t bother responding and moved farther away.

Madeline turned to the man in the driver’s seat, looking aggrieved.

“Daniel, did I say something wrong again? Ms. Thornton looks upset.”

For once, Daniel didn’t respond immediately.

He stared at my thin coat, his tone stiff. “Claire, it’s windy out here. Get in the car first.”

I stepped even farther away.

At some point, we had grown unfamiliar. So distant that even a simple concern sounded forced coming from him.

Near the gate, two children suddenly started fighting in line. My heart clenched when I saw one of them was Emily.

I rushed over and pulled them apart, only to realize the other child was Leo.

When he saw me, he froze for a second, then immediately sat down and burst into tears.

“She hit me! It hurts!”

Daniel and Madeline rushed over as well.

Madeline scooped up her son, her face full of anger. “Claire, even if you don’t like me, you can’t take it out on a child.”

“They were just playing around. Was that really necessary?”

Daniel frowned at me, completely forgetting that Emily was his biological daughter.

The teacher looked conflicted.

“Ms. Thornton, Ms. Wright, the two children saw Mr. Carter and both said he was their dad. They argued, and it turned into a fight.”

It was pickup time. Parents surrounded us. Whispers spread instantly.

“What kind of mess is this? Fighting over a dad? Sounds like the wife and the mistress.”

“He looks rich. Maybe the kid’s just lying out of vanity.”

“Wow, so young and already gold-digging. Who knows how she was raised.”

Leo kept crying, arms wrapped around Daniel’s neck, calling him Dad over and over.

Emily, on the other hand, just clutched my hand tightly, staring at Daniel without blinking.

The other children chimed in curiously. “Sir, whose dad are you really? You have to say it.”

“Anyone who goes around calling the wrong man Dad should apologize, you know.”

Daniel opened his mouth. “I’m Emily’s…”

At that moment, Madeline gently tugged at his sleeve, her eyes full of pleading.

In an instant, I understood. Daniel hesitated, just like he always had.

Every time Madeline spoke, Emily and I became his second choice.

I clenched my teeth and reminded him coldly. “Daniel Carter, what you say next will affect Emily for the rest of her life. Think carefully.”

His body stiffened. His eyes lowered, unreadable.

In a voice not loud, but clear enough for everyone to hear, he said, “I’m Leo’s father.”

“Little girl, did you mistake me for someone else?”

My heart lurched as if struck by a heavy hammer. The pain was so sharp I nearly cried.

This was our daughter.

Parents in the crowd began pointing fingers at Emily.

“How can a little girl lie about her father and hit someone else’s son?”

“Yeah, the truth’s out and she still won’t apologize. No manners at all.”

“Jealous of rich kids, wants to be one herself.”

“Look at her mom. She doesn’t look decent either. Probably teaches her kid to call men Daddy to latch onto rich guys.”

“Daniel Carter, are you even human…”

Before I could finish, pain shot through my palm.

Emily bit her lower lip, gripping my hand with shocking strength.

Her eyes dulled in an instant. “Mom, forget it.”

Then she stiffly bowed to Daniel. “I’m sorry, sir. I mistook you for someone else.”",2,1770847384.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1r2b2v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1r2b2v6/a_quaint_60yo_promotional_video_from_lachoy_with/,A quaint 60yo promotional video from LaChoy with demonstrated recipes,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhLLHTsE7Pg

Don't get your bloomers in a bunch over stereotypes, remember this is 1964 and the target audience is traditional housewives raising their baby boomer children on the man's salary.

The agenda is to popularize Chinese-influenced food and show off how easy it is to integrate a ""rare combination of foods that are so readily available for Chinese cookery"" into the American menu, with La Choy brand ready to meet the market demand with its line of canned products. Was this subversion by the ""Red Chinese"" cleverly disguised as marketing? lol ... but TikTok was to debut 52 years later ...

* The video reassuringly stresses the modernity and sanitation of the production process. This was a concern when considering ""foreign"" or ""exotic"" foods.

* The chef character cites the yield at the start of each of his demonstrated recipes. Put yourself in the housewife's position: ""four to six servings"" ... why, the recipe would be perfect for your nuclear family!

* Showcasing La Choy brand ""Chinese"" food thoroughly Americanized so as to be intriguing yet accessible, the recipes are simple and straightforward, eminently doable in any American kitchen. Other than soy sauce and bean sprouts, nothing is particularly ""foreign"" or ""exotic""; the chef even calls his wok a ""Chinese cooking pan"".

* Nice cameo by old-school Pyrex measuring pitcher!

* ""Thirty minutes? My customers are going through the roof right now! In thirty minutes they'll be in orbit!"" The waiter character uses the word ""orbit"", because of course he does. It was '64, we were in the middle of a Cold War and a Space Race; everybody knew the scientific technical term ""orbit"".

* I appreciate the chef explaining that chop suey is not Chinese at all.

* Incidentally I also noticed, because this is /r/Cooking after all, that neither the chef character, nor the ""girl"" character who demonstrates more recipes in the second half, whatever role she plays in the restaurant, doesn't use excessive heat, the bane of so many amateur home cooks, even in his ""Chinese cooking pan"".

* When the waiter character objects the recipes look like they can't be done in a typical American kitchen, the chef holds up one of those ""handy sealed containers"", cans, obviously, but if you look closely it's a special can. It's actually two cans taped together, something La Choy pioneered for its canned Chow Mein product. The meat and sauce were in the smaller can on top and the vegetables in the larger on the bottom. Was this borne of production logistics, or was it a Bernays-style ""add an egg"" ploy to make the American housewife feel she's actually cooking rather than just opening a can?

* Oh look, La Choy even has a recipe and suggestion book! Where can I get one?

* The remaining demonstrated recipes are done in a modern American kitchen. No ""Chinese cooking pans"".

* YMMV but that bacon-wrapped water-chestnut, pineapple, and chicken liver plate would be perfect for Bridge Night. I need to get multi-colored toothpicks.

* The girl character sings the virtues of ""Chinese"" food as low-calorie (yes they had diet fads aplenty even then) and high in protein, but also as a ""meat-stretcher"", not some device that you'd prank the FNG with but something to add meat to to make a fuller meal, like Hamburger Helper was to do in the early 1970s.

* Speaking of dietary fads, keep an eye out for sugar in the recipes. After Ike had his heart attack in '55 there was a massive push to vilify fat and lionize sugar, as Adam Conover would be happy to ruin for you.

* Additionally, mentioning she can get all the provisions she needs for dinner in one place, even one shelf, surely takes the drudgery out of shopping for your family. No need to make separate stops at the butcher and greengrocer (which was a thing in the '60s before the all-in-one ""Super-Market"" became the norm).

* The background music switches from traditional Chinese-style music to flutey jazz for the rest of the video. This is the hardcore-sell part of the video where the girl demonstrates some serious Chinese-influenced recipes that the American housewife can realistically use.

* The ""sumptuous"" Mandarin salad looks positively awful, ngl. And mayonnaise? Always with the mayonnaise. Nice cameo by a yellow Pyrex glass mixing bowl, though. Those go for a pretty penny at mid-century antique malls.

* Check out the Hall Rose Parade pitcher to the left of the coffee station!

* Scrambled eggs ""*Orientale*""? French-Asian fusion egg foo young? What would Jacques Pepin think?

* Idk about boiling chicken for what basically amounts to a chicken stew, but ... Hello Revere Copper Clad saucepan!

* Cute ending, waiter wants to take girl on a dinner date, but with Women's Lib just around the corner she insists on making it herself for them at her place. Chinese pizza? I'm intrigued...

Someone once said that immigrants conquer us with their food.

But my favorites pieces of trivia about La Choy brand specifically are (1) La Choy was started by Ilhan New and Wally Smith, and (2) The three owners of La Choy, all Americans, appeared on *What's My Line* and nobody guessed they made Chinese food!",2,1770847278.0,Cooking,3,1.0,False

We have a landlord who hasn’t ever stuck to legalities of giving appropriate notice for visits. He has showed up unannounced in the past to introduce himself and has called me whilst I’m at work to tell me he’s popping in for maintenance issues in the past. 

The main issue is that our central heating stopped working last week. He promptly popped over to check the situation out, sat down with my boyfriend, had a coffee and a catch up etc. he then arranged for his plumber to come on Monday this week. We said we were happy for him to let the plumber in as we were both at work. Our doorbell camera was left in the hallway as the attachment had broken for it and it’s on a motion sensor. The footage shows the landlord showing up 2.5 hours before the plumber. He let himself in, went to the toilet and we have 2 minutes of footage from the 2.5 hours he was inside the house alone. And in that 2 minutes of footage, he’s seen clearly looking through my handbag, and opening doors to our furniture and having a look through our belongings in the hallway. He had obviously been in other areas, but we don’t have footage of that. 

They have temporarily fixed the boiler and I quote him in saying it was a bodge job and needs further work.  

We texted him the following day a friendly message roughly saying Thanks for addressing the heating issue promptly but we have reviewed our doorbell camera footage and we are no longer comfortable with unsupervised visits to the property and in regards to them coming back today to fix it we would be available between 9-11am and after 2pm. 

He has not responded, it’s been 2 days, and the plumber never showed up today. So we’re left with a dodgy boiler repair and no response from our message setting a boundary. 

The camera was left in an obvious place, and he didn’t clock it until he departed the property 4.5 hours after he entered. 

I don’t really know where do go from here. We feel so uncomfortable with what he has done! ",3,1770847101.0,TenantsInTheUK,3,1.0,False

1r2aze6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aws_cdk/comments/1r2aze6/got_mass_of_cdk_pain_stack_splits_drift_10min/,"Got mass of CDK pain (stack splits, drift, 10-min deploys) and built a framework that deploys Lambda from TypeScript exports in 5 seconds","I've been using CDK for a couple of years and kept hitting the same walls:

* **Stack splitting hell.** Hit the 500-resource limit, now I need to figure out how to split the stack, move resources between stacks without destroying them, deal with cross-stack references, circular dependencies... The actual business logic takes 10 minutes, the stack gymnastics take the rest of the day.
* **Stack drift.** Someone tweaks something in the console, now `cdk diff` shows phantom changes, or worse — deploy fails and you're manually fixing state.
* **10-minute deploys for a one-line change.** CloudFormation synthesizes, uploads, waits, rolls forward. Change a Lambda timeout from 30s to 60s? Go grab coffee.
* **The mental overhead.** You write your handler logic, then you switch to a completely different mental model — Constructs, L1/L2/L3 abstractions, `Grant` chains, asset bundling config. Half my code is infrastructure description, not business logic.

Don't get me wrong — CDK is miles better than raw CloudFormation. But I started wondering: why do I need to describe infrastructure at all if the framework can figure it out from my code?

So I built **Effortless** — an infrastructure-from-code framework. You export handler functions, it derives the AWS resources automatically.

Instead of writing handler code + CDK constructs + IAM grants + waiting for CloudFormation, you just:

    import { defineHttp } from ""effortless-aws"";
    
    export const hello = defineHttp({
      method: ""GET"",
      path: ""/hello"",
      onRequest: async () => ({
        status: 200,
        body: { message: ""Hello!"" }
      })
    });
    

    npx eff deploy  # 5 seconds. done.
    

Lambda + API Gateway + IAM — created. No CloudFormation under the hood — direct AWS SDK calls. No state files — AWS resource tags are the source of truth. No stack limits because there are no stacks.

Current state: open source, MIT, two handler types (`defineHttp`, `defineTable` with typed cross-handler deps and auto IAM). Working on SQS, EventBridge, S3.

Not trying to replace CDK for complex enterprise setups — but for Lambda-based APIs and event-driven services, it removes a lot of accidental complexity.

I’m British with roots from India so I’m well acquainted with a British cuppa’ and masala chai both of which I enjoy from time to time but specialty coffee is my mainstay.

I’ve recently purchased the intro to tea pack by What Cha and it all seems very interesting however even after brewing my cups to the recommended temps using a western method I’m really not finding any enjoyment from these cups. I typically do 3g to 250ml of water and I find the tea possesses some range of astringency that I dislike. The flavours are far more muted (which I expected compared to coffee).

Going to try and finish all these packs (total 35g) but not sure if I am expecting too much or perhaps I just haven’t found a tea I like. So far I have tried the long Jing (which I really did not like) and 2 types of black tea which were okay.

How long should I give it before giving up? I’m guessing it is an acquired taste.

In my life up to this point 10+ years of dating and relationships I've never not received a text back. 6'3 110kg (l work out) Objectively good looking by the caliber of women I've dated and how they always get jealous/comment on how other women look at me but I don't notice. 

I recently started putting myself out there again after a 4 year relationship and for the first time in a long time took the nerve racking plunge to ask a woman for her number I haven't done this for maybe 6-7 (couple of years just using apps prior to last relationship) years and prior to that I literally ALWAYS got a text back. 

She was working a pop up coffee stand so I wasn't sure if it was ""on"" or she was just being nice (Customer facing, I'm not delusional). Even so the eye contact was heavy and she was asking me a lot of personal questions, where I was from what I do for work etc, unprompted from me the conversation was fun, she was giggling and smiling a lot, eventually she mentions how ""those people couldn't survive two weeks in the wild unlike us, we'd survive 2 weeks in the forest"" when talking about the clients I work with. I follow up with a flirty ""you think you could put up with me for two weeks"" it was a quick line but she responded positively we both laughed. Even so I dipped because I was on my way to a client and I did genuinely just want to pick up coffee. 

Fast forward a couple hours I'm on my way back and think I'll get one for the road she's still there I joke about cutting our conversation short and she brings up the comment about us both surviving in the forest. I ask her for her number so we can continue the conversation and try to keep it short and sweet, she mentions that she'd like to visit my area so I can show her around because she's heard its nice I tell her it's a deal and then leave mentioning  skipping the traffic as an excuse (I travel a lot for work). 

To cut a long story short, I text her later that night to confirm the number nothing crazy, ... It was nice to meet you etc... fast forward 48 hours, no response. 

Literally never had this happen in my life. Have things changed in the last 5 years? or once you get a little older because I could swear I've had more success with less interested women in the past. 

Happy to hear all thoughts/provide more context, I just found it bizzarre I really got the vibe she was pursuing, her friend/colleague even looked over her shoulder and jokingly said hey why are you giving him a fake number... I mentioned I wasn't going to message anyway and they got the joke and laughed. 

I might just be off my game only just stepping back in the ring with live approaches, had success with apps but I really want to ""be the change"" and actually have a good story for my next relationship. 

If any of you get this far you're a true hero because that was an essay.

i(20m) have been working in this pizzeria for the last 3 or so years. The reason I'm making this post is because I was always paid the minimum wage. 

I started working there at 16 at minimum wage, which at the time was around 9$ in my country. I started slow and without any confidence but I slowly gained it and became one of the best workers (its a family business so there aren't many workers but I became as good as the owner basically).

I worked there from March 22 throughout the school year and summer vacation on minimum wage as I was a bit embarrassed to ask for a raise.

The next school year started and me and the owner are basically friends now but because I was finishing school at night I couldn't work. That's when I started visiting them after school just to talk and drink a coffee. At the end of the school year my father passed away and my boss obviously came to see me but he also called me one day and told me he is bringing a few pizzas for everybody that came to help with feeding everyone.

After that I started working again but only 1 or 2 shifts a week because off school. I then asked him for a raise and he told me he'd think about the amount and come back with an answer in a few days. He then called me on the weekend and told me that because the minimum wage has raised in the past year and a half (by now) he will give me an 8 cent bonus for each work hour. Because I really like the job and I actually want to open my own pizzeria at some point in my life, I accepted and everything went OK. 

At some point I couldn't work again and when I came back I didnt have that bonus. 

Fast forward to now, im still getting minimum wage and he barely gives me any shifts (I'm actually a student now but I do have quite a lot of time to work at the moment but im still only working w for 3 shifts a week and he doesnt have any other employees other then himself and his son which is a very good friend of me by now).

We moved in together recently, and he brought Ghost, his 120-pound Great Pyrenees. This breed is essentially a sentient cloud that never stops producing massive amounts of white fluff, enough to knit a second, smaller dog every three days. I feel like I'm in a blizzard and have stressed to him upwards of 10 times: this dog simply requires DAILY vacuuming. 

Mark just shrugs and says ""it’s fine"" whenever I point out the literal tumbleweeds rolling across the floor. He refuses to step up the grooming or vacuuming schedule despite my consistent pleas. I’ve tried doing it myself which makes me resentful and now I tried doing nothing which makes our apartment horrible. 

The fur makes me feel tichy and dirty, just sitting ANYWHERE  in our apartment (it’s about 800 square feet). We have air purifies and a powerful handheld vacuum that is great at picking up the hair but it just simply needs to be done EVYER DAY. 

I finally snapped this morning when I sat down on the couch to drink my coffee and immediately felt gross and covered in hair and had to use the lint roller just to be presentable to go to work. 

He came in the room and I yelled that his ""support"" dog was ruining my house because he refuses to pick up the mess. He said it was our dog. And I NEVER SAID THAT. I yelled at him that it is “YOUR DOG.” And this is “YOUR CHORE.” He got defensive and said that i was being “persnickety.” And that’s when I truly lost it. I said that i was going to move out because I am not cleaning up ""the f\*cking fur."" And he is being a ""b\*tch"" and it takes literally 5 to 10 minutes with our nice vacuum. 

He started f\*cking tearing up and I have to be honest, I am not feeling that guilty. I guess what has me confused is that of course, I am happy to feed Ghost and walk ghost and yes, in that sense, it is our dog, but like, I have a line, and it’s his fault for getting a ESA that’s shedding is best measured in sheeps per hour. LIke is this really on me to split??? If we broke up, I would fully expect him to take his ESA, like this isn’t a split custody thing.

He’s now staying at his brother’s house and said I need to calm down. I’m wondering if I really crossed a line her and how to manage this situation. I know I went far but like what do you do when someone repeatedly doesn’t listen and it’s impacting you every day??? AITA?

I start my day at home or a local café right by the beach. There’s something about the hum of a coffee shop that makes deep work feel so much less like a chore.

I’ve started taking my ""lunch break"" in the water. Getting a quick surf session in at noon isn't just a workout, it completely clears the brain fog.

By the time I wrap up my tasks, I’ve worked, exercised, and given my head a rest...all before sunset.

I used to think simple living meant doing less, but I’m realizing it’s actually about doing more of what matters and cutting out the noise. It took a long time to give myself permission to prioritize my environment over a corporate ladder, but I’ve never been happier.

He started in December, I lost my mind the moment I saw him. On our Christmas party he approached me, we talked for 2 hours, invited me to a bar, I declined. After 3 weeks of silence since I was on vacation - we started chatting in our work app. This continued for a week and I tried to get his IG, but he was weird about it so I ended giving him my number. Texted me once about a place I asked and nothing followed. Stopped texing me as a whole. I went on vacation again for a week. Got back, invited him to go out, he said yes - we just walked and talked. Then I approached him again ab work stuff and we chatted for 2 hours. He asked me what I'm doing on the weekend - I was busy. Asked him why? Is he asking our of curiousity or he has something in mind - he said he was just asking. We chatted a bit afterwards on WatsApp. Last monday we talked a bit and I hope I misheard that he has a girlfriend. I've been avoiding him since then. Yesterday he saw me an made a compliment about my outfit. First time he does it. 

 And the latest event. I have a male co-worker that I'm friendly with since we sit next to each other. Today we went together to get coffee from the kitchen, my crush was there having lunch. He saw us walking in together and getting out to the balcony to smoke. An hour later, my crush came to our desks. I was sure he was going to ask me something, then adresses my male coworker and goes ""Hey, you said you like disco, there's an event on Friday, I'll be going with some friends, you should come with us"". To which my coworker said that he can't cuz he's going with other coworkers to a bar ( including me). And said maybe next time. My crush said he'll keep him posted if something else pops up. He didn't even asked me?!?! WTH!! I felt so jelaous xd

So am I overanalyzing this? Is there the possibility that he's trying to get close to my male friend in order to naturally get closer to me? We talked about our sexualities and he very firmly said he's not gay (I didn't asked xd)  Is he trying to play games and piss me off? He's very hot and cold.

For context, I’m a single guy in my early 30s with a career and a house who’s been orthodox for a decade.

I don’t think I’m particularly picky. If the liturgy is in English, or at least not 100% in a foreign language, I’m game to join. My problem has been that nobody is willing to engage with me. I go to coffee hours and young adults gatherings, and can never seem to get beyond basic small talk. I ask questions, try to suggest non-church related hangouts, and am completely stonewalled. The amount of times the conversation drifts to obscure prophecies from St Paisios about WWIII, the Russian government, or some obscure theological concept also hasn’t helped me feel at home.

I attended orthros and liturgy for a year and a half at a parish, and never had someone so much as ask if I’d like to become a member. I think that realization was the final straw to start looking for a new Orthodox parish (I’m blessed to live near about a dozen), but it’s been ROUGH. At the risk of sounding overly critical, I think I’m not ethnic enough for the people who grew up Orthodox and lack the convert zeal needed to fit in with the newer crowd. 

If I don’t find at least some sort of community by Pascha, I’m going to take that as a sign to look at some Catholic parishes. This is mostly me venting, and I hope it doesn’t come across as me bashing any particular parish / group of people. We’re all sinners in search of salvation, and often fall short (myself included). But if somebody had been having this experience in my previous parish, I would have liked to have known so that

I want to lose some weight, around 5-6 kilos which i gained by overeating. I have already had these situations and 1 month was enough to see results - i usually lost around 3 kilos, and then i needed one more month to deal with the rest. But it was during my university time, when I had plenty of basic activity, such as steps while commuting and so on, and combining it with a good diet did magic. Now I've been eating healthier for month, but I'm working as a teacher and most of the time I sit or stand, not walking much. I don't really have time for gym, so the results are not that great. It feels like i have only lost a kilo or whatever, i don't weigh myself because it slightly freaks me out. I rely on the way my clothes fit on me, and my pants used to barely zip on me, now it's better, but could be even much better according to my previous experiences. 

My diet is not strict, i do not eat sugar and if i want to, I substitute it with fruit. It's not difficult for me not to eat sugar, so no judgement please. Also I eat 3 times a day. Normally I have a coffee and plenty of yoghurt for breakfast, light sandwich for lunch, and meat + rice/plain pasta/potatoes for dinner. Also I add some veggies to my dinner ofc. Don't snack, eat by hunger, not by boredom or whatsoever.

I just started getting into coffee recently, and frankly I’m obsessed with the hobby, and want to upgrade my setup, so I’m getting an entry level espresso, and a new grinder for the same.

I bought this from Tata Cliq 4 months ago, around first week of November. It’s the best purchase i made so far, makes pre-ground taste like Horseshit. Highly recommended for anyone starting out.

Details about the product - 

1. 2-3 very minor scratches - mostly paint chipping due to friction around the rotating surface.

2. I have the invoice & original box 

3. Gurugram/Delhi based buyer preferred

4. It’s the metal body variant - so very durable 

5. Negotiable price

**Here’s me, unfiltered:**

* I have a new, but solid career as an engineer.  I pride myself on my work ethic and willingness to learn and grow as a both an individual and a professional. 
* With fun adult money comes fun adult purchases and I am no stranger to buying something that I **ABSOLUTELY** do not need, but we live and we learn, right???? (please say yes lolol)
* As much as I enjoy my job I am not a workaholic, I appreciate the solid work life balance it affords me and I put a good amount of time into my hobbies and spending time with friends and family.
   * I am close with my family, even when they annoy me, and enjoy driving to see them.
* I can clean and organize like a responsible adult, but there is *always* that one chair (or in my case floor....) where clean laundry goes to “rest” before it ever makes it to the closet.
* I **love** music.  I am a frequent concert goer and have a solid vinyl collection (physical media rocks!).  I could not tell you my music taste tho.  It varies from movie soundtracks to thrash metal to bluegrass country.  My motto is, if it sounds good to me then I like it!
* My evenings involve me relaxing through cooking a delicious meal! I pride myself on my cooking skills and love to cook for others.  Nothing brings me more joy than having people eat my food (I feel like a grandma now, constantly feeding my friends when they come over). 
   * Dishes are uhhh... not my strongest suit.  I don't *mind*  doing them but after I just prepped and cooked it is the **last** thing I want to do.  
* I am an active-ish individual.  Could I go out for a run instead of watching a 20 minute YouTube documentary? SURE! Will I? Probably not.  Much of my physical activities come from my hobbies and interests such as skiing / snowboarding, hiking, taking nice strolls, playing intramural volleyball or softball, and kayaking. The dad-bod runs strong with me and i don't see that changing anytime soon (I just like sweets too much...)
* My weekends can vary between every hour being booked up with something to having absolutely zero responsibilities from 5 pm Friday night to 10 pm sunday night. There is no in between. Maybe I should hire a personal assistant to help me plan my time better?
* I am a massive animal lover.  I grew up with dogs and a assortment of other pets.  I currently own two cats who are both my the loves of my life and little stinkers at the same time.  
* I confidently will use the incorrect word or phrase and not even know it.  I was saying ""shaking in your boots"" for the longest time thinking it meant you were so excited you were shaking! Who would've thought it didn't mean that.. HAHA
* I will most likely need you to carry me when I am older.  I am **tall** and my knees are already at old man levels.  Speaking of old man levels, I have been told I am an old man trapped in a young persons body (not sure exactly what they meant).

I know that is a lot of bullet points and it is hard to boil myself down to a few ideas and sentences but I tried!  In short, I'd like to connect with someone who isn't afraid to be themselves, has a curious brain, and prides themselves on their quirks and interests.

Is it crazy to think the person I may be relaxing on a porch with drinking coffee when I'm 60 may be reading this post right now? If that's you, I hope you'll reach out!

With the way the job market is now there’s no chance I’ll be able to find another work from home gig. After a few days of sulking and day drinking I decided that I should start applying for work. My education in computer science and 10 years of experience should place me somewhere rather quickly, but the effort of getting up and going to interviews was almost too much to handle.

“Find anything today hunny?” my wife asked me in her sweet southern drawl. “Not anything worth chasing” I replied, exhausted from doing nothing. “It’ll be ok, I just know you’ll find something better than those assholes at the last place, it wasn’t even your fault”. I turned to her, she planted a kiss on my forehead and she sauntered away, off to cook another meal I feel I didn’t deserve. In truth, it was my fault, a junior engineer changed a few lines of code without testing it and shipped the update, guess who his supervisor is that should have double tested it behind him. Carelessness is a symptom of my growing depression I guess.

Hours of time spent in front of the computer on indeed, Glassdoor, and whatever other kind of sketchy sites desperate people find themselves on, yielded very little in the way of actual progress in my job search. Nevertheless I did submit my resume to at least 100 positions, I am caught in the trap of being very well qualified with great experience and no jobs that are looking to pay me what I deserve, capitalism is a bitch. One job I applied to and then interviewed for, a senior software developer 2 states over, the interviewer asked me why I thought this job would be the correct fit, I gave the proper interview answer bullshit, at the end she said in the most condescending way, “I think your resume is perfect and your experience is great but you just don’t seem like a people’s person, and this position requires good customer service skills”. Maybe she was right, maybe I’ll just keep door dashing and ubering for the rest of my life.

Day 31 of my job search, I woke up, booted my laptop, my wife placed a cup of coffee on my desk, whispered “today is a new day, good luck” and planted a kiss on my cheek then left for work. Alone again. I filtered through my emails, half heartedly looking for an interview request, denial, something. As I scroll I see it

\[Interview Accepted\]-Sight Supervisor- 1:00 pm today

Did I accept an interview for this position? I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs but I don't remember accepting an interview for a “sight supervisor”, did they mean Site supervisor? It doesn’t even have the company name. I’m getting desperate so I click the calendar invite and add it.

Lunch time rolls around, I have my traditional turkey sandwich and a coke. I took a hot shower, shaved and put on a collared shirt, ready for this interview that I somehow accepted and dammit I was going to be prepared. 1 o’clock rolls around and I am let into the Zoom meeting, there is a man, stocky build with a navy polo sitting in the brightest office I have ever seen, and a woman whose camera is off. Brad and Janice. I wasn’t sure if the lighting in the office was due to a bad webcam, or if the sun was 10 feet away from the window, but it was so bright that I had to turn down my laptop brightness and adjust my eyes to the screen.

“Hello Jay”, Brad greeted me in a velvet smooth voice, almost as if you could hear the country club he played at this morning. “It’s nice to have you sit down with us this afternoon, we looked over your application and I must say we are impressed.” “Thank you sir, I replied in my best southern professional tone. “We’re expanding our software lineup here at Holloway industries, and we think that your background could be an excellent fit”. Holloway industries? I've never heard of that company before and certainly don't remember applying to a position there. “Uh, that sounds great!” I nervously replied. “Wonderful, Janice here has some questions, she is the direct superior for this position ill be in touch after your interview” Brad disconnected. “Hi Jay!” came across my speakers in a bright and loud tone. “I am so excited to meet you and potentially have you on our team!” Her demeanor was unlike any other I have encountered in my job search. “Pleased to meet you” I replied, sheepishly. Janice was overbearingly nice, excited and engaged, almost to a fault. Who were these people and why did they seem to want me so badly? The interview went on with the same 6 or 7 questions I have answered at least a dozen times, as I was settling back into my routine, Janice threw me off once again. “How is your eyesight?”. That was odd, I have never been asked that in an interview before, not wanting to fuck this up I replied honestly: “Well I wear contacts, my far sight has slowly been degrading but my near sight is just fine”. “Perfect!” she replied as if she had just found a $100 bill on the floor. She was just too excited, or maybe I was too depressed, either way I needed this job, so I grinned and bared while looking at the blank profile picture. “ last question”  she added “If you were to be offered this position, when could you start?” I replied “Tomorrow”. That answer was music to her ears, I've never heard someone so excited during an interview.

The interview concluded after about 30 minutes of talking to Janice, the most overwhelming person I have met in a long time. “Be on the lookout for an email by the end of the day. We’re so glad to-” she stopped before she said too much too soon. “Have a good evening, Jay” I replied “You do the same”. I closed my laptop with confidence that I could be employed by tomorrow. 6 o'clock rolls around and I am in the kitchen when my wife comes in the door. She looked almost surprised that I wasn't in my office or the bedroom, I had rarely left since losing my job. “How was your day hunny?” I greeted warmly. “It was ok, another day, another 50 cents or so, how about you, what's got you so chipper?” I explained the very odd interview that I had and how I thought I had it in the bag, just that I was waiting on an email with their decision. “That's wonderful hun, I'm so proud of you” a warm kiss landed on my lips. “Im gonna go shower and then perhaps we can celebrate”, said with a devious look on her face. While Kate was in the shower my phone dinged that familiar pattern when an email arrived.

\[Offer Enclosed\]- Sight Supervisor- Holloway industries

“Hot Damn” I thought to myself, opening the email and taking a look at its contents. My starting salary was thirty thousand more than my last job, and my start date is tomorrow. The address for orientation was right in town. How have I never heard of these people, I'm still not sure what they do or even who they are. Who was Brad? What did Janice look like? So many unanswered questions that were sure to be answered tomorrow. No chance in hell I’m not showing up. I cooked a nice spaghetti for Kate and I in which I shared the good news. The look of relief on her face could fill a thousand barrels. “Oh my god, I knew you could do it” she got up from the table and filled my face with her warm kisses. I am surprised the celebration didn't take place right here in the kitchen.

After a night of spaghetti, wine and celebration, I awoke to my alarm clock, its tone I hadn't heard in over a month. I stumbled to the bathroom, showered, brushed my teeth, combed my hair and put on cologne that Kate gifted to me last christmas. All the while she was in bed. Orientation starts at 9, it is 8:15. I made her a cup of coffee and set it on the nightstand, and gave her a warm kiss on the cheek. “Good luck” she whispered, “I know you’ll do great”. She was my rock, my everything in this exact moment. “Thank you, I love you” I replied.

I made it to the office building at about 8:45, it was a nondescript 3 storey building right outside downtown, one that I had passed numerous times without a thought. On the door “Holloway Industries” printed in block lettering. I pushed the handle down and stepped into the atrium.

As the door opened a tone went off and a security panel chimed “front door” in a flat, artificial tone. There was a reception area, with a young lady sitting behind it. She looked toward the door and said with a warm tone “Welcome to Holloway!” “Hello there” I answered back, “Im Jay, I start orientation today for the Sight Supervisor” whatever that means. “Its so nice to meet you, Jay, we’re so glad to have you”. On the desk there was a name plate: Julie. She arose from her seat and came around to greet me. She was much shorter than I am, but she stared directly at my chest, she held out her hand for a handshake, I shook it, she then said “Follow me this way”. How odd, maybe she's autistic and doesn't make eye contact well. Whatever the case may be, I followed her to the elevator. Her fingers grazed the call button, which she pressed and the doors soon opened. “You are going to the third floor, There will be another person to meet you” she added, still not making eye contact. “Thank you” I said kindly, getting into the elevator and pressing 3. There was a clock mounted on the panel. It flashed 12:00:00 repeatedly, as if it had lost power at some point and no one reset it. I double checked my phone and made sure i was on time: 8:52

On arrival to the third floor I stepped into a hallway. The lighting was dim, as if half of the lights were out or turned off. There was another reception desk with an older, slim lady. She called out “Hello there, Welcome to Holloway.” in a monotone bored manner. Finally, someone I can relate to. Her gaze was fixed to the computer, a flickering mess right out of 2009. “Hi there” I greeted, “Im Jay, here for orientation”. Sounding rather annoyed and not looking at me she got up from her seat and said “Follow me”. She took me around what seemed to be a maze of hallways, and some seem too long to be contained in the building we were in. The lights were still half out in some areas but fully bright in others. There were glass offices with no one in them and wooden doors with plates that read “Janitorial” and “Storage”. We finally got into a conference room, the lady I was following instructed me to take a seat and I obliged. “Janice will be right with you” said in a tone so monotone it would put you to sleep. “I didn't catch your name, earlier” but by the time I was able to say it the door was closed.

Being respectful of the work environment I resisted pulling out my phone for what felt like an hour, it was eerily quiet, but the conference room had large windows to see out to the neighborhood behind, I spent some time looking out, waiting for Janice and preparing myself for the onslaught of energy that i will endure in the coming moments. Finally bored enough I pulled out my phone. I had a text from Kate and a couple of emails from jobs I'd applied to. The text read “Have a great first day, I love you, Dinner at Sancho’s tonight?” Sancho’s was my favorite Mexican restaurant, and I knew Kate hated eating there, so she must be really trying to congratulate me on this job. My eyes gazed at the clock: 9:05. That doesn't make any sense, we were walking for at least 5 minutes and I've been in here for at least an hour. Maybe the month of unemployment has messed with my sense of time. I texted Kate back and extended my excitement of dinner tonight, then I heard the click of the door opening.

“Jay! Its so nice to meet you in person!” I knew this excited tone anywhere. Janice is an average height, blonde with huge blue eyes, almost too big for her face. She quickly sat down on a laptop and came around the table, I half expected her to hug me. She reached out for a handshake and I obliged. “Its very nice to be here!” I extended back to her. “Let's get down to business shall we?” she started. A large projector screen extended down on the far side of the room and the projector whirred to life. She started a powerpoint on her laptop, and a blurry image filled the screen. “Shit” I thought to myself “I forgot my contacts”

I was married for about two year to someone I loved. Things were great while we were pushing to build a better life as recovering addicts. But then one day she brought some home and we traveled down that rabbit hole. Then we found out we were pregnant and we both immediately went to rehab.(different ones) she disappeared for about two weeks staying In a hotel. Eventually she went in and we had our son . He was a beautiful healthy boy. So we moved in with her best friend. Now at this point I had been paying for everything for about two years she hadn’t worked I payed all the bills and money for everything else. 6 months in she starts hiding her phone controlling all the money isolating me. Her friend is a female 31 and me and her had coffee every morning when I get home from work we would see each other mostly in passing. Fast forward to about a week ago. I find out my wife had cheated on me in the hotel and that she is intentionally avoiding me before I come home. She even went as far as calling our time together the monthly maintenance nut so I don’t go anywhere. Now let me tell you this all crushed me hard I’d tried so hard to have a healthy family.

There are so many options around here, so I figured I’d share our rankings in case it helps someone else.

We rate each place based on:

• Drive time

• Ease of getting in and out of the drive-thru

• Wait times

• Coffee quality

• Price

• Staff friendliness

• Aesthetics

• Food options

I usually order a plain iced Americano, so that’s what most of our coffee judgments are based on. We also like to grab breakfast, and we’re a family of three (me, my husband, and our toddler), so we’re trying to find something that works for all of us.

Here are our favorites so far, ranked best to worst:

1. Unfortunately, Panera Bread

I signed up for their drink subscription when it was $5 a month, and that’s been hard to beat. I’m not sure it’ll be worth it at $14, but for now it’s winning. Close drive, easy online ordering, quick pickup, coffee is decent. We can get food and drinks for about $22, which is one of the better deals in town.

2. Street Coffee & Bagels

I love their lox, and the aesthetic is adorable. The coffee is solid. Unfortunately, if you get there past 6:30 a.m., the line is out of control. It often seems like only one person is working, and they just can’t keep up. This would be our favorite if the wait wasn’t so long.

3. Bloom

Super cute, really nice staff, good coffee, fair prices. The only downside is that getting in and out is kind of a pain.

4. Starbucks

Prices seem slightly better lately, but for the quality it still doesn’t feel worth it. It’s easy to access, which is nice, but we don’t love the food either. Not much of a reason for us to go anymore.

5. Mercury Coffee Co.

It’s fine, just overpriced for what you get.

6. Whidbey Coffee

We actually loved them, but it’s a little too far and not the easiest in and out. If they opened one closer to Silver Lake, it would probably be our go-to.

7. Buffalo Espresso

Seems to be a local favorite. Easy drive-thru, prices are okay, coffee is decent. Unfortunately, the staff was incredibly rude, and with so many other options around, we’re not eager to give it another try.

8. Woods Coffee

This one hurts because the drive-thru is easy, staff was kind, and prices are good. But the coffee was genuinely undrinkable. I tried to fix it at home with milk, vanilla, and cinnamon and still ended up throwing it away.

We’re still on the hunt, especially since the clock is ticking on Panera’s subscription price. We’d also love to support more local spots instead of bigger chains.

two weeks later, energy is crashing down, workout feels heavy or boring, hunger is up to the roof, belly fat the same, scale is stuck, and mood is getting worse, thinking that you need more discipline or diet is not working, not for me.

you need LESS STRESS. when calories are too low and stress is high, cortisol skyrockets, recovery goes down, training quality worsens, NEAT decreases, and worst of all hormones adapt.

you dont feel leaner, you feel wired and tired.

fat loss works best when protein is high, calories are moderate, sleep is protected, strength training is peogressive, and stress is managed.

aggressive deficits/ crash diets works for a a short window, sustainable plans works long term.

most people don't fail fat loss beause they!re lazy, they fail because they try to force their body instead of working with it.

1r29u90,https://generatop.com/names/youtube-channel-name-generator,YouTube Channel Name Generator: Your Personal Namer for the Perfect Name Millions Will Remember,"# [YouTube Channel Name Generator](https://generatop.com/names/youtube-channel-name-generator)



# The moment you first start thinking about launching your own YouTube channel, nailing down the vision for your project often matters more than buying a camera or editing your very first video. It might sound surprising, but it's true. Your channel name is the front door—the very first thing viewers see, remember, and use to find you in search results. Let's be honest: it's hard to picture a hugely successful channel with a bland, forgettable name that blends into the crowd of thousands.

That's why a **YouTube channel name generator** has become way more than a fun gimmick—it's a legit professional tool for bloggers, musicians, gamers, and anyone stepping onto the digital stage.

Back in the day, entire teams of naming experts handled branding for every industry, including YouTube channels. They'd charge thousands of dollars (or tens of thousands of rubles) for a single solid suggestion—and that was considered standard. Times have changed. Now smart algorithms do the heavy lifting, taking into account every nuance to help you land on the perfect name. Our **YouTube name generator** keeps it brilliantly simple: just type in keywords, associations, or even personal details from your life, and it spits out dozens of fresh ideas. And yes—it's 100% free.

# Why a creative channel name outperforms the obvious ones

Ever wonder why some channels explode in recommendations while others—with great content—stay stuck for years? The numbers don't lie: channels with creative, standout names tend to attract roughly 30% more viewers right from the start compared to those using plain, keyword-stuffed titles. Thirty percent! That's a massive head start you get before you even say a word on camera.

It comes down to psychology. When someone sees a name like “Ivan's Game Reviews,” their brain instantly tags it as “just another generic channel.” It's clear, but it triggers zero emotion or curiosity. Now compare that to names like “Fragments of Eternity,” “Midnight Gamer,” or “Forge of Legends.” Feel the difference? The second group instantly paints a picture, sets a vibe, and makes a promise. The viewer hasn't even clicked yet, but they're already hooked. That's the real magic of unique YouTube channel names.

And this principle holds true across any niche. A cooking channel called “Tasty Recipes” gets crushed by “Pan Thief” or “Devil's Kitchen.” Travel: “My Trips” loses to “Backpack Till the Grave” or “Map of Sins.” Beauty: “Daily Makeup” can't compete with “Brush & Glow.” The gap is obvious.

But how do you find that one killer, memorable name out of thousands of possibilities? That's exactly where a good **YouTube name generator** shines—it crunches combinations in seconds that would take a human hours of painful brainstorming.

# Key features of a smart generator: from niche fit to SEO

Let's be real: most online name generators just mash two random words together and call it a day. Our approach is completely different. We built a multi-layered algorithm that weighs several critical factors—because a great YouTube channel name isn't just about pretty letters.

1. **Niche & vibe analysis** The generator studies your content style. A let's-player needs high-energy, adrenaline-fueled vibes. A cyber sports analyst needs authority, depth, and precision. The algorithm knows the difference and won't suggest “Serious Finance” to a gaming channel.
2. **Built-in SEO optimization** Yes—your channel name is a search query. People search both broad terms and specific channel names they've heard from friends or seen in recommendations. A strong name strikes the perfect balance: it includes a recognizable marker for your niche while staying unique and brandable so it's not invisible to search engines.
3. **Multilingual safety check** Even if your content is 100% in English (or Russian), YouTube is global. Your name might reach viewers worldwide. It needs to be easy to read and pronounce, without accidental offensive or awkward meanings in major languages. A good generator flags those issues automatically, saving you future headaches.

# Gaming channel name generator: its own universe

Gaming deserves special mention—**gaming channel name generators** are by far the most popular category. The video game world is massive, competition is insane, and standing out is brutal. But gamers have one huge edge: their audience is the most loyal and the most vibe-sensitive.

What name pulls viewers into a CS:GO or Valorant stream? It needs to feel like a battle cry: “Tactical Fog,” “Last Clutch,” “Frag Parade.” Short, punchy, aggressive. For deep-story single-player RPG let's-plays, you want epic immersion: “Chronicles of the Wanderer,” “Adventurer's Journal,” “Pages of Forgotten Worlds.”

For editing breakdowns, esports analysis, or game design content, lean more serious and almost academic. Many generators let you pick a mood—edgy, mysterious, epic, techy—and serve up names that nail the tone perfectly.

Bonus: the same tool works great for clan or team names. Finding a cool, available name for your squad is notoriously hard. A solid generator solves it instantly.

# Where do the best YouTube channel name ideas come from?

A lot of people think killer names are born from late-night coffee-fueled torture sessions. In reality, professional naming techniques—proven for decades—power modern generators. Here's a peek behind the curtain:

* **Metaphor** — Take your topic and compare it to something unexpected. Cooking becomes “Kitchen Alchemy.” Travel becomes “Sneakers Geography.” Tech reviews become “Digital Forge.” Metaphors build instant imagery that's sticky.
* **Oxymoron** — Combine opposites. “Sober Gamer,” “Botanical Rap,” “Fluffy Hacker.” It sparks a smile and curiosity—especially in fun niches.
* **Wordplay / puns** — Twist idioms, hints, double meanings. “Good Enough” for life hacks & DIY. “Guilty Without Guilt” for legal or psych content. Use sparingly—overcomplicated puns confuse casual viewers.
* **Personal story** — The best names sometimes come from your own life: childhood nickname, funny slip-up, standout last name. That's why the best generators let you input personal associations—they turn them into one-of-a-kind suggestions no one can copy.

# How to test if a name is battle-ready

Say the generator gives you 50 options and 10 feel perfect. What next?

1. **Say it out loud** — Repeat it 10 times. Easy to pronounce? No awkward consonant clusters? No weird unintended associations?
2. **Spelling & searchability** — Does it look clean in a search bar? Easy to type after hearing it once?
3. **Visual fit** — Picture it on thumbnails, merch, banners. Does it make a strong logo?
4. **Uniqueness check** — Quick YouTube search: exact match = bad. Similar in your niche = risky. Ideal = truly one-of-a-kind.
5. **Future-proofing** — Will it still work in 1, 3, 5 years? Avoid locking yourself into a super-narrow topic you'll outgrow. “Mouse Reviews” limits you. “Digital Ergonomics” scales.

# Free YouTube name generator: busting the “paid is better” myth

There's a stubborn belief that quality always costs money. Plenty of people still think the only way to get a good channel name is to hire an expert or buy expensive software. That's outdated.

Sure, paid branding tools exist—but their algorithms are rarely superior. They use the same databases + combinatorics. A truly good free generator delivers the exact same power without charging you. Why pay when creativity shouldn't be gated by budget? Especially for new creators pouring every dollar into gear and production.

No limits, no paywalls—generate hundreds or thousands of ideas until one gives you chills. It's especially valuable for beginners.

# Beyond YouTube: use it for blogs, music, teams

While built for YouTube, the generator works perfectly for naming blogs on TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, Telegram, or anywhere else. Algorithms don't care about the platform.

Musicians use it for band or project names. Finding a fresh, available name for a rock group or EDM duo is just as hard as snagging a good username. It breaks old patterns and delivers unexpected combos.

Esports teams and gaming squads love it for clan names—something proud, team-spirited, and not overused.

# Step-by-step guide: how to get the most out of a name generator

1. **Prep** — Before opening the tool, jot down 10–20 words: niche, mood, audience, unique angle. More input = better output.
2. **Generate** — Enter words in batches. Mix and match. Hit generate dozens of times. Save anything that even slightly resonates.
3. **Let it sit** — Close the tab for 2–3 hours. Come back with fresh eyes—you'll spot winners differently.
4. **Test live** — Show 3–5 finalists to friends or potential viewers. Don't ask “which is best?” Ask: “What comes to mind hearing this? What kind of content do you expect? What feeling does it give?”
5. **Availability check** — YouTube, all socials, domain (.com/.io/etc.), even trademark if you're serious.
6. **Decide** — No name is perfect. Pick one that's good enough—and then make it legendary with your content, personality, and work.

# Final thought: your name is your foundation

It all circles back to the beginning: building a YouTube channel doesn't start with gear. It starts with a name—the word or phrase that becomes your digital home for years. It's the base you build your audience, style, and recognition on.

Don't let the hunt for “perfect” freeze you. Don't copy others or settle for the first thing. Experiment with modern tools. Mix unexpected ideas. A solid **YouTube channel name generator** will be your trusty sidekick on this ride.

Millions of creators—bloggers, gamers, musicians—have already done it. Thousands of thriving channels were born from a few clicks and a spark of inspiration. Now it's your turn. Plug in your keywords, hit generate, and find the name the world will know you by. It's free, fast, and honestly kind of addictive. Everything else—content, editing, growth—will follow. Because when your foundation is strong, building on it feels effortless.",1,1770844450.0,generatop,0,1.0,False
1r29u1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesbyChris/comments/1r29u1p/i_attended_a_survivor_support_group/,I Attended A Survivor Support Group,"I look around at the gathering of strangers in the drab, depressing room. Some were dressed well, some shabbily; some stared around, some looked down at the floor. All looked like they’d rather be anywhere else.

A man in jeans and a button-up shirt spoke up. “Would anyone like to speak?”

I looked around; everyone stayed silent.

What the hell.

“I’ll go.”

“Wonderful. Do you know how this works?”

“I think so.”

“Take it away.”

I took a breath.

“My name is Melody and I’m a survivor.”

“Hi, Melody.”

“Three years ago, I had just gotten home from work when a cloth was placed over my mouth as I stood outside my apartment entrance. The next thing I knew, I was in a dark basement. I spent the next two years there.”

Everyone around was nodding like they understood. I suppose they did.

“I remember waking up every day terrified. Not knowing if it would be my last day, if that was the day he’d kill me. Sometimes I wish he had.”

I went on, describing my experience - the beatings, the starvation, the abuse. The nights he’d pipe in loud music or bang on the walls so I couldn’t sleep, the days he’d force me to listen to my parents begging for my return on television, the days he’d make me think I was about to die and then laugh while I trembled in shock and fear. He terrorized me. And worse.

Eventually I finished my tale. “Thank you for letting me share.”

After my story, everyone got up and milled around.

“That was intense. How are you doing?”

I looked up - a woman stood beside me, drinking her coffee and eating a donut.

“Sandra always brings these - ‘nothing like sugar to sweeten the mood,’ she always says. Personally, I think it’s stupid, but who doesn’t like a good donut?”

“Hi,” I said. “I’m Melody.”

“I heard,” she said, smirking.

“Right. Stupid. Sorry - I’m kind of nervous. This is my first time here.”

“We all had our first time. I’m Gwen.”

“Do you come to this group often?”

“Every week for five years. Since just after I was freed.”

“Freed?”

“Yes, my captor kept me for over a year. Then, one day, out of the blue, I woke up and the door was open. I walked out, but the house was empty. I never saw him again. It took me years to put myself back together.”

“How did you get over it?” I asked.

“I’ll let you know when I do.”

As I watched her turn and walk away, I remembered the end of my own captivity. I too had awoken one day to an open door, after I’d been with him for over a year. I went to the hospital and they called the police. I was free.

But I wasn’t. Not really. Everything had changed. And, as much as I wanted to go back to how things had been before, I couldn’t.

So I looked for him. And one night, after searching for months, I found him. He was leaving a bar, and I followed him.

And he saw me.

“What do you want?” he asked, holding a knife to my throat.

“To come with you!” I exclaimed, releasing the secret id kept since I was freed.

There was a pause.

“No.”

I returned to the present, where Gwen had fallen to the floor, her mouth still foaming though her breathing had stopped and her eyes had frozen in a death stare. I looked around the room - everyone there was in a similar death pose. They should have avoided the donuts.

It was done. All of his other victims were dead.

You hear the words, but your mind interprets them as something more familiar.

Even now I catch myself wondering — did I really hear it correctly? You were speaking so quietly, almost in a whisper…

When I look into your eyes, I sometimes notice a certain irritation. Other times, I see a kind of hidden warmth. And sometimes there’s so much confidence in your gaze that it almost feels a little intimidating.

But I know for sure — and I believe you see it too — that this is not indifference. It matters to me.

Sometimes it feels like our interaction exists inside a kind of bubble. And maybe, in reality, everything is much simpler than it seems.

I just feel that we probably shouldn’t leave things like this. Maybe it would be better to clear it up somehow.

1r29q6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1r29q6e/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_the_kitchen_if_dishes/,AITA for refusing to clean the kitchen if dishes aren’t rinsed?,"I’ve asked multiple times for dishes to be rinsed right away. They don’t need to be washed, they don’t need to be put in the dishwasher. All I ask is that dishes get rinsed right away, so stuff doesn’t dry and harden and become a pain to rinse later.

My husband has consistently refused to do this.

When dishes aren’t rinsed, it turns what should be a five-second rinse into twenty or thirty minutes of me leaning over the sink scrubbing things.

A couple of important points:

\- I am disabled and deal with chronic pain. I have limited movement I can do in a day. Leaning over the sink for extended time is outright *painful*, and leaves me unable to do anything else for the rest of the day.

\- We are only two people living in the house, so we do not run the dishwasher everyday. This means dishes will sit for two or three days before going into the dishwasher - so food has time to really cement on there if it’s not rinsed. So for people who claim you don’t need to rinse your dishes before they go into the dishwasher, that may be true *if you run your dishwasher daily.* But that’s not our case.

Yesterday, I tried to clean the kitchen since my husband wasn’t home. When I unloaded the dishwasher, there were multiple dishes that were still dirty because they didn’t get rinsed before going in (ex: out of six bowls, four still had visible food caked on the inside). So I had to set those aside to be scraped/scrubbed before running them through the dishwasher again.

Then I went to reload the dishwasher, but half of the dishes (my husband’s half) had food dried on that I had to scrub to get off. He had made eggs the day before and the spatula, pan, and bowl all had dried egg caked on them. His coffee cups had solidified rings from the creamer he didn’t rinse. All in all, it was a disgusting and tiring experience to finally just get the *dishwasher* taken care of, not to touch on the rest of the kitchen.

By the end of it, I was in pain, I was exhausted, and when my husband got home I told him I’m not cleaning the kitchen anymore if he can’t even rinse his dishes. He still insists he shouldn’t have to rinse his dishes, that the dishwasher should get them clean (it doesn’t - I’ve shown him that the dishes were dirty even after he ran them through the heavy duty/pots and pans setting). He also says if it bothers me, then *I* can be the one to rinse everything.

Today after drinking coffee I vomited, partially due to me considering that maybe if I did this the gaggy feeling would go away. Vomit was brown.

Assumed this color was due to just consuming coffee, but looking it up I've read that brown vomit can indicate internal bleeding which is spooky. Looked like normal vomit to me otherwise though, or at least how I remember it looking. 

Should I be scared or is it likely just due to consuming brown liquid? I've been planning to chill, finish an exam tomorrow, and then talk to people if I still seem fucked up or vomit again. I really don't want to have to reschedule that exam.",1,1770844188.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Understand what this means. It means that you are beyond time, above matter. There is nothing you cannot have. What you say is IT. It is not optional, it is inevitable. There is no other way but your way.

Also know that it’s not your visualizations, techniques, feelings, emotions, thoughts, or words that manifest. The part of you that's been manifesting your whole life is beyond your body. Anything that your body has is not required to manifest. The body only enjoys (or experiences) the manifestations. So you can just stop being afraid of your thoughts and emotions now.

*“But what if I don’t believe I am God…”* \- It doesn’t matter. This is how it is. Whatever you say is real, is real! Whatever you say is true is true. You cannot escape this. And there is no bigger self concept than God. So just accept it. This makes everything so much easier.

The funniest thing is- you can say ""I am not God"" and it will be true for you BECAUSE YOU ARE GOD. It wild how people say powerless things while standing in full power.

Which brings us to the second thing.

**2. DECISION.**

**Manifestations are made of your decisions.**

Seriously, just make one. Decide who you are, what you have, what your life looks like, who loves you—all of it. Decide what story you are going to tell about yourself to yourself.

That’s it. This is all about you.

*“If all I need to do is decide then how come things I don’t want manifest”* \- Because you decided what you didn’t want was true. 

At any given time you’re simply deciding. Do I like this person? (Insert decision). Is this job mine? (Insert decision). Is my SP cheating on me (Insert decision). Usually you make these decisions based on your past experiences or logic.

When you were unawakened to this knowledge you simply agreed to things you thought were most logical. A thought occurred and you decided yes or no, even if the decision hurt you. You were oblivious to your power. On top of this you gave meaning to things, again with the limited logic. “This person hates me because I am dumb” (There are two decisions made in this sentence)

Nothing has anything to do with anything else. Food does not make you fat. Money is not evil. Economy is not bad. You don't always get sick. People are not out to get you. Nobody is victimizing you. No, your SP does not NOT want you because of the way you look!

All of this could only be true because you decided that it was, or at least you agreed to it. Now you don't have to. Now that you know you're god you can literally decide anything. If I were you I would glide through life deciding everything I want is mine.

Most people say their affirmations not as decisions but as requests of hope that someday they will have their desires if they keep saying it. They say affirmations as means to an end and not the end itself.

You’ve got to say it like that’s what you have decided already and you won't change your mind. No matter what you see, you stick to your decision. Do not decide against yourself no matter what.

**Try this trick of mine if you have trouble ""believing"" your affirmations.**

Instead of ""My SP loves me"" say - “I have decided that my SP is head over heels in love with me.”

Similarly:

“I have decided that I got the job.”

“I have already decided that my body is size (whatever you want).”

""I have decided I am the lottery winner.""

“I have decided I am rich!”

“I said what I said.”

“I decided…. End of story. No ifs ands or buts about it.”

""I have decided that this is who I am from now on.""

Whether you feel sad, happy, hungry or frustrated- your decision cannot change.

Say, you’ve decided that your SP loves you but you see them with a 3P. It’s natural that you will have rough emotions about it. Understandably thoughts will flow, such as “my SP doesn’t love me” - this is when you double down, never back off!

“Actually! I decided that my SP loves me. I don't care what this shit is. It is not what I decided. Period.”

And you keep it moving. Dig your heels down. And remember you’re not doing this to SEE proof. Proof will come anyway! You are simply deciding right now. Do not get caught in the cycle of reacting to circumstances and questioning your decisions.

**3. Repetition.**

""If decision is enough then why do I need repetition."" You don’t. For stuff that you have no problem deciding and sticking to for eg: free coffee, discounts, first dates, small amounts of money etc. No problem, no repetition needed.

It is for those times when you unknowingly go against your decision. When you’re starting to stress about bills, or deadlines, or health emergency. Something that feels big. Repeat repeat repeat your decision.

“I got it.” 

“I have it.”

“I am going to have it.”

“It is mine.”

“I have already decided it is this way. That’s it.”

**A little pro tip:**

Fuck all the rules. Fuck everything you’ve ever learned about manifesting. Stop watching manifestation videos. Stop trying to do techniques when they exhaust you. You have always manifested your life, you never needed any technique before. You don’t need them now. You don’t have to feel safe in your desires because you and I both know that you have manifested things in your life that didn’t feel safe. So let go of all limitations.

Pay attention to yourself. The moment you come home after a long day and there’s no one around, the first thing you bring up to yourself is your inner conversation. It's really mellow and quiet. It is very familiar. It may not even be in words, thoughts or visuals. Its just there and you know it, you've been experiencing it your whole life. That’s the thing you have to change.

Pay attention to that story you’ve been telling. Chances are while you’re lost in chasing technique after technique nothing has stuck because you never truly changed that core story. And once you change that, trust me, you will never have to fight your thoughts, feelings or emotions again.

**Just sit down with yourself one day, decide how your life is going to be from this day forward and stick with it.**

Do not dawdle. Do not question your own decision. At least not based on some stupid circumstance. Do not question if it’s possible. Do not give meaning to emotions. Do not wonder if you're doing things right. Do not ask yourself “what SHOULD I think if I want this desire?” - ask - “WHAT DO I WANT?” And once you know, decide that’s how it’s going to be. Stick to it without looking for proof. You never looked for proof before you don’t need to now either.

Use techniques to feel your desires but don't rely on them to give you proof. Techniques are for your body to enjoy your desires, they do not manifest. Unless they aid you in your decision. Same thing is true about thoughts and feelings etc.

You don’t have to believe, or have faith, or will anything to be real. 

You decide it. It is real.

Your word is your world. 

Stop waiting. Start deciding.

Every time your desire comes to mind—repeat your decision.

1r29lv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueLearnLLC/comments/1r29lv2/how_to_use_flashcards_to_prepare_for_medical/,How to Use Flashcards to Prepare for Medical Boards,"Flashcards have been around forever… because they work *when you use them the right way*. The big win isn’t “having cards,” it’s using flashcards to force **active recall** and build **spaced repetition** into your schedule (the two ingredients that actually move long‑term retention for boards).

Below is a practical, non‑overwhelming way to build and use flashcards for board prep — especially if you’re balancing rotations, questions, and real life.

# Why Flashcards Make a Difference for Board Prep

Flashcards shine when you:

* **Pull information out of your brain** (active recall), instead of re‑reading it (passive recognition).
* **Review over time** (spaced repetition), so your brain keeps re‑strengthening the memory when it’s about to fade.

One more thing: yes, it’s tempting to download someone else’s deck. But making your *own* cards can be part of what makes the info stick (even though it takes time).



# How to Make Better Flashcards (4 rules that prevent “card bloat”)

**1) Go digital**

Digital cards are easier to carry, easier to organize, and easier to review in tiny pockets of time (elevator/stairs/coffee line).

**2) Be thorough (without writing a textbook)**

Instead of a one‑word back side, add:

* a quick “why”
* a clinical example (“what this looks like in real life”)
* a reference pointer (textbook page / note section) for when you need to go deeper

**3) Use visuals when they help**

If a diagram, chart, or image makes a concept click — add it. People tend to remember visuals better than words (picture‑superiority effect).

**4) Don’t overcrowd the card**

If the back side looks like a mini lecture… it’s probably too much. Keep each card focused on what you *actually need to recall*, and split topics into smaller cards when needed.

# A Simple System for Studying with Flashcards

**Use the “3 piles” approach**

Make three categories:

1. **Instantly know it**
2. **Know it, but hesitate**
3. **Don’t know it (or miss it)**

Hit pile #3 the most often, but still rotate through all piles so you don’t forget “easy” material.

Also: shuffle your decks/piles regularly so you’re recalling, not memorizing the order.

**Read it out loud (yes, really)**

Try this:

* Read the front
* Explain it aloud (before flipping)
* Then recite the back

This taps into the **production effect** — people often remember things better when they *say them out loud* vs read silently.



# Space your Review (don’t cram)

Cramming can create short‑term familiarity, but spaced repetition is what builds durable recall. Make a schedule you can actually stick to (even if it’s small daily reviews).



# How to do This Inside TrueLearn (if you’re already using the SmartBanks)

If you’re studying in TrueLearn and want your flashcards connected to your practice questions, you can build cards right in the platform:

* Create cards from the **Flashcards** section, *or* create them as you’re doing questions
* Organize cards into **decks** (by topic/system/exam)
* Use study mode for classic flipping *or* spaced repetition sessions

Bonus: **SmartAlerts** can send key learning points from missed questions — which pairs really well with a “missed concepts” flashcard deck.

1r29ijq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1r29ijq/how_to_be_rizzy_the_psychology_of_magnetism_that/,How to Be Rizzy: The Psychology of Magnetism That Actually Works,"We've all seen those people who just have it. They walk into a room, and suddenly everyone's paying attention. They crack a joke,e and people are hanging on every word. They're not necessarily the hottest person there, but somehow they're magnetic as hell. That's rizz. And if you think you're just born with it, or you're screwed, you're dead wrong.

I spent months diving deep into this, reading everything from psychology research to pickup artist bullshit (so you don't have to), watching endless hours of charisma breakdowns, and honestly just observing people who naturally pull this off. Here's what actually works, backed by real research and not some recycled ""just be confident bro"" garbage.

Step 1: Fix Your Foundation (The Stuff Nobody Wants to Hear)

Before we get into the sexy tactics, let's talk basics. You can't rizz anyone up if your foundation is cracked. This isn't about being a 10/10 model. It's about basic self-respect that people can feel.

Hygiene and grooming: Yeah, I know, boring. But science backs this up. Studies show people make snap judgments about attractiveness in literal milliseconds, and hygiene plays a massive role. Get a decent haircut that fits your face shape (ask your barber for real advice). Smell good, but don't drown yourself in cologne. Clean nails. Moisturize. The bar is literally on the floor here, but most people still trip over it.

Dress like you give a damn: Not expensive clothes. Clothes that fit and show you have some personality. Experiment. Find what makes you feel like a beast. That confidence translates.

Step 2: Master the Art of Presence (Stop Being Invisible)

Here's where it gets real. Rizz isn't about what you say. It's about the energy you bring before you even open your mouth. Dr Amy Cuddy's research on body language showed that how you carry yourself literally changes your hormone levels and how others perceive you.

Body language fundamentals:
- Stand/sit up straight but not stiff (like you're comfortable in your own skin)
- Take up space naturally (don't shrink yourself)
- Maintain eye contact without staring like a psycho (hold it for 3-4 seconds, look away naturally, come back)
- Slow down your movements (rushed = anxious, slow = confident)

The trick? Move as you belong everywhere. Not arrogant, just... unbothered. Watch how Barack Obama or Denzel Washington moves. They're never in a rush. They're never seeking approval. That's magnetic.

Step 3: Learn to Actually Listen (The Superpower Nobody Uses)

Everyone thinks Rizz is about being the most interesting person in the room. Wrong. It's about making other people feel interesting. Psychologist Arthur Aron's famous ""36 Questions"" study showed that deep listening and genuine curiosity create instant connection.

Active listening tactics:
- Ask follow-up questions that show you were actually paying attention
- Mirror their energy (if they're excited, match it; if they're chill, be chill)
- Remember small details they mentioned and bring them up later (this is HUGE)
- Put your damn phone away completely

People are starving for genuine attention. When you give it, you become addicted.

Step 4: Develop Your Conversational Edge

Alright, now we're getting spicy. Good conversation is like jazz. You need structure, but also the ability to riff. Communications expert Celeste Headlee breaks this down brilliantly in her work on conversation.

Conversation framework:
- Start with playful observations, not boring questions (""You look like someone who has strong opinions about pizza toppings"" beats ""So what do you do?"")
- Use callback humour (reference something from earlier in the conversation)
- Tell stories with emotion, not just facts (people remember how you made them feel)
- Don't be afraid of light teasing (but read the room, you're being playful, not mean)
- Leave some mystery (don't explain everything about yourself immediately)

Book rec: The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane. This woman coached everyone from Fortune 500 CEOs to introverts who wanted to level up. The book breaks down charisma into learnable behaviours backed by neuroscience. One game changer? The concept of ""presence"" is where you train yourself to be genuinely focused on the moment. When you're fully present with someone, they feel it. Makes conversations 10x more electric.

If you want to go deeper into social psychology and communication but don't have the time or energy to read through dense academic papers and dozens of books, there's BeFreed. It's an AI-powered personalised learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that pulls from psychology research, dating experts, and communication books to create custom audio lessons just for your goals. 

You can type something like ""how to be more magnetic as an introvert in dating situations"", and it'll generate a personalised learning plan with podcasts tailored to your exact struggle. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus, you get a virtual coach called BeFreed that you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. The voice options are wild; you can pick anything from a smoky Samantha-from-Her style voice to something more energetic. Makes learning this stuff way more addictive than doomscrolling.

Step 5: Master the Push-Pull Dynamic

This is where most people screw up. They're either too available (boring) or too aloof (asshole). The sweet spot is push-pull. Give attention, then pull back slightly. Show interest, then focus on something else. This creates tension, and tension creates attraction.

How it looks:
- Compliment them genuinely, then playfully challenge them on something
- Engage fully in conversation, then get slightly distracted by something interesting
- Show you're interested but not desperate for their approval

This isn't manipulation. It's showing you have a full life beyond any one person. And that's attractive as hell.

Step 6: Build Genuine Confidence (Not Fake It)

Real talk: Fake confidence is transparent. People can smell it. Real confidence comes from competence and self-acceptance. You need to actually be someone interesting.

How to build it:
- Get good at something (hobby, skill, anything you can geek out about)
- Do hard things regularly (gym, cold showers, public speaking, whatever scares you)
- Use the app Finch for building daily habits that stack into genuine self-improvement (it's a cute bird that motivates you but actually works)
- Stop comparing yourself to others on social media (use apps like Opal to limit your screen time)

The more competent you become, the less you need external validation. And ironically, that's when people want to give it to you most.

Step 7: Embrace Rejection Like a Badge of Honour

Here's the secret nobody tells you: People with insane rizz get rejected ALL THE TIME. They just don't let it wreck them. Behavioural psychologist Dr Robert Cialdini's research shows that confidence in the face of rejection is one of the most attractive traits.

Reframe rejection: It's not ""they rejected me."" It's ""we weren't compatible."" Not everyone will vibe with you, and that's perfectly fine. The faster you can shake off a ""no"" and move on, the more attempts you get, and the better you become.

Practical exercise: Set a goal to get rejected once a week. Ask for something unreasonable. Strike up conversations with strangers. The more you normalise hearing ""no,"" the less power it has over you.

Step 8: Use Humour as Your Secret Weapon

Funny people are unforgettable. But here's the thing, you don't need to be a comedian. You just need to not take yourself too seriously. Research from the University of Kansas found that shared laughter is one of the strongest predictors of attraction.

Comedy fundamentals:
- Self-deprecating humour (but not self-pitying)
- Observational humour about your surroundings
- Playful absurdity (say something ridiculous with a straight face)
- Timing matters more than the actual joke

Watch comedians like Andrew Schulz or podcasts like Flagrant 2 to see howtop-tierr conversationalists riff. They're comfortable with silence, they don't overexplain, and they commit to the bit.

Step 9: Create Experiences, Not Just Conversations

Rizz isn't just verbal. It's about creating moments people remember. Instead of ""let's grab coffee,"" suggest something unexpected. A weird museum. A late-night taco spot. Anything that breaks the pattern.

Shared novel experiences create stronger bonds than repetitive ones, according to relationship research. Be the person who makes life more interesting.

TL;DR

- Fix your basics (hygiene, style, posture)
- Presence beats words every time
- Listen like their story is the most interesting thing ever
- Learn to have conversations with edge and playfulness
- Master push-pull (interested but not desperate)
- Build real confidence through competence
- Rejection is data, not devastation
- Be funny without trying too hard
- Create experiences, not just small talk",1,1770843728.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

Top shade is Truth Be Untold. 3rd shade is Warm Teddy. Random shades below that.  I am wearing Crème In Your Coffee on my lips in picture 2. )

As a warm olive (and a ""soft autumn color season"") I love MAC Warm Teddy, but it is too matte on my ""Kibbe soft natural"" face which requires some fresh looking moisture on the lips.

In the white lights of Ulta, the shade appeared so slightly purplish, but two employees stopped me to genuinely say this is MY shade! When I stood facing the natural sunlight, this shade clicked. This ""sleek satin"" formula is much more moisturizing than the ""matte"" shades. I hope this helps another muted warm olive :)",7,1770843505.0,OliveMUA,2,0.89,False

1r29b8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1r29b8h/how_i_reprogrammed_my_identity_from_broke/,"how i reprogrammed my identity: from broke & scattered to 6 figs, travel & dream life","Everyone talks about grinding, goalsetting, waking up at 5 am. But no one talks about the real gamechanger: identity. The version of you that does the thing is not just more productive it's a different person. Most friends I know hit a ceiling not because they're lazy, but because deep down, they’re still operating from an identity that doesn’t match the life they want.  
  
This post is about how changing your selfidentity not just habits can unlock real transformation. This isn’t some TikTok mindset fluff. It’s backed by neuroscience, behavioral science, and the best longform thinkers on the internet. After sorting through all the BS online, here’s the real framework that worked.  
  
  
  
1. Selfimage is a selffulfilling prophecy (so update the script)    
   inspired by Dr. Maxwell Maltz (PsychoCybernetics)  
  
   Your brain acts like a heatseeking missile. It adjusts behavior based on the selfimage it holds.    
   If you see yourself as undisciplined, your actions will match that belief.    
   Maltz, a plastic surgeon turned psychologist, realized many patients still ""felt ugly"" despite dramatic changes. He coined the idea that you act like the person you believe yourself to be.    
   To reprogram:    
Visualize yourself as the future version not vaguely, but with specific traits, clothes, habits, and emotions.    
Use identitybased affirmations: not “I will be wealthy,” but “I am the kind of person who manages money with clarity and confidence.”    
Anchor these visuals daily. This isn’t some woowoo thing. It’s cognitive rehearsal used by Olympians and Navy SEALs.  
  
  
  
2. Behavior follows identity (not the other way around)    
   from James Clear, author of “Atomic Habits”  
  
   Clear makes the case that every habit is a vote for the type of person you believe you are.    
   People struggle to stick to habits because they chase outcomes instead of evolving their identity.    
   Shift from “I want to write a book” to “I am a writer who writes every day.”    
   Practical tip:    
Don't ask “What do I want to achieve?” Ask, “Who do I need to become?”    
Then reverse engineer the behavior. Writers write. Fit people train. Wealthy people budget.    
  
  
  
3. Your environment is coding your subconscious (you HAVE to change it)    
   from Dr. Andrew Huberman, Stanford neuroscientist (Huberman Lab Podcast)  
  
   According to Huberman, the brain is plastic it rewires based on repeated experience and cues.    
   Your physical and digital environment reinforce who you think you are.    
   If you scroll broke creators and chaos daily, your brain gets wired for that.    
   Restructure your inputs:    
Curate a “signalrich” feed: longform podcasts (like “Modern Wisdom,” “The Diary of a CEO”), not 10second TikToks.    
Set up a “future self” zone: your room, soundtracks, vision board, even browser bookmarks.    
   Treat every object and app as part of a system that’s either reinforcing or eroding your new identity.  
  
  
  
4. Social mirrors matter: upgrade your circle or you'll default back    
   backed by the Dunbar number theory & research by David McClelland (Harvard)  
  
   McClelland’s research showed your reference group accounts for up to 95% of your success.    
   The people around you give you identity feedback loops. If everyone expects you to stay small, that becomes your box.    
   Start small:    
Join online forums, Discord groups, or masterminds where the norm is excellence.    
Consume content by people living the life you want not just influencers, but thinkers like Naval Ravikant, Hormozi, Maya Grossman.    
Audit who gets your time weekly. Are they aligned with your new selfconcept?  
  
  
  
5. Repetition is identity glue: you need daily rituals, not peak moments    
   confirmed in BJ Fogg's “Tiny Habits” research (Stanford Behavior Design Lab)  
  
   Identity change isn’t one big breakthrough. It’s microproof every day.    
   Fogg’s research found that small wins repeated consistently create massive behavior compounding.    
   Try this:    
Anchor tiny identity habits after existing routines.    
After brushing teeth → 1minute gratitude as future self.    
After your first coffee → write 1 sentence toward your content brand.    
Don’t underestimate these. Small identity deposits add up faster than forced “discipline” sprints.  
  
  
  
6. Create visible progress evidence or your brain forgets the identity shift    
   from “The Gap and The Gain” by Dan Sullivan & Dr. Benjamin Hardy  
  
   The brain needs concrete proof that change is happening. Otherwise it defaults to “nothing is working.”    
   Keep an identity tracker, not just a todo list.    
Log all wins, no matter how small: published a post, landed a client, said no to a bad invite.    
Reflect weekly. Repetition + reflection = reinforcement.    
   This simple shift builds selftrust the currency of all growth.  
  
  
  
What changed for me once identity clicked:  
  
 Made my first 6 figures from freelance and digital content in under a year.    
 Traveled to 12 countries while working remotely.    
 Built deep aligned friendships and let go of people who anchored my old story.    
 Started building an audience on platforms by being the person instead of waiting to feel ready.  
  
This identity work is deeper than goalsetting. Start seeing yourself as the creator of data not a consumer of advice. And the better your selfconcept, the less you need to force motivation.  
  
Your actions will start to catch up because your brain hates being wrong about who you are.",3,1770843270.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

My goal was simple: ditch the tourist traps, live like a local, and make my meager savings stretch. This isn't about luxury; it's about genuine discovery.

**The Cost Breakdown (2 Months / 60 Days)**

Here's the raw truth of where my money went:

*   **Flights:** €320 (Round trip from major hub to Portugal via budget airline)
*   **Accommodation:** €580 (Avg. €9.60/night – mostly hostels, 10 days Couchsurfing, a few cheap Airbnbs outside city centers)
*   **Food:** €450 (Avg. €7.50/day – markets, cooking, local bakeries, *tons* of amazing street food)
*   **Local Transport/Activities:** €150 (Free walking tours, metro passes, day trips, occasional museum)

**Total: €1500** 🤯

---

**What Worked (and Where I Found the Real Deal)**

*   **Lisbon, Portugal:** Hands down, my favorite. Skip the queues for Pastéis de Belém. Instead, find a small, unnamed *tasca* (local eatery) away from the main drag. The €8 ""prato do dia"" (dish of the day) I had with wine and coffee was pure magic.
*   **Krakow, Poland:** Unbelievably affordable and rich in history. The Jewish Quarter's street food (especially *zapiekanka*) is a must. We spent €12 on a full dinner with beer.
*   **Budapest, Hungary:** The ruin bars are iconic, but the thermal baths (Széchenyi is great, but try Gellért for something different) are a true local experience. Food markets here are your best friend for fresh, cheap eats.
*   **Slow Travel:** Seriously, don't rush. Spending 5-7 days in a city instead of 2-3 lets you really explore, find local spots, and save on constant inter-city transport. I often took overnight buses or trains to save on accommodation *and* travel costs.
*   **Walking Tours:** Always start with a free walking tour. They're tip-based, full of history, and led by locals who often share the best non-touristy spots.

---

**What I'd Skip (Unpopular Opinion Alert)**

> Unpopular opinion: The Eiffel Tower from below is stunning. The view *from* it? Overpriced, crowded, and honestly, you can get better city panoramas from other, less chaotic spots (like Montparnasse Tower or Sacré-Cœur Basilica). Save your money for a phenomenal picnic by the Seine instead.

---

**Real Talk Section: Here's What Sucked (and What I Learned)**

*   **Exhaustion is Real:** Moving every few days and constantly being ""on"" can be draining. There were days I just wanted to binge Netflix in a quiet corner. Pace yourself.
*   **The ""Luxury"" of a Good Night's Sleep:** Not every hostel bed is a dream. Some dorms are loud, some mattresses feel like concrete. Budget sleep means sacrificing comfort sometimes.
*   **Food FOMO:** Yes, I missed out on some ""must-try"" restaurants. But I gained so many incredible, spontaneous, and truly authentic culinary experiences by eating where the locals did. It's a trade-off.
*   **Language Barriers:** Google Translate is a lifesaver, but genuine connection often requires a few local phrases. ""Dziękuję"" (Polish for thank you) went a long way!

The landscape was a blur of green and gold outside the window, and for the first time, it actually hit me: I was actually *doing* this. No safety net, no itinerary buddy, just me and my beat-up backpack. It wasn't the 'epic adventure of a lifetime' I'd seen on Instagram; it was quieter, a little nerve-wracking, and completely real.

Before I left, I’d heard all the hype about solo travel, but honestly, nobody really tells you about the mundane parts, the little hiccups, or the sheer *relief* when you just figure something out. This isn't a glossy brochure; it's what actually went down.

Here’s the rundown from my first solo run through Eastern Europe:

*   **The Route (Roughly 3 weeks):**
    *   **Budapest, Hungary:** Kicked things off here. Easy entry, great vibe for getting used to being alone.
    *   **Belgrade, Serbia:** Took an overnight train, which was an experience in itself. Grittier, but incredibly vibrant.
    *   **Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina:** Bus ride in. A city with a heavy history but an incredible spirit.
    *   **Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina:** Day trip from Sarajevo, then stayed a night. That bridge is something else.
    *   **Split, Croatia:** Another bus, then a ferry. Mediterranean cool-down to finish.

*   **The Budget (Ballpark Figures):**
    *   **Accommodation:** Mostly hostels, average €15-25/night. Splurged on one private room for €40 in Mostar for a quiet night.
    *   **Transport:** Trains were €20-40 for longer hauls (like Budapest-Belgrade). Buses were king for inter-city travel in the Balkans, usually €10-25 per journey. Local transport was just a few euros.
    *   **Food & Drink:** This was a pleasant surprise. I mostly ate at local bakeries, markets, and casual restaurants. Daily average was around €20-35, including a coffee or a local beer.
    *   **Activities:** Usually €5-15 for museum entries or walking tours. Sometimes just wandering was free and the best activity.
    *   **Total Daily Spend:** I managed to keep it pretty consistently around **€50-70 per day** once transport between cities was factored out. This wasn't 'budget extreme,' but comfortable.

*   **Logistics & Life Savers:**
    *   **SIM Card:** Absolutely essential. Picked one up right at the airport in Budapest. Google Maps, translation apps, and WhatsApp for family check-ins are non-negotiable.
    *   **Booking:** Hostels via Hostelworld a day or two in advance. Bus/train tickets often bought at the station a few hours before departure, or sometimes online if I was feeling organised. *Flexibility was key here.*
    *   **Packing:** Less is always more. I started with too much, ended up wearing the same 5 outfits on repeat. Invest in good walking shoes.

**Real Talk – What Actually Happened:**

Look, it wasn't all sunsets and profound revelations. There were moments of *actual* loneliness, usually when I'd just arrived in a new city and hadn't found my footing or met anyone yet. There was the time I almost missed my bus to Sarajevo because the station wasn't clearly signposted, and my Serbian was, shall we say, non-existent. There were nights I ate dinner alone and just scrolled through my phone, feeling a bit adrift.

But then there were the unexpected wins:
*   The overwhelming kindness of strangers who helped me navigate a bus station with hand gestures and a smile.
*   The hostel common rooms where I instantly connected with other solo travelers over a shared beer, swapping stories and tips.
*   The incredible, inexpensive food – the burek in Sarajevo, the cevapi in Belgrade, the fresh seafood in Split. My taste buds had a field day.
*   The quiet satisfaction of figuring out public transport in a completely new city all by myself. It’s a small victory, but it feels huge when you're alone.
*   That moment staring at the Stari Most bridge in Mostar, watching the divers, feeling truly present and content.

My biggest takeaway? It’s not about being fearless; it’s about **being adaptable**. It's about accepting that some days will be amazing, and some will just be 'fine,' and that's okay. It’s about learning to trust your own gut and discovering that you're far more capable than you probably give yourself credit for. I didn't return a 'changed person' in some dramatic, movie-montage way. I returned a slightly more confident, slightly less anxious, and definitely more self-reliant version of myself.

Next scene Peter get's he's kidnapped and meets Damain who noticed who he is right away and starts to question him, they arrive at this place and it's like a lab of some kind anyways him and Peter make their way deeper and find this lab that has all this stuff and Damian says something that causes Peter to say well I'm your friend, (sorry if this is jumping around I'm trying to put it in order the best way I remember.) But anyways Dick (Nightwing) asks Damian where he's at and he says We are heading deeper into the lavatory? And Bruce has no idea about Peter and at this point from what I can remember Jason, Tim, Barbara, and Dick and also now Damian only know about Peter so Bruce is wondering who Damain is talking about while his kids try to make sure he doesn't meet Peter, anyways cutting a bunch as I forgot a lot of it to where Damian and Peter are waiting for Bruce and Batman shows up and asks if they're okay and Peter lists of his injuries like a soldier.

That's all I can remember of this I really tried to remember more but no luck and same with the name I tried to find it on my own and just can't seem to so I'm hoping I'm remembering it wrong and it's not the case of the Author deleting the story.

CH - 01 the hunter & me.

There I was, trying to sleep in. While a somewhat restless hunter began to move around.

for the first time in a while since I got lazy about it.

Nearly a week since finishing college. I'd moved to a quieter small beach town instead of the busy city where I'd originally lived. 

During my college years, I discovered that city life wasn't for me. What can I say? I like things to be simple. I enjoy the simplicity and slower pace of small beach town life.

Besides, these days most hunters head to big cities to capture and kill magical creatures like me.

It was just last Friday night before I moved when I saw some new vampires hunting on succubi turf. Not wanting to get caught in a turf war before I could leave the city, I thought I would jump in to help the targeted guy escape. 

But he staked one after the other straight in the heart and killed them as if he'd planned it all along.

Then, unexpectedly, from nowhere another hunter double-crosses. shot him in the back, probably working for some big vampire boss leaving the handsome hunter there to die alone in an alley.

But he smelled so good I couldn't leave him, he carried the scent of blood and of salt sweat, warm skin, and something smoked tobacco addictive like adrenaline. Before I knew it, I took him along with me to see what kind of dreams a man like him had. Once I tasted one of his sex dreams and I was certain I had to save him.

As a half-blood, I wasn't sure my efforts would work. But lady luck was on my side. A few days later, he woke up with his nearly commando body right next to mine.

""Where am I ?"" he asked, sounding somewhat angry, getting away from me.

""Come back and cuddle me! You're so warm and I'm cold,"" I said, eyes still shut.

""I get that you're angry and confused, but please come back. I'll answer any question if you cuddle me until I'm ready to get up. I promise.""

Let me say this: his body fits mine perfectly, like a warm glove.

""Thank you!"" I murmured as his warm pelvis slotted right against my soft, squishy ass.

""So..."" He softened his voice, whispering in my ear oh boy, that was hot. His voice was so sexy.

""What can you remember?"" I asked, grabbing his hands from my hips and guiding them up to my boobs.

""The vampires... Do you need my hands there just to answer?"" he protested, but he couldn't help squeezing my boobs a little.

""Yeah, it's nice and you're so warm... What I saw that day was another hunter shooting you in the back, execution-style.""

""What are you?""

""Don't worry... I'm like a chimera, a mix of a bunch of stuff and a whole 100% of nothing. What matters is that you're still human,"" I said, feeling his boner growing while I enjoyed his healthy body heat and that ever-evolving erection.

""Half-blood?""

""Yeah.""

""Where are we?""

""Some quiet, nice beach town, very far from anywhere anyone might think to look about 10 miles south of Westville,"" I said, dragging the tips of my fingers along his forearms, leaving gentle track marks.

""Don't people say this town is cursed?""

""People say all kinds of stuff. Doesn't mean you have to believe it!""

""So what are you?""

""Someone with a lot of time on her hands who does some alchemy on the side, I guess.""

""You're not saying then...""

""Let's play a game and see how good of a hunter you are. You can touch me anywhere and try to find out what I am. I'll let you know if you're hot or cold with your guesses,"" I said gently, grabbing his hand and guiding it all over my body.

""You're not cold enough to be mostly a vampire! But you still smell slightly like one.""

""That's a funny way to say I stink,"" I teased, slightly offended by his first assessment.

""But your temperature changes when I touch you in certain places,"" he said, moving his hands down toward my underwear, gently hovering over my clitoris.

""Who wouldn't act like that when you have someone like you so close? It's normal to feel aroused.""

""You don't have any scar tissue in your back that would indicate wings, and your hair isn't pixie-like in shape or colour. Can you please turn toward me?"" He gently felt my shoulder blades.

Once I turned, I was facing his broad, warm chest. Caught up in his arousal, my hand went toward his lovely-sized erection, letting me play with it.

""Succubus.""

""What gives it away?"" I asked as he brought my hands back up toward his lovely hip handles.

""I noticed that fact... I don't have any desire to kill right now. Is that because of your succubus power? Am I one of your many minions from now on?""

""First things first, yes and no. My blood may have saved you, but I didn't make you a minion, and I don't have any!"" I said, moving away from him and putting on some clothes, as if he'd touched a sore topic.

""I thought all succubi and incubi had hundreds of minions.""

""Well, normally they do,"" I said, pointing to some clean clothes he could put on.

""I couldn't leave you in your bloody hunter clothes. I placed them somewhere they can't be tracked.""

""That was a lie so new recruits would stop losing their uniforms.""

""Noted.""

""What is your name? Mine is Antony.""

""Olivia.""

""So, Olivia, how come you're a half-breed?""

""My family is full of questionable alchemists trying to create the most powerful humans. During my parents' and grandparents' experiments by adding 25% vampire blood and 35% succubus blood to their diet while pregnant you get a 40% human with vampire and succubus traits,"" I said, handing him a coffee mug.

""You know alchemy on top of that? Those markings on your body are those alchemy symbols?""

""Yeah.""

""Aren't they simple ones?""

""That is by design. If I'd made them more complicated, I could have, but that would attract more attention than I want. Some attention from annoying people would be truly bothersome... Besides, I applied way more powerful alchemy to the ink.""

""So, Olivia, what is your last name?"" he asked in a very charming way.

""Are you hungry?""

""As long as I'm not on the menu.""

""I just have a bite when I'm being offered. Are you offering too?"" I said, showing him my tongue in a teasing way.

""I am connected to you in any way?""

""On your dreams.""

""Seriously?""

""I am. The more important question is what you're going to do about the hunters after you,"" I said, tossing him a roll of newspapers.

""Have they started a war?""

""Yeah, we managed to leave just in time. You're welcome to stay for as long as you want.""

""What is the catch?""

""There is no catch. I experienced your sex dream energy, and no, I didn't have sex with someone who was unconscious and on their death's door if that's what you're wondering.""

""How come I woke up pretty much naked, then?""

""That was so I could heal you,"" I said, as if it wasn't obvious.

""How's my condition, Doc?"" he joked, sitting on a chair facing the beach on our balcony.

""You'll live!"" I said, enjoying the morning sun heat from the shade on the balcony.

""Olivia, I've seen many vampires combust from being this close to sunlight,"" he asked casually, trying to be coy about it.

""I'm somewhat sensitive under actual sunlight, but my succubus blood loves the heat,"" I said, trying not to give any hints about how I dealt with the whole sun factor.

""So you're like a horny lizard with temperature regulation issues,"" he said with a boyish charm that made me want to be even closer, basking in his body heat.

The moment he raised his arms for a stretch, I took the opportunity to sit on top of his lap, disrupting his view of the ocean with my back at first. Then I lay back against his body like a big, warm human chair.

""Do you mind?"" I asked when I rested my head on his shoulder as I gazed at the ocean.

CH - 02 the Hunter stays.

Today when I first woke up, something that not too long ago seemed so normal now feels empty.

The moment a windy draft fueled the space where Antony had been occupying right next to me in bed, I shifted relentlessly, trying to accumulate any warmth left by his body before getting up.

""Has he left?"" I said somewhat aloud, knowing I would need some piping hot coffee to help me warm up.

I'm caught by surprise when I see him sleeping on the living room sofa.

When I am about to snuggle up to him, I hear a knock coming from the front door, not too far away from us.

Not knowing who it might be, I used some of my vampire traits to see if I could recognize the smell of the person outside.

The second sharp knock rang out and startled Antony awake. He jolted off the sofa, ready to slay.

""Don't worry, this is Mrs. More,"" I say, using my short-lived speed to open the door.

""Olivia, my girl, I saw the young man running a few laps around. Is he better than?"" she asks, smothering me in a tight, wet, clammy hug.

""Yes, Mrs. More, but you are cold and clammy.""

""Oh dear, so sorry, sometimes I forget how sensitive you are!"" she says with an air of her own silliness.

""Do you need anything?""

""Ah, yes... In a few weeks we will have fireworks to celebrate a warm and fruitful summer, and we would like to invite you and your male friend to watch as a thank you for fixing the barriers,"" she says when she hears someone call for her.

""Need to run, dear.""

""I see you then, Mrs. More,"" I say, keeping her at arm's length as she tries to go for another hug.

""See you soon then,"" she says in her nymph voice on her way toward the front garden.

""Is she a water nymph?"" Antony asks as he hands me a hot mug of coffee.

""Man, you're probably the worst person to play 'supernatural guess who' against!"" I say as we sit on the big sofa.

""Knowing what I was hunting was part of my job,"" he said, patting me on the head.

""Right, I guess you were doing some reconnaissance then?""

""Well, if I am staying here for a while, I need to know my surroundings,"" he says in a nonchalant way.

""Are you really staying then?"" I say, overjoyed.

""Yeah, but...""

""But what?"" I interrupt, not liking the ""but.""

""I am aware that you fully healed me, but I cannot keep sharing the bed with you.""

""Well, I do enjoy sharing the bed with you and sucking up some of the heat you generate.""

""For now, I am sleeping on the sofa,"" he says in a very certain way.

""But the bed is far more comfortable than the sofa,"" I protest. On the sofa, enjoying the heat next to him, I end up placing my legs over his lap.

""I have stayed in far more questionable places,"" he says, playing with my lower legs.

""I could use alchemy to create you a new room.""

""Olivia, I don't know much about you or how your power works...""

""It should be fine, as long as I have the raw materials needed for the conversion.""

""I know that alchemy and magic take a toll on the caster... What if it takes more than you realize? You just healed me,"" he says, as if he will not be able to change his mind.

CH - 03 A fever changes things.

Last night Antony and I went to the beach shore to watch some fireworks displays.

The moon was full and bright, the breeze was cool and fresh after a few hot days we had.

While I was still beaming from all that heat, from the heatwave I suggested that we stayed there for a little while longer. 

Even though he warned me I may catch a cold, I managed to convince him to stay there saying I was fine. On our way back home I started to sneeze.

""Are you cold?"" He asked while reaching for my hands.

""NO."" I say while enjoying the heat coming from his palm when our fingers  interlocked.

""Come closer!"" He says bring me closer to his torso while giving me a side hug, with his arm around my neck and shoulders. Making me very cozy in his body heat like a warm scarf on a breezy night, until we got back.

""You should have a warm shower to help you to get warm” He says while looking for something.

""Do you want to join in?"" I say knowing he probably will say no.

""Just go and I'll meet you there."" He says going toward the kitchen.

Once I turned the tap, the water felt freezing, so I decide to have a quick  shower by myself instead of waiting for him 

Because let's be honest, cold showers aren't sexy, but when I look up to be hot the temperature is turned all the way up. It seems that the shower temperature is broken and I made a mental note to fix it tomorrow.

When I hear knocking on the door.

""Are you done?"" He handed me the towel.

""The shower is broken""

""Are you sure?""

""Yeah, just cold water is coming out."" I say with the towel around my waist covering some of my body.

""Olivia, Maybe you should go to bed!"" he says somewhat worried.

“You don't want to stay up and play some  games?” I ask, seeing a blurred version of him.

""Why don't we play tomorrow?"" he says, coming closer to me, as I lose my balance and fall toward him.

""I've lost my balance.” I say as he puts his arms around me like a hug and carries me to the bedroom, places me in the bed and tosses something towards me.

""Put them on, I am going to get some water."" he says as he leaves the room.

When I looked at what he threw at me was one of his underwear, it looked pretty comfy. I smiled and put them on. They were boxers with the right amount of air flow.

I decided to go under the quilt because I was feeling very cold. But once I closed my eyes for a second and the next thing  was morning. 

Antony is there to cuddle me! Since he woke-up a few weeks ago he has been making a fuss of sleeping on the living room sofa. But I am far more cozy with him here next to me.

So I lay there on top of his chest as he moved his hand towards my forehead.

""You still have a fever,"" he says in a sleep haze.

""Me a fever?"" I say surprised.

""Don't tell me, you don't know what a fever is?"" He asked somewhat perplexed.

""I have read about it, but never experienced it."" I say dumbfounded.

""Do you think it will affect you the same?” he asks while being a bit extra touchy and feel today.

""No, not really""

“Do you feel stranger than normal?""

""Well, your touch feels extra warm to me and when I touch you I feel a little tingle, a good one I mean."" I say while enjoying the feeling of intoxication coming from his body heat as I brush my hand up and down between his chest and defined waistline.

He uses his nice strong arms that are under me to bring me even closer to him so I can feel his morning wood brush against my naked belly.

“Have you gone commando?!” I ask as I feel his penis twitch in excitement.

""No, but your sweat must have melted them."" he says, feeling my waist and making all the way down to my ass.

""What's up Antony?"" I asked knowing that he doesn't start things normally.

“My body isn't responding to me.” he says in a sexy way.

""Come on, I know that I can be cheeky but I never lied to you about enjoying touching you.”

""Olivia, last night I felt somewhat the same way before you had the shower… Until you washed your sweat away.” He says putting one on top of his erection.

""Are you suggesting that my sweat is causing you to be horny?"" I asked while he began to move me up and down on a dry hump. That made me sweat even more.

""How did you manage to spend the entire night and not hump me?"" I question as he tense his muscles and press them harder against me.

""When I came back with some water for you, you were  asleep and had a fever.” He says reluctant to continue.

“Come on, tell me. I don't want to have sex with someone under my influence!"" I say knowing my words are betraying me, and aware that if he continued this with his penis would eventually go in.

""I took care of business before coming and hugging you?"" He says, reaching for my boobs, his hands were strong and warm.

""Ok, let me take care of you now."" I whisper in his ears before kissing his jawline making my way down towards his penis.

That had his unique smell: a mix of fresh sweat and hormones. While I kissed the exterior of his penis as he felt my boobs.

But the moment I dragged the tip of my tongue touching the base of his penis all the way to the top and a moment later inserted inside my soft wet mouth against his lovely erection.

He stopped moving for a second and allowed me to help him out.",2,1770843028.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1r296h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1r296h0/28_m4f_phillynearby_areasusa_seeking_my_forever/,28 [M4F] Philly/nearby areas/USA- Seeking my forever snow day partner!,"Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly
* NOT a cigarette smoker!

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty

1r29400,https://i.redd.it/1jm9cy3sgxig1.png,Claude was burning tokens. I built a local context engine to fix it.,"Claude Code is amazing… but it gets expensive fast. And if you try running it with smaller/local models? They struggle hard on big codebases because they don't actually understand your repo. They just glob/grep a bunch of files and basically guess - burns tokens and gives you noisy answers.

So I built LENS, mostly with Opus 4.6 while dogfooding Claude Code, then cleaned it up. Started as a small local tool for myself. It indexes your repo using TF-IDF + import graphs + git co-change history, then returns the right-ranked files in one MCP call. Instead of 20+ glob/grep rounds, Claude gets \~1-3KB of clean, relevant context. No LLMs involved at this point. Pure static analysis, runs in \~10ms.

`npm i -g lens-engine`  
`lens daemon start`  
`lens repo register`

That's it. register auto-creates the .mcp.json so Claude Code discovers LENS immediately, and injects a small instruction into your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so the agent knows to use it. Zero friction, just register and go.

What it actually does:

* TF-IDF keyword scoring (code-aware, not generic NLP)
* Import graph traversal (2-hop dependency chains)
* Git co-change pairs (files that always change together)
* File exports, docstrings, path tokens

Pro ($9/mo, coffee money) adds Voyage semantic embeddings and vocab clusters (export names clustered by semantic similarity) for even better ranking.

I'm trying study and for some odd reason, a vivid memory comes back of highschool from some idiot that wasted my time and then thought to bully me. It bothers me in the sense that I wish I could tell him off for wasting my time, as I'm sitting here studying. And then I'm reminded of that stupid bus I was on and how things were. Idk what this is. It happens before when I ruminate on a thought and get hyperactive. I had a latte and a black coffee. And I'm wired through the roof. I did feel low dose paroxetine helped with some symptoms, namely shutdowns and meltdowns. Small things became large for me, and bother me to no end. I don't want to hop on SSRIs again because the come off sucks, and I plan on asking my doc again for ADHD meds when I have a good time to experiment.

Appreciate anyone that can explain what this is and how to navigate it especially, thanks all.

edit: I read a comment earlier that Tetris also helps against rumination

edit 2: I think I'm focusing on the past and seeing things from others perspectives and it's really distracting me since it's running in the background. I hate tradition and culture and I think it takes up headspace and it's unneeded to conform to those ideals.

edit 3: headspace is especially something annoying me.

So a couple weeks ago I was having one of those days where nothing really goes wrong but everything feels kinda heavy? I was sitting outside the library just zoning out and this girl I’d never seen before walked up, handed me a little ziploc bag with a candy and a sticky note that just said ""hope your day gets better!! :)"" and then literally just walked away.

It was such a small thing but it genuinely made me smile so much??

So I decided to do the same for other people. I made like 10 little bags with candy and positive notes and left them around campus on benches, by the coffee machine, stuff like that. Thought that would be it.

Then someone posted in our uni's subreddit asking who ""the candy person"" was and like 50 people commented saying they'd either found one OR made one themselves and wanted to keep it going.

So my impulsive self was like ""ok new group chat it is""

That was two weeks ago and now we have over 300 MEMBERS. We literally have a whole system now?? People post when they're stressed about exams or having a rough week and someone drops off a little care package at their dorm. We have a shared map with pinned spots to leave anonymous notes. Someone's mom who owns a bakery started donating leftover pastries on Fridays. PASTRIES. I did not plan this.

The other day a girl posted that she was really nervous before a big presentation and someone left a little bag on her desk with a stress ball and a chocolate and she said it made her feel so supported she almost cried (happy tears!!).

I literally just wanted to pass on a nice moment and now I'm somehow running what feels like a 300-person ""let's be nice to strangers"" club??

Idk I just think it's really cool that so many people are willing to take five minutes out of their day to make someone else smile for no reason. 💛

Has anyone else ever started something small that just grew into a whole thing?? How do people even manage groups this size lol

1r2909w,https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/1r2909w/planning_out_new_washdisposal_procedure_looking/,"Planning out new Wash/Disposal Procedure, looking for Feedback","As the title says, I'm updating my method for washing/cleaning and disposing of stuff and I'm curious what I might be missing. I know I might be a bit overkill in some places, but I want to make things as easy for myself to follow and put in some padding where I might try to cut corners later (my old method definitely taught me I would do that). So, here's my current plan:

***Washing***

1. Gloves and an N95 mask.

2. Using a silicone baking tray with high walls, transfer the build plate to the washing station and remove the print from the plate.

3. Dunk the print in IPA a few times using [this pickle jar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BB2SDDWJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). Allow to dry.

4. For finer models (which, as a DM and a Warhammer player, is going to be most of them) transfer to [this sonicator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HGN40SQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1), which would be full of the Elegoo Resin Detergent, and run for about 5 minutes. Using the silicone tray, transfer to sink to rinse with warm water.

5. Grab a spray bottle full of IPA, hold the model over a dedicated waste bin and spray until the surface is decently saturated. This would remove any excess detergent/resin/water and would also dry way faster than just waiting for water.

6. Allow to dry and cure as normal.

7. Silcone mat and the build plate can be wiped off with paper towels, and can be scrubbed with IPA or soap/water as needed.

***Disposal***

1. IPA dunk solution will sit in indirect sunlight, and, as I have two of them, can be moved to direct sunlight to let the resin cure and settle for a few days as needed. Once that is done, I can use a coffee filter to filter as much as possible and potentially reuse the IPA. If it's too far gone for that, I can put the spent IPA back into the container I bought it in and toss it in the waste bin.

2. The detergent in the sonicator will almost never need to be replaced, just refilled, but if it needs to be I can also put it back in the original container I bought it in and add it to the waste bin.

3. The waste bin is for the used gloves, masks, paper towels, supports, spent solution bottles, filters, etc. This bin will sit in my outdoor shed when not in use. When it gets full, I'll take it to the local recycling center. Granted, it's only going to need taken out every couple of months.

I'm using the Elegoo detergent mainly because a) I'm not totally sure how airtight the sonicator is and would like something that doesn't smell and b) I just happened to already have it.",5,1770842583.0,resinprinting,6,0.86,False

I was fired from my job as a remote software engineer, bastards cut me after a simple mistake that ended up causing downtime for a client. With the way the job market is now there’s no chance I’ll be able to find another work from home gig. After a few days of sulking and day drinking I decided that I should start applying for work. My education in computer science and 10 years of experience should place me somewhere rather quickly, but the effort of getting up and going to interviews was almost too much to handle.

“Find anything today hunny?” my wife asked me in her sweet southern drawl. “Not anything worth chasing” I replied, exhausted from doing nothing. “It’ll be ok, I just know you’ll find something better than those assholes at the last place, it wasn’t even your fault”. I turned to her, she planted a kiss on my forehead and she sauntered away, off to cook another meal I feel I didn’t deserve. In truth, it was my fault, a junior engineer changed a few lines of code without testing it and shipped the update, guess who his supervisor is that should have double tested it behind him. Carelessness is a symptom of my growing depression I guess.

Hours of time spent in front of the computer on indeed, Glassdoor, and whatever other kind of sketchy sites desperate people find themselves on, yielded very little in the way of actual progress in my job search. Nevertheless I did submit my resume to at least 100 positions, I am caught in the trap of being very well qualified with great experience and no jobs that are looking to pay me what I deserve, capitalism is a bitch. One job I applied to and then interviewed for, a senior software developer 2 states over, the interviewer asked me why I thought this job would be the correct fit, I gave the proper interview answer bullshit, at the end she said in the most condescending way, “I think your resume is perfect and your experience is great but you just don’t seem like a people’s person, and this position requires good customer service skills”. Maybe she was right, maybe I’ll just keep door dashing and ubering for the rest of my life.

Day 31 of my job search, I woke up, booted my laptop, my wife placed a cup of coffee on my desk, whispered “today is a new day, good luck” and planted a kiss on my cheek then left for work. Alone again. I filtered through my emails, half heartedly looking for an interview request, denial, something. As I scroll I see it

\[Interview Accepted\]-Sight Supervisor- 1:00 pm today

Did I accept an interview for this position? I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs but I don't remember accepting an interview for a “sight supervisor”, did they mean Site supervisor? It doesn’t even have the company name. I’m getting desperate so I click the calendar invite and add it.

Lunch time rolls around, I have my traditional turkey sandwich and a coke. I took a hot shower, shaved and put on a collared shirt, ready for this interview that I somehow accepted and dammit I was going to be prepared. 1 o’clock rolls around and I am let into the Zoom meeting, there is a man, stocky build with a navy polo sitting in the brightest office I have ever seen, and a woman whose camera is off. Brad and Janice. I wasn’t sure if the lighting in the office was due to a bad webcam, or if the sun was 10 feet away from the window, but it was so bright that I had to turn down my laptop brightness and adjust my eyes to the screen.

“Hello Jay”, Brad greeted me in a velvet smooth voice, almost as if you could hear the country club he played at this morning. “It’s nice to have you sit down with us this afternoon, we looked over your application and I must say we are impressed.” “Thank you sir, I replied in my best southern professional tone. “We’re expanding our software lineup here at Holloway industries, and we think that your background could be an excellent fit”. Holloway industries? I've never heard of that company before and certainly don't remember applying to a position there. “Uh, that sounds great!” I nervously replied. “Wonderful, Janice here has some questions, she is the direct superior for this position ill be in touch after your interview” Brad disconnected. “Hi Jay!” came across my speakers in a bright and loud tone. “I am so excited to meet you and potentially have you on our team!” Her demeanor was unlike any other I have encountered in my job search. “Pleased to meet you” I replied, sheepishly. Janice was overbearingly nice, excited and engaged, almost to a fault. Who were these people and why did they seem to want me so badly? The interview went on with the same 6 or 7 questions I have answered at least a dozen times, as I was settling back into my routine, Janice threw me off once again. “How is your eyesight?”. That was odd, I have never been asked that in an interview before, not wanting to fuck this up I replied honestly: “Well I wear contacts, my far sight has slowly been degrading but my near sight is just fine”. “Perfect!” she replied as if she had just found a $100 bill on the floor. She was just too excited, or maybe I was too depressed, either way I needed this job, so I grinned and bared while looking at the blank profile picture. “ last question”  she added “If you were to be offered this position, when could you start?” I replied “Tomorrow”. That answer was music to her ears, I've never heard someone so excited during an interview.

The interview concluded after about 30 minutes of talking to Janice, the most overwhelming person I have met in a long time. “Be on the lookout for an email by the end of the day. We’re so glad to-” she stopped before she said too much too soon. “Have a good evening, Jay” I replied “You do the same”. I closed my laptop with confidence that I could be employed by tomorrow. 6 o'clock rolls around and I am in the kitchen when my wife comes in the door. She looked almost surprised that I wasn't in my office or the bedroom, I had rarely left since losing my job. “How was your day hunny?” I greeted warmly. “It was ok, another day, another 50 cents or so, how about you, what's got you so chipper?” I explained the very odd interview that I had and how I thought I had it in the bag, just that I was waiting on an email with their decision. “That's wonderful hun, I'm so proud of you” a warm kiss landed on my lips. “Im gonna go shower and then perhaps we can celebrate”, said with a devious look on her face. While Kate was in the shower my phone dinged that familiar pattern when an email arrived.

\[Offer Enclosed\]- Sight Supervisor- Holloway industries

“Hot Damn” I thought to myself, opening the email and taking a look at its contents. My starting salary was thirty thousand more than my last job, and my start date is tomorrow. The address for orientation was right in town. How have I never heard of these people, I'm still not sure what they do or even who they are. Who was Brad? What did Janice look like? So many unanswered questions that were sure to be answered tomorrow. No chance in hell I’m not showing up. I cooked a nice spaghetti for Kate and I in which I shared the good news. The look of relief on her face could fill a thousand barrels. “Oh my god, I knew you could do it” she got up from the table and filled my face with her warm kisses. I am surprised the celebration didn't take place right here in the kitchen.

After a night of spaghetti, wine and celebration, I awoke to my alarm clock, its tone I hadn't heard in over a month. I stumbled to the bathroom, showered, brushed my teeth, combed my hair and put on cologne that Kate gifted to me last christmas. All the while she was in bed. Orientation starts at 9, it is 8:15. I made her a cup of coffee and set it on the nightstand, and gave her a warm kiss on the cheek. “Good luck” she whispered, “I know you’ll do great”. She was my rock, my everything in this exact moment. “Thank you, I love you” I replied.

I made it to the office building at about 8:45, it was a nondescript 3 storey building right outside downtown, one that I had passed numerous times without a thought. On the door “Holloway Industries” printed in block lettering. I pushed the handle down and stepped into the atrium.

As the door opened a tone went off and a security panel chimed “front door” in a flat, artificial tone. There was a reception area, with a young lady sitting behind it. She looked toward the door and said with a warm tone “Welcome to Holloway!” “Hello there” I answered back, “Im Jay, I start orientation today for the Sight Supervisor” whatever that means. “Its so nice to meet you, Jay, we’re so glad to have you”. On the desk there was a name plate: Julie. She arose from her seat and came around to greet me. She was much shorter than I am, but she stared directly at my chest, she held out her hand for a handshake, I shook it, she then said “Follow me this way”. How odd, maybe she's autistic and doesn't make eye contact well. Whatever the case may be, I followed her to the elevator. Her fingers grazed the call button, which she pressed and the doors soon opened. “You are going to the third floor, There will be another person to meet you” she added, still not making eye contact. “Thank you” I said kindly, getting into the elevator and pressing 3. There was a clock mounted on the panel. It flashed 12:00:00 repeatedly, as if it had lost power at some point and no one reset it. I double checked my phone and made sure i was on time: 8:52

On arrival to the third floor I stepped into a hallway. The lighting was dim, as if half of the lights were out or turned off. There was another reception desk with an older, slim lady. She called out “Hello there, Welcome to Holloway.” in a monotone bored manner. Finally, someone I can relate to. Her gaze was fixed to the computer, a flickering mess right out of 2009. “Hi there” I greeted, “Im Jay, here for orientation”. Sounding rather annoyed and not looking at me she got up from her seat and said “Follow me”. She took me around what seemed to be a maze of hallways, and some seem too long to be contained in the building we were in. The lights were still half out in some areas but fully bright in others. There were glass offices with no one in them and wooden doors with plates that read “Janitorial” and “Storage”. We finally got into a conference room, the lady I was following instructed me to take a seat and I obliged. “Janice will be right with you” said in a tone so monotone it would put you to sleep. “I didn't catch your name, earlier” but by the time I was able to say it the door was closed.

Being respectful of the work environment I resisted pulling out my phone for what felt like an hour, it was eerily quiet, but the conference room had large windows to see out to the neighborhood behind, I spent some time looking out, waiting for Janice and preparing myself for the onslaught of energy that i will endure in the coming moments. Finally bored enough I pulled out my phone. I had a text from Kate and a couple of emails from jobs I'd applied to. The text read “Have a great first day, I love you, Dinner at Sancho’s tonight?” Sancho’s was my favorite Mexican restaurant, and I knew Kate hated eating there, so she must be really trying to congratulate me on this job. My eyes gazed at the clock: 9:05. That doesn't make any sense, we were walking for at least 5 minutes and I've been in here for at least an hour. Maybe the month of unemployment has messed with my sense of time. I texted Kate back and extended my excitement of dinner tonight, then I heard the click of the door opening.

“Jay! Its so nice to meet you in person!” I knew this excited tone anywhere. Janice is an average height, blonde with huge blue eyes, almost too big for her face. She quickly sat down on a laptop and came around the table, I half expected her to hug me. She reached out for a handshake and I obliged. “Its very nice to be here!” I extended back to her. “Let's get down to business shall we?” she started. A large projector screen extended down on the far side of the room and the projector whirred to life. She started a powerpoint on her laptop, and a blurry image filled the screen. “Shit” I thought to myself “I forgot my contacts”

The next day we set up another date for this weekend, specifically valentines day as it best lines up with both our jobs. I have been on a few dates before (like two or three depending on your definition of a date) but never one on valentines day so i feel really lost regarding expectations and obligations. I'm from the US by the way, just in case there are different cultural practices elsewhere.

Should I do anything special for her? I want to make her feel valued but i don't want to come off as overbearing or desperate. I was thinking of getting her a gift and maybe a box of chocolates.

As of now, the plan is a movie and dinner, but nothing that requires a reservation, as basically everything is completely booked (because it will be valentines). Think like Denny's or something like that. I really like this girl, and she is nice and our values and life plans align as best I can tell based off one date and some texting.

1r28sxe,https://i.redd.it/xb4t6k3sexig1.jpeg,"Looking for greater consistency [Profitec Move, DF54]","I am using a DF54 grinder from MiiCoffee and Profitec Move from Clive. No pre-infusion, water temp of 198 F, and a pre-set time of 30 seconds for extraction.

I use the medium basket that came with the Profitec, typically 18 or 18.5 grams in (depending on bean), and a 1.7mm puck screen. Puck prep is consistent and the shot is almost always even flow and without mess. I like the taste when it is 36-45 grams out.

The issue is that, even keeping all these parameters as consistent as possible, I still get variation on output. Sometimes it is in the sweet spot (for my taste and bean) of 36-45 grams out. But, sometimes it is 25 grams and other times it can be 50 grams out.

My beans are typically 3 weeks from roasting. (I learned on Reddit that I was pulling shots too soon after roasting). My grinder and espresso machine are 2 months broken in. I typically pull one shot per day.

I've tried an IMS basket without improvement. I’ve tried a larger basket without improvement. I've tried pre-infusion and it seemed more inconsistent. I tried buying expensive roasted beans from my local award-winning shop because I wondered if my roasting on the Ikawa Home roaster was inconsistent. That didn't help.

I am happy with the progress. Even when the shot output is 50 grams, it is decent tasting (with milk). But, I would like to see rock-solid consistency. Possible? Should I run the shot manually and just time it according to the output weight?",5,1770842114.0,espresso,17,0.86,False

1r28oc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1r28oc7/our_first_cruise_as_an_asian_married_couple/,Our First Cruise as an Asian Married Couple – Honest Experience.,"We just came back from our first cruise as an Asian married couple, and we were genuinely so excited. We had heard so many great things about Virgin Voyages, and we loved that it was adults-only.

We stayed in a Central Sea Terrace cabin, and the red hammock was definitely one of our favorite parts. The cabin was beautiful and comfortable. The Galley had great food, and overall the ship itself was stunning.

On our first night, we dined at Extra Virgin. There were two couples seated on our left and right. When our server explained the menu to us, she mentioned that the pasta portions were “very large” and shareable. The way it was explained made it seem like maybe we should just share one main dish. But when she spoke to the two couples beside us, the explanation felt different. There was no mention of sharing. When our food arrived, the portions weren’t actually that large. Maybe it was nothing, but it felt different to us.

The next morning at Razzle Dazzle, there was a group seated beside us. I noticed the couple next to us looking at us from head to toe multiple times. When their group arrived, the server asked them several times if they wanted coffee refills. We were never asked even once.

There was another moment at one of the bars when it felt like we were being avoided until my husband spoke up to order. Even when we said thank you, there was no response. Walking through the pool area, we felt certain looks again.

During disembarkation, one crew member was thanking and greeting people as they exited. When it was our turn, there was silence.

Maybe it was all coincidence. Maybe we were overthinking.

But when small moments like that happen repeatedly, it makes you quietly wonder.. was it because we are Asian?

I don’t want to assume. I don’t want to accuse. I’m simply sharing how it made us feel.

Because of those experiences, I ended up cancelling our dining reservations. I didn’t want the rest of our cruise to be overshadowed by discomfort.

Overall, the cruise itself was beautiful. The ship, the cabin, the food.. all wonderful. My husband reminded me that we paid just like everyone else, and we deserved to enjoy it fully.

He’s right.

But now I can’t help but wonder if we should go on a cruise again at all or maybe try a different cruise line next time. I don’t want a few uncomfortable moments to define our first cruise experience. I’m still grateful for the memories we made, the ocean views, the red hammock, and the fact that we experienced it together. I just hope that wherever we cruise next, we feel completely welcomed.",0,1770841826.0,VirginVoyages,20,0.31,False
1r28o9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r28o9p,Tea Snobbery is so real,"Today I got my new tea in the mail thinking that I'll be finally trying out a yellow tea. It didn't look like yellow tea that I've seen other people post but I looked up from Yunnan Sourcing and sure enough they had similar looking yellow tea to this one. 

Here comes the fun part. I brewed it at 80 C thinking this is yellow tea and suprise suprise, first flash steep gives out this floral sweet smell and taste. And I'm trying to convince myself that it tastes like sweet corn or hay, since that's what they say online. But nope, it is neither of those things. I keep brewing and the taste profile is eeringly similar to something I know for sure. 

Then I stare really hard at the wet leaves, they're freaking dark, as in red tea dark. It dawns on me that this is actually a Dianhong and the site I've purchased it from most certainly mixed up their stock. I check out the site, see that they list a Yunnan - Golden Tip black tea, but it is not called a black tea, they call it puerh black tea with two totally different product photos for it. One of them is the Dianhong and the other is a photo of an unknown puerh. So, yeah, they definitely mixed up their stock. 

Don't get me wrong, although they messed up my order and probably their site, it was a super delicious Dianhong. The real problem lies with my bias confirmation and trying to add descriptions when tasting the tea. I know my way around coffee and there were really crazy descriptions out there, and I always thought that they were so over the top. But here I am trying to taste a freaking sweet corn from tea just because someone on the internet said so.  

  
Another point is, I would never go as low as 80 C for black(red) tea under normal conditions but thanks to this mishap I'll give some of my lacking black teas a chance 80 C. I might have being just too uptight with my shallow tea knowledge. 

  
In short, just enjoy your tea folks, cheers.",46,1770841822.0,tea,15,0.85,False
1r28noj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1r28noj/i_am_in_search_of_answers_and_seek_help_in/,I am in search of answers and seek help in understanding.,"A bit of backstory, I was raised in a traditional Christian household and went to a Baptist church for the majority of my youth. I was always taught that the LDS church is untrue without ever really being given a reason as to why. It never bothered me, and I never looked into it until last year. I began dating a girl who happened to be a Mormon, whom I feel very, very deeply in love with. She was and still is the most incredible person I have ever known and the person I wish to marry one day. However, with the following information, you will see why I want to better my understanding of the LDS church and better myself to become a man worthy of marrying.  Our relationship never had issues other than the fact of our religious differences, and I ultimately let it drive us apart because I stayed stubborn and close-minded on all of the beliefs I didn't understand. I had been struggling in my relationship with God for a while, since about my sophomore year of high school. I ended up losing my best friend to suicide in September of last year, which brought me back to God in a big way. Losing him kept me thinking about the afterlife and what was really true when it came to religion so I began to look into Christianity, Catholicism, and Mormonism. I went into it with an open mind at the start but I had multiple people in my ear telling me that the LDS church was wrong for reasons like holding the idea of multiple gods and becoming a god after you pass or the tiers of heaven which sort of went against what I had been taught all my life and instead of processing these things with my own thoughts I decided to listen to them. It scared me, which brought forth stubbornness and a mindset that led me to only looking into the bad of the church, like the not-so-good things that happened in the past, which I realize now stands with any church you look into. History tends to always hold some ugly details no matter what you look at. But I decided to only focus on these things which wasn't fair of me at all. When I asked my girlfriend about these things, I would often get frustrated when she didn't have the perfect answer for me when I was struggling with understating which again was not fair of me at all, and I regret this very much. We had a conversation about a temple wedding and what it meant, and again I chose to be close-minded and not even try to understand the beauty of what she was telling me, which I really wish I could take back.  All of these small details ultimately built up to what ended our relationship, I had a project about financial scandals and while looking for a topic I fell into a rabbit hole on the whole situation from a couple years ago that involved the LDS church hiding a significant amount of money from its members which lead me to searching for even more wrong doing on behalf of the church and I realized (at least in that moment) I would never be able to adopt any of the beliefs the church held or get past my issues with some of the things they have done in the past. These doubts lead to fear that it would drive us apart later in life and cause a divorce, which is my biggest fear. I have changed my view on this, and doing research with a different mindset has led me to believe I can and will accept these things, and hopefully one day become a member. Anyways, divorce scares the heck out of me and is something I never want to experience, but I let an unsupported fear of the future destroy the most incredible part of my life and drive me to lose the most amazing girl I have ever known because I refused to let my stubbornness go. Since our separation, I have had so much time to reflect on myself, my beliefs, and the way I see the world, which led me to working at acceptance and better understanding the things I didn't.  In my time apart from her I decided to read the Book of Mormon she gave me and look for the good the church has to offer which I found and now I want to move forward but don't know how. I still have a lot of questions about the church's origins and many of the beliefs they hold. My main question is where do I go from here? Do any active members have doubts like this? Where do I turn with my questions and how do I let go of the doubts I have. I know that faith plays a massive part in all of this and I am really trying but doing it on my own seems scary and I don't want to lead myself in the wrong direction once again. I want to understand and ease my doubts as best I can. I have a list of issues that I still seek clarity on and if any of you have answers please let me know. Thank you guys! I really really look forward to hearing from this community. 

 

I hope that none of these questions come across as stupid or disrespectful. I promise I mean no disrespect, just clarification and I do apologize if they come across as stupid I am still new to this and I tried to come up with questions to ease my doubts and I really am forever grateful to anyone who takes the time to help me out with this, you are a blessing to me and to the world. 

  
1st - How do you guys explain Galatians 1:8

“But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."" 

2nd -  How do I get past the distrust I hold in the origin story? I want to believe but it all just seems fabricated (I promise I mean no disrespect with this I just want answers) Is there something I can read or watch that would help me better understand?

3rd - Why is coffee and tea bad but you are allowed to drink something like a monster or soda which is proven to be much more harmful to the body. I don't get how something natural like a bean or leaf, something god gave us, can be viewed as sinful when you are allowed to drink a mixture of chemicals. This is a dumb question to ask and I'm sorry, I don't drink either of them so it doesn't really matter much to me I am just truly curious about why. 

4th - The idea of there being more gods in the universe than stars in the sky. (I don't know if this is an exact quotation from a religious document, it is just something I have heard) I have always been taught there is only one true God, and it is a major sin and disrespectful to him to think of yourself as a God. 

5th - This one may be a bit silly as well, but I have a moral issue with it - Why does the church have so much money (into the hundreds of billions of dollars) I just have issues with understanding why a church, which is a tax free organization, holds onto more liquid cash than Apple. What do they do with it? I looked into this, and though they do help people in some circumstances, they could do so much more with the amount they hold. 

 Thank you all. I really do hope for answers and peace of mind. I truly strive to understand the things that I do not understand, and reading through this subreddit, I know some very knowledgeable people can give me the answers I seek.

My boyfriend (31m) and I (32f) are moving in May and need to make a decision asap about where we’re going. We currently live in a tiny ski town in VT and are originally from New England. Where we live now is way too small and is a winter tourist destination which comes with a lot of stress and it’s very hard to make friends. There’s no gym, there’s one bar, no coffee shops, bad food. We’re looking for a small city with access to nature. My boyfriend needs mountains to snowboard and I need forests with swimmable fresh water. Ideally on or near a coast but not necessarily a deal breaker. We love exploring the outdoors, good restaurants, live music, museums, friendly leftist artistic community- basically what everyone wants. I’m not a city dog but I do crave more to do than where we are now. We’re not rich at all- my boyfriend is a bartender trying to get into videography, I’m also a bartender/server but have years of experience in event management as well as landscaping/farming so COL is something we’re thinking about.

We’re looking at Olympia, Tacoma, Bellingham, Portland, Asheville, and Burlington. We’re not extremely career driven right now- our goal is to have a fun life experience and do something new and different together while hopefully making friends/building community. We are incredibly indecisive people and constantly change our mind on where we want to be. If anyone has ANY advice it would be greatly appreciated! ",8,1770841418.0,SameGrassButGreener,4,1.0,False
