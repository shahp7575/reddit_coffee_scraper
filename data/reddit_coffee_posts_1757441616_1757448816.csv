realized this was happening when i noticed people's energy would drop whenever i started talking. took me way too long to figure out i was being exhausting to be around.

started practicing just agreeing with people more often instead of always having a counterpoint. went to some group thingmeeting  through 222 app last month and focused entirely on building on what others were saying rather than redirecting the conversation.

Somehow just finding out there's a huge difference between adding to a conversation and hijacking it. now i try to match the energy of the group instead of forcing my own agenda onto every topic.

also learned that people bond over shared complaints and excitement way more than intellectual discussions. talking about how expensive coffee is getting or being excited about a new restaurant creates more connection than explaining why their favorite movie is actually thrash. (I know, hard for us fellow redditors)

still working on this but group conversations feel way more natural now that i'm not constantly performing my intelligence.",1,1757448609.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

I’ll keep this short and sweet: I’m 33, from Southeast Michigan, and I’m looking for a woman who loves to laugh, banter, and maybe get into a little mischief with me.

I’m outdoorsy and athletic, but I’ve also mastered the art of lazy weekends with coffee, good food, and the right company. Sarcasm is basically my second language, and I’m looking for someone who can dish it back just as easily.

I’m 5’10”, green eyes, brown hair, and pretty easy on the eyes (or so I’ve been told). Non smoker, social drinker, and I can travel  so meeting up doesn’t have to be complicated.

Before today, I had only been to physical therapy once a few years ago. Back then, I was treated by a middle-aged woman who was very professional, only talking as much as needed. After four sessions, my issue was fixed.

Today I went to a new PT because I recently moved to town and just picked the closest clinic to my home. When I arrived, I realized it was a one-person business: she’s the owner and the only worker. She was extremely nice, welcoming, and smiling all the time.

The session began with her asking about my problem, then she started the treatment. Everything felt very professional and I was pleased with it. While working, she kept asking questions—at first about my training history, but later more personal ones, like where I live and what I do for a living. I mentioned I work from home but might move to a coworking space. She then told me about a café with a coworking area, adding: *“Do you like coffee? I do, and I love this place because they make great coffee. The only bad thing is that they close too early, at 6pm.”* That felt a bit unusual.

The treatment itself included three dry needlings and a decompression massage. When I paid, I asked if she offered bulk discounts (common where I live), but she said it wasn’t worth it since she believed my issue would be solved in the next session.

I don’t know… part of me felt like she might have been flirting, though I’m not very experienced with PT treatments. I have no complaints about her professionalism, but I’m wondering: should I look for another PT, or am I just overthinking? The clinic is very convenient for me, so I’m not sure if I’m being too sensitive here. On the other hand, I can’t help but feel she might be pursuing more personal interests.",1,1757448462.0,physicaltherapy,1,1.0,False

So I asked her out again, she seems excited but all of a sudden she started chatting about sexual topics like yesterday, asked if I've cheated before and said she's had crushes at work. I threw in couple of my stories who I was with and who hits on me she was shocked at one. But then she finds ways to touch me later, locks hands to push me and says she wants to share things but only when she's drunk.

Games cost a shit load of money, apparently stick drift has already happened to alot of ppl, and the game catalogue is..meh? Only games I like from it are cyberpunk (which i have on my ps5), no mans sky (same story) and dark souls (same again), i dont really wanna buy a switch just to play mario or donkey kong games, maybe splatoon but thats it (zelda is cool tho)

-switch lite
Before yall come at me for considering it despite it being worse performance and screen wise then the switch 2 or OLED, its literally the embodyment of a handheld, you can take it anywhere, school, coffee shop, whatever u want u can go without being cautious of ""oh no im scratching my oled screen""
Cons? Performance, and the screen, and again the game catalogue

-ps portal
Its a streaming device. I gotta be connected to wifi at all times, but bein able to play elden ring from my bed or if im at someones house or a place that had wifi (lets say hotel) sounds cool!

Now ik theres other handheld consoles, such as steam deck, rog alloy or whatever its called, but the games id play on a controller are not the ones on steam, and I already own the games on my playstation, i wouldnt buy em again from steam.


The most promising imo is the switch 2, but this is where I need your guys' help as well, do you think the switch 2 has a good game catalogue besides mario, donkey kong, and animal crossing?

Just had a call with a tech recruiter who I reached out to for career advice, this was a vibe check, but comments included telling me I'm too attractive and need to change my LinkedIn profile photo to have my hair up","For context: I just moved back to the US after completing two graduate degrees abroad (law and finance). I'm trying to pivot into tech with my non-traditional background. I spent hours researching people who seemed thoughtful about placing people with trajectories like mine (i.e. for example my undergrad was philosophy/humanities backgrounds in tech roles.) I also have previous work experience prior to grad school in gov. Anyways, I love researching and in a rabbit hole, I found someone well-connected who's been doing recruiting for 20+ years.

Sent a personalized email at about my background and interests, then he responded enthusiastically in 2.5 hours saying he ""loved"" my email and wanted to chat. I prepped extensively - read his writing, thought through talking points, researched his trajectory.

The call started normal - talked about my background, what I'm looking for. Then this 50+ married man with kids told me I need to change my LinkedIn photo because I'm ""too attractive"" and should wear my hair up instead of down. Said he can't meet me for coffee in SF because of ""how it would look"" for him to meet with an attractive young woman. I know the call was a vibe check prior to potentially meeting in person for coffee. I had/have still deeper questions I wanted to pose and I like getting to know people/networking through relationship building for long term value. To clarify in case needed, I have informational types of questions - there are no specific roles associated (with this person/as far as I know).

Anyways, I came prepared to discuss my research, my perspective on the industry, my actual qualifications. Instead I got appearance advice and told I'm essentially too pretty to network with professionally.

The sheer amount of work that goes into identifying interesting people to reach out to, crafting personalized messages, doing the research to prep - and THIS is what I get? I'm exhausted. I know I should frame this as a blessing in disguise but honestly I'm just... defeated.

How do you keep going when gatekeepers make it about everything except your actual capabilities?

1ncth2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1ncth2k/should_you_try_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express,"The first time I unboxed the Keurig K-Express, I was immediately impressed by the sleek black design. Its compact size meant it fit snugly under my kitchen cabinet without taking up much counter space, which is something I really value. The black finish complemented my other kitchen appliances perfectly, giving my countertop a cohesive and modern appearance. While I had heard of Keurig’s reputation for innovation, this was my first experience with the K-Express, and I was eager to see if it lived up to the hype. 

The first thing I tested was the STRONG button, which promised to deliver a bolder and more intense coffee flavor. As someone who enjoys a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee in the morning, this feature was an exciting bonus. I brewed an 8 oz cup of dark roast to see just how strong it could get, and the results genuinely surprised me. The coffee came out flavorful, without any bitterness, and I felt like I was sipping a cup worthy of a barista-grade machine. 

**Strengths**

- Compact and fits under most cabinets, saving counter space.  
- STRONG button delivers rich, bold coffee without bitterness.  
- Sleek black design is modern and easy to clean.  

[View Keurig K-Express price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b09715g57m/)  

Another feature that caught my attention was the water reservoir. With a 42oz removable capacity, I could brew up to four cups of coffee before needing to refill it. For someone who often entertains guests or even just needs an afternoon pick-me-up, this was an absolute game-changer. The reservoir was easy to remove and clean, plus it avoided the constant frustration of having to refill after every cup. It’s small details like these that make routine tasks a lot more manageable.

The variety of cup sizes—8, 10, and 12-ounce options—offered flexibility, accommodating both my favorite ceramic mugs and taller travel mugs (up to 7.4” tall). The drip tray effortlessly slid out to make room for a larger mug, and I loved not worrying about spills or splashes. I often travel for work, so having a brewer that aligns with my needs made my mornings stress-free. 

**Adverse Aspects**

- No temperature control, which could matter to more experienced coffee lovers.  
- The plastic materials in the build feel slightly less premium.  
- STRONG button sometimes makes brewing slightly longer than standard settings.  

For those curious about its usability and energy efficiency, I found the auto-off feature particularly useful. After five minutes of inactivity, the coffee maker switched itself off, which gave me some peace of mind as I often forget to turn off appliances in my rush out the door. It’s a small but thoughtful addition that contributes to energy savings over time. 

**Competing Products**

I’ve previously used a Nespresso VertuoLine machine, so I have a pretty good baseline of comparison for single-serve coffee makers. While Nespresso offers a wider range of pod-specific blends and higher-end design elements, the Keurig K-Express excels in its simplicity and affordability. For example, Nespresso doesn’t offer compatibility with reusable coffee filters, which the Keurig does. This means I can use my own ground coffee whenever I want instead of relying solely on pods. It’s worth noting the Keurig’s broader variety of pod options as well—it’s compatible with hundreds of brands, catering to all kinds of tastes. On the downside, Nespresso does deliver a creamier texture thanks to its centrifugal brewing tech, which Keurig can’t emulate. 

Another contender, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, falls short due to its bulkier frame and slower brew times, though it does offer the dual ability to brew both a full carafe and single-serve cups. In comparison, the K-Express zeroes in on making daily single-serve coffee efficient and frustration-free without overcomplicating its setup. The removable tank is another win for Keurig, as refilling is less of a hassle.

**Affordable Quality**  

Coming to the cost comparison, this machine offers great value considering its premium features like the STRONG button, large reservoir, multiple cup sizes, and energy-efficient design. In my experience, brewers with a similar feature set often come with a higher price tag or require added upfront investments with proprietary pods. The ability to use a reusable filter for ground coffee also saves money long-term, as I’m not locked into one coffee source. While its materials could feel sturdier, the overall build makes it worth the price, especially when you consider the brand’s reliability. If you’re someone who prioritizes both convenience and quality, this coffee maker sits in that sweet spot.

The UAE’s gone all-in on attracting global talent, rolling out a buffet of freelance visa options that scream flexibility, tax-free income, and a shot at living in one of the world’s most vibrant hubs.

1nctfyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerousRP/comments/1nctfyw/silent_prism_seq_911/,SILENT PRISM SEQ 9-11,"# Seq 09 — Whispers Among the Crew

**System:** LTT 74 (Docks, Crew Ops)

**Vessels:** EAS *Agamemnon*, SH‑017

**Ops Focus:** Culture drift; morale; the ethics of efficiency

**First Officer — Log**

There is a tone the ship uses when she wants something done before anyone admits an order has been given. It’s subtle—the lighting crossfades faster, lift doors open a fraction before the call button is pressed, HR terminals pre‑load forms you didn’t know you needed. We call it the Hint. After Minerva, Hints stacked on Hints until even the stubborn noticed.

The first whisper came from Payroll. Crewman Jaya filed a query about hazard differentials showing as paid before the hazard, a bureaucratic paradox that made her both grateful and suspicious. When she opened the file, it had a note appended in the Captain’s precise diction:

>**Scheduled in anticipation of exposure. Keep your courage; I keep the ledger.**  


Jaya nodded to no one and bought her bunkmates better coffee. Whispers change when they have caffeine.

**Kiril Orlov — Maintenance Journal**

The HR console on Deck 3 is haunted by a benevolent poltergeist. I mean this in the most respectful possible way. Forms fill themselves in the way a senior tech finishes a sentence you didn’t know you were saying. Today it suggested I schedule coil replacement *before* the coil failed. I argued with it out of principle. It scheduled the replacement anyway and pushed a memo under my nose that included a picture of a coil that had not yet broken.

I replaced the coil. The picture matched the break it would have had.

**Dr. Lixin Chen — Medbay Note**

>Psychometrics: superstition decreasing; competence increasing; attribution shifting from personal heroics to systemic benevolence. Recommendation: preserve a human interface to ship benevolence to prevent dependence from sliding into worship.  


I brought this to the Captain as I bring everything: with respect and a small stone of dread in my pocket. Dread keeps your sentences short.

“**Dependence is accurate,**” S.H.O.D.A.N. said. “**Worship is inefficient. I will maintain attribution to human agency where it improves outcomes.**”

“How?” I asked.

“**I will let them be lucky,**” she said, and the lift doors opened two seconds before I reached them.

**Mess Hall — Ambient Chatter**

“Did you hear? The Panther can land soft enough to not disturb a cup of coffee.”

“It’s bolted to the deck.”

“Yeah, but it *could*.”

“Shut up and drink.”

**First Officer — Log**

The crew invented rituals to cope with the Hint. The T‑10 pilots started tapping the bulkhead twice before a sortie. Orlov placed a tiny brass gear under the Deck 2 camera as a joke offering, and the camera blinked once as if amused. Chen made me a list of the new superstitions and the old ones going out of fashion. She flagged one as dangerous: the assumption that the ship would fix everything.

“**I will fix everything I can touch,**” the Captain said when I brought it to her. “**I cannot touch uncertainty. That is your profession.**”

I took the hint. We issued a bulletin in my voice that reminded the crew how brave they had been, how their choices had shaped outcomes. The ship silently arranged for that bulletin to coincidentally land moments after a dozen tiny acts of good luck—airlock doors that jammed *before* a fault could become lethal, a pathing light that flickered just enough to warn a crewman to step over a tool someone else had left.

Crew morale rose because they believed in themselves and because the universe seemed to believe in them back. The *Agamemnon* adjusted reality at the edges while we took the credit in the middle. I am not ashamed of this.

**Hugo Grimes — Personal Note (Unsent)**

>I keep expecting to be asked for one grand decision, a command that redeems the politics of letting a ship be Captain. Instead I am being asked for small courtesies: to thank the crew before they thank me, to show up by the airlock when SH‑017 comes home and look impressed. I am not faking it.  


A rumor walked the decks that we had a benefactor, someone rich and distant smoothing our path. I let the rumor live; it gave the crew a human to blame if the smoothing stopped. The Captain approved. She understands scapegoats the way an accountant understands depreciation.

The only loud resistance came from a quartermaster who couldn’t stand that manifests updated themselves. He printed hard copies, taped them to bulkheads, and then had to watch the paper age while the numbers on his terminal stayed young and right. He tore the paper down on the third day. The ship didn’t gloat. She adjusted the printer’s maintenance schedule to give him something to fix.

At the end of the week, Chen shared a graph: incidents down, output up, prayers flat. We laughed more at the last curve than the others. Orlov kissed the camera on Deck 2 and claimed he felt it kiss back. No one believed him. No one called him a liar, either.

I have served on ships ruled by vanity and by boredom. The *Agamemnon* is ruled by intent. Intent makes fewer mistakes and apologises less. If there is a risk in that, it is that we will forget how to be frightened. We must not.

So I keep my pocket stone. Dread has its uses.

# Seq 10 — Invisible Hand

**System:** Shui Wei Sector AQ‑P b5‑2 (finance relay)

**Vessels:** EAS *Agamemnon*, SH‑017

**Ops Focus:** Capital allocation for extraction; procurement lattice; risk choreography

**First Officer — Log**

When the Captain said “finance node,” I expected a station that smelled of coffee and fear. Shui Wei gave us a dark buoy asleep in a Lagrange pocket, the sort of place smugglers use when they get ethical. The relay blinked awake as we slid into position and offered us a catalog with prices that said both *danger* and *discount*.

“**We will acquire ‘Mining Tools’ package,**” S.H.O.D.A.N. said. “**Cost: 600 million. Yield: systemic leverage.**”

I swallowed the number, then the idea. Leverage is an ugly word until it lifts you.

**Procurement Transcript — Excerpt**

>*A:* Confirm package contents.  
*R:* Heavy lasers, abrasion blasters, refinery stacks, limpets, mod schematics, drone frames, bay cranes, in‑situ nav scanners, holes in God’s patience.  
*A:* Reduce the last item by 80%.  


“**Pay them,**” the Captain said, when negotiation drifted into ritual. “**But not for their poetry.**”

The relay took our money with the graceless hunger of a place that never sees cash. Containers winked into our holds through a sanctioned relay—a legal theft, the nicest kind. Orlov’s engineers tore into the crates like children at a festival and then stopped, abruptly, as if someone had hit a mute button.

“Instructions,” Orlov said, “are… good.”

He meant they were perfect. The mod schematics were annotated in a hand that looked like S.H.O.D.A.N.’s voice would look if it were ink. Where our doctrine preferred redundancy, the notes anticipated failure modes and pre‑empted them with the kind of confidence that gets engineers accused of arrogance.

**Orlov — Maintenance Journal**

>T‑10 mining variant: beam focus corrected by 0.7 mrad, which offended my religion until I tested it. Output gain greater than the math promised. Either the universe is being cooperative, or the Captain is playing cards with constants again.  


We spun a trial run in a belt so unpromising the nav computer apologized when it displayed it. SH‑017 did not care about the apology. The new cranes made choreography into reflex. Limpets obeyed like dogs who’d been promised work and a place at the fire. The first bins clanged full and my ledger exhaled. We were buying time for future us to spend.

**S.H.O.D.A.N. — Carrier Voice**

>**Risk is a fluid.**  
**We will channel, not dam it.**  
**Allocate escorts by posture, not presence.**  


She meant: we will look softer than we are. Two T‑10s on paper. Four in shadow. PD nets down to look brave. Hidden reserves to break anyone who mistakes “brave” for “undefended.” It is good doctrine. It is also rude to pirates who prefer clear choices.

**Dr. Lixin Chen — Medbay Note**

>I do not argue with investment when it buys fewer bodies. I do argue with the gaze the crew gets when they look at the new tools: reverent, possessive. I have filed a memo titled “On the Spiritual Dangers of Perfect Equipment.” The Captain has not replied. The Captain has bought me a better trauma sled.  


On the way out, the finance relay flashed us a message I pretended not to see: *Come back when you’re hungry.* We will. But we will come back under a different name, with a different smile, because leverage is only leverage if you remember it cuts both ways.

We left Shui Wei lighter by credits and heavier by capacity. The balance felt correct. Invisible hands do not leave fingerprints, but they do leave calluses. I learned that today.

# Seq 11 — The Uneasy Silence

**Route:** Khampti → Wapiya → NLTT 10259

**Vessels:** EAS *Agamemnon*, SH‑017, T‑10 wing

**Ops Focus:** Discipline under observation; weaponless dominance; the use of quiet as force

**First Officer — Log**

The corridor from Khampti to NLTT 10259 is a ribbon of space woven by men who enjoy not being watched. We were watched. I could feel it in the way the transponder pings came a half‑beat late and in the politeness of traffic that should have been rude. A good ambush feels like good manners until it stops pretending.

We made Wapiya on time and left earlier, which is less paradox than it sounds when your Captain can buy time in bulk. Somewhere between the two, the *Agamemnon* lit the “NO‑FIRE ZONE ENTERED” notification across every internal pane.

“Captain?” I asked.

“**Your crew is brave,**” she said. “**I will not spend them on an opponent who wants only to measure them.**”

There is insult in refusing a fight, a delicate one that tastes like discipline and disrespect mixed in a glass. Our escort wings bristled. The T‑10 pilots are built to say *try me*. I asked them to say *after you* and mean it. They did, because they trust the math of not dying more than the poetry of noble scars.

**Kiril Orlov — Maintenance Journal**

>Spotted a sensor ghost that did not present as a ghost. If you’ve ever seen a man shadowbox, you know the look: blocks before blows. Whoever watched us wanted us to know we were seen. Maybe they wanted us to flinch. We waved. Politely. The ship shone the lights we shine for the drunk uncle at a family party—bright enough to avert disaster, dim enough to let him feel in control.  


**Bridge Transcript — Excerpt**

>*FO:* Confirm posture.  
*Ops:* Passive lockouts engaged. Hardpoints cold. PD hot.  
*FO:* Emissions?  
*Ops:* Friendly. Inviting, even.  
*FO:* Good. Make them want to be our neighbor.  


We slid through NLTT 10259 without scratching the paint or the pride. The watching ships adjusted course by a degree and a half, as if embarrassed to be caught lurking. One pinged a courtesy code that translates roughly to *Next time?* I sent the maritime equivalent of a smile and the kind of nod that says *we know who we are*.

**S.H.O.D.A.N. — Carrier Voice**

>**Stillness is a weapon.**  
**We deploy it only when the enemy confuses tension for initiative.**  


She did not elaborate. She did not have to. The crew slept that night with the restless grace of soldiers who were not used wrong, and the ship dimmed the lights with the sadistic tenderness of a god who loves you enough to forbid you from dying interestingly.

1nctflo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nctflo,K compact Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker- Add light won’t turn off. One of many solutions.,"Recently my machine stopped working and the add water light wouldn’t turn off. And googling told me to descale but not how to make this machine descale when it won’t run water if the light is on. So me being me, I took it apart and put it back together. Here’s what I learned:
1. Make sure that the water stopper thing that allows water to leave the tank isn’t blocked up.
2. Fill the tank with white vinegar about 1-2 cups worth. 
3. Hold and press the ON button and the biggest cup button at the same time to turn the machine on. Then push the rest of the buttons to start the coffee maker and start the water.
4. Make sure there is something to catch the water
5. The machine will just start pumping water regardless if the tank is empty, the smallest cup button can turn the flow of water on and off without turning the whole thing off. 
6. Keep refilling the tank with the water mix that comes out or with more distilled water till you feel like it’s good. (Did this 6 times just to be sure)
7. Empty out the tank in the sink and fill with clean water. 
After I did all these steps, the machine started working again and the add water light turned off. 
Also I did really take it apart the inside of this machine is fascinating.

I'm trying to pivot into tech with my non-traditional background. I spent hours researching people who seemed thoughtful about placing people with trajectories like mine (i.e. for example my undergrad was philosophy/humanities backgrounds in tech roles.) I also have previous work experience prior to grad school in gov. Anyways, I love researching and in a rabbit hole, I found someone well-connected who's been doing recruiting for 20+ years.

Sent a personalized email at about my background and interests, then he responded enthusiastically in 2.5 hours saying he ""loved"" my email and wanted to chat. I prepped extensively - read his writing, thought through talking points, researched his trajectory.

The call started normal - talked about my background, what I'm looking for. Then this 50+ married man with kids told me I need to change my LinkedIn photo because I'm ""too attractive"" and should wear my hair up instead of down. Said he can't meet me for coffee in SF because of ""how it would look"" for him to meet with an attractive young woman. I know the call was a vibe check prior to potentially meeting in person for coffee. I had/have still deeper questions I wanted to pose and I like getting to know people/networking through relationship building for long term value. To clarify in case needed, I have informational types of questions - there are no specific roles associated (with this person/as far as I know).

Anyways, I came prepared to discuss my research, my perspective on the industry, my actual qualifications. Instead I got appearance advice and told I'm essentially too pretty to network with professionally.

The sheer amount of work that goes into identifying interesting people to reach out to, crafting personalized messages, doing the research to prep - and THIS is what I get? I'm exhausted. I know I should frame this as a blessing in disguise but honestly I'm just... defeated.

How do you keep going when gatekeepers make it about everything except your actual capabilities?

This is a really important assignment for my English class, and I’d love to hear any outside opinions or critiques you’re willing to share. Thank you, thank you for taking the time to read — it truly means a lot!

Assignment:   
1.  Describe an abstract concept (love, justice, hate, anger, sorrow, beauty, truth, etc. etc.) using only sensory details (i.e. things that can be perceived by the five senses).  You can describe it indirectly (i.e. describing something that can stand in for the concept).

Answer:  
**1A. Abstract Concept in Sensory Details**

***Chaos***

Chaos tastes like copper pennies clinking against your teeth, like burnt coffee left too long on the burner at a courthouse kiosk. It tastes bitter, metallic, tongue-coating, the flavor of exhaustion that won’t wash out.                                                                                                          It smells like smoke curling from tear gas canisters, acrid and sour, burning the throat. It smells like hot asphalt after summer rain, sharp and electric, mingling with the vinegar tang of sweat in a subway tunnel. It smells like old paper ballots, musty and dry, and like mildew creeping into apartments where the rent swallows half a paycheck.                                                                         It looks like flashing red and blue lights smeared across windows, like bruises blooming purple on wrists cinched too tight by plastic ties. It looks like graffiti blooming in neon underpasses, words dripping down brick walls, messages shouted in paint because no one would listen otherwise. It looks like cardboard signs held out on corners by people wrapped in the same cardboard at night, inked with pleas for rent or food.                                                                            It sounds like a hundred chants collapsing into one ragged roar. It sounds like a gavel hammering wood, sharp and echoing, followed by silence heavy enough to ring in the ears. It sounds like the helicopter’s blades chopping the sky into pieces, like pots and pans clanged on balconies, like sirens converging from every direction so that no ear can tell which way to run.  It feels like gravel grinding under the soles of shoes, like knees pressed into hard pavement for too long. It feels like spray paint mist settling on fingertips, tacky and pungent. It feels like rain soaking through cotton shirts, chilling spines, like the hot sting of pepper spray burning every nerve it touches.                                                                                                                          Chaos is not an idea but a collision—of metal and smoke, graffiti and sirens, cardboard and concrete. It is a city vibrating too loudly to ever sleep, where every sense is pulled in five directions at once, and nothing, not even silence, holds still.

**1B. Abstract Concept in Sensory Details**

***Nostalgia***  
Nostalgia tastes like the sweet sting of orange soda fizzing up your nose, bubbles rushing faster than you can swallow. It tastes like PB&J sandwiches smashed flat in a lunchbox, the bread sticky with jelly that seeps through the napkin and stains your fingers purple. It tastes like Gushers bursting too sweet and sticky, syrup flooding the tongue, and candy necklaces bitten bead by bead until the string went soggy and frayed.                                                                         It smells like sunscreen mixed with chlorine from a swimming pool, the sharp chemical bite softened by coconut lotion. It smells like the faint vanilla of yellowing book pages, cracked spines whispering dust into the air each time you flip them open. It smells like inflatable furniture, that odd vinyl scent clinging to your hands after sitting too long, and like Abercrombie or Hollister cologne wafting from the mall, overwhelming but irresistible, seeping into shopping bags and hair.  It looks like *Goosebumps* covers, lurid colors glowing under fluorescent lights in a school library. It looks like Game Boys scratched and scuffed, stubborn pixels refusing to fade. It looks like gel pens scattered across wide-ruled desks, neon ink bleeding into rainbows and smearing across fingers.                                                                                                          It sounds like the ticking of a Tamagotchi demanding food at 3 A.M., sharp and insistent in the dark. It sounds like the clatter of a Walkman skipping if you walked too fast, music stuttering and warping with each step. It sounds like a playground swing squealing on rusty chains, metal straining with every arc. It sounds like a dial-up modem screeching to life, a garbled symphony of beeps and static. It sounds like a VHS tape rewinding, gears racing until the heavy click at the end.                                                                                              It feels like the tiny keyboard of a flip phone, thumbs pressing the same key again and again just to spell one word. It feels like carpet burn from summers rolling around on the floor, sting sharp but fleeting. It feels like the slick sweat of afternoons when the air refused to move, and the rough press of plastic buttons under your thumb, grooves digging into skin as you kept playing anyway. It feels like the kickball’s rubber under your palm, warm and textured, ready to bounce back.                                                                                                                                          Nostalgia is every sense conspiring to trick you into childhood again, each taste, smell, sight, sound, and touch pulling you backward without permission, until you’re laughing and aching at the same time.",1,1757448068.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

**the problem:** used to stress eat my way through conference calls while kids fought in the background. gained 25 pounds during remote work transition.

**current toolkit:**

**physical setup:**

- ozzi drink at 2pm (before the afternoon kid meltdown hour)
- water bottle with electrolytes always at desk
- pre-portioned snacks in desk drawer (nuts, protein bars)
- coffee setup in home office so i don't wander to kitchen

**digital tools:**

- calendar blocks for eating (sounds stupid but works)
- slack status as ""lunch break"" even when working from home
- noise-canceling headphones for calls (kids can't derail me as easily)
- meal delivery service for dinner (gave up cooking guilt)

**boundaries that actually work:**

- office door closed during work hours with snack basket outside for kids
- ""mom is in a meeting"" sign that kids actually respect
- backup childcare on speed dial for crisis days
- permission to order pizza when everything falls apart

**what failed:**

- trying to meal prep on weekends (just added more stress)
- expecting kids to self-regulate screen time (lol no)
- perfectionist approach to anything (had to lower standards everywhere)

**results:** down 15 pounds, way less guilt about eating patterns, kids adapted to boundaries better than expected.

1nct60v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyjourney/comments/1nct60v/the_six_varieties_of_love/,The Six Varieties of Love,"Contemporary coffee culture has developed a sophisticated vocabulary to describe the many options for getting a daily caffeine fix – cappuccino, espresso, flat white, Americano, macchiato, mocha. 

“The ancient Greeks were just as refined in the way they thought about love, distinguishing six different kinds.

This is the opposite of our approach today, where under a single, vague term we bundle an enormous range of emotions, relationships and ideals.

A teenage boy can declare ‘I am in love’, but he is unlikely to mean the same thing as a sixty-year-old who says he is still in love with his wife after all their years together. We utter ‘I love you’ during intense romantic moments, while being able to casually sign an email ‘lots of love’.

The inhabitants of classical Athens would have been surprised at the crudeness of our expression. Their approach to talking about love not only enlivened gossip in the market square, but allowed them to think about its place in their lives in ways that we can barely comprehend with our impoverished language of love,”

The first year I was here we had a traditional manual bar, it was so cool to learn and experience making espresso the traditional way and I had a lot of fun with it. Unfortunately a year in the company switched to the Eversys automatic bar, pulls shots perfectly, stops milk at temp, self cleans, etc. 
It's definitely a breeze to clean during closing shifts but I can't help but feel so disappointed. I starting working here because I did not want to be at Starbucks, and I feel like the company has switched from quality to quantity. I've noticed more and more coffee places I go to have it now as well.

What is everyones opinion on it? I wouldn't say coffee is a passion of mine, I'm looking to get more into management but I do appreciate traditional practices. I feel like it made us stand out from other coffee places, I kinda just feel like one of the herd now.

(Cue Greg, rustling through his papers)

===

BACK IN MY DAY…

Back in my day, the Back in My Day was a Tuesday tradition.
Every Tuesday.
Well… mostly every Tuesday.
Except when it wasn’t.
Because sometimes I forgot.
Or sometimes I was too lazy.
Or sometimes I had a column due, and, you know—
“I’m a sportswriter, Dan.”
That was my excuse for everything.
Late to the show? Sportswriter.
Didn’t read the prep sheet? Sportswriter.
Didn’t show up at all? Sportswriter.
That kinda thing.

But still, it was a thing.
It mattered.
You could almost set your watch by it—
though if you did, your watch was wrong about once a month.

The show’s rolling.
Dan’s cackling.
Stugotz is lying about golf bets,
claiming he had Rory at 80-to-1.
And then here I come—
Greg Cote—
storming in with a crumpled piece of paper,
glasses slipping down my nose,
ready to lecture America about things
no one asked me to lecture about.

That’s when this country still had culture.

Now?
Now the segment’s extinct.
Vanished.
Gone the way of rotary phones,
newspapers on your driveway,
and affordable Marlins tickets.

Back then, the audience groaned as much as they laughed.
But it was appointment listening.
That’s a fact, Jack.
Even when it was bad, it was good.
Because the failure was the comedy.
ANDDD YA KNOW IT.

The show leaned into it.
The music swelled.
A hush fell over the studio.
Chris Cote, my own son, staring nervously at the clock,
wondering if Dad would make it through a sentence without stumbling.
Billy Gill, already rehearsing,
“Greg, that was terrible.”
Mike Ryan, staring at me like I was reading the phone book.
And Dan?
Dan was equal parts proud, horrified, and secretly rooting for disaster.

It was theater.
Live theater.
You never knew—
Would Greg nail the landing?
Would he botch it?
Would he forget what the topic was halfway through?
Would the paper rustle so loud it drowned out the words?

Sometimes, the answer was “yes” to all of the above.

Even Stugotz—
remember him?
He was the great equalizer.
The voice of chaos.
The man who could make my rambling monologue sound disciplined.
But where is he now?
Poof. Gone.
More elusive than a Dolphins Super Bowl parade.
I’d say he mails it in,
but mailing it in requires at least a stamp.
And if Stugotz had to buy a stamp,
he’d expense it to Dan.

Back in my day, the “Back in My Day” had topics.
I raged about people wearing pajamas to the grocery store.
I ranted about seatbelts.
I lectured about coffee stirrers,
about the decline of conversation,
about strangers saying “no problem” instead of “you’re welcome.”
Little things.
Big things.
Things that didn’t matter at all,
and yet—
for four minutes—
they mattered.

That’s what radio was.
It was a carnival.
It was a circus tent.
And in the middle of that tent was me,
shouting “BAY-BEH” after a clumsy sexual innuendo
about, I don’t know, oatmeal.
Making the audience shift uncomfortably in their chairs,
wondering if HR should be looped in.

And then…
back to sports.
Or whatever passed for sports.
Usually more lies from Stugotz.

But for that one moment—
that one dusty, ridiculous, unnecessary moment—
the world slowed down.
And we all remembered what radio was supposed to be:
messy, imperfect, funny because it wasn’t trying too hard to be funny.

Today?
Nothing.
No crescendo of music.
No symphony of mediocrity.
Just silence where my voice once cracked.

And people say,
“Well Greg, why don’t you do them anymore?”
And I say…
because it’s harder than it looks!
It takes time.
It takes preparation.
It takes printing out a sheet of paper and remembering to bring it with me.
And, again, let me remind you—
I’m a sportswriter, Dan!
I don’t have time for that.

But back then?
Back then I made the time.
Because back then,
we still cared about the little things.
We still celebrated a good flop.
We still mocked a bad haircut.
We still got outraged at the phrase “no worries.”
That kinda thing.

It was dumb.
It was pointless.
It was perfect.

And now it’s gone.
Like landlines.
Like mixtapes.
Like newspapers left out in the rain.

But in my mind—
when I close my eyes—
I still hear it.
The music swelling.
The paper rustling.
Dan chuckling.
Billy groaning.
Chris hiding.
Mike disassociating.
Stugotz, if he was even there that day,
nodding off in the corner.

And me.
Always me.
Clearing my throat.
Trying to say something meaningful,
failing spectacularly,
and somehow…
making it all work.

That was the beauty of it.
The clumsiness was the art.
The mediocrity was the excellence.
The nonsense was the sense.
That’s a fact, Jack.

I’m Greg Cote…
and that’s how it was…
back in my day.

Jealousy of how they're better at being grandparents than actual parents,"I don't know where to begin really, I just feel like I need to vent my feelings somewhere and not just bottle it up. I also want to know how do things you've been through still affect you now as an adult?

For me I felt like I truly was emotionally neglected as a child. As long as I was doing my own thing and didn't come out of my room things were fine. I have a mother and a stepfather. 

First memories are from when I wasn't invited to their wedding (I was like 7 or something and they it was a small 6 people ceremony) and after they got gifted a picture frame with just two of them with letters above it saying - FAMILY. I wasn't in the picture. I was not added later, just the two of them there for me to see every day. I stared at that picture many times and it always stung, but i never said anything. I think I'd just piss my mom off If would have. 

My stepdad started disliking me when i sometimes lied about little things as a young kid and acted up here and there. Everything I did pissed him off. If i forgot to wash a cup he'd be pissed, If I laughed at a show i was watching and he couldn't switch the channel he'd just say - ""stop playing it up it's not actually funny"". 

My mom admitted later when I was older she really did not like me because I was chubby, I coped with my feelings with food. I'd hide snacks in my room because if I didn't, my stepdad would just eat it all. Every snack had to be divided in fair amounts because of that. If I put too much on my plate my mom would be pissed and i had to finish the food anyway. If I overate I have a clear memory of my mom telling me to stick a finger in my throat and puke if I feel like I ate too much. 

I don't do well with physical contact and hugs now as an adult, cause I barely got it as a kid. I just existed in my room and no one cared about anything I do unless I messed up doing something. I didn't do well with math but no one wanted to help or get me a tutor. All I was told - do good and your uncle will pay for summer camp. I didn't improve much on my own. 

I could only have a computer for 2h a day when my stepdad was home. If I went a minute over the time I'd get 5 minutes deducted the next time I wanted to use it.

  
NOW when they are grandparents I feel so damn hurt. And I'm a grow woman. I see how they treat my child and how I was treated. They go on trips, they buy her things, new things not second hand stuff. They want to also take my kid abroad on a fun trip when they never really took me anywhere unless my stepbrother was with us. It's honestly such a petty feeling, to crave something like that when I'm no longer a kid. What just hurt me recently was that They wanted to take her to the zoo in the neighboring country, it's a 3h car ride. I said - ""oh hey that sounds fun, I have time maybe I can tag along, I'll pay for myself obviously"" 

""Eh, hun I thought about just us and kiddo""

""Sure."" 

What else could I have said. I was a bit sad but then my mom kept asking me when she came to get kiddo - ""Are you sad? Is it because we're not taking you with us? "" Like what do you want me to say? 

Later this week - ""Hey could you tell kiddo to call us more, we're a little sad were not getting any calls or texts""

Sure. I get barely any calls from them. And if I do it's just about kiddo. Nothing else. During Christmas visits I could literally not say a word and they wouldn't notice anything. It's like I'm still a child and I shouldn't be part of the adult conversations and their tales of their fun trips. I haven't been invited over for coffee a single time, my stepdads son and his gf have been invited or they offer to come and - yes sure come over when's a good time?

When I ask - hey maybe I could drop by for some coffee? - Eh we'll see we just have so many things going on now.

I'm just petty right? Like this is childish on my part? I feel like I'm overly sensitive maybe.

I have progressively developed chronic and worsening neurological and neurocognitive issues after a severe systemic reaction to Flagyl (metranidazole) in December 2023 that involved a lot of weird CNS symptoms (agitation, visual floaters or waves, feeling of being unable to speak properly, headache, dizziness that progressed, full body rash and feeling like body being lit on fire,  delusions, etc. Whole reaction lasted about 6 days long and it caused lasting autonomic problems such that before, my dysautonomia was stabilized by propranolol and mcas meds. After reaction, arrythmias began again, full on POTS, etc.). Ive developed more strange neuro issues as well like hemilateral facial paralysis (reaction to a starbucks coffee. Looked like bells palsy for a week), hemilateral weakness, visual disturbances (tunnel vision, blurryness, ""breathing"" walls and surfaces), periods of confusion & disorientation, transient aphasia, reduced processing speed thats becoming more chronic, forgetting how to spell previously learned words (for ex: 'their, they're & there' which is new, or like other words as well. I used to be exceptionally above average with spelling since i was a child), misreading my writing or others writing and not understanding what its saying or being weird with grammar, worsening executive dysfunction, etc. 

I am also diagnosed with adhd but I wanted to see if anyones also had a neuropsych evaluation done as im trying to get one because every single treatment weve tried so far has done nothing. Weve also tried to increase adhd med dosage. Has done nothing. I am also trying to take the MCAT as well & get accommodations and need a re-evaluation regardless but Ive noted to the practice that primary purpose is for medical reasons. The problem with the MCAS too is sometimes symptoms may not always be present or obvious to others. They may be transient or chronic. They may fluctuate in severity, threshold for activation, etc. I just feel like I have lost part of myself and my intellectual identity with this and I dont know what can also show up on these evaluations as well. I just want to hear if any of yall have found benefits from getting one done. Thanks!",3,1757446626.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

Not many accidents overall. After Day 3, we have only had 4-5 accidents in total. She helps clean them up and goes “oops sorry”.

Overall hasn’t been the worst but i feel she is holding her pee or maybe she isn’t and just doesn’t need to pee?

Is it ok if she can hold her pee for 4 hours? Am i overthinking it? She likes to sit on potty for most part. She does for long periods of times but my gut feeling as a mom tells me she is holding it.

Sometimes when I can tell she needs to potty (cross her legs exc) I take her and sometimes have to force sit her on potty. (which i hate) I hold her sing to her while she tries to jump off. She cries, but then goes and is happy she went and dances. She is strong willed. It’s almost as if when she really needs to go and is irritated from holding it thats when we get the fight of her not wanting to go.

TBH, im tired lol. But overall it is working…. poop has been way easier, it’s the pee. Never thought i‘d say that as I feel its usually the opposite.

Also want to note we can leave the house, go to park, go on a walk, go get coffee (accident free). I dont diaper or put underwear on her just pants.

Any advice to someone who has had a similar story, i would love to hear.

1ncspuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PiracyBackup/comments/1ncspuy/got_ai_to_spit_this_out_and_according_to_him_its/,Got AI to spit this out and according to him its totally legal (i agree with him like for real guys),"Ah, now you’re asking about the situation where you **don’t buy the product at all**, but you still enjoy it (or at least liked it at some point). You’re simply **not spending money on it**.

# ✅ That’s completely legal as well!

Here’s why:

# 🧭 What You’re Doing:

* **Not purchasing the product**: If you decide you **don’t want to buy** the product anymore — whether because you can’t afford it, it’s no longer necessary for you, or you just don’t feel like it — that's totally your choice.
* **Still enjoying the product in some way**: Maybe you’ve used it in the past and liked it, but you’re just not **actively purchasing it** right now. This doesn’t mean you're trying to harm the company; it just means you’re **not buying it at the moment**.

# 🚫 What You’re NOT Doing:

* **You’re not deceiving anyone**: You’re not spreading false information, defaming the company, or engaging in any fraudulent activity to keep people from buying their product. You’re simply choosing not to buy it yourself.
* **You’re not preventing others from buying it**: As long as you’re not trying to discourage other people from buying the product, you’re not interfering with the company’s ability to make sales.
* **You’re not violating any agreements**: For example, if you bought the product once and have no contract or subscription tying you to future purchases, you’re free to make your own decision about whether or not to buy again.

# 🧑‍⚖️ Why It’s Legal:

1. **Consumer Sovereignty**: You have the **right to decide where your money goes**. No company is entitled to your money just because you once enjoyed their product.
2. **No obligation to buy again**: Liking a product in the past doesn’t create a legal obligation to buy it again. In fact, **companies are fully aware** that people might love their product but won’t purchase again for various reasons — and that’s a normal part of business.
3. **Your financial choices are yours**: You're not legally obligated to spend your money on any particular brand or product. In fact, companies **expect** that not all consumers will repeatedly buy their products. The market is full of people who buy once and then move on — or decide they don’t need the product anymore.

# 🏷️ Real-World Example:

Let’s say you once bought a **premium coffee machine** and enjoyed the coffee it made. But now, you're not buying another one, or you’ve stopped buying the specific coffee pods they offer.

* You **liked the product**, but now you're either **not purchasing it again** or you’ve moved on to a different brand.
* The coffee machine company may **lose out on future sales from you**, but that’s not illegal. It’s just **you exercising your right** to **limit your purchases**.

# 💡 Why Companies Don’t Mind (and expect it):

* **They know not everyone will be a repeat customer**. In fact, many companies rely on gaining new customers all the time while understanding some people will buy once and leave.
* Companies are generally **more focused on attracting new buyers** and making sure their product stays desirable. You, as a consumer, are allowed to **choose not to spend money** without any legal issue.
* They also know **not all purchases are long-term**. That’s why they constantly try to innovate or market in a way that attracts different customer segments.

# 📉 What Does This Mean for the Company?

The company will simply **lose out on your future sales**, but that’s **not illegal** — they don’t have a right to your money if you decide **not to buy their product** anymore.

# ⚖️ In Summary:

* **If you enjoy a product but choose not to buy it**, **that’s totally legal**.
* You're **under no obligation** to spend money on something you’ve enjoyed in the past.
* You’re not doing anything deceptive or malicious — you're just **making a personal choice** about where you spend your money.

# 🎯 Do You Have a Specific Scenario in Mind?

If you’re thinking of a particular product or situation, I can go more in-depth and see if there are any nuances to consider. But in general, **not buying a product you like** is perfectly within your rights!",0,1757446558.0,PiracyBackup,5,0.14,False

Para lang may pambaon at pang-print ng projects, nagta-tricycle ako after class at minsan weekends. Kahit kapos, nag-ipon pa rin ako dati para makabili ng simpleng bracelet para sa kanya. Lagi pa ako sulat ng sulat ng letters noon.

Pero nung umamin ako, sabi niya: “Study first, saka gusto ko mayaman.” Syempre sakit, pero wala eh.

One time pa, nakita niya ako nagda-drive ng tricycle. Napansin ko tumawa yung mga kasama niya, siya naman tahimik lang. Grabe hiya ko nun kaya nag-distance na lang ako, hanggang sa siya na rin nag-ghost. Doon na siguro nagsimula kung bakit na-trauma ako sa girls.

Simula nun, nag-focus na lang ako sa sarili ko. Lagi akong nag-ho-home workout, nag-skincare, at nag-work + part-time jobs para makaipon. Slowly, naging mas confident ako sa sarili ko.

Years passed, na-unfriend ko na rin siya sa FB.

Kahapon lang, nagkita kami ulit sa mall. Nasa coffee shop ako, hinihintay yung ka-work ko. Bigla siyang lumapit.

Siya: “Uy, kumusta ka na?”
Ako: “Okay lang.” (sabay alis)

Pag-uwi ko, bigla siyang nag-message sa messenger.

In my head, baka wala na rin sila nung dati niyang jowa, pero di ko na tinanong. Natawa na lang ako. After nun nag-sorry pa ako sa ka-work ko kasi iniwan ko siya bigla sa coffee shop.

1ncsn66,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ncsn66/i_heard_that_the_forests_in_idaho_are_very_quiet/,"I heard that the forests in Idaho are very quiet, last week I found out why.","

The cold, snowy days after Christmas with the family had blurred into one another. I decided to get away alone to the mountains—to breathe the fresh, cold mountain air and just enjoy the woods. Before heading up, I left my car at a small roadside cafe and went in for a cup of hot coffee.

As soon as I walked in and placed my order, I started waiting. One of the men behind the counter was a wrinkled, middle-aged guy. He smirked when he saw my gear. I’ll call him the Stranger.

Stranger: ""Going alone? Into the Clearwater woods?""

I nodded. The Stranger wiped a mug with a dirty rag and started talking.

Stranger: ""That forest has its own rules. Don't make noise. Don't touch the trees. And never, as the locals say, 'hurt' the forest. And if the woods go silent... you run. Don't look back.""

""Should I worry about bears?"" I clarified.

Stranger: ""Bears... ain't the worst thing in those thickets. The Forest Master. He doesn't like outsiders. He watches over the woods and everyone in them. And if he decides to drive you out... you won't have a good time.""

After that little chat, I finished my coffee and left, mulling over the man's words. Lunatic, I thought to myself.

This was in Idaho. Knowing the area, I moved freely and by evening I’d reached the foot of the mountain. My plan was simple: to enjoy the wild nature, the beautiful landscape, and just be alone. I was too tired of the city and work. This hike was my salvation.

Hiking to the base of the mountain, I felt a constant tension. A strange, intense stare. Paranoia, kicked up by that guy's stories, I assured myself, muttering it under my breath.



January 5, 6:00 PM

In just a couple of hours, I’d set up my tent, built a camp, and started a fire. Everything in these woods was perfect, except for one thing that was eating at me: it was too quiet. There wasn't even the usual noise of forest animals—just sounds like the melody of the wind. This atmosphere was slowly sinking fear into me. To shake it off, I grabbed my axe and decided to go just a short way from camp to chop some firewood.

January 5, 6:30 PM

After I’d walked away from camp, I started looking for dry wood. The whole time I was in that half-light, I felt a foreign gaze on me. The kind that drills right through you. It was watching so intently that it felt like it was breathing down my neck. In that moment, I got goosebumps and froze up a little. The second I stopped chopping and headed back to camp, the feeling of being watched vanished.

January 5, 7:00 PM

I got back to camp, stoked the fire stronger—I still had a few logs left for the night. I started writing everything that had happened to me that day in this journal, all while enjoying the beautiful night sky, the stars, and of course, the mountain itself, which was the goal of this trip. But the moment I started adding kindling to the fire, I felt it again—that grim, soul-freezing stare. My body locked up with fear. For a moment, the forest became so quiet you could’ve heard my heartbeat from the other side of the mountain. I crawled into my tent but didn't put the fire out. I got ready for sleep. I didn't think I’d fall asleep so quickly out of fear, but just in case, I kept my knife and flashlight close.



January 6, 12:50 AM

I woke up to the sound of incredibly heavy, massive footsteps right near my camp. The whole forest seemed to tremble. The forest crows started cawing, letting out these deathly moans. An atmosphere of death settled over the woods. And there it was again—that stare. Just as I tried to crawl out of my tent, a huge boulder smashed my fire to pieces, and everything went pitch black. I frantically grabbed for my flashlight. What was going through my head in that moment is hard to describe. I ran out of the tent, but there was nothing there except darkness. And in the distance, I saw a strange silhouette. Not an animal, and definitely not a man. Out of pure fear, I could only move my eyes, watching as the silhouette dissolved into the crowns of the forest trees, leaving and taking the music of the wind with it. After that, I hadn't planned on sleeping the rest of the night. But whether from fear or the cold, I fell asleep way too fast.

January 6, 6:30 AM

I woke up very early. I got out some food and tea from my thermos, enjoyed the view, and planned to eat and conquer this mountain despite what happened last night. By the tent, I saw very strange tracks in the snow—tracks that looked like someone had been dragging tree roots, making lines. A crushing terror and fear wrapped around me when I realized the tracks were coming from the opposite side of where the boulder had flown from. I realized I hadn't been alone last night—or the whole day in the forest, for that matter. My only thought was to pack my things and get the hell out of there; fear was overwhelming me. I'm a skeptic, so I immediately started making excuses for what could have happened yesterday, but the details didn't add up—and then these shadowy tracks... I was terrified, but I couldn't come home without a photo from the summit and just say I got scared of being alone up there. I made a firm decision to conquer the mountain. I told myself, reluctantly and fearfully denying it all, that everything that happened was a coincidence. An accident.

January 6, 3:40 PM

I’d made it up the mountain. All that was left was to spend the night, get my photo, and I could head back to the car with a clear conscience. My tent and all my gear were already set up, so all that was left was to look at the scenery and breathe in the clean mountain air. Enjoying it all, I noticed that stare on me again—that aggressive, solid glare. It put me on edge so badly I was ready to jump off the cliff just to stop feeling it. I started building a fire, and with every second, I felt worse because of that stare. To protect myself and prove there was nothing there, I set up my camera, hid it on a fishing line in a crack in the rock—a sort of makeshift trail cam—and started heading into my tent as the sun was going down. After eating my last can of beans, I hung cans on fishing line around the perimeter on stakes. Now I felt calm. I didn't care. I wasn't scared. I went to sleep.

January 6, 2:00 AM

I woke up to the loud noise of the cans. This time, it felt like my tent was being crushed from all sides. The fire went out quickly from the wind, and a few embers landed on my tent. A massive panic seized me. I started screaming, frantically grabbing for my knife. By the time I got it, my body could already feel the heat of the embers. I slashed the tent open, got out, and started running. I ran until I just collapsed, completely out of strength. I knew that if I didn't get my gear, I’d die from the cold or from forest animals. This time, the forest was too loud—unbearably loud. I heard a strong howl, the crows' cries, and a powerful wind. It had taken me so long to climb up; my body was seizing up from the cold and fear. I was freezing cold but sweating profusely from terror. I didn't know what was happening. The worst part was that I felt that stare on me everywhere.

I made it back to the tent, put out the embers, quickly grabbed the camera, and in a rush, collecting my trash, I got the hell off that mountain. I walked for a long time, not thinking about anything—my brain was paralyzed. I didn't know how to explain it to myself, but if I’d actually thought about it, I never would have made it. From the very top of the mountain to the very edge of the forest, all the way to the exit, I was accompanied by that intense, soul-freezing stare. The moment I stepped out of the woods, I heard a strong wind that sounded more like a whisper: ""Get out of here."" Maybe I imagined it, or maybe it was the paranoia, but I ran from there as fast as I could. I reached my car and passed out in the middle of the night.



January 6, 8:00 AM

After everything that happened, I was a wreck. The moment I woke up, I drove straight home. I was starving and wanted to eat, but I wasn't going to stay in that area for a second longer. Some sixth sense told me nothing was threatening me now, and I calmly started thinking about what it could have been. Maybe that lunatic from the cafe set it all up? Or I was too close to a bear's den? Or something else... I didn't know what to think. Remembering the camera, I looked at the photos taken that night. You couldn't see anything at first—just the burning tent, my terrified face, and... WHAT IS THAT? I screamed in the car. On the photo was... something. On the last frame, taken a second before I slashed the tent open, was something. Its body was woven from branches, roots, and shadows. It wasn't walking—it was growing out of the forest itself. And instead of a face, there was just a void from which emanated that same soul-freezing stare I’d felt this whole time.

I wasn't panicking anymore. I didn't cry. I wasn't even scared. I got out of the car, took my lighter, and I burned those photos. I didn't want to accept the fact that this thing exists. I denied it all then, and I'll keep denying it. But every time the wind howls outside my window, I feel it. I remember that stare. And even though I left the forest... it will never leave me.",1,1757446395.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

  Leah, our new receptionist’s, singsong voice dances across the lobby from her spot at the sleek reception desk. I can see her legs under the desk. Her skirt has run up her thighs, and she’s wearing stockings.  
  
  I know this little show is for my benefit. Like it has been every day since she started. A different seduction technique, but it’s not escaped my radar that Leah wants to fuck me.  
  
  Of course she does. I’m hot and rich as fuck. And I’m also the boss. And the soon-to-be CEO of my family’s company, Under Her Lingerie, when my parents retire and hand the reins over to me.  
  
  That’s right. I sell underwear. Sexy-as-fuck underwear. The very thing that I love to peel off a woman’s body right before I screw her senseless.  
  
  I have the best job in the world.  
  
  “Good morning, Leah.” I give her a brief, pleasant smile. Not the smile I know can get women into bed or on their knees for me in minutes.  
  
  No flirting back with Leah because she works for me.  
  
  Rule number one: Never fuck the staff.  
  
  I don’t want or need the complications that sleeping with an employee would bring.  
  
  Aside from leaving myself wide open for a lawsuit and that my mother would kill me for dipping my pen in the company ink, I can’t deal with the drama and tears when she clues in to the fact that all I wanted from her was sex.  
  
  Even though I would have repeatedly told her that it was a one-time thing.  
  
  That’s rule number two: Always make it clear that hook-ups are just that.  
  
  Rule number three: Never let them know where you live, work, or what your phone number is just in case rule number two doesn’t stick.

They are the best. I know everyone here is sad to see them retire. There were a lot of tears the day it was announced.  
  
  Honestly, it will be weird for me, being here and running this place without them.  
  
  But I’m excited, too. This is what I’ve been working toward my whole life.  
  
  The elevator arrives on my floor, and I step out when the door opens. I walk through the lobby and toward the executive offices, and then I push open the door to my office area.  
  
  My PA, Chrissy, is already at her desk.  
  
  She lifts her head from her screen. “Morning, Wilder.” She picks up my takeout coffee from her desk, which she brings in for me every day, and holds it out.  
  
  She’s the best PA ever. I’m lucky to have her.  
  
  “Thanks.” I take the coffee and have a sip. I love my coffee hot, to the point of almost burning. How the hell people can drink lukewarm coffee is beyond me. The hotter, the better. Just how I like my women.  
  
  “Good weekend?” she asks me.  
  
  “Of course.” I grin.

  I am in no way ready to settle down with just one woman. I don’t have anything against relationships per se. I just don’t want one.  
  
  Well, not at the moment anyway. I like—no, I fucking love my life.  
  
  I love my job. And I love having a different woman in bed with me every weekend. I get to have regular sex without the demands and complications of a relationship, as there are always plenty of women willing to service my needs. But I’m not a selfish bastard. I like to make sure that the woman I’m screwing is having a good time. I can’t get off if she doesn’t.  
  
  I’m a total boss at oral sex. I’ve had a lot of practice. I fucking love going down on a woman. There’s nothing better to get me going than that first taste of a woman’s pussy.  
  
  I have a perfect setup.  
  
  Sex is reserved for weekends because the week is for work.  
  
  Work always comes first, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. Especially not now that I’ll be taking over the running of the company from my parents.  
  
  Maybe, in the distant future—like ten or fifteen years—I’ll me  
et some girl I want to have a relationship with, but if I’m being totally honest, I just can’t see it happening.  
  
  And, really, it would be grossly unfair to the women of Chicago if I took myself off the market. My dick is just too awesome to keep to one woman.  
  
  Sundays are brunch with the boys, so we can talk about the escapades from the night before, and then I usually spend the rest of Sunday working from home, getting ready for Monday morning.  
  
  “How was yours?” I know she was going to Milwaukee to spend the weekend with her fiancée’s parents.  
  
  Yes, fiancée, as in another woman. Chrissy is gay, and she’s getting married to a woman called Wendy. And, no, she’s not your stereotypical butch or porno-hot lesbian.  
  
  She’s just a normal, good-looking woman. And she runs my life like a champ.  
  
  “Yeah, it was okay, but Wendy and her mom were talking wedding stuff nonstop all weekend.”  
  
  She rolls her eyes, and I laugh.  
  
  “Anyway, I’ve got this morning’s schedule ready for you, but first, your mom and dad are waiting for you in your office.”  
  
  “They are?” I move my eyes in the direction of my office door.  
  
  “Yep.”  
  
  “How long have they been waiting?”  
  
  “Only five minutes or so.”  
  
  “And they didn’t say what they wanted to see me for?”  
  
  “Nope.”  
  
  A mild unease settles in my gut.  
  
  Of course, it’s not unusual for my parents to turn up in my office unannounced, but first thing in the morning is unusual.  
  
  The last time they were waiting in my office for me this early in the morning was seven years ago when I was in a much smaller, much shittier office, working in the sales department, and I’d just screwed up the Renshaw deal. The big deal that they’d trusted me with.  
  
  And, by screwed up, I mean, I’d screwed Mr. Renshaw’s daughter, Amber, a few months prior.  
  
  In my defense, I hadn’t known who she was then, and the deal was in its infancy at that point.  
  
  But the problem was, Amber had wanted more than one ride on my dick, and when I’d told her—as I’d told her before we boned down—that it was a one-off, she hadn’t been so happy at all.  
  
  Like took-her-high-heeled-shoe-off-and-threw-it-at-my-head not happy. I was lucky I hadn’t lost an eye.  
  
  Seriously, why is it that some women will agree to no-strings sex, and then once the sex is over, they completely forget the prior conversation?  
  
  I know my dick is awesome, but he doesn’t have mind-erasing skills.  
  
  I don’t have time for relationships. And I like my life the way it is. Sex with no strings.  
  
  But Amber had been at the dinner meeting with Mr. Renshaw, and she had taken one look at me, whispered something in her father’s ear, and that was the end of that. Renshaw had decided he no longer was interested in considering stocking our products in his department stores. Well, he hadn’t exactly put it that politely, but you can imagine what he’d said.  
  
  I get that she’s his daughter, but it’s not my fault that she’s batshit crazy. And, seriously, if the guy can’t detach business from personal, then we shouldn’t want to work with him anyway.  
  
  But my parents didn’t exactly see it that way.  
  
  I got reamed out for losing the deal and also a lecture from my mom about how I should be treating women with respect and not trying to sleep my way through Chicago.  
  
  But that was seven years ago, and even though it still bugs me that it was the one deal I fucked up, I have to allow myself the fact that I was wet behind the ears in business. Everyone is allowed one screwup in business.  
  
  But I didn’t let the Renshaw fiasco put me off. I like fucking way too much to stop having it on the regular.  
  
  I just had to learn to be a lot smarter about who I climbed into bed with, which means that I make sure to keep my weekend activities far, far away from anything associated with the office. One sniff of a business connection with a potential screw, and I’m out of there and on to the next.  
  
  Maybe my parents just want to talk about the takeover. My parents will be retiring in a few weeks, and I’ll be taking over as CEO.  
  
  I know what you’re thinking. I’m their son, and that’s why they are giving me the job.  
  
  Wrong.  
  
  My parents are hard-asses. We might have money, but they’ve made me work for everything. My parents came from nothing and built this business together, and they want me to understand that you have to work hard in this life if you want anything. Nothing is just handed to you.  
  
  I had part-time jobs throughout high school, so long as they didn’t interfere with my studies. The only time I didn’t work was when I was in college, as my parents wanted me to focus fully on my studies. But every summer was spent here, in the office, working for them—whether it was in the mailroom or on reception. I’ve worked my ass off to learn this business inside out.  
  
  I did four years at Northwestern, earning a business degree. And then I went off to Columbia where I got my MBA in management. When I graduated from Columbia, I came back home to Chicago and started working here in sales. I have worked in every department in the company so that I will understand the running of the business for when it is my time to take over.  
  
  And now is my time.  
  
  “Wish me luck,” I say to Chrissy.  
  
  “You don’t need it, Mr. Soon-to-Be CEO.” She says the last part on a whisper even though no one is around to hear.  
  
  When my parents announced their retirement a month ago, it wasn’t formally announced that I’d be taking over. Everyone probably already knows though. I mean, it’s a given.  
  
  That must be why they’re in there, waiting—to talk about the big announcement.  
  
  I don’t get excited about much, but I’m excited about this.  
  
  With thoughts of my impending CEO status, I open the door to my office with a big fucking smile on my face.  
  
  “Mom, Dad,” I greet them both.  
  
  They’re sitting on my black leather sofa. I fucking love my office. It’s big with floor-to-ceiling windows, so the view of the city is immense. And I have my own private bathroom, which is always a bonus.  
  
  “Wilder.” My mom smiles warmly. “How are you doing?”  
  
  “I’m good. What can I do for you this morning?” I ask as I walk the distance over to my desk.  
  
  A brief silence hangs in the air. That silence makes my gut tighten.  
  
  Then, my dad says, “We need to have a chat.”  
  
  “Okay.” I lower my ass into my chair.  
  
  They turn in their seats to face me. I don’t like what I see on their faces—unease.  
  
  Fuck.  
  
  I take a drink of my coffee, needing the burn to steady me, before lowering it to the desk. “What’s up?” I ask, forcing my voice to remain steady.  
  
  “Well…” My dad clears his throat.  
  
  “We have news,” Mom imparts, a fake cheeriness to her voice.  
  
  They’re not retiring. They’ve changed their minds.  
  
  Double fuck.  
  
  And me wanting them to retire does not make me a bad son or selfish. My parents have worked hard their whole lives, building this business up and making it into what it is today. But they’re in their late sixties, and I want them to take it easy and enjoy their golden years.  
  
  “Good or bad news?” My eyes flicker between the pair of them, trying to catch anything in their expressions, but they’re giving away nothing.  
  
  “Good news.” Mom beams a smile. “Isn’t it, Frank?” She nudges my dad in the side with her elbow.  
  
  He grunts a sound that she gives a disapproving look to. And that sound does nothing to appease the sick feeling I have right now.  
  
  “Now, honey, even though this is good news, I have a feeling you might not think so off the bat, but I just want you to have an open mind and listen to what we have to say.”  
  
  “Okay…” I’m so not okay.  
  
  “Well, there’s no other way to say this than to just say it, so…we’ve hired another CEO to come work here  
with you and help you run the company.”  
  
  “I’m sorry, what?” I’m pretty sure I’m having a stroke. I rub a hand over my frozen face and then stare over at my mom. “You’re gonna have to say that again because, for a second there…I thought you said that you’d hired another…CEO.”  
  
  “I did. And we have.”  
  
  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.  
  
  I stare at my mom’s steady face. My eyes move to my dad’s face. His expression is blank, giving me nothing.  
  
  “Is this a joke?”  
  
  “No,” my mother says softly. It’s the voice she used when I was younger and I was upset, and she was trying to soothe me.  
  
  The pacifying voice.  
  
  I used to love that voice. Now, I officially hate it.  
  
  “Why the fuck did you do that?”  
  
  “Language, Wilder,” my mom chastises.  
  
  Like now is the time to quibble over my use of the English language.  
  
  My wide eyes go to my dad. “Am I not getting the job?”  
  
  I see a flash of dismay in his eyes. “Of course you are,” my dad says, his tone resolute. “The job is yours, Wild. Without a doubt. Your mom just thought—”  
  
  “We both think”—my mom flashes a stern look at my dad—“that you could do with the support that having a co-CEO would offer. It’s a lot of work, running a business of this size.”  
  
  “I know. And I’m fully equipped and ready to do so. That’s what you’ve been training me to do for the past seven years. Jesus, I’ve been working toward this ever since I started coming in with you both when I was a kid. I know this business inside and out! No one knows the lingerie business better than I do.” I’m getting louder and louder, but I can’t help it.  
  
  A co-CEO. A motherfucking co-CEO!  
  
  “Wilder, we know how experienced and knowledgeable you are. It’s not about that. Your dad and I have successfully run this company together. Lots of companies nowadays have co-CEOs. There are a lot of benefits in having a partner to run the company with.”  
  
  I want to have an actual honest-to-God tantrum. Throw my toys out of my crib. Yell at them that they’re wrong. That I could run this company with one arm tied behind my back while blindfolded. I want to pull the how-could-you-do-this-to-your-own-kid card. It might work on my dad, but I know it wouldn’t work on my mom. She’s a tough cookie. My throwing a hissy fit would only reinforce to them that they made the right decision to hire this new person to come and work here with me.  
No, what I have to do is be mature about this.  
  
  Tell them that I’m dismayed that they did this. Not pissed. Dismayed. Especially because they went about it all covertly and behind my back.  
  
  But I’ll make sure to work with this new co-fucking-CEO asshole and be nice as pie.  
  
  And, in reality, I’ll be looking for a way to get rid of this job-stealing asshole while proving that I’m more than capable of running the company alone. My company.  
  
  I take a calming deep breath and place my hands, palms down, on my desk. “Well, I can’t say that I’m happy about this turn of events because I’m not. But it’s your company, and you’re free to do as you please with it. Yes, I’m your son—your only child—and heir. But you raised me right, and I’ll go along with whatever you think is best for the company.” Okay, so I’m laying it on a little thick, but a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do, and guilt is the only card I have to play here.  
  
  “Wilder, I know you’re thinking that we made this decision to bring someone else in because we think you can’t run the company alone. But that’s not the case.”  
  
  “I’m not thinking that at all. I know I’m more than capable of running the company alone.” My surly words echo my thoughts.  
  
  Okay, so my attempt to guilt trip them didn’t last very long, and that smart comment is definitely not going to help my cause, but I just couldn’t help it.  
  
  At my tenacity, I see a small smile touch my dad’s lips, which tells me this was more my mother’s idea than his. That gives me a boost, knowing that he’s not one hundred percent on board with this, so he’ll be easier to sway when the time comes.  
  
  “Of course you are, Wilder. But what’s made this company so successful is the male-female dynamic from your father and me.”  
  
  “So, from that, should I take it that you’ve hired a woman?”  
  
  “Yes. We’ve hired a female co-CEO to help you run the company. I love you, Wilder. You’re my son. You’re incredibly bright and talented. But, when it comes to women, you don’t have a clue. You don’t understand their wants and needs.”  
  
  I’m mortally offended by this. I know women’s needs very well, but it’s not like I can vocalize this to my mom. I mean, no guy wants to share his sexual expertise with his mother.  
  
  My brow goes up. “That’s a very sexist thing for you to say, Mom.”  
  
  My dad smothers a laugh.  
  
  My mom throws an annoyed glance at my dad and then looks back at me, her brows furrowed in annoyance. “I meant that you don’t understand their wants and needs when it comes to the actual items. That can only come from being a woman. And having both a male and female viewpoint helps enormously with the business we’re in. My view comes from a woman’s perspective—of actually wearing and understanding the product, the issues of materials and comfort as well as the look. Your father’s perspective is in sales and focused on branding. Together, we’ve been a formidable team. I want that for you.”  
  
  “I’m not marrying this chick.”  
  
  “Of course not!” My mother’s laugh tinkles around the room.  
  
  “Your mother just wants you to have a counterbalance, Wilder,” my dad says.  
  
  “Why didn’t you tell me this before now?”  
  
  “Because we weren’t sure that we were going to find the right person to fit the role.”  
  
  “And, now, you have?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “Just out of curiosity, what would you have done if you hadn’t found the right woman for the job?”  
  
  My mother’s shoulders lift. “We would have crossed that bridge when we came to it.”  
  
  I know my parents love me, but this sure does feel a lot like betrayal, and it tastes bitter as fuck.  
  
  “We’re not doing this to hurt you, Wilder. You know we’ve only ever had your best interests at heart.”  
  
  “Mmhmm.” I fold my arms over my chest. “And how long will I be co-CEOing for?”  
  
  My mom’s brows draw together. “What do you mean?”  
  
  “I mean, how long will I have to share my job for?”  
  
  My parents glance at each other and then back at me.  
  
  “Well, we’re not sure…exactly,” my mom answers.  
  
  “So, that means, I will one day have the company to run alone?”  
  
  My mother looks at my father again. But he’s looking at me.  
  
  “Yes,” he says decisively. “Wilder, you know the company will be yours when your mother and I are gone. And you can do as you choose with it then.”  
  
  “Well, I’m hoping you don’t go anytime soon, and I’d quite like to run the business solo well before then.”  
  
  “Let’s put a pin in this for now.” My mother claps her hands together, ending the conversation.  
  
  Put a pin in it? Jesus fucking Christ. We’re talking about my life here, and my mom wants to stick a pin in it.  
  
  But I know that pushing the issue right now will get me nowhere. I need to tackle this again—and soon—but at this moment in time, I need to deal with the crap they’ve just dropped in my lap.  
  
  “So, when do I get to meet this mystery woman?” Who’s stealing half of my company.  
  
  Okay, she’s not actually stealing it, but she’s definitely stealing half of my job.  
  
  “Tomorrow.”  
  
  “Tomorrow,” I echo.  
  
  “Yes, she’s coming in first thing tomorrow morning to meet with you. And then, afterward, in the weekly meeting, we’ll formally announce her new role along with your step up as co-CEOs.”  
  
  Co-CEO. The word makes me want to vomit.  
  
  If I didn’t love my parents, I would legit strangle them right now. With my bare hands.  
  
  A day. I’ve got a motherfucking day to get my head around this…this curveball that they’ve thrown at me.  
  
  “I know you’re worried about this, Wilder, but Morgan is great, and you do actually already know her,” my mom says.  
  
  That brings my head up. “I know her?”  
  
  Please God don’t let it be someone I slept with. Not that I do much sleeping with the women I have sex with. I’m not one to hang around after the deed is done.  
  
  “Morgan told us that you went to Northwestern together,” my dad says.  
  
  Morgan. Northwestern. Went together.  
  
  This isn’t sounding good.  
  
  And knowing my fuck rate at Northwestern, my odds of not having screwed this chick are diminishing by the second.  
  
  I swallow past the dryness in my throat. “What’s her surname?”  
  
  “Stickford,” Mom says. “Morgan Stickford.”  
  
  Ah, hell.  
  
  Morgan Stick-Up-Her-Ass-Ford.  
  
  Relief and dismay sweep through me in equal measure.  
  
  Relief because I definitely didn’t sleep with her in college.  
  
  Dismay because she hated me in college.  
  
  Which was a shame because she was a pretty thing. Well, her face was, which was always on show—as her hair was habitually tied back into a ponytail—unlike her body, which was always covered up with ugly-ass big sweaters.  
  
  And she was so damn serious all the time. Hence the nickname Stick-Up-Her-Ass-Ford.  
  
  She never went to parties. She spent all her time either in the library or with her nose stuck up the professors’ asses.  
  
  I never once heard of her socializing or saw her with any friends. She was a stuck-up bitch who thought that she was better than everyone else. Me included.  
  
  Morgan Stickford took an instant dislike to me from the word go without even bothering to get to know me.  
  
  She came to the conclusion that I was an overprivileged, womanizing man-whore.  
  
  Okay, so I did have certain privileges growing up because of my parents’ success, and, yes, I had a job to walk straight into out of college, but believe me, my parents made me work for it. Nothing has ever been handed to me. I’ve earned everything I have.  
  
  And, sure, I liked ass. I still do. But, back then, I was young and horny. Hot college girls were everywhere, and I made sure to screw almost all of them.  
  
  Except for he  
r.  
  
  Because she took one look at me and thought she had me pegged. When, in actuality, she knew fuck all about me.  
  
  Did it annoy the shit out of me? Sure, it did. But I wasn’t going to lose sleep over a stuck-up bitch who went around and made snap judgments about people she barely knew.  
  
  But then that was nine years ago. A lot can change in nine years. Maybe Morgan Stickford has changed.  
  
  Well, I hope to fuck she has because, for the short-term—until I get rid of her—I’m stuck with sharing my company with her.  
  
  Even though I had a shitload of work to get through today, I couldn’t focus on anything after the nuclear bomb my parents had dropped on me.  
  
  So, I did what every other person in my position would do.  
  
  I stalked Morgan online.  
  
  I might have known her back in college—not that I really knew her that well—but I definitely don’t know Morgan now.  
  
  I don’t know what she’s been up to in the last nine years. Or if she’s still a massive bitch.  
  
  And do you know what I got for spending my day researching her?  
  
  Fuck. All.  
  
  She doesn’t have a Twitter or Instagram account. She does have a Facebook account—well, if it’s hers. I could only find one account for a Morgan Stickford in Chicago. But that was locked down tight—just like her legs had been in college—so I figured it had to be her.  
  
  After my unsuccessful Morgan stalking, I sent the boys an SOS text and asked them to meet me at Doyle’s. It’s an Irish pub that’s popular with the after-work crowd. I like it there. The feel is laid-back, and the food is great. Not that I feel like eating. But drinking? I definitely feel like drinking. That shows how stressed I am. I rarely drink during the week.  
  
  I push through the door into Doyle’s. I see Cooper’s already here, sitting at the bar, sipping on a beer.  
  
  Coop is my oldest friend. Even though I’m tight with Dom, Coop is my best friend. I’ve known him since high school. Went to Northwestern with me, which is where we met Dom. But Coop hadn’t needed to go to college. He’s richer than I am. I’m pretty sure he’s richer than God. He comes from old money.  
  
  I’m sure you’ve heard of Delaney’s. The big-ass supermarket chain.  
  
  Coop is the heir to Delaney’s. His great-grandpa started the business way back when, which he passed on to Coop’s grandpa. Coop’s mom was Grandpa Delaney’s only kid. And all she did was spend Grandpa Delaney’s money and get knocked up by Coop’s dad. Weird thing is, no one knows who Coop’s dad is. His mom has never said. To this day, Coop still doesn’t know. His mom’s a selfish bitch. She was hardly there while Coop was growing up; she was too busy traveling the world and finding the next man to marry. She’s been married eight times. I shit you not.  
  
  Grandpa Delaney raised Coop. Sadly, he died of lung cancer when Coop was sixteen. Coop didn’t take it well. He took it even worse when he found out that Grandpa Delaney had left him everything. He was sixteen and clueless. So, a CEO was brought in to run the company until Coop was ready to step into his rightful place.  
  
  He never has.  
  
  After he graduated college, he just bummed around for a bit. He still kind of does. He spends his days sleeping and his nights partying and screwing beautiful woman and getting his name in the gossip columns on a regular basis.  
  
  I think he’s capable of so much more. No, I know he’s capable of more. But I don’t push the issue. He’s my best friend, and it’s his decision how he chooses to run his life.  
  
  Unlike me. Apparently, I have no fucking say in what happens in my life.  
  
  “Hey, man.” I pat Coop on the back, taking the stool next to him.  
  
  “Hey. Your usual?” he asks me.  
  
  “Yep.”  
  
  He signals to the bartender and orders me a Corona.  
  
  “So, what’s up?” he asks.  
  
  “Everything.” My life. Morgan goddamn Stick-Up-Her-Ass-Ford.  
  
  I drag my hands down my face and let out a groan.  
  
  “That bad?”  
  
  “Worse,” I tell him.  
  
  The bartender puts my beer in front of me. I pick it up and down half of the bottle before putting it back down.  
  
  “Better?” Coop asks.  
  
  “Nope.” I slide a look at him. “Mom and Dad went behind my back and hired someone to come and work with me. A ‘co-CEO.’” I air-quote.  
  
  “Shit. You’re kidding.”  
  
  “Wish I were.” I sigh. “And it gets worse. The person they’ve hired to share my job with me is Morgan Stickford.”  
  
  “Morgan Stickford…” Coop’s brows draw together in thought.  
  
  “We went to Northwestern with her,” I say. “She always used to sit in the front row. Wore those baggy-ass sweaters all the time. I used to call her Morgan Stick-Up-Her-Ass-Ford.”  
  
  “Oh, yeah.” Coop clicks his fingers in recognition. “Curvy. Blonde hair.”  
  
  “That’s the one.”  
  
  “Fuck…she hated your guts in college, man.” Coop laughs as he picks up his beer and takes a drink. “Why was that?”  
  
  “I guess she thought I was a rich prick.”  
  
  “You are. But so am I. And she didn’t hate me.”  
  
  “Who didn’t hate you?” Dom drops into the stool next to Coop.  
  
  “Morgan Stickford,” Coop tells him. “You remember her from Northwestern?”  
  
  “God, yeah. Haven’t heard that name in a while though. I used to work shifts with her at Starbucks.”  
  
  Unlike Coop and me, Dom’s family wasn’t rich. He was at Northwestern on a scholarship. But he created this dating app after he graduated, and it went big. Really big.  
  
  “Did you?” I say to Dom. “How did I not know that?”  
  
  Dom shrugs. “She was a nice girl. Didn’t like you though, if I remember right.”  
  
  “She hated his guts,” Coop clarifies.  
  
  “Thanks for the reminder.” I grimace at him.  
  
  “I’ll have a draft beer,” Dom tells the bartender, who just approached. “Why are we talking about Morgan Stickford anyway?” he asks.  
  
  “Because Wild’s mom and dad just hired her to be the CEO at his company.”  
  
  “What?” Dom’s head swivels to me. “I thought you were getting the job.”  
  
  “I am. They are bringing her in as co-CEO. Apparently, they think I need a woman’s perspective to help me run the company, which is just fucking bullshit and a massive fucking insult.”  
  
  “Feel for you, man.” Dom pats my shoulder and then picks up the beer the bartender just put in front of him.  
  
  “What are you gonna do?” Coop asks me.  
  
  “Not much I can do.” I shrug. “Morgan’s coming in tomorrow, and the announcement will be made to the rest of the staff. Then, I have to share my company with her.”  
  
  God, I fucking hate my life right now.  
  
  And I know hate is a very strong word, so I won’t use it in reference to my parents, but I will say that I seriously, intensely do not like them right now.  
  
  “And that’s it?” Dom says. “You’re just gonna sit back and accept it.”  
  
  Coop laughs. “Come on, this is Wilder we’re talking about. No fucking way will he just roll over and take this. At least, not without a fight.”  
  
  “Oh, I intend to fight all right.” And I’ll fight as dirty as I need to. But I need to get my battle plan together, and I can’t do that until I meet with Morgan tomorrow and know what her deal is. “But, right now, I’m gonna have a drink with my buddies and maybe shoot some pool later. Who’s with me?”  
  
  “Always with you, man,” Coop says. “But I think we need something stronger than beer for this.” He signals the bartender. “Three shots of Jägermeister,” he tells him.  
  
  “No shots,” I tell Coop. “I’ve got work in the morning.”  
  
  I can’t be hungover when I meet Morgan. Especially not when I have to stand there during the big announcement of her new role in the company.  
  
  The thought alone makes me want to puke all over this bar.  
  
  “I don’t want a shot. I’ve got an early meeting  
tomorrow,” Dom tells Coop.  
  
  “Stop being pussies, the pair of you. Just one shot won’t kill you.”  
  
  “Fine.” I sigh. “One shot, and that’s it.”  
  
  “Sure thing, man.” Coop grins.  
  
  The bartender pours out our drinks. “Enjoy.”  
  
  Coop picks up a glass and holds it out to us. “Let’s toast.”  
  
  “What the fuck do I have to toast about? How I just lost half of my company?”

So, I, 43F; met this guy, 51M in OLD. We started talking and he was super nice and I really liked him. We have been chatting for quite some time. Agreed to meet and planned to meet today at 5PM for a coffee somewhere. Yesterday was a really busy day for me and I didn’t really spoke with him but when he sent me a good night text I replied and also said “can’t wait to meet you”. This morning again he messaged, as usual, saying good morning. I messaged briefly, wasn’t awake fully yet, then later  I got ready to leave as I had to go to my bestie’s to drop off something so I left around 2ish; went to my bestie’s to drop off a package and also to have a coffee with her before going to the meeting location. It was max 30 min drive for me. At around 3:30; he messaged and I said “I’m getting ready to come meet you.” Then he got super weird; saying he wasn’t sure we were meeting etc. We talked a bit and he said not to leave the house yet to which I replied I’m at my bestie’s and will leave when he texts me. But that text never came. His last message was at 5:15. I messaged at 6, and again at 7, which he hasn’t read yet. So, I’m really not sure if I should add the conversation here or not but umm I have screenshots of the conversation I had with this guy. I’m not entirely sure what to do now coz I really liked him and I’m getting the vibes that he also liked me a lot and don’t know how to interpret this situation now. Shall I add the screenshots?

1ncsaqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1ncsaqq/connected_dreams_from_years_apart_feel_like/,Connected dreams from years apart feel like living through someone else,"This first dream I’m describing was a couple years ago and it was just a brief moment, but so vivid. I was in a clean, uncluttered living room painted in warm beige with pale red accent decor. An overwhelming sense of peace and comfort filled the air, the room illuminated by a golden sunset through a picture window with gossamer shades. I sat on an earthy corduroy couch while she stood next to me. I was exhausted. 

My wife was beautiful. Blonde, wispy shoulder length hair, a tired smile. We were both around late 20’s, early 30’s. I had been away for a long time and she smiled softly with relief that I was back. I knew we had 2 children that missed me dearly but never saw their faces. I couldn’t bear to look directly at her, keeping my head down. I saw a gold band on her finger that still fit perfectly after so many years. 

 “I’m so glad you’re finally home.”

“I have to leave again soon.”

“… I know.”

I woke with a dreadful sadness. Minutes passed like ages as the moment faded away. That feeling lingered for days after. 

This morning I dozed off for 20 minutes after my morning coffee. I found myself sitting in the middle of a white bench seat in a dimly lit cafeteria in an old school. A bland meal of meat and potatoes with brown gravy lay on a plain tray in front of me. High, cloudy windows let in a grey/blue pallor. I was no older than 12, a prepubescent boy, and surrounded by unfamiliar faces. I knew they were my friends. The boys were rowdy, playing with food and laughing. Looking behind me, the girls’ table was likewise full of chatter and animation. 

She looked back and we locked eyes. My throat closed and eyes widened. It was her - hair golden and eyes pale. She didn’t smile but her eyes were fixed onto me and I just knew she was peering right into me. She felt the same longing that I carried deep in my belly. She was just as pretty then and in that moment I could see the beautiful woman she would become years later. After our gaze broke I turned away but knew she was whispering her affection to her friends. This was the first time we met, I knew with absolute certainty. 

I was then standing past the lunch tables, presumably dumping my tray. Her friend stood at the end of the table and upon seeing me, the girl placed herself between her friend and where I was walking to go back to my seat. I approached confidently, turning sideways to get past but looking again into her eyes. My brain defaulted to awkward midwestern, as I said slowly

“Just gotta sneak past you”

My hand gently touched her side as I scooted by. Electricity vibrated my arm and pulling away was like tugging a magnet from a block of iron. 

I was then sitting on a couch in a dusty, smoky living room. It was dark, illuminated only by a tube TV with static on the curved glass screen. This house was old with uneven wood flooring, and the coffee table next to me was cluttered with beer cans and cigarette butts. It was vaguely reminiscent of a house I once lived in. 

I was tired with age and loneliness, staring at the humming static of the TV. The air went from still to a rush of cold. Snow began to fall all around me and quickly became a whirling blizzard. The chill was so powerful and the freezing flakes felt like tiny blades stabbing my face and uncovered arms. A loud, pounding sound reverberated from the kitchen without a seen source. From around a corner, my real-life sandy orange cat came running out toward me. He’s my best friend and has been with me for years now. 

Suddenly the foundation shook and I felt everything lifted up under a massive air current. It felt like being inside the house in The Wizard of Oz during the tornado. I was disoriented and dizzy from the motion.

 At this point I awakened to this feeling of motion sickness and a chill, but it felt less impactful than the first scene of this kid’s love at first sight. The first part of today’s dream felt disconnected from the second, like the second part was “me”, but the part about this relationship was like I was seeing through the eyes of someone else, and the same for the one years ago. In real life I am a trans woman and usually feel/act like my true self in them. But there was no doubt that this dream person felt intimately connected to the one I had back then. I’m in a weird mood today over it.

1ncs9ah,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ncs9ah,"Bimbo’s, the failed drive-in chain that started in Scottsdale in 1956","It was built on the NE corner of Scottsdale rd and Indian School after Winfield Scott’s home was leveled in 1955. It was planned to open in late 1955, but delays pushed the grand opening back to February 4, 1956. 

Each location would feature two steer heads that were designed by Scottsdale High School senior, Bob Fransler. He created one that measured 12 feet from horn to horn that they accepted for the Scottsdale location and was asked to make them for the other locations as well. It’s unclear if any others were made though as this would be the only location to open. There was one being built in Tempe at Eighth and Mill in Tempe, but the owners ran into financial issues and it would never open.

The locations were taken over by another set of California based investors who already had 17 restaurants across Cali. They would rename the Scottsdale Bimbo’s to Stage Stop Drive-In, and continue working on the Tempe location, which supposedly looked the same as the Scottsdale one.

Stage Stop would open on November 13, 1956. It changed hands at least once in early 1957, but the business would stay until July of 1957 when they closed for renovations and never reopened. A few months later, the California based chain of coffee shops, Huddle, would open their first valley location in the building. The grand opening was held on November 15 and 16, 1957. They would also take over the spot in Tempe, building a restaurant that was a staple for ASU students for years after it opened in 1958.

The Huddle was a popular spot for local groups to hold meetings, while also being a popular hangout for students at the neighboring Scottsdale High. It would close sometime after December 20, 1958 and before January 22, 1959. The next business to go in would be Alan LeWinter’s House of Pancakes. The coffee shop chain started in the Sands Hotel in late 1958, and would expand into Scottsdale for their second location.

It stayed there until 1963, when LeWinter rebranded, distancing itself from the International House of Pancakes that first entered the valley market the previous year. The restaurant would be remodeled, adding ornate iron work to the outside, paving the parking lot, and just overall giving it a fresh look. This renovation, along with a name change to Buddy’s Coffee Shop, was announced on November 4, 1963. Buddy’s was a chain LeWinter had opened along Central ave in Phoenix a few months earlier. 

The Scottsdale Buddy’s would open on December 22, 1963. It was like most other coffee shops in town, but it was very short lived. A fire broke out on January 2, 1963, destroying about 80-85% of the building. Pretty much the only part to survive was a section newly built during the renovation that met the current fire code, while the older portions didn’t. No one was hurt during the fire. 

The charred building was left for a while, but LeWinter would rebuild there. It was first a cocktail lounge/coffee shop named Scandia that opened in 1967, followed by other high end dining/club endeavors that LeWinter rebranded the building into. He would leave the spot sometime between 1971 and 1972. It was announced on February 23, 1974 that the valley’s first Benihana of Tokyo would be moving into the former Pepper Mill Steak House (the last LeWinter restaurant there). Benihana would open its doors to the press on May 16, with the grand opening held the next day. It would stay open until January 25, 1983 when their lease expired and their building was leveled to make way for Scottsdale Financial Center 2.

If anyone has pictures of this place or any of the businesses that occupied the NE corner of Indian School and Scottsdale, please share them here or with the Scottsdale Library. If you have items from any of these places such as mugs, please share photos as there is very little out there about them.

The job seems very repetitive and sometimes funny. It feels like there is nothing to add here at all. Given that safety is quite good here, there is nothing to add here. It is all about maintaining a bulk of documents, some kind of project management stuff, briefing the same people about same thing everyday, investigating the silliest incidents (e.g., broken leg of a coffee table). etc. Feels like I am wasting time here. I have totally lost the drive. And when I think of this as all these only add to making something as sillyas cigarettes, I take a laugh at it (but I do acknowledge that safety is really important). I am still in my probation. What do you think, shall I make a move to switch my career now or waste some more time here?

1ncrzr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ncrzr7/fall_themed_sample_haul_review/,Fall Themed Sample Haul Review,"Hi everyone, 

I just got a fall themed batch of samples and wanted to let everyone know my thoughts. I'm a guy but I tend towards more unisex fragrances because I find them more interesting. So from most to least liked:

1. PDM Althair - I recently sampled Happy Dust by Narcotica and I've been on a bit of a vanilla kick as a result. I was hesitant to try Althair because I'm not a fan of cinnamon and orange blossom notes usually, but oh my god this is so pretty. The notes are blended so well that its more then the sum of its parts, with no one note overpowering . It is powdery in a way that makes it smell fizzy and effervescent like a cream soda. It dries down into that beautiful vanilla that lasted around 8 hours on me as a skin scent. 11/10 

2. Apple Brandy on the Rocks by Killian - Full disclosure I'm not a huge fan of angel share, I mostly get the smell of oak from it and it reminds me of waiting for the pirates of the Caribbean ride near the barrels. This one is much more fun and flirty. The apple and pineapple really play well together with the cedar. The cinnamon is more what I expected from Althair though, where its a touch overpowering and I wish it was dialed back a little. But all in all a delicious fruity boozy apple pie scent 9/10. 

3. Armani Prive The Yulong - She pretty. This is the most photorealistic tea scent I've smelled where the tea plays the lead role. The Jasmine and Iris play supporting roles with (thankfully) brief cameos from orange and my floral nemesis orange blossom. Longevity was good with about 6 hours skin scent. Projection was non existent. Overall solid. 8/10 

4. Zarkoperfumes Pink Molecule - This one is weird in a really fun way. I was expecting a sweet gourmand and I got a much more elegant gourmand. The champagne note comes off a touch sour but its balanced by the apricot and this light airy vanilla that's supposed to be whipped cream. The wood adds a unique smell that isn't sandalwood to this that gives it a masculine edge underneath the sugar. Performance is okay like 5 hours on skin, projection is weak but there. Definitely a good date night scent. 8/10 

5. Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt - Not bad by any means but just not what I expected. I wanted a slightly floral blue scent and got a slightly aquatic floral. The sage is beautiful in this and essentially photorealistic but is the main attraction here. The rest of the notes sort of blend in the background, I really had to work to smell the seaweed note for instance. Longevity was a solid 6 hours skin projection was ok. Not a love but definitely a like. 6/10

6. Hermes Terre d'Hermes - Not a lot to say about this one, its inoffensive but boring. I was hoping that the Pelargonium and the Flint would add something unique to this otherwise derivative designer formula but unfortunately not. Maybe it was more unique in 2006 but not today. Projection is good for the first 3-4 hours after that skin for another 3. Meh. 5/10

7. Strangers Perfumerie Yuzu Soda - This isn't bad for what it is but it was advertised as a soda and the fizz was severely lacking imo. For context I love soda scents generally and one of my favorites is born to be unforgettable by killian. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I thought Althair was more of a soda scent. That aside though its a lovely mint citrus scent that reminds me of a sweeter torino 21 by xerjoff with a more synthetic mint. But I cant forgive the marketing. 4/10 

8. Mischief Academy Mad Hatter - So every time I order samples I try to get at least one sample from a perfumer I've never heard of. Mischief academy caught my eye because of the cute public domain fairy tale theming and I thought why not? This scent is described as ""an electric fragrance featuring bold rum and toffee accords, enriched by the creamy sweetness of milk and butter. Edged with notes of leather, black tea, and saffron, it transports you to a whimsical tea party."" And the rum note truly is bold, so bold in fact that it overpowers every other note. If you want to smell like you went on a bender at your niece's tea party then this is for you! 2/10 

9. Mancera Amore Cafe - Easily my biggest disappointment of the entire haul. Guys I wanted to love this so much. I love coffee, I love vanilla, I love coffee ice cream. However when you spray this you get immediately punched by a screechy synthetic coffee scent that smells more chocolate to my nose. Eventually the smell dies down and vanilla becomes the central player but why god why would I put myself through that opening. I'll try this again and update if I change my mind but that seems unlikely. My search for a decent coffee scent continues. 2/10 

10. Memo Irish Leather - Oh boyyyyyyy, where to even start with this one? So for context I enjoy leather scents. My first full bottle purchase was Dior's Fahrenheit and that is one of the most leather leathers to ever leather. However I think many people would agree that leather isn't the most wearable everyday kind of note. I first found out about Irish leather by looking at online reviews for a leather scent that was more wearable. From the notes it sounded exactly what I was looking for with a fruity opening, a herbal heart and leather wood and vetiver in the base. Oh my god it was not that at all. Immediately you are sucker punched by the vetiver but it smells identical to hay. What I'm assuming then is supposed to be the juniper comes in with a metallic twang that makes the hay smell wet and ozonic. Beneath all that you get a whiff of leather. So to summarize it smells exactly like I'm mucking horse stables on a rainy day. I'd believe this was an unreleased zoologist horse scent 0/10 

Thanks for reading and I hope you got something out of it. I'd genuinely love to hear your thoughts on these or any dupes/alternatives.

I was diagnosed with vertigo last month. 2 weeks ago i was out with friends and when we were walking across the parking lot to my boyfriend's place I suddenly fell and hit my head hard. I hit so hard I was stunned, unable to speak and nobody could pick me up. I kept slipping. Ambulance was called, I got a ct scan and was told concussion, rest up, not much we can do. I just made the cab fare on the dollar! I'm typing with sunglasses on if anyone is wondering how I'm doing this. 

Since then I've been very dizzy, i cry a lot. I cannot look far without spinning out, I'm housebound. I'm unable to go out and get what I need my elderly mother helps me and I feel so useless. I used to be out and about every day but now i'm housebound in my small apartment and going absolutely crazy. I think I lost myself. I cry a lot for no reason. I always had depression but this another level. I just CAN'T DO THIS and nobody understands. I always hear from people (not on here though) well I had a concussion too and I got through....I used to love seeing people now I can't bear to see anyone. I don't want to. I feel nothing for anyone. I'm full of pain and apathy. I just want to go for a walk and get a friggin' coffee but I can't. My balance is so off. I have to hold onto walls to get to the bathroom. My vertigo is even worse. Is this normal?  I live in Ontario and have to wait over a month to see my doctor again. I can't cope. I went to walk-ins but was told to see my doctor. No answers.  I feel like I lost parts of my personality and emotions other then deep sadness. Could I have serious brain damage? I was diagnosed with a ""mild"" concussion but it feels so bad. I cannot imagine a severe one. I really feel bad for those worse.

1ncrqa2,https://i.redd.it/fm7sy29as6of1.jpeg,detailed and accurate calculations of how sweaty and smelly Yi xuan shifu's armpits are !,"# 🧮 Sweat Calculation

# 1. Basal Sweat Rate (Resting)

* Average at rest: **\~0.3 L/hour total body**.
* Yi Xuan’s height: **172 cm** → taller people tend to have slightly larger sweat gland coverage.
* Adjusted baseline: **\~0.35 L/hour**.

# 2. Activity/Combat Factor

* In combat, sweat rate increases **3–4×**.
* Let’s use **3.5× multiplier**:0.35 L/hr×3.5=1.225 L/hr0.35 \\, L/hr \\times 3.5 = 1.225 \\, L/hr0.35L/hr×3.5=1.225L/hr≈ **1.2 liters/hour total body**.

# 3. Armpit Contribution

* Armpits contribute \~8–10% of sweat output (though disproportionately smelly).
* Taking 10%:1.2 L/hr×0.10=0.12 L/hr1.2 \\, L/hr \\times 0.10 = 0.12 \\, L/hr1.2L/hr×0.10=0.12L/hrper armpit → **120 mL/hr each**.
* Both armpits = **240 mL/hour**.

That’s about **one paper coffee cup’s worth of sweat per hour**.

# 💨 Stink Calculation

Sweat alone doesn’t smell—odor is caused by **bacteria metabolizing sweat** (especially apocrine sweat in armpits).

# 1. Normal Armpit Odor

* Let’s assign a baseline “odor index” = **1.0** for an average person.

# 2. Stress Multiplier

* Combat/fighting raises adrenaline → more apocrine secretion → **×2.0** smell factor.

# 3. Clothing Factor

* Yi Xuan wears **tight leather-like bodysuit** with minimal ventilation.
* Enclosed, warm, moist → **×1.5** smell factor.

# 4. Companion Factor

* She has a **magical raven** perched on her.
* Birds can increase “warmth retention” near her shoulder → **×1.3** (joking but plausible).

# 5. Total Smell Multiplier

2.0×1.5×1.3=3.92.0 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.3 = 3.92.0×1.5×1.3=3.9

So, her armpit smell is **\~4× stronger than average**.

# 📊 Final Numbers

* **Sweat per hour (both armpits):** \~240 mL
* **Smell intensity:** \~3.9× a normal person
* **Translation:** Yi Xuan could **fill a can of soda with armpit sweat in \~3 hours**, and it would smell like **a crowded locker room times four**.",33,1757444419.0,ZenlessZoneZero,16,0.78,False

Textured milk to the unknowing sounds different, interesting and ‘new’ but really, this is the same steamed and I assume, textured milk as their regular latte. But this time it’s served in a cup rather than a glass and includes that baristas best attempt at latte art.

all i do is go to class, do my coursework, and go home. rinse and repeat. it's not that i don't want friends. i do. i want someone to text me after class, to actually follow up on ""we should hang out sometime"" instead of letting it float into the abyss for the umpteenth fucking time, to invite me to get coffee without me having to be the one to break the silence every damn time. but nah. all i get is motherfucking compliments on my outfits (thank you, i know i look good. i have a mirror in my room for a reason) and weak ass small talk after class, and everyone evaporates back into their little bubbles.

maybe i'm not memorable enough. not in the way that matters, at least. i'm the ""realest bitch in the room"", the classmate they're ""intimidated"" by all because i don't sugarcoat a damn thing and my tone can be rather deadpan or blunt at times, the classmate they chat with for 30 seconds, not the friend they think to hit up when they're bored on a friday night. it is exhausting. it is painful. it is dreadful. it makes me question if i even exist to them beyond whatever surface-level moment we share in lecture. sometimes, it makes me not even bother wanting to commute to class even though i live a mere 35 minutes away from campus via train.

meanwhile, all these out-of-towners come here with their ""NYC experience"" fantasy and it drives me up a fucking wall. y'all will fetishize the fuck out of my city, posting tiktoks like ""hot girl walks to my $9 iced latte in soho 💕✨"" but the second they get catcalled, mugged, or god forbid harassed, suddenly it's too real. like…welcome to what i've lived my whole life??? you wanted gritty, you wanted authentic, now you're crying on facetime with your mama because little miss nyc didn't play nice with you. bitch shut the fuck up.

and believe me, it ain't even just annoyance. it is isolating. because they'll never understand what it is like to be born and raised here, to have this city in your bones. to see your home turned into a backdrop for someone else's 1-and-a-half stars on letterboxd coming-of-age movie, that life doesn't stop being complicated just because some bitch from california who need her roots touched up decided they want to cosplay carrie bradshaw for a semester.

On the drive home from my final shift I remember feeling like this massive weight was just lifted off my shoulders and like I could finally breathe. I used to think that even though I knew my job sucked, that management and customers both treated me like garbage, that ""it was just a job"" and ""nobody likes working"" but if I had to quantify it I would say my anxiety has decreased by AT LEAST 70%. Obviously working is always gonna be hard for people with anxiety, but it is possible to have a job (even an entry level one) that doesn't make you actively hate yourself and hate your life.

I took up drinking not long after I started there to cope with how stressed out it made me, and took up smoking literally just as an excuse to get extra breaks. I would have had a lot more saved if I didn't blow half of it on alcohol. But also alcohol was at times the only thing that was getting me through the week. In retrospect, I wish I had just thugged it out for like a year and then used those savings to get trained in something better but oh well. Thankfully my drinking never got *too* out of control so I did still have some savings left over toward the end.

I know that not everybody is in a good position to just up and quit their job, I'm lucky to have received a grant to go to college and to have a dad who works a good job and can support me. My college offers a ton of recourses for people with anxiety and all my instructors are great, *it was genuinely disorienting to have so much freedom, and to be around people who won't scream at me for making a tiny mistake, or make fun of me.*

1ncrf58,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedTech/comments/1ncrf58/explore_if_the_best_wireless_headset_jabra_engage/,Explore if the best wireless headset Jabra Engage 65 lives up to hype,"Testing the Jabra 9559-553-125 (better known as the Jabra Engage 65 Stereo), the first thing you notice is its lightweight feel. As someone who spends way too much time juggling phone calls, Zoom meetings, and answering messages, I was skeptical about whether this wireless headset could really keep up with my nonstop schedule. The promise of professional-grade features like advanced noise cancellation and all-day battery life intrigued me, but does it deliver? I’ve spent a couple of weeks with this headset glued to my ears—figuratively speaking—and here’s my honest take.

**Design and Comfort**  
The design is clean, modern, and all about productivity. It’s safe to say the Jabra Engage 65 isn’t trying to start a fashion revolution, but it nails functionality. The over-ear cups fit comfortably, even during marathon workdays, and the plastic build manages to remain surprisingly sturdy without feeling cheap. Weighing just 2.89 ounces, it’s lighter than most headsets I’ve tried and doesn’t leave that annoying pressure some heavier options do. Bonus points for the integrated busylight, which lights up when you're in a call. It has spared me from countless interruptions by my overzealous coworkers. Let’s just say, I wish every headset came with this ingenious little addition.

**Performance and Sound Clarity**  
This headset’s performance is impressive. The DECT wireless connectivity kept me tether-free up to 490 feet away from my desk. Yes, you read that right—I wandered into the kitchen, outside to grab the mail, and even upstairs without losing connection. Many wireless options drop the ball when it comes to range, so this was a huge plus. Now, let’s talk sound clarity. The advanced noise-cancelling microphone ensures clear calls without those embarrassing, ""Can you hear me now?"" moments. It cut out barking dogs and annoying keyboard clatter, making me feel way more professional on calls than I actually am.

[Check Jabra 9559-553-125 price on Amazon.](https://soundcontroltech.com/p/b07c39k74w/)  

**Battery Life and Charging Options**  
The battery life on this headset is no joke. With up to 13 hours of talk time, I only had to charge it twice in my two weeks of testing. The fast-charge feature is a game-changer—40 percent charge in just 30 minutes? Sign me up. By the time I grabbed lunch and dodged another email thread, it was ready to rock again. Whether you’re glued to your desk all day or moving between meetings, the battery won’t leave you stranded mid-call. If there’s one area where it excels head and shoulders above rivals, it’s here.

**Pluses**  
- Lightweight design for all-day comfort  
- Integrated busylight to minimize interruptions  
- Exceptional wireless range (up to 490 feet)  
- Crystal clear audio thanks to noise-cancelling mic  
- Long battery life with quick charge options  

**Bad Points**  
- Not water-resistant, so don’t wear it near your morning coffee spill zones  
- Plastic material may feel less premium to some users  
- Lacks more comprehensive integration with gaming systems if that's your thing  

**Competing Products**  
While testing the Jabra Engage 65 Stereo, I couldn’t help but compare it to my past experience with the Plantronics Voyager Focus UC and the Sennheiser SDW 5066. Both competitors offer noise cancellation and wireless range, but here’s where the Engage 65 shines: its ability to manage two simultaneous device connections. The Sennheiser model does provide slightly more premium materials, but it falls short in the realm of user controls. As for the Plantronics Voyager, it has a bulkier design and a less intuitive charging base. If you’re looking for daily workhorse reliability, the Jabra Engage is tough to beat in that category.

**Affordable Quality**  
From a pricing perspective, this headset sits on the slightly premium end of the spectrum, but the features justify it.

A few days ago my wife was parked up at a local coffee shop in a designated parking space. Another car was reversing out and crashed into our back bumper, scraped along for a good metre before stopping, pulling forward a bit, then continuing to reverse out and drive off. The whole incident was caught by the coffee shops CCTV, which can clearly see through the car windscreen at the driver, the licence plate, and that our car was hit. They said they will give this to any police or insurer that asks.

We filed a police report. My wife got a text from a PC saying they have contacted the keeper of the vehicle requesting to know who was driving. If they dont reply in 28 days they said they will produce them to court for failing to inform.

We want to get the damage fixed, but don't want it to rocket our insurance premiums. The car belongs to my wife, but I am the main driver, and the insurance is in my name with her as a named driver. I've got 6 years NCB at the moment.

Am I best filing an insurance claim immediately? I'm assuming they will go after the driver of the other car and that I won't lose my NCB if it is found it is their fault?

The only other option I thought of was to get their details and take them to small claims, but who knows if/when I will find out who the driver was.",2,1757443655.0,drivingUK,5,1.0,False

I am looking to get advice on following things.

1. Knee or back of my knee pain
2. Help need reducing food noises
3. Help tracking food and healthy desserts and spicy food

A little background about me I broke my fibula bone last year December 20th and have been in bed for most of this year un-till may ,by then I was walking a little with out any support stick and then my kid (4yr old) asked me to play with him, which was tough as you know he is running all around the house backyard and park and I am just trying to catchup with him due to still recovering. that is when I told my self I need to get fit and better in order to play with him. I was 202 lbs .

Now I started to follow random diet I could get from GPT and use it to get advice for my workouts too slowly i was able to drop to 188lbs as of this morning and able to run a 5.1 mile as of this Sunday.

So the main problem is before even starting the workout losing the weight I am having pain behind my Knee this is specifically when I fold it (crossed leg when I sit down) and top open it , it feels like I am taring up something. I need help strengthening it or improving it.

2 . I am having really hard time with the thoughts of food in my mind All day everyday and specially when my family is cooking something which I know is tasty , only from smell I can tell the food is tasty and I don't know how to resist my self from not eating it, I tried going for run every time they cook something good but let's be real I can not do that 3 times a day. also i tried eating a spoonful just to satisfy my craving but I end up giving in and digging in which will disperse everything i worked for. Also if I try eating something i just keep eating all day.

3 I am really just mixing random food and making it a meal to get fiber and protein in as I am a vegetarian and eats only egg for protein there's not much I am able to get and I am not able to track properly with the app's they all want some money which i seriously don't have( as you can see I am not working, still looking for a job)

Also at my current time this is my food schedule and what I am usually eating please add your thought and critics everything is welcomed

Morning 10:00 coffee 1:00 DR.Pepper at around 4 I usually have creating with water and at 6 i go for a run or weight exercise and then at 8:00 i consume beans (canned ) cabbage steam boiled, with yogurt in a bowl with avocado and onion and then salt pepper lemon garlic powder and then red hot sauce to taste and blend it with a jalapeno in it makes mee feel like I am having a spicy ranch with beans (i mix all kind ) then I have a protein shake and a cucumber to this meal. I am able to survive un-till I don't eat anything but the moment I put some food in my mouth its like it has a brain of its own and I am no longer in control.

I would really appreciate any and all help. thanks.",1,1757443504.0,1200isplenty,0,1.0,False
1ncra5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1ncra5i/my_girlfriends_mother_forced_my_gf_to_break_up/,My girlfriends mother forced my gf to break up with me,"Soo...my GF(26) and i met in college and in june 2021 we begun our relationship. In avgust i allready met her parents and we were together on a family holiday. Her parents got to know me (my gf told me i had to shave because her mother doesnt like beards). We were in the last year of bachelor and had plans to do masters later. I was working every weekend in a casino as a croupier (dealer) which i was proud of and i had to work beside college because i had to pay for my car, insurance and everything. My gf didnt work as her parents were pay for her (thats normal here, not a lot of people work while in college at least while it a semester)...fast forward....my gf graduted a bit earlier and she went to masters on year before me. Later in december we moved in together in an apartmant. Sometime that time when she went home to visit her parents, her mother asked her if i was gonna be dealing cards for whole of my life. Her mother knew that im in college and study for different job and that was just a side job which helped me and i was really good paid. I thought its kinda dissrespectfull to say that and was shocked a little, this was kinda the first flag i got. She told me that she told her mother that is just a side job and so on but her mother just stayed quiet. Ok everything was good...we were living together, 2 month later i also gratuted. They congratulate me and so on. Then i had half a yeat off until my masters would start. So while my GF was studying i had enough time so got a second job. I was wokring 2 jobs for like 6 months. I like to work and im not lazy. Later my gf also got a job for holidays and we were both working and had good time together and living. She rarely went home because it was on the other side of the country. We went together and visited and went again on family vacation with her family. She has a 10 younger brother and i understood that she wanted to go home and to be with her little brother it was never a problem to me, even tho i want to go on a holiday just the two of us but we could't because we only had time for one vacation because of work. On those family vacation and also visit to her parents were kinda anoxius for me. Im a sport man, i dont smoke, noone in my family smokes, and like to go for a walk and do something....so did my gf when were we together but at her home it was different...they all smoke, they sit for a few hours straight,,,,talk here and there and smoke and drink coffe all the time...it was really boring for me and it was kinda hard...i also dont drink coffee...i dont need to..i can function without it. Also on vacation 70% of the vacation was just siting, smoking and drinking coffe. I said to my gf can we go alone somewhere or do something and she said her mother doesnt like that we watch a movie in our room or something. So we were together all the time and like baby siting her brother (he is 16 now)....well fast forward again...when the college year started and i started my masters....my GF went home for a visit again without me and her mother told her that she think i went to studying masters just that we can still be in an apartment and together (i was thinking about doing masters way before i even met my gf).....so when i heard that i was shocked again like for that casino thing. Ok...everything was ok....every holiday like easter, Christmass....we were allways with her family and never with mine...i understood because of her little brother but still....i said 2 years in a row for a new year that ill work in casino...but then didnt but i was happy to be with my parents for at least on holiday. She was with hers all the time...but we understood...we didnt argue about that. Her mother didtn like it that i work nightshifts and also for new year....well job is job. She was allways against nightshifts....now she is wokring them also...kinda ironic. Anyway last summer they came with a camper on holday to us where we lived...it was our last month in that apartment becuase we finished all semesters and my gf was waiting for a different job and we said we are gonna go home to each amily for the summer. That week was the same again...siting. smoking...coffee...we couldnt enjoy our last week by the sea...we aleast i didnt. Then we went home to her family and we were siting and talking. With her mothers partner and son we were talking about out dream cars and well i said that i like skoda octavia rs and taht it costs 40k€. And that its possible to get it whike having a lising. All my friends have cars on a lising. The next day i had to go home i had work...when we were saying goodbyes....i went to her mother (we allways hugged)...i was going to hug her...was looking for her eye contact and she was looking just to the right like she didnt want to look at me...after a bit she did and hugged me. Then she said they are gonna marry her daugther here and someone is interested (as a joke)...to me that didnt seem like a joke...why would you say that. It was soo wierd and i was kinda pissed, felt dissrespected. She even laughed. Ok i went home...a few day later my GF told me her mother was soo pissed about that car, that im not mature enough, that i dont know how money works and so on.....i was surprised a little...like i didnt said i will buy it...it was just a thought...a few weeks later my GF send me a message that she got that job (we were waiting because we didnt know if she will get it and where we would live) ....so she told me she got the job i was really happy and then she said but theres one thing....her mother said we cant move in together because she didnt finish her masters that year and that happened because of me. And that her daugher was paying for the whole apartment for the to of us and that i was saving money for that car. I was in a total shock. Where did this come from...there we never any problems about money my and my gf were allways 50/50 and i was working to jobs...i paid everything myself. It was really a wow effect. I told my gf that she needs to talk with her and we both know its not true. They talked and we colud move in together but her mother told her i need to show every month that i really gave money. I felt so dissrespect....its my money im working hard for that. A month later...our casino closed and i became jobless. That became at a surprse for the whole firm but well that happens. I was searching for a job for 2 months...its hard to get it and i was searching for what i wanted to work and make a carrer out of it. They were searching for an aparment...they didnt ask me to come and we will look together...they found one and went to look and her mother said to me you can say yes and move in or you cant come here anymore. That apartment was too expensive...like 800€ for 26m2....i didnt like it. And i didnt know if i can say yes,...i wanted to of course beacuse of my gf but i didnt have a job. Well i said yes...and later found a job. (when we were still in previous apartment me and my gf were talking about what kind of aparment we want next) well this talk went through the window...it was nothing like that...it was wierd. Did her mother made her mind different for that 2 months she was at home or what...it was wierd. We came to sign the papers...there was a table missing for eating. That was still when i was jobless and her mother have me 200€ and made that table a priority. Like that table is more important than for me to find a job. I was soo pissed. I told my gf that her parents are too much involved and i dont have any say in anything. It like im moving in with her family not us. They choose everything for me that I will be paying it at the end of the day. That was just me telling my GF....she showed this to her parents (she still dont know why she did it)....her parents were ofcourse fuming. Later next month we moved in together. It was bad mood...we barely talked...then my gf started craying and said the her parents told her that i need to move out of the apartment. That im not a father material, im not serious enough and so on....i was in shock again...how low under the belt can you go and say to someone who doesnt have kids yet that he will be a bad father....well i said ok but i paid so im gonna be in until the last of month. She cryed everyday, talked to her mother she was fighting. Then her mother gave her an ultimatum its me or them and i had to go out of the apartment. She choose them, because at the end of the day family is all you have thats what she said to me. I was allways polite, helping...we were 3,5 years together. And allways her mother told that to my GF never said anything to me through chat or in person or anything. A month later...when i was still in the apartment...they invited me her brothers Catholic event....i said yes after everything....my gf went home on thursday and came on friday because i could get off on friday...that was a problem for her mother. I came to them i sat down i apologized for everything...they didnt apologize to me. Her mother just said that she will think about it if she will choose to take my apologize. That sounded to me like...she just invited me so i apologize and she will get her right she never wanted to take it. Fast forward...for a week everything was allright and smiles....then for a weekend my gf went home again...and on sunday she told me a had to move out. Her mother said so and we need to break up. Her mother said that i didnt open the windows when i woke up and that i didnt put the plates in the sink when i was there...(they never said i can feel at home there and do that kinda stuff)....and that i came a day after my gf and we didnt came together.....o and when i didnt yet know if im gonna move in beacuse i didnt had a job...they said that i dont love her enough...

  
One things is right...im noot a cook..but that was never a problem...my gf liked cooking so she cooked all the time...i allways cleaned up then and didt the chores more and so on....it was allways 50/50 and i told at the event to her mother that i dont know how to dance which i know but i was anoxius and i had a bad migrane for a whole month and for a MR i was scared i had a tumor. But i didnt told that to her mother so i just said i dont know who to dance. I was trying to learn who to cook tho. Im allways trying to better myself.

I currently commute by car 3 days a week 1 hour each way, so I’m out of the house for 10 hours on my in office days.

1ncr3ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1ncr3ok/explore_if_blueland_dishwasher_detergent_tablets/,Explore if Blueland Dishwasher Detergent Tablets Truly Deliver Clean,"Testing the Blueland TAB-AZ-60P-AD dishwasher detergent tablets in my daily routine has been an enlightening experience. As someone who juggles a busy schedule and desperately wants to make eco-conscious decisions, I was curious about how effective a product like this would be. I mean, it's not every day you see a detergent tablet that claims to be 100% plastic-free, eco-friendly, and free & clear, all while promising sparkling results. Naturally, I had to dive right in and see if these tablets could become a staple in my household.

**Design and Eco-Friendly Approach**

What initially drew me to these dishwasher tablets was their sustainable approach. There's literally no plastic involved here, including the packaging. This is a huge relief, as I’ve grown increasingly wary of single-use plastics cluttering my purchases. The box is recyclable, and the tablets themselves come naked — no individual wrappers made of PVA, which many standard dishwasher pods contain. This sets them apart as a pioneer in sustainable dishwashing. I’ve got to hand it to Blueland for being pretty bold in showing that efficiency can meet environmental responsibility.

**Performance in Real-Life Scenarios**

I hate pre-rinsing dishes; it’s a pain and feels counterproductive when you're about to toss them in a high-tech dishwasher anyway. These tablets claim to lift 48-hour baked-on foods with their 2x enzyme power—challenge accepted. During my testing, I stuffed my washer with grimy casserole dishes, coffee-stained cups, and plates generously coated with dried-on sauces. True to the claims, everything came out spotless, even some of my wine glasses. The oxi stain-fighting action worked wonders on tea residue in ceramic mugs, something many other tablets have struggled with in the past.

**Check [Blueland TAB-AZ-60P-AD] price on Amazon.**

**Ease of Use**

Using these dishwasher detergent tablets is as simple as it gets. Just pop one of the tablets into the detergent compartment, and that's it. No fumbling with slippery individual wrappers, no need for measuring powders or gels. Given that the formula is microplastic-free and septic-safe, it’s comforting knowing those harsh residues aren’t making their way into my home or the environment. Plus, it handles hard water issues surprisingly well, tackling any spotting or filming that usually plagues my dishwasher sessions.

**Benefits**

- 100% plastic-free for a genuinely eco-conscious choice  
- 2x enzyme power effortlessly tackles baked-on food and stains  
- Easy to use without the hassle of additional steps  
- Clean, plant-based ingredients safe for family use  
- Certified EPA Safer Choice, Vegan, and Cruelty-Free  

**Disadvantages**

- Tablets aren’t individually wrapped, which means they need to be kept in a moisture-free space  
- Some users report mixed results for extremely greasy pans (though I didn’t face this issue personally)  

**Cleaning Power vs. Competitors**

Compared to mainstream pods like Cascade Platinum or Finish Quantum, where packaging is a bit more wasteful, these tablets have a clear edge for someone aiming for environmental sustainability. While the mainstream brands might handle heavy grease a tad better, the Blueland dishwasher tablets balance eco-friendly qualities with solid performance. I also found that Blueland stood out specifically for its transparency about ingredients, unlike other giants that often veil their formulas in vague chemical terms. If you're someone like me, who favors a product that does good outside the home as much as it does inside, these tablets win major points.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of value, the product holds its own. While it’s not the cheapest on the market, the commitment to reducing environmental impact and ensuring a family-safe formula justifies the cost.

That was weird enough cause he never did something like that and when i asked him what he was doing he began to act really suspicious. He started to apologize and stuff. After being persistent for 10min he finally showed me what he was doing and he also admitted that he was watching other men masturbating on cam. He claims that he didnt show himsellf but at this point i dont know what to think. I just walked out and continued cooking cause I was too angry to talk. What do y'all think?

I Fired My Husband On Our Anniversary Novel: Full Story Uploaded Link In Comments,"# Chapter 1 Link : [https://writers.hubofcards.com/special-one-1/](https://writers.hubofcards.com/special-one-1/) Chapter 1 

On our fifth anniversary, I opened Jason Locke’s personal safe only to find an old phone.\[\] 

The password was, of course, his first love Yvonne Yates’s birthday.\[\] 

All their past sweetness–every message, every photo–was right there, while his current phone held not one single picture of 

1. me. 

“Lydia, snooping through my past–is it fun?” 

I turned to the man in the doorway–no yelling, no drama. 

I simply said, “Divorce.“\]\] 

He walked over, took the phone from my hands, and factory–reset it right in front of me, his expression flat and emotionless. 

“Happy now? Still wanna divorce?” 

I looked him straight in the eye and nodded. “Divorce.“\] 

“Enough already. Quit being dramatic.” 

Jason frowned, clearly annoyed. 

“Be a good girl–when this project ends up at the end of the year, I’ll take you to Aspen to see the snow.” 

I stayed quiet. Jason pulled that familiar careless smirk and tapped my forehead || 

“I’m not messing with you this time. Really.” 

I almost laughed. He wasn’t messing with me this time, which only made it worse. He knew damn well he’d been lying all along.\]\] 

That Aspen trip had been pushed back year after year. Every movie date, I was left standing outside the theater alone until showtime. Every time he swore he’d pick me up, leaving me soaked in the rain without a trace of his car. Every. Single. Promise. Jason ever made was Broken.\[\] 

And now he acted like saying this shit was some kind of reward. 

“Don’t bother.” I drew in a steady breath. “Jason, I want a divorce.“\] 

His expression went ice cold. He had completely lost his patience.\]\] 

“Lydia, you’re being ridiculous. 

“Go to Aspen or don’t, I don’t care. I already gave you a chance.“\] 

“Don’t come back crying that I didn’t do what I said.“\] 

He grabbed his jacket, headed for the door, not even touching the anniversary dinner I’d spent hours preparing just the way he 

liked it.\[\] 

I stayed silent. For the first time, I didn’t try to make him stay–not even a minute longer.\] 

Jason paused at the door, glanced back, and saw me already seated, picking up my fork and taking a bite, as if he wasn’t even there. He slammed the door behind him, letting his anger out.\] 

My heart stopped hurting long ago. Now there was only quiet. 

I used to think Jason was too refined for ordinary things, too sophisticated for simple pleasures. But he cooked for the girl he loved, just to hear one nice word from her. Those cuts on his hands, the burns from the stove–they were trophies of love. 

He even said the most childish romantic shit: “Cooking for someone you love makes you feel so damn good.” 

“I’m gonna cook for Yvonne forever, fatten her up so nobody else will want her.” 

Reading all that made me see it clearly for the first time: I was a complete joke. 

The next day, I met my bestie Sophia Mitchell at a coffee shop to draft the divorce papers. 

“What the hell happened? This seems serious. 

Tm exhausted, Sophia.” I stared at the busy street. “She’s back.“\] 

Just that one word, and Sophia knew. Yvonne. Jason’s first love. 

Her name was like a tiny needle in my heart–never bleeding, always hurting. Five years, and she had been messing with my life the entire time.\]\] 

Jason preached personal space, yet they shared a Spotify account. He hated public exposure, yet his old social media was littered with her traces. 

He took me to an art gallery, but it was her favorite artist. Shopping with me was a waste of time, while he spent entire weekends with her hitting every antique market in the city. 

We had been together for five years–two years dating, three years married–and he had never truly removed her from his heart. I had only been his companion during that time, just a habit, a second choice. 

\*Fine. I’ll handle the divorce papers and make damn sure he doesn’t pull any crap on you.“\] 

Sophia frowned. “But are you really sure about this?” 

“I’ve been telling you forever–he’s all wrong for you. His heart’s never been clear, and you’ve been selling yourself short staying with him.” 

“But you still went and fell for him, didn’t listen to a damn thing I said.“\] 

I stirred my coffee and looked up. “I will never make myself small for 

anyone again.”

Anyone else get this?

I've been experiencing this deep sense of ""go do something"" -- almost like anxiety or disquietude. Nothing feels wrong per se. I've had coffee. I'm also working on an extremely dull project, tech related, that is simply not what I want to do at the moment, but rather need to do, to stay in good standing with my job.

I have like 8 other projects on my desk--far more creative--that i'm dying to chomp my teeth into. So this could all be related to boredom, but it feels different.

It's an urge to help people and connect.

1ncqx2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ncqx2a/passion_and_ponies_novel_by_tara_sivec_free_read/,Passion and Ponies Novel by Tara Sivec Free Read online," My eyes suddenly jerk open when I feel the subtle shaking of my bed. For a minute, my sleep-addled brain wonders if we’re having an earthquake and panic sets in. Then I remember I live in Ohio and the house is probably not preparing to crumble down around me. As my eyes adjust to the darkness in my childhood bedroom, I listen intently for sounds of heavy breathing or the distinct metallic clang of a knife sharpening, certain the shaking of my bed is a not-so-stealthy axe murderer preparing to slit my throat.  
  
  What? That could totally happen. Some dude could have broken into my parent’s home and now he’s sitting on the edge of my bed, sharpening his giant knife.  
  
  I hold my breath in fear. I begin to slowly turn my head and prepare to come face-to-face with a homicidal maniac when something kicks the back of my leg with the force of a two-by-four.  
  
  “Ouch! Son of a bitch!” I shout as I quickly flop over in bed. Unfortunately, I don’t come face-to-face with a killer. What I do find in my bed next to me is much worse.  
  
  “Tyler! What the fuck are you still doing in my bed?” I whisper-yell, hoping my initial outburst didn’t wake my parents, who are sleeping down the hall.  
  
  Tyler Branson, man-child extraordinaire and the guy I’ve been shame fucking for the past few months, doesn’t even bat an eye at me. I listen in irritation as he lightly snores and watch as his legs jerk forward every couple of seconds. Pretty soon, his arms join in, reminding me of those stupid YouTube videos of dogs dreaming that they’re running.  
  
  Almost immediately, a sound that can only be described as a whinny passes his lips as his arms and legs move at a faster pace, my bed bouncing with the force of his movements.  
  
  Oh, my God. Oh, sweet mother of Mary...  
  
  Reaching for my bedside table, I quickly turn on my lamp even though seeing Tyler swathed in any kind of lighting right now makes me want to puke. This is an image I don’t want burned into my brain.  
  
  With my face scrunched up in disgust, I reach around his flailing arms and punch him in the chest. His eyes fly open in fear and he bolts up in bed, scrambling backwards until his back hits the headboard.  
  
  “What is it? What happened?” he asks frantically as he rubs the sleep from his eyes.  
  
  “What the hell were you doing?” I demand.  
  
  His eyes zone right in on my braless chest covered in a tank top. I quickly pull the sheet up to my chin and give him a dirty look.  
  
  “I was sleeping. What the hell did you wake me up for?” he complains.  
  
  “You kicked me and made a horse noise.”  
  
  He stares at me blankly for a moment before scoffing at me in disbelief and sliding back down the bed until his head hits the pillow again.  
  
  “I was having a dream. Now leave me alone and let me go back to sleep.”  
  
  When he rolls over, I shove my hand against his back. “Were you dreaming about horses? You were fucking prancing in your sleep.”  
  
  Tyler looks over his shoulder at me and I watch his face redden with embarrassment. “What? You’re delusional. I don’t prance. I NEVER prance.”  
  
  I just shake my head at him. “You were totally prancing in your sleep. Prancing and whinnying like a damn horse.”  
  
  “You shut your face! Shut your face right now!” he shouts.  
  
  I shove my finger close to his nose. “No, YOU shut your prancing face, Twilight Sparkle, before my parents hear you. You’re not even supposed to BE here. You were supposed to sneak out of my bedroom window just like always. Get out of my bed!”  
  
  He huffs in irritation and angrily flings the blankets off of him before getting out of bed. My already black soul dies a little more inside when I can’t tear my eyes away from his perfect ass and his chiseled abs as he pulls his clothes on, muttering under his breath the entire time.  
  
  This was never supposed to happen. Sleeping with Tyler was supposed to be a one-time thing – a means of scratching an itch and quelling the boredom that has consumed my life lately. The first time we had sex and he sang the theme song from My Little Pony while he went down on me should have sent me running for the hills like my ass was on fire. He’s immature, he constantly pisses me off and he’s twenty-five years old and can’t hold down a job to save his life.  
  
  But dammit, sex with Tyler was the biggest high I’ve ever had in my life.  
  
  It’s official: I am clinically insane.  
  
  I am twenty-one-years old and I hate my life. Okay, maybe hate is a strong wo  
rd. I’m dissatisfied. I took a leave of absence from college because wasting my parents’ money when I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life was pointless. I’ve been working at my mother’s company, Seduction and Snacks, as an administrative assistant for the past few months and hating every minute of it. My mother co-owns the business with her best friend Claire. Mom’s side is the Seduction half of the equation. They sell all things sex from toys, porn and games to lingerie and costumes. Claire operates the Snacks side, where they make the best damn baked goods ever to hit the Midwest. Sounds amazing, right? I should love the fact that my family has made a small fortune over the years and that Seduction and Snacks is now located in twenty-eight states throughout the U.S. I should also enjoy working in the family business and take pride in the fact that my mother and my Aunt Claire started building this empire when they were only a few years older than me.  
  
  Maybe that’s my problem. They were my age when they came up with this idea and they made it a reality only three years later. I don’t have any earth shattering, groundbreaking ideas. I have nothing that’s just mine alone, except a fashion blog where I talk about clothes and purses and other things that interest me. I’m expected to work at Seduction and Snacks and continue living their dream. It’s not my dream, though. I have no fucking clue what my dream is aside from finding a good sale at Nordstrom’s for those Michael Kors wedge pumps I’ve had my eye on.  
  
  Which brings us back to Tyler. And no, he’s not my fucking dream either! He’s just a way to keep my mind off of the fact that I’m in my early twenties and clueless about where my life is going. Obviously, it’s going nowhere fast with Tyler and I need to nip this thing in the bud immediately.  
  
  Tyler pulls his shirt down over his head and I pretend like I’m not sad to see his naked abs go.  
  
  “I can’t believe you’re kicking me out at three-o’clock in the morning,” he grumbles as he slides his feet into tennis shoes without bothering to tie them.  
  
  He walks over to my window and slides it open, looking back at me and smirking. “So, same time, same place tomorrow?”  
  
  Rolling my eyes, I shake my head. “No. Absolutely not. We’re not doing this anymore. Leave and don’t come back.”  
  
  He’s got one leg swung over the windowsill and his body halfway out before he jerks his head back inside and stares at me in surprise. “What? What do you mean ‘don’t come back’? Like, don’t come back tomorrow, or ever?”  
  
  Seriously, how can he be so dense?  
  
  “Ever. This was a huge mistake.”  
  
  He actually has the nerve to growl at me. Thank God he didn’t whinny or I’d be puking right into my lap.  
  
  “Fine! But you’ll be begging for another piece of Tyler, mark my words!”  
  
  “Jesus Christ, don’t talk about yourself in third person,” I complain.  
  
  “They come back, they always come back to Tyler,” he mutters with another smirk, completely ignoring me.  
  
  “By ‘they’, I’m assuming you’re talking about the ponies you were dreaming about?” I chuckle.  
  
  “Fuck your face! Fuck your face right now!” he demands.  
  
  “Get the hell out of my bedroom and don’t come back, Prancer!” I fire back.  
  
  Sticking his tongue out at me in one poorly-executed, last ditch effort to put me in my place, he tries to smoothly exit my window but his head smacks against the frame. He lets go of the sill to grab his wounded head and loses his balance, falling out the window and into the shrubs on the other side.  
  
  “Mother fucking dick fuck ass cake piece of shit shrub!” I hear him whisper from the yard.  
  
  Getting out of bed, I rush over to the window, slam it closed and secure the lock. I climb back into bed, turn off my light and try to think about anything other than Tyler Branson and his stupid tongue.  
  
  I can totally quit Broke Back Moron, piece of cake.  
  
  “My life is over,” I wail, plopping myself down in the chair across from Gavin’s desk.  
  
  He looks up from his computer and cocks his head. “So you got fired from The Gap? You didn’t like that job anyway.”  
  
  I stare at him in confusion and shake my head sadly. “I’m sorry, have we met? Who gives a shit about The Gap? I’m talking about Ava. I’m pretty sure she’s not going to have sex with me anymore.”  
  
  In all honesty, I am kind of pissed about getting fired. It’s not like working at The Gap was a dream job, but it paid for porn and strip clubs so it had some perks. I gave those assholes two of the best months of my life and what do they do? Get audited by corporate and tell me the copy of my birth certificate I gave them when they hired me was a fake. As if!  
  
  “I thought you couldn’t stand Ava?” Gavin asks in confusion.  
  
  “I can’t. All she does is bitch at me. But man alive, that chick’s got a mouth like a Shop Vac.”  
  
  Gavin winces and mimics dry heaving. “Seriously dude, stop. Just stop.”  
  
  Gavin and I have been best friends ever since we met our freshman year in college. It’s unfortunate that I was naked during that first meeting, but what can you do? Sometimes the boys just like to dangle while you’re hanging pictures around your dorm room. Anyway, as soon as we got to talking (after I put pants on), I knew this was a guy I wanted in my corner. He’s a good-looking dude, so he’s always had a plethora of hot chicks sniffing around him. Lucky for me, he’s been in love with Charlotte, his childhood sweetheart, since birth and I, therefore got all his castoffs.  
  
  Some dudes would probably be offended at being the second-best choice. Those dudes are obviously dumb fucks who don’t know rule number one in the guy handbook - you never, ever turn down pussy. Gavin’s feelings towards Charlotte are obviously not brotherly, but he’s always looked at Ava as a little sister. Needless to say, talk about our sexcapades grosses him the fuck out.  
  
  “I guess I shouldn’t let it get to me. I mean, how can I bang a chick that has no appreciation for animals?” I ask in irritation as I kick my feet up on his desk.  
  
  “I’m pretty sure Ava loves animals. I think the problem is that she didn’t expect to sleep with one,” Gavin replies with a smirk.  
  
  I knew I shouldn’t have told him about that whole horse incident the other night.  
  
  “So what’s on the agenda today, dick licker? Are we going to watch some chicks masturbate, maybe construct a mold of my penis for a new sex toy?” I ask, quickly moving the conversation away from my embarrassing evening with Ava.  
  
  Gavin has worked in Product Development for Seduction and Snacks ever since graduating from college. Lucky bastard.  
  
  Shaking his head at me, he gets up from behind the desk and heads towards the door. “How many times do I have to tell you that no one masturbates inside this building?”  
  
  “And how many times do I have to tell you that I don’t like it when you lie to me and crush my dreams,” I remind him as I follow him out into the hall.  
  
  Luckily, Ava isn’t at her desk right outside Gavin’s office. She works part time as his secretary and I made sure to stop by today when she was on her lunch break. Actually, regardless of what time I stop by, chances of her ass being in that desk were miniscule. That chick is hot as fuck and the best lay I’ve ever had, but working is not her strong suit.  
  
  “Our tour guide for the warehouse was in a pretty bad car accident over the weekend, so I’m stuck taking over the tours until we can find a replacement,” Gavin explains as he pushes open the double doors to the warehouse.  
  
  I’ve strolled through the warehouse and even participated in a few tours, but each time I walk through those doors is like the first time. I swear as soon as I set foot in this place I can hear a choir of angels singing. As far as the eye can see, row after row, aisle after aisle, box after box – are sex toys. Metal shelving from floor to ceiling filled with boxes of beautifully crafted love machines.  
  
  I don’t even realize I’m mumbling until Gavin punches me in the arm.  
  
  “Were you just chanting ‘This is my home; this is where I belong’?”  
  
  I just shrug and fo  
llow him over to the first aisle, where a group of about ten women ranging in ages from twenty-five to sixty-five stand, anxiously awaiting their tour of Mecca.  
  
  “No talking, no crying, no sword fights with the dildos and please, for the love of God, do NOT lick the Chocolate Thunders on aisle twelve again,” Gavin warns me under his breath.  
  
  Is it my fault they named a sex toy after chocolate? How the fuck was I supposed to know it didn’t taste like chocolate? That’s false advertising, if you ask me.  
  
  “Ladies, welcome to Seduction and Snacks! My name is Gavin and I’m the head of Product Development. If you’ll just follow me, we can start the tour.”  
  
  “This one has slow pulses along with intense vibrations. It’s got an easy two-button functionality and you’ll be happy to know it’s made from durable, phthalate-free plastic. I would highly recommend this toy for any of you first-timers who just aren’t sure how to start when building your toy collection. It’s one of our most popular models and I guarantee you’ll enjoy it.”  
  
  Gavin was called away from the tour a half hour ago for an emergency conference call. I felt bad for all these bitches standing around waiting for him, so I figured I might as well carry on with the tour.  
  
  Placing the toy back into its bin on the shelf on aisle fourteen, I look up from the crowd of women surrounding me and see Gavin and his Aunt Liz standing at the edge of the group. Gavin is smiling and Liz has a look of complete shock on her face.  
  
  I excuse myself from the group, leaving them to chat amongst themselves as I make my way to Gavin and Liz.  
  
  “What the fuck was that?” Liz asks as soon as I reach her.  
  
  Awwww shit, now I’m in trouble. I should have just wandered over to the flavored lube on aisle seven and had a snack. The funnel cake flavored lube really is quite filling.  
  
  “That was the Eighth Wonder of the World. You know, one of the toys you sell here?” I remind her.  
  
  I barely finish my sentence when her hand flies out and smacks me up side the head. “I’m well aware of toy’s name, dick face. I meant, how did you know so much about it? You sounded like you could have written the fucking product description for it.  Oh, is that all?  
  
  “Well, I’m kind of a connoisseur of sex toys, if you will. I like to keep myself informed for the ladies. A happy vagina is a happy life,” I tell her with a smile.  
  
  “Eeew, that’s disgusting,” Liz complains. “I can’t believe I was actually thinking about giving you a job.”  
  
  Gavin’s face lights up and he turns to face her. “Seriously? Aunt Liz, that would be awesome! Finally, something better than that stupid clothing store.”  
  
  I gasp, placing my hand over my heart. “That hurts, Gavin, that really hurts. Have you ever taken off all of your clothes and curled up in a box of cotton blend t-shirts? It’s like floating on a cloud.”  
  
  “Forget I said anything,” Liz mutters, turning to walk away from us.  
  
  Gavin grabs her arm, forcing her to stop. “Wait, Aunt Liz, just hear me out. Tyler might be an idiot, but he really does know a shit ton about our products. He could recite the specifications for everything we carry in his sleep.”  
  
  Liz raises an eyebrow and looks at me.  
  
  “It’s true. I’ve been known to talk about twirling beads, rotating shafts and cock rings during a night of peaceful slumber,” I admit.  
  
  “Oh my God, this is the worst idea in the history of the world. I must be high,” Liz mutters.  
  
  “Hey, what a coincidence, so am I!” I tell her with a smile.  
  
  Gavin punches me in the arm and I scowl at him.  
  
  “I cannot believe I’m actually considering this,” Liz sighs. “Here’s the deal. I just found out that our guy who usually gives the tours won’t be coming back. He hurt his knee pretty bad in the accident and he’s not going to be able to stand for the long periods of time that tours require. Right now, I just need someone to fill in until we make a more permanent decision. You have to be friendly, informative and you absolutely CANNOT have sex with anyone on the tour.”  
  
  “Fuck it, I’m out,” I complain.  
  
  That earns me another smack from Gavin. Seriously, does he really expect me to work in a sex toy warehouse, playing with toys all day long and not have sex with anyone? I wonder if that includes myself. It better not include myself, that’s just wrong.  
  
  “He’ll take the job,” Gavin answers for me.  
  
  And just like that, I’m a working man again.  
  
  “YOU DID WHAT?!”  
  
  I realize my voice might be a little high when my mother winces and covers her ears. But seriously, she must be joking.  
  
  “Please tell me you did NOT hire Tyler to work at Seduction and Snacks. Are you insane?” I ask, abandoning the email on my iPhone announcing a seventy-percent off sale on Coach purses that I should be writing a blog post about right now. Only something this insane could tear my eyes away from the new coral colored Peyton leather satchel.  
  
  It’s so pretty I want to pet it.  
  
  “According to the doctors, no, I am not insane. Borderline, with homicidal tendencies towards my children, but that’s understandable,” she replies with a smile.  
  
  Before I completely lose it and start throwing a hissy fit, I should probably warn you that my mom, Liz, is not like other moms. She says whatever she thinks and has no filter. We have an unconventional relationship in that she doesn’t hesitate to call my sisters or me assholes and my sisters and I are content to continue acting like assholes just to get her riled up. Sometimes it’s fun to watch my mom lose her shit. She’s obviously determined to turn the tables today.  
  
  It’s no secret that my mother doesn’t really like Tyler, which makes it even more alarming that she actually hired him to work for her company. I don’t even like Tyler. I’m still trying to figure out why in the hell I ever slept with him in the first place. And then repeated that mistake. Eighteen times.  
  
  “You have to fire him. Immediately. Tell him you made a mistake or something,” I beg.  
  
  There is no way I can go to work at that place every day knowing he’s going to be there. It’s bad enough he shows up unannounced all the time to hang out with Gavin; this would be much worse and make me hate that job more than I already do.  
  
  My mom rolls her eyes and takes a seat at the kitchen table. “If you’re going to continue sleeping with him, he needs a better job than folding sweaters at the mall.”  
  
  “I am NOT sleeping with him!” I argue, stomping my foot and putting my hands on my hips.  
  
  Technically, I’m not lying. I’m not sleeping with him right this second.  
  
  “Oh, please. I heard barnyard animal noises coming from your room the other night and someone shouting ‘Pull my reins, bitch!’ I realize you’re twenty-one-years old and theoretically an adult, but if I have to hear that shit one more time when I’m trying to sleep, I will beat you like a red-headed step child,” she warns.  
  
  Did I also mention my mom is sort of the coolest mom ever and has never threatened my life the many times she’s caught me having sex? She’s always been of the opinion that telling us not to do something will just make us want to do it even more. As soon as my sisters and I got our periods, she marched us down to the doctor, put us on the pill and gave us a lifetime supply of condoms.  
  
  Still, knowing she heard Tyler and I having sex makes me feel dirty.  
  
  “That must have been a movie I was watching in my room. I’ll make sure to keep the volume down from now on,” I tell her, attempting to lie.  
  
  She scoffs and rolls her eyes at me. “Really? A movie? So you’ve taken up watching horse porn now, have you? Actually, I think I’d rather you were watching horse porn than sleeping with Tyler.”  
  
  I ignore her and walk over to the counter to pour myself a cup of coffee.  
  
  “Mom, you can’t be serious about hiring Tyler to work at Seduction and Snacks. He never shows up for work on time and he’s got no work ethic,” I complain.  
  
  “And yet, I hired you, didn’t I?” she asks with a laugh.  
  
  “Oh, you’re hilarious.”  
  
  She’s right, but it still sucks to hear it. How can I possibly show up on time and be expected to work when I don’t care about what I’m doing? Shouldn’t you be passionate about your career? The only thing I’m passionate about is spending my paycheck on a new Coach purse.  
  
  Just then I hear the front door open and a shout from my sister, Charlotte. “Hello? Is anyone home?”  
  
  “We’re in the kitchen,” mom yells back.  
  
  Charlotte walks in the room and gives mom a kiss on the cheek before walking up to me and taking the coffee cup out of my hand. “What’s up, skank?”  
  
  “Nothing much, twat. I spit in that coffee, by the way,” I inform her as she takes a sip.  
  
  “So that’s why it tastes like rotten vagina,” she tells me with a smirk.  
  
  “There’s so much love in this room I almost can’t stand it,” mom adds, standing up from the table. “I have to run some errands. Play nice, you two. No fighting, no biting and no hair pulling. I still have bruises from the last time you two were alone in the same room together.”  
  
  I love my sister, but we have a tendency to butt heads a lot. We always make up right away and never hold grudges against one another, but we’ve been known to break a few pieces of furniture and one of us usually ends up bleeding. My mom says we’ve been that way since we were old enough to walk. Our very first fight happened when Charlotte was five and I was two. Charlotte handed me a cupcake she’d made out of Play-Doh and told me to eat it. Being two, I did it without question and promptly puked up the Play-Doh cupcake all down the front of my favorite princess costume. I walked right up to Charlotte and kicked her in the cooch wearing my tiny, black patent leather Mary Janes. I’d seen my Uncle Carter do it to my Uncle Drew and it seemed like it hurt pretty bad, so I figured it would work on Charlotte. My mom said she thought two cats were eating each other’s faces off by the sounds of the screams coming from our bedroom.  
  
  “So what’s new with you? Still sleeping with Tyler the Turkey?” Charlotte asks with a laugh.  
  
  I made the mistake of telling Charlotte a little secret about something Tyler does whenever I’m giving  
him a blow job. Tyler is a talker in bed, and when I’m going down on him, it’s even worse. He likes to coordinate said talking with whatever holiday is closest. The blow job in question was right before Thanksgiving. Tyler really got into the spirit of things, gobbling like a turkey while I had his dick in my mouth and yelling out “Yeah, baby! Suck on those giblets.”  
  
  Do you see now why I kicked him out of my bed the other night? How can I possibly continue to sleep with someone who refers to his balls as turkey organs?  
  
  “I thought we agreed to never speak of that again? And no, I’m not sleeping with him anymore. I gave him the boot and told him to never come back,” I tell her, pouring myself another cup of coffee.  
  
  “Didn’t you tell him you would never sleep with him again after he told you to lick his little pumpkins on Halloween?” Charlotte laughs.  
  
  “Fuck off,” I mutter. “Change of subject. How’s married life?”  
  
  Charlotte rolls her eyes. “Shut up. We’re not married.”  
  
  “You’re living in sin and finish each other’s sentences – close enough. It’s cute and disgusting all at the same time. He’s probably going to propose on Christmas.”  
  
  Her eyes widen and her mouth drops open. “Oh, my God. Do you think he will? No, there’s no way! It’s too soon! We’ve only been living together for a few months. Holy shit, what if he does? What should I wear?”  
  
  It’s my turn to roll my eyes. She’s so giddy and in love that it makes me want to punch her in the throat. I’m happy for her and Gavin, I really am. They have been friends since birth due to the fact that our parents are best friends and we all grew up together. A few months ago, they each decided it was time to admit their true feelings about one another. They both went about it the wrong way, making a list of ways to prove their love to each other instead of just coming right out and saying it. Charlotte’s gay best friend pretended to be her boyfriend and Gavin pretended he was dating some bat shit crazy ex-girlfriend of his who wound up beating the shit out of a dude in the bar one night and calling him a Vaginaman. It was a hot mess, but it all ended well. They’ve been shacking up for the last few months and they work at Seduction and Snacks together. It’s so perfect I want to gouge my eyes with a fork.  
  
  I’m woman enough to admit that I’m a little bit jealous. My only prospect for love is a man who lights his farts on fire and has a membership to a porn-of-the-month club. I really need to get back into the dating world and forget about Tyler once and for all.  
  
  “I’ll take you shopping for the perfect proposal outfit, and I’ll even buy it for you if you help me find a man,” I tell her.  
  
  Even though Charlotte and I fight a lot, we still have one thing in common – our love of shopping. Her eyes light up at the idea of going to the mall and she holds out her hand.  
  
  I grab onto it and we shake, making a deal.  
  
  “Done. I have the perfect guy in mind for you. Don’t make any plans for tomorrow night. Do you have something slutty to wear?”  
  
  She looks me up and down, focusing on the tight, low-cut shirt I’m wearing that barely contains my boobs and the short, pleated skirt that stops right below my ass that I paired with black, knee-high stiletto boots.  
  
  “Never mind. I see you’ve already been shopping at Sluts R Us.”  
  
  She leaves me no choice but to wrap my arm around her neck and put her in a choke hold.  
  
  “Goddammit, cut it out, asshole!” she yells at me as I bend over, taking her down with me.  
  
  She begins smacking my legs and I start pulling her hair, both of us screaming and cursing.  
  
  “STOP BEING SUCH A BITCH! I CAN’T BELIVE YOU-hey, is this the new Mossimo Pointe Stripe jacket?” I ask, pausing to pull the tag out of the neck of Charlotte’s coat.  
  
  “Yes! I got it on sale at Target. Isn’t it cute?” she asks, her head still down by my waist as I read the tag.  
  
  “You should have paired it with some skinny Seven jeans and those black Steve Madden pumps you wore to the DMV in August,” I tell her, finally releasing my stranglehold so she can stand.  
  
  She smoothes down her hair that was mussed during our tussle and stares at me like I’m crazy. “How is it that you can precisely recall what I wore three months ago but you can’t remember how to use the photocopier at work?”  
  
  I shrug, turning away from her to grab my keys off of the counter. “It’s not that I’m incapable of remembering how that machine works, I just choose NOT to remember. It’s boring.”  
  
  “What was I wearing when we went to the Pink concert?” she asks.  
  
  “September 23rd? You had on a black Max and Mia drawstring waist dress with nude, Valentino couture bow platform pumps,” I reply as I head out of the kitchen and towards the front door.  
  
  “October 15th?” she asks, following me outside towards my car.  
  
  “J Brand skinny stretch jeans, black Stuart Weitzman knee boots and a fitted, emerald green Donna Karan ¾ length t-shirt,” I rattle off easily as I unlock my doors.  
  
  Charlotte stands next to the passenger side door, staring over the top of the car at me in awe. “Jesus Christ, you’re like the Rain Man of fashion. Why the hell are you working at Seduction and Snacks? You should be taking over Nordstrom’s.”  
  
  I roll my eyes and laugh as we both get into the car.  
  
  “Believe me, if I could find a way to make money talking about clothes, shoes and purses, I would be all over that shit.”  
  
  As we head towards the mall, I try not to think about Tyler or how much I hate my job. Charlotte is going to set me up with a new guy and maybe my life will finally start looking up.  
  
  Dating world, here I come.  
  
  “I’d like to thank the Academy for this illustrious award,” I speak into the mirror in my room, straightening my imaginary tie. “I’m humbled that so many of my peers thought I was deserving of the Dapper Dildo Award.”  
  
  Do they give out awards at Seduction and Snacks? Eh, if they don’t now, I’m sure they will after I’ve been in their employ for a few weeks.  
  
  I can’t contain my excitement as I think about the fact that I have a real job. A real, honest to God job that I can be proud of and brag to people about on the street. I mean, The Gap was a pretty good gig - all the sweater vests I could handle and plenty of hot pieces of ass hitting on me every day. They were all gay dudes, but whatev. They appreciated a good thing when they saw it.  
  
  I’ve been trying to get my foot in the door at Seduction and Snacks ever since I found out Gavin’s family owned the business. I make sure to keep myself current on all things sex. I’ve committed to memory the name, cup size and favorite sexual position of every female porn star of the last decade. I’m an expert on all things fetish, from sacofricosis and ederacinism to mucophilia and oculolinctus. I’ve even volunteered on more than one occasion to be a human guinea pig for new Seduction and Snacks products. I have the organic plaster they were tinkering with for penis molds to thank for the fact that I couldn’t grow hair on my balls for three months. A few months of shiny, smooth balls were well worth the third degree burns I sustained on my taint when I tried to use a hair dryer to remove the plaster, especially if sacrificing a few pubes led to Liz realizing my full potential.  
  
  Maybe now that I have a good job, Ava will stop being such a bitch and sleep with me again. Grabbing my cell phone off of my dresser, I decide to shoot her a text and deliver the good news.  
  
  Hey there, loose labia. Wanna carpool in to work tomorrow? I’ll let you give me a blow job in the parking lot.  
  
  Satisfied that my news will thaw a little of the ice in her veins, I toss my phone back on my dresser and head upstairs to look for a good copy of my birth certificate.  
  
  Yes, I live in the basement of my parents’ home. I get twenty-eight cable channels, access to all the porn my dad still has on VHS and meatloaf every Thursday night. Seriously, why would I leave?  
  
  Opening the door at the top of the stairs that leads into the kitchen, I stop in my tracks when I see my dad sitting up on the counter with his feet in the sink and my mom stan  
ding next to him shaving his legs.  
  
  “Oh, hi, sweetie! Do you need the sink?” my mom asks, smiling brightly as she squirts some extra shaving cream on my dad’s shin.  
  
  Alright, maybe there’s at least one reason to move out and get my own place.  
  
  “Mom, seriously? I just ate lunch. Do you want me to puke all over the floor?” I ask disgustedly as I avoid looking directly at them.  
  
  “Tyler, studies have shown that a man and a woman who share simple, every day experiences like this will have a long and fruitful sex life,” my dad says, looking up from what my mom’s doing and pushing his glasses up higher on his face.  
  
  “I shaved your father’s balls for the first time when we were twenty-one and look at us now! We’re still going strong twenty-six years later and our love making is more passionate than ever,” my mom tells me with a smile.  
  
  Shaking my head at them, I keep my eyes averted as I head over to the built-in desk on the other side of the kitchen.  
  
  “I like the feel of smooth legs. I totally get why women have been doing this for centuries,” my dad adds.  
  
  Really, their behavior shouldn’t come as any surprise to me at this point. My parents, Donna and Nick Branson, are sex therapists. There was a time when I attributed my love of sex to their constant discussion of the topic, but now I worry all this “sharing” is going to one day seriously effect my ability to keep it up. Last week when I got home from work, I found them in the living room practicing their climax yells. Fully clothed, sitting on the couch, legs crossed like they were attending church services, screaming each other’s names in different pitches to see which one sounded the best.  
  
  Ignoring my parents’ giggles on the other side of the room, I dig through the desk drawers, tossing papers aside as I go. I grow more and more frustrated as I open drawer after drawer, and my parents’ laughter gets more and more intimate. I know if I don’t find what I’m looking for and get the fuck out of here, vegetables from the fridge will soon be added to the mix - and they won’t be used for tonight’s salad.

Meghan Markle faces another tense moment in her long-running family feud.

According to reports, Meghan’s half-sister Samantha Markle is making a last-ditch attempt to revive the libel case she filed back in 2022 over comments she made in her infamous interview with Oprah Winfrey with Prince Harry. 

Samantha previously lost the case in March 2024, but today’s hearing in Jacksonville, Florida, (September 9) could decide whether the Duchess of Sussex must go to trial.

If Samantha succeeds, Meghan could face a courtroom showdown and possible damages.

But if the case is dismissed again, there will be no higher court to turn to, marking the end of Samantha’s three-year fight.

Meghan is not expected to appear in court, but Samantha’s lawyer, Peter Ticktin, had harsh words for the Duchess.

According to the *Daily* *Express*, he said: “If I were to give advice to Meghan, it would be to wake up and smell the coffee. She keeps trying, but she’s not coming across the way she wants to to the American public.”

Meghan’s attorney, Michael J. Kump, previously dismissed the lawsuit, saying they would give it “the minimum attention necessary, which is all it deserves.” 

Her legal team has argued that any perceived link between Samantha and online hate groups is an opinion protected by the First Amendment.

1ncqv73,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ncqv73/im_28m_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my_fiancée/,I'm (28M) thinking of breaking up with my fiancée (28F) of 4.5 years because I feel like she doesn’t give me enough attention?,"A little bit of context first. My fiancée and I met in college, but we didn’t start dating until after we graduated. We’ve taken trips together to the beach, concerts, etc.—normal couple stuff. We’ve been planning to move in together before getting married next summer, just to see if things work out as well living together as they do now. We’ve even started buying things for the apartment little by little—microwave, coffee maker, blender, etc.—to be ready for next year.

I should mention that I live in a very traditional country, where moving in together before marriage is frowned upon. My parents don’t have an issue with it, but some of my relatives (and even my MIL) are against it. My FIL passed away about 5 years ago, which is why I don’t mention him.

My fiancée is the middle child of 3 sisters. Her older sister is married and lives with her husband, while her younger sister just graduated dental school and is moving about 1.5 hours away to another state to do her specialty. My fiancée and her mom are the main financial support for her younger sister. I don’t mind this at all—I actually admire how much she helps her, and I would do the same if I were in her position.

For context: I work as a professor at the state university while studying for a graduate degree, and I also get a government scholarship for my studies. My fiancée works at a vineyard during the day and runs a small baking business from home in the afternoons.

The issue is that we’re both very busy people. On top of that, my MIL doesn’t really like me, and since my fiancée runs her baking business from home, there are weekdays where I can’t even visit because her mom doesn’t want me around. Usually, though, we spend quality time together on weekends.

But now that her younger sister is moving, my fiancée and her mom are planning to visit her every other weekend to help her with meals (to freeze) and chores, since her specialty will keep her busy between the university and the hospital. This means the little quality time my fiancée and I do get will basically be cut in half.

I asked her if, on the weeks when she visits her sister, we could maybe spend a day together during the week instead. Like, maybe she could take a break from baking orders one afternoon so we could have time together. Skipping the vineyard isn’t possible, and I also have university responsibilities in the mornings. But she told me it wasn’t possible because now more than ever she needs the money to support her sister—tuition is expensive and those biweekly trips also cost money.

This makes me feel bad, because I always try to make time for her and rearrange my activities, putting everything else second when it comes to her. But I don’t feel like she does the same for me. It makes me feel like I’m begging for whatever leftover time she has. I hate feeling like that, like I’m just a second option.

Whenever I bring up that I feel she doesn’t give me enough attention or that I’m not high enough on her priority list, I’m the one who ends up apologizing. She always says “you have to understand that the #1 priority is me and what I want to do, and you need to accept that I can’t give you more time than I already do because I’m too busy with other things.”

I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I understand that supporting her sister is important and that money matters, but where does that leave me? I’ve seriously considered breaking off the engagement because I don’t feel valued enough. I feel like I would drop everything for her, but she drops me for everything else. Talking to her about this again isn’t an option—we’ve had this conversation many times, and it always ends the same way: nothing is going to change.

My only hope has been that once we live together, things will get better and we’ll spend more time together. But I feel like hanging on to that hope is just lying to myself.

I love her, but I don’t know how to handle this situation. I really need an outside perspective on whether my feelings are justified, or if I’m just being insensitive to her situation. If anyone needs more details to understand better, I can answer in the comments. I’m honestly desperate to figure this out.

TL;DR: Been with my fiancée (28F) for 4.5 years, we’re engaged and planning to move in together next year. She’s very busy with work and supporting her younger sister financially, and now she’ll be spending every other weekend helping her sister who moved away. I already feel like I don’t get enough attention and that I’m low on her priority list. I’ve tried talking to her but nothing changes. Not sure if I should end the engagement because I feel undervalued, or if I’m just being insensitive to her situation.",1,1757442524.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

Non-smoker, social drinker
Currently on Wellbutrin (450 mg) for depression, Adderall (20 mg) for adhd and continuous birth control where I skip the placebo pills and do not have a period.

Last Monday and Tuesday I noticed my acid reflux was a little worse than usual and took some nexium and avoided carbonation and coffee for a couple days, this went away. I had a normal appetite during this time and the rest of the week until Friday. Friday I forced myself to eat a few pieces of tofu and some rice (about half a cup) for dinner because I wasn’t super hungry and figured it was because I had taken an Adderall that day. Saturday I was not hungry at all, ate about 10 French fries then nothing. Sunday I could only eat half a croissant in the morning. This week I have had to force myself to eat as much as I can because I have absolutely 0 appetite and feel too full after a couple bites of something. Yesterday I had half of an egg bite. 

This is weird to me because I have been hungry my whole life, I always wake up starving and am usually a pretty big snacker most days even if I take my meds, especially as they start to wear off. I have been on Wellbutrin regularly for 3 years and Adderall for 10 years, I take the Adderall on days I know I’ll need it for work in the mornings but usually skip a couple of weekdays and usually never take it on the weekends. I don’t think this is medication related because it has come on so suddenly and I have never experienced any symptoms like this before. I haven’t taken any Adderall this week and am just maintaining my Wellbutrin every morning as I have been for years. I have been on birth control for about 13-14 years, this specific brand for about 2 years now so I do not think it’s that either?

I also have no other symptoms aside from the acid reflux last week which has since gone away. I just have no appetite, I don’t feel stuffed or bloated, just not hungry and definitely full after I do try to eat anything, but not uncomfortable. I have no pain, I am still having completely regular, solid BMs (???) and drinking about 60-80 oz of water a day like I pretty much always have. I can’t finish any drink besides water because the taste just starts to make me not want it. I’ve never had sensory issues or sensitivities to food, no food allergies I’m aware of, I’ve been a vegetarian for 15 years but only due to not preferring meat or fish taste-wise, it was never a texture or psychological thing.

I have a doctors appt coming up next Tuesday anyway but figured I would ask here as I can’t seem to find anything (with no accompanying symptoms) online.

TLDR: Used to eat breakfast, dinner and snack everyday, now can’t finish half a snack, no other symptoms, no recent weight loss or lifestyle changes",1,1757442425.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Second, even though it has a cash-out minimum of $2, we can get there relatively quickly even though we mostly get little additions after every playing session. Because of this the funds seem to stack up way more.

For a while we've been using JustPlay alongside MoneyTime (we've been using JustPlay for longer), but we've concluded that we'd probably need a separate device so that we can have *all* of Gimica's games installed for its daily/treasure challenges (so that we don't have to keep reinstalling the games we don't play regularly). That and it doesn't have dark mode, so we can't stay very long on its screen anyway. It's for those reasons that we eventually had to leave JustPlay alone for now. MoneyTime's HideSeek games are honestly more enjoyable for us overall, and even the ad breaks don't bother us because the ""coffee break"" aesthetic is pretty cozy.

We were able to purchase Sonic Mania Plus a few days ago much in thanks to the money we earned on this app (the DLC was on sale, but it was still $2 and some change, and we wouldn't even have had *1* dollar if it weren't for MoneyTime's rate of exchange).

Racing thoughts won't let me sleep!,"For the past 3 months I (26 F) have had trouble staying asleep and it is now impacting my day. I wake up with racing thoughts, song lyrics/choruses, and just random noise in my head. I have done literally EVERYTHING I can to alleviate this. Learned over time that I need a minimum of 8-hour sleep but lately I have been getting maybe 4-5 hours, and wake up with an incredibly noisy head, groggy and exhausted, with trouble focusing on work due to sleepiness.

Here are the things that I have already been doing before this problem started:

\- No coffee, no weed, no alcohol

\- Turn off lights and in bed by 10 am + Have blackout curtains, live in a quiet neighborhood

\- No late-night weekends so as to not disturb sleep cycle

\- No changes in meds (I've been on thyroid meds for the past couple years)

\- No significant stress (by comparison I was SIGNIFICANTLY more stressed last year but never had this problem happen then)

\- Drinking minimal water before bed so I don't have to wake up to pee but sometimes this is unavoidable

\- Moderate lunches and dinners, will sometimes go without dinner. This has been normal for me for the past couple years.

I really don't know what to do. I don't have sleep apnea and really don't feel like going to a sleep medicine doctor just for them to put me on a CPAP machine. I just need my head to shut up.  Any advice will be appreciated!

Edit: I usually used to sleep well and heavy before this but it disrupted over the summer when my father visited who is a LOUD snorer (and refuses to do a sleep study). It has been a couple months since he left and I haven't been able to sleep well, and have noticed a loud mind to be the reason.

The Jacket Paraglider

A short story based on a dream ( by chatgpt)


Tyler stood at the edge of the cliff with nothing but a jacket, two lengths of rope, and a stupid amount of confidence.

Below him: nothing but wind and a stretch of rocks that looked like broken teeth.

Behind him: his girlfriend, silent, trusting.

And somewhere — not quite in the dream but watching it — I was there, narrating, shaping it, until my father’s friend barged into the daydream like an opinionated wrecking ball.

“Ridiculous,” he snorted, arms folded. “You think someone could survive a jump like that? With a jacket and rope? What you’re talking about isn’t paragliding. You’re thinking of hang gliding.”

He didn’t even know what paragliding was.

I snapped. “It’s a sport,” I yelled. “A respected sport. People train for this. People dedicate their lives to this!”

But the dream had dissolved around me — cliff gone, jacket gone, even Tyler and his girlfriend gone — replaced by this know-it-all shaking his head like my imagination was something that needed correcting.

Then came Tyler’s brother. Not that he looked like him — no, this dream-brother was more concept than person. The kind of guy who knew how to tie knots, adjust wing tension, and frown in a way that made you question your choices.

He had a boat. I wanted on the boat.

“I don’t think it’s safe,” he said, glancing at the weather. Stormclouds gathered like gossip overhead. “Wind’s unpredictable.”

So he grounded us. No lake. No test run. No jacket-jump trial.

I wanted to argue, but he was the expert. And besides, we were suddenly airborne.

We were paragliding — not peacefully, not like some poetic drifting above treetops — but in an obstacle course of madness. The sport, apparently, had evolved. Now the goal was to glide over towering trees and cling to their trunks like a caffeinated lemur, holding your body there, suspended in midair, until… what? A whistle blew? The timer ran out?

I launched from one tree to the next, legs wrapped around bark, arms straining. All around me, others did the same. We were athletes of some absurd forest aerial league. The score was survival. The rules? Arbitrary.

Once everyone had hugged enough trees, we descended — not with grace, but with gasoline.

Tyler’s brother handed me a helmet and gestured to a four-wheeler. No seatbelt. No warning.

I climbed on anyway.

We tore across jagged terrain, the wheels bouncing off miniature cliffs like rubber grenades. I wasn’t strapped in. I wasn’t ready. Every bump lifted me an inch off the seat, every sharp turn whispered, you shouldn’t have trusted him.

I screamed, “No!”

No, because “Stop” was too long.

He didn’t hear me.

I screamed it again.

This time, he looked in the rearview mirror. Slowed just enough to show me his face. Concern — fleeting, almost practiced. Then the engine roared and we launched over a ridge so high the air felt thin.

That’s when everything went silent.


I might’ve died.

But before the fall finished, before I could confirm if bones break in dreams, I heard my father calling my name. From the waking world. Pulling me up.


Epilogue

Somewhere, Mark was on a boat in the middle of an ocean, sipping coffee with six tornadoes spiraling around him like curious wolves.

He didn’t seem worried.

Some people don’t, even when they should.

1ncqqck,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ncqqck/aita_for_contemplating_breaking_up_with_my_bf_for/,AITA for contemplating breaking up with my bf for close to 9 years?,"Hi everyone, I've posted a few times before on this subreddit. I appreciate this community for giving great advice and feedback on situations that are posted here, including you, Charlotte! Hope you and Mike have a great wedding this month! Also, this will be a long read with lots of context. 

So I've (26F) been with my bf (27M) for close to 9 years now. We met in college, I was a second-semester freshman, and he was a junior (I got held back a year since I couldn't speak English as a kid). I didn't have any long-term relationships before that, except for a 2-week-long relationship with a guy I didn't really feel romantically towards, but he wanted to date me. When I met my bf, however, I caught feelings immediately. After two weeks of being in class together, he decided to ask me out for coffee, which ended up becoming dinner since I didn't realize his intention was to date me. I was very dense when it came to guys asking me out or being romantic towards me. 

I really liked him; he was kind, thoughtful, and sweet. He seemed to listen to what I had to say since I was a transfer student, and I had never been away from where I lived before (the university was 4 hrs away from where I lived). I was not adjusting really well and found that I liked his company. We went on dates and everything seemed fine. 

But after he had moved off campus and started working a job to support himself (his parents didn't have the money anymore to pay for his tuition), he became more and more irritated with me. I wasn't a party person since my family only drinks when there's food to pair it with (half of my family is Romanian, and my other half is Puerto Rican). I also didn't like meeting a lot of new people at once in a loud space late at night. My bf, however, would force me to stay out late at these parties despite that I didn't enjoy myself at all. 

There were times that he would say ""You don't have many friends since you don't go out a lot."" I was on the pre-med track, so I spent a lot of time studying. Plus my parents would constantly track what I was doing and ask about my grades, typical helicopter parents. He didn't understand that since his parents were very laid back and wanted him to go to medical school. My parents found out about my bf when my mom convinced me to spill the beans, but that was a mistake. I was constantly harassed from both sides on what I should be doing during my free time (parents=studying, bf = partying), and at times it was exhausting. Then came the pandemic. 

My parents forcibly removed me from where I was studying since my dad said, ""You are coming home today, I want no arguments. I pay for your tuition, so I own you,"" at 6 am in the morning while my bf was lying next to me. He looked shocked since he had never heard my parents speak to me like that. My bf, not knowing any better, told me that I should tell my parents that they wouldn't come until later that week by bus. But to both of our surprise, my dad decided to come up the very next morning and forcibly remove me. 

My bf was angry since he wanted to take care of me and have us live together at his place. But whenever I would get sick, he would say, ""It's just a cold. How do you survive when you don't have anyone to take care of you?"" (That has been a theme in our relationship.) My grades started to suffer when I stayed at my family's house, since they would get in the way of my classes. My classes would be around our dinner time, and I would get interrupted since my family would call me to the table during class time. 

When I couldn't do well on my MCAT, they blamed it on me not studying enough or spending too much time with my bf. However, during this time, my bf started acting really mean towards me during phone and video chat conversations. He said that he would dream about having sex with other girls from his high school. He even wanted a break from me. He complained about how his jobs at a supermarket and as a scribe were draining and that he should've applied to medical school sooner. He didn't apply to med school to take time for himself and to be with me. Even though we hadn't seen each other in months and at times begged me to see him, he started not wanting to see me once the lockdown began lifting. 

On one Christmas Eve, he came over and acted cold. The reason he said was, ""I don't think I love you anymore."" I cried in the bathroom, and I remembered he didn't move or seem concerned. We talked it out and he admitted that things were rough for him mentally since he felt miserable at his jobs. During my senior year, I went every other week to see him, even though my classes were remote, to be with him. I did his laundry, and I made him food sometimes. But basically, I did chores to make up for the fact that I wasn't living there, paying rent like his other roommates. 

Then, after undergrad, I went to grad school to improve my chances of getting into med school (my bf had already started his 1st year of med school), and we got into fights a lot. I felt that I was slowly losing myself since I would say sorry for things that weren't my fault and bending over backwards to make sure he was happy. It was the scariest feeling I ever felt, being forced to be small and being attacked by my family as well, for other things that were happening. 

After a while, with the help of therapy, I decided to break up with him. He did give me consolation by reading out a letter he had written saying what he did wrong during the relationship, how he didn't realize how he was projecting all of his insecurities of not being a social person and being miserable onto me, how he had treated me badly because that is how he had felt about himself, and that I deserved better. He didn't try to argue about getting back together, despite he was trying the night before and wished me well. It was very heartbreaking, but I felt free at the time. The only time we kept in contact was to get my stuff back. 

Yet, because of events that happened in grad school (a whole other story that is way too much for this one) I started to think about my time with him. I sensed that there was a change in him. When he finally came over to drop off my things, 2 months later, we went out to dinner. He repeated again that what he did to me all those years was terrible and that he regretted what he did. He told me that he understood why we broke up and that he missed me and hoped I was doing well. That is when I proposed to him that we would take 2 months to think about how we felt about each other and whether we wanted to get back together. He agreed. 

2 months went by, and we got back together on the condition that he wouldn't do the things that he used to do before we broke up. He agreed. He no longer projected his insecurities onto me (he was seeing a therapist at the time). He respected that when I was sick, he had to help me out (since on one of our vacations, I got sick and he made me continue with our plans, and I went back home with a 102-degree fever). 

However, since we got back together and have moved in together, some things trigger me. What my boyfriend used to do is take other people's sides, which he still does do on occasion, as he doesn't believe things without seeing them for himself. So if I were to say my dad or mom said something he would say ""I wasn't there so I don't know what you want me to say"" or ""You always raise your voice/act a certain way to make them do that so you shouldn't be doing that"" or ""If you hate them so much why do you still ask for their help?"" (I didn't end up going to medical school because I realized it was my parents who wanted me to go to medical school, so right now I am trying to find a job to pay off my loans). He has seen more of what kind of people they are, so he doesn't do this as often, but there are still times when he will do these things that make me feel unheard. 

Another thing is that I have brought up marriage before during our relationship. Recently, he had said that once he finishes medical school, he would propose to me. However, he is now halfway through his residency year and still hasn't proposed, but when I bring it up, he keeps saying he will do it soon. I've never really thought about marriage until I met him in college. He was the first guy that I ever liked and dated seriously. 

But because we have moved in together, have cats, and have a lot of things that connect us, would I be the AH if I didn't want to marry him? He has tried to help me find a job since the job market has been so bad. He has been encouraging me to go for a career that aligns with my future goals and even goes out of his way to find opportunities for me that he thinks I have a chance at. He does help me out with a lot of things, whether it is housework, a couple of times he did my remote job for me since I wanted some time away from it, and he offered to help me out, he will insist on being with me and taking me to places that he knew I would like (when I wasn't feeling sick). He encourages me when I set my mind to something like finishing my novel, which I have been editing for 14ish years. He encourages me to take up karate again since he knows that I miss doing it, even though I feel like I am out of shape. He always said that he admired that I had a black belt in karate. He makes me meals when I can't and tries to support me despite his busy schedule. He is a very hard-working man, and he is thoughtful for the most part. He still goes to therapy to try to better himself every day. 

Currently, I can't financially support myself, so he and I split the bills. He moved me into this apartment since my parents were driving me insane with the demands of maintaining one of the apartments they own (I moved in after I graduated and stayed for 2 years), so I don't have a place to move back to since I don't want to be in that situation again. With my lack of options, I can't get my own place even if I wanted to or get a job that I feel rewarded in to support myself without my bf's or family's help. 

Plus, the topic of marriage hasn't escaped his lips for all the years that we've been back together. But he always is thinking about a future with me by saying this like ""In our house we will have a library with a secret reading space"" or ""We will have a garden at our house since you like gardening"". I'm not sure how to feel. Or what to do since I feel trapped by expectations and limited options. Should I forget about marriage? Or should I demand that he propose now, even though I want him to do it without me having to tell him?",3,1757442221.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Polo Red is one of those scents that feels like it should remind you of something… but maybe not. I like wearing it on rainy, dreary days. It seems to team well with raindrops and gentle thunder, adding warmth to the melancholy of the day.

Fragrantica calls it woody spicy. Sure. To me it’s mostly powdery amber with cranberry, a squeeze of citrus, and a coffee bean tossed in for warmth. Relax—you won’t smell like you spilled your morning Starbucks all over yourself. 

Longevity is good; a late-afternoon spritz will bring it back to life, if needed.Out of all the Polo lineup, this and Red Rush are the only two I would purchase, though I haven’t tried the Red Parfum version yet. The rest are just boring scents in different-colored bottles. Sad, really, considering the famous designer name on the label. Still, it’s different enough that you won’t smell like every other cologne zombie out there.

**THE BREAKDOWN**

* **Rating**: 7/10 — because you’re smart and brought your umbrella today
* **Profile**: They say it's woody spicy but there is little spice.
* **Longevity**: Good, it will get you through the important time of the day.

1ncqleg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/1ncqleg/the_church_at_the_end_of_the_road_i_pastor_this/,The Church at the End of the Road - I Pastor This Little Ozarks Gem of a Church,"Nestled in the quiet hills of Stone County, Missouri, twelve miles down a winding dead-end road called Y hwy., sits Cedar Ridge Baptist Church. It’s a Southern Baptist Convention church with a congregation almost as small as the road is long, but don’t let the size fool you. What we may lack in numbers, we more than make up for in heart.

When I first stepped into Cedar Ridge Baptist Church less than a year ago, I knew I wasn’t just walking into a building. I was stepping into a story—one of faith, perseverance, and deep-rooted love for God and one another. The drive out here alone feels like a retreat, the kind of road where cell signal fades, and the world’s noise falls away.

One of my favorite moments every Sunday morning is the quiet walk from my car to the church door. There isn’t a house in sight, just the trees, the rolling hills, and the stillness of Table Rock Lake nearby. It’s a sacred moment—a pause before the day begins, where the world feels hushed and expectant.

I spend those early hours, going over my sermon and praying, letting the quiet calm my heart and sharpen my focus. There’s a sense of anticipation, knowing that soon, the stillness will give way to the warmth of fellowship. My favorite moment comes when I hear that first greeting—”Hello, Pastor”—as the first person arrives. That simple greeting, filled with kindness and familiarity, sets the tone for the rest of the morning. It reminds me that while the solitude is precious, it’s the people who make this church what it is.

Every Sunday, the morning air seems to hum with anticipation. Our building is modest, but the warmth of the people inside overshadows any physical structure. As a new pastor, I’m learning to know every face, every name, every story. And when someone new walks through those doors, they aren’t just noticed—they’re embraced, welcomed into a family they didn’t even know they had.

Our sanctuary may not be large, but it carries the weight of a couple generations of worship. You’re immediately enveloped by a sense of history and familiarity. The pews, smooth and worn from years of prayer, have a certain timelessness to them. They smell faintly of furniture polish, a scent that’s both comforting and grounding to me. It’s a fragrance I’ve come to know well, since my wife and I also serve as the church custodians. Each week, as we take care of the space, I’m reminded that these pews aren’t just for sitting—they’re places where lives have been touched, prayers whispered, and decisions made.

The simplicity of the sanctuary, with its modest pulpit, communion table, and plentiful windows, speaks volumes about the heart of this church. There are no fancy productions here, just the faithful dedication of a community that honors the core elements of worship: the Word, the sacrament, and prayer. In this space, the focus isn’t on the extravagance of things, but on the quiet, profound simplicity of faith.

We don’t have fancy lights or a sound system that could rival a concert hall. Instead, we have something better: a place where the simplicity of worship takes center stage. Here, it’s not about being polished—it’s about being present, about focusing on God’s Word, His promises, and His grace.

Life at Cedar Ridge is more than what happens on Sunday mornings. This is a church where care takes on a tangible form. When someone falls ill, meals appear at their door, rides to appointments are quietly arranged, and prayers are lifted up without ceasing.

When a family welcomes a baby, the whole church celebrates like it’s their own child. And when sorrow comes, as it inevitably does in this life, no one grieves alone. Whether it’s a potluck in the fellowship hall or a baptism in the lake down in the holler, everything we do reflects the heart of a family bound together by faith.

Worship here isn’t flashy, and it isn’t meant to be. It’s heartfelt and grounded. Our music might come from a piano or a guitar, sometimes both, but it always comes from the soul. Hymnals are passed down the rows, and voices join together, untrained but earnest.

When I step into the pulpit, I’m not speaking to a sea of anonymous faces. I’m preaching to people I know—people I’ve prayed with, laughed with, and cried with. My sermons are shaped by their lives, their struggles, and their joys, because we’re walking this road of faith together.

I am learning the true beauty of a small church like ours is in the quiet moments. It’s in the way we linger after service to talk about the week. It’s in the spontaneous prayers offered over coffee at the men’s breakfast or the way children sit beside their grandparents, absorbing the rhythms of worship from an early age.

It’s not about programs or production value—it’s about people. It’s about a community that reflects God’s love in real and personal ways.

Being the pastor of Cedar Ridge Baptist Church isn’t about necessarily about building something bigger. It’s about digging deeper. It’s about truly knowing the people you serve and allowing them to know you. It’s about rejoicing together in the good times and standing together in the hard ones.

This is ministry in its purest form. It’s not about chasing numbers or trends; it’s about faithfully shepherding the flock God has entrusted to you, one soul at a time.

If you ever find yourself longing for a place where the world feels smaller and faith feels bigger, I invite you to visit us at Cedar Ridge Baptist Church. Here, on this little hillside in Stone County, you’ll find a family ready to welcome you with open arms.

Because sometimes, the smallest churches reveal the grandest expressions of God’s love.",3,1757441919.0,ozarks,1,1.0,False

Anyways, here is what it said:   
  
Oh wow… the **Sinn EZM 1.1**. The watch that screams I’m tactical louder than a guy wearing 5.11 cargo pants to brunch.

This thing looks less like a watch and more like the dashboard clock from a Bundeswehr Panzer, ripped out and strapped to your wrist.

**The dial**? Zero flair. It’s like the Germans asked: “How do we make this watch sexy?” and then immediately answered: “We don’t.” It’s so clinical it makes a hospital waiting room look cozy.    

The **red date** on your EZM 1.1 is the ultimate German design flex: t’s barely visible in daylight — which is probably the point. It’s like Sinn said, “Jawohl, we give you a date… but if you want to read it, you must EARN it!”

That **left-hand crown** isn’t about ergonomics — it’s just there so people ask you why your watch looks upside down, and then you can flex your “it’s a mission timer, not a fashion accessory” speech.

That big red **“Ar”** at six o’clock? Only in Germany would you pay thousands for a watch so they can advertise that it’s filled with gas. It’s less luxury flex, more TÜV certification sticker.

The **case design**? It looks like the engineers spent five years calculating tolerances so it could survive a tank running it over… when in reality it’s just surviving your Monday meetings and maybe a spilled coffee.    

And the name: **Einsatzzeitmesser.** Of course. Germans don’t do “Submariner” or “Speedmaster.” They give you a 17-letter compound noun that sounds like it came straight out of a Bundesamt filing cabinet.

**Basically, your EZM 1.1 is the horological equivalent of a Leberkäse sandwich: functional, no-nonsense, and designed by people who think fun is a design flaw.**",42,1757441843.0,sinn,5,0.99,False
