1m3copj,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1m3copj/need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_my_parents/,Need advice on how to proceed with my parents. Feeling guilty.,"I (40f) really need advice with how to proceed with my family (parents mid-60s). This has been going on for years and I’m reaching a breaking point. 

My husband and I got engaged in December 2022. My parents were so happy for us, and cried tears of joy as I had gone through a divorce years prior and they were happy to see me happy again and in a healthy relationship. They also loved my boyfriend. 

Over the next couple weeks, my fiancé and I decided to have a destination wedding as we had both done the church and big wedding thing in both of our previous marriages, and wanted something more simple and fun. We decided Mexico would be the place and picked a date for January 2024 (13 months away). We made this announcement to our families. My husband (fiancé at the time) has children in their early 20s, whom were very excited about this. My parents…not so much. Their first excuse, in what would be a series of excuses, was they weren’t sure if they could get time off work. My mom is a hairstylist and owns her own salon, and my dad had been with his company for 25 years at that point. Not to mention, this was over a year’s notice. I was kind of taken a back by it. I briefly considered it may be an issue with finances, but they had recently paid off their house and had mentioned then, that it was nice to have the extra money each month. 

A few weeks go by and my fiancé and I are at my parent’s house visiting and we bring up the wedding. My mom gets all serious and says she’s not sure she’ll be able to go, she has developed a debilitating fear of flying. I’m shocked by this, as she had recently gotten back from a trip to AZ with her sisters in which she had to fly. Never once mentioned it when I had asked her how her trip was. This is feeling like another excuse, but I try to be sympathetic and suggest talking to her doctor about this, maybe he can prescribe medication or we can look into meditation. I offered to help figure something out as we have lots of time. Then, later that evening, my dad suggests getting married in Hawaii. I looked at him with utter shock, informing him mom would still have to fly there. I’m getting a sense that Mexico is the issue. This is confirmed as the weeks go on and they explain to me that they don’t feel safe going to Mexico. My parents don’t do a lot of traveling outside of their little bubble. So, to me, this is a valid concern, especially with how Mexico can be made to look in the media. So, we have them over and go over where we are going, a nice resort town and gated resort. Explained safety of this area vs traveling to other areas in the US that can be just as bad, but aren’t perceived this way as it’s in the US. I need to point out now, that my parents are very conservative Christian (Christian Reformed) and MAGA. And not just MAGA, they are QAnon. I am none of those. So, explaining to them the safety of where we are going while they are getting conflicting info from Trump and the media is proving to be difficult. At one point in a separate conversation with my dad, me mentions they are “afraid of the people”. 

We are now a few months from the wedding. It’s fall 2023. My parents have actually agreed to go and booked their plane tickets and put down a deposit with the travel agent I had been using for all of this (travel agent confirmed this to me). But in all of this time, there has been no excitement on their part about the wedding. No questions asked about how wedding planning is going, what we are doing for this or that. But, I’m trying not to let it bother me. 

A few weeks later, I brought my mom along to my wedding dress fitting where she will be seeing me in my dress for the first time and the only comment out of her mouth was how I “better not put on any weight”. What was supposed to be a meaningful moment has been ruined. I’m quiet on the ride back to drop her off at home. 

At this point, I’ve had enough and I send a text to my parents explaining how I’m feeling and that it feels like they don’t want to go. They respond with “we see the world differently”, how it’s a dangerous place and “WWIII Russian Sleeper Cells are waiting” blah blah blah. I tell them they need to decide why to do, that I’m done begging them to go. A few weeks go by and it’s been radio silence. I text them asking if they made a decision. My dad’s text 6 weeks before we are supposed to leave: 

“I have to inform you that we will not be going to Mexico.  We do not need any reimbursement for anything. I will call travel agent tomorrow.”

I never responded. I was devastated. My fiancé texted them asking week later asking them not to contact me, that I was heartbroken. He told them we’d reach out sometime after the wedding. I blocked them, so I don’t know if they ever attempted to contact me. 

The wedding and trip was AMAZING. They missed out on something very beautiful and special. About 2 months after we get back, I unblocked them and ask if they want to come over and visit about things. My goal in this was to figure out the exact reason they didn’t want to go. I heard so many excuses and I was so lost. They told me it’s because they were so torn, they visited with their “therapist” aka pastor and he told them not to go. What?! Shocked again. I couldn’t even look at them during this visit. We sat around our dining table and I just looked at my husband or down at my coffee. I couldn’t bear looking in their eyes. I never got the sense that they regretted it. I feel like they regretted the outcome, but to me that’s different than regretting their actions. This visit made them feel like our relationship is good again and they started reaching out. Just mundane stuff, sending cute videos or telling me about so and so. I wouldn’t respond as I wasn’t ready. They’d notice the silence after a while and then ask what’s wrong. I’d explain I’m having a hard time moving on. They’d say nothing. This has been going on for months now. And in this time, we’ve had some extended daily issues that brought us all together. I feel like my presence during this gave them the feeling of “she’s back, we’re a family again” but it wasn’t like that for me, I was being supportive to the rest of my extended family. The cycle would then repeat. 

I finally texted them and asked them what did they think would happen when they decided not to go to the wedding. My mom says:

“I never dreamt in a million years that it would cause such a heartache for you. To be absolutely honest I don’t think I ever thought past the not going.”

I responded saying that was shocking that she didn’t think of the results of her actions. Radio silence. Haven’t heard anything from her since May 6. My dad has texted randomly about unrelated stuff. 

I don’t know how to move on. I am feeling incredibly guilty not having them in my life and missing out on little milestones or events in my and my new families lives. Not to mention what’s  going on in theirs. But I’m still so incredibly hurt by what they did. Clearly they just want to sweep things under the rug and pretend it didn’t happen and move on, but I can’t and I don’t want a surface level relationship with them. What do I do?!

TLDR: parents made excuse after excuse not to come to my wedding, not shocked that I’m having a hard time having a relationship with them. Feeling guilty about it and need advice. ",1,1752869570.0,family,1,1.0,False

With a pack made of socks and a halo well-worn.  
His robe was all wrinkled, his sandals were shot,  
And his holy beard tangled in knots he forgot.

He knocked on a door with a sign that said “NO,”  
So he scribbled *“Just checking!”* and gave it a go.  
The guard said, “Your paperwork’s centuries late.”  
He shrugged, “Well, I *did* rise again—give or take.”

At customs they asked him, “What’s your intent?”  
He said, “Mostly kindness, and maybe a tent.”  
They searched through his bag full of loaves and old fish,  
And muttered, “This fellow is oddly delish.”

He wandered through cities where rich people dined,  
And offered free hugs, which they all declined.  
He juggled some figs for a small caravan,  
And healed a man’s rash with a big frying pan.

He taught a stray goat how to moonwalk on cue,  
Turned mud into coffee and socks into stew.  
He crashed at a hostel (they charged him in prayers),  
And bartered his sandals for two folding chairs.

He shouted, “Rejoice!” at a laundromat crowd,  
Then tripped on a mop and proclaimed it out loud.  
He baptized a duck by mistake in a sink,  
Then gave it a name: “Little Savior, I think.”

He passed by a wall that was ten stories tall,  
He climbed it with grace and a pink rubber ball.  
When questioned by guards if he *had* a real visa,

College

My SIL and I met in college in 2012 and I was very friendly and made friends easily, while she did not. She once said, ""I didn't come to college to make friends."" But I befriended her anyway and we became close friends and eventually called eachother ""best friends"". I had other friends during this time and a couple of others I would have called ""best friend"", so she was never the only friend in the picture.

After college

After we graduated was when I started to notice some things I didn't like about her. She made snide comments all the time, was very negative, and always complained about something. It got to the point where I anticipated what she was going to complain about in every conversation. It was tiring but I kept on being her friend and planning coffee dates multiple times a month.

Side note: I am a Christian. I am a loving person and have delt with people's negative personalities for a long time and just kept hanging on to relationships that did not serve me in the name of ""loyalty"". My first friendship break-up was when I was 30 years old. I have grown up with a people-pleasing tendency. I have gone to counseling about this and am actively working on it. No more dealing with pleasing people and always being the nice one. I am done.

I kept being friends with her and just felt like this was probably part of normal friendship. We have a lot in common and have had good times but after all the negativity I felt myself pulling away and not planning as many things with her.

The Awkward Moment (2023-ish)

Fast forward several years. I got married to her brother (who is so different from her, he is an amazing person). I got pregnant a few months after my ""former best friend"" turned SIL went through a miscarriage. I visited her and brought her a meal and some cookies. I cried with her and spent 3 hours with her that day. I didn't bring up the miscarriage after that.

Then I noticed that she ignored me for 2 months. We went to a few get-togethers with friends and she did not say hi or even make eye contact with me at all. So I decided to confront her about it. When I did she said that ""I was not there for her"" when she went through her miscarriage. I felt really bad and apologized but that has always bothered me because I thought that spending 3 hours with her and bringing her a meal was ""being there for her"". Was I the only friend she was relying on her to ""be there for her""?...I never talked to her about this though.

Present-day

I have never felt comfortable around her since then. I don't feel like getting together. I dread family get togethers (which are mostly on major holidays, thankfully). I just get an icky feeling/vibe from her now. I think that she thinks everything is fine/normal between us. I think it is years of built up resentment/bitterness on my part. I wish I told her how I felt years ago, but now it probably won't solve anything. Even if I were to bring it up, she's not going to change and it might make things worse between us and awkward at familiy gatherings.

She doesn't have many close friends (she will even admit that) and I now understand why after all these years.

I am about to have baby #2 and she is pregnant with her first. I don't really feel excited for her, just indifferent. She is just a SIL to me, not a best friend but I feel obligated to involve her/invite her to things. I definitely don't initiate anything/text her unless I absolutely need to. I've definitely distanced, but what should I do from now on? Especially since out kids will most likely be growing up together in the same city.",1,1752868798.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False
1m3cd1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3cd1p/still_in_the_snow/,Still In The Snow,"A simple dream yes, of course, that’s how this starts. Amanda young about 10 prancing around a thrift store with her mother.

""Can I buy this?""
""Is this a good deal?""

Questions like that thrown around by Amanda, with a giggle as a response from her mother, who was looking at dresses and other clothing items.

""Yes, dear, of course. I think that dress would look cute on you.""

She leaned down and took the dress Amanda had been gushing about.

""Now dear, go look around. I’ll be here for a little while remember don’t break anything."" She reminded more gently than scolding.

Amanda smiled as the dress was taken from her. She walked off and went through a few coat racks, traversing them like a jungle before sitting in one where it was mostly dark, the store lights barely shining through the dense coats. She expected to see her mom’s shoes walk by, planning to jump out and mess with her, but it felt like too much time had passed.

The store got dark. No lights on anymore.

So she exited the coat rack. It looked like she was in a closed store.

""Mom?"" she called out, her voice sounding raw, like she had shouted it dozens of times already.

Then it started to feel cold. The glass of the storefront now looked frosty, with snow outside.

""No, no... Mom?"" she cried out until she thought she saw something outside the glass of the storefront.

Suddenly

Amanda woke immediately tense and tried to move. Failing to do so, she realized she was having another sleep paralysis episode a common occurrence in her daily life at this point, but that never made it easier. Then her demon paid her a visit, a shadow in the shape of a man leaning over her. The mouth or where it would be on the shadow moved, gurgling the words, each one followed by a drip of black sludge from the shadow's mouth right onto her face.

""Tick tock, tick tock, tick to-""

The shadow faded as her alarm started beeping loudly, making Amanda sit up in her bed quickly. She turned off her alarm, feeling a cold sweat soaking her clothes.

""Fuck, it's getting worse,"" she mumbled to herself, tears almost spilling from her eyes as she got up and walked to the bathroom, opening up a pill bottle and taking two. Apparently, they were supposed to help stop sleep paralysis in exchange for paranoia, anxiety, and occasionally hallucinations but it helped sometimes. She had recently gotten a refill, a simple change of brand, so the pills looked different than they usually did.

Just then, her phone rang. Seeing that it wqs from her dad she picked up quickly.

""Hey, Dad,"" she spoke, sounding a bit tired with a hint of fear the sleep paralysis episode still affecting her as she held the phone to her ear.

""Hi, Kiddo, you ready for the weekend trip to the cabin?""

Her father sounded excited he always seemed to look forward to these trips even after all that had happened at that old family cabin.

""Yeah, Dad, I'm looking forward to it. I finished packing my stuff last night, so I'll meet you there by noon.""

She walked back into her bedroom, holding her phone to her ear with her shoulder as she picked out her clothes for the day.

""Alright, honey, just be safe. The roads can get bad with the snow,"" her father said, sounding concerned.

""I know Dad, don't worry. Bye.""

She hung up and got dressed, understanding his concern but shrugging it off knoeing he was slightly overprotective ever since that night.

See, her mother had gotten lost years ago during a hike on the mountain the same one the cabin is on. Amanda was young at the time 12 years old, to be exact. Her mother had gone on a hike while Amanda's dad watched her. She never came back. A blizzard started just hours after she left. Amanda's father couldn't do anything he didn't want to leave her a child alone in the cabin dueing a blizzard but also wanted to find his wife so he radioed the ranger after the blizzard, hoping she would be found. They never did tind her. The snow had covered any tracks and blocked many cave entrances it was already a long shot at finding her but that brought the chances down almost to 0.

Amanda could never forget that night. That's where she got her sleep paralysis demon watching out the windows of that cabin, distant shadowy figures in the snow from her imagination, and the ticking of the clock as the seconds passed.

Amanda had an aching feeling the reason her father loved going back there was because a small part of him still thought he would find her mother.

Amanda shut her eyes tight for a moment, bringing herself back to the present, dressed in the outfit she had picked out.

""I really need to schedule an appointment with my therapist again. This shit is starting to get to me,"" she spoke aloud to herself, an attempt to not forget again.

Amanda left the house shortly after, loaded up her car, and started her drive up the mountain.  
The drive was mostly normal, except Amanda felt the need to keep checking behind her in the backseat the constant feeling of someone watching her, or some presence in the backseat at least.

""It's just the pills' side effects,"" she reminded herself as she turned on the radio. Her therapist had suggested distractions and reminding herself it was just the pills.

Otherwise, the ride was fine. She arrived at the cabin quite quickly, parking her car next to her dad's red sedan.

Amanda exited her car, looking at the dusting of snow on the ground before heading inside, seeing her dad making coffee on the wood burner.

""I don't know how you drink that shit, it's so bitter,"" Amanda said.

Her father smiled as he heard her voice, looking over at Amanda.

""Well, unlike you, I don't get that sugary Starbucks shit every day black coffee works for me.""

Amanda chuckled, setting down her bag on the table. She was always able to be more open with her father curse in front of him, even insult him and never got in trouble for it especially after her mother passed.

""Well, it tastes good, and I have the money for it. It's good to see you, Dad. I look forward to the weekend.""

Amanda's dad smiled and walked over to Amanda with his small tin mug of coffee.

""I'm glad you're looking forward to it. Could you bring in some more wood? It's supposed to get cold tonight and snow some more, so the more logs you can bring in, the better.""

Amanda nodded and spoke.  
""Yeah, sure, Dad. You're better with the wood burner than me anyway.""

She walked outside to the wood stack on the side of the cabin. Amanda began picking up the wood, stacking it against her chest and arm to carry more inside.

Suddenly, Amanda saw something out of the corner of her eye.  
She dropped the wood and turned to look at the shadowy figure she thought she saw, but it was gone.

""Just the pills,"" she repeated to herself, reminding herself it wasn't real, as she picked up the wood she dropped and carried it inside.

Amanda's dad looked at her as the door opened.  
""Are you alright? I thought I heard a bit of a ruckus out there.""

Amanda shut the door and set the logs next to the wood burner.  
""Yeah, I'm fine. Just dropped some of the wood,"" she said, not wanting to explain further and concern him.

""Alright, be more careful next time. Could break a toe if you drop it on your foot.""

She nodded at her father's warning, turning on the radio before laying down on the couch. The radio began playing Christmas music after the familiar local DJ, Jackie Spells, wished everyone a nice holiday season.

""You know, Amanda, your mother was close friends with that DJ,"" her father recalled as he stoked the fire.

""Really? I didn't know she was friends with him.""

Her father shut the wood burner and the latch before continuing.  
""Yeah, they were friends in high school before me and your mother started dating. Jackie was real broken up about it when he heard she went missing mentioned it on the radio for like a month.""

This was news to Amanda. She hadn't even met Jackie when she was a kid, and her mom didn't seem like the type to be friends with a DJ, even a local one.

""Well, I guess she was more wild when she was younger than I thought.""

Her dad chuckled before he bundled up.  
""Well, I'm going to walk the trails make sure there are no issues while it's light out. Would you like to join me?""

He walked to the door but paused, looking at her.

""No, I'll go on one tomorrow wirh you, but I had a rough night.""

Her dad left without much else to say, leaving her alone in the cabin.  
The only sounds were the wood burner, Christmas music, and her breathing relaxing.

Amanda shifted off the couch, walking over to a cooler and removing a beer from it—one her father had brought.

""One beer can't hurt,"" she mumbled to herself, remembering that she wasn't supposed to drink on her medications but she never really had issues with it.

She cracked the can open, taking a sip, allowing the piss-like drink into her mouth. She never enjoyed the taste but didn't have many options at the moment since her dad loved it.

""Fuck, I always forget how bad this tastes.""  
She took another sip the taste not as bad this time before looking out the window, her eyes fixing on the horizon as the snow began to fall at a slightly increased pace.

Right before she took another sip, her eyes fixed on one of those fucking figures features obscured by darkness but even as she stared directly at it, the figure didn't disappear like they usually did.

Amanda's heart started beating faster. She dropped the beer, only a few sips in, allowing it to spill onto the wood floor.

""That has to be someone,"" Amanda told herself, even though there were no other cabins nearby, and the hiking trail her father took wasn't anywhere close to where she saw the figure.

Amanda grabbed her coat, bundling up her shoes were still on as she ran outside shouting.

""Hey, you're not allowed to be here! You're trespassing!""  
She shouted as the figure took off running at a very fast pace—seemed more like a deer or a damn track runner the way it moved.

Amanda followed. She wanted a good look at this thing.  
With each step, the snow got deeper more and more debris, sticks, and rocks made it harder to give chase.

Amanda tripped, letting out a scream, but before she hit the snowy ground, everything went black for a moment.

Amanda shot up on the couch with a scream, her heart racing as she let out hurried breaths, looking around.

""It was a fucking nightmare?!"" she shouted questioning, confused, and scared all at once standing up off the couch, holding her head as she saw her coat still hung up.

""I can't... ugh,"" she struggled with her words for a moment as she reached into her pocket, dialing her doctor's number.

One ring.  
Two rings.  
Then a voice.

""Good afternoon, Dr. West's office. This is Emily speaking. How may I help you today?""

The receptionist's voice came over the phone, a slight relief to Amanda as she took another breath to calm down and speak properly.

""Hello, Emily, it's Amanda. I need to speak to Dr. West immediately. I don't give a fuck if he's a bit busy I need to speak to him. So transfer me, or whatever you have to do. I have to speak to him.""

The receptionist heard the seriousness in Amanda's voice.

""Ma'am, please calm down. You're lucky he isn't busy I'll transfer you over.""

A few moments of silence passed before a masculine voice came over the phone.

""Hello, this is Dr. West speaking pleasant to hear from you Amanda.""

Amanda responded quickly.

""What the fuck were these meds you gave me, Doc? I'm seeing shit stuff that ain't there my dreams are feeling real, and let me tell you, a nightmare ain't fucking pleasant when it feels like you're really going through it.""

Amanda didn't really think out the words she was saying.

""Amanda, you ran out of refills two months ago. Where did you get those?""

Amanda quickly hung up her phone as memories flooded back into her head.  
How could she forget? Even in a panic she should have remembered she had ran out decided to buy illegally from the pharmacist who had a thing for her to ween herself off.

As she started pacing, trying to calm herself down, she stepped in a sticky puddle by the window. Looking down, she saw the slightly yellow liquid.

""Beer?""

Her heart almost stopped beating in her chest as she stood frozen, staring out the window. More of those things stood there, it was getting darker, and the snow was picking up even more.

""It's a bad batch. It has to be a bad batch. I must be tripping. That asshole must have realized I wasn't into him and gave me a higher dose something like that.""

She tried to calm herself down, reminding herself of her college bad weed trips but those things she was staring at—those things were real. There was no changing that in her mind. And they were slowly getting closer to the cabin.

She stepped out of the beer puddle and threw on her jacket again.  
Only this time, she took off running on the trail her dad had taken earlier.

""Dad! Dad, where the fuck are you!""  
She shouted, tears pouring down her face as she ran. She could feel those things following her. She only stopped when she saw more of them ahead, blocking the path.

""Fuck, fuck, I can't-oh God.""

Amanda panicked, turning and running into the woods, shedding her jacket when it got caught on a branch. The cold immediately hit her biting at her skin without much protection from the cold as she stumbled forward, noticing she didn't see the things chasing her anymore.

Shivering, she staggered through the trees until her blurry, frozen gaze caught sight of a cave entrance.

Without thinking, Amanda pushed through the brush and stumbled inside.  
Relief quickly turned to horror.

""M-Mom?""

The word slipped out, broken and small, as she spotted a frozen corpse. The skin was blue, one ear had fallen off at some point, but that hair those clothes that was her mother.

Amanda inched closer, reaching out with trembling fingers as if she could still check for a pulse.

A snap of a branch made her whip her head around.  
At the entrance of the cave, one of those things stood there, blocking her escape.

""No!""  
Amanda screamed, voice cracking in terror as she ran at the thing, trying to push past it but before she could, snow collapsed from above the cave mouth, sealing her inside.

She clawed at the packed snow until her fingers were red and numb, each movement getting slower, weaker, until finally she stopped.

Defeated and shivering, Amanda walked back to her mother's frozen body.  
She curled up beside it, her tears freezing on her cheeks as her eyes drifted shut.

""I'm so sorry, Mom... I'm so sorry...""  
The words faded into the cold, swallowed by the darkness that filled those caves walls perhaps even the same darkness that had been following her.

I’ve (18F) suffered from constipation since I was a kid and would often have accidents because I would be in bed for days unable to walk until it passed. Nobody noticed because I would just say “my stomach hurts” and I didn’t have very present parents. Recently, I finally went in to a GI for other issues and was recommended stimulant laxatives, but she passed my stomach issues onto gynecology as she suspects endometriosis. 

I bought a pack of 30 bisocodyl tablets last month and used them until they were gone, starting at 1 tab a day and then up to 3 towards the end. They hurt like shit but they worked- until they didn’t. I ended up just sitting on the toilet waiting, and leaking watery yellow out into my pants. That was June 9. I have since been awaiting a BM, and thanks to milk of magnesia I passed a small bit of hard stool painfully on the 15th. Did not help much. 

Yesterday, I was having sharp pains in my stomach throughout the day and was extremely bloated. My thighs and lower stomach area were physically warm as if I spilled hot tea on them. I was considering going to the ER. Today, I almost feel fine, other than cramping and a loud, bubbly, stomach and weird feeling in my upper abdomen after I eat anything. 

I just chugged some coffee and ate a few apples to try and get something. Does anyone have any advice? Does it seem like I need to go in?",1,1752868788.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1m3cc4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m3cc4l/examine_if_oxo_brew_12cup_coffee_maker_truly/,Examine if OXO Brew 12-Cup Coffee Maker truly elevates drip coffee experience review!,"**Elegant Design That Stands Out**  
The sleek, silver finish of the OXO 8721200 Brew Coffee Maker immediately grabbed my attention when I unboxed it. It sports a stainless steel exterior that not only complements any modern kitchen but also feels durable and robust. Measuring 12.25""D x 8""W x 14.5""H, it fits snugly under most cabinets—perfect for a space-conscious setup. The buttons and interactive display screen are intuitive, though they don’t feel overly complicated, which is ideal for someone like me who relies on their coffee maker before caffeine kicks in. The compact design, coupled with the cleverly placed components like the small drip tray and carafe, ensures it doesn’t dominate counter space.  

**Outstanding Features: What Sets It Apart**  
What immediately stood out during daily use was the podless single-serve option. In the mornings, I often brew just one mug, and this feature eliminates wasteful pods while delivering fresh-tasting coffee directly into my favorite cup. It also has two convenient brew basket sizes—small for 2-4 cups and large for 5-12 cups—which came in handy when I hosted brunch over the weekend. Another noteworthy aspect is the double-wall thermal carafe; it kept my coffee hot for hours without altering its flavor. The programmable nature of this coffee maker added a layer of flexibility to my mornings, allowing me to set it up the night before and wake up to an enticing aroma.  

[Check OXO 8721200 Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ccsvqzqs/)  

**Positives**  
- Sleek design that fits most kitchen layouts.  
- Dual serving options: single-serve and batch brewing.  
- Preheats water to 194-205°F, the SCA-preferred temperature.  
- Double-wall thermal carafe maintains heat for hours.  

**Performance and the Daily Brewing Experience**  
The first sip said it all—this coffee maker nails it when it comes to taste. The BetterBrew Precision technology ensures that the temperature and brewing cycles are consistent, resulting in a smooth and flavorful cup every time. As someone who often switches between a strong morning brew and lighter coffee later in the day, I appreciated its ability to cater to both. However, I noticed it’s not the fastest machine on the market. While preheating water to the optimal range ensures better flavor, it takes slightly longer than some other coffee makers I’ve tested. Whether I was preparing a weekday cup or filling it to its 12-cup capacity for guests, its performance stayed consistent, and the streamlined brewing process was easy to master.  

**Challenges: A Few Things to Consider**  
Although I appreciate the robust design, there are certain aspects that could use improvement. The carafe lid occasionally feels a bit finicky—it’s not difficult to use, but it requires more alignment than I’d prefer when pouring. Cleaning the stainless steel components is simple for the most part, but the interior cleaning could be made easier if the descaling solution were included in the box rather than sold separately. Additionally, at nearly 15 pounds, it isn’t the most portable coffee maker, which might be a factor if you like to occasionally reorganize your kitchen.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Setup for pouring with the carafe can be slightly tricky.  
- Cleaning might require additional purchases like descaling solutions.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other drip coffee makers I've tested, like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Technivorm Moccamaster, this coffee maker strikes a balance between performance and usability. While the Breville has more extensive programming options, the OXO Brew Coffee Maker keeps things straightforward, which I think will appeal to users who prefer simplicity. The Technivorm excels in speed but lacks the single-serve functionality that has become a favorite feature of mine with the OXO Brew. What sets this product apart from competitors is its thermal carafe and the thoughtful podless single-serve design, which reduces waste without sacrificing the end result.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When weighing its price against its robust feature set, I find this coffee maker to offer great cost-efficiency. High-quality brewing is achieved thanks to its SCA Gold Cup standard compliance, and the thermal carafe justifies its position amongst premium-grade options. While it is slightly pricier than basic models, the added functionality of programmable settings and customizable serving options give it a notable edge. If you’re someone who enjoys high-quality coffee without the dependency on pods, it feels worth the spend.

Because that’s how I’ve felt for the past two days. I don’t know what to do, or how I can make it stop. I’ve never posted on something like this before, but at this point I’m willing to try anything, I’m desperate for some advice.

I’ll take you back to the start, or what I assume to be the start of it all. 

I live a fairly ordinary life. I’m a 21 year old guy, living on his own in a bit of a rundown flat, commuting to work on the train everyday. This doesn’t leave me a lot of spare time for anything else, really, because my commute is an hour each way. My days consist of waking up at 6:30, getting dressed, walking to the train station, catching the train, walking to work, working, and then doing the same process in reverse. That’s it. I don’t really have any friends to hang out with, and I’m not exactly on the best terms with my family (for reasons I won’t go into here), so I sit on my own each evening, watching TV or playing video games. I keep myself to myself, and get on with my life.

Now, you may be thinking that my life sounds pretty miserable or boring, but to me, it’s perfect. I’ve always been a bit of a loner, so my daily routine suits me perfectly, and I’ve been living happily like this for the past year. 

That is, until a dream I had 3 nights ago.

Like all dreams, it didn’t have a beginning. I was simply there, no recollection of opening my eyes in this new place, or how I’d got there. I was standing in the middle of a large grassy field. I could feel the wind blowing gently on my face, and I ran my hand through the large grass strands that stretched up from the ground to meet me. I looked around, and realized I was alone. The field was empty, save for a lone tree, a few hundred feet away from me. I started to make my way over to it, not knowing why I was doing so, but just having the feeling that there was something there I needed to see. As I got closer, I could make out the faint shape of letters carved into the wood. From where I was standing, I couldn’t quite make out what they were, and so I decided to get closer for a better look.

And that’s when I felt it for the first time. Even in my dream, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and a chill went down my spine. I could tell that I was no longer alone. Someone else was here, watching me. I span myself around, and caught the first glimpse of them. They were far away, so far away that all of their features were obscured by the distance. All I could make out was a featureless shadow, standing in the grass, watching me. I stood for what seemed like hours, just staring back at them, unsure of what to do. 

And then they started to run.

The figure lurched forwards with impossible speed, heading straight for me. Instinctively, I span back around and began to take off in the opposite direction, towards the tree. The words on the tree were becoming clearer, but I still couldn't make out what they were yet. As I ran through the grass, trying desperately not to trip on the uneven terrain, I glanced behind me to ascertain how much distance I had left between me and my pursuer.

Not much. 

It had impossible speed, coming at me like a steam train, closing the gap between us in a matter of seconds. It would only be a few more until it was on me. I began to panic and tried to pick up my pace, but as is the curse of most dreams, I was running at a snail's pace. My foot slipped, and I was sent crashing to the ground. I flipped over just in time to see my pursuer pouncing on top of me. I could see now that it was not the distance that had caused it to look featureless. It was featureless. Just a black hole of pure energy in the shape of a person. It brought its ‘hands’ up to my face, placing them on either side of my eyes. I began to cry and plead with it, begging it not to hurt me. It didn’t listen. Instead, it plunged it’s dark thumbs into my eye sockets, blocking my vision and causing me to scream out in pain.

And then I was awake, screaming still.

I scanned my room, looking for the creature, but I was alone.

“Fucking stupid nightmare.” I muttered to myself as I led back down, trying to slow my breathing and calm myself down. I managed to eventually get back to sleep, and awoke at 6:30 to my normal alarm buzzing next to me. I got up and began to get ready for work as normal, when my mind drifted back to my nightmare. I tried to think of the letters I had seen carved into the wood of the tree, but all I could remember were,

“Erom ecno niks ym no enihs”

There was still a lot more carved into it, but in my panic I couldn’t make out the rest. 

“Whatever,” I thought to myself.

I left my building and began my walk to the train station, the thoughts of my dream already beginning to fade from my memory, chalked up t o nothing more than a stupid dream caused by a scary video game or something. 

You’d be surprised by how quiet the streets are in a big town at 7am. No one trying to sell you things, no one bumping into you or pushing past, most of the time it’s just me and the road. Nice and quiet. It was the same on Thursday morning, but as I got closer to the train station, I began to get a familiar feeling. The hairs on the back of my neck began to stand up, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around slowly, hoping to just see another commuter making their way to work behind me.

The street was still clear, with no sign of anyone else having been there other than me. I breathed a sigh of relief and shook my head, thinking that the previous night’s dream was just playing tricks on my mind. However, as I began to turn my head back in the direction I was traveling, my eyes caught a glimpse of someone, standing behind a lamppost. Only half of their body was visible, the other half hidden behind the metal pole. They were standing about 200 meters from me, so I couldn’t easily make out any of their features. All I could see was an eye, glistening in the reflection of the streetlight. Whoever it was was watching me, motionless. I stood for a moment, debating what to do.

I brought my hands up to my face and momentarily covered my eyes as I rubbed them. When I removed my hands once more, the figure was gone.

I let out a faint laugh, cursing myself for being so stupid as to believe someone was watching me. It was most likely just someone making their way to work, just like me. They had momentarily stopped to look at me, the only other person on the street, just as I had done to them. And then they had moved on, got on with their day, just as I had to do now as well.

The rest of the day went by as usual, with nothing out of the ordinary to report, that is, until I was on the way home. I got on the train home as I normally would, and we set off back towards my home town. There are a number of stops between where the train begins and where it ends, with the carriages steadily becoming quieter and quieter as the journey progresses. By the time it reaches the final stop, I am normally the only person left in the carriage, which I am more than okay with, as it means no one has to sit next to me.

As the train slowed to ready itself for the next station, I felt my hairs stand on end once more. I sighed at myself. 

“Not again” I thought, wishing that my brain would stop playing tricks on me. It was clearly hanging onto the dream more than I had thought, and was not letting not go any time soon. The train slowed to a halt, and the doors hissed open to allow any passengers to get off. It was a quiet station in the evening, and so the platform was deserted, save for the shape of a lone person standing at the far end of the platform. It had been raining, and so my window was covered in thin streams of water, obscuring the figure and making it seem as though they were a strange shape - almost as if you were looking at yourself in a funhouse mirror. Their body seemed twisted and deformed, no longer even resembling the shape of a human. The thought of it sent more chills down my spine, and as the doors hissed shut and the train pulled off, I silently thanked the gods that we weren’t delayed.

When I climbed into bed that night, I prayed that my brain wouldn’t force me to experience another one of its concoctions, and that I would just be able to forget the whole thing had ever happened. But my mind, once again, had other plans.

I was standing in the middle of a crowded street, streams of people passing around me. I glanced down and found that I was dressed in my work clothes, consisting of a shirt, tie and smart pants. I felt at the tie, and let it slip through my fingers. The silk felt so real. I looked back up to the street and found myself surrounded by staring faces. Everyone had stopped what they were doing and were staring at me, their mouths hanging slightly open in a look of shock and awe. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. All those sat in coffee shops, in the flats above me, and in cars all stared at me through the glass of their windows, the same expressions resting on their faces. They were unmoving, unbreathing, unfeeling. All emission had drained from them, as though they were statues.

And then as one, they took a step closer. Faces squished against the windows as those inside the buildings tried to get closer, seemingly unaware there was something in the way. I began to panic as the space between me and the crowd lessened as they moved closer once more. They were a single organism, moving together as though the individual bodies were simply limbs controlled by one malevolent force. There was now only a meter between me and the nearest person, and this gap was closed before I was able to react. I felt hands grabbing at me, ripping my shirt, grasping my tie and pulling it, tightening it’s grip around my throat and cutting off my oxygen supply. 

“Please… stop!” I choked, pushing and shoving at the mass of bodies, desperate to get them away. I was met with a deafening reply, as every mouth began chanting the same thing. My memory of what they were saying is pretty hazy, but from what I can remember, it sounded something like,

“Uy ma e, em era uy”

The voices were dark, inhuman. I felt as though my eardrums would burst at the volume of the chanting, the vibrations reverberating through my body. I was being crushed from all sides, my clothes being ripped off, my skin being ripped at and scratched by unrelenting hands. I cried out in pain, and as with the previous night, I was awake, still screaming.

I looked at my hands and found that I was shaking. My ears were ringing, as though they had been exposed to a high volume in the night. I picked up my phone and checked the time - 5:47. 

“Screw it.” I thought to myself, there wasn’t a chance I was going back to sleep after that. I climbed out of bed and walked to my bathroom. I splashed cold water onto my face in an attempt to wake myself up and make me think rationally about the situation. All that had really happened was I had had a couple of bad dreams, and seen two people obscured by various things. That was it. Nothing unnatural about that. I breathed slower now, the rational side of my brain slowly beginning to take hold.

As I brought my head back up to look at myself in the mirror, I noticed a shadow standing in my shower, obscured by the shower curtain that had been pulled across. I gasped and my blood ran cold. I was frozen by fear as I stared into the reflection. Whoever was in the shower was facing the mirror as well, their shape clearly visible. They were unmoving, as still as a statue.

I slowly turned myself around to face the curtain, the shape of the intruder still visible. Tears began to form in my eyes as I reached out a hand. I grasped the fabric, and in one quick motion, yanked the curtain across to expose the figure.

It was empty. I let out an audible mix of relief and fear as I brought my shaking hands up to my head.

I went into work early that day.

I couldn’t really focus properly on what I was doing, my mind filled with thoughts of my follower. Whatever it was, it wasn’t a figment of my imagination. I had definitely seen a figure standing in my bathroom, watching me. It had been in my flat. Feet away from me.

I travelled home as usual, thankfully not having the feeling I was being watched at all. I stepped off the train onto the platform and followed the few others that had got off down the nearby stairs that led to the exit. The stairs lead down to a small tunnel under the station, lit by crappy lights that flicker occasionally. At the end of the tunnel is a corner where a set of stairs live, leading up to the entrance of the station. Next to this corner is a mirror, placed onto the wall near the ceiling, allowing you to see if anyone is about to turn the corner, preventing you from bumping into them. As I neared the corner, I glanced up at the mirror, and found that there was someone standing just round it. They were wearing a shirt that seemed to be two sizes too small for them and a tie that looked as though it was choking them. A mass of lumpy skin bulged through the gaps between the shirt’s buttons. I stopped in my tracks, just before the corner. I looked into the mirror closer, and even though they were hunched over, I could see that the person’s head was deformed, as though it was just piles of skin thrown together clumsily. I could hear it wheezing, as if the simple act of breathing was causing it immense pain. I could feel tears beginning to well in my eyes again as I felt my hairs stand on end once more.

“Shit, shit shit.” I whispered to myself, trying to hype myself up just enough to make the three steps to the turn. Every part of my body wanted to turn around and run in the opposite direction, but I resisted. I was startled by a shout from behind me, and turned around to see the cause, only to find a group of kids running down the steps, cheering and joking with each other. I turned back to face the mirror, and found that the figure was gone again. Just like in the morning. I took a few shaky steps forward and turned the corner, confirming that there was no one there.

And then last night, I had the worst dream yet.

I found myself standing back in my bathroom, brushing my teeth. I could taste the mint of the toothpaste as I brushed, spitting out the foam into the sink below. I brought my head back up and stared at myself in the mirror. I was met with a twisted, deformed version of myself, smiling maniacally at me. I stepped backwards, and he stepped forwards, his head protruding from the glass as though it were an open window. A crooked, broken hand reached up onto the frame, and in one smooth motion, the body slithered out pulling itself through. It flopped onto the sink, smacking its head onto the porcelain and causing it to bleed. I fell backwards as I retreated, stumbling into the bathtub. I sat and watched in horror as the being got to its feet, the bones cracking as it twisted it’s broken body around to face me. The mirror-me continued to smile as he began to move towards me. At this point, I was paralyzed with fear as he began the same chant as the previous night.

“Uy ma e, em era uy. Uy ma e, em era uy.”

“Please… please don’t hurt me!” I cried as the shaking, twisted hands reached out towards my face. I turned my face away from the creature and braced myself for the inevitable. 

When I opened them again, I was back in my bed. My breathing was heavy, and my head hurt. I groaned as I sat up. I raised my hand and rested it on my forehead, trying to nurse the pain. When I made contact with my skin, I found that I was covered in something sticky. I pulled my hand away and grabbed my phone, shining the torch onto my palm.

It was covered in blood.

I felt my forehead again and could feel a deep cut in the flesh. I winced in pain as I touched it, and realized that the wound was extremely fresh. I tried my best to clean the wound in the bathroom, and wrapped a bandage from my first aid kit around my head.

In the hallway outside my flat, the lights are controlled by a movement sensor. It’s pretty bad, and only stays on for a few seconds, even if you keep moving. As I walk back to my bedroom, I notice that the light is on outside. I walk up to the door, and double check the lock. The light goes off as I get nearer, but as I turn away from the door, I see it switch back on, the light glowing under the door. 

I move back into my bedroom, and open my laptop. That is where I am now, writing this, asking for help. I don’t know what to do, or how I can stop this. All I know is that whatever is following me, it’s getting closer, more confident.

Her favorites got the first choice of time off, first choice of lunch break times, were able to just walk away from their desks and chat, leaving everyone else to handle all the workload.  When the higher ups ordered mandatory OT for everyone, we were offered the option to come in early to stay later. I chose coming in early. I was always at my desk by 6:45AM, logged onto my computer with the most used apps pulled up, ready to start at 7. Those who chose to stay late would arrive for either 8 or 8:30 start times. But the favorites - they turned up at 1 minute before their start time. They would sign on their phones, put it in ""away"" and go to the break room for coffee and chat. Meanwhile, those of us who were not ""favored"" by the boss, plugged away at our desks.

This boss was able to get away with allowing her ""favorites"" to pull this stuff because, well, according to office gossip, she was involved with the gentleman who was in overall charge of our location. To be sure, every time he came to see her in her office, the door would be shut and we, the whole team, had orders not to disturb her. If we needed a supervisor for any reason, we were to go to one of the other team leaders. 

I finally decided that I could no longer tolerate the environment in that office and resigned, since my job was moving out of state anyway. 

I hear from a few who are still there, that this person is still the same. The gentleman who was/is in overall charge is now divorced - a messy one because his wife heard the gossip. She is still married, but according to those still in the office, they live apart.

As for me, leaving was the best thing I could have done. I was working 10-12 hours a day every day; some days longer.  It was taking a toll on my physical and mental health. 

But sometimes I wonder if I was the AH for leaving. I wonder, should I have stayed and moved to a different team or even moved with the job out of state.  I know that the day a left, that night I slept better than I had for several years.  I actually slept for nearly 10 hours, which I guess just indicates how exhausted I was from the OT and the office politics.

By: Roy Thigpen  
  
 \[Verse 1\]  
backstage shadows in the glow of the heat  
laying out the cables, always on their feet  
holding the scenery so it doesn't fall apart  
never complaining, they give it all their heart  
  
\[Verse 2\]  
They wake up when the day's just begun  
Coffee in hand, they work till it's done  
Double check to ensure all is right  
So that the crowd can rock out tonight!  
  
\[Chorus 1\]  
they build kingdoms that stand for only a day  
tearing them down and hauling them away  
invisible soldiers that nobody sees  
the ghost whose call is behind the scenes  
  
\[Verse 3\]  
Sweating in silence, echoes from the heart  
setting the stage, a perfect work of art  
no roaring crowd to greet them every night  
fade into the shadows, after bringing the light  
  
\[Verse 4\]  
You don't know them, but we do, and we care  
With steel-toed shoes, going where no one will dare  
Facing risks each and every single day  
So this little band can get up here and play!  
  
\[Chorus 2\]  
they build kingdoms that stand for only a day  
tearing them down and hauling them away  
silent ninjas that can go anywhere,  
you can't see them, but trust me, they're there  
  
\[Verse 5\]  
Dreams burn like stage lights and flicker unseen  
They call that a passion from behind the scene  
never the spotlight but they hold it strong  
their anthem unheard but still a part of the song  
  
\[Chorus 3\]   
they build kingdoms that stand for only a day  
tearing them down and hauling them away  
silent sherpas that carry our load  
My friends who help me go on the road!  
  
\[Bridge\]  
Next time you're at a show  
take a moment, watch them flow  
Like ghosts, they're out of sight  
Crafting wonders each and every night  
  
You won't see them, but they're always near  
The same faces, year after year  
They triple-check with studied precision  
so we can achieve our musical vision  
  
\[Chorus 4\]  
they build kingdoms that stand for only a day  
tearing them down and hauling them away  
background wizards working their schemes,  
the spirits who help to realize my dream  
  
 \[Outro\]   
Without them, there would be no show  
No voices heard, no stage aglow  
Long after the lights are down  
and the band's on to another town  
they're still working hard, packing it all away  
just to set it all back up the next day.

I’m back after a post yesterday that got a lot of gold (and snark) — and I’m honestly grateful for both. 🙏

After hearing how brutal resume screening, outreach, and ATS software can be, I’m building something I wish already existed:

🧠 An AI recruiting assistant that doesn’t suck.

It’s designed to:

	•	Instantly score and rank applicants based on actual fit (not just keywords),

	•	Generate personalized outreach messages so you don’t have to copy/paste 100 times,

	•	And eventually plug into whatever ATS or spreadsheet hell you’re already using.

No BS, no sales pitch — I’m still early. Right now, the site just has a waitlist and a disabled login/signup.

But I want to build this with recruiters, not in a vacuum.

So here’s what I’m wondering today:

	•	What’s the most painful part of your current process you wish AI could handle — but you’re skeptical it ever will?

	•	If you’ve tried tools like this before — what made them flop?

	•	And what would actually make you trust an AI to rank candidates?

If this hits close to home or you’re just curious, I’d love to keep you in the loop (or show a sneak peek once I have something demo-ready). Appreciate all of you keeping it real — keep the coffee strong and the resumes short",4,1752868016.0,recruitinghell,3,1.0,False

Could be anything from cringe hairstyles, slang you never used, activities, you name it. 

I’m definitely guilty of some that I’m not proud of. I downloaded TikTok. My first house is/was doused in Millennial gray paint (in fairness, it came that way, I didn’t paint it that color) and furniture. I posted vague, cryptic Facebook statuses. I used to say doggo/pupper (I still hate myself for that). 

Two stand out for me that I didn’t participate in:

**Vaping** is the first one. 

No shade if you vape, I’m just glad I never started. The first time I remember noticing someone vape was in 2011-2012 when I saw my coworker vaping at work. This was before it had really taken off and before most places started forbidding it indoors. The coworker was already kind of a douche, but I told him he probably shouldn’t be doing that at work (I was his supervisor), and he got super defensive and said “It’s just water vapor bro” as he proceeded to blow a cloud in my face.

Vaping absolutely blew up in the years after. It was touted as a safe(r) alternative to cigarettes, but so many people I know started their nicotine dependence by vaping.

As a side note, I do think nicotine itself is unfairly demonized because while it is addictive, a strong argument can be made that it’s actually good for you in moderation. Lots of studies have come out recently showing it’s a good nootropic and that it has neuroprotective qualities that protect against dementia and Parkinson’s; it’s just that most methods of consuming it are bad for you and outweigh the benefits. It would be like if caffeine the chemical was good for you, but coffee was a carcinogen.

**Tattoos** are the other one. 

I’m not anti-tattoo by any means. I actually really like tattoos, but I haven’t personally found something I cared enough about to have it permanently inked onto my body (yet). When I turned 18, my friends kept pressuring me to get one. Ironically, they became so common and ubiquitous among my peers that it became more “rebellious” to _not_ get one. 

I want my first one to be something really significant. There have been a few things in the past that I thought would be good candidates, but at this point I think I would have regretted them. So while I’m happy I didn’t follow that trend, it’s more because I would have been succumbing to peer pressure and following a fad than getting something I really care about.",1,1752867987.0,Millennials,23,0.67,False

I started with Character AI, but everything I wrote got filtered or watered down, even if it wasn’t that wild. Then I gave Janitor a try. The personality tone was better, but it kept forgetting stuff mid-convo, which made longer chats kind of annoying.

Then I found Nectar AI, and the setup’s different. No sliders or menus, you just write out a full prompt and it builds the character around that. I figured why not test it by making a vampire girlfriend who’s over-the-top dramatic, speaks like she’s in a Victorian novel, and lowkey hates humans.

I gave her a background like “eternal royalty who’s bitter about modern life and only listens to orchestral music.” Not even kidding by message five, she was calling me a “pitiful spark in the ashes of time” because I suggested she try iced coffee. I lost it lol.

Then I made a second version of her but changed the tone completely. Same lore, but this one was shy, curious about human stuff, and kinda insecure about being a vampire. Totally different vibe, and it actually felt like two separate people responding to the same prompts.

I wasn’t planning on turning this into a whole storyline. I was just curious tbh. But now I’m kinda invested and thinking about turning them into rivals or something.",1,1752867846.0,AIRelationships,0,1.0,False

The day prior to that I had a physical during which I got dizzy/lightheaded, heard buzzing in my ears and had to lie down. but this was right after having a pap smear so i chalked it up to having been nervous for that. 


because of the dizzy spell and the low glucose the doctor ordered a recheck of the same metabolic panel test and also hemoglobin a1c and insulin. i have yet to get those done. 


earlier this year my mom mentioned that she thought i was having hypoglycemic episodes because i would get extremely hungry, shaky, dizzy, and basically feel like im walking underwater, speaking feels difficult, walking feels difficult, every sound is louder etc i pretty much just feel horrible until i eat and then i feel stable again a bit after eating but i still don’t feel 100%.  


i also get full very quickly when eating, ill be starving and can’t wait to eat but then i can only eat a bit of my food before i’m full.. then shortly after ill be starving again with very little warning. the physical symptoms start so quickly i can pinpoint exactly when it happened and feel the shift. 


i don’t know if maybe these symptoms are normal and the test was a mistake, but now my mom is freaking out and wanting me to come home and get the tests done asap. i feel normal and think it’s not that urgent, but could it be? or is it something i can take my time with figuring out?

1m3bskg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1m3bskg/married_people_would_you_accept_it_if_your/,"Married people, would you accept it if your partner engaged in a similar emotional / intellectual relationship without ever mentioning you to the other person?","Months ago, I met a man I really clicked with at a work event we had both traveled to. We had unusually beautiful and deep conversations twice over coffee, during which I also opened up to him about my personal situation (soon to be divorced). I did not ask him about his personal circumstances or whether he had someone in his life and he didn’t volunteer anything either. We just parted ways admitting that we were so happy to have met each other and that we should absolutely not lose touch in the future.

Two weeks later, he sent me a message reminiscing on some past childhood memories from our home country (we both left our country years ago because of the war). I reciprocated with an equally sentimental message, kicking off a 6-months long back and forth letter-writing relationship during which we almost became each other’s diaries.

The letters (which we would send every three or four days) were emotional, personal, and philosophically/ psychologically dense, but never sexual or romantic. It felt more like we had built a space we both needed to help each other with what we were going through in life. However, he often mentioned how much he “admired me”, how “lucky” he felt to have met someone like me, how “dark” his life was before I entered it, and how “essential” I had become to him. He said he could not explain our “bond” but that our “writing” space and my presence in his life was so “vital” to him and his well being.

Naturally, me being a hardcore sapiophile (and a giver/ fixer), I ended up developing feelings for him, although I never thought of asking if he had someone in his life. I did not ask because I was almost embarrassed, because I felt that his answer would certainly be “how can I have a gf/ wife and still write to you the way I do?” I also felt that if he had someone in his life, he would have put a stop to my writing, which was starting to show a bit more “emotion” and sentimentality over time. So I never asked him. And he never said anything.

Fast forward a few months, as he was telling me again how much he admired me and how rare it was for him to be this impressed by someone for this long, I finally asked him. It wasn’t a straightforward question, but it was enough for him to get the message: I needed to know.

His answer left me speechless for days. It turned out, not only did he have someone he “was in love with” in his life. She was also pregnant. He then went on to say that he had told her about me right after meeting me and that she knew about my importance in his life. He said that he would not change a single word or feeling in our correspondence, even if she is to one day read our letters. However, he did admit that he did not show her our conversations because the intimacy in them was as much mine as it was his, and that would “not be right”.

After I recovered from the initial shock, I wrote back telling him that it was very unfair to keep his gf a secret from the beginning and that even though I never “asked”, he could have at least mentioned her or their future child in his letters at some point. He told me SO many things about his life, his parents, friends, and coworkers… so how could he have possibly eclipsed the most important person in his life?

I ended my note admitting that I had grown feelings for him along the way and that he had hurt me deeply.  He apologized profusely, saying that hurting me was never the intention, that he really only wanted us all (including his gf) to be friends (almost like family) one day, and that he needs me to stay in his life because he has never experienced a bond like ours before and it would be a shame to throw such a beautiful relationship away because of some social norms and “should be’s”.

He is even suggesting now introducing me to her. I really do not know what to think of all this and of his reaction (which is making me feel like I am the crazy one here). I don’t know if he was engaging in a light emotional affair, which he then denied because I told him off, or if he really genuinely only wanted to have a platonic relationship from the beginning. He’s a very smart person but I suspect he is also a bit neurodivergent (and is a bit of an “artistic/ philosopher” type) so I am not sure if that is why we both drew two completely different (though both equally intense) impressions from the very same experience.

I really want to be mad at him and walk away but another part of me is wondering if I am overreacting, and if I just allowed myself to fall for something that I imagined, that never really existed. But then again,  I put myself in his gf’s shoes and think that I would be very upset in her place… that what he did was hurtful, even if she knew a bit about my existence and importance in his life.

Am I right to feel this way, or AIO? Would you married men and women accept it if your partner engaged in something similar without mentioning you for months (until asked)? ",2,1752867415.0,Marriage,10,1.0,False

I own a 2014 Kia Optima EX with just under 185,000 miles on it. The engine has been burning oil for quite some time so I have been monitoring that closely and topping it off in addition to getting regular oil changes. 

On Tuesday of this week (it’s now Friday), I left for work on my usual route and I stopped at a stoplight. I was at a full and complete stop with the break fully applied, and suddenly my car started shuddering, it sounded like the engine was revving and then suddenly my car violently jolted forward. So much so that I thought I got rear ended. I threw it in park for a second until the light turned green not knowing what was happening and when the light turned green, I put it in drive continued on, and I was able to get on the freeway and drive to work as usual. However, when I got to work, I tried to reverse into a parking spot, and the car was jolting, and it felt like it was fighting me to go in reverse.

I called my car guy and had it towed to him because I thought it was a motor mount problem after looking at it with my boss, but my car guy said that it is the transmission. He drained the existing fluid which was dark brown like coffee, and he added some new fluid and also an additive to help revive the transmission. He told me to drive it around for the next week or so to try and break it in, but that there is a 50-50 chance that it will be OK. He told me to ease into braking and pushing the gas.

I drove around for a bit last night and it is quite difficult to drive. 

At one point I drove on a slightly downhill road. Didn’t push the gas, just tapped the brakes every so often. When I got to the bottom, I stopped to turn right, and as soon as I turned right it made the loudest bang, jolted so hard and made some other noise I can’t remember. I thought I killed it. I was so scared and nervous my whole body was on fire. 

I couldn’t get it over 35 mph because it kept slipping, and it’s doing the jolt thing when I’m braking too. Every time I would stop at a light, it took like a good mile to even get it up to 20 mph. I don’t think it’s gonna get better.

I think I may be SOL. 

This is where I need advice:

I’m a 28 year old female. I took a collateral loan against this car a few years ago I owe just over $5000 on this car. It has some major paint chipping problems because of Kia‘s faulty white paint. I have a large 12 inch wide paint peeling on the trunk lid, as well as on the roof rails. I also have a dent in the front bumper. I am just wondering if anyone thinks that I could get anything out of this car to help me pay down what I owe on it still. Or if you have any other advice on how to move forward. I am at a loss and quite emotionally exhausted from this car and it is just not worth the trouble for me anymore. I don’t have much liquid cash to pay for a new transmission nor do I really want to dump anymore money into this car because it isn’t worth much at all. I would like to get into something new and I’ve been looking at Toyotas.

College

My SIL and I met in college in 2012 and I was very friendly and made friends easily, while she did not. She once said, ""I didn't come to college to make friends."" But I befriended her anyway and we became close friends and eventually called eachother ""best friends"". I had other friends during this time and a couple of others I would have called ""best friend"", so she was never the only friend in the picture.

After college

After we graduated was when I started to notice some things I didn't like about her. She made snide comments all the time, was very negative, and always complained about something. It got to the point where I anticipated what she was going to complain about in every conversation. It was tiring but I kept on being her friend and planning coffee dates multiple times a month.

Side note: I am a Christian. I am a loving person and have delt with people's negative personalities for a long time and just kept hanging on to relationships that did not serve me in the name of ""loyalty"". My first friendship break-up was when I was 30 years old. I have grown up with a people-pleasing tendency. I have gone to counseling about this and am actively working on it. No more dealing with pleasing people and always being the nice one. I am done.

I kept being friends with her and just felt like this was probably part of normal friendship. We have a lot in common and have had good times but after all the negativity I felt myself pulling away and not planning as many things with her.

The Awkward Moment (2023-ish)

Fast forward several years. I got married to her brother (who is so different from her, he is an amazing person). I got pregnant a few months after my ""former best friend"" turned SIL went through a miscarriage. I visited her and brought her a meal and some cookies. I cried with her and spent 3 hours with her that day. I didn't bring up the miscarriage after that.

Then I noticed that she ignored me for 2 months. We went to a few get-togethers with friends and she did not say hi or even make eye contact with me at all. So I decided to confront her about it. When I did she said that ""I was not there for her"" when she went through her miscarriage. I felt really bad and apologized but that has always bothered me because I thought that spending 3 hours with her and bringing her a meal was ""being there for her"". Was I the only friend she was relying on her to ""be there for her""?...I never talked to her about this though.

Present-day

I have never felt comfortable around her since then. I don't feel like getting together. I dread family get togethers (which are mostly on major holidays, thankfully). I just get an icky feeling/vibe from her now. I think that she thinks everything is fine/normal between us. I think it is years of built up resentment/bitterness on my part. I wish I told her how I felt years ago, but now it probably won't solve anything. Even if I were to bring it up, she's not going to change and it might make things worse between us and awkward at familiy gatherings.

She doesn't have many close friends (she will even admit that) and I now understand why after all these years.

I am about to have baby #2 and she is pregnant with her first. I don't really feel excited for her, just indifferent. She is just a SIL to me, not a best friend but I feel obligated to involve her/invite her to things. I definitely don't initiate anything/text her unless I absolutely need to. I've definitely distanced, but what should I do from now on? Especially since out kids will most likely be growing up together in the same city.",1,1752867273.0,WhatShouldIDo,4,1.0,False

1m3bpkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/1m3bpkk/recovery_story/,Recovery story,"Context: I started being bulimic (strictly purging) in my senior year of high school (approx 19 years old). I’m now 30. The first 2 years was purging once or twice a week. The 4 years after that was HEAVY purging (3/4x per day) and i finally stopped around the age of 25. But then i started using stimulant laxatives. The first year was only once or twice a week (with some, but much less purging, probably 3x a month). Then the purging nearly stopped, but from years 27-30 I abused stimulant laxatives (one stimulant lax per day, sometimes two).

Lots of things were happening in my life around this time too - from family issues to having terrible boyfriends and a very shitty demanding job.

But then at 28, i met the best guy in the world and got my dream job that has the actual best work life balance, with double the salary. So basically, for the first time in 15 years, i had nothing causing me anxiety, self consciousness, or anything else. That’s when i decided that i would fix the last “issue” in my life - my dependencies on good old laxatives.

Throughout the last two years, I’ve had bouts of quitting that lasted 1-2 weeks. What was encouraging was that i met with a nutritionist and she told me that yes, 5 years is considered a long term addiction, but that only taking 1 stimulant lax per day was not terrible, and that lasting damage wasn’t in the picture yet. In those bouts of quitting, we proved that by the fact that i was still able to go to the bathroom with the help of miralax/fibre supplements.

Fast forward five days ago. I got inspired and finally decided to stop for real. I realized that my main motivation was to have a flat stomach. And if that’s all it was, and it was achievable with or without laxatives, why not do it without??

So I’m on day 5 and came here to 1. Write my story, 2. Tell people who are going through similar journeys about my progress and 3. Ask for encouraging comments! I realized that the more i celebrate each day that i don’t take a laxative, the more motivated i feel to keep going!

Here’s my daily journal so far: Day 1 (July 15): took Mira + fiber morning and once at night. Not bloated yet. No poop. Day 2: took Mira+fiber morning and night. Had my first tiny urge to poop, and had a very small relief after a chia seed pudding. Bloating is getting bigger. Day 3: first normal poop in the morning, and another one after lunch! Felt relief for the first time in 3 days, but bloating is getting worse. Same as the other days w Mira+fiber (morning + night). Feeling lethargic, but not sure if that’s from bloating or not sleeping enough. Day 4: bloating is still bad, but hasn’t gotten worse. First day feeling energized enough to workout, which honestly felt sooo good. One poop after coffee, and another after lunch! Feeling like good progress.

The future: I’ve read a bunch of threads and done research - the bloating is normal, comes from water retention and the fact that, simply, I’m not pooping as much so there’s just more stuff in there. It’ll be really important to commit to this and control any binge eating and watching what i eat. I’ve read that it’ll take 4-6 weeks for the bloating to go away completely. I’m almost a week in and already feeling relief so i can’t wait until week 4.",1,1752867213.0,bulimia,1,1.0,False

But then i started using stimulant laxatives. The first year was only once or twice a week (with some, but much less purging, probably 3x a month). Then the purging nearly stopped, but from years 27-30 I abused stimulant laxatives (one stimulant lax per day, sometimes two).

Lots of things were happening in my life around this time too - from family issues to having terrible boyfriends and a very shitty demanding job.

But then at 28, i met the best guy in the world and got my dream job that has the actual best work life balance, with double the salary. So basically, for the first time in 15 years, i had nothing causing me anxiety, self consciousness, or anything else. That’s when i decided that i would fix the last “issue” in my life - my dependencies on good old laxatives.

Throughout the last two years, I’ve had bouts of quitting that lasted 1-2 weeks. What was encouraging was that i met with a nutritionist and she told me that yes, 5 years is considered a long term addiction, but that only taking 1 stimulant lax per day was not terrible, and that lasting damage wasn’t in the picture yet. In those bouts of quitting, we proved that by the fact that i was still able to go to the bathroom with the help of miralax/fibre supplements.

Fast forward five days ago. I got inspired and finally decided to stop for real. I realized that my main motivation was to have a flat stomach. And if that’s all it was, and it was achievable with or without laxatives, why not do it without??

So I’m on day 5 and came here to 1. Write my story, 2. Tell people who are going through similar journeys about my progress and 3. Ask for encouraging comments! I realized that the more i celebrate each day that i don’t take a laxative, the more motivated i feel to keep going!

Here’s my daily journal so far: Day 1 (July 15): took Mira + fiber morning and once at night. Not bloated yet. No poop. Day 2: took Mira+fiber morning and night. Had my first tiny urge to poop, and had a very small relief after a chia seed pudding. Bloating is getting bigger. Day 3: first normal poop in the morning, and another one after lunch! Felt relief for the first time in 3 days, but bloating is getting worse. Same as the other days w Mira+fiber (morning + night). Feeling lethargic, but not sure if that’s from bloating or not sleeping enough. Day 4: bloating is still bad, but hasn’t gotten worse. First day feeling energized enough to workout, which honestly felt sooo good. One poop after coffee, and another after lunch! Feeling like good progress.

The future: I’ve read a bunch of threads and done research - the bloating is normal, comes from water retention and the fact that, simply, I’m not pooping as much so there’s just more stuff in there. It’ll be really important to commit to this and control any binge eating and watching what i eat. I’ve read that it’ll take 4-6 weeks for the bloating to go away completely.

The story is 100% real!


---

Hey everyone!

Wearing leggings in public as a man can feel intimidating.

But what helps the most is hearing other people’s experiences.

So I’d like to share mine.

And if it helps you feel more confident — I’d love to hear your story too! 😁



I usually wear leggings in three situations:
at home, at the gym, and when I travel (especially on planes).

I don’t wear leggings that show a visible bulge — I find that too revealing and kind of vulgar.
Instead, I wear tight underwear that makes the front area look smooth and flat.

I think it looks better and feels more appropriate in public.




One time, I wore dark grey leggings with a black long-sleeve shirt to the gym. I was doing leg exercises on a machine and taking turns with a woman. When she finished, she looked at me and said:

“By the way, nice outfit! Can I ask what brand your leggings are? Where did you get them?”

We ended up having a nice chat after that.




Another time, at the airport, I wore plain black Lululemon leggings (women’s fit) with a navy blue hoodie that stopped mid-cheek.

And guess what?
No one cared. At all.
People were too busy doing their own thing.

Honestly, it’s totally normal now for men to wear leggings — people have seen it plenty of times.
It’s just another outfit, especially in situations where comfort matters.




When I got on the plane, I sat next to a woman in her mid-20s.
Funny enough, she was wearing almost the exact same outfit as me — black Lululemon leggings and a slightly lighter blue hoodie.

She stood up to let me into my window seat. As I passed by, she glanced at my outfit and gave me a warm smile — like she was silently saying, “Nice choice.”

After takeoff, I decided to start a conversation.

I said:
“We look like twins!” (referring to our matching outfits)

She laughed and said:
“Right?! I wanted to tell you I like your outfit but I was too shy.”

I replied:
“Thanks! I like yours too. It’s the perfect outfit for traveling, right?”

She nodded:
“Absolutely! Once you travel in Lulus, you never go back.”

Then I asked:
“Is this the first time you’ve seen a guy wearing leggings on a flight?”

She said:
“Not at all! I used to be a flight attendant for Air Canada in my early twenties — I saw that all the time.”

I was surprised.
“Really? I didn’t think it was that common. Did you and your coworkers ever talk about it when a guy wore leggings?”

She laughed and said:
“No, never. Why would we? Just like when women wear leggings, nobody talks about it. People wear what they want — no one really cares.”

We kept chatting, exchanged Instagram handles, and later realized we both had a layover — so we grabbed a coffee together in the terminal. (See photo)

We still talk every now and then!



So yeah — for me, wearing leggings in public gave me way more than just comfort.
It actually helped me meet new people.

And truly, people don’t care if a guy is wearing leggings. You’d be surprised how little attention it gets. 😂

Wear them when you go shopping, hang out with friends, go to the gym, or travel.
No one will care — and chances are, you’ll get compliments from women!



I hope my story inspired you to feel a little more confident. 😊



Now it’s your turn — let’s hear YOUR stories! 😁

Have you ever gotten compliments while wearing leggings?

Did a conversation ever start because of it?

How do people usually react?

1m3b83d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1m3b83d/how_finding_enjoyment_in_your_gmat_prep_can/,How Finding Enjoyment in Your GMAT Prep Can Improve Your Results,"Whether you're talking about your job or your GMAT preparation, one of the most effective ways to stay motivated is to enjoy what you're doing. When you find fulfillment or satisfaction in your work, showing up consistently becomes much easier. Conversely, when you dread what you are doing, it is difficult to give your best effort, no matter how ambitious your goals may be.

Your GMAT preparation is no different. If you can find enjoyment in the process of studying, you will be much more motivated to dedicate the necessary hours to your prep. You will also build positive momentum. When studying feels like an opportunity rather than a chore, it becomes easier to stay consistent. That consistency is what leads to real progress.

If you're struggling to enjoy your GMAT prep, it can help to step back and reconnect with your reasons for embarking on this journey. A high GMAT score opens doors to some of the world’s best MBA programs. Beyond admissions, the skills you sharpen while preparing for the GMAT — critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, reading comprehension, and data analysis — are directly applicable in business school and in your career.

Try reframing how you view your study sessions. Rather than seeing them as a checklist item to grind through, view them as training for the type of analytical work you will need to succeed in business. See them as an opportunity to strengthen your problem-solving abilities, enhance your attention to detail, and improve your resilience when faced with complex challenges.

Here are some practical ways to help you find more enjoyment in your prep:

* Break your study into small, achievable goals. The satisfaction of meeting these goals can help sustain motivation.
* Track your progress over time. Seeing how far you have come is often rewarding in itself.
* Allow yourself moments to appreciate your improvement. Whether it is solving a problem faster or mastering a difficult topic, take time to recognize your growth.
* Mix up your routine when possible. Alternate between Quant and Verbal, vary the types of practice problems, and include different study resources to keep things fresh.
* Study in environments that you find enjoyable or relaxing. A favorite coffee shop or quiet library can make a difference.

Finally, remember that this effort is temporary, but the benefits will last long after you finish the exam. Studying for the GMAT is not just about earning a score. It is about building habits and skills that will serve you well in business school and beyond.

If you can shift your mindset to see your GMAT prep as an opportunity rather than an obligation, you will give yourself the best possible chance of success.

Reach out to me with any questions about your GMAT prep. Happy studying!

I just want to share the story of my absurd marriage. It’s so outrageous that I still have a hard time believing that this actually happened to me. This post is a bit long, but I already condensed it as much as I could. I can probably write a book on this if I wanted to. **Note, this is a 100% true story, it is not fiction and definitely not AI generated. Happy to provide evidence to the moderators if needed.**

My ex-wife and I were married for almost 9 years, but we only lived together for about 1.5 years. She didn’t live with me because she was “studying for PhD” and busy “looking for employment”. In November 2022, she abruptly wanted a divorce, and asked for half of my assets and spousal support. In April 2023, I accidentally found a Chick-fil-A cup in my garage with the name of a man that I never heard of. After several months of investigation, I found out that the man is her boyfriend from when they were in China, and they have been living together whenever the wife was not with me, in multiple cities across the United States.

Almost everything this woman ever told me were lies. In addition, both the woman and the man are incredibly strange and secretive. A lot of what they did is beyond my imagination and comprehension. Who are they? What are they doing in the United States? I got dragged into a legal battle with this person that I hardly knew, and it took a tremendous toll on me mentally, physically, and financially.

# Background

The two of them and I were born in the same city in China, but I never met them when I was in China. I came to the United States with my parents when I was in grade school, and I have lived in California since. I currently work in the tech industry in Silicon Valley.

The woman used to work for a consulting firm in Shanghai. She came to the United States in 2012 to study for PhD in the East Coast. We met online shortly after she came to the US, were in a long-distance relationship for more than a year, and got married in January 2014. Up until the end of 2024, she never had a full time job in the United States.

The man and the woman were high school classmates. He used to work for the Chinese Navy and then a tech company in Shanghai. He came to the United States in 2015 to study for PhD in Virginia. He later worked for a semiconductor company in Silicon Valley.

For the remainder of this post, I will refer to the woman as Paris and the man as Sharik. **Disclaimer, Paris and Sharik are not their real names.**

# The marriage

Before we were married, Paris told me multiple times she planned to drop out of the PhD program after completing the Master’s requirements, and then move to California in summer 2014 and look for a job.

Shortly after we were married, Paris told me she was making very good progress in her PhD, and it would be a shame to drop out. She said she wanted to complete the degree, and she could probably finish in less than 4 years. What she said made sense, and I wanted to be a supportive husband, so I agreed. Around the same time, she also told me she found a summer internship at Baidu in Shanghai, so she can’t spend summer 2014 with me in California.

In summer 2015, Paris again went to “intern” at Baidu in Shanghai. After returning, she confirmed that the upcoming school year will be her final year, and that she will come to California as soon as she graduates.

Summer 2016 came around and Paris had not graduated, but she said she’s almost done. It is very common for PhDs to take more than four years, so I didn’t suspect anything. She told me she didn’t lease an apartment for the upcoming school year because she will be graduating soon, instead she lived in the living room of a friend’s apartment.

From that point forward, she always told me she would graduate in a couple months whenever the topic came up. It’s pretty common for PhDs to be delayed, so I still didn’t suspect anything. During this time, Paris no longer allowed me to visit her on the East Coast, because she’s living in her friend’s living room, so it’s inappropriate and inconvenient for me to stay here.  She did however come visit me in California several times during this period, but some of those trips were also for her USCIS appointments.

In April 2018, Paris finally moved to California. She still hasn’t graduated, but she said her advisor allowed her to work on her dissertation in California. For the remainder of 2018, she went to the East Coast several times to “meet with her advisor”, and was away for 2-3 weeks each time.

In November 2018, Paris said she will go to the East Coast one last time for her defense. I wanted to attend her defense, but she won’t let me because that will put too much pressure on her. After she “graduated” in December, she went vacationing in Miami with “friends”. I was pretty upset about this because I already planned a family vacation during Christmas which had to be canceled.

Paris was busy “job searching” after returning to California. In May 2019, she said she accepted an offer from a company in San Mateo, but she won’t tell me the name of this company. She just said it’s a small company that I probably never heard of.

On 5/20/2019, Paris left home while I was at work, only leaving a note on the dining table saying she went on a road trip. A few days later, she sent me a text saying she was in Portland, Maine. I tried calling her multiple times but no answer. I was very angry. I have been trying to plan a family vacation for the past year, but she’s always busy, yet she had several vacations without me during this time. What am I to her? I seriously contemplated separation.

On 6/1/2019, Paris called me telling me that she’s pregnant. I was ecstatic after hearing this. We have been trying to have a child since the day we were married, and now the child is finally here. Thoughts of separation were completely out the window. Paris said she was in New York at the time, but she’s afraid to fly home due to the pregnancy. She went to Washington D.C. the next day to stay with a “friend"" and saw a doctor. She didn’t return to California until 6/18/2019. After returning home, Paris said she has postponed the start date of her “new job” in order to care for the unborn baby.

On 8/27/2019, Paris told me she actually hasn’t graduated, and her advisor is now telling her to get her act together and go back to the East Coast to finish, or she can forget about her degree. She said her advisor also found her a research assistant job at University C, which is about 50 miles from her school, so she can support herself. I was very angry that she lied to me, but she’s pregnant, and it’s hard to ask her to give up her degree, so I still let her go. Paris left for the East Coast the next day. However, she didn’t live near her school, or near University C, rather she lived next to University D, which is about 10 miles away from University C. Her reason was she’s pregnant, and University D Hospital is the best hospital in the area.

In January 2020, my parents and I all went to the East Coast to welcome the birth of our child. Just one week after our daughter was born, Paris started to push us to go back to California, claiming that she can take care of the child by herself. I stayed on the East Coast till mid February, but my parents insisted on staying longer to take care of their grandchild, and they stayed until 3/5/2020.

On 3/8/2020, just 3 days after my parents returned to California, Paris brought our daughter to my parents’ house in Sacramento, saying that the child was sick and she didn't know what to do. COVID already started at this time, many companies already started WFH, and there were rumors that schools would close soon. We asked Paris to stay in California but she insisted on going back to “complete her degree”. She said she’s almost done and will return to California in April.

I lived in my parents’ house during COVID so I could care for the newborn. We asked Paris multiple times to return to California but she kept on coming up with excuses for not returning, such as not feeling well, not safe to fly during the pandemic, etc.

Paris finally returned to California at the end of September, but she won’t live with us in Sacramento, rather she “lived by herself” in our Bay Area home. She said she really needed to focus on her “job search”, and there were too many distractions in Sacramento. She said she would try to spend a few days every week in Sacramento to help take care of our daughter. In reality, she came to Sacramento about once a month, and only stayed about 2 days each time.

Paris spent the next year “job searching” but couldn’t find anything. By the end of 2021, COVID was getting better and there were rumors of RTO soon. In November, I talked to Paris about moving back to the Bay Area, but she vehemently opposed that idea, saying that I would disturb her “job searching” efforts. My parents talked to her after hearing this, telling her that husband and wife should not be living separately for this long, and Paris was visibly upset after that conversation. About a week later, she told me she needed to go to China, because her father was ill, and her parents were also trying to sell a house under her name and needed her signature. I felt that the timing of this was a bit odd because at the time China had a 28-days quarantine policy, and plane tickets were very expensive and hard to get. But it is hard to say no given her reasons. On 12/18/2021, Paris “left for China”.

Starting in January 2022, I would occasionally go work in the office, so I started living in my Bay Area home for a few days every couple weeks. In February, I started getting a lot of mail from Kaiser Permanente for Paris. I initially thought they were ads because we didn’t even use Kaiser, so I just put them aside. On 3/27/2022, I received a postcard from Kaiser which read something like “Thank you for visiting us”. This looked suspicious, so I opened one of the previous mail pieces and it showed Paris went to Kaiser Fremont on 2/7/2022. She didn’t go to China.

I was thinking what every man would have thought in that situation. I called Paris and made her come home. She swore she was not having an affair. In fact she was “angry” that I would even think she would do something so disgusting. She said she stayed in her parents’ friend’s house, because they went to China and needed someone to watch their home. She offered to show me letters from her parents as proof if I didn’t believe her. I was quite skeptical of what she said, but I had no evidence, and she looked so assertive. I then thought of our daughter, she was sick at the time. I didn’t want her to grow up in a broken family, so I chose to believe what Paris said.

From there, I continued to split my time between Sacramento and the Bay Area, while Paris continued her “job search”. In 2022, many tech companies had layoffs and hiring freezes. It was a tough job market, so I didn’t suspect anything. In July, she got a contractor position through the help of one of my mother’s friends. I initially thought the job was 40 hours/week, but a couple months later I learned that she was only working 10 hours/week. Paris said she was still looking for a full-time job while working part-time.

# The divorce

On 11/28/2022, Paris left home at 9:00am to “work at a Starbucks”, and didn’t come home until around 7:10pm. After coming home, she started arguing with me for no reason and then started throwing things. Then she suddenly screamed: “I want a divorce” and left home at around 7:20pm. I was completely baffled and had no idea what just happened.

I thought she couldn’t be serious about a divorce. We haven't had any disagreements recently. Just a couple days ago we were celebrating Thanksgiving in Sacramento, and were planning to take our daughter to Disneyland for her third birthday. Why would she suddenly want a divorce? Around 11:30pm, she came back with a rental car and started moving her stuff out. At that point I realized she was serious. She still refused to tell me what happened, and she left at around 12:30am.

The next evening, Paris came back to get some of her remaining stuff, and we talked for about an hour. She said she wanted a divorce because I didn’t treat her well. Her examples were I seldom called her and I won’t talk to her after coming home from work. Both allegations were completely false. Even if they were true, how come she never said anything before? Then she said she had been planning for this divorce for several years, and had been consulting divorce lawyers since 2019. That sentence really sent chills down my spine. So she had been plotting against me, and was just pretending all these years. From there, she gave me her proposal of asset division, essentially wanting half of my stuff, and justified her demands by throwing all kinds of legal jargon at me. She was clearly well prepared.

The next few days were the darkest of my life. This was so sudden and so unexpected, it was hard for me to even digest what just happened. I couldn’t eat or sleep, or do anything else but to think about what had just happened. She planned this for years, and she is clearly going after my money. I started looking at what happened around 2019. In December 2018, she got her green card, and I started my current job around the same time. My 4 year work anniversary is coming up soon. Initial RSU spans 4 years, and stock price went up quite a bit during COVID. This means my income will be having a large cliff soon. No wonder she kept asking about my income in the last couple years. This started to make sense now.

For the next few months, Paris constantly threatened and harassed me over the phone and texts, which brought additional trauma to the distress I suffered at the time. She came up with all kinds of false allegations, such as accusing me of abusing our daughter. She even said she already reported me to the police and the CPS, which I later learned were lies. In fact, a social worker from the CPS told me that I don’t need to respond to her messages since we are separated. So I started to ignore her calls and texts, only then did the amount of harassment started to decrease.

At the same time, I started to analyze her behaviors and everything she said. I felt that she is not acting alone, there is someone behind her driving all this. But who is this person? By analyzing my electricity bills, I learned that starting around March 2021, Paris has not been living in my Bay Area home whenever I was not there. This explained why she was so opposed to me moving back to the Bay Area at the end of 2021, and in 2022 often told me to spend more time with our daughter in Sacramento. Where was she? It’s probably the same place she stayed when she “went to China”. By analyzing my phone bills, I also verified Paris indeed started contacting her current lawyer in 2019.

# The paramour

On 4/10/2023, I accidentally found a Chick-fil-A cup while cleaning my garage. The cup had Sharik’s name and phone number printed on it. Who is this person? After several months of investigation, I found that Paris has been living with Sharik since 2016.

Sharik came to the United States in summer 2015 for PhD in Virginia, studying GPU Architectures, and he just graduated in August 2023. However, he only lived in Virginia until 2019 and has lived in multiple states since. Paris has lived with Sharik majority of the time.

1. Paris lived with Sharik in Virginia from March 2016 to April 2018. This was the time that she said she was “close to graduation” and “lived in a friend’s living room”. Truth is, she was not even going to school during those times.
2. Paris lived with me in California from April 2018 to August 2019, but she was often away to “see her advisor” or “vacationing”. I am sure she was with Sharik all those times she was away.
3. Paris lived with Sharik near University D from August 2019 to January 2020. The apartment that my parents and I lived in when we went to the East Coast for our daughter’s birth was actually Sharik’s apartment.
4. In March 2020, after Paris sent our daughter to my parents’ house, she went to Longmont, Colorado to live with Sharik.
5. In late 2020 and early 2021, Paris and Sharik lived together in my Bay Area home.
6. In April 2021, Sharik purchased a condo in Fremont. They lived together in Fremont until Sharik sold the condo in November 2022.
7. After the divorce, Paris and Sharik lived in the same apartment complex in South Bay. After that, they lived together in several other addresses in the Bay Area.
8. In Sharik’s dissertation, submitted August 2023, he thanked his girlfriend Paris for her support and encouragement.

I was not surprised that Paris had been cheating, but I was shocked that the relationship goes back to 2016. Who is this Sharik? Their schools are hundreds of miles apart, how did they know each other? Why did they start cohabiting so quickly? Did they already know each other in China? I started investigating Sharik in China, and they indeed knew each other long before they came to the United States.

Sharik came from a prominent family, his father is a senior officer in the Chinese military. He and Paris were high school classmates in China. He attended one of the best universities in China for bachelor’s, and majored in Electronic Information Science and Technology. Then he went to a naval college for master’s, and studied Mine Detecting Sonar. After graduation, he worked in the Chinese Navy for a couple years, and then he worked for a tech company in Shanghai. So this explained why Paris “interned” in Shanghai in 2014 and 2015, and she never went to Shanghai again after Sharik came to the United States.

# Paris’s version of the story

After Paris knew that I found out about Sharik, she did tone down her demands. I talked to her several times in 2024 to negotiate a settlement, and Sharik obviously came up during the conversations. Her version of the story is below.

1. Paris said she had known Sharik since she was 11.
2. Paris admitted that Sharik was her boyfriend when they were in China, but they broke up in 2010. The reason was Paris was planning to come to the United States, but Sharik couldn’t come because he was in the military.
3. Paris admitted that she didn’t intern for Baidu in 2014 and 2015, rather she worked for her previous employer in Shanghai. She claimed she did not live with Sharik when she was in Shanghai.
4. Paris admitted she had been in contact with Sharik after he came to the United States. In fact, she picked him up from the airport and helped him to settle down.
5. Paris admitted she lived with Sharik in Virginia between 2016 and 2018. She said she no longer had financial aid in 2016, so she didn’t have money to lease an apartment. She feared that I would’ve asked her to move to California if she told me, and she won’t be able to complete her degree. Sharik offered “temporary shelter” so she moved in with him. They lived in the same room, but she claimed that nothing happened between them.
6. Paris denied she was with Sharik whenever she was away from California between April 2018 and August 2019. She said she really did go see her advisor.
7. Paris admitted the apartment she lived near University D in 2019 was Sharik’s apartment. She said she couldn’t lease an apartment because she had no income, so Sharik leased it for her. She said Sharik didn’t live there, he lived in his advisor’s lab during that time.
8. Paris admitted she lived with Sharik in Longmont in 2020. The reason was that she must finish her dissertation in 2020. Had she lived in California then I would’ve asked her to care for our daughter, and she wouldn’t have time to work on her dissertation.
9. Paris denied Sharik lived in my Bay Area home in late 2020 and early 2021.
10. Paris denied that she lived in Sharik’s Fremont home in 2021 and 2022. She said she went to Sharik’s home everyday but still returned to my home every evening. As for why she went to Sharik’s home everyday, she said that’s none of my business.
11. Paris admitted she lived in Sharik’s Fremont home when she “went to China”. She said she wanted to travel with friends, but was afraid that I won’t let her go, that’s why she lied about “going to China”.
12. Paris admitted that Sharik picked her up and took her to his home on 11/28/2022, the night of the divorce.
13. Paris denied that she is still with Sharik after the divorce. She even said she never liked Sharik, and made a bunch of disparaging remarks about him. As for why Sharik claimed that she is his girlfriend in his dissertation, she said she doesn't know and has no control in what Sharik thinks.
14. Paris said she wanted to divorce soon after we were married because she felt that marriage life didn’t suit her. She accused me of ""controlling her life”, and said she had no freedom when she’s with me, but Sharik let her do whatever she wanted. I asked if that’s true then why didn’t she file sooner, and she said she hadn’t graduated and couldn’t support herself, she needed to graduate and find a job before filing for divorce.

I am not going to comment on her story. You be the judge.

# Who are they?

During the investigation, it’s hard to not notice both Sharik and Paris are incredibly strange people, and a lot of what they do defies common sense. They don’t look like typical students or typical adulterers. I really can’t figure out who they are. Some of their abnormal behaviors are:

1. Both individuals took 8 years to complete their PhD, but both left school after just 4 years. I looked up all other PhD students studied under their advisors, about 20 of them, and not one person took more than 5 years to graduate. Why did these two take 8 years? Why did both leave school 4 years before they graduated?
2. Both individuals attended elite universities in China, and have PhD degrees. They are more than capable of making top wages in the United States, and they should know the basic moral principles. Why did they have to go through all these troubles to do something so despicable?
3. They have known each other for more than 20 years, they are way past the honeymoon phase. Why did they have to go out of the way to be together all the time? This seems far too complicated for just doing the deed.
4. Sharik seldom went to school when he was in Virginia. None of his colleagues from school knew anything about him, a few didn’t even know he existed. What was he doing in Virginia? He didn’t talk to his colleagues at all in school?
5. Sharik moved frequently after leaving school in 2019. Other than the Fremont condo that he owned for 1.5 years, he didn’t stay longer than half a year at any of his other addresses. Why is he always moving?
6. Sharik is in close contact with several individuals with special backgrounds, such as individuals that work in the defense industry. How did he know these people?
7. If Paris planned to be with Sharik all along, then why did she have a child with me? This is just cruel. Also Sharik doesn’t mind? 
8. Paris spent the majority of the pregnancy with Sharik near University D. She didn’t have a job at the time, but she was out “working” everyday, even on the day of the delivery. What were they doing next to University D?
9. Our daughter is now 5 years old, but Paris has never cared for her, she seldom even comes to see her. She abandoned the child when she was less than 2 months old just so she can be with Sharik in Colorado. What kind of mother can be this coldhearted?
10. Paris has a PhD in a STEM major, but she couldn’t find a job in Silicon Valley after multiple years of “job search”. The judge has placed a seek work order on her, which she just ignores. Why won’t she work?
11. Paris is always very busy. Prior to the divorce, she was always in her room “working” whenever she’s home, sometimes at 4am in the morning. But she never had a fulltime job. What was she really doing?
12. Paris called her parents almost every day, and often talked for hours. Who talks to their parents that much? Was she really talking to her parents?
13. In 2017 and 2018, Paris went to Stanford University almost every day that she was in California, supposedly to work on her dissertation at the library, and sometimes she wouldn't come home until midnight. Paris didn’t graduate until October 2020, she couldn’t be writing her dissertation in 2017 and 2018. What was she really doing at Stanford?
14. Paris said her previous employer in China still reached out to her from time to time for help on projects, because they couldn’t find anyone else that could do them. What kind of employer would seek help from an ex-employee that left 10 years ago? What exactly can she do that is so indispensable?

In addition, both individuals are extremely secretive, and investigating them was incredibly difficult. Their background reports contain nothing more than their address history. The address history for Paris is not even correct - her report showed that she has been living with me since 2014. But she didn’t live with me! Now I know why she has been using my address everywhere after we were married, and won’t let me mail anything to her. She was trying to hide her whereabouts! Paris also refused to answer the majority of our Discovery questions, and none of the questions pertaining to Sharik. She was sanctioned by the judge for this yet she still refused to answer. Why can’t she answer those questions?

Some more oddities:

1. Paris seldom used my home Wi-Fi. She said she prefers hotspot xfinitywifi, because our home internet was unstable. She also used this as an excuse to often “work at libraries and coffee shops”. It is true that my home internet was unstable, it disconnects for a few hours almost everyday. I had Comcast come over several times and they weren’t able to find anything wrong. Oddly, I have not had any internet issues after Paris left.
2. Paris unplugged all my electronic devices whenever I was not home. She said it was to prevent fire.
3. Paris has alerts set up on search engines, so she knows whenever someone searches for her name online.
4. Paris constantly reminded me to not go through her stuff in her room, even though I never did. She moved all her stuff out the same night that she wanted the divorce. What exactly was in her room that she didn't want me to see?
5. Paris would not tell me where she lives after the divorce. She also warned me multiple times to not investigate her. Exactly what is she afraid of?

I am certain that the two of them are doing something shady. This is way too excessive for just adultery. But what are they doing?

# Lies

I think I am a fairly intelligent person and I am usually pretty good at spotting scams. I am still surprised that I was fooled for this long.

First, I never thought there are people this immoral, especially someone with a PhD degree. I think I was a bit cautious in the first couple years of this marriage, but I really let the guard down after having the child. I never thought there are people that don’t even care about their own children.

Second, Paris is exceptionally good at lying. She doesn’t just make up stories when needed, which is how most people lie, but she brainwashed me by continuously feeding me misinformation, and made me have a completely false perception of her. The contrast was really shocking when she revealed her true self after the divorce. Some examples are: 

1. Paris would tell me from time to time that some male friends were pursuing her, or some strangers tried to hit on her, obviously she turned all of them down. She also told me stories of her previous relationships, and we gossiped about celebrity relationships and those of her friends. She always loathed at those people that were unfaithful, including her close friends. I always thought that she is someone that’s open, honest, and faithful. Well, let’s just say what she did was far worse than people that she despised.
2. Paris always says she was just “borrowing” whenever she asked me for money, and would pay me back as soon as she gets a job. She told me numerous times that she is an independent woman, and does not want me to support her. In fact she is even “ashamed” that she had to rely on me for medical coverage. She often told me that once she gets a job, she would pay a portion of our mortgage and family expenses. She said this as recently as 2 weeks before the divorce. I never really expected her to make too much financial contribution to the family, but I also never thought of her as a greedy person, and certainly didn’t think she would take advantage of me. Boy was I wrong.
3. During our marriage, I had to be very careful whenever I talked to Paris, because she cried – with tears – whenever I said something that might sound slightly critical. I have always thought she is thin-skinned and has strong self-esteem. After I found out about Sharik, I chewed her out in every one of our negotiations, yet she didn't bat an eye and continued to ask for money after I was done. The shamelessness is just astounding.
4. During our marriage, Paris pretended that she knew little about the United States, and she often made silly mistakes or forget things. She also asks some very childish questions, and acts cute. Just two days before the divorce, she was “begging” me to buy her bubble tea. This made me think she is just a simple and naive girl, and lowered my guards. But the fact is, she knows more about the United States than I do, and she has an excellent memory. Not to mention she is extremely calculated and deceptive.
5. Paris is extremely meticulous with her lies. For example, to make me believe she was living with a female friend between 2016 and 2018, she often told me gossip about this “roommate” of hers, such as where she grew up, schools she attended, her boyfriend, her looks and figures, places they hangout, and etc. I never suspected the legitimacy of this “roommate” after hearing all these details. Little did I know she was actually living with Sharik in Virginia during that time. I did some research on this “roommate”, she does exist, and most of what Paris said about her were true, except they were not roommates.

Most importantly, Paris is extremely tough mentally. When she lies, she always speaks with confidence, and doesn’t appear the least bit guilty. Even when her lies were exposed, she still can keep her composure and quickly make up another story to cover up the lie. This was especially obvious during our recent negotiations. I obviously don’t believe anything she says now, but I was fooled many times by her confidence and assertiveness during the marriage.

I do wonder if Paris’s lying skills are her natural abilities, or acquired via some training.

# Conclusion

This lawsuit lasted 2.5 years and it just ended about a month ago. Perhaps I will write another post at some point with more details on the whole process. The end result is I lost about one third of my wealth. That’s just direct loss, indirect loss is impossible to estimate. Most importantly is the psychological trauma I had to go through, and all the years that I wasted on her. My lawyer said this is considered a good outcome under current laws. Perhaps so, but how is this good? How can I not feel angry, frustrated and disheartened?

During this marriage, I have tried my best to be a good and supportive husband. To date, Paris still couldn’t state exactly how I mistreated her. She on the other hand was just exploiting me. Other than giving birth to our daughter, everything else she did was anti-family.

I don’t believe Paris ever intended to have a family with me. She even stated that she has wanted a divorce since 2016, and she started consulting divorce lawyers in 2019, shortly after getting her green card.

Paris was living with another man for the majority of this marriage, and lied to me on virtually everything. The lies I mentioned in this post were just a small fraction of the lies she told. This is a complete violation of the marital contract. Even during the times that she lived with me, she didn't do any housework or cared for the child. She was always busy “writing her dissertation” or “job searching”, which in hindsight were also lies, but I still don’t know what she was really doing. She didn’t fulfill any spousal obligations and had absolutely no contribution to the family.

Despite all these, the so-called California ""family” law worked in Paris’s favor in almost every aspect. In particular this so-called “no fault divorce”, basically doesn't matter what she did during the marriage, she is still entitled to my assets. What kind of logic is this? If everything is “no fault” then what’s the point of having laws? I understand it may be difficult to tell right and wrong in many family disputes, but that clearly isn’t the case here, and what she did couldn’t be more vile. The purpose of laws is to set social standards, protect public rights, and serve justice. Is infidelity, lying, and scamming the kind of values that our elected officials want to promote? The court that handled this case is called the Hall of Justice. Justice is to defend the good and punish the bad. Well, perhaps that’s too much to ask for, but at least don’t punish the good and reward the bad.

I have asked Paris multiple times during our negotiations why she thinks she deserves such a large portion of my assets. She couldn’t provide any good reasons, she just kept stating the law says she is entitled to my assets. Yeah, but this law is just utterly unfair and unreasonable. I suggest the the following changes be made:

1. If one of the spouses cohabitates with a person of the opposite sex without the other spouse’s knowledge, then the times of cohabitation should not count as a part of the marriage.
2. If one of the spouses had major concealments or malicious lies which hurt the interest of the other spouse, then the non-offending spouse should be able to request a shortening of the marriage duration or receive financial compensation.
3. If one of the spouses committed serious fouls during the marriage, then the non-offending spouse should not have to pay spousal support or legal fees to the offending spouse.

There are about a dozen more changes that I would like to see happen to the existing family law, but the three listed above target what I feel are the most egregious and nonsensical.

Part of the reason why I wrote this post is to vent – the past 2.5 years have been extremely difficult and depressing for me. More importantly, I hope what happened to me can get the attention of lawmakers so we can fix these loopholes. Governor Gavin Newsom, Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, Senate Leader Brian Jones, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Assembly Leader James Gallagher, and other lawmakers in California and elsewhere, I hope you can see this and do something about it.  I hope no one has to experience what I went through again.",10,1752866019.0,stories,9,0.92,False

I’m on the hunt for hidden gem towns in New Jersey—specifically downtowns that don’t get talked about enough, are underrated, or kind of forgotten when people mention the “popular” spots.

I’m looking for beautiful, walkable downtown areas with that wholesome, small-town vibe—think Gilmore Girls-style charm. Bonus points if the town has a real sense of community, with local festivals, holiday events, parades, or farmers markets. A place where you can grab coffee, stroll past little shops, and feel like you’re part of something cozy and connected.

What towns come to mind that deserve more love? Would love to hear your favorites that fly under the radar!

They finally met in person after she broke up with her ex. He flew out to see her as she lived in a different state in June of last year. She came out for a visit the following month and stayed with him. In August she visited again where they informed us that she was pregnant. I have met her once by this point. About a month later, she lost the baby. I was already just feeling super weird vibes from her, but the way she was handling the miscarriage rubbed me the wrong way. She just kind of brushed past it while Tom was grieving. I expressed my concerns to Cindy because she has been friends with Tom longer than anyone in our group, she told me to give her a chance. So I bit my tongue but stayed observant.

In November she moves to our state and brings all of her kids. Tom gets them a 3 bedroom trailer because it is the most that he can afford because she does not work, she homeschools all of the kids. She doesn’t really talk to anyone in the group all that much. I still have only actually seen her once. 

On New Year’s Eve, we are at Cindy mother’s house for a party, everyone is drinking and having fun. She asks me what myself and Ben do for work, as well as Cindy and Adam. We all work in education. Cindy is a theatre teacher, Adam works in special ed, Ben works in tech inventory for an online school, and I work for the enrollment department of that same online school. She started asking me about the online school and I let her know that if she was interested in the school, to let me know and I could help her get started. Cindy and I head out to the garage to get some more drinks and Tom and Summer announce in our group chat that they are now engaged. Ok wow that was kinda quick. But we are happy for them. I mean I have my opinions but I keep my mouth shut.

A few days after New Years Eve we had our annual Friendsmas party. It’s just us adults, we have White Elephant, we play drinking games, it's a really fun time. But not at all kid friendly. For example, I got an entire box of food themed sex toys and our out of state friend got a set of plush boobs. We played Gartic Phone and almost every drawing turned into dicks. It is not for kids. Summer asked Cindy if her youngest could come at the very least since he has never been away from her that long. He is 6 years old, remember? Cindy apologizes and says that this party is specifically no kids because of the content. She throws a huge fit and declares in the group chat that she hopes we all have fun without them because neither she nor Tom are coming to the party if the kids can’t come. BTW they do have a baby sitter, Tom’s parents and sisters have said that they are available whenever to watch the kids, she just never takes them up on that offer.

Then, in March, I found out from Cindy that I am apparently one of the BMs. The bride does not tell me, Cindy does. Ok cool. I get added into a group chat with a couple other people where we start vaguely discussing the wedding. They don’t have a date picked out yet, but we’re talking colors and stuff. She then reaches out to Cindy and I directly about working at her son’s birthday party. I am in a cosplay group with Ben, Adam and Cindy and one of the group cosplays we have is Spidey and Friends. Myself as Ghost, Ben as Spidey, and Adam as Spin. Cindy would be our handler to make sure the kids don’t get to rough or overwhelm anyone. We do Cons, parties, hospital visits, all of it. The party is set to happen in April.

We get to the party. It’s outdoor at a park and we are expected to be the sole entertainment for the entirety of the party. The party went long and turned into 4 hours of being in character. In the heat (we are in the deserts of SoCAL). With little to no intervention from the parents when their kids got a little rough or tired to pull on our suits. At one point, Summer’s 17 year old daughter was repeatedly hitting Ben and Adam on the arms after multiple attempts to get her to stop. Summer just scrolled on her phone and said nothing to her. We are nearing the end of the party, we sing happy birthday to the kid and take our leave. We go back to our car and get changed out of our suits and into street clothes to make our appearance at the party as ourselves rather than the heroes. We help clean everything up and start to get ready to leave when Tom stops us and pulls us aside. He asks if we can stop by their place to build this little car that they got for the birthday boy, because they ‘just couldn’t figure it out’. We begrudgingly agreed as the party went on way longer than they said it would and we all have work the next day and they live 2 hours away from us. We follow them to their house and they show us the box with the car that is still taped shut, so I’m a little peeved at this point. We spend about an hour putting it together and saying our goodbyes. 

We were not compensated at all for the party, nothing was even offered. If they offered, we probably would have declined anyway because that’s what friends do, but they didn’t even have any food at this party and offered nothing to us. We normally have a paid rate for these parties. For how long the party went, she would have paid around $500. WHATEVER.

When we were all cleaning up the party, Summer asked me what I was going to be wearing as a bridesmaid. I let her know that I was looking at a black dress because that was the color that she asked us to wear. She said it looked great and asked if we could add some red to the outfit. I ended up finding a red bow belt to wear with it and she approved and didn’t mention anything else. Remember that.

On the way home, Cindy and I were discussing things for the wedding when she spilled to me that Summer was expecting everyone to come out the night before the wedding for a dress rehearsal, set up the venue, and get a hotel to spend the night that way we would be there bright and early to help set up the reception before getting ready for this 11:30am wedding. THEN we would help tear everything down after the reception and possibly spend the night that night as well to ensure that everything was clean since where she booked everything gave no help at all in this. This was not asked of us, it was expected. She told us we were doing this. I broke the news that me and Ben would not be spending any nights out there as hotels are not cheap there since there are so few of them. Adam and Cindy agreed and we made the plan that we would drive out there together and split the cost of gas.

Our cosplay group got asked to be featured cosplayers at a local con the first weekend in May in the same city that Tom and Summer live in so we took this as an opportunity to not only hang with them, but some of our other friends who are also involved in this. We get to the event in cosplay and work it, then meet up with our friends after they let us go, they had another group coming for the second half. We meet up with Clarisse, Charlie, Wilson, Winter, David, Hannah, Wayne, Tom, Summer, and all the kids. Charlie and Wilson have 1 son, Winter and David have a son and a daughter. Then there are Summer's 4 kids. We had planned when we found out about this event that we would all go to dinner after the event together as adults, get some drinks and catch up, you know? We walk around the con, see the vendors, and buy some things. All while Summer’s son is constantly trying to hang off of Ben, who is dressed as Spider-Man. He’s asking politely for him to stop and he just ignores him, even hitting him a few times with a plastic sword so hard it broke in half. Summer said and did nothing except for when the sword broke, then she coddled him and glared at Ben. We all decide where we want to eat and because we are a larger party, I suggest calling ahead to make sure they can accommodate us and that we don’t inconvenience the staff too much. So I ask for a headcount and Summer says that they are 6. I stop and look at Charlie and Cindy. Because I swore that we all agreed that the dinner was going to be no kids. Wilson was going to take his and Charlie’s son so she could go and David was going to take his and Winter’s two kids so she could go. She says that she changed her mind and that she wanted the kids to go. So we end up with a pretty big table and I secure a reservation. But this means that Ben has to go buy different clothes. He was just planning on eating in his Spider-Man suit. But if the kids are there, he would have to take his mask off in front of them and that would kill the magic. And because he is an amazing person, he won’t do that. So Adam and Ben get him a shirt, shorts, and shoes from Walmart, Tom and Summer take her kids home to get ready for dinner, Winter decides not to go (I don’t blame her) and Clarisse, Charlie, Cindy and myself head over to the restaurant to get our table. The dinner is weird, Summer is super rude to the servers despite them not doing anything wrong and her kids are throwing fits constantly and are on their iPads with the volume on full blast the whole time. Bombastic side eye the whole time.

Fast forward to a week and a half before the wedding and Adam has been informed that not only is he a groomsman, he is also walking Summer down the aisle and giving her away. Ben has also been informed that he is a groomsman and that there is a very specific vest that Tom wants them both to wear, along with a black button up short or long sleeve underneath and black cargo shorts. Luckily, the vest was available on Amazon and would be here a day before the wedding. It is also at this time that Cindy and I are informed that we need something white in our outfits. Summer suggests white sandals that look like Baby's First Wedges from Payless Shoe Store. Oh btw, Winter got roped into being a bridesmaid as well. So we are all confused because we are wearing solid black 50’s style dresses with red bow belts and she wants us to wear white lace sandals? The ones she sent us were like $50 too, and we were all planning on wearing shoes that we already had. Summer says that whatever shoes are fine, she just wants some white on us. So we scramble and find some white flower crowns that don’t look too bad with the outfit.

Two days before the wedding, Summer messages me and asks what time Ben and I could get to their town on Friday (the day before the wedding). I let her know that we would be leaving our town at 5 since we get off of work at 4:30 and be there by 6:30/7PM. She lets me know that they are having a rehearsal dinner at 5:30 so we should get some food on the way up. That way when they’re done at the dinner, we can go to the ceremony site and practice before going to the reception to set up. I’m just wanting to get this all over so we say ok. 

Friday comes. We get off of work, our bag is packed, we load up the car and head out. We stop at a Taco Bell and shove tacos down our throats so we don’t waste too much time. We are almost to their city, it’s 6:30, and I get a text from Cindy.

Cindy: They just got here

Me: What the fuck?!! We could have made it for dinner. We got Taco Bell cause she said we were gonna miss the dinner!

Cindy: You so could have made it

Fifteen minutes later, we arrive.

We walk in and say hi to everyone and ask the game plan. Cindy and Adam let me know that they aren’t going to be able to stay for practice because Cindy’s little sister is graduating at 8pm that same night. Everyone finishes up their food and Adam and Cindy take off. We all head to the ceremony site. Ben and I are the last to arrive. We get there and Tom and Summer are huddled together looking at her phone together and everyone else is just kinda standing around. It is already 8:00pm at this point.

Tyler and Alex are there, who we meet for the first time and learn that she is also a bridesmaid. The night before the wedding. Ok cool. 
I ask them how we want to start rehearsals and what the song order is. I then learn that they are still figuring out what song the kids are walking down to. They also don’t know who is going to be using the phone to set the songs up and make sure they play at the correct time since there isn’t a DJ. They decide that Cindy’s little sister is going to do it, without really asking if that was ok, since Cindy was not there and neither was the little sister that they wanted doing this. The night before the WEDDING. OK cool.

After about 20 minutes and a divorce joke from Summer, they figure out the songs. We get the speaker turned on so we can practice walking and we notice that the fountain they want us to start walking at is so loud that we can’t hear the music. The speaker they had wouldn’t go any louder and was so fuzzy. Luckily, Ben brought his JBL speaker with him. We synced it up to Tom’s phone and practiced walking up and down three times over the course of 40 more minutes because no one could get her kids to walk down when they were supposed to or stand where they were supposed to. The youngest girl kept tattling DURING WALKDOWN on her brother to Summer, while the son kept trying to play in the fountain and run off. Her seventeen year old keeps trying to cling to Ben while he keeps literally pushing her off of him. It’s weird and uncomfortable. 

We hit 9pm and they say they think we are good and we can now head over to the reception hall to start decorating. I look at Ben and at Winter and back to Summer before apologizing but telling her firmly that we can’t stay any later. We are staying with my father who only lives an hour away instead of two hours but we still have to drive that hour home. And she wants us back in the morning at 9:30am to start getting ready. I let her know that we will be here early like she wants but we need to leave. Hannah says that she can’t stay either since she has to drive an hour to pick up Wayne and come back so that they are both there early in the morning to get ready. Winter mentions how she needs to get home too since she has to go to Walmart and Michaels the next morning to pick up the table clothes, decorations, and other things needed for the wedding BECAUSE THEY HAD NOTHING THE DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING OH MY GOD. This all throws Summer into a tailspin. She throws her hands up and goes ‘I guess it all falls on us then?!’ and storms off. I turn to Tom and let him know that I’ll keep him updated on our arrival time tomorrow. We leave. I message Cindy.

Me: Just now leaving the rehearsal

Cindy: Just NOW?

Me: Yep…

Cindy: Are you going to help decorate?

Me: We’re going home. They’re going to work in the reception hall. We’re gonna help with whatever they need tomorrow morning. I’m gonna come ready and help the boys. You missed the biggest shit show ever. 

Cindy: We just left the graduation but I’m not gonna tell them because I don’t want to be expected to go help.

Me: Bro same. Hannah isn’t going to go help cause she still has to go back to pick up Wayne.

Cindy: It’s just not reasonable for them to expect all these people who live hours away to stay late and help and still get here early tomorrow.

Me: She was pissed that Hannah, Winter and us two weren’t sticking around. She literally said “I guess it all falls on us then’

Cindy: Everybody is busy. You guys won’t get home until 10:30, Winter has two kids, Hannah has to get Wayne because he is literally in the wedding and Adam and I aren’t going to miss (Cindy LS)’s graduation over a girl we’ve known less than a year.

Me: FUCKING EXACTLY. I feel like I’m having a stroke. Also she is 1000000% pregnant.

Now this was something that I had been speculating about for awhile. I knew that they were trying so it was only a matter of time before something happened. But do you hate me for thinking that they shouldn’t? She already has 4 kids that she doesn’t really take care of. They live in a 3 bedroom trailer. Don’t bring another one into this. But I digress. Cindy and I confirm the plan for tomorrow. 

THE WEDDING DAY.
Ben and I woke up. Text a good morning to Adam and Cindy and start getting ready. Ben ran and got starbucks for us all, they arrive, we head out. We are set to get to the girls get ready spot at 9:20. We get there.

No one is there except for Winter. OK. 

Cindy and I talk with Winter about all that went on last night. We’re getting close to 10:00am and we have not heard anything or seen anyone. So we leave Cindy and her little sister with Winter and me and the boys head to the ceremony site to help set up. 

No one is there. ALRIGHT. OK THAT’S FINE.

We start making sure the chairs are straight and that the gazebo is cleared off. Tom finally arrives with a couple of grocery bags of decorations. We start laying out the red carpet they bought, discovering it only covers about a quarter of the walkway. Next we move onto the table where they are doing a nature ceremony to have the elements of nature tie them together forever. This was decided upon about a week before the wedding and Cindy was told that she is giving the speech for Summer’s side and Tyler was doing Tom’s. We set up the flower decorations on the table and do our best to make this look good for them. It is about 10:45am at this point, 45 minutes till the wedding start time.

I get a message from Cindy.

Cindy: Guess who’s still not here?

Me: You’re joking

Cindy: We’re supposed to start in 45 minutes and the bride hasn’t started getting ready

Me: What if she doesn’t show

At this point, I’m panicking. What is going on right now. I decide we are going to make this work the best we can. We continue to set up and make adjustments to the decorations. Tom realizes that they don’t have all of the decorations and calls Summer to see where the rest of them are. As far as I know, he didn’t find out. They end up talking on the phone for a bit. It is at this point that we learn that she is getting coffee. 

At 11:01 she gets to the house, fresh Starbucks in hand. She complains about the traffic to get from her house to the house they are getting ready at. KEEP IN MIND;  they live in a town where maybe like 5 people are driving around at any given time and they live MAYBE 3 minutes away. As soon as she gets there, she starts complaining about things that Tom did not take care of and seemingly doing anything to prevent her from starting to get ready. Her and her 4 kids still need to get ready and we are 15 minutes out till the start of this wedding. 

I gather Tom, Ben and Adam and let them know that we need to split up to cover the entrances. Even if the bride is late, the guests probably won’t be, and we need to make sure they know where to go. Ben covers one entrance, Adam and I cover the larger second one, and Tom stays right by the ceremony to make sure that people are greeted. I get a text from Cindy.

Cindy: She literally just said ‘everyone is late once’ about being late for the wedding

Me: I can’t. What’s your guys’ eta look like? (we are 5 minutes till the start of this wedding btw)

I don’t get a response and I’m HOPING it is because they are getting stuff done and hopefully will be on the way soon. I was wrong. Guests start arriving and at this point I ask Tom how many people they were expecting. The wedding was supposed to have started by now and there were like five guests. He lets me know that they were expecting 40 and that some of his family is running behind. The temperatures are already getting super close to 100F and there is no word as to when we are starting this wedding. Adam, Ben, and I continue to wait for people to show up for this wedding. While we are waiting, we notice that a birthday party is happening at the splash pad that is maybe 30 feet from the gazebo. Wouldn’t it just be wild if while the wedding is happening, they decide to sing Happy Birthday? At 11:51 I get a text from Cindy.

Cindy: Girl

Me: I’m over this. I’m so over this.

Cindy: I’m so mad

Me: What’s happening?

Cindy: She got here at 11 and then fucked around for 20 minutes before starting to get ready. Then finally started and wanted everything changed.

Me: Dude wtf is happening

I look into the ceremony area and notice that no one else has shown up. For the wedding that was supposed to start almost half an hour ago. Finally 2 more cars roll up, and it’s people here for the wedding! Yay! But why are they here so late? I message Cindy.

Me: Did she tell different people different start times? People are just now showing up and this shit was supposed to start 30 minutes ago.

I don’t get an answer but at this point I am miserable. It is well over 100F and there is no water or snacks or anything for us or the guests that showed. It is 12:15 now and Adam, Ben and I decide to walk to the Dutch Bros down the street so that we can get something to drink because we are all dehydrated. We’re waiting in like, at about 12:25, and I see Hannah’s and Winter’s cars pull up. We book it over so we can get this shit over and done with. 

Summer gets out of the car holding this big box of bouquets, long stem roses, and boutonnieres. We use the building close to the wedding site to cool off a second and get everyone situated. At one point, Summer looks me up and down and says ‘You look better than me’ with a pissed off look on her face. I tell her in no way is that true. I tell her that she looks gorgeous and I smile. She scoffs and wobbles away in her stilettos. There is confusion as to who is going to drop the long stem roses and where the flower girl’s petals are. More time passes with nothing being done, all us just twiddling our thumbs. Any time we think we are ready to go, Summer just ‘needs a minute’.

We are over an hour past when this wedding was supposed to start. The park manager has already asked us to wrap things up because they only rented the gazebo from 9:30-12:00 and it is now at 12:40pm. The manager is now kicking us out of the building we are in because we weren’t even supposed to be there in the first place. We finally get out there and I have everyone line up, the guests that are there are walking around the gazebo and seating area, mostly to find some shade. I made an announcement that we are starting soon and we would like everyone to take their seats. Lucky for everyone, Ben was able to show Cindy’s little sister how to do the music for the ceremony.

The wedding starts. Hannah and Wayne walk down to Heathens by Twenty One Pilots, and Wayne runs back because he is ALSO walking Winter down. Then Tom and his mother walk down to a traditional mother/son song. Then we go BACK to Heathens and Tyler and Alex walk down. Then Adam and Cindy. As soon as Adam gets Cindy to the stairs of the gazebo, he RUNS back to the building where Summer is hiding away for the big reveal. Next is Ben and I, then Winter and Wayne. The music switches to Can You Feel the Love Tonight and the three daughters walk down the aisle, dropping their flowers and petals along the way. The music changes again to My Girl by the Temptations and Summer’s son walks down with the rings. 

He gets 5 steps in before dropping the ring. Adam rushes out and helps fix the rings to the pillow and sends him back down the aisle. He makes it and we all pull him into the gazebo so he is at least out of the sun. Adam and Summer start walking down the aisle. Walk is a very loose term because she decided to wear these GIANT stilettos that she had NEVER worn before and was struggling to walk in now. It takes her a song and a half to get to the gazebo. This whole time, all of us in the wedding party are standing in the sun and sweating.

She gets up the stairs and they begin the ceremony. He looks so happy and she looks indifferent. In the middle of her talking, very faintly, we hear the birthday party start to sing. I struggle not to laugh. She is almost stumbling through her vows. They are doing the whole repeat after me thing and at one point, she grabs the binder with the papers in it from Hannah and reads directly from it because she couldn’t remember the three words at a time that Hannah was telling her. During this time, Alex goes to sit in the shade because she feels like she might pass out from the heat. I almost join her. They get to the candle ceremony and Cindy and Tyler go up and give a short speech about their respective person. Cindy’s was written by ChatGPT that morning on the way to the wedding. It was nice. The wind is fighting them so hard on getting these candles lit. They finally get them lit and realize that they don’t have anything to hold the melting candles so Tyler and Cindy just get to have hot wax pouring onto their hands. Tom and Summer join Tyler and Cindy and all four of them try to light the large center candle. The whole time they are trying to get the candle to take the flame, Summer is pissed and yelling at Tom under her breath about things that weren’t right and how he messed up her day. He’s just smiling along. They finally get the candle lit and share their kiss. It’s so awkward to witness because he is going full ham, leaning over to her and happy to the point of tears and she just kinda stands there and looks annoyed. 

They walk back down the aisle to the fountain and leave us all up at the gazebo since, you know, we didn’t practice or even go over that at all. We eventually follow them to the fountain and discuss how everyone is getting over to the reception. I decided to start working with Tom’s father to start getting everything cleaned up. Pretty much everyone but Tom and Summer start helping clean up and get the chairs taken away, Summer is sitting on the edge of the fountain on her phone and Tom is standing next to her while the kids run around. They announce that they are going to head to the reception while we clean everything up. Whatever at this point. We finish cleaning up, get our drinks from Dutch Bros and head over to the reception. They had rented out one of the offices at the back of the halls at the local fair grounds. It was a very cramped room for the sudden amount of people that came for the reception but not the ceremony.

On our way over, we are just possessing, the car, with Adam, Cindy, Cindy’s sister, Ben, and myself in it, is just silent. We’re all burnt from being in the sun for so long and chugging our drinks.

We get to the reception and discover two things.
It’s a dry wedding
There is no meal planned, only a charcuterie board and fruit and vegi tray.
OK COOL NO THATS FINE.

Everyone gets their small plate of things from the trays and their cup of no sugar added juice. Everyone is chatting. The kids are dancing and playing. Overall, not too bad. Until we get to the mother/son dance. They start it. It’s super cute. Then I notice Summer’s 10 year old on the floor, slowly butt scooting closer and closer to them, till she is right between them and the rest of the room. Then she stands up, and stares at everyone while they try to continue their dance. This has been a recurring thing with her, she just does everything she can to be the center of attention no matter what is going on. They cut their dance early and Tom and Summer go into their first dance, where this same situation happens. Then the son starts getting upset because Summer was away from him for .2 seconds. They cut their dance and Summer goes to sit down with her son and scroll on her phone while Tom addresses everyone there and thanks us all for coming. Tyler gives a speech. They cut the cake. They toast with sparkling apple juice. The whole thing starts to wrap up. Tom’s family starts to take off. 

That is when we learn that we as a wedding party can’t leave until the reception is cleaned up. Not just trash thrown out or minor stuff, I mean like the tables folded up in the corner of the room and the fridge cleaned out. So we spend the next HOUR cleaning up, taking out trash, putting decorations in boxes, making sure the kids don’t run outside of the building while Summer is on her phone. We finally get everything cleaned up and things loaded in their car. Next we have to pry Summer’s 17 year old off of Adam. She literally latches on and refuses to let go, it took 4 of us to get her off. Once again, Summer says nothing. We finally leave the reception at 4:45pm. 

Tired, burned, and frustrated, Adam, Cindy, Ben and I get drinks and Mexican food. We decided that we are going to unfortunately faze Tom and Summer out of our hangout sessions. 

We have kept up with this especially after learning that Summer’s kids don’t have all of their vaccinations. See my previous post on my page for screenshots on that mess.

Anyways, thank you for listening to my rant, I hope it’s been entertaining!

I have some nail polishes that look more metallic in the bottle than they are on my nails, and I want to fix this. I know that the metallic appearance is achieved with insanely fine-grade glitter, but I don't know that I can necessarily find that for purchase without shopping online, which I want to avoid for now. Is there a way to DIY making your glitter into a finer grit? I considered using a coffee grinder that I normally employ for spices, but I imagine that might produce shard-shaped grains and I will effectively be applying the nail polish equivalent of diatomaceous earth.

I remember when you took me on our first date, to multiple locations within the city. You wanted to show me around and brought me to some really cool places. Outside of the coffee shop, we were approached by a woman who asked for bus money. I don’t remember her circumstances, but I do remember you giving her all of your cash and wishing her well. 

I remember being so impressed with how giving and loving you were. I still admire these qualities about you. 

The problem is, though we couldn’t work out because of our individual circumstances; I have so much respect for you and I wish good things to come your way. I wish I could tell you that myself, but I hurt you while dealing with my personal struggles and lost the privilege of having any sort of relationship with you.

I’ve written multiple letters here, and things are more complicated than they may seem. I get people who message me and ask why we aren’t together if I feel such a way, and I think it’s more about compatibility, difference in upbringing, and personal growth for us. 

I wish I had a family that was as caring and loving to me as yours is with you. I struggled fitting into your family, heightening my struggles and feelings with my own family dynamics. The cultural differences didn’t help, either. (I’m just a dumb American with uneducated hillbilly trauma) I appreciate the culture you come from and I pray for your country often, as I’ve continued educating myself on the continuous struggle that your people have endured.

I wish you the best in all that you do, and I hope you know that the way you treated me was never the problem; It was the way I was struggling and knowing you couldn’t fix my problems for me, even though it’s in your nature to help.

1m3ayh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYTools/comments/1m3ayh3/uncover_the_maestri_house_mhmf03_milk_frother/,Uncover the Maestri House MHMF03 Milk Frother Review: Is It Worth Buying?,"The **Maestri House MHMF03 Rechargeable Milk Frother with Stepless Speed Control** initially caught my eye for its sleek design and promise of versatility. After using it every day for over a month (my mornings just aren't complete without coffee), I feel ready to share my comprehensive thoughts on this little gadget. This isn’t your average milk frother; it’s designed for those who appreciate precision and customization.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I immediately noticed the robust yet lightweight aluminum alloy body. It feels solid in your hand without being heavy, which is surprisingly rare in handheld frothers. There’s a stainless steel stand included that keeps it upright and organized, saving counter space and avoiding the dreaded frother rolling-around-on-the-counter situation. The stepless speed control dial is a game-changer—smooth to operate and intuitive. With such a design, mornings feel a tad more luxurious and fuss-free.

**Stepless Speed Control: A Useful Innovation**  
Fiddling with traditional milk frothers that only have on/off or preset speed options never felt satisfying. With this frother, I can fine-tune the speed from 4500RPM to 10000RPM with ease. Dial it up for thick, creamy froth perfect for cappuccinos, or keep it low for mildly emulsified drinks like matcha latte. It even manages to avoid the annoying splashes that cheaper frothers sometimes cause—thank goodness for that!

**Battery Life That Doesn’t Disappoint**  
Its built-in 2000mAh rechargeable battery lasts up to three months on a single charge. One word: convenient. I’ve been using it almost daily, and it hasn’t needed recharging yet. The USB-C charging functionality is a modern touch I appreciated—goodbye to swapping batteries every few weeks. Just plug it in, and in about three hours, it’s fully charged.

**Performance That Exceeds Expectations**  
The first time I used it, I timed how long it took to froth milk—10 seconds flat. Those fast RPMs really deliver the creamy, café-style texture I'd hoped for. Whether it's for a classic latte or frothed hot chocolate, this thing delivers every time. It even blends protein powder into drinks like a champ, which means fewer clumps and better-tasting shakes for me post-workout.

**Advantages**  
- Unique stepless speed control feature for precise frothing  
- Long-lasting rechargeable battery (up to 3 months per charge)  
- Lightweight and durable aluminum construction  
- Easy-to-clean detachable whisk design  
- Versatile enough for coffee, matcha, protein shakes, and more  

**Negatives**  
- Rotary dial feels slightly delicate for daily heavy adjustments  
- Cleaning the area where the whisk attaches could be easier  
- Whisking rods are smaller compared to other frothers, limiting the volume for larger drinks  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning is, thankfully, pretty quick. The detachable whisk design makes it easy to rinse under water. However, over time, the attachment area where the whisk locks in does need closer attention to prevent buildup. I chicken out sometimes and just wipe the body down with a damp cloth instead of using water. Knowing it’s waterproof gives some peace of mind, though, since occasional splashes are unavoidable.

**Competing Products**  
When compared with competitors like the Zulay Original Handheld Milk Frother or the PowerLix Handheld Milk Frother, this model shines for its custom speed control and portability. Others might offer similar battery life or whisking capabilities, but they often lack the adjustability that this product brings. However, the Zulay frother does come with a slightly more robust stand and storage, which kept it in contention. If price is a key factor, those might appear tempting, but they lack finesse in froth consistency that this one nails.

**Worth Every Penny**  
This frother sits slightly higher in price compared to ultra-basic models, yet the features and quality justify the cost. Features like the stepless speed control, aluminum body, and USB-C charging make it a long-term investment for any home-brew enthusiast. You’ll end up saving a bit on pricey café beverages while enjoying consistent results at home.

1m3axr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_musiclyyyy/comments/1m3axr3/boundless_beauty/,Boundless Beauty,"Ollie first met Piper in the kind of place where people pretended not to notice each other — a cramped campus café, all humming espresso machines and rain-streaked windows. She was already in his seat, pink-highlighted hair tied back in a messy knot, hunched over a sketchbook. He didn’t say anything, just stood there a second too long until she finally looked up.

“You’re blocking the light,” she said, not unkindly, and he found himself sitting across from her without even asking.

⸻

The second time was a week later, under the campus clocktower at midnight. He’d been walking home when a blur of laughter and movement nearly knocked him over — Piper, earbuds tangled, hoodie drenched from the drizzle.

“Twice in one week?” she said, catching her breath. “You following me, or am I just that unlucky?”

He smirked. “Could be both.”

She rolled her eyes, but she didn’t walk away.

⸻

Their collisions became routine. Study sessions that turned into arguments over playlists. Walks back to the dorms where they’d linger under flickering streetlamps, talking about nothing in particular. Ollie learned that Piper hated the rain but loved the smell of it, that she could never remember where she left her keys, and that she carried herself like someone who’d learned to outrun the world long ago.

⸻

One night, after a particularly brutal round of midterms, they ended up on the roof of her apartment building. The city stretched out below, every street awash in neon. Piper leaned against the railing, sipping from a convenience store can of coffee.

“You ever think about just… leaving?” she asked. “No plan, no map. Just getting on a train and not looking back?”

“All the time,” Ollie admitted.

She tilted her head toward him, the pink streak in her hair catching the neon glow. “So why don’t you?”

“Maybe I’m waiting for a reason to stay.”

⸻

Piper stared at him for a moment too long. The air between them tightened, charged, until she finally turned away with a half-smile. “You’re going to have to try harder than that.”

⸻

Weeks passed, but that night stayed lodged in Ollie’s head. He noticed the little things now — how Piper bit her lip when she was thinking, how she always sat on the floor instead of a chair, how her laughter could cut through even his worst days.

One rainy evening, they found themselves walking home under a single umbrella. Piper’s hand brushed his as they adjusted it, the warmth of her fingers sending an unwelcome spike of adrenaline through him. She caught the way his breath hitched, smirked, and didn’t move away.

⸻

It came to a head during another rooftop night. Piper was sketching, pencil flying across the page, when she said, without looking up:

“Do you like me, Ollie?”

He froze, his heart tripping over itself. “Why are you asking?”

“Because I can feel it. And because…” She finally met his eyes, something unreadable flickering there. “…I’m trying to decide if I want you to admit it.”

Ollie swallowed hard. The city noise faded, leaving only the sound of his own pulse. He took a step closer, close enough to see the freckles scattered across her nose.

“Then decide,” he said softly.

⸻

For a moment, he thought she might close the distance. But Piper only smirked, standing and slipping past him, her shoulder brushing his.

“Not tonight,” she murmured, her voice barely audible over the wind.

⸻

Ollie watched her go, jacketless and heartbeat thrumming, more certain than ever that she’d already made her decision — and that he was hopelessly, irrevocably in too deep.",1,1752865344.0,u_musiclyyyy,0,1.0,False

1m3au2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3au2j/the_thing_in_my_basement_is_getting_better_at/,The Thing In My Basement Is Getting Better At Mimicking Goku,"""*-Get ready, I'm about to hit you with not just my energy, but the energy of every good and pure creature in the universe! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH-""* My flat screen screamed at us. I was enjoying my morning cup of coffee while my son enjoyed his Saturday morning ritual. 

He was glued in front of the screen-so close I could actually see the price of his future prescription rise from across the room. He turned to me as Goku began to charge up this massive energy ball to throw at some white dinosaur looking thing. 

I think Spencer called it a ""Ghost Wave"" or something like that, I barely paid attention to the shows themselves, I was just happy he wanted me to watch with him. Anyway, he looked at me all doe eyed as he furiously threw his finger at the tv. 

""Dad-dad, do you think Goku's going to beat him?"" he asked with sincere panic running across his buck-toothed face. 

""I don't know Spence-the other fella is pretty strong."" I played along. Spencer turned his attention to the television as alien screeching and explosions rang out from it. 

""Nah Goku always wins. He's the strongest."" he proclaimed.

 I've been raising Spencer on my own for about three years now. My late wife, Maria, passed from an Illness when he was just six years old. The cancer was sudden, quick, and ruthless. At the funeral he was a stone, he sat in the back with an almost perplexed look on his face. 

Sympathetic relatives would try to comfort him, but he would just shrug and say she was sleeping and would wake up soon. Eventually it hit him of course, when he cornered me and asked why mommy hadn't come to read him his bedtime story that night. It was a rocky road, but eventually a sense of normality returned to our lives. The pain lingered in my heart-but Spencer got used to my fumbling of Jack and Jill and now couldn't sleep without it.

 Recently he had gotten into this thing called ""anime.""

 It started with a late-night dip into *Adult Swim* when he was supposed to be asleep.  I caught him watching this gruesome show with cannibal giants and sword wielding maniacs. I turned it off in a huff despite his protests and whines that it was ""the best thing ever made. Even the eventual nightmares about being eaten alive by forever grinning beasts didn't dissuade this assertion.

 I thought this phase would end as quickly as it began, but he began requesting other shows to watch-because ""The action was really cool."" I went online and asked around what would be ""Age appropriate"" to let him watch and was met with a swath of cartoons I'd never heard of. Eventually I introduced him to this ""Dragonball Z"" show and he's been hooked ever since. 

Personally, I think it's rather violent, but I suppose I can't complain when I myself used to beg my parents to let me watch Tom and Jerry. Then again Tom never kidnapped Jerry's kid then beat him under the guise of ""training."" 

But it's become our Saturday morning routine to watch a few episodes and then go help me with chores. I say help but really, he's just walking with me while I mow the grass recounting exactly what we just watched. It's a fun bonding experience none the less. 

That was until a week ago-before that thing appeared in the cellar. 

It began one late night when I was drifting off to sleep in the lazy boy. The TV was droning on in the background, casting a silver screen on my drowsy face. I was half a step into dreamland, that sort of sleepwalking delirium where you aren't sure if Harvey the rabbit is actually juggling chainsaws in front of you or you're about to have a very bizarre dream. 

""Hey."" A raspy voice whispered into my eardrum, startling me awake. My living room was empty-save the banal stream I had let *Tubi* run off on. I was alone in the dark-almost convinced I had imagined that creepy rasp.

""Hey-"" 

*knocknockknock* 

""-Let-me in."" A voice croaked from the kitchen. Goosebumps rode up my arm like a speedway as that soft knocking echoed through my mind. The I flipped the kitchen lights on-and was met with an unsettling silence. Nothing had been disturbed, there was zero sign anyone was in the house. I hadn't heard a door open, no creeping steps, no-

*knockknockknockknock*

It was coming from the basement door. The faded eggshell slab lied at the end of the dining room. Its faux gold handle was locked tight. Accompany that raspy voice and faint knock was a curious rattling as whatever lurked behind the door jiggled the knob. I approached the door, fist in the air like I was about to knock out whatever punk kid had snuck into my house. 

That's what I figured of course, it was some neighborhood kids being dumb and playing a joke. But there was something so unsettling about that voice to begin with. It sounded like had been devouring thirty packs of cigarettes a day, but there was a hint of familiarity to its tone. 

""Who are you?"" I whispered. 

""Hey-just let me in-it's me."" It prattled and knocked. It was-clearer now, like it had swallowed a lozenge. The voice was friendly, joyous even. It sounded so familiar though- I knew I had heard it before. But it sounded robotic-like an A.I regurgitating a poorly written script. 

""Get out of here before I call the cops."" I said. The rattling stopped and I thought the threat had worked.

*KNOCKKNOCKKNOCK* the thing pounded.

 I jumped back, embarrassed at myself for being so easily startled.

 ""Hey-there is no need for that. Just let me in. It's me."" It repeated. The knocks became more methodical now, a haunting taunt as it kept asking to be let in.

 ""Who are you-just get out of here already."" I threatened again.

""Come on-it's me Goku. Just let me in. Let me in James."" The thing calling itself Goku said. I backed up from the door, confusion swarming over me like a school of piranha.

""What the fuck."" I muttered. At this point, I thought I must have been having one of those lucid dreams. The knocking continued as I stumbled away, Goku's monotone pleading fading into the background. I tried to force myself ""to wake up."" but the lingering rattles and knocks pecked at me. 

I don't know when I finally knocked out but the blinding light of the morning sun assaulting me put me in a hell of a grogy mood. It was morning now and the only sounds were the birds chirping and Spencer humming to himself in the kitchen. I could hear him rummaging in the pantry-no doubt getting himself a ""small"" bowl of honey nut cheerios.

 I sighed in relief, thinking the strange visitor had been a dream after all. I pulled myself out of the lazy boy and went out to greet Spence. He was already knee deep in a gallon of milk and oats by the time I got to him.

 I salvaged what was left of the box for myself and the rest of the day was fairly uneventful. Near the evening, I stepped out to grab some takeout from around the corner. I was gone for maybe ten minutes-and I know; ""What sort of asshole leaves his nine-year old home alone?""

 But Spence is a well-behaved kid, he knows not to talk to strangers or play with the oven or anything like that. He knows better.

 He knew better.

 I came through the backdoor to find him sitting quietly at the dining room table. He smiled when he saw me, but his eyes kept flicking to the pale door to his back. 

""Thanks for the help lugging this in pal."" I said to him. He nodded his head and greedily reached for a grease-stained bag. I sat down beside him and dug into a quarter pounder myself. He was scarfing his kids meal down like there was no tomorrow-he was oddly quiet as well.

""Everything ok Spence?"" I asked him gently. He swallowed a chunk of meat and turned to me.

""Dad how come you didn't let Goku in?"" he said. I almost choked on my burger-the repressed dread from last night rushing in.

""You-you know he's not real, right bud?"" I treaded. He rolled his eyes at me.

""Well, I thought he wasn't, but he talked to me from the basement while you were gone."" he eagerly said. I looked past him, door quietly sitting there like a dark omen. My face flushed and I struggled to come up with a lie that would satisfy his curiosity without scaring him. 

""Well because-what if it wasn't Goku, remember a couple weeks ago that-purple horn guy swapped bodies with him?"" 

""Ginyu?"" he offered as I jumped on it.

""Yeah him-what if it was Gin-u? Plus, he's a stranger-and we don't talk to strangers, right?"" I urged. He looked to his plate and mumbled in agreement.  That's when a sharp knock on the door made us jump out of our skins and the voice called out to us both. 

""Hey- I'm not a stranger-I'm a Saiyan. You guys watch me all the time, I just want to meet my biggest fans."" Goku cried. His voice was so much better now, like I had kidnapped the voice actor and stuck him in my cellar. It was a damn near perfect imitation. 

Spence turned to me with wonder in his eyes and hurried to let his hero in. I scrambled to the door to stop him, nearly trampling him as I did. He whined in protest but I put my finger to my lips and ordered him to his room. He reluctantly stomped upstairs as the thing down there continued braying. 

It was then I called the cops- I didn't tell them a cartoon character was holed up down there of course, just that an intruder was there threating me and my son. Two patrolmen showed up smelling like donuts and overtime, and I showed them down to the basement. 

I could hear Spencer listening in from the base of the stairs as the cops thudded downstairs. A few minutes later they emerged and said there was no evidence of a break-in nor any intruders. They said worst case it was probably a raccoon that snuck into the walls and to call an exterminator.

 As soon as they left-the knocking resumed, Goku asking why I called the cops on Spencer's hero. I ignored the taunting creature and raced upstairs to find Spence sulking on the steps. I got on his level and tried to comfort him; I figured If I was freaked out, he must be horrified. Instead, he brushed off my hand and got in my face.

""Dad, I can't believe you embarrassed me in front of Goku."" he sniffled. 

""Son-whatever is down there I assure you it's not-"" 

""it's GOKU dad why would he lie!"" He screamed at me as he stormed off to his room. The sound of his door slamming shut smacked me like a club. I spent the rest of the night downstairs watching the basement door-making sure it stayed locked and secured. The thing was relentless. It would cycle in between angered pounding and repeating the same phrases over and over-

"" Come on it's me-let me in now.""

 "" I want to meet my biggest fans.""

 ""I heard you guys are pretty strong-want to train?"" Over and over as the night turned into day. In the morning Spence trudged past me without a word-backpack in hand as went to the bus stop. I offered to walk him, but he ignored me.

 ""Have a great day at school Spencer-maybe later we can train huh?"" Goku called out from the basement. Spencer stopped at the door and broke out in a wide smile. He waved at the door and called back to the creature.

 ""Bye Goku!"" He left without uttering a word to me. This went on for the next couple days- I would stand guard by the basement as the thing taunted me and tried to goad me into opening the door. A new sound joined the symphony of torment, a loaning scratch like nails being sharpened on a chalk board. I ran through options in my head. 

I could open the door while Spencer was safe at school and confront the thing-but I didn't even know what ""It"" was. For all I know Goku really was behind the door and I'd get my ass kicked by a cartoon. What if I opened it and it just disappeared again; like with the cops? That wasn't a comforting thought, it would me I was going insane. I could threaten it again, but it seemed more amused by than anything. 

""Hey James. If you let me in, I'll let you use a wish from the Dragonballs."" The thing offered. I rushed to the door and bashed on it in fury, my fists throbbing with anger.

 ""Just go away already, leave my family alone!"" I yelled at it.

""Hey James-you ever wonder if Spencer wished you had died instead of your wife?"" The thing asked. I recoiled away from the door like it struck me. 

""What did you-""

""I've heard this cancer guy is pretty strong-guess she wasn't tough enough to beat him though. Let me in-I'll take a crack at him."" The thing rambled angrily. There was that all too familiar eagerness to brawl in his voice-just like in the show. He was trying to get a rise out of me- and damn it-it was working. I slammed my arm on the door, and I heard something shuffle behind it. 

""Don't you talk about her-just leave us alone-why are you doing this to us?"" I begged of the thing. It laughed at me then, this choppy looped thing like a broken animation cycle. It was grotesque sounding, and I roared at the unseen horror as I slammed on the door once more in vain.

""HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HAHA, it's me Goku, why don't you just let me in. I need your help to defeat Frieza."" It just kept repeating itself like a broken record. 

""Shut up, shut up damn you-fucking monster. I hate you Goku!"" I screeched at it, clawing at the door like a raving loon. I was foaming at the mouth-demanding this thing leave my son alone and crawl back into whatever freakish pit it spawned out of.

""That's not very nice. I just want to train with you guys."" Goku said. 

""Fuck off and die you fucking cu-""

""Dad?"" A meek voice cut into my demented tirade. I wiped around to see my son standing in the doorway, eyes wide in fright at the sight of his mad father. I steadied my breath as Goku called out to Spencer, apologizing on my behalf. I rushed towards him to embrace him, reassure him that everything was ok. He flinched away from my grasp as guilt washed over me.

 ""Dad why are you talking to Goku like that? I thought you liked him too."" his voice quivered. 

""I-I do Spence but that thing isn't Goku, he's a cartoon-""

""It's anime dad."" He yelled and pushed me away. He ran to the basement door, Goku shaking it with vigorous anticipation. 

""Hey-let me in and we'll train. Just open the door. Open it right now."" Spencer reached towards the knob, my heart stopped when I heard the twisting click of the lock. The door stopped shaking. It was deadly quiet in the house now. Spencer was puzzled, the door slowly creaking in his hand. 

I was frozen in place-reality snapping back to me. Maybe, maybe it had all just been a hallucination hadn't slept all week, maybe-

*Thwunk*

The door flew open, knocking Spencer to his feet. The base of the stairs was pitch black, nothing but this otherworldly aura radiating out from it. It was this-fantastical burst of energy that was flying through the air. I could feel it electrifying the atoms around me, they buzzed and tingled with frenzied excitement. I've never felt anything like it-this surge of power. 

Yet the basement still hid this being in the shadows, all I could see was an inky void. Spencer stood up in spite of this raw power, an audible gasp escaping his lips. That's when a leathery hand stretched out from the void. 

It was pale, wilting like a corpse. A filthy, orange gi clung to its emancipated wrist. It reached out its hand, inviting Spencer to take it. He took it without hesitation, and I screamed for it to get away from my son. My voice sounded so distant and long in the dining room.

 I never saw Goku's face-but I could feel his smug smile as he whisked Spencer away down into the dark, the door slamming shut behind them. I broke out of my stupor-but by then it was too late. 

The police came of course-my soon has been missing for three days. I didn't report him because, well who would believe it? I tried to explain that to the cops, you can imagine how that went. 

There's sympathy of course, but mostly vile accusations and whispered looks all over town. As I write this, I have Dragonball Z on in the background.

 I like to think Spencer is still here, cheering on his frizzled hair hero instead of wherever that monster took him. Today that illusion was shattered however, as I passed the dank basement. 

I heard a quiet knock, like the clawed hand of a child. I heard my son's voice-monotone and soulless, and whatever was left of my sanity died as uttered this repeating phrase-

""Hey it's me, Spencer. Let me in I want to train."" ",8,1752865115.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

There it is. The alarm.
I slowly open my eyes, dreading yet another work day. With every passing day, my desire to climb out of bed wanes.
I look around my room. It’s boring. There is no art on the wall, no colors, just white. Everything is white, sterile, quiet and indifferent.

I roll to my left and fix my gaze firmly. On my little end table, I stare at the photograph. My wife and son smile back at me from inside the frame. I smile too. I can’t help it, even though they can’t see me.
God, I miss them.

I accepted this temporary job, stationed on this godforsaken rig, under the guise that the money would be good — and that the job would be, well, temporary. Unfortunately, it’s turned into a long-term deal, and it doesn't feel like a happy ending is possible.

As it does every morning, my body feels heavy as I push myself out of bed. I stumble to the shower. I haven’t yet, and probably never will, get used to this water pressure. The water slaps my skin like needles. It always does. I’ve stopped wondering if that’s normal. The least of my concerns, certainly.

Even mastering the art of pouring my morning cup of coffee eludes me. Depending on how the station tilts with its surroundings, this damn coffee just refuses to go straight into the mug.
“God, I miss Starbucks,” I mutter to myself.

I walk the corridor to work. I pass a few of my fellow crew members. We nod silently at each other. We don’t exchange smiles, like we used to. Like me, they’ve also found out that they’ll be here indefinitely.

“Hey Joseph, wait up.”
A voice echoes off the corridor walls from behind me. I turn around slowly and meet her eyes. It’s Marie.
“I wondered if we had the same shift today,” I say, my voice trailing off as she catches up.

“Why didn’t you stop and wait for me?” she asks. There’s desperation in her voice.

“I’m sorry, I just wasn’t sure if we had the same shift,” I mutter. Not nervously — weirdly. I’m definitely making it weird.

“So, can we talk about last night, Joseph?”

I knew that was coming. I was hoping it wouldn’t. I was praying that my vague, alcohol-infused memories weren’t real.

“Yeah, about that. Listen, Marie, I was feeling super vulnerable last night. Obviously, we’re both lonely up here. I’m just sorry if I’ve—”

“So, you regret it? Or you didn’t mean the things you said?”

“What? No! It’s not that at all. Things are just so… complicated right now.”
Of course things are complicated. This isn’t a Facebook status update. But I just keep making it worse. Pull it together, Joseph.

“Look, Joseph. We’re all confused. Let’s talk after work today? Do that for me, please?”

Marie walks away, but not without brushing her hand down my arm. Our fingers briefly want to interlock as she grazes them. I know I shouldn’t have, but I’ve developed feelings for her.
Is it possible to love two people at the same time?

I sit down at my desk and log in. My job is—no, was—as Mission Specialist Engineer. That title means less every day.
After the event occurred, some six months ago, we’ve all been scrambling to keep the station afloat. Given the circumstances, we’ve had to deviate from the station’s original purpose, slowly converting it into a long-term, self-sufficient, life-sustaining abode. My focus, specifically, is food preservation and new food growth.

Getting my Soil and Crop Sciences Ph.D. at Texas A&M hadn’t fully prepared me for this. This is something that couldn’t be studied. Every day, we’re learning something new. Cross-breeding crops has allowed us to grow multiple food sources while consolidating what little space we have here.

As I type away, the power flickers. This is not unusual, of course. After some of the damage during the event, we’ve had our solar panels reduced by half. We’re just lucky they all weren’t swept away.

A few hours pass. My eyes ache from staring at this screen. It’s hard to focus on my work with Marie permeating every thought. I feel guilty.

“I need a break,” I whisper to myself.

It’s been weeks since I’ve taken my break on the observatory deck — a place I used to visit daily before the event. I’d grab my favorite book, a cup of tea, and spend the entirety of my break there. I’d pause for long moments at a time and just stare at the vast peacefulness outside the observatory deck window. Our station was lucky to have the largest one ever built.

But now, the observatory deck just serves as a reminder — of what was lost.

Nonetheless, I grab my book and a cup of tea and make the walk to my favorite chair, thankful that it’s unoccupied.

I sit down and stare out. My eyes well up. They always do when I look.

No clouds.
No blue.
No movement.
Just debris.
Earth is gone.

Fragments drift like glass in the void.
One massive piece still burns.

The blast haunts me every day. We’re making it work up here, though.
Because we have to.

There are only a few hundred of us left. And it’s my job to help us grow more food — before we start repopulating.

I miss my friends and family.
I hope they felt no pain.

This was supposed to be a six-month contract. A job on the moon.

Now?
Now it’s all we have left.",1,1752865094.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1m3aqhh,https://i.redd.it/nhmuu7b8jodf1.jpeg,Comparing Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa to Khamrah:,"Having owned and enjoyed Khamrah, I was always curious to see what Khamrah Qahwa had to offer. Of course opinions are divided over which reigns supreme, so I’ll do my best to describe their differences as my experience was somewhat unexpected based on the reviews I’ve come across. 

Khamrah (to me) is all about the sticky dates, cinnamon, amber, and Akigalawood. Bergamot  brightens the fragrance. The dates provide a fruity, dense, and buttery quality akin to caramel to my nose. I do not perceive an “Apple pie” like quality from Khamrah. I find it to be sweet, but never too sweet thanks to the balance of notes and that Akigalawood which I love.

Khamrah Qahwa: unmistakably cut from the same cloth but with some minor tweaks that do set it apart. I sense a heavy dose of ginger combining with cinnamon that does remind me of an apple cider. In place of dates, “candied fruits” are listed and I feel this contributes to the apple cider effect (think candied apple). The coffee is combining with a nutty cardamom and praline that comes across mild and creamy. This is NOT a bold, dark roast aromatic coffee note. The coffee might not even be something I could pick out if the notes weren’t available to me. This version feels more spiced, less bright, and more gourmand. Something about Qahwa feels a bit more relaxed/ casual. It lacks the Akigalawood, which to me makes the presence less bold. So overall, a darker, nuttier, more gourmand, more festive take. More masculine? Not to my nose, but some may find that to be the case. I find both versions to be totally unisex.

I can’t yet fairly assess performance as this is my first test and the high heat is not a time I want to give this a full wear. I expect strong performance, but I suspect this one to be sitting closer to the skin than the original. At this moment in time, I do prefer the original but that could change when the weather cools and I can give Qahwa a proper wear test. I think both are fantastic offering from Lattafa and beloved for good reason. I don’t think you need both unless you enjoy collecting sets (guilty). To my nose, the difference is less about the coffee note, and comes down to caramel-like dates & Akigalawood with an amber quality found in Khamrah, vs cider spiced candied red apple with a creamy-nutty quality found in Qahwa. 

I’ve not tried Dukhan, but may eventually finish out the set. I would love to see a Khamrah flanker with the inclusion of an iris and leather, sub dried fruits/ dates with fig & coconut!",12,1752864881.0,fragranceclones,7,1.0,False

This is your room with Jane."" A woman's soft, teasing voice floated from the master bedroom of the suite next door. At this sound, Jane Ritter's eyes flew open, and she sat up abruptly. Her wedding to Colin Drake was tomorrow. She'd come to decorate their home despite her high fever, but she passed out soon later. She wondered, 'Am I hallucinating? I think I must have heard Lydia's voice... Why?' ""What if Jane finds out about us?"" The gentle voice broke the silence again, and Jane's heart sank. She couldn't have mistaken it—that was Lydia Ritter, her half-sister. She just didn't get what Lydia was doing with Colin in the next room. On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom. This was supposed to be her and Colin's space. She had come here today to prepare it for their wedding night, arranging a few personal touches to make it feel special. ""So what? You're so much better than that shameless Jane. What right does she have to question you?"" Colin's cold voice cut through the air. Jane's hand froze on the doorknob. She thought, 'Colin... it's really him inside? He actually thinks of me like that?' Lydia continued, ""Colin, I had no idea you felt that way about me. It's such a shame you're marrying Jane tomorrow. Poor you—Jane is so desperate. Everyone in Jovinia knows she threw herself at professors and judges last year just to win that award."" Colin sneered, ""Don't worry about it. The wedding is off. Jane isn't good enough to marry me. I've already told your father—I won't marry a woman like her. Tomorrow, Jane will just be a fool who got left at the altar."" Jane's spirits plummeted. Her eyes widened in disbelief as the words struck her like a punch to the gut. This was Colin, her boyfriend for years. He had always promised to trust her, to stand by her no matter what. But now, he was choosing to believe the rumors—that she had slept with professors and judges to win a jewelry design award. And now he even messed with Lydia in their bedroom. A wave of anger and hurt surged through Jane. She wanted to storm in and confront Colin, to demand answers. But as she took a step, her legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed. Her head spun, the fever making her feel weak and dizzy. But she couldn't let them see her like this. She forced herself to take a deep breath and stumbled out of the room. The elevator doors closed behind her with a gentle, polished swoosh, and suddenly, she felt her resolve crumble. She sank to the floor, tears slipping silently down her cheeks. After being framed and expelled from college, she had thought Colin was the only one who would still believe in her. But he had let her down. She didn't understand—if he didn't trust her, why had he given her hope in the first place? The elevator dinged softly. Jane was still sitting on the marble floor, her hair a mess, eyes red and tear-streaked. Only her slender lower leg, peeking out from under her skirt, looked untouched—smooth and perfectly shaped. ""Who are you?"" The voice was deep and cool, with a hint of impatience, drifting in from outside the elevator. Jane blinked, her mind foggy. She looked up and realized the elevator had reached the top floor. The doors were wide open, and there stood a tall man, wrapped in a dark robe. His hair was damp and tousled, and his eyes were cold and piercing. The robe gaped slightly, revealing a chiseled frame that made her heart skip a beat. His face was sharp and handsome, with an unusual flush to his cheeks. Jane took a deep breath. She remembered that this building, one of the most exclusive in the city, had only one apartment per floor. The higher the floor, the more prestigious the resident. Even Colin, with his wealthy background, could only afford a middle-floor unit. And the elevators required a card key to operate, and each key was programmed to access only the owner's specific floor. So this man had to be the penthouse owner. ""I—"" she started. But the man's brows twitched with irritation. His eyes flashed with anger. ""You didn't shower before you came,"" he said, more a statement than a question. Before Jane could even respond, the man's fingers were already gripping her chin. He studied her as if she were some object he was evaluating. ""Ouch... that hurts..."" Jane's voice was barely a whisper, soft and breathy. She was startled by how delicate she sounded, as if she were someone else entirely. But the soft sound seemed to please him. His grip eased just a little, and he tilted his head, taking in her flushed face. Her face, red from her cold, looked even more enticing without makeup, like a ripe, juicy peach. ""Just remember to take a shower next time. I like women who are clean,"" he said, his voice smooth and low. He bent down and lifted her into his arms. Her hands instinctively clutched at his robe as she let out a scream. ""Sir, I'm not—"" she started, confusion washing over her. Before she could finish, he silenced her with a hard kiss, pinching her chin again. Ignoring her protests, he carried her straight into the apartment. She realized in an instant—he'd mistaken her for someone else. He thought she was the kind of woman who came to him willingly. The door slammed shut behind her. Jane felt herself pushed against it by the man's firm grip. His cool, masculine scent, mingled with the raw energy, hit her all at once. This was her first kiss. She'd been with Colin for so long, and they'd never crossed this line. ""Sir, please—"" Her voice was cut short. The kiss was intense and forceful, and Jane, inexperienced, found herself unable to resist. Her legs felt weak, and she went limp, relying on his arms to hold her up. ""Remember, I don't like women talking too much at a time like this,"" he warned, gently but firmly slapping her hip. Jane trembled, her whole small body shaking. Jane looked up at him, her vision blurred by tears, but the dim light in the apartment made his face unclear. She smelled faintly of tuberose—something sweet, with a touch of mystery. He held her waist firmly and murmured in a deep, rough voice, ""I love your scent. So sweet... Stay still."" Jane went rigid, feeling his breath on her ear. She suddenly realized just how intense the man holding her was. His grip was unnaturally strong, and she couldn't break free. ""Sir... you don't seem right..."" she managed to whisper, her voice strained. Before she could finish, her last piece of clothing was ripped off violently, leaving her exposed. Chapter 2 One Year Later Suddenly, the man's eyes, tense with desire, flickered with a hint of suspicion. He frowned at Jane, wondering if she had been handpicked to get him out of this mess. ""You've never done this before?"" he murmured softly. Jane shook her head, her sobs turning into choked cries as she buried her face in his shoulder, biting down to stifle the pain. He gentled his hold on her waist, his expression softening. He pressed a soft kiss to her tear-streaked face, his voice soothing. ""Shh, it's okay. Remember, I'm your first. I'll take care of you. \*\*\*\*\* One year later, in Jovinia, the dim light of the Night Charm Club's private room cast long shadows. Don, a wealthy middle-aged man, his hair thinning and his belly straining against his shirt, leaned back with an air of self-importance. He said, ""Marry me, and I'll give you a thousand bucks a month. But I'm not paying for someone who can't pull their weight. You're young—twenty-two. Plenty of time to give me an heir. If it doesn't work out the first time, we'll just keep trying. "" He paused, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Jane. ""I know you've been with Colin, but I'm okay with that. As long as you're a good, obedient housewife, I won't mind your past."" Jane sat across from him, instinctively pulling back as his spittle flew with each word. She frowned, puzzled why her Lily had sent her to this club, to meet a man old enough to be her father. She wouldn't have come if it weren't for her mother's medical bills—a weapon Lily had used to manipulate her. ""So, sweetheart,"" Don said, his tone suddenly stern, ""got any questions about me? Or demands?"" Jane hadn't even been listening. She blinked and shook her head. ""No."" Don's stern expression softened into a patronizing smile. ""Figured as much. Marrying a guy like me is more than you deserve. A girl with a reputation like yours—who else would want you? Only someone like me would take you in. ""Come on, tell me. Besides Colin last year, who else have you been with? Spill it."" As he spoke, Don edged closer to Jane, his movements unnervingly suggestive, while she remained preoccupied. As Don mentioned last year, a tall, indistinct figure with vague features involuntarily surfaced in Jane's mind. A year ago, in that apartment, she'd caught Colin and Lydia cheating. But with a raging fever, she'd stumbled into the top-floor apartment and ended up with a guy she barely remembered. The next day, she left without even recalling his face clearly. When her family saw her coming home disheveled, the scandal erupted. Her reputation was ruined. Yet Colin had played the victim, jetting off abroad with Lydia to live it up carefree. ""Nothing to tell. Don, I'm leaving,"" Jane said, grabbing her bag and standing up. She was disgusted by Don's closeness. ""Hey, who said you could leave?"" Don grabbed Jane from behind and forced her back onto the sofa. His breath was hot and reeking. ""I paid a fortune for this whole floor. You're not going anywhere without my say-so."" ""Let me go!"" Jane twisted away, using her bag to shield herself. ""If you don't let me go, I'm calling the police."" She'd never imagined that agreeing to a blind date with her uncle and aunt would lead to meeting a man as repulsive as Don. ""Fine, call the cops,"" Don sneered. ""When they get here, they'll see how you're all over me. Your reputation in Jovinia is terrible—no one's gonna believe I spiked your drink."" ""What did you say?"" Jane's voice trembled. Don grinned wickedly. ""Heh, feeling hot? Want me to help you out?"" As Don's face blurred before her eyes, Jane felt herself burning. She realized her coffee must have been spiked. Seeing Jane's flushed face and glazed-over eyes, Don knew the drug was taking effect. He giggled, rubbing his hands together, and moved closer to her. Suddenly, the lights flickered and then went out completely. In the pitch black, a tall, imposing figure silently leaped in from the balcony outside the private room. ""Who are you? Who sent you—"" Don's voice was cut short as the stranger swiftly knocked him out with a precise hand chop, then dragged him into the restroom. Jane's mind was still racing, trying to make sense of what was happening, when she felt a large, cold hand clamp over her mouth. The air around him smelled of cold steel and something darker—blood. ""Don't make a sound if you want to stay safe,"" he growled. Jane's body tensed. The man reeked of danger, and the scent of blood was almost overpowering. Frantic footsteps approached the door. The man's eyes narrowed, and he pulled Jane closer, pressing her against him as he moved silently to the door. Her heart was pounding so hard she could barely think. She felt dizzy and feverish, but there was something oddly familiar about the man holding her—like a shadow from a year ago, a memory she couldn't quite place. Jane tried to pull away, but her body was weak from the drug. Instead, she found herself pressing closer to him, seeking some kind of refuge. ""Don, are you there? What's going on inside? Did anyone suspicious come by?"" a voice called from outside the door. The man pinched her waist, and a soft moan escaped her lips. The person outside, hearing the sound, assumed Don had succeeded. ""Damn it, he didn't come upstairs. Get more people down to search now. If he escapes tonight, we're all dead meat,"" someone shouted from outside. The chaotic footsteps finally faded into the distance. Jane's tension eased. She instinctively tried to pull away from the man's embrace, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she slumped back into his arms. ""Feels... so good..."" Her chin brushed against the man's broad, solid chest, and she let out a soft, instinctive murmur. The air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that was uniquely hers. ""'Is that you?'"" the man, Luke Drake, bent down to steady Jane as she nearly collapsed. Her familiar scent—sweet and mysterious, with a hint of tuberose—filled his senses. That night a year ago, as the haze of the drugs cleared, Jane had already vanished from the apartment. The drugs had scrambled his memory, and he couldn't recall her face at all. All he remembered was the faint, special scent on her, like the sweetness of tuberoses. After a year of searching for her high and low, he had unexpectedly run into her at this club today. And now, she was burning up and acting strangely. ""What are you doing here?"" He lifted her gently, his voice deep and rough with emotion. ""Me? I'm here...um... for a blind date."" Jane's voice was soft and drowsy as she tilted her head to the side. In the dim light, Luke's face seemed to blur into multiple images. She felt so hot and miserable, but his closeness felt so familiar and comforting. The mention of a blind date made Luke's brows furrow. He had been searching for her for a year, and here she was, on a blind date. Recalling what Don looked like, Luke narrowed his eyes coldly. He leaned down in the dark and kissed her, his voice rough. ""What a coincidence. You've saved me again."" He cupped her chin, his fingers firm yet gentle. Then he kissed her, a storm of passion—fierce, unyielding, and tinged with a dangerous kind of desire. Luke remembered that day, the day he'd promised to be there for her. But she had slipped away before the drugs faded. She'd made him break his word for the first time. Anyway, she had saved him back then. And now, here she was again, surprising him in the most unexpected way. There she was, nestled in his arms, her soft body instinctively pressing closer. She looked so innocent, so vulnerable. It was a sight that stirred something in Luke, something he'd never felt before. He was known for keeping his distance, for avoiding the complications that came with getting close to anyone. But with her, everything felt different. Jane was confused. She didn't know who Luke was or what he was talking about. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her body felt like it was on fire. Part of her wanted to run, to escape the intensity of the moment. But another part of her wanted to stay, to lean into him, to feel his warmth just a little bit longer. Before she could make up her mind, he bent down, lifting her effortlessly in his strong arms. The kiss deepened as he pressed her against the door, his body a solid, reassuring presence. His fingers found her chin again, holding her gaze. His kisses were demanding, each one more intense than the last, leaving her breathless and dazed. Jane felt her body go limp, her strength melting away. She responded instinctively, her reactions unfamiliar yet driven by a newfound desire. She surrendered to his dominant advances, feeling both vulnerable and alive. ""Please... no, we can't,"" she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible. ""We can do this. I'll take care of you, as I've promised,"" he murmured, his voice low and steady. Her resistance melted under the weight of his kisses, each one more insistent than the last. When a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm her, she bit down on his shoulder, hard. Time seemed to stand still as they remained entwined, each moment stretching into the next, like an eternity. \*\*\*\*\* It was three in the morning, and finally, it was over. Jane had fallen asleep, utterly exhausted. As the last traces of the drugs left her system, she nestled in Luke's arms, her face buried against his chest. The way she clung to him, so trusting and endearing, made Luke's eyes narrow in a satisfied, almost possessive way. A sliver of moonlight slipped through the window, landing on Jane's face, partially hidden by her dark hair. Then Luke realized he had never really seen her face clearly before. Gently, he lifted his hand from her waist and reached to brush the hair away from her cheek. Chapter 3 My Boss Wants To See You Suddenly, the phone jolted them both from the quiet. In the darkness, Luke frowned and pulled his hand back from Jane's face. He picked up the phone beside him. ""Hello."" It was Harvey, his assistant. Harvey said, ""Mr. Drake, we're glad you're safe. We've got your location. There's an emergency in Dorvania. The car's waiting downstairs."" Luke hung up and looked down at Jane, still fast asleep in his arms. He tried to lift her. But she murmured, ""Uh... I'm so tired. Stop."" Her hand pushed weakly against his, and she buried herself deeper into the blanket, too sleepy to even open her eyes. Seeing how exhausted she was, Luke slipped his obsidian ring onto her finger. ""Stay here and wait for me. Someone will come for you later."" \*\*\*\*\* A week later, at the Judd residence, the evening rain was pouring down in sheets. Jane pounded on the door, her fists thumping against the wood. The noise cut through the storm. She shouted, ""Johnson, Lily, open up! You promised that if I went on that date at Night Charm, you'd take care of Mom. So why did the hospital say you cut off her medical support—and even want to pull the plug? You can't just do this!"" The door finally creaked open. Her aunt Lily stood there, her face dripping with irritation. ""Jane, still showing up here for money? How shameless! ""Check the news. Ever since you met Don last Friday, he's pulled all his investments from our company. Now he's ghosting us, not picking up our calls. You must've ticked him off during that date. ""Don't think so high of yourself. You're just a nobody. Don was doing you a favor. Sleeping with him wouldn't have killed you, so stop pretending to be so high and mighty."" Jane's face drained of color. ""What? You told me to go on that date. You said you were worried about me being alone. You said I should marry a good man and make Mom feel better. ""But it was all a lie? Y-you never saw me as family. You just wanted to use me to get some investment for the company."" Then it hit her. It wasn't just a coincidence. Johnson and Lily had known all along that Don was after her. It was obvious he wanted her. No wonder Lily had spoken so highly of him—that creepy, disgusting old man who could have been her father. She kept replaying that night in her head. Don had spiked her coffee during the date. If she hadn't run into Luke, she'd never have made it out of there. And yet, here she was, back with Luke. The one who'd promised to be there for her, twice now. But he was gone again, just like before. All that remained was a black obsidian ring. She didn't even know what he looked like. It was only when she got home and saw herself in the mirror—love bites and kisses all over her skin—that she knew it hadn't been a dream. Jane yelled, ""Lily, how can you do this to me? You know your plan led me to some guy at that club? And he—"" ""Some guy? What guy?"" Lily's eyes narrowed, catching the slip. ""So you're a shameless tramp after all. Skipping out on Don to sleep with some random guy? No wonder Don hates us. ""We've done enough for you and your mom. Not a penny more for her medical bills. Get out of here, now!"" Lily turned and barked at Johnson, who was standing behind her, to throw out Jane's luggage. Seconds later, a black plastic bag filled with a few clothes was flung at Jane. Lily sneered, ""Get out of here before my Ella gets home and sees you. She'll be furious."" Jane's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for her mom Rose, lying in the hospital waiting for her to save her life, she would have fought Lily right there. Jane picked up the bag, her face darkening. ""No, something's missing. Where's the Larmes Sacrées Éternelles my mom gave me? Why isn't it in here?"" The perfume Larmes Sacrées Éternelles was her mom Rose's favorite scent. When Rose was still wealthy, she had bought it at an auction abroad; it was the last bottle in the world. Rose always loved it when Jane wore that scent, saying it suited Jane perfectly and brought back memories of Rose's own youth. Every time Jane visited Rose in the hospital, she would spray a little. The last time Jane used it was a week ago, before going to the club. Since then, she hadn't been back to the Judd residence, let alone use it again. ""What Larmes Sacrées Éternelles? I don't know what you're talking about."" A flicker of guilt crossed Lily's face. ""Forget it. I'll go look for it myself,"" Jane said. ""Over my dead body,"" Lily shouted and pushed Jane away. As they jostled, Lily caught a glint of something under Jane's collar. ""Hold on, you little sneak. What's that you've got around your neck?"" Lily's hand shot out like a flash, yanking the necklace right off Jane's neck and snapping it clean in two. A ring, studded with diamonds and set in obsidian, tumbled from the broken chain into Lily's grasp. She sneered, ""Whoa, look what we have here. You've been hiding quite the treasure, haven't you?"" ""No, give it back. It's mine,"" Jane cried. That ring was the only clue she had left from Luke. It was her lifeline to finding him.",1,1752864749.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

This has been further illustrated by the email from “Pat”. We assume many of you have received this nefarious attempt to undermine our initiative for a more open democratic process. They have gone to the extreme, resorting to the 1950 style, Joe McCarthy red-baiting and claiming we are all from other cities. A sad display of desperation. The Tempe City Council voted 7-0 on July 1st to approve the Tempe parks, events and activities ordinance. This was done without community input.  The change is substantial!The new system encompasses the entire park system, public buildings, and even private property throughout the city. The process was rushed. It appears that the decision was made behind closed doors.What’s the problem with the new ordinance?•   It is loaded with mind-numbing legal jargon, a confusing layout, with a matrix of codes and ordinances past and present.•   It involves many city departments. It is unnecessarily bureaucratic.  It is very likely unconstitutional.•   The special event permit application process requires an inordinate amount of time.•   The final authority to grant the permit rests with the unelected city manager.•   It restricts activities and gives the city manager personal discretion to opaquely deny applicants. Immediately after the vote, a coalition of Tempe organizations and concerned citizens launched a signature gathering effort to put the matter on the ballot.We need your help.

I still think it was some type of food poisoning but I had no nausea or diarrhea. Just terrible pain in my gut.

Woke up, made coffee. Made a bowl of that instant oatmeal blueberry flavor and finished my coffee and got ready for work. Very normal morning.

7am go out to my van (i work in the trades, painting) and my belly is starting to kinda feel uncomfortable. I sit for a minute deciding if it's because I need to go to the bathroom again. I decide no, it's weird but it'll be aright I need to get to the job.

The discomfort quickly escalates to pain, by the time I get to work I'm trying to hold it together and tough it out. I work an hour and just have to go home it's not getting better.

Back at the house all I could do is kneel on one knee and clinch my stomach riding out waves of pretty intense pain. Thought about calling a damn ambulance at one point. Like did I eat some glass unknowingly? I knew I couldn't take it for much longer.

But yeah no nausea whatsoever. I was actively trying to vomit thinking it's food poisoning and I just need to puke but couldn't get anything to come up. 

The whole ordeal ended about 11:30, so 4.5 hours. Never experienced anything close. I've had food poisoning and don't recall it being particularly painful, just super nauseated - vomiting every 5 minutes, some hot/cold sweats, explosive diarrhea.

1m3agdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m3agdq/i_thought_i_got_my_husband_back_i_was_wrong/,I Thought I Got My Husband Back. I Was Wrong.,"They found his boot first. Caked in red mud and half-sunken in moss, it looked like something the forest had spit out. The search and rescue team brought it to me in a clear plastic bag, like a piece of crime scene evidence. I remember staring at it for a long time, numb.

“It could’ve been an animal,” one of them said gently. “We’ll keep looking.”

They never found the rest of him.

Two weeks passed. I mourned him like he was dead. Screamed into the woods, smashed plates, tried to picture life after Colin. Our dog, Bishop, stopped eating. He would just sit and stare at the tree line, growling. One night, I woke up to find him pacing the bedroom, whining like he was trying to warn me. Or maybe... warn me that something was already here.

Then Colin came out of the forest. I was in the kitchen, pouring cold coffee, when Bishop lost it. Growling. Hair on end. The kind of growl that comes from something ancient and buried deep.

I ran outside and there he was. My husband. Standing at the forest’s edge. Thin. Caked in mud. Smiling.

He didn’t say a word. I ran to him. Hugged him. He was freezing. Silent. That smile never left his face, not even when I cried into his shoulder and begged him to tell me what happened. Not even when Bishop lunged at him and I had to drag the dog away, kicking and snarling.

We didn’t call the police. I couldn’t lose him again. I know it sounds insane, but pain makes miracles feel like reason. He didn’t speak at all that first day. Just smiled. Watched. Showered. Slept. Stared.

I made him steak for dinner, his favorite. He sniffed it, turned pale, gagged. Asked for berries instead. Only red berries. His voice was flat. Like he’d learned to talk by copying a recording. I gave them to him. He devoured them.

That night, I woke to a click. The lamp. I turned and saw him. Squatting at the foot of the bed. Not sitting. Squatting. Perfectly balanced. His spine arched like a spider, hands pressed into the mattress. I started researching. Missing hikers. Forest folklore. Skinwalkers. Fae. Possession. Doppelgängers. Nothing fit. Nothing explained why the birds had gone silent around our house. Or why the lights flickered whenever he walked by.

Then I found the notebook. It was hidden in his hiking backpack. Soaked. Mud-stained. Warped and swollen but still readable. The notes stopped abruptly two weeks ago. The day he vanished. The last few pages were… different.

**Day 6**

I found something. Or it found me. A clearing full of bones. Arranged in spirals. No birds. No insects. I felt watched. Left quickly.

**Day 7**

Whispers. Can’t sleep. Something’s following me. Not footsteps — shapes. Shadows in the trees. Eyes in the bark.

**Day 8**

I saw it. God help me. It was me. Another me. Smiling. No eyes. Just holes. I ran.

**Day 9**

It won’t let me leave. It knows me. It speaks with my voice. Says things only I should know.

**Day 10**

It offered me a trade. 

And then, scrawled sideways in frantic handwriting at the very bottom of the last page: I’m sorry, Emily. I didn’t want to die. 

My blood turned to ice. That night, I confronted him. Or… it.

“Where’s my husband?” I asked.

He blinked.

“I’m right here,” he said, looking confused. “Don’t you love me?”

“You’re not him.”

He smiled wider than any human should be able to. Lips stretching too far, revealing too many teeth.

“You’re right,” he whispered. “But I remember everything about him. And about you. I wear him well, don’t I?”

I ran.

I locked myself in the guest room and cried into Bishop’s fur. Outside the door, I heard him pacing the hallway. Whispering. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes growling low, animal-like.

At dawn, silence. He was gone. I should’ve left then. But I was stuck, chained to the house by fear… and a sick kind of hope. What if there was a way to bring Colin back? What if there was a ritual? A reversal? Something?

The next night, I heard singing. From the forest. Not words—tones. Notes that vibrated in my bones. Bishop crawled under the bed and stayed there, trembling.

I opened the window just a crack and I saw them. Shapes. Not just Colin. Others. Pale. Tall. Smiling. Dancing between the trees. Twisting. Imitating. And I recognized them. My high school boyfriend. My dead sister. My mother.

But none of them were real. And then I saw him. Or what had once been Colin. He saw me too. Tilted his head. And waved.

I slammed the window shut.

In the morning, I drove into town. Found a woman who ran an herb shop—ancient as dust, part Mi’kmaq. I told her everything. She didn’t even blink.

“You didn’t bury his clothes, did you?”

“…What?”

“They took his name. His skin. You left the door open, dear. You fed it.”

“I didn’t know…”

“They never just take someone,” she said. “They offer a choice. The forest doesn’t waste. It recycles. And it’s always hungry.”

“Can I stop it? Bring him back?”

“No. But you can starve it.”

That night, I left the door open again. Candles. Salt. Meat. His favorite song playing softly on the radio. A trail leading from the forest to our bedroom. A trap but backwards.

He mocked it. I crouched again at the edge of the bed.

“Do you forgive me?” he asked.

I nodded. Slowly. My hand slipped beneath the sheets, wrapping around the iron rod hidden there.

“I missed you,” he whispered.

I waited. Let him move closer. Let him whisper about how my skin still “smelled the same.” Let him reach out with those pale, stretching fingers.

Then I struck. The rod drove through his shoulder. He screamed—a sound not made for human lungs—raw, animal, unholy. And then his face… opened. Not torn. Split like something inside was trying to claw its way out of Colin’s mask.

I ran as fast as I could. Locked the bedroom. Hid in the attic. He howled. The whole house shook. Then came silence.

He’s still here. Some nights, I hear him just outside the attic door. Other nights, he dances with the others in the forest. Once, I saw Bishop watching too. Tail tucked tight, eyes wide, trembling.

Colin’s body is decomposing. But he isn’t. He’s still thin. Still pale. Still smiling. And he still remembers everything. Even now, when I cry, I hear him whispering through the vents:

“Don’t you love me anymore?”

I sleep during the day. Eat very little. Bishop never leaves my side. The forest has started creeping closer. Vines curling up the porch, moss spreading across the windows. They want me to open the door again. But I won’t.

I’ve learned something lives in those woods. Something worse than death. And sometimes…it wears the face of the person you love most.",3,1752864236.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

It's probably a combination of factors, right? They feature a lot of influencer content, so I'm guessing seeing those visually appealing recipes is a big driver. like, everyone suddenly making that whipped coffee last year likely trickled down from platforms other than KitchenAsStudio, but its curated recipe format probably amplified it among their users.

It's also engaging how quickly ""healthy"" trends seem to take off there. Maybe because the platform emphasizes visual presentation, healthier foods can look super appealing and sophisticated? I've seen things like elaborate smoothie bowls and avocado toast variations just explode in popularity for a while.Do you think the community’s algorithm also plays a part in promoting these viral recipes, even if they aren't necessarily the most practical for everyday cooking?

What other things might be unique to KitchenAsStudio that make certain food trends catch on faster than others?

1m3abuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1m3abuf/i_stood_my_ground_against_my_coworker/,I stood my ground against my coworker!,"most of my coworkers are great. annoying and difficult at times, but I get along with everyone. well, not everyone. there‘s one coworker I can‘t stand but he‘s a can of worms I don‘t want to open right now. and there‘s „Bob“

Bob is in his early 20s, has been doing this job since he was 15 or 16 (15 is the legal working age in my country), and when I started out as apprentice he‘d just finished his own apprenticeship. we‘re quite different to one another, but we get along well enough.

the thing is, he is lazy. he‘s good at what he‘s doing, but during slow days, he prefers nurturing his intimate relationship with his chair in the office and looking at his phone over doing whatever else work we don‘t get to do on busy days. he gets mad at our boss when he tells him to do something, procrastinates and oftentimes ends up passing this task on to me.

now I get preferring to do anything else, and the procrastination hits hard, but what really pisses me off is that Bob *always* makes me do tasks he doesn‘t like simply because I‘m the apprentice and he can. he doesn‘t uphold his end of the bargain though. he rarely teaches me anything and if our boss makes him, he goes over all the steps way too quickly to follow and gets irritated when it‘s my turn to try and I forget a step or take a little longer to complete the task. on occasions where I could put this training into practice, he sticks with those things because those are what he likes doing and doesn‘t even give me a chance to improve.

I‘m a doormat, but I‘m done taking his shit. he‘s ordering me around just because he thinks he can and I won‘t be treated like that yet again.

a couple of days ago, another coworker, „Ron“ and I spent the morning servicing equipment at a branch site. working with Ron always is a blast, but getting covered in *so much dust* was exhausting. right when we returned to our headquarters, Bob immediately told me to help him do x. he was pissed, presumably because our Boss told him to finally get this done after speding all morning doing nothing. I just wanted to have a cup of coffee first, but I was like „yeah ok I‘m gonna smoke a cig first“. when I returned, Bob and Ron were trying to fix some issue and Ron asked me to man the control panel. which is usually Bob‘s job.

a while later, when we finally got to do task x, Bob again got irritated because he was stuck doing what usually is the apprentice‘s task. he made the mistake of asking me to switch places. nope. I refused.

I refused to do as he wants for the first time! I‘m a big time doormat and it‘s a huge win in my books to stand up to someone!

Bob of course got even more salty. he‘s been a bit extra salty for a while because I‘m talking back to him occasionally. I talk back to everyone every once in a while and it‘s all in good nature. Bob doesn‘t take it well though. I think he can‘t handle that someone lower in hierarchy than him. well, surprise. this isn‘t the military. I‘m a grown adult (I‘m 6 years older than him btw) and I will be treated as such.

I‘m damn proud for standing up for myself.",5,1752863940.0,AutisticAdults,1,1.0,False

1m3aagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m3aagr/taming_the_billionaires_obsession_on_shaky_legs/,"Taming The Billionaire's Obsession_ On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom.","Taming The Billionaire's Obsession – A Dark Romance Worth Your Time (Full Novel on Noveloasis)"" Chapter 1 First Night

""Colin, stop... please. This is your room with Jane."" A woman's soft, teasing voice floated from the master bedroom of the suite next door.

At this sound, Jane Ritter's eyes flew open, and she sat up abruptly. Her wedding to Colin Drake was tomorrow. She'd come to decorate their home despite her high fever, but she passed out soon later.

She wondered, 'Am I hallucinating? I think I must have heard Lydia's voice... Why?'

""What if Jane finds out about us?"" The gentle voice broke the silence again, and Jane's heart sank. She couldn't have mistaken it—that was Lydia Ritter, her half-sister. She just didn't get what Lydia was doing with Colin in the next room.

On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom.

This was supposed to be her and Colin's space. She had come here today to prepare it for their wedding night, arranging a few personal touches to make it feel special.

""So what? You're so much better than that shameless Jane. What right does she have to question you?"" Colin's cold voice cut through the air.

Jane's hand froze on the doorknob. She thought, 'Colin... it's really him inside? He actually thinks of me like that?'

Lydia continued, ""Colin, I had no idea you felt that way about me. It's such a shame you're marrying Jane tomorrow. Poor you—Jane is so desperate. Everyone in Jovinia knows she threw herself at professors and judges last year just to win that award.""

Colin sneered, ""Don't worry about it. The wedding is off. Jane isn't good enough to marry me. I've already told your father—I won't marry a woman like her. Tomorrow, Jane will just be a fool who got left at the altar.""

Jane's spirits plummeted. Her eyes widened in disbelief as the words struck her like a punch to the gut. This was Colin, her boyfriend for years. He had always promised to trust her, to stand by her no matter what.

But now, he was choosing to believe the rumors—that she had slept with professors and judges to win a jewelry design award. And now he even messed with Lydia in their bedroom.

A wave of anger and hurt surged through Jane. She wanted to storm in and confront Colin, to demand answers.

But as she took a step, her legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed. Her head spun, the fever making her feel weak and dizzy.

But she couldn't let them see her like this. She forced herself to take a deep breath and stumbled out of the room.

The elevator doors closed behind her with a gentle, polished swoosh, and suddenly, she felt her resolve crumble. She sank to the floor, tears slipping silently down her cheeks.

After being framed and expelled from college, she had thought Colin was the only one who would still believe in her. But he had let her down. She didn't understand—if he didn't trust her, why had he given her hope in the first place?

The elevator dinged softly. Jane was still sitting on the marble floor, her hair a mess, eyes red and tear-streaked. Only her slender lower leg, peeking out from under her skirt, looked untouched—smooth and perfectly shaped.

""Who are you?"" The voice was deep and cool, with a hint of impatience, drifting in from outside the elevator.

Jane blinked, her mind foggy. She looked up and realized the elevator had reached the top floor. The doors were wide open, and there stood a tall man, wrapped in a dark robe.

His hair was damp and tousled, and his eyes were cold and piercing. The robe gaped slightly, revealing a chiseled frame that made her heart skip a beat. His face was sharp and handsome, with an unusual flush to his cheeks.

Jane took a deep breath. She remembered that this building, one of the most exclusive in the city, had only one apartment per floor. The higher the floor, the more prestigious the resident. Even Colin, with his wealthy background, could only afford a middle-floor unit.

And the elevators required a card key to operate, and each key was programmed to access only the owner's specific floor. So this man had to be the penthouse owner.

""I—"" she started.

But the man's brows twitched with irritation. His eyes flashed with anger. ""You didn't shower before you came,"" he said, more a statement than a question.

Before Jane could even respond, the man's fingers were already gripping her chin. He studied her as if she were some object he was evaluating.

""Ouch... that hurts..."" Jane's voice was barely a whisper, soft and breathy. She was startled by how delicate she sounded, as if she were someone else entirely.

But the soft sound seemed to please him. His grip eased just a little, and he tilted his head, taking in her flushed face. Her face, red from her cold, looked even more enticing without makeup, like a ripe, juicy peach.

""Just remember to take a shower next time. I like women who are clean,"" he said, his voice smooth and low. He bent down and lifted her into his arms.

Her hands instinctively clutched at his robe as she let out a scream. ""Sir, I'm not—"" she started, confusion washing over her.

Before she could finish, he silenced her with a hard kiss, pinching her chin again. Ignoring her protests, he carried her straight into the apartment.

She realized in an instant—he'd mistaken her for someone else. He thought she was the kind of woman who came to him willingly.

The door slammed shut behind her. Jane felt herself pushed against it by the man's firm grip. His cool, masculine scent, mingled with the raw energy, hit her all at once.

This was her first kiss. She'd been with Colin for so long, and they'd never crossed this line.

""Sir, please—"" Her voice was cut short.

The kiss was intense and forceful, and Jane, inexperienced, found herself unable to resist. Her legs felt weak, and she went limp, relying on his arms to hold her up.

""Remember, I don't like women talking too much at a time like this,"" he warned, gently but firmly slapping her hip.

Jane trembled, her whole small body shaking.

Jane looked up at him, her vision blurred by tears, but the dim light in the apartment made his face unclear.

She smelled faintly of tuberose—something sweet, with a touch of mystery. He held her waist firmly and murmured in a deep, rough voice, ""I love your scent. So sweet... Stay still.""

Jane went rigid, feeling his breath on her ear. She suddenly realized just how intense the man holding her was. His grip was unnaturally strong, and she couldn't break free. ""Sir... you don't seem right..."" she managed to whisper, her voice strained.

Before she could finish, her last piece of clothing was ripped off violently, leaving her exposed.

# Chapter 2 One Year Later

Suddenly, the man's eyes, tense with desire, flickered with a hint of suspicion. He frowned at Jane, wondering if she had been handpicked to get him out of this mess. ""You've never done this before?"" he murmured softly.

Jane shook her head, her sobs turning into choked cries as she buried her face in his shoulder, biting down to stifle the pain.

He gentled his hold on her waist, his expression softening. He pressed a soft kiss to her tear-streaked face, his voice soothing. ""Shh, it's okay. Remember, I'm your first. I'll take care of you.

\*\*\*\*\*

One year later, in Jovinia, the dim light of the Night Charm Club's private room cast long shadows. Don, a wealthy middle-aged man, his hair thinning and his belly straining against his shirt, leaned back with an air of self-importance.

He said, ""Marry me, and I'll give you a thousand bucks a month. But I'm not paying for someone who can't pull their weight. You're young—twenty-two. Plenty of time to give me an heir. If it doesn't work out the first time, we'll just keep trying. ""

He paused, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Jane. ""I know you've been with Colin, but I'm okay with that. As long as you're a good, obedient housewife, I won't mind your past.""

Jane sat across from him, instinctively pulling back as his spittle flew with each word. She frowned, puzzled why her Lily had sent her to this club, to meet a man old enough to be her father.

She wouldn't have come if it weren't for her mother's medical bills—a weapon Lily had used to manipulate her.

""So, sweetheart,"" Don said, his tone suddenly stern, ""got any questions about me? Or demands?""

Jane hadn't even been listening. She blinked and shook her head. ""No.""

Don's stern expression softened into a patronizing smile. ""Figured as much. Marrying a guy like me is more than you deserve. A girl with a reputation like yours—who else would want you? Only someone like me would take you in.

""Come on, tell me. Besides Colin last year, who else have you been with? Spill it."" As he spoke, Don edged closer to Jane, his movements unnervingly suggestive, while she remained preoccupied.

As Don mentioned last year, a tall, indistinct figure with vague features involuntarily surfaced in Jane's mind.

A year ago, in that apartment, she'd caught Colin and Lydia cheating. But with a raging fever, she'd stumbled into the top-floor apartment and ended up with a guy she barely remembered. The next day, she left without even recalling his face clearly.

When her family saw her coming home disheveled, the scandal erupted. Her reputation was ruined. Yet Colin had played the victim, jetting off abroad with Lydia to live it up carefree.

""Nothing to tell. Don, I'm leaving,"" Jane said, grabbing her bag and standing up. She was disgusted by Don's closeness.

""Hey, who said you could leave?"" Don grabbed Jane from behind and forced her back onto the sofa. His breath was hot and reeking. ""I paid a fortune for this whole floor. You're not going anywhere without my say-so.""

""Let me go!"" Jane twisted away, using her bag to shield herself. ""If you don't let me go, I'm calling the police.""

She'd never imagined that agreeing to a blind date with her uncle and aunt would lead to meeting a man as repulsive as Don.

""Fine, call the cops,"" Don sneered. ""When they get here, they'll see how you're all over me. Your reputation in Jovinia is terrible—no one's gonna believe I spiked your drink.""

""What did you say?"" Jane's voice trembled.

Don grinned wickedly. ""Heh, feeling hot? Want me to help you out?""

As Don's face blurred before her eyes, Jane felt herself burning. She realized her coffee must have been spiked.

Seeing Jane's flushed face and glazed-over eyes, Don knew the drug was taking effect. He giggled, rubbing his hands together, and moved closer to her.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and then went out completely. In the pitch black, a tall, imposing figure silently leaped in from the balcony outside the private room.

""Who are you? Who sent you—"" Don's voice was cut short as the stranger swiftly knocked him out with a precise hand chop, then dragged him into the restroom.

Jane's mind was still racing, trying to make sense of what was happening, when she felt a large, cold hand clamp over her mouth. The air around him smelled of cold steel and something darker—blood. ""Don't make a sound if you want to stay safe,"" he growled.

Jane's body tensed. The man reeked of danger, and the scent of blood was almost overpowering.

Frantic footsteps approached the door. The man's eyes narrowed, and he pulled Jane closer, pressing her against him as he moved silently to the door.

Her heart was pounding so hard she could barely think. She felt dizzy and feverish, but there was something oddly familiar about the man holding her—like a shadow from a year ago, a memory she couldn't quite place.

Jane tried to pull away, but her body was weak from the drug. Instead, she found herself pressing closer to him, seeking some kind of refuge.

""Don, are you there? What's going on inside? Did anyone suspicious come by?"" a voice called from outside the door.

The man pinched her waist, and a soft moan escaped her lips.

The person outside, hearing the sound, assumed Don had succeeded.

""Damn it, he didn't come upstairs. Get more people down to search now. If he escapes tonight, we're all dead meat,"" someone shouted from outside.

The chaotic footsteps finally faded into the distance. Jane's tension eased. She instinctively tried to pull away from the man's embrace, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she slumped back into his arms.

""Feels... so good..."" Her chin brushed against the man's broad, solid chest, and she let out a soft, instinctive murmur. The air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that was uniquely hers.

""'Is that you?'"" the man, Luke Drake, bent down to steady Jane as she nearly collapsed. Her familiar scent—sweet and mysterious, with a hint of tuberose—filled his senses.

That night a year ago, as the haze of the drugs cleared, Jane had already vanished from the apartment. The drugs had scrambled his memory, and he couldn't recall her face at all. All he remembered was the faint, special scent on her, like the sweetness of tuberoses.

After a year of searching for her high and low, he had unexpectedly run into her at this club today. And now, she was burning up and acting strangely.

""What are you doing here?"" He lifted her gently, his voice deep and rough with emotion.

""Me? I'm here...um... for a blind date."" Jane's voice was soft and drowsy as she tilted her head to the side.

In the dim light, Luke's face seemed to blur into multiple images. She felt so hot and miserable, but his closeness felt so familiar and comforting.

The mention of a blind date made Luke's brows furrow. He had been searching for her for a year, and here she was, on a blind date.

Recalling what Don looked like, Luke narrowed his eyes coldly. He leaned down in the dark and kissed her, his voice rough. ""What a coincidence. You've saved me again.""

He cupped her chin, his fingers firm yet gentle. Then he kissed her, a storm of passion—fierce, unyielding, and tinged with a dangerous kind of desire.

Luke remembered that day, the day he'd promised to be there for her. But she had slipped away before the drugs faded. She'd made him break his word for the first time.

Anyway, she had saved him back then. And now, here she was again, surprising him in the most unexpected way.

There she was, nestled in his arms, her soft body instinctively pressing closer. She looked so innocent, so vulnerable. It was a sight that stirred something in Luke, something he'd never felt before.

He was known for keeping his distance, for avoiding the complications that came with getting close to anyone. But with her, everything felt different.

Jane was confused. She didn't know who Luke was or what he was talking about. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her body felt like it was on fire.

Part of her wanted to run, to escape the intensity of the moment. But another part of her wanted to stay, to lean into him, to feel his warmth just a little bit longer.

Before she could make up her mind, he bent down, lifting her effortlessly in his strong arms. The kiss deepened as he pressed her against the door, his body a solid, reassuring presence.

His fingers found her chin again, holding her gaze. His kisses were demanding, each one more intense than the last, leaving her breathless and dazed.

Jane felt her body go limp, her strength melting away. She responded instinctively, her reactions unfamiliar yet driven by a newfound desire. She surrendered to his dominant advances, feeling both vulnerable and alive.

""Please... no, we can't,"" she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible.

""We can do this. I'll take care of you, as I've promised,"" he murmured, his voice low and steady.

Her resistance melted under the weight of his kisses, each one more insistent than the last. When a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm her, she bit down on his shoulder, hard.

Time seemed to stand still as they remained entwined, each moment stretching into the next, like an eternity.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was three in the morning, and finally, it was over. Jane had fallen asleep, utterly exhausted. As the last traces of the drugs left her system, she nestled in Luke's arms, her face buried against his chest.

The way she clung to him, so trusting and endearing, made Luke's eyes narrow in a satisfied, almost possessive way.

A sliver of moonlight slipped through the window, landing on Jane's face, partially hidden by her dark hair. Then Luke realized he had never really seen her face clearly before.

Gently, he lifted his hand from her waist and reached to brush the hair away from her cheek.

# Chapter 3 My Boss Wants To See You

Suddenly, the phone jolted them both from the quiet. In the darkness, Luke frowned and pulled his hand back from Jane's face. He picked up the phone beside him. ""Hello.""

It was Harvey, his assistant. Harvey said, ""Mr. Drake, we're glad you're safe. We've got your location. There's an emergency in Dorvania. The car's waiting downstairs.""

Luke hung up and looked down at Jane, still fast asleep in his arms. He tried to lift her.

But she murmured, ""Uh... I'm so tired. Stop."" Her hand pushed weakly against his, and she buried herself deeper into the blanket, too sleepy to even open her eyes.

Seeing how exhausted she was, Luke slipped his obsidian ring onto her finger. ""Stay here and wait for me. Someone will come for you later.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, at the Judd residence, the evening rain was pouring down in sheets. Jane pounded on the door, her fists thumping against the wood. The noise cut through the storm.

She shouted, ""Johnson, Lily, open up! You promised that if I went on that date at Night Charm, you'd take care of Mom. So why did the hospital say you cut off her medical support—and even want to pull the plug? You can't just do this!""

The door finally creaked open. Her aunt Lily stood there, her face dripping with irritation. ""Jane, still showing up here for money? How shameless!

""Check the news. Ever since you met Don last Friday, he's pulled all his investments from our company. Now he's ghosting us, not picking up our calls. You must've ticked him off during that date.

""Don't think so high of yourself. You're just a nobody. Don was doing you a favor. Sleeping with him wouldn't have killed you, so stop pretending to be so high and mighty.""

Jane's face drained of color. ""What? You told me to go on that date. You said you were worried about me being alone. You said I should marry a good man and make Mom feel better.

""But it was all a lie? Y-you never saw me as family. You just wanted to use me to get some investment for the company.""

Then it hit her. It wasn't just a coincidence. Johnson and Lily had known all along that Don was after her. It was obvious he wanted her. No wonder Lily had spoken so highly of him—that creepy, disgusting old man who could have been her father.

She kept replaying that night in her head. Don had spiked her coffee during the date. If she hadn't run into Luke, she'd never have made it out of there.

And yet, here she was, back with Luke. The one who'd promised to be there for her, twice now. But he was gone again, just like before. All that remained was a black obsidian ring. She didn't even know what he looked like.

It was only when she got home and saw herself in the mirror—love bites and kisses all over her skin—that she knew it hadn't been a dream.

Jane yelled, ""Lily, how can you do this to me? You know your plan led me to some guy at that club? And he—""

""Some guy? What guy?"" Lily's eyes narrowed, catching the slip. ""So you're a shameless tramp after all. Skipping out on Don to sleep with some random guy? No wonder Don hates us.

""We've done enough for you and your mom. Not a penny more for her medical bills. Get out of here, now!""

Lily turned and barked at Johnson, who was standing behind her, to throw out Jane's luggage.

Seconds later, a black plastic bag filled with a few clothes was flung at Jane. Lily sneered, ""Get out of here before my Ella gets home and sees you. She'll be furious.""

Jane's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for her mom Rose, lying in the hospital waiting for her to save her life, she would have fought Lily right there.

Jane picked up the bag, her face darkening. ""No, something's missing. Where's the Larmes Sacrées Éternelles my mom gave me? Why isn't it in here?""

The perfume Larmes Sacrées Éternelles was her mom Rose's favorite scent. When Rose was still wealthy, she had bought it at an auction abroad; it was the last bottle in the world.

Rose always loved it when Jane wore that scent, saying it suited Jane perfectly and brought back memories of Rose's own youth. Every time Jane visited Rose in the hospital, she would spray a little.

The last time Jane used it was a week ago, before going to the club. Since then, she hadn't been back to the Judd residence, let alone use it again.

""What Larmes Sacrées Éternelles? I don't know what you're talking about."" A flicker of guilt crossed Lily's face.

""Forget it. I'll go look for it myself,"" Jane said.

""Over my dead body,"" Lily shouted and pushed Jane away.

As they jostled, Lily caught a glint of something under Jane's collar. ""Hold on, you little sneak. What's that you've got around your neck?""

Lily's hand shot out like a flash, yanking the necklace right off Jane's neck and snapping it clean in two. A ring, studded with diamonds and set in obsidian, tumbled from the broken chain into Lily's grasp.

She sneered, ""Whoa, look what we have here. You've been hiding quite the treasure, haven't you?""

""No, give it back. It's mine,"" Jane cried. That ring was the only clue she had left from Luke. It was her lifeline to finding him.

""Get out of here. You and your mom owe us more than you'll ever repay. This ring is the payment. Try to take it, and you'll regret it."" Lily slapped Jane hard across the face, again and again, before shoving her out the door.

The iron gate slammed shut with a resounding bang, leaving Jane in the pouring rain. Neighbors peeked out their windows, snickering at her swollen face, at the girl who'd been kicked out like trash.

For a moment, Jane felt like she was drowning in despair. The man she'd thought would stand by her had vanished. The family she'd trusted had turned their backs on her. And her mom was still waiting for her help. She didn't know what she could do.

Then, out of nowhere, headlights blazed behind her. A sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her. A man stepped out. ""Ms. Jane Ritter? Our boss wants to see you.""

# Chapter 4 Get Married

Half an hour later, Jane was escorted to the penthouse of a luxury office tower in downtown.

It had been years since she'd been in such a high-end place. After her parents divorced, she and her mother had been kicked out of their home and had to rely on others for shelter.

Downstairs, she'd seen people dressed in sharp business suits, their faces cold and distant. It reminded her of Luke she'd encountered earlier, though his coldness had been sharper, more chilling.

Jane's thoughts drifted back to that night at the club a week ago. She remembered Luke, who had pressed her against the door. Her hands twisted nervously in her lap. She still had no idea who he was.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over her, blocking out the light. She looked up to see a pair of cold, piercing eyes.

Luke, the man standing before her, had sharp, chiseled features and an air of quiet menace. He was tall and broad-shouldered, and just his presence made her feel small and uneasy.

Jane's heart began to race. She felt an odd mix of fear and a strange sense of familiarity with Luke. It was as if she'd seen him somewhere before. But then, she wouldn't have forgotten someone like him.

""Ahem."" she began, straightening her posture. ""Sir, well, you want to see me?""

Jane looked at him earnestly. One cheek was still swollen from the earlier humiliation, but her eyes were clear and bright. In a way, she was grateful to him for pulling her out of that embarrassing situation with her neighbors.

Luke seemed surprised that she'd spoken first. His cold eyes narrowed just a bit, and his gaze lingered on her bruised face for a moment longer than necessary.

Then he spoke, his voice deep and smooth, but edged with a hint of menace, ""So, Ms. Ritter, are we pretending not to know each other now?""

Jane's heart skipped a beat. She didn't understand why he was saying this. She didn't remember a thing about him. She said, ""I think you have the wrong person, sir. I don't know you at all.""

He looked down at her, his cool eyes fixed on her puzzled face.",1,1752863851.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Here's a bit about my process.

I did my middle-aged checkup after feeling fat. I made a goal for myself to hit sub 10% body fat for my 39th birthday. This is the 3rd time I've been this lean; the other times were in college at 21, and then again at 30. Weight didn't change much, started at 162 and today was 163. I've always ""trained"" and worked out, but have a bad habit of fuck-around-itis in the gym. My main issue has always been diets, mainly sweets. So decided to attack with focus and a plan.

Edit: Start 5' 7"" 163# , 38 male, 18% bf ; End 5'7"" 163#, 39 Male 9.7% bf

Training:  Did bro split workout 6 days a week, with active rest, cardio stretching day 1 day a week. Tried to get 9k steps every day, maybe got about 2/3 of the time. Total workouts were 1-1.5 hrs daily, 8-12 exercises and about 24-30 sets on average. Included supersetting (often compounds with iso movements or abs). Hit multiple PRs in deadlift, squat, bench, ez bar curls, tricep cable press, leg press, and barbell rows.

DIET

Macros: Maintenance was est 2400 kcal. The target was about 2k a day. Protein at 160 grams a day. The rest with fat and carbs. Didn't really track those, just aimed to make sure total calories were not exceeded. First, about a month before this, I cut sugar, then 2 weeks prior alcohol, so I started the diet process a bit before, might have been at 20% BF, but never did the scan.

The program started, and I went to eating clean and meal-prepping prepping. Chicken, beef, sweet potatoes, rice, yogurt, eggs, broccoli, alvcado, lettuce, beans, bananas, strawberries, yogurt, protein shakes and bars, nuts, protein pasta, cottage cheese, shredded cheese, coffee creamer. All drinks were sugar-free (Gatorade Zero, flavored water, tea with Splenda, coffee with Splenda, Monster Zero) Note, there were a couple of times in here I indulged, as I am a BBQ addict. Had brisket, chicken wings, pulled pork in here (4th of July, vacation, and my bday all occurred during this cut.

I got a sweet tooth really bad about 3 weeks in, which happened to be while on vacation, and I made keto treats. Keto protein fudge, keto cookie dough balls, and Keto Cheesecake. I would snack on these when cravings hit. I hardly ever ate out, maybe twice the whole time. Would drink socially, 2 drinks max, maybe 3 times over the whole 2 months. So I had a few days to indulge. But actually, I felt full most of the time, and it wasn't too bad.

I also started creatine during this and did a creatine load about 2 weeks in taking 20 g for a week. Then went down to 5gr daily. 1 scoop of Gold Standard whey protein after every workout.

1m3a50h,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1m3a50h/the_silent_king_full_summary_and_lore_notes_full/,The Silent King: full summary and lore notes (full spoilers),"I saw some discussion on the book already, but I wanted to give a full summary and lore notes, so here we go. Obviously, full spoilers ahead.

- The book starts with Magos Perscrutor Camalin Hiax 43-Tau-Omicron trying to look a necron tomb. I believe he made a brief appearance in the first Dawn of Fire book. Apparently he was a little *too* interested in necron technology, including integrating pieces of it into his own body, and so was marked for punishment. This punishment basically involves being sent to loot more necron tombs
- The Imperium initially designated the necrons as 19342q8756/Kappa, an unknown and vanished alien species.
- The expedition to this tomb world fails, and a massive necron fleet arrives and drops pylons on it. Hiax was already leaving at this time, after the Archmagos Dominus messed things up, and so manages to escape after taking a video of the pylon deployment process, thinking he's the first to have done so.
- The World Bearers attacks in Segmentum Solar have failed and have petered out, but they're still scattered around the segmentum and causing a general nuisance.
- Oud Oudia Raskian is confirmed dead. Or at least the Ad Mech thinks he is. (I don't know if this is news or not, honestly I haven't read the Carrion Throne series yet.) The implication seems to be that they know he's dead and how he died though. In any case, a new Fabricator General has been selected, but he's unnamed.
- We kind of knew it already I think but it's been revealed that the Ad Mech has been rapaciously looting necron tomb worlds, with the implication that this has actually been accelerating the necron reawakening. They've tried to cover this up from the Imperium at large, but it's clear they're now losing this war. As such the new Fabricator General decides to fess up to Guilliman.
- Illiyanne Natasé has 4 Dire Avengers as bodyguards on board the Dawn of Fire. According to him, humans stink something awful. To deal with it, he's become addicted to some sort of fragrant oil, repeated use of which damages the skin. He has a particular fascination with humanity, which is why Eldrad decided to send him to advise Guilliman. He tries to warn Guilliman against confronting the Silent King, foreseeing disaster if he does so.
	- Also steel can't shatter wraithbone.
- Our old friend Vitrian Messinius is back. And apparently he hates democracy.
- We saw before how the Primaris marines seem rather wooden and robotic compared to the firstborns. Apparently this isn't really a problem for those Primaris that were created and raised from individual chapters, just the ones Cawl created himself.
    - Yet on that note we also see a first generation Primaris named Thothven who's a bit of a joker. Messinius finds this reassuring.
- Hiax ends up joining Cawl's retinue, mostly because he has no other choice. He's shocked to learn that Cawl is massively more heretical than he is, which is probably saying something.
- Admiral VanLeskus holds a party with all of Fleet Tertius, where our other old friend Eloise Athagey also shows up. The two of them absolutely hate each other. VanLeskus' husband also shows up, but doesn't really do anything. Messinius is at the party too and doesn't think much of him at all. Athagey tries to get Messinius drunk but obviously fails, and VanLeskus tells him he's leaving Fleet Primus and going back to Guilliman.
	- Also, Messinius gives a monologue on his philosophy on rulership which is *interesting*. Someone remind me to post it when a month has past.
- We see Shanni Saintsgift and the Sisters of the Argent Shroud from Gathalamor again. Shanni is apparently blessed by the Emperor so she never gets hit while leading the battle pilgrims under the Sisters' command. They join the fight against the necrons later in the book too, but they die without really really doing anything so I have no idea why they're here. They have a bit of character growth, but that's basically 5 minutes before they all get killed.
- On the way to the Fleet Primus muster, Messinius' ship gets invaded by demons of Tzeentch. A Lord of Change engineered this to trap Messinius specifically and try to convince him to join forces against Nurgle. Messinius obviously refuses, but the Lord of Change isn't too concerned and tells him they'll see each other again when the time's right. This is never brought up again in the book and I'm not sure where they're going with this. It's obviously a reference to the Plague Wars and concurrent war between Nurgle and Tzeentch, but Messinius doesn't appear in the Dark Imperium series. I guess we might see more of it in the future. He refuses to speak of this whole thing with anyone, so nobody knows he even encountered a greater demon.
- The Ad Mech emissary holds the title of Archmagos Emmisarius, so apparently that's a thing. Also, she's a foodie. She likes to eat so much that instead of removing her stomach entirely she just replaced it with a more efficient mechanical system. It doesn't give he enough energy to function, she just likes it.
    - She tries to convince Cawl to make a bid to become Fabricator General, but he (through Qvo) refuses, saying he has no interest in taking any sort of high office because it's too annoying dealing with that sort of thing.
    - It seems that a significant portion of the Ad Mech aren't happy with the current state of affairs. They want to use Cawl as a figurehead in order to take over control of humanity from Terra. This isn't brought up again in the book, so again I guess we'll see where this goes.
    - Also apparently she was supposed to tell Cawl exactly how Raskian died but he refused to meet her in person so she doesn't.
- Messinius meets with Guilliman aboard the Dawn of Fire.
    - We see Guilliman has recovered the Macragge's Honour at this point and is already in the processes of moving his stuff over.
    - Cato Sicarius never takes his hand off his sword hilt, seemingly a form of PTSD from getting lost in the warp.
    - Guilliman still can't take off his suit here, so I guess the Armour of Fate short story takes place after this.
    - Guilliman tells Messinius that the White Consuls are destroyed. Between the fall of Cadia and the fall of Sabatine, only 15 other White Consuls have survived, only one of which is a captain named Borsellius. Both chapter masters are missing and presumed dead. Sabatine has been so thoroughly devasted by the Death Guard's plagues that it had to be quarantined (which I guess means the Death Guard didn't occupy it?). Borsellius is appointed as the new chapter master, while all the Unnumbered Sons of Guilliman left under Messinius' command become White Consuls.
    - Guilliman also talks about breaking up the remaining Unnumbered Sons here, saying politically he should have done it earlier but militarily he should leave it till later. He also mentions the remainder will be grouped into the mixed-lineage units we see at the start of Dark Imperium. So I guess those existed for an extremely short time.

What we've seen so far has mostly been setup, and it's here that Guilliman starts taking the fight to the necrons. We're up to about chapter 23 out of 47, so halfway in.

- His plan is to send the entirety of Fleet Primus to attack a necron pylon on the world of Mesmoch. Meanwhile, the entirety of Fleet Tertius will reinforce Imperial forces left by Battle Group Kallides in the Paradyce system as a distraction.
    - Except as it turns out the Mesmoch attack is also a distraction. Messinius, Cawl, Hiax, and the White Consuls will attack the real target which is an uninhabited planet Cawl calls Planet 7/2, which is apparently some sort of control nexus for the pylon network. This would then allow further forces to go deeper into the Pariah Nexus
    - We also see that no two pylon arrays are the same as each other.
    - Apparently the Ork empire of Charadon is also planning to launch a Waagh at the Nephilim Sector, although this isn't expanded upon.
- On board the Dawn of Fire, Guilliman worked with the ""progressive"" members of the Astra Cartographica to great a hyper-accurate map of the galaxy. Apparently this nearly caused a civil war within the organization.
- Before going into battle, Athagey and VanLeskus get drunk together and share a heart to heart.
    - Athagey is heir to the 14th weathliest noble house on Armageddon. However she has no children. It seems she had a suitor once but that fell through.
	- VanLeskus on the other hand has 3 kid, and seemingly has never met any of them because they were all vat-grown, with the 3rd still incubating. Her husband provided the ""necessary materials"" as agreed to in their marriage contract.
- Also actual coffee exists, and is specified as being distinct from recaf.
- Primus and Tertius go into battle without much trouble. Actually Primus destroys the necron pylon without any resistence at all. Right after they do so though, the necron fleet arrives, and it's massive. Tertius gets hit right while they're deploying troops planetside.
	- Hapthatra the Radiant communicates with Guilliman demanding their surrender, and the two do a whole bunch of boasting. The conversation doesn't really go anywhere, although Guilliman learns from him the name of the Silent King. Then he orders a fighting withdrawl. Tertius just gets attacked immediately.
- Things go kind of okay for Tertius until a Tomb Ship shows up. It hits VanLeskus' flagship with some sort of weapon that instantly collapses the void shields and turns everyone on board numb (not sure if this is new, I don't know much about necron ships), then destroys the ship and kills her.
	- Athagey then takes command and orders the remainder of the fleet to flee. She orders her own battlegroup to act as the rear guard, figures out how to evade the necron weapon, and manages to ram the tomb ship with her battlecruiser, destroying both.
	- Also apparently nova cannons are very inaccurate when used at close range. I have no idea how this works.
	- Somehow Athagey and most of her command staff survive, only to get locked into a tesseract labyrinth. Athagey herself is given the option to surrender to Phaeron Zhulkan, Szarekh's emissary and xenologist, and agrees.
- Guilliman meanwhile decides to use the Dawn of Fire, and himself, as bait while the rest of the fleet bugs out, as it's become obvious he's the necron's target. Colquan absolutely hates this idea, obviously.
	- The necrons board the ship as he prepares to make his evacuations, and a necron lord tries to catch him in a tesseract labyrinth. He gets killed by the Emperor's Sword for the effort. After that the necrons keep sending in warriors but aren't interested in risking any of the higher forms against the sword again.
- Guilliman gets cut off from his evac shuttle (which Colquan managed to board), but Natasé gets him and Sicarius to a webway gate in his quarters instead.
	- Dire Avenger exarchs are nimble enough to outrun/dodge gauss flayers, at least according to Sicarius.
	- They get rescued by a bunch of Eldar Corsairs. However, the necrons seem to have some way of hijacking webway gates, bringing their party face to face with the Silent King. Szarekh and Guilliman prepare to fight mano-a-mano, but Natasé manages to close the gate before they get close.
- While all of this was happening, Messinius and Cawl drop on Planet 7/2. Cawl created some sort of device that lets them infiltrate onto the planet undetected, but after a while these devices fail and they get plunged into combat, killing most of them.
	- Cawl manages to get his job done though, and the survivors, including Alpha Primus, Hiax, and Messinius, manage to flee using a Pharos device. This encourages him to explore the one on Sotha, which we see in The Great Work.
	- Messinius is mortally wounded, but manages to recover because Cawl personally gives him the Primarus treatment.
	- Interestingly the space marines also get heavily affected by the stilling effect of the pylons. This wasn't the case in Indomitus. Not sure if the Pariah Nexus campaign notes said anything on the matter.
	- Despite this, Messinius' reflexes are so good he can give orders without even thinking about it (as he's too deadened to do so consciously)

The final two chapters are essentially the epilogue, and serve to lead into the first Dark Imperium book.

- Guilliman is unhappy with the defeat, even though Cawl succeded, and decides that containment is the only option for the time being. 
- The Macragge's Honour is back, although Sicarius is convinced the ship is unsafe after being held by the Red Corsairs.
	- There's also a fresco of the 500 worlds of Ultramar being painted. Cawl feels deeply disturbed by this, and for the first time considers if Guilliman might want the throne. A bit earlier Colquan also has a bit where he considers that Guilliman definitely doesn't want the throne, but might eventually build a chain of logic where taking it becomes the reasonable conclusion.
- Cawl decides to leave to go do his own research. Before he does so though, he introduces Guilliman to Cawl Inferior, and points him to the Pit of Raukos
	- The pit is chosen as the target for Cawl's pylon test because it's a stable and very predicable warp rift, which makes testing easier. The fact that Chaos is building a fortress next to it also means that the Imperium can use that as an excuse to cover up the reason they're attacking it.
- Guilliman spends a considerable amount of time lamenting to Sicarius about all the mistakes he made post-Heresy, leading up to his fight with Fulgrim. Sicarius is rather disturbed by this.
- Messinius is not in a good way after the surgery, and Sicarius notes the only reason he's not walking with a cane is probably pride. This makes Sicarius even more reluctant to cross the Rubicon.
	- He becomes the new fleetmaster of Fleet Tertius, with the goal of managing the containment efforts around the Pariah Nexus.
	- Earlier when they last met, they noted that the White Consuls would be fleet based for the time being. Here however, Guilliman grants the White Consuls a new homeworld. It's not named in the book, but presumably somewhere near the Nephilim Sector.
	- Interestingly in this book it's stated that the White Consuls *do* in fact see the Emperor as a god. Which is weird because this is a Guy Haley book and he's the one who wrote them as *not* seeing him as a god, just a very special person, a few books earlier. They still note that they're distinct from the Black Templars though, whatever that means.
- Guilliman also talks about going back to Ultramar to deal with the Death Guard, and how he suspects Mortarion is coming back, so more setup for Dark Imperium
	
The last sentence of the book is:

> I will ask everything of you, and with good cause, for it is only with the help of men like you that I can save this Dark Imperium.

So really laying it thick there...

There are no notes on the crusade this time. Instead we get a neat chronological order of the books in the Indomitus era:

- Vaults of Terra: The Dark City
- Dawn of Fire: Throne of Light
- Dawn of Fire: The Iron Kingdom
- Dawn of Fire: The Martyr’s Tomb
- Dawn of Fire: The Sea of Souls
- Indomitus
- Dawn of Fire: The Hand of Abaddon
- Huron Blackheart: Master of the Maelstrom
- Dawn of Fire: The Silent King
- Dark Imperium
- Dark Imperium: Plague War
- Dark Imperium: Godblight
- Belisarius Cawl: The Great Work
- Genefather

- Morvenn Vahl: Spear of Faith
- Steel Tread
- The Horusian Wars: Resurrection

And I think that's everything. I didn't take notes as I was reading it though so there's a possibility I missed something interesting in there.",25,1752863491.0,40kLore,10,0.96,False

since we have grown closer i have been working with her on manifestation - something i oddly have a knack for in weird ways.
* eg: when doing haul #2 from storage the other day i lost one of my butterfly pins that had been on my shirt. i took a little time to look around for it, but didn't find it. this is not that uncommon occurrence for me, losing my shit [😅]. i learned as a child to let these things go, that if they're meant to turn back up they will. 
   - this helps me manage my stress and time
   - a little bit ago today i was looking for something else and my pin popped up 😄
   - this is a very minor example.

circling back to jane, 2 days ago jane manifested things she has desperately been in long time need of and deeply desired:
* a considerable amount of money [long overdue to her]
* a car for herself
* a new home for her and her son 
> all in a single day.

____ 

this now said.. i, too, have been working on my own manifestations. 
* to note - the more substantial the desired outcome is, the longer and more powerful the process is.

in line with all of this, i have something i need to tell someone, somewhere - having no clue if they will ever see this...

> i am sorry

> thank you

> you were right

okay, about time for that nap as the headache wasn't from coffee and i'm still not functional yet.

Day 47 hits, and you're screaming (internally, mostly) ""SARAH, WHERE'S THAT REPORT FROM APRIL?!"" And why does everyone act like adults only when you're watching?!

Yup, the ""self-managing team"" is often a beautiful myth. We've all been there with the Monday Morning Meltdown: ""Project X? Uh, wasn't that due yesterday?"" ""Oh, I thought Mike had it."" ""No, I swear Sarah did!"" ""Sarah's been on vacay for two weeks?!"" 🤦‍♀️


Your ""High-Tech"" System is a Joke! Let's be real, your fancy project management tools are probably just: 47 Slack channels nobody reads (but everyone's in). A Notion page that crashes if you look at it funny. Sticky notes that multiply like crazy.

The ""Helpful"" Tool Shopping Spree (AKA Therapy for Managers): You've tried 'em all! ClickUp, Asana, Monday.com, Jira, Trello... ClickUp wants your firstborn just to color-code your to-do list. Asana keeps bugging you about ""Gantt charts"" (Sir, this is a Wendy's!). Monday.com thinks your 3-person team needs 73 different workflows. Jira? That's what happens when engineers design tools to punish managers. Seriously, why do I need a science degree just to find out if a task is done?!

🎉 Lightbulb Moment! What if tools were built by REAL MANAGERS?! After watching my team jump through hoops with a bazillion tools, I had a wild idea: Most management tools are made by folks who've never actually managed a human.

They think you want: 🌟 47 types of charts! 🌈 Super fancy color codes! 🤖 Robots that break every Tuesday! 🚀 Dashboards that look like NASA mission control! But what do managers REALLY want? ""Who's doing what?"" (Answer in 2 seconds, please!) ""Who's off this week?"" (No treasure hunt required!) ""Is this done?"" (Yes or no! No deep thoughts needed!) ""Can I finally sleep tonight?"" (Without nightmares about forgotten tasks!)

That's why we made EstroWork! It's the rebel tool that's just... simple. No crazy charts, no ""AI"" telling you boring stuff, and no monthly fees that cost more than your coffee habit. Just easy, human-friendly management that makes sense. 🔗 Check it out for yourself: https://ems-one-mauve.vercel.app/

1m3a0py,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1m3a0py/stopping_to_resist_negative_emotions/,Stopping to resist negative emotions,"Hi all,

I wanted to share something that has been making a small difference for me in the last few weeks. Stopping to resist negative emotions. Will this cure your long COVID? Hell no. Will it prevent you from spiraling ever deeper into resentment, bitterness, and negativity? It might. 

Basically, I've been reading some spiritually-inclined books or audiobooks, which I've always enjoyed, and I they helped me with a very precise problem that had gotten worse for me due to long COVID.

For example, when I would see obese coworkers chug a liter of coca cola while eating processed food portions the size of a small dog, then wash it all away with five coffees and be healthier than I am after a year of avoiding anything remotely unhealthy, I would get bitter.

Or when I'd see people who were at the same level I was in jiu-jitsu (martial art) get promoted to a higher belt, I would think: ""Man, this is so unfair, I haven't been able to train for a year and while everyone else gets better, I get worse"".

But also whenever I would have any kind of flare up symptom, even something mild enough that it probably also happened before long COVID, I tensed my whole body and could literally feel my mood plummet and kick open the door to drama, or self-pity, or at least to fear of my conditioning worsening. 

When I was contemplating to do something nice for once, like having brunch with friends or going to the beach, I would immediately panic, imagining having a moment of weakness and having to abandon my friends and crashing.

There are a million more examples, which I am sure any one on this forum could type out in a matter of seconds. For me the main problem is that my ""real life"" is on pause and that I am paying years of ""real life"" to instead live this sorry excuse of a life. 

What helped me most with this thought in particular was reading the book ""The Road Less Traveled"" by Scott Peck:

""Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.""

Reading this one paragraph made me realize that I was expecting my life to be easy for some reason. Expecting it to be fair in the sense that, for example if I eat healthy whereas other people don't, then my life would be better. But life is not fair, and it is not easy.

I expect that different mindsets or perspectives are useful for different people but my point is that by changing my perspective and working on not reacting to these negative emotions or sensations has allowed me to stay more positive, optimistic and has taken a tangible edge off any negative experience. 

Other sources that help me with this:

\- the book ""The Untethered Soul"" by Michael Allen Singer

\- the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu

\- article by Mark Manson (read all the way to ""meta-emotions"" [https://markmanson.net/why-you-shouldnt-trust-emotions](https://markmanson.net/why-you-shouldnt-trust-emotions) 

\- Vipassana meditation

  
Hope this helps someone, often we just need a reminder to not get angry or resentful despite the long-COVID shitstorm! 

All the best

1m39zuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CUTI/comments/1m39zuq/remission_from_cuti/,Remission from CUTI,"Hello everyone!
I have posted on here before a few times and just wanted to give an update/support/positive story. 
I dealt with reoccurring UTIs for the better part of a year (5 within 9 months), I know the pain, desperation, and mourning of a life you had before this condition. It truly is some of the worst pain which impacts not only you, but the people around you. I cannot tell you how many times I ran my closest friends and partner around in circles with talk of my struggles. 
So far, I am four months UTI free, obviously this is not to say it won’t happen again, but this is the longest I have been without in a long time. I did constant research and tried several different methods before I found a routine that has worked for me. 

Here’s what worked for me:

The first thing I would recommend is getting on a long term dose of antibiotics, be persistent with your doctors. I absolutely insist on working with your PCP or a specialist, unfortunately for me I do not have one so I treated myself through research and careful monitoring of my body. I do NOT recommend doing this, but I understand many of you are in the same boat. Keep a running list of UTI occurrences and any medication you’ve used to treat them. Absolutely take note of any triggers this is VITAL. As many of you have voiced, sex is almost always the main trigger, it certainly was for me. Perhaps a little TMI but I noticed certain positions/angles would irritate my bladder and cause a UTI or a flare up at the very least. Also peeing after sex is essential, I know you have heard it, but it’s true. If you cannot pee a decent amount chug some water and pee again. If you’re really worried about it, don’t have intercourse before bed so you can stay awake and make sure you pee again. Pay attention to the time of month they occur, I suspect that sensitivity to them could be linked to parts of your cycle (that’s what I have noticed). 

While taking the antibiotics I took 2000mg daily of D-mannose, a PAC supplement from Genna MD (pricey but worth it imo), and probiotics. I am still taking the supplements daily. I have a low dose 50mg bottle of macrobid as a prophylactic that I take after sex. I firmly believe this has helped reduce the possibility of reoccurrence. 

After my most recent UTI I made a concerted effort to avoid activities that would irritate my bladder and let it heal for over a month. For me this looked like no penetrative sex (there’s other ways to have fun, this doesn’t have to be the death of your intimacy), reduces my caffeine intake dramatically, avoided super acidic food and drink, and absolutely no alcohol. I believe this healing period is critical for your bladders health. 

Since then I have reintroduced coffee (in my preferred amount lol), enjoy spicy foods, and can get alcoholic drinks with friends on the weekend if I choose to. I swim, wear leggings, and workout as hard as I want to without worry of bladder irritation. Me and my partner have returned to our regular sex life, and life is truly looking up again. 

If I get another UTI again I have a plan and I know everything will be okay. I will now be working with a PCP (finally) and there’s options I haven’t explored yet such as MicroGen testing and keflex, which have seemed to be extremely helpful for folks. Always always lean on your community, the people in this subreddit have been amazing, supportive, and resourceful. Thank you all for reading and please do not hesitate to DM me with specific questions if you wish to. :)

# Best Lids for ​Ceramic Coffee Mugs 2025: Top Picks

Finding the perfect lid for yoru ceramic ⁤coffee mug can significantly enhance your‌ coffee-drinking experience.A good lid not only ‍keeps your beverage warm for longer but also prevents ⁤spills, making it an essential accessory for both home and office⁤ use. With a wide variety of options available, ranging from silicone‌ to bamboo to plastic, selecting the right lid can be overwhelming. This ‍review article aims to simplify your decision by highlighting⁤ the top lids for ⁢ceramic coffee mugs in 2025, considering factors like material, ‌fit, heat retention, and ease of cleaning.

[[Explore Top Rated lids for ceramic coffee mugs on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-specials/?kw=lids for ceramic coffee mugs)

## ⁢Key Features Analysis

The best⁢ lids ​for ceramic coffee mugs​ in ‍2025 showcase several key ⁢features that contribute to ‌their functionality and appeal. These range from the ⁢materials⁤ used ​in construction to the overall design intended to ⁢improve user experience.**Material Composition:**⁢ The ‌material of the‍ lid significantly impacts its performance and durability. Silicone lids,for instance,are ‌known ⁤for their flexibility,heat resistance,and non-toxic‌ properties.⁢ They conform well⁢ to different mug shapes and sizes, creating a tight seal.

Bamboo lids offer a more sustainable ⁣and aesthetically pleasing option. They are often treated to be water-resistant and⁢ prevent mold growth. Though, bamboo lids ⁣may ‍not offer‍ the same level of insulation as those made from⁣ silicone ⁤or plastic.

Plastic lids, typically made⁤ from food-grade polypropylene (PP), are lightweight and cost-effective. They are frequently⁢ enough ⁣dishwasher-safe and offer good chemical resistance. However, concerns ‌about BPA and‍ potential leaching have led to a preference for ‍BPA-free​ alternatives.

**Worldwide Fit Design:** One crucial aspect of a reliable ceramic​ mug lid is its capacity to fit various mug diameters.The lids‍ with a universal fit design generally have​ an inner⁤ rim that‍ sits snugly inside the mug's opening,accommodating slight variations in size. Many premium alternatives feature flexible silicone edges that​ create an airtight seal, regardless of minor variances.

The universal ⁢fit designs are often paired⁤ with stepped or conical profiles to accommodate different mug rim thicknesses. A good universal lid ensures compatibility with⁣ an ‌extensive range of‍ ceramic mugs, saving users ⁤from the hassle⁣ of measuring and finding exact ‍matches.

**Heat Retention Capabilities:** ‌Heat retention is a primary function of a ​coffee⁤ mug ⁣lid. A well-designed ‍lid minimizes heat⁤ loss‍ through convection, ⁤conduction,‌ and radiation.‍ Materials like silicone and‍ thicker plastics provide better‍ insulation.

Some lids incorporate double-walled designs ⁣or insulated⁤ inserts to further enhance‍ heat retention. These features create an‍ insulating air gap, which significantly reduces heat transfer and keeps beverages warmer for a prolonged period. Tightly sealed lids also prevent heat from escaping through evaporation,adding ​to their efficiency.

**spill-Proof Construction:** A spill-proof lid is essential for those who take their coffee ‌on the⁢ go or work in busy environments. These lids often feature a secure closure ⁣mechanism, such as a sliding cover or a ‌tightly fitting plug for ⁣the drinking​ spout.

The‌ spill-proof ⁢design ⁤relies⁤ on creating an airtight seal ‌around the mug's opening and the spout. High-quality ⁤lids ​employ flexible gaskets ⁣or O-rings to ensure no leakage, ⁣even when the mug is tilted ⁤or accidentally knocked over.⁤ Vented ‌lids, though effective in preventing pressure build-up, often sacrifice ⁣some spill resistance.

Key features ‍of the best ceramic ‍coffee‌ mug lids:

* ⁢  High-grade silicone molds with airtight seals
*   BPA-free plastic polymers that prevent leaching
*   Insulated,⁤ flexible lids​ designed for thermal insulation
*   Durable construction with tight seals to prevent leaks

**Extended Beverage Warmth:** A primary benefit of using a​ lid is the ability to keep your coffee or tea warm for an extended period. A well-fitted​ lid minimizes ⁢heat loss,⁢ allowing you to savor your drink at your own pace without it⁣ quickly⁤ becoming‌ cold. Silicone and insulated plastic lids are particularly effective at retaining heat, ensuring your ‍beverage ⁤stays enjoyable even during longer meetings or commutes.

**Spill Prevention and Mess Reduction:** A good lid significantly reduces ​the ⁢risk of spills, especially when ‍moving around or working at a⁤ desk. This is particularly useful for preventing⁢ stains on clothes, furniture, ‍or ⁤important documents.Lids with secure closures provide an extra layer of‍ protection, making them ideal for‌ travel or for those ⁤prone⁤ to⁤ accidental bumps.

**Enhanced Hygiene and Protection:** Using a lid helps keep your beverage clean and free from dust, insects,​ or other contaminants, particularly when used outdoors ​or‍ in ⁣shared spaces.This‍ is⁢ especially important for individuals with allergies or ⁣sensitivities. A lid also prevents accidental ​ingestion of foreign objects, providing an extra layer of safety.

**Versatility⁢ and Adaptability:** many lids are designed ‌to fit a variety of‍ ceramic mug sizes ⁢and shapes, making them a versatile ​accessory for different ⁤types of mugs. Universal-fit lids are particularly convenient, as they eliminate the need to purchase‍ specific lids for each mug. This adaptability saves both‍ time and money, allowing you to use the same lid for ‌various purposes.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about lids for ceramic coffee mugs, along⁤ with detailed answers to help you make ⁢informed purchasing‌ decisions.

**What materials are commonly used for coffee mug lids, and⁣ which is the safest?**
common materials​ include silicone, ⁤plastic (polypropylene), and bamboo.⁢ Silicone is generally considered safe due to its heat resistance,‌ flexibility, and lack of harmful chemicals. Look for food-grade or medical-grade silicone. BPA-free plastic is another option, ⁢though silicone is‍ often preferred ⁢for its superior heat resistance ​and non-leaching properties. Bamboo lids ​are increasingly popular for ‌their aesthetic appeal and sustainability but often​ require proper treatment to prevent ⁤mold.

**How can I ensure ⁤a tight and secure fit with my ceramic coffee mug?**
Measure the inside diameter of⁢ your mug's opening before purchasing a lid. Look for lids with⁣ universal fit ⁢designs that ‍feature flexible⁢ silicone edges or stepped profiles to accommodate‌ slight variations in mug ⁤sizes. Reading product reviews ⁢and checking compatibility specifications can also help ensure a​ proper fit. A snug fit is essential ⁢for preventing spills and retaining ⁤heat effectively.**How do I clean and maintain​ my coffee ‍mug ‌lid to⁢ prevent mold ⁤or odors?**
Regular cleaning is crucial to ​prevent ⁣mold⁢ and odors. Wash the lid thoroughly after each ⁤use with warm, soapy water. Silicone and plastic lids are usually dishwasher-safe, but bamboo lids shoudl be hand-washed to avoid water ​damage. Ensure the lid is entirely dry before‍ storing ⁢it. For⁣ stubborn stains or odors, ‍try soaking the lid in a solution of baking soda and water⁤ or using a specialized cleaning brush to reach crevices.

**Do vented lids affect heat retention?**
Yes, ⁢vented lids can reduce heat retention compared to non-vented lids.The vent allows air​ to ‌escape, which can also result ‍in heat loss. However, vented lids prevent pressure build-up and‌ improve flow when drinking, while minimizing‍ splashing. If maximum heat retention is your priority, opt for ⁣a non-vented lid, but be mindful of⁢ potential⁤ pressure issues when using ‌it with vrey ​hot ​beverages.

1m39udz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1m39udz/im_thinking_about_switching_back_to_unsweetened/,I'm thinking about switching back to unsweetened soy milk for protein shakes. Dairy makes me break out if I have big amounts of it and oat milk has too much carbs! I also can't have nut milk because I'm allergic to it! Do any of you drink some soy milk while having PCOS?,So I noticed that when I have too much Dairy I break out even when I drink lactose free milk. The only way I can have coffee is with lactose-free half and half but then if I drink the regular milk dairy too much I start getting some sort of rosacea and my skin gets a bunch of pimples. I also have hypothyroidism on top of that so I'm trying not to drink soy milk too much maybe a couple times a week and I was told that if I do drink it drink it for hours after taking the levitroxine. I heard that it is not the best for women with PCOS which is also what I have as long as you don't drink it in big amounts. What do you guys think? Also it seemed like my cholesterol went up a bit since starting to go back to full on Dairy again where when I had little to no Dairy it was under 200. I would like to try coconut milk which I have but it doesn't have much protein and I'm looking for a milk that does have protein which the one I got has 8 to 9 g of protein.,2,1752862810.0,PCOS,9,1.0,False

1m39st8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m39st8/find_out_if_the_delonghi_nespresso_vertuoplus/,Find Out if the De'Longhi Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker Review Lives Up to Hype,"Testing the **De'Longhi ENV150BM Nespresso Vertuo Plus** coffee and espresso maker has been a daily treat for a caffeine lover like me. Having the convenience of brewing a rich, café-quality espresso or a smooth cup of hot coffee at home is a game-changer. This machine's sleek design and intuitive features made practicality meet elegance right in my kitchen.

**Design and Build**  
The matte black finish is utterly stylish, blending seamlessly into my countertop setup. Its compact dimensions, measuring 15.35"" D x 15.55"" W x 9.45"" H, allow it to fit snugly into limited spaces, while the 40 oz removable water tank is an absolute win for households like mine where multiple people crave coffee throughout the day. The tank placement is adjustable, lingering on the edge for compact kitchens or sitting snugly at the back. I even found myself appreciating the machine's ability to sit quietly during operation, which is a blessing during early mornings.

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
This machine's Centrifusion technology takes brewing to another level. The coffee comes out bold, aromatic, and consistent every single time. I’ve tested various Nespresso Vertuo capsules, and the brew quality remains fantastic across the board. The 25-second heat-up feature is especially handy. On busy mornings when my schedule's crammed, the time saved waiting for a drink is invaluable. With its one-touch brewing, even my not-so-techy parents found it incredibly straightforward.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compatible with various Nespresso Vertuo capsules.  
- Automatically ejects used capsules, and the container holds up to 10, ensuring hassle-free disposal.  
- Energy-saving with automatic shutoff after inactivity.  
- Versatility with 4 cup-size options catering to different preferences.  

[Check De'Longhi ENV150BM price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gbjq38k/)

**Flavor Versatility**  
This coffee maker isn’t just adaptable in size—it also caters to a range of tastes. Whether it’s a bold 7.77 oz coffee or an airy single espresso shot, I could alternate between these depending on my mood. Pouring it over ice, as I did on a hot afternoon, turned into a refreshing iced coffee treat. No extra steps, no confusion—just consistent results!

**Convenience in Included Features**  
A small detail that repeatedly stood out was the machine’s complimentary starter set of Nespresso Vertuo capsules. This inclusion meant I could start brewing right out of the box. I also appreciated its hands-off cleaning approach. Reusable filter design reduces waste, which aligned nicely with my goals to maintain a more eco-conscious home environment.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The proprietary capsules can be limiting for those who prefer third-party options.  
- Despite its sturdy design, the lightweight build (just 2.72 ounces!) occasionally made it slide slightly when overenthusiastically pressing the single-button mechanism.  
- The initial capsule assortment may not appeal to everyone’s tastes.

**Drawbacks**  
- Water tank placement awkward for small-dimension spaces if not adjusted well.  
- Capsules cost a bit higher compared to traditional coffee grounds.  
- No manual temperature controls, limiting customization for enthusiasts.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to competitor models like the Breville Vertuo Next, the De'Longhi ENV150BM feels more refined in user experience. Breville’s design, while equally capable in taste, appears slightly bulkier and presents a bit of a learning curve to unlock advanced settings. However, the Keurig K-Elite offers budget-friendly multi-use pods but sacrifices detailed customization and the espresso finesse found in this Nespresso model.

**True Value**  
Considering its fully automated operation, 20+ ounce capacity for water, and variety in coffee strengths, this machine screams premium with every drip. While the capsules are priced higher than standard ground coffee or pods used in Keurigs, the results justify the expense when sipping on morning espressos that beat most cafes. Plus, knowing I can skip morning Starbucks saves me big bucks long-term.

1m39sor,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m39sor/should_you_try_geesta_charcoal_water_filters_for/,Should You Try Geesta Charcoal Water Filters for Cuisinart Coffee Machines Review?,"Trying out the Geesta Geesta09 12-Pack Replacement Charcoal Water Filters for my coffee machine turned out to be an enlightening adventure. Between my caffeine-fueled mornings and occasional lazy afternoons, relying on this product daily shed light on its efficacy, ease of use, and little quirks. Designed to reduce impurities while enhancing flavor, this pack of filters brings a practical solution to coffee aficionados seeking cleaner and better-tasting brews. Keep reading for an in-depth, firsthand analysis—spoiler: there's both good and bad.

**Ease of Use and Practicality**  
I tossed one of these filters into my Cuisinart coffee machine and was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward the process was. Each filter is individually sealed, which is not only convenient but also ensures the filters stay fresh until you're ready to use them. The instructions, though basic, make it clear how to install and replace them. I appreciated that they cater to multiple Cuisinart models, including the Grind & Brew, Burr Grind & Brew, and PerfecTemp series, so it felt like a versatile option for most users. The lightweight and compact designs further simplify handling, especially during those first groggy moments of the day.

**Performance Highlights**  
What caught my attention was the immediate improvement in taste after replacing the old filter with this one. The Geesta charcoal filters are designed to reduce impurities like chlorine, calcium, and odors, and the quality of every coffee cup proved this claim. Living in an area with notoriously hard water, I can attest that this filter softened the overall taste of my morning brew significantly. Tea drinkers in my household also noticed a difference when we used filtered water for tea—brew clarity and smoothness were undeniably better. 

[Check Geesta Geesta09 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b06vwk3jgj/)

**Build Quality and Packaging**  
These aren't just basic filters. The material quality feels premium, with tightly packed charcoal ensuring efficient filtration. Each set of 12 comes carefully packaged in a sturdy box, preventing any accidental damage during storage. Individually wrapping each filter is another touch that shows attention to preserving quality. It's a detail you don’t often see with similar products, and it ensures you're not dealing with potentially contaminated or dusty filters.

**Benefits**  
- Noticeable improvement in coffee and tea flavor.  
- Individually sealed filters maintain freshness until use.  
- Universal compatibility with commonly used Cuisinart models.  
- Compact and lightweight, making replacements hassle-free.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The fit isn’t always snug in every Cuisinart reservoir.  
- Each filter’s lifespan might feel short for regions with very hard water.  
- No indication on the filter itself when it’s time for replacement.  

**Design Considerations**  
The dimensions, 0.71""D x 1.68""W x 1""H, are pretty standard for most water filters, and the lightweight build (0.09 kg) makes using and storing them straightforward. One downside I noticed is that in some models, the fit may not be as snug as expected. It doesn’t affect functionality massively, but a tighter fit would give more peace of mind during operation. Visually, the white finish helped highlight any impurities they might have trapped, which becomes a neat visual cue for when it might need replacing.

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing these with other charcoal water filters, such as those offered by Keurig or off-brand alternatives, Geesta’s packaging and quality control noticeably stand out. Keurig’s filters are well-regarded but often come at a higher price point and lack the same robust packaging. Off-brands, on the other hand, might be more affordable but often compromise on performance and durability. While some competitors offer indicators for filter replacement, the Geesta pack still maintains its appeal due to its premium filtration material and consistent results.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Despite being slightly pricier than the average no-name replacements, the Geesta filters offer exceptional value when you consider their efficacy in improving water quality and enhancing beverage flavor. You could likely save pennies with off-brands, but the taste difference might leave you second-guessing those savings. For anyone who drinks coffee daily like I do, it feels like a worthwhile investment to ensure great-tasting cups every time.

1m39sm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1m39sm3/action_is_focus/,Action is Focus,"Another gem from Andrea Schulman:

In one of her recent ""lives"" on YouTube, she said, slightly paraphrased, ""action is a form of focus""....that's all.

People are a little hazy on when and where to take physical action, but this is a fantastic way to look at it. I have seen manifestation content creators on YouTube flat-out discourage physical action, encourage you to be as ""lazy"" as possible at all costs.

In the end, its whatever works to help you focus into the parallel reality you want.

If utter detatchment, just sipping your iced coffee and going about your daily life helps you feel that you already have it (or what some people call ""lazy manifesting"") and nothing else works....then do that.

Physical action is good too. There's sort of an energy of momentum in it and a feeling of ""this is happening,"" as Andrea has said. As long as you are crystal clear that it's not the action in and of itself that's making anything happen. But if it helps you maintain your focus on the subject and a feeling that it's yours, then do it.

Visualizing is good. Affirming is good. Whatever helps you keep the focus on the subject and help you enbody it? It is all good.

Anyone who tries to tell you any method is ""wrong"" is a big red flag. It's different for everybody.

The key element is fun. You enjoy doing it, whatever it is you're doing to maintain your focus into your preferred parallel. ",6,1752862696.0,Manifestation,3,0.88,False
