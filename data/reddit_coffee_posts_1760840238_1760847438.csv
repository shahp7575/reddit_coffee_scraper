1oag9r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/1oag9r6/aita_for_feeling_completely_unappreciated_and/,AITA for feeling completely unappreciated and taken advantage of by my resident partner? I'm hitting a wall.,"Warning! Long post! Hi everyone, first time posting here and I just need to vent and maybe get some outside perspective. I'm a med spouse and my partner is a PGY-1. We have been dating for several years.

Things have been incredibly hard lately, and I'm honestly just exhausted.

Backstory (The Shift):
During my partner's M4 year, the chore dynamic was different. Since they had more flexibility with their schedule, they did most of the house work, which I was incredibly grateful for, and I helped out as much as possible around my own demanding schedule. Even then, they voiced concern about the shift to residency, worrying they'd be too exhausted to do anything once the 70-hour weeks started, and that they would do a second shift as they were worried that I would not contribute.

My schedule was brutal: I was teaching full-time, going to school full-time for night classes, and tutoring on weekends just to make extra money. I was also covering most of our expenses (rent, groceries, car, etc.) for years, never once asking to be paid back, I just saw it as supporting us both through this phase.

The Current Situation (Residency Move):
We moved to a completely new state for residency. I now work from home, and my schedule is much more flexible, so I'm happy to take over the household duties just as my partner did for me. I also ask them to try cover the finance for a year like I did before.

The Finances: We're renting from my family, and my partner was footing the full bill for four months. My partner recently brought up that this was ""unfair"" and we needed to talk about splitting the costs. I was taken aback, considering I covered almost everything for years (and never called that ""unfair"") while they were in school. I've agreed to start splitting costs next month. This month, I paid for everything again (thousands of dollars) to hit a sign-up bonus on a new credit card, and they haven't offered to reimburse me for their half.

The Housework Double Standard: I'm doing nearly all the housework now, which is fine since I work from home and have more free time. However, my partner has been doing absolutely nothing lately. They'll come home after their 70-hour week and crash on the couch. Then, they mentioned that we need to ""tidy up the house because it's a mess."" This was after I was gone for a day, and we were out all weekend, and there were piles of dishes from their own cooking left everywhere. When I brought up that they haven't been doing much, I got the classic ""I work 70 hours a week"" excuse. I try to put myself in their shoes and I understand how exhausting residency is. But, while they are too exhausted to clear their own dinner plate, they make time for friends. I literally cleaned the entire place top-to-bottom so their friends could come over to paint together, and all the dishes they used to make cakes to celebrate a friend’s birthday.

Today, they fondly brought up how nice it was when I used to wake up early to make them coffee each morning for a couple of weeks, and suggested it would be nice if I did that again. This detail, combined with their zero effort, just felt like such a slap in the face. It perfectly summarizes the entitlement: they expect me to take care of everything with no reciprocity. On top of that I have been working really hard on the surprise proposal, and feeling really lost.

The Future/Finances Mismatch: They want nice things (a real diamond engagement ring, a nice wedding dress, a nice venue), but when I try to find ways to make extra money (reselling things, growing plants to sell), they get angry at me for it as they take up space. I confronted them about how they never try to make extra money with a side hustle, and it's always the excuse that medical school/residency is too much. The hypocrisy of demanding expensive things while refusing to even consider contributing to that future and getting mad at me for trying is infuriating. We are at a point that we make enough together to support a better life style, but coming from a finance teacher perspective, I try to limit the spending on necessities so we can have money for experiences like traveling and eating out now and then.

I feel like I'm not just a med spouse, but a resident's caretaker, accountant, and maid, and I'm getting little appreciation for years of sacrifice and they seem to have forgotten the years I was financially supporting them! Whenever I brought this up they would say they have equally contributed!! Like what!
What do I do? Any suggestions on how to have a constructive conversation about the lack of appreciation, the unbalanced finances, and the clear double standard of being ""too tired"" for me but not for friends? I'm at my wit's end.
TL;DR: Partner did most chores when they had time in M4, but now that I have time, they do nothing and complain about the mess. They expect me to split rent after I covered all their expenses for years, get angry when I try to make side income for the ""nice things"" they demand, and always have time for friends but not for helping.",2,1760847271.0,MedSpouse,0,1.0,False
1oag8p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1oag8p7/brand_new_to_espresso_crowd_pleaser_espresso/,Brand New to Espresso- crowd pleaser espresso brands?,"Hey guys, I’m brand new to espresso. I have literally never pulled a shot. My company just opened up a small office, and there’s roughly 15 full time employees there, virtually all of whom love espresso. The main drip coffee makers are in the break room, and (upon the recommendation of many) I’ll have the Gaggia classic pro evo RI9380/48. I’m learning about a few of the different mods I’ll be installing, but I’m starting from ground zero. I’ve been wanting to learn the art for a few years now, and I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to make a few drinks for my peers each day and get some experience and constructive criticism. Thankfully I have a full kitchen sink in my personal office, so that I won’t make too much of a mess.

I was wondering- if 90% of the time, I’d be making lattes & cappuccinos, would I notice a huge difference between a fancy brand and a mid one? Especially on a relatively inexpensive system like the one I purchased, I was wondering; where does the graph flatten— how lazy can I be (within reason), and at what point would I be wasting my effort & money for only negligible improvements?

For example, I don’t even have a grinder. Do I absolutely need one if I’m going to be adding in half & half and sugar? After the upgrades have been installed (bottomless portafilter, that small spring, etc) what is the bare minimum I can get by with and still have a decent shot? I don’t really have a palate for it yet, but I’m sure some of the others in that office do.

If I just bought pre ground espresso once a week from a local roaster, does that defeat the purpose of the system I bought? If so, which grinder should I get? 

I just worry because I’ve had some espresso shots in my life that were super harsh and acidic. I’ve had others that, while maybe less complex and probably a shot y’all would consider boring, were super smooth. 

If you were in my shoes, what ‘crowd-pleaser’ brand(s) of espresso would you keep stocked? 
All other advice is welcome too.
Thank you in advance.


TL;DR
I bought this system because everyone recommends it— never pulled a shot, didn’t buy a grinder, zero palate for espresso— but I want to learn by making drinks for myself and others.
What beginner friendly brands of espresso (and gear) should I get?

1oag7mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1oag7mx/what_to_do_in_london_besides_westminster_abbey/,What to do in London besides Westminster Abbey and Big Ben?,"Just got back from an incredible 2-week trip to London and wanted to share some hidden gems I discovered beyond the usual tourist spots. While Westminster Abbey and Big Ben are absolute must-sees (I'll get to my recommended tour for those in a bit), there's so much more to explore in this amazing city.

First things first - if you haven't visited Westminster Abbey yet, I highly recommend booking this guided tour I took: [WestminsterAbbey2]. The Blue Badge guide was incredibly knowledgeable and the skip-the-line access saved us hours of waiting. But let me share what else I found worth checking out:

Camden Market turned out to be one of my favorite spots. The energy there is electric, with endless food stalls serving everything from traditional British pies to amazing international cuisine. The vintage shops and artisan crafts are perfect for unique souvenirs.

The British Museum often gets overlooked by first-time visitors, but it's completely free and houses some of the world's most important artifacts. I spent nearly 4 hours there and barely scratched the surface. The Egyptian collection is mind-blowing.

For something off the beaten path, check out Neal's Yard in Covent Garden. It's this tiny, colorful courtyard tucked away from the main streets. Great spot for photos and some excellent cafes.

Don't miss Borough Market - especially if you're a foodie. Go hungry and try the cheese samples, fresh oysters, and amazing street food. The coffee at Monmouth is worth the wait in line.

Richmond Park was a pleasant surprise. Just a short tube ride from central London, you'll find yourself in a massive park with wild deer roaming around. The views from the top of the hill are spectacular.

Speaking of views, skip the London Eye (too expensive and touristy) and head to Sky Garden instead. It's free if you book in advance, and the views are arguably better.

Before I forget - if you're planning to visit Westminster Abbey (which you absolutely should), book this tour: [WestminsterAbbey2]. The guide's insights really brought the history to life, and having skip-the-line access made a huge difference. Plus, they include stops at Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, so you're getting three major landmarks in one go.

One last tip - consider getting the London Pass if you're planning to visit multiple attractions. It saved me quite a bit of money and time.

Has anyone else discovered some hidden gems in London? Would love to hear your experiences!",1,1760847076.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

1oag3ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/TameImpala/comments/1oag3ag/deadbeat_rollout_a_missed_opportunity/,“Deadbeat” Roll-out: A Missed Opportunity,"**- marks the missed opportunity if you want to skip the intro.

I’ll start by saying “Deadbeat” was a swing and miss for me on first listen. It’s grown on me since, but overall it’s a nice easy-listening album that feels like Steely Dan did house/disco (not a bad thing). For context I’ve listened to Tame since “Lonerism” and have enjoyed each and every project they’ve put out. I’ve also been absorbed by the electronic music scene since Covid (5-6 years give or take). I don’t want to ramble too much, so I’ll cut to the chase. I like house, techno, rock, experimental, etc, etc. A house Tame Impala album seemed like an exciting next step for the group.

Now that I’ve had more time with the album it’s clicking, but I think Tame, Columbia, and Co. missed an enormous opportunity on the album roll-out.

First — we’re accepting that this is pretty much Kevin stepping into the electronic genre. No longer do we have the full band consistently in the mix, and as a Pond, GUM, and The Growl fan this makes me a bit sad. 

Should they keep the Tame Impala name? 

Yes, unfortunate reality is that a big name like Columbia would not want to take the risk of putting out a Kevin Parker side project, and especially one that took 5-years since the last release.  The music industry is here to make money. 

**Which brings me to the missed opportunity:

Kevin should have done more electronic/club performances prior to the LP release under another moniker. “DJ Deadbeat”? Maybe not, but something like how Chaz from Toro y Moi used the “Les Sins” alias. Maybe the first couple of shows are low-key until the word circles. 

Jamie XX did “The Floor” in LA, NYC, and London. Small capacity venues, minimal production, and killer line-ups for about a week residency in each city. I’ve chatted with Jamie after one of his Armory set and he told me that the Floor shows were crucial to finishing his latest album, “Life”.

Another example, love or hate him, Fred Again.., used this method to perfection, and it has allowed for experimentation before he decides to release any studio tracks. 

Why would this work?

Lot Radio is the perfect example. Hoards of people flocked to see Kevin’s “Secret Set”, and to be frank it was … okay. Nothing special, and he didn’t experiment much at all. I skipped the event because I’ve been to The Lot, and it is nice to grab a coffee or beer, chill on the benches to the side and listen to different DJ’s mix. It’s not built for last minute gatherings, and especially not for ones of Kevin’s caliber. 

If Kevin & co started getting some DJ gigs here and there, momentum would have grown, and the potential to evolve the album would have also skyrocketed, and as fans, much of the sound would be known. To take off the pressure, invite other DJ’s to these gigs to carry a bit of the load. Hopefully Kevin would resist cueing hits and go fully experimental, but that’s a pipe dream, just like this journal entry. I can’t be the only one thinking “End of Summer” had the perfect opportunity to go higher BPM and go full-disco.

- I’ve always had quite bad health anxiety, especially related to my heart 
- no heart disease in my family that I know of
- no smoking
- i’m very active, i run 4x a week and lift the other 3

Anyway, on wednesday morning I woke up and I was feeling anxious, and immediately i started having heart palpitations. I didn’t worry tooooo much at first but i was like hmm weird. They persisted literally the whole day. Non stop. It felt like every few beats I was having one. I went to the ER and of course they decreased but they did find some on an ECG. They did bloodwork but didn’t mention it. Basically said it’s PVC, they’re not harmful at my level, and told me to drink gatorade. 

They have persisted pretty much constantly until now. Except today I drank a shitload of coconut water and they have been MUCH less today? I kinda feel them mostly when I sit in a certain position now. Was I just super dehydrated? 

I started thinking about potential triggers, and I was thinking of all of these culminating factors from the weekend could result in sudden, intense, nonstop PVCs for several days? Has this happened to anyone before and did it ever subside eventually without explanation? 

Oct 10: 
- went on a run and travelled for 8 hours. 
- probably didn’t hydrated nearly enough

Oct 11: 
- travelling, 
- had a lot of coffee trying local coffee shops. 
- had 1 drink at dinner 

Oct 12: 
- hiked 10km, probably didn’t drink enough water. 
- Had 2 coffees. 
- Then we went caving which made me quite anxious and I had a few heart palpitations in there but once we were done it stopped. 
- had 2 beers with dinner 

Oct 13: 
- travelled back home
- had a couple coffees
- likely not hydrating enough

Oct 14:
- back to work
- i work in healthcare and we are notorious for being dehydrated 
- no heart palpitations UNTIL i went to the gym after work and had a few during my workout. nothing crazy though

Oct 15 - now:
- nonstop PVCs

The only thing seeming to help is coconut water but I am a bit worried to drink too much as I don’t want to make things even further out of whack. I was referred for a holter monitor and to a cardiologist I believe. I wasn’t overly anxious leading up to this except for 2 hours caving. Now I am super anxious feeling the PVCs all the time 😔

Any insight/advice is very appreciated! 

Edit:
- I’ve been on vyvanse for 3 years, no change in dose. I stopped my vyvanse after wednesday and cut caffeine and still having PVCs. 
- typically i deal with stress by exercising, but i haven’t ran or exercised much since Wednesday because I am scared it will make it worse. ",1,1760846428.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

1oafv15,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oafv15/i_bought_a_cursed_chessboard_from_an_antique_shop/,I bought a cursed chessboard from an antique shop. What initially felt like a good haggle became a nightmare.,"My name is Elias, and when it comes to surviving the rigors of life; chess has always been my cope of choice. In a world brimming with chaos, deadlines, breakups, and endless doom scrolling; the board was my realm of sanctuary.

Sixty-four squares of pure logic, where kings fall and pawns rise, all under my control. Or so I had led myself to believe.

It started last fall, during one of those rainy afternoons that make you crave the old and forgotten.

I wandered into an antique shop on the edge of town, the kind with dust-caked windows and a bell that jingled like an unheeded omen.

The owner, an elderly man with eyes like marbles that have lost their once splendorous sheen, nodded from behind the counter. ""Looking for a challenge?"" he rasped with a smirk on his face; as if he knew exactly why I was there.

Tucked in a corner, half-buried under tarnished silverware, was the chess set. Ebony and ivory pieces, carved with intricate details; knights with snarling horse heads and queens with crowns like thorny vines.

The board itself was comprised of mahogany, worn smooth from countless games, with faint scratches that shared a striking resemblance to runes I have read about.

I could not identify them, but the exquisite craftsmanship of this etchings magnified my desire to acquire this antique; a desire I struggled not to reveal on my face as I conversed with its seller.

""Belonged to a grandmaster,"" the old man said, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""Lost his mind in the end. Played one game too many."" I laughed it off. Classic salesman pitch.

I had already been convinced to buy it; now it was a game of how low the price could go. His initial price was $333 Employing my strategic bartering skills I haggled him down to 200 bucks.

As I left, he muttered something under his breath: ""Beware the eternal match."" I didn't think much of it. Was this roleplaying part of his stores appeal? Well it worked.

I had already begun to fantasize what I would purchase on my next visit. Maybe something to with an aesthetic that would pair well with this new game. That night, back in my cramped apartment, I set up the board on my coffee table.

The rain hammered against the window like impatient fingers. I brewed myself a cup of tea, dimmed the lights, and decided to play a solo game. Me against myself, to practice openings.

I moved white's pawn to e4. Standard King's Pawn Opening. Then black's to e5. Mirror image gambit.

But as I reached for the next piece, I froze with hesitation. The black knight... had it shifted to another square? Just a fraction, from g8 to... no, it was still there. Must be the shadows, I told myself.

Or my excitement of playing on such a luxurious board. Shaking my head I continued, but the air felt thicker, like the room was holding its breath.

By move ten, I was deep into the match, queens exchanged, rooks eyed each other across the board.

That's when I heard it; a soft click. Like wood on wood.

I looked down. My white bishop was gone from c4. Not fallen over.... gone! My heart skipped. I searched the floor, the couch cushions. Nothing. ""Okay, Elias,"" I muttered, ""calm your excitement.""

I looked at my cup of tea which should have been soothing my nerves, but was seemingly failing to do so.

I reset the piece from memory and finished the game. White won in a checkmate that felt too easy. As I packed away the set, I swear the black king toppled over on its own, rolling under the table with a clatter.

The dreams started that night. I was at the board, but my opponent was a shadow; faceless, with hands like claws. Every piece I captured screamed, tiny voices echoing in my skull. ""Sacrifice,"" it whispered.

""The game demands sacrifice."" I woke up sweating, the clock read 3:33 AM. My mind whirled to the boards original price; $333. Coincidence, right?

The next day, I couldn't shake the anxious cloud around me. Work was a blur. I'm a data analyst, crunching numbers that suddenly looked like chess coordinates. On my lunch break, I googled the set's markings.

Nothing definitive, but one forum post caught my eye: ""Cursed boards from the 1800s. Tied to Reznura or some forgotten master. Players vanish."" Bollocks, I thought. Urban legends spun up for clout.

But that evening, I set it up again. This time, I played black.

Move one: White's pawn advanced on its own. I blinked, rubbed my eyes. No, it hadn't. Had it? I laughed nervously and responded. But by move five, it happened for real.

The white knight had leaped forward. Not slid, leaped! Landing with a thud that vibrated through the table. I jumped back, knocking over my chair.

""What the hell?"" The room grew cold, frost was creeping on the window despite the blasting of the heater.

I should have stopped. Thrown the thing out. But chess players... we're addicts. The challenge pulled me in. ""Fine,"" I whispered. ""Let's play."" I made my move.

The board responded instantly; pieces glided like they were alive, guided by invisible strings. The game was brutal. It anticipated every trap, and every gambit I threw at it.

I lost a pawn, and outside, a car alarm blared; my neighbor's, the one who always parked too close. Hmm coincidence?

Then I captured its rook. A sharp pain stabbed my finger; a splinter from the board? No, blood welled up from nowhere. And in the distance, sirens wailed. Later, the news app pinged: ""Local accident. Pedestrian hit by reckless driver.""

The victim? My ex-boss, the one I'd cursed under my breath a hundred times. My hands shook as I stared at the board. The captured rook lay on its side, stained red.

That night, the dreams intensified. The shadow opponent leaned in, its breath like decay. ""Each capture claims a soul,"" it hissed. ""Play to the end, or join the pieces."" I woke to find the board set up again, pieces in mid-game position.

My white king was surrounded, one move from checkmate. But I hadn't touched it.

I tried to research more. Dug into chess history; stories of Paul M, the prodigy who went mad, seeing ghosts in every endgame. Or the Mechanical Turk, that hoax automaton that hid a human inside. But this... this was no hoax.

I posted anonymously on Reddit's r / chess ""Haunted chess set? Pieces move alone."" The replies were mixed; trolls laughing, and a few serious ones linking to occult sites. One user DM'd me: ""Destroy it. ""It's the immortal game reborn; but with real immortals!""

I couldn't destroy it. The pull was too strong. That evening, compelled by the mystery, I sat down. The board waited, white's turn to move. As I advanced a pawn, my phone buzzed, a text from an unknown number: ""Your move.""

My blood ran cold. I responded on the board. Click. Another text: ""Good. But the queen is vulnerable.""

The game dragged on for hours. With each capture, reality warped around me. I took a bishop, my landlord called, screaming about a burst pipe flooding his apartment below mine. He slipped in the water, broke his arm.

Ambulance lights flashed outside. Coincidence? No. The board was feeding on the last few strands of stability my life had to offer. The irony that this board I had assumed; like many other boards would provide my life with peace and serenity was injecting chaos into my world with surgical precision; was not lost on me.

It captured my knight. Pain exploded in my leg. A cramp? No, I collapsed, my knee buckling like it'd been kicked by an assailant with a steel toe'd boot. I limped to the mirror: a bruise forming, shaped like a hoof.

Panic set in. I swept the pieces off, but they rolled back into place, one by one. The black king up righted itself with a defiant click. ""Finish the game,"" a voice echoed. Not in my head, in the room!

Low, gravelly, like the antique shop owner but distorted.

I played on, sweat dripping onto the squares. The entity was masterful – it forced me into a zugzwang, where every move worsened my position.

I sacrificed my queen to buy time. Outside, thunder cracked, and my sister's FaceTime call came through: ""Elias? The power's out, and... oh Goodness, the dog's not breathing!"" Her golden retriever, Queen, dead from a sudden seizure.

I screamed, hurling the board against the wall. It landed perfectly, pieces undisturbed.

The final night. I barricaded the door, but the board was there, glowing faintly in the dark. The shadow from my dreams materialized; not fully, just an outline at the table. ""Resign, and you lose your soul,"" it said.

""Win, and claim mine.""

We played. Hours blurred into eternity. It was the game of my life. Feints, deceptions, discovered checks. I cornered its king, whispering ""check."" The shadow laughed.

""Mate in three."" But I saw it – a flaw in its defense. With trembling fingers, I moved my rook.

""Checkmate.""

The shadow shrieked, dissolving into smoke that seeped into the board. The pieces trembled, then laid still. I had claimed victory. Relief washed over me. I boxed the set, drove to the river at dawn, and hurled it in.

I watched it sink. But that night, as I lay in bed, a click echoed from the closet. I opened my closet to find waiting for me; the board, dry and waiting. A new piece on the white side: a pawn carved in my likeness, eyes wide in terror.

The game never ends. The sacrifices are steep.... and the rewards are hollow.",1,1760845915.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1oafuv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1oafuv1/my_imagination_of_the_future/,My imagination of the future,"It’s too long 

What do you think happens from here? Social media platforms and technology? Do you think social media technology will advance? How?

1. I think in the future, social media will advance from how we use it to make it more interactive and fun. For example, content like videos and images will change from flat to 3D ,,, you interact with social media just like real life. So, it will blend VR. You wear those headsets or contact lenses that have VR tech, and airpods-like thing. And then you can interact with posts on social media as if it was real life. You comment with voice/sound, can view a photo in 3D-7D ,,, a more realistic experience.

Holographic communication will be possible. You can talk to someone as if they’re there physically and have a sensation of their physical presence. 

2. With the blockchain technology, Web3, all digital content will be tokenized such that you set something like metadata or file permissions limiting/controlling how your post like photos or video or voice notes can be shared,, limit within the group, platform etc, things like memes and other content, you can set it such that people can’t use without paying. For instance, to share a meme, you pay some amount split to smallest units which the owner can redeem to real money. Your internet presence will be reduced to something like a wallet address. You don’t need to create account on every platform or set different usernames and passwords etc, just 1 identifier gives you access to any social media platform, access every part of the internet 

3. How humans will become immortal-like. At birth, they embed like a chip which will download and store your memories , learn how think and behave, and then some language model, … they are all interconnected..an AI trained using this data. Once you die, this can be installed on a machine (humanoid) … looks like you, behaves and thinks like you. In that memory, you’ll think you are you .. the only issue is the body is a machine, … so you live forever … a soul-less being/version of you. 

4. By this time they will have engineered humans genetically to ensure no defiance in human behaviour. And then the physical world will become digitised like tokenised. You don’t need to drive to work. You live work and do everything within your estate/the place you live.  The estates are fully-equipped with all social amenities and everything you need. Say, you want to go somewhere, everything will be like tolled roads. You pay for everything. And if climate change gets worse and air becomes so polluted, you’ll pay to live in neighbourhoods with cleaner air, 

Then humanity gets cruel. They put down people just the way they do pets. If you become problematic and your actions threaten the group’s well-being, they just put you down. They install your memories on the humanoid machine… and that machine now is used as a slave since it can be controlled 

5. Things like tv, smartphone, etc,, will be embedded in the body. Like contact lenses that have tv/phone capabilities. Or tiny wearable devices. You don’t save contacts or install apps. Everything/app/service becomes is available. You just say if you want to call, and the person using that universal identifier i mentioned earlier… Then it retrieves the person and makes the call through the tiny wearable device or chip embedded in your body. 

It gets to a point where everyone who’s born ends up successful. There’s no competing for resources or opportunities… everyone has something allocated for them to do throughout their lives. And you don’t get paid your money to manage it. The money is deposited to your account linked to your universal identifier but you can’t withdraw. Each service you acquire, the expense is deducted automatically. There’s a giant system that links everything into 1. Whether you’re taking coffee, paying rent, etc, they scan your universal identifier + service requested and expense is deducted. So there’s no chance of hoarding or saving for the future and having stress about finances and everything. You’re born successful and live like that forever. Everyone is put into use. And the amount allocated to you depends on your usefulness/the value you contribute. 
For example, as a farmer, you just do your work. Pay is added to your universal identifier and you spend the tokens acquiring services etc. farm input is provided by corporations and no manual labor … just using machines everywhere. Same to all professions… no idlers unless you’ve lots of money like owners of corporations… it could be fantastic if the cost for goods and services was relative to a person’s income. Say, a 500ml of water costs different- cheapest to those earning the least and expensive to the wealthy. 


That’s my imagination of the future.

# Sounds

 

That night started quietly. But for once, the world seemed slightly more alive. The first little bit of wildlife I had seen in a while. A racoon. He was dancing though the grass by my porch. I let him be as I enjoyed his company. Dante even came out with me, curled by the fire like he wasn’t afraid anymore. Maybe he wasn’t. Maybe we both just needed a break.

I sat there staring into the flames, thinking about Pete and Sarah—where they could’ve gone. Their car was still parked out front. Maybe they’ve gone to stay with family or are held up somewhere else in town. Maybe I’d ask Tommy about it next time I swung by.

Eventually, the fire winded down. Dante and I made our way back inside. As I stepped on the porch, I noticed a ball of gray fur curled atop my rocking chair. The racoon was fast asleep.

“Stay as long as you want friend” I liked the idea of having him around.

 I left a slice of bread on the porch for him when he wakes up.

Dante jumped up on the bed, and for a little while, things felt normal. I fell asleep to the sound of his soft breathing. Morning came sharp. Sunlight punching through the window like it had a job to do. Dante licked my face awake. I groaned, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, and staggered to the kitchen to heat up some coffee. I slung my rifle over my shoulder and opened the door.

The hairball was gone and so was the bread.

“I hope to see him again” I thought

“Alright,” I said, watching Dante hop into the truck with a bit more energy than usual,

“Glad to see you’re doing better, buddy.”

I climbed in, turned the key—and the engine sputtered, coughed… then belched up a fat plume of gray smoke.

“God damn it!” I shouted, slamming my fist against the wheel. Dante jumped in his seat, startled.

I stepped out and popped the hood, the smoke curling up into the morning air like some kind of omen. “It’s always something, huh?” I muttered to no one, watching the haze slither up my windshield. I popped up my hood.

Coolant leak. Nothing I couldn’t patch up. For now—it means no hunting. I grabbed my tools from the cabin and settled into the slow, frustrating rhythm of repair work.

Hours passed. The world around me stayed mostly silent. Just the creak of trees swaying against each other. The occasional clank of a wrench on steel. And snow—heavier now—drifting down like dust from a forgotten ceiling.

Then I heard Dante.

He barked once. Then again. Loud. Panicked.

I dropped everything and ran around the back of the cabin. He was staring straight up into the trees—still barking, tail stiff, body trembling. The tops of the pines rocked from side to side, but I didn’t see anything.

“What is it?” I asked, squinting into the branches.

That’s when I heard it.

A scream. A woman’s scream.

Close. Too close.

It was loud. Bone-shattering loud. I dropped to my knees and covered my ears. Dante collapsed beside me, yelping. The scream dragged on, echoing through the trees, shaking the cabin behind us. Then—just as suddenly—it started to move. It faded into the woods, disappearing.  There shouldn’t be anyone out here. And no human could scream like that.

I herded Dante inside, shut the door tight, and went back to work. I wanted to just leave but how could I with a broken vehicle. My hands moved but my mind wasn’t there. I flinched at every gust of wind. Every twig snap. I felt like a deer caught mid-freeze, knowing something was close but not knowing where it was. Or having the means to leave.

By the time the sun dipped behind the trees, I’d barely made a dent in the repair.

 

“Why does the sun have to go down to early in the winter?” I said frustratingly.

 I left the tools out and hurried back inside. I wanted no part of whatever might be moving through those woods after dark. I collapsed in bed. Held Dante close. We lay their anxiety driven for God knows how long until the stress put me to sleep.

I was awoken to another scream. But this one wasn’t a woman. It was a man. And it was right outside my window.

Dante tried to rise, but I held him down, with one hand wrapping around his snout to keep him quiet. I didn’t move. Not even to breathe. My eyes were locked on the wall as the sound of that scream clawed through the cabin.

Then the rumbling started.

The entire house shook. Floorboards creaked under invisible weight. And beneath the screams—layered like a sick symphony—came the sounds of other things.

A bear’s roar.

A deer’s bleat.

Another human voice. Then two. Then birds. A dog. A cat. All overlapping.

It was like the forest itself was emptying out its lungs. Like it was screaming back at something we couldn’t see.

Everything stopped.

Silence.

Then—

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

I froze. A soft knock on the glass. A whisper followed the silence like a breath from behind a door.

“Are you in there?”

 And then all of it—the noise, the shaking, the voices—slipped away into the woods, swallowed by whatever black pit it had come from.

I sat up. Stared at my rifle. My heart was racing. My skin felt cold. I grabbed it. Snatched up a flashlight, Locked Dante inside, and ran.

Outside, the night was thick with fog and snow falling. My boots hit the ground and instantly splashed into a mess of tracks. Hundreds. Thousands. Hooves. Paws. Bare feet.

Crawling prints. Drag marks. And handprints. Dozens of them.

Some with fingers too long. Some missing fingers altogether. Some bent in ways that made me gag. It was like something had slithered and clawed its way across the earth with no bones left in its body.

“Who the fuck crawls barefoot through the woods?” I whispered, my voice barely breaking the still air. Then the smell hit.

The rot.

Thick. Wet. Smothering. I could feel it in my lungs. Like breathing through a sewer drain. My eyes watered. I tried to follow the tracks. My flashlight flickered across claw marks in trees and churned-up mud. I dropped to my knees, sobbing. I couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“Please,” I whispered to no one. “God… please help me…” Then, from somewhere up in the canopy:

**“H-esss n-not… lisssten-ing…”**

A wet, broken voice. Like a puppet trying to sound human.

I snapped upright.

“WHO’S OUT THERE?!” I screamed.

**Tap Tap Tap**

I turned.

Nothing.

Then again—above.

**Tap Tap Tap**

I tilted my head back. And there it was. A hand. Too far up. Too long. Draped in shadow.

Tapping a tree trunk with different fingers like it was drumming.

Faster now.

**TapTapTap**

**TapTapTapTap**

**TapTapTapTapTap**

**TapTapTapTapTapTap**

My heart raced.

I stood Flabbergasted at what I was witnessing. Then I ran.

Branches lashed my face. Roots grabbed at my boots. I sprinted back to the cabin, gasping. Tripping. Nearly falling.

When I made it back, I ran toward the bedroom window—and stopped cold.

Right there in the center of the glass…A single muddy cat pawprint. Pressed dead center against the pane.

“Casper…” I whispered.

That’s when Dante’s face popped into view from the other side and scared the absolute shit out of me.

I rushed inside, Locked the door. Closed all the blinds tight and pushed to table against the door.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

I just sat in the bathroom holding Dante in the bathtub.

 

# GONE

 

The following morning, I made an uneasy trip back outside to the truck and finished repairs.

I turned my key and the engine made a few uncertain coughing sounds before vrooming back to life.

“THAT’S WHAT UP TALKING ABOUT BABY!” I said sticking my arm out the window and slapping the side of my truck.

“COME HERE BOY! LET’S GO BUY SOME FOOD!”

Dante made his way over and made an excited bark before leaping into the truck.

Hearing my truck run and finally having an escape. I felt overjoyed. I never made it to town quicker than I had just did. The school didn’t just peer into view like it usually does. It popped up in a flash. Like if you blinked you would miss its appearing.

“We are finally back Dante” I said with hope.

Dante matched my excitement.

“Let’s go see if Pete and Sarah are back before we grab some food”

It Looked like people had stopped putting up fliers. It gave me a little more hope. Maybe what’s going on here has passed. I really hope it did. The town was as silent and as empty as it was before, but I still held out hope.

A short drive later and Pete’s house came into view. Their vehicle was gone this time however.

I parked the truck and walked up to the door and knocked.

Silence.

I knocked again.

More silence.

I turned to walk away when I heard a voice. I couldn’t make out what they said, but there was a voice.

“Pete? Sarah” Is that you”

The voice played louder this time

“LEE?” The voice rang out.

I didn’t hesitate. I grabbed the doorknob and twisted. It was unlocked. I went inside.

“YES, ITS ME, WHERE ARE YOU!?” I called out

“THE BEDROOM!” the voice called back.

I could definitely tell it was female now that I could hear clearly.

“Is that you Sarah” I said as I spun the corner to the bedroom.

There in on the ground beside a bed lay the woman that I was expecting. She had large bruise across her forehead that traveled down the right side of her face and around her eye. She also had a cast on her right arm and leg.

“Thank God you’re here” she said with a cry

I stood shocked for a moment before I helped her up and asked, “What the hell happened to you and where is Pete?”

“I’ll tell you in a moment, but can you do me a favor” she asked. “I can’t really move. Can you help me to the bathroom. I’m also starving so if you don’t mind also…?

“Of course,” I said helping her up and leading her into the bathroom before going to the kitchen and grabbing some jerky.

I helped her back into her bed and handed her the jerky and some water.

“I really appreciate it Lee” she says “I don’t think I’ve eaten in a couple days”

“What the hell do you mean? Where is Pete and Why isn’t he here to help you? What the hell happened?”

“Three days ago. I think it was three. My head is so scrambled, and I’ve been sleeping a lot mostly cause of the medication, so it’s hard to remember. Pete and I were out running to get groceries. There is like a five-minute drive through winding roads. We were almost through the pass when out of nowhere. Something long. Outrageously long scrambled onto the road. It was dark out, so it was hard to tell. The only thing illuminating it was the cars headlights, and I only had a moment to look before…you know. I can only remember it was pink and red like gum or raw meat. Pete tried to swerve out of the way, but we still hit. It was my side of the vehicle that slammed. Whatever it was screamed so unnaturally loud before its thundering footsteps crashed back into the trees I blacked out after and next thing I knew I was awake in my bed at home.”

“That explains what happened to you” I approved. “But where is Pete? Whys isn’t he here helping you?

“We still needed food, and our car was out of commission. I think he decided to walk to Tommy’s to just grab anything to eat and drink. That was yesterday though, and he still hasn’t come back yet”

“Pete has been missing for day?! Why haven’t you told anyone?” I exclaimed

“It’s not like I can move. I’ve tried and you sall how far that got me. My phone is in the other room I think” She sobbed

I walked into the living room area and spotted her phone sitting on the coffee table and brought it to her.

She opened the phone and noticed one missed call from Pete and a message that read “stay inside and stay quiet”

I watched as she frantically tried to call Pete as it went straight to voicemail.

“Oh God Lee! I don’t know what to do” she said as tears began to flow down her face.

“I’ll bring as much food and water next to you as you need and I can run to Tommy’s to see if there is any trace of him” I told her “Just sit tight and I’ll be back.

“Please find him” she told me before going back into a sob.

I ran out of the house and spun my truck back Tommy’s way.

I pulled in and slammed the truck door behind me making Dante jump. Pulled hard on Tommy’s Door Making the bells ring loudly.

“TOMMY!” I yelled out.

Again, I yelled “TOMMY!”

Nothing.

“Tommy?!” I said again more worried this time.

Silence played out once again so I entered the store and started looking around. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The only thing I noticed was some boxes had fallen of the shelves and were laying on the ground. There was also a freezer door ajar casting a cold haze in his heated store.

I continued into the back of the store where Tommy keeps his stock. Immediately as I opened the door. A breeze slammed into my face. “What in God name?” I puzzled just before realizing the gust of air was coming from the ceiling.

A large hole. One the size of a car maybe. Was pushed inwards from the ceiling. Scratch marks littered the walls much like the claw marks left on the side of my cabin. On the edges of the mangled storage racks were chunks of fabric. It looked like someone was pulled upward from the bottom of the storage room toward the hole based on the direction it looked the fabric was yanked. There was no blood though. The idea of something this of this scale taking place and no one was injured was strange to me.

“What the fuck happened to Tommy?” I asked myself. But I knew.

Whatever had been haunting me in the woods was already half eating everything in Ashwood. I just returned to see it licking the crumbs off its plate.

I didn’t want to say it out loud but whatever happened to Tommy must have happened to Pete as well. Not just them. Every living creature in the surrounding area.

I jumped back in my Truck and raced back to Sarah.

I was frantic at this point. I needed to get back to Sarah and get her out of here before anything happened to her. If my friend was gone, I was going to make sure to get her out.

I pushed harder on the pedal going way over the speed limit. The thought never crossed me, however, because no one was around.

The house crept back into view, and I Leaped out of the truck. I didn’t want to leave Dante by himself, but I would only be a moment. And I walked back into the house and back to the bedroom.

“Lee, your back!” she said as excitedly as she could. “So where is Pete?”",1,1760845897.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I 28 F had been dating a 28 M who felt like he was on the exact same page as me. I’ve never in my life felt so connected or loved by another human. And yes there were flaws. Big ones. But why would I still take it over this heartache. I wasn’t always the happiest in the relationship and it was slowly getting worse. But I loved this man with my whole heart. And I can’t, for the life of me, let go of him. In the beginning, he did everything right. I felt so loved and safe and happy, the happiest I’ve ever been. He was so loving and romantic. He’d say all the right things. It felt like he spoke to my heart. Everything was amazing, the chemistry, the connection, the words, the sex, the safety, the love. It all felt so right. We moved quickly but it felt right. We both told each other that we’ve never felt this way before. That we both felt the “when you know you know” feeling. He made things officially after a couple of weeks and we were inseparable. I’d wake up to coffee on my night stand and walk out to either a flower or love note on my car door handle almost every morning. He was just so thoughtful and loving. He had the best attention to detail and noticed the smallest things like if I put a toner on my hair that made it slightly darker. He’d go above and beyond. He’d fix every problem I had, from car issues to apartment issues. He made me feel like the only girl in the world. He accommodated so many things for me from rearranging his room to have giant crates so my dogs could come over and cohabitate with his dog (who they didn’t get along very well with). He was such a fixer. He’d fix any and every problem that came up. I never in my life felt so attracted to someone on any and every level. But he had his flaws too. He had anger issues. He’d fly off the handle pretty easily but since I grew up with a father with similar issues, I felt I could handle it. Until it was personal. I often blame myself for our ultimate downfall and demise. One day he was complaining about work and how badly he wanted to have his own business but was scared to take the first step. Thinking I was encouraging and could be helpful in building an empire with him, I talked him into taking the first step. We filed his business name and immediately made a mistake with the filing. Knowing it wasn’t a huge deal, I told him we could amend it and everything would be fine. But to him it wasn’t fine. It was proof that he was going to fail. This was only the start to what would be a continuous spiral. He couldn’t let go of the fact that he already made a mistake and “couldn’t succeed in this” as this one little mistake was proof of that to him. His current boss also basically laid him off and said since he was planning to start his own business, he wanted to shut down the current operation that he was in charge of and kick him all the business instead. Which sounded like a pretty good deal. My ex could only focus on the negative and continued to spiral. I watched his mental health deteriorate over the next several weeks as so much doubt and negativity filled his mind. I told him if anyone could succeed at this, it would be him and I  was there every step of the way to help support him in any way I could. I ended up reaching out to my own resources, passed along advice from my colleagues who started their own businesses, and even made appointments for him with various people who came highly recommended. He still continued to focus on the negatives and lashed out at me, often telling me I wasn’t being helpful at all. He eventually became so cold and was no longer romantic or loving towards me. Suddenly all the sweet gestures and romance had come to complete stop. Chalking it up to him being stressed and under an isane amount of pressure, I stuck it out and allowed him to lash out at me. Eventually our fights became explosive, with him often pointing the finger at me and telling me that due to my reactions “my therapy clearly wasn’t working” so why would he ever consider therapy. He was negative and depressed all the time which made me so incredibly sad to see. I tried so hard to keep things afloat within our relationship, but the domino effect was in full force. Anytime I’d bring up that I felt things had changed between us, he’d get upset and tell me I was adding to his stress and ruining his peace. I felt so stuck. Trying not to rock the boat anymore, I bit my tongue and tried my best to mitigate any fights. He eventually decided to pick a fight about who I was following on instagram, of all things. Not wanting to fight,  I calmly said “just let me know who or what is bothering you, and I’ll remove it” he continued to harp on the fact that he shouldn’t even have to say anything. I calmly pointed out that he was in fact picking a fight and it didn’t need to be one considering I would do whatever he wanted me to do about it. He eventually got mad and told me to get the fuck out of his house. Having enough, I told him okay and started packing my things. He followed me and then told me if I left, it was over. I told him he asked me to leave and I was going to follow that request to which he then proceeded to get more angry and “helped” me pack my things. He said some pretty terrible things and was incredibly mean. I stuck to my guns and left and that was that. We talked a bit after and even had a moment where it seemed he wanted to work on things and talk through them so we’d be okay. He ended up stringing me along for a couple of days and I finally asked when he wanted to have this talk. He told me he wasn’t “chomping at the bit” for it to which I told him I didn’t feel like mending this was a priority to him. He agreed it wasnt and told me he can’t move forward with us as he has to put 100% of himself into this business. He told me he was so scared of failing and that he was already draining his savings and if we continued, and he failed at the business, he would never forgive himself for not focusing on his livelihood. We still had some communication on an off as I was struggling and he eventually accused me of posting him on “are we dating the same person” to which I flipped my lid obviously assuming he was cheating on me. Looking back, I don’t think he was as we were together nearly 24/7 and he had a jealous ex who was trying to get in between us during our relationship. But at the time, all I could think was that he had cheated which made me absolutely crazy. I said some pretty terrible things and told him to have the rest of my things ready to be picked up. He put them outside his house and wasn’t home when I did. He sent me a nice- ish text saying he washed my things, where they’d be, and that he was really sad things were ending on this note. I picked up my things and never responded. We don’t follow each other on social media but I can’t help but to check his profile even though it’s private. It’s been over a month and I can’t get over this man for the life of me. I know I have my faults, I wasn’t perfect and I’m to blame for some of this too but I just can’t shake this feeling of him being my person or the fact that we will never speak again. I know he also mistreated me as well and can clearly see the red flags I excused. I just cannot move on and have never in my life felt so heartbroken over a failed relationship. The worst part is, it was only four months and I feel so crazy for being so affected by such a short lived relationship, but I really can’t move on. Any advice on this situation?

1oafjgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1oafjgd/could_i_be_autistic/,Could I be autistic?,"Hi, I’m a 27-year-old woman and I suspect I might be on the autism spectrum, possibly level 1.
Here I’ll list some of the reasons I can remember right now. I’d like to know if anyone diagnosed with autism can relate to any of these. (I’ll be seeing a specialist soon.)

I’m 27, and although I finished school at 16, graduated from university at 22, and already have a master’s degree, I was only able to join the workforce about a year ago, thanks to psychological help. I’ve had many jobs, even some I dreamed of for years, but once I got them, I would quit within days because terrible anxiety took over. I felt trapped and just wanted to run away. I’m currently working, and even though my bosses are very kind and don’t pressure me, I constantly feel like they hate me and that I’m doing everything wrong. Working in person isn’t for me, so I hope to switch to remote soon.

Since childhood, I’ve always struggled to make friends. I was always the shy one who didn’t talk. Once, my entire class went to see a comedy movie at the cinema, and while everyone was laughing hysterically, I was the only one who didn’t laugh, and they teased me about it for years. But I won’t laugh if something doesn’t actually make me laugh.

People say I’m very honest and speak without thinking.

There are certain physical pains that I actually enjoy, they make me feel happy. Things like bee stings, vaccines, or ingrown nails. When I was little, I used to let bees sting me on purpose.

I don’t miss people much when they’re not around. If I go on a trip, I don’t really miss my parents. If my mother travels, I don’t tend to miss her either. When my brother left for a year, I didn’t miss him much, only when I realized I wasn’t missing him did I start thinking about him more.

I have a pacifier that I use when I’m very anxious.

I make small movements with my fingers when I’m stressed. I rub them together without realizing it.

At work, I find it very hard to express myself. If I need to tell my boss something, I might spend the entire day trying to do it and end up saying nothing until the very end, or even postpone it to the next day.

People sometimes say I seem cold. I greet people, but they still feel it’s not enough, they think I’m indifferent.

I can go weeks without leaving the house and it doesn’t bother me.

I like going out alone and being by myself. I don’t have friends because, as much as I enjoy solitude, I can’t really maintain friendships. I won’t text or meet often.

Coffee gives me a lot of anxiety.

Showering or brushing my teeth isn’t easy. I do it every day, but it’s not something I enjoy. I do it very quickly just to get it over with. If I put on clothes without showering first (even if I showered hours earlier), it feels uncomfortable, as if I can feel the clothes on my skin.

I can be stingy with my food and belongings. It’s hard for me to share, even though I do it.

I don’t really have any fixations. As a child, I loved reading and did it all the time, but since I was 16, I haven’t been able to enjoy it. No book hooks me anymore, and I can’t seem to find any hobby that truly interests me.

I’m not very social, and sometimes I have to act to fit in, talking, pretending to be interested, or laughing when I’d rather just stay quiet and serious for a while.

When tragedies happen, I often don’t feel sad. Sometimes I even feel a little excited because I want to see what’s going to happen.

There are many other things, but I can’t remember them all right now. Please give me some insight and let me know if you recognize any of these traits. Thank you so much.",5,1760844828.0,AutisticAdults,0,0.86,False

Part I – The Silence of Nome

The wind in Nome could sound like a living thing. It had moods, a kind of haunted breath that rattled the eaves of houses and slipped through the cracks of window frames no matter how much tape or caulk you used. Some nights it sighed like an old man remembering his sins. Other nights it howled like something wild and half-starved scratching at the door.

Evan Holt had learned to live with it, though he doubted he’d ever sleep easy through it again.

The storm had been moving in since late afternoon—thick, gray clouds rolling in low from the Bering Sea, swallowing the sky in heavy folds. He stood outside his cabin, tightening the straps on the fuel drums and checking the line of snowshoes on the porch. His breath came out white and quick. He didn’t like to think of himself as a man afraid of storms—he’d been in plenty—but the first real one of the season always got into his bones.

Winter was back. The one-year mark was close now.

He went inside before the cold could find its way under his coat. The cabin was small—just two rooms, both lined in spruce paneling, and warmed by a black iron stove that clicked and popped like it had a mind of its own. A single lamp lit the space, turning the frost on the windows into a pale, trembling gold.

Evan poured himself coffee, black as the sky outside. On the table sat a small stack of yellow envelopes, all addressed to the same name in the same neat, heavy handwriting: Marla Holt. None of them were stamped. None had ever been mailed. He wrote one every few days, though he never planned to send them.

He sat down, took out a pen, and began.

October 29th

You’d have liked the clouds tonight. They’re the kind that hang low, heavy with snow. I can feel it coming. The stove’s being temperamental again—guess you were right about me needing a new flue cap. I saw a fox near the old trap line yesterday. Pretty thing, red as your scarf. For a second, I thought it was you.

He stopped writing. His eyes drifted to the window. The last light was gone. The glass reflected only the lamp’s weak glow and his own face—unshaven, hollow around the eyes, the kind of look you get when you’ve been living with ghosts too long.

He didn’t hear the wind at first. Then it came: low and mournful, sweeping across the tundra. A long, distant cry. It wasn’t unusual, not really—Nome was full of noises that could trick the mind. But something in that sound made his stomach twist.

He stood and crossed to the window, pressing a hand against the cold glass. The night outside was white and endless, and for a moment, he thought he saw something moving against it. A flicker of shadow at the tree line, too tall for a fox, too slender for a bear. Then it was gone.

He waited another minute before turning back to the stove. The wind rose again, louder now, almost human.

He stoked the fire and sat back in his chair, watching the flames dance in the grate. He could hear the faint ticking of the wall clock, the steady drip of melting ice from the roof, and beyond that—the silence. Nome had a special kind of silence. It wasn’t peaceful. It was thick, pressing, the kind that made you aware of your own breathing.

He reached for his radio, flipped it on, and got nothing but static. The signal came and went this far out. The locals called it “the edge of the map,” though the truth was, Nome had always been off the edge of something—civilization, reason, maybe even the world itself.

When he finally went to bed, the wind was still crying around the eaves. He dreamed of her again.

⸻

They’d been together for twelve years. Married for eight.

Marla had been the brave one—outdoorsy, sharp-witted, a woman who laughed at the cold. She was a wildlife photographer, and every winter she’d drag him out into the wilderness with her, camera around her neck, snow up to her thighs, chasing shots of caribou and foxes.

The avalanche had taken her last December. It was supposed to be a simple trip—two snowmobiles, a ridge not far from Solomon Creek. He remembered the white curtain falling, the sound like thunder breaking right above them. He remembered screaming her name, digging until his fingers bled, but the snow kept coming.

They never found her. Not even her camera.

Sometimes, on the worst nights, he wished he’d been buried with her.

⸻

Morning came gray and hollow. Evan woke to the sound of something brushing the side of the cabin. He sat up fast, listening.

Scrape. Scrape.

He grabbed the rifle from beside the bed, thumbed the safety off, and moved quietly toward the door. The world outside was muffled under a foot of new snow. He stepped onto the porch, rifle raised. The cold air stung his lungs.

At first, he saw nothing. Then he noticed the marks along the wall—deep grooves running down the wood. Claw marks. Too long to be from a fox or lynx. He followed them a few feet, heart pounding, until he reached the corner of the cabin. There, half-buried in the snow, was something small and familiar.

A red wool glove.

He froze.

It was hers.

He picked it up, brushed the snow off. The wool was stiff with frost, but he’d know it anywhere—she’d worn it that last day.

A trick of the storm, he thought. Something washed up from the ridge, carried by wind or melt. But deep down, a part of him didn’t believe that.

He took the glove inside, set it on the table beside his letters. For the rest of the day, he couldn’t stop staring at it.

⸻

That night, the sound came again. Not the wind this time—something closer.

It began as a soft tapping against the door. Three times. Pause. Three again.

He stood frozen in the middle of the cabin, pulse roaring in his ears.

“Who’s there?” he called.

Silence.

Then, faintly—so faintly he thought he imagined it—came a voice.

“Evan.”

He dropped the coffee mug in his hand. It shattered across the floor.

The voice came again, softer. “Evan… it’s cold. Let me in.”

For a moment, he couldn’t move. His mind clawed for reason, for anything that made sense.

He stepped toward the door. “Marla?”

Nothing. Only the snow hissing against the window.

He threw open the door. The wind hit him like a knife. The porch was empty, white and silent.

He stood there for a long time, staring into the storm, until the cold burned his skin.

When he finally closed the door, something inside him had shifted—something small but vital. A hairline crack in the wall he’d built to keep himself sane.

That night he didn’t sleep.

⸻

By morning, the sky had cleared. The world outside glittered blue and sharp under the weak sunlight. He told himself it had been a dream—an echo of her voice, born from exhaustion and the wind. Nome did that to people. The dark months stretched long, and the mind started making ghosts out of snowdrifts.

Still, he checked the door for prints.

There were some. Not animal. Not boots. Bare feet.

Small.

Human.

Part II – The Things That Return

The footprints were still there the next morning.

Evan crouched over them, breath clouding in the brittle air. The snow around the porch was untouched except for those small, perfect depressions—bare feet, toes spread wide, sinking cleanly into the crust. There were maybe a dozen, leading from the tree line straight to his door and then back again.

He ran his gloved hand over one of them, half expecting it to crumble or melt under his touch like something imagined. But it stayed, real and solid, cold enough to bite through the glove.

Bare feet. Out here. In this cold.

He followed the trail a few yards before it vanished under a windblown drift. The sky was the color of steel, and the light had that particular dullness that came before more snow. In the distance, the tundra stretched on forever, the birch trees thin and silent, like bones pushing through white flesh.

He didn’t know why, but he whispered her name.
“Marla.”

Nothing answered him but the wind.

⸻

At the airfield that day, the world felt too normal, which somehow made it worse. The hangar smelled of oil and frost. The mechanics worked with slow, steady movements, bundled in flannel and heavy gloves. Evan tried to lose himself in the rhythm of repair—bolts, filters, hydraulic lines—but his mind wouldn’t settle.

“You hear about the lights again?” asked Neilson, the oldest of the lot, a man with a beard like gray moss and the voice of someone who’d smoked since before the world started turning. He leaned against the workbench, sipping coffee from a thermos. “Old Mary out near Anvil Creek says she saw ‘em two nights ago. Out past the ridge.”

“What lights?” Evan muttered, not looking up.

“Those blue ones,” Neilson said. “Like fire but wrong. They come before the snow really hits. Eskimo stories say it’s the hungry ones walking again.”

“The hungry ones?”

Neilson grinned, half toothless. “You’ve been here how long and nobody told you about the Wendigo?”

Evan snorted. “That’s Canadian myth, isn’t it?”

The old man shook his head. “Not just Canadian. Out here too. They say when someone dies bad—trapped, starving, left to freeze—the spirit gets twisted up. Comes back hollow. Wants to eat and can’t stop. Skin turns like ice, teeth like needles. Looks like the person you lost until you let it close.”

The younger mechanic laughed, but it died quick when Neilson didn’t join in.

“Thing is,” Neilson went on, “they can sound like people you love. They use your memories to pull you in. Once you look ‘em in the eye, you’re already half gone.”

Evan tightened the wrench until the bolt squealed. “Sounds like campfire bullshit.”

“Maybe.” Neilson’s voice dropped. “But I’ve seen tracks out there. Bare feet in the snow. No blood, no frostbite, just… walking.”

That made Evan pause.

He didn’t tell Neilson about what he’d found that morning. He didn’t tell anyone. But as he walked home that evening, the words kept repeating in his head.

Bare feet in the snow.

⸻

The next few days passed in a slow, sleepless fog. He wrote more letters but didn’t seal them. He ate only when the hunger forced him to. The glove stayed on the table beside the stack of envelopes, the wool stiffening as the heat from the stove dried it out.

Sometimes, he swore it moved.

He started noticing small things missing—his flashlight, one of his boots, a few cans of soup. Once, the back door was standing open when he came home. No sign of forced entry. Just footprints. Always the same kind: small, bare, human.

At night he heard the voice again. Softer now, coaxing.

“Ev… open the door. I’m here.”

The first time, he shouted back—told it to leave him alone. But the next night, when he heard it again, he sat in silence, trembling, afraid that answering might make it real.

He stopped sleeping by the third night.

⸻

It was the sheriff who brought up Marla again. Sheriff Liz Calloway—forty, sharp, pragmatic. They’d gone to high school together before Evan left for Anchorage and the short, unhappy years that followed. She’d been kind after Marla’s disappearance, checking in once or twice, though he always found excuses to avoid her.

This time, she showed up at his door.

“Morning, Holt,” she said, stamping the snow from her boots. “You mind if I come in? Storm’s building.”

He hesitated before nodding. She glanced around the cabin—at the pile of letters, the glove, the dishes in the sink—but said nothing.

“Got a call from up near Teller Road,” she said finally. “Couple of trappers found something strange. Thought you might want to know.”

He tensed. “What kind of strange?”

“Looks like part of a coat. Red. Torn to hell, frozen stiff. You want to guess what brand?”

He stared at her. “Columbia?”

She nodded. “Women’s size small.”

Marla’s size.

She placed something on the table—a small, cracked plastic button, the kind that fastens the hood on a winter jacket. The kind Marla had worn the day she vanished.

“Could’ve been caught in the thaw,” Liz said carefully. “Wind moves things around up there.”

“Could’ve been,” he said, though his voice sounded far away.

She studied him a moment. “You holding up okay, Ev?”

He didn’t answer. The stove popped, sending sparks into the room.

“Look,” she said. “If you’re seeing things again… hearing things… you can come talk to me. Winter does strange things to the mind out here.”

He forced a small smile. “I’m fine, Liz.”

She didn’t look convinced. But she nodded and left.

When the door shut, he turned the button over in his hands. It was cracked clean through, edges sharp as ice. He set it beside the glove.

The air in the cabin felt different after that—thicker somehow. The shadows didn’t sit right. He started to feel watched.

That night, he dreamed of the ridge again.

⸻

He was digging, hands bleeding, breath tearing out of him. The snow was coming down harder now, sheets of white suffocating the world. He found her parka, red against the white. He dug faster. He found her hand.

Her fingers were black with frostbite. Her nails were broken. She opened her eyes.

“Why’d you leave me?” she whispered.

He woke up screaming.

The room was cold. The fire had gone out. He lay still for a long time, staring at the ceiling.

Then he heard the breathing.

Soft, ragged, coming from the corner.

He turned his head slowly, and there, crouched by the stove, was a figure.

It was small, thin, covered in rags of white and red. Its head tilted at an impossible angle. Steam rose off its skin. He couldn’t see its face, only the long black hair hanging down in frozen strands.

“Marla,” he whispered.

It shuddered. The head twitched toward him, too fast, and he saw a glimpse of its face—white skin stretched tight over bone, eyes sunk deep and rimmed with frost, mouth torn wider than any human mouth should be.

It smiled.

Then it was gone.

He sat there until dawn, rifle across his knees, the shape of that smile burned into his mind.

⸻

The next day he drove into town, desperate to see another face. He found Neilson at the gas station, topping off his snowmobile.

“You look like hell,” Neilson said.

Evan tried to smile. “Been a rough week.”

The old man frowned. “You see the news? Those hunters up by Dexter? They found a couple reindeer gutted clean. Not eaten. Just torn up.”

Evan swallowed hard. “Animals do that sometimes.”

“Not like this.” Neilson looked him dead in the eye. “You think she’s still out there, don’t you?”

Evan didn’t answer. He climbed back into his truck and drove home before the snow started again.

By the time he reached the cabin, night was falling. He went to check the porch and froze.

There was something nailed to the door.

A strip of flesh. Pale, thin, with a line of hair attached.

He knew that hair.

It was auburn.

Marla’s color.

⸻

He burned it in the stove, but the smell lingered long after—sweet and rotten, like something dying in the walls. He tried to open the window, but the wind outside was howling again. Somewhere in the noise, he heard her voice.

“Ev… come with me.”

He pressed his hands over his ears, but it didn’t stop.

“Don’t you love me anymore?”

The question was so soft it almost broke him.

He found himself answering, without meaning to. “Yes.”

The whisper came again, closer now, just beyond the glass.

“Then open the door.”

⸻

The lamp flickered once and died. The room went black.

Outside, something scraped along the window. Slow. Deliberate. Fingernails.

He aimed the rifle toward the sound, heart hammering.

A shadow passed across the thin beam of the moonlight. He could see it more clearly now—tall, thin, moving on all fours, its limbs too long. The face pressed against the glass, pale and grinning, eyes like hollow pits.

It whispered again. “You left me in the dark.”

Then it was gone.

He didn’t sleep at all that night. When the first light came, he sat at the table, shaking, and began a new letter.

November 4th

If you’re out there, Marla, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to leave you. I tried to find you. God knows I tried. But you’re not her anymore, are you? You’re hungry. And you found me.

When he looked up, the glove was gone.

I have a decent small collection with some cute outfits that don’t see the light of day. Mainly for fear of losing one, the girls stay home. They need exposure to the public since I’ve chosen to homeschool them lol. We are locals to the theme parks in Florida and I’ve often seen babies clipped to others bags! So I couldn’t pass up matching with my backpack and venturing out for a day of rollercoasters and safely storing her. (She came front row for the Flight of the Hippogriff though!) Precautions were taken with double clipping her to two of my zipper tabs, taking her off in the tight crowds a few times, and storing in my bag for the locker to avoid scuffs. Overall no issues, it was worth the hassle, for sure. I’ll do it again but with the safety clasp thing. The sweetest teenager from Germany (I’m in my 30s) approached me and chatted about how she wants one so bad and complimented my Serenity’s outfit. She explained they are hard to get where she is at and very expensive! This is the second time a person visiting on vacation expressed love for my Bubu and their desire for one of their own. I really want to carry an extra baby on me to give to someone like that just because I love this community so much. I appreciate how it brings together strangers in a world where it feels like most people won’t even smile to acknowledge another human much less look up from their phones. Thank you to the Lovers of Labubus who make this community so dang awesome! Take your babies out and hopefully it brings you a kind interaction that makes you smile.

Hey, thanks for stopping by! Just putting myself out here to hopefully make some lasting friendships either locally or overseas. If you like reminiscing about the good old days, exchanging little nuggets from everyday life, and even sharing thoughts that won't be spoken out loud, read on! 

I'm from Australia, working full-time. I volunteer sometimes and spend the rest of my time cooking, reading, budgeting, contemplating life choices, and dealing with casual bouts of existential crisis. I've been on a dedicated health journey since 2017, and kind of proud of all the progress. I've learned, unlearned, relearned a lot on my own, and am always looking to deepen and expand my knowledge that I can practically apply. I don't smoke. I'd like to say that I don't do drugs either, but that'd be a non-truth considering the amount of coffee I drink before midday. I only occasionally drink alcohol but prefer avoiding it mostly. I recently rediscovered the joy of listening to audio books after a long pause. Personality wise, I'm typically a calm and collected guy. I'm not constantly seeking the next dopamine spike or adrenaline rush. I value balance, respect, peace, and sincerity.

If your interest is piqued by now, I'd love to read from you. Whether you are from Down Under or anywhere else on the globe, you are welcome to reach out. There are extra large value-added brownie points for you if you also use the Oxford comma as a rule 😉

now dont get me wrong, he isnt overtly dirty/gross. however i have a lot of sensory issues with breath and BO in general, im a daily flosser-water pick-mouthwash type and i shower daily and could never get behind the whole not washing hair daily thing. he often will not brush his teeth in the mornings or say that he will when he is done his coffee and then doesnt. similar with showering he will skip showering after work often and he works a high labor job which bothers me because of our bedsheets being dirtied. 

he doesnt have a dentist, and in my area we have a lack of services because we are extremely rural with 2 year waitlists for any office, so i do understand, but he doesnt make any effort to get one or get on said waitlists because theyre ""too long"". i try and reason with him that they wont get shorter and it doesnt hurt to be on it, but then he starts saying im hurting his feelings which i do believe. i dont want to keep pushing it or asking him to brush his teeth because it makes him insecure and he struggles with depression, but i know him well enough from seeing his ups and downs and his habits during each that he is currently functioning enough that he can brush his teeth. i also often ask him to do it with me to encourage it. he never brushes at night and it is awful, i believe he brushes once a day but not well and it is bad even after he brushes them. 

with showers he doesnt skip more than a day but i dont believe he washes some parts of his body properly due to body hair (mainly armpits) and he uses that shitty aluminum free deodorant. he does take care of himself just not consistently and i believe it is due to procrastination because he works many hours and will utilize his time for other things like his hobbies which i understand but i dont want him to have a thirty step routine like me due to my own issues, but i cant even stand to kiss him sometimes his breath is so bad, and when i talk to him it makes him feeling like im being mean. 

how do i talk to him about this without making him feel bad? i love him and dont want to hurt him, but its effecting my attraction towards him and as a result our relationship in general. i just want him to not get defensive but im not exactly mr communication expert either",1,1760844070.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

>***Late 20th century***

>*Styles of the late 20th century have largely been derived from the current world architectural trends, or have been imitative of previous Australian styles. These styles include Stripped Classical, Ecclesiastical, International, Organic, Sydney Regional,* ***Perth Regional****,\* Adelaide Regional, Tropical, Brutalist, Structural, Late Modern, Post Modern, Australian Nostalgic and Immigrants' Nostalgic. In the 1980s and 1990s, most parts of Australia had a building boom which strained building supplies, so many buildings from this era are characterised by cheap and low quality materials.*

\*(It doesn't cite/reference what 'Perth Regional' is)

Is the implication that styles from this period are too varied and derivative to be worth recording in detail?",1,1760843983.0,perth,3,0.6,False
1oaf9p2,https://i.redd.it/noe5ryu1lzvf1.png,10 cozy cafés in Shibuya that are perfect for a chill afternoon date or solo break ☕️🌿,"I spent a weekend café-hopping around Shibuya and found some amazing spots that go beyond the usual Starbucks or chain cafés.  
If you like minimalist interiors, desserts that actually taste good (not just look good), and chill vibes for a slow afternoon — these are worth checking out.

A few highlights from my list:

* **note** – black-themed minimalist café, great cakes and quiet atmosphere.
* **NEW LIGHT** – slightly dark, high-ceiling café with beautiful desserts.
* **347CAFE&LOUNGE** – outdoor terrace with a pool view, feels like a mini resort in the middle of Shibuya.
* **WHITE GLASS COFFEE** – surrounded by plants, calm music, their tiramisu is a must.
* **VALLEY PARK STAND** – on the rooftop of Miyashita Park, nice view and relaxing spot.

I made a list on ClippyMap called **“10 MUST TRY Cafes in Shibuya, Tokyo”**, where you can see all the spots on one map:

We met through sport. I’ve been trying to impress him in several ways as I really like him. Since earlier this year we’ve been on a couple of dates, and constantly messaging, admittedly its me initiating most of the conversations but anyways.

We have a bit of a rivalry with sport, as we both follow football closely, he’s a strong supporter of Team A, I’m a strong supporter of Team B, both teams are bitter rivals. Truth is, Team B (his team) are I concede the better team as they’ve almost always beat Team A in matches and commentary also more or less has the same vibe.
I might have gotten ahead of myself but the past few months while messaging him, I’ve taken digs at Team B, including saying “they’re pretty mediocre :P” ,  and saying “ew how cringe” when he sent me a video of the team hugging each other.   I thought it was fine as he never took digs at my team.

I didn’t think too highly on it but now I feel like he’s giving me the cold shoulder.

I’m now initiating the conversations 100% of the time. He will without fail take at least 24h to reply. And then the replies will always be closed-end replies like “yeah good thanks” if I ask how he is,  or when I said I might be around your workplace tomorrow (if you wanna catch up) and he goes “Cool! Enjoy your afternoon there”.   A few days ago I tried sending a meme to him of something we laughed about and had a good chat about on a previous chat, and it just got a laugh react and no further message. Yesterday I messaged again saying if he wants to get a coffee at the end of the month, 24h wait, and then he replies saying I might be busy, I will check my schedule closer to then like come onnnn…..

It’ll be completely peaceful — Max is lying on the floor, half asleep, looking like a perfect little angel. And then suddenly… BAM. He jumps up like he just remembered he’s late for an important meeting.

Out of nowhere, he’s sprinting around the house — full speed. Sofa to kitchen. Kitchen to bed. Bed to sofa again. Tail wagging, paws sliding, eyes wide like he just drank three cups of coffee.

He’ll grab a random toy, toss it in the air, bark at it, then run again — for absolutely no reason. I just stand there like, “Are you okay, bro?” but he’s already on his fifth lap.

And the best part? After all that chaos, he flops back down on the floor like nothing happened. Total silence. Like he didn’t just turn the living room into a racetrack.

Turns out he's addicted to opiates and I just found out he deals it too. I can't have that in my house.,"He got kicked out of his last place for reasons he didn't really get into. I know he's had addiction issues in the past and I care about him so I let him stay with me. I figured if I keep him off the streets there's a better chance he can get into treatment, which he says he wants to do. He's made very little effort to seek help. Went to maybe one AA type meeting in the month and a half since he's been here. I've done all the research and told him how to get in to detox and where. Trying to make it easier to get help in whatever way I can. 

I am very understanding and I know way more than I should about the drug and the lifestyle so I encouraged him to be honest with me because I understand withdrawal isn't fun and that's mostly why he keeps using. But my house looks like a bomb went off. Spilled juice, cereal, everything is sticky, his stuff is literally EVERYWHERE. I told him not to do drugs in my house. Go do it somewhere else and come back. I don't need a lit torch burning my house down. He has completely ignored that rule. I come home at least once a week from work to him passed out on my couch with pipes and baggies strewn about. He melted a hole in my couch. He passed out with a shitty glass pipe in his hand and it smashed everywhere. He didn't realize it and got up and cut his foot pretty bad. Blood and glass everywhere when I woke up to go to work. I had to clean it up because he was passed right out.

Then I found a scale, baggies, a coffee grinder with white dust in it, weird ice cube trays, bags of sugar they use for buff...

So he passes out with his phone unlocked and because I'm concerned for my safety (junkies showing up at my house but also cops smashing my door to SWAT him), I wanted to know what's up. He's not paying rent and I'm letting him stay because I care about him but FUCK NO NOT THIS. So I check his texts and hooooooly moley im finding texts from ""friends"" of his asking for drugs, him asking other people for drugs, all kinds of incriminating shit. 

I'm currently scared and I don't want him here at all. I tried to kick him out before. By saying it to his face. He just wouldnt leave. He left and went MIA for a while so I put his stuff outside with a note saying not to come back, get help, find another place to live (in the nicest way possible) and he just crawled in thru my window and put all his stuff back in my house. He has nowhere else to go (allegedly) so I feel like i have to move and not tell him where I'm going so he doesn't do this again. None of his family give two shits about him so I can't get him any support in that sense. 

I haven't slept much or ate because it's so stressful babysitting him. Hes already overdosed once. He was also arrested outside my front door and the cops said he was prowling the neighborhood trying doorknobs at random houses. He was released 24hrs later. Back to my house. 

if the landlord or upstairs tenants find out I dont want to get evicted because of him. I feel like I'm hugely at risk and my mental health was bad to begin with and this is making me suicidal. But my options seem to be 
1) put up with it
2) call the cops and he goes to jail for like 8 hours and then comes right back and breaks into my house again (my house is pathetically not secure but it's better than him breaking a window)
3) try to get him into treatment which he doesn't think he needs

And how would I dip out and move to another place without him knowing where I'm going if he LIVES HERE. And what if he won't leave when I do???

We're and interracial couple, I'm white, she's black.

We don't have kids. I am a truck driver working for a company who delivers overpriced coffee products, and due to the economy, tariffs, and other policies in the US, as well as policies my company is implementing that make it easier to fire drivers, it is very likely I will lose my job in the next 6 months or so. It's hard to find other jobs right now, and none of them pay what my current job does. My wife gets SSDI, and works part time cleaning, but I'm the primary earner. We do have a bit of savings to pull from, about $40,000 in total, and she can continue to receive benefits. We own a house that we just bought last year that we intend to rent out, or sell if we can't rent it.

Reasons we chose Paraguay:

-Easy residency process and path to citizenship within 5 years. 
-Culture and language should be easier to adapt to than those in Asia. I used to speak Spanish years ago, it should be easy to pick up again. 
-Cost of living is insanely cheap. With our savings we would be good for a few years there, or would even have enough to start a small local business if we wanted to. 
-Stability, in the sense that things are always changing rapidly in the US, and that's unlikely to be the case in the same way in Paraguay. From what I've been able to gather, things stay pretty much the same. We can reasonably assume that unusually high tariffs won't dramatically increase the cost of goods overnight. 
-Food quality. It's incredibly expensive to get good quality food in the US, and much cheaper in Paraguay.

I see it as a bit of a risk, but I think it's less risky than staying in the US given the political climate, the economy, and our own situation. Her family thinks it's a smart decision. My family mostly disagrees.

I type the letter out and use some cursive looking font. Print it. Rip the edges. Crumple it a bit. Put it into a metal tray and either, dab it with a freshly used tea bag that had some brown colored tea, or, bust open a freshly used K-Cup from the coffee machine and dump the rounds into the tray with the letter.

In the case of coffee grounds I add a bit more water and smear the coffee grounds around on both sides of the letter with a thicker napkin.

In case of the tea bag I add a bit more water and sort of let the letter soak a bit. Not a lot of water mind you, have to watch for tears.

Then I pop the entire metal try into the toaster and set it to bake for about 2 minutes.

That will usually get the dry and crispy. Then I'll hang it up for a while until it is totally dry, brush off any clingy coffee grounds, and all done.

A few times I used those laminating sheets on them to preserve them, but I think I'm over that. Chances are I will only use these once per PC group, ever, so if I get lucky that's what, like twice, maybe three times I would run the same adventure? If they get totally worn out I'll just remake them. More realistically though, the more worn out they look the better.

Bone-chilling, brain freezing temperatures encased my rapidly descending self while bubbles of white and blue and rainbows glimmered all around me. Voice crying out, the sound was swallowed by the all encompassing void that was my presumed tomb of the past. Limbs straining against the still flow that threatened to consume me, the tranquility of the scenery was only broken by a loud splash following my futile resistance.  

Eyes shut tight, small puffy jacket clinging to my skin like Velcro, I remorse the lack of life jacket I had elected to leave on the vessel above me. The feeling of stinging cold rushes through my lungs as I'm forced to take my first small, shuddering breath of the strength-sapping atmosphere seeping into me slowly. All at once the panic fully set in as something warm brushed one of my minute arms. Struggling against the sudden resistance to my flailing, I lashed out with all my frail body held as the invader clung to me tight, kicking with all its might but missing me wholly. I clawed at the appendages restricting my movement until my face broke the surface of the icy cold lake I was held underneath. Blinking the water and icicles out of my lashes with chattering teeth, my eyes locked onto my mother's own pearlescent orbs. 

The full weight of a full grown soaking individual and their smaller soaked counterpart was heaved from the lake with every ounce of strength my father could muster. My mother and I landed in a heap atop him as the air chilled our liquid coating even further.  While she began compressions on my younger self my father busied himself with the engine of the little fishing boat. Pushing the engine as much as he possibly could while my frame was wrapped in anything dry they could scavenge from the boat. While the distance to the shore wasn't far, it seemed an eternity before we ran aground and our collective huddled together to scuttle inside the warm cabin den. 

My grandma was startled when we busted the door open and poured in, taking my little brother from my grandpa as he moved to help. With quickly produced blankets and towels, we were bundled up in minutes while we rubbed our extremities free of their lingering numbness. My father and grandpa went out on the porch to talk and drink from a fresh pot of coffee they'd already had going, as Grandma started heating up some warm apple cider for us to nurse on. Just when I'd just been handed a cup carefully, hands still shaking, the men's voices rose in fervor outside the heavy wooden door, emotions flaring but obscured when Grandpa slammed it open and walked to the back of the house furiously. 

\*\*\*

I must have hit my head on something when I jumped, if the throbbing pain emanating from my head was any indication. Dull pain being my first hint that I was still alive somehow woke me, as well as the frayed knot still holding my sanity together in this subterranean wasteland. Easing my eyelids apart I came to a second realization with a mild bit of panic at the unexpected resistance to my innocuous actions. They were coated in a familiar viscosity that I wiped away to clear my vision somewhat, finding the rest of my body in much the same state. I stripped my outermost layer of clothing, using what I can to clean away as much as possible from my face. 

Finally taking in my poorly lit surroundings I was met with a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my view. Stepping closer cautiously and finding solid ground ahead, I pull myself from the small pool I awoke laying in. As I close in my foot hits something solid and I'm practically ecstatic to find the flashlight pressed against my boot. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave the device some percussive maintenance with a few solid thwacks, and it flickered to life after the fourth or fifth swing. Thank fuck for DeWalt. 

With my current dwelling finally illuminated, the giddiness at the recovered tool is caught in my throat when the small hills I was creeping towards revealed themselves to be piles of bones from animals of all kinds. To my horror there seemed to be human remains dotted amongst the decay, the larger pieces still intact among the shattered bits of multiple skeletons. At the base of each was a large puddle of the same goop that still clung to myself, cracked green fragments laying in scattered patterns throughout the entirety of the room. 

As my breathing slowed and I inched my way back to the water and scanned for any more supplies that might've washed up with me, the only sound for a while was the dripping of water and my own steps while I wade through the shallow waters. To my luck I'm able to find the small shovel I'd brought down alongside a water bottle that was floating slowly in circles. Taking a small sip and reorienting myself with my current equipment, my next step was checking around for any other way out that didn't involve swimming. This meant getting closer to the rot, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the smell. 

Making a slow circle around the potential threat the piles presented, the lack of any change to the terrain gave me a slight sense of calm before I made it all the way to where I'd started the scoping out. With nothing to note on the walls or ceiling in regards to potential escape routes, I steel myself and start sorting through the closest gathering of ground up gore. The bones had been picked clean from what I could gather, and a slow rhythmic clattering began to rebound around the room as I sifted through. Closer to the base of the pile I found the viscera painted with a hardened layer of the cavern's coating, bits of that green glass like material stuck tight with their jagged edges facing outwards. 

As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I had the fortune of finding several discarded odds and ends from whatever was dumped down here. There were mainly scraps of fabric and bundles of fur that were left to the wayside, but I was able to scrounge together a shirt that was mostly intact from the mess. When I moved from my initially sorted piles to the next unfiltered stack, there was a brief moment of clarity while sound ceased. At least from myself. The slow clattering continues unabated, albeit unaccompanied by my own. As I freeze I see the bones of places aside, shivering some as a new presence threatens to burst free. Backing towards the water with my eyes locked on the movement, I hear a whir pitch up behind my hearing aids that echoes shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle. 

From within and almost melding into the bones surrounding them were pale and wriggling forms, worming their way free from their calcium covered enclosures. Moving in the same manner as a caterpillar, I saw dozens of them creep from where I'd just been kneeled down. As each wave appeared they joined the chorus ringing the space, waving heads pointed straight up, as if in prayer. With their front ends exposed, I saw in the rippling light refracted from the water the gaping maws of razor sharp rows each minute monstrosity held aloft. To my shock I saw a bevy of the same beings begin a similar set of procedures in the rest of the wretched refuse. Each mass shuddering and collapsing as dozens upon dozens of these creatures made themselves known to the world with shrieking cries. 

As I dropped to my knees and clawed at the sides of my face, I resisted every urge to rip out whatever semblance of mechanical assistance my ears possessed. Instead choosing to grab the flashlight and shovel in fear as I clambered backwards slowly before a splash broke my fevered concentration. I glanced behind me suddenly before whipping back around, hesitant to turn my attention from the frenzy unfolding. In that short moment however, I saw the mass of aquatic life I'd experienced previously working up to a flurry in the frothing pond. Taken aback by the sight, I halted my motion and focused on my current predicament above the wake. The creatures unleashing a torrid soprano that made my head spin all at once ceased any influence on me as the room fell to a standstill. 

Regaining my composure as the individual entities continued their upright posterity, it was multiple breaths before the sound of dragging arose, moving steadily closer to our current holdings. Taking the chance to click my flashlight off, I crouched down in a feeble attempt at concealing my presence. When my knee hit the ground finally, a form was dragged and eventually dropped upon the crowd of expectant invertebrates from the hazy covering above. Flinching at the impact of flesh on stone from a decent height, I braced myself before shining the light's sparse remaining battery towards the source of the deposit. When the ambient light illuminated my surroundings however, reflecting directly off of the studded and sparkled roof, I saw the crippled form of my father. 

Huddled together and missing one leg of his work jeans, although the rest of his clothes looked to be in a better state than mine. Displaying itself as I moved closer, still cautious of the frozen spawn surrounding us, most of his figure was conservatively stuck tight with only a handful of the same green spheres I'd seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. Not knowing his state of “aliveness,” I inched forward before the realization that the spheres looked even more familiar than initial inspection yielded. My foot brushing against something and causing a tinkling sound to ring out in the silence, I look down and see a shard. A green shard. 

My thoughts hit like a literal and metaphorical train as the end in one conclusion. Move. All stealth abandoned, I rush to my Pa’s side and check his pulse like health class taught. With a slow thrum I confirmed his continued existence, before taking my hands and shredding the bits of his uniform that were too stuck to the sickly pearls to extract. When my work was done, and the creatures around us stiff as ever, all that remained was a single external tumor on his right leg. His jeans remained as intact as I'd found him for the most part, and his over shirt had been completely coated, leaving behind a gray tank top beneath untouched. As I heaved his mostly free body to the side of the cave, one lone piece of bone separated itself from the rest, and fell to the floor. 

Raising my head at the sharp intrusion to the shuffling silence, I came to the conclusion I wasn't the only one drawn to the sudden noise. Each of the malformed, limbless things had ceased its unholy prayers, and turned their attention fully to the single bone that fell. While my breath hitched in my throat, I slowed my movement to a crawl, sliding off myself and my father against the ground seemingly not enough to alert them yet. When the movement of another of the worms caused a small avalanche of cream colored calcium, the monsters all together darted for the deluge. Twisting and engulfing any part of their presumed postmortem prey, the bundle grew in layers and size as they slid and intertwined with one another. Ideas and doubts racing through my mind, I picked a piece of what looked like a femur up from near my knelt down position, and tossed it towards the water amidst the feeding ball currently occuring. 

I was never good at any sports with a ball involved really, but this worked in my favor in this instance, as the piece landed short of the water by a few inches. Barely touching the waves ebbing to and fro from the scales bodies concealed beneath, the bone skittered to a stop with a slight ripple and splash. The ground based life forms took a moment to consult the validity of this new sound, before moving en masse and roiling around the new stimuli provided. As some slagged off of the main mass, the few unlucky enough to land in the liquid layer were quickly snatched and fought over by what gluttonous horrors awaited below the surface. 

Seeing the first light of hope, or maybe in my delusion the first action I felt confident enough to take given the bizarre situation, I rose carefully and braced myself against the wall while I gripped the handle of the shovel still strapped to my ragged leather belt. Placing my weight from the heels of my feet to the balls, I rocked my way as near as I could to the active empty buffet before me. Standing at attention within an arms length of the imminent danger, I eased the shovel from its bindings, eliciting a metallic -dink as it clashed against my belt buckle.

Loosing the tool fully, I cocked my shoulders back and bent my knees in my best imitation of a golfer's stance. 

Slicing downward with all my might, I twisted my body up as the blade of the implement met solid flesh with a veritable slosh. Many of the cretins were damaged by the initial blow, but any that survived to some degree careened lopsidedly towards the far wall. The volleyball of veinless forms collided with rock hewn from the most solid of sediments, spewing parts of itself in a short circumference before collapsing into the water below. Residue from my actions made its home on the wall and shovel I held with dull purple murk.

About 12 years ago, I fell into the world of tax sales, those county auctions where unpaid property taxes turn into opportunities for whoever’s willing to dig through messy records and deals with red tape. 

My first big win was a rundown house off highway 180; western New Mexico in a small college town. Everyone thought I was nuts for bidding on it. The roof had collapsed, the lot was overgrown, total eyesore. I bought it for about 7K, spent a few grand clearing title and demoing it, and ended up selling the lot to a Southwest coffee chain for just over six figures. That deal changed how I looked at ugly opportunities. 

Over the years, I kept meeting people curious about the space, RE investors, side hustlers, and blue collar individuals, all saying the same thing: why doesn’t anyone talk about this? 

So this year I started building a small business around it. It’s part media, part education, a way to share stories, data, and lessons from tax sales trenches. Im writing about both the wins and the screw-ups because, honestly that’s where the real learning happens. 

Im curious how others here have turned obscure expertise into something scalable.

Sorry guys I’m trying to write this fast** 
New account because my boyfriend in on my main Reddit. My bf and I have been together for over a year and have known each other for over 5 years. For context: at the beginning of our relationship, I had a male friend and my bf told me that he liked me and was a “weirdo” but I didn’t believe him. I don’t know why other than the fact that I try to see the good in people and I really didn’t see it until something happened that told both of us plainly that he has a thing for me. It took months for all of that to happen though and I know and understand why that caused trust issues for him. 

Today when he was leaving for work I just said jokingly “don’t let any girls flirt with you” because the past week he’s been hit on like 3 times and I was just joking around. We are both usually pretty secure about jokes like that, we know neither one of us are controlling or anything. He then said for me to do the same and I said “well nobody ever flirts with me so you have nothing to worry about.” And he replied with “it’s good that nobody flirts with you” and my smile immediately faded. I was hurt because I was trying to think of the last time someone flirted with me and I couldn’t even remember the last time HE flirted with me and it made me feel like I’m not pretty enough to be flirted with and that he’s glad I’m not pretty and get flirted with.. I know that me not getting flirted with by random men doesn’t mean I’m not pretty. But my own boyfriend hadn’t flirted with me since the very beginning of our relationship. I don’t feel very desired because he never tries to be intimate with me unless we’re in bed or just kisses or he literally shoves his tongue down my throat and I don’t like that. He probably doesn’t try because I say no often because I have pelvic dysfunction but I’m in pain.. so I feel like that shouldn’t stop his frequency of trying to be intimate especially if he finds me beautiful and desirable. 

I told him that I only got upset bc it made me realize how unattractive I felt not because I need validation from other men. Does anybody understand where I’m coming from or am I legitimately crazy? I went to therapy for over a year and I think I know how to communicate effectively but I lost my therapist because of a license and school policy issues last week and I’ve felt more vulnerable and reactive because of that. 

EDIT: Had to add this for context: 

I got upset visually on my face for like 2.5 seconds and the conversation didn’t go any deeper in person. He acted like everything was fine (which to me it was bc I just was upset for a split second) I didn’t even say I was upset by the comment. He waited until I was walking away from his work, because we rode together this morning and I walked to a coffee shop after, to text me that me getting upset made him feel a type of way like I need other men’s flirtatious remarks to feel pretty and just assuming that’s why my face looked the way it did when he said that. And I then told him that isn’t where my mind went at all but he refused to believe that I was upset for the reason I said and just thinks I want other men to flirt with me. I’m asking does it not make sense for me to feel the way I do based on everything I said in this post? Or is that a completely unbelievable reason why I would be upset at the comment? It doesn’t matter who’s right or wrong, I just want to know if anyone else can possibly understand where I’m coming from and maybe help me figure out a way to say it in a way he can understand so he doesn’t have this idea that I want other men’s attention. If this makes no sense to anybody on Reddit, I’ll know that something’s wrong but I need to know if I’m making sense before I attempt to ask him to understand me. 

TL;DR: Me (24f) and my boyfriend (24m) got into a fight because of my reaction to him saying “it’s good that nobody flirts with you” and I don’t know if my reaction was valid or if I’m just crazy.

Bone-chilling, brain freezing temperatures encased my rapidly descending self while bubbles of white and blue and rainbows glimmered all around me. Voice crying out, the sound was swallowed by the all encompassing void that was my presumed tomb of the past. Limbs straining against the still flow that threatened to consume me, the tranquility of the scenery was only broken by a loud splash following my futile resistance.  

Eyes shut tight, small puffy jacket clinging to my skin like Velcro, I remorse the lack of life jacket I had elected to leave on the vessel above me. The feeling of stinging cold rushes through my lungs as I'm forced to take my first small, shuddering breath of the strength-sapping atmosphere seeping into me slowly. All at once the panic fully set in as something warm brushed one of my minute arms. Struggling against the sudden resistance to my flailing, I lashed out with all my frail body held as the invader clung to me tight, kicking with all its might but missing me wholly. I clawed at the appendages restricting my movement until my face broke the surface of the icy cold lake I was held underneath. Blinking the water and icicles out of my lashes with chattering teeth, my eyes locked onto my mother's own pearlescent orbs. 

The full weight of a full grown soaking individual and their smaller soaked counterpart was heaved from the lake with every ounce of strength my father could muster. My mother and I landed in a heap atop him as the air chilled our liquid coating even further.  While she began compressions on my younger self my father busied himself with the engine of the little fishing boat. Pushing the engine as much as he possibly could while my frame was wrapped in anything dry they could scavenge from the boat. While the distance to the shore wasn't far, it seemed an eternity before we ran aground and our collective huddled together to scuttle inside the warm cabin den. 

My grandma was startled when we busted the door open and poured in, taking my little brother from my grandpa as he moved to help. With quickly produced blankets and towels, we were bundled up in minutes while we rubbed our extremities free of their lingering numbness. My father and grandpa went out on the porch to talk and drink from a fresh pot of coffee they'd already had going, as Grandma started heating up some warm apple cider for us to nurse on. Just when I'd just been handed a cup carefully, hands still shaking, the men's voices rose in fervor outside the heavy wooden door, emotions flaring but obscured when Grandpa slammed it open and walked to the back of the house furiously. 

\*\*\*

I must have hit my head on something when I jumped, if the throbbing pain emanating from my head was any indication. Dull pain being my first hint that I was still alive somehow woke me, as well as the frayed knot still holding my sanity together in this subterranean wasteland. Easing my eyelids apart I came to a second realization with a mild bit of panic at the unexpected resistance to my innocuous actions. They were coated in a familiar viscosity that I wiped away to clear my vision somewhat, finding the rest of my body in much the same state. I stripped my outermost layer of clothing, using what I can to clean away as much as possible from my face. 

Finally taking in my poorly lit surroundings I was met with a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my view. Stepping closer cautiously and finding solid ground ahead, I pull myself from the small pool I awoke laying in. As I close in my foot hits something solid and I'm practically ecstatic to find the flashlight pressed against my boot. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave the device some percussive maintenance with a few solid thwacks, and it flickered to life after the fourth or fifth swing. Thank fuck for DeWalt. 

With my current dwelling finally illuminated, the giddiness at the recovered tool is caught in my throat when the small hills I was creeping towards revealed themselves to be piles of bones from animals of all kinds. To my horror there seemed to be human remains dotted amongst the decay, the larger pieces still intact among the shattered bits of multiple skeletons. At the base of each was a large puddle of the same goop that still clung to myself, cracked green fragments laying in scattered patterns throughout the entirety of the room. 

As my breathing slowed and I inched my way back to the water and scanned for any more supplies that might've washed up with me, the only sound for a while was the dripping of water and my own steps while I wade through the shallow waters. To my luck I'm able to find the small shovel I'd brought down alongside a water bottle that was floating slowly in circles. Taking a small sip and reorienting myself with my current equipment, my next step was checking around for any other way out that didn't involve swimming. This meant getting closer to the rot, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the smell. 

Making a slow circle around the potential threat the piles presented, the lack of any change to the terrain gave me a slight sense of calm before I made it all the way to where I'd started the scoping out. With nothing to note on the walls or ceiling in regards to potential escape routes, I steel myself and start sorting through the closest gathering of ground up gore. The bones had been picked clean from what I could gather, and a slow rhythmic clattering began to rebound around the room as I sifted through. Closer to the base of the pile I found the viscera painted with a hardened layer of the cavern's coating, bits of that green glass like material stuck tight with their jagged edges facing outwards. 

As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I had the fortune of finding several discarded odds and ends from whatever was dumped down here. There were mainly scraps of fabric and bundles of fur that were left to the wayside, but I was able to scrounge together a shirt that was mostly intact from the mess. When I moved from my initially sorted piles to the next unfiltered stack, there was a brief moment of clarity while sound ceased. At least from myself. The slow clattering continues unabated, albeit unaccompanied by my own. As I freeze I see the bones of places aside, shivering some as a new presence threatens to burst free. Backing towards the water with my eyes locked on the movement, I hear a whir pitch up behind my hearing aids that echoes shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle. 

From within and almost melding into the bones surrounding them were pale and wriggling forms, worming their way free from their calcium covered enclosures. Moving in the same manner as a caterpillar, I saw dozens of them creep from where I'd just been kneeled down. As each wave appeared they joined the chorus ringing the space, waving heads pointed straight up, as if in prayer. With their front ends exposed, I saw in the rippling light refracted from the water the gaping maws of razor sharp rows each minute monstrosity held aloft. To my shock I saw a bevy of the same beings begin a similar set of procedures in the rest of the wretched refuse. Each mass shuddering and collapsing as dozens upon dozens of these creatures made themselves known to the world with shrieking cries. 

As I dropped to my knees and clawed at the sides of my face, I resisted every urge to rip out whatever semblance of mechanical assistance my ears possessed. Instead choosing to grab the flashlight and shovel in fear as I clambered backwards slowly before a splash broke my fevered concentration. I glanced behind me suddenly before whipping back around, hesitant to turn my attention from the frenzy unfolding.

Flinching at the impact of flesh on stone from a decent height, I braced myself before shining the light's sparse remaining battery towards the source of the deposit. When the ambient light illuminated my surroundings however, reflecting directly off of the studded and sparkled roof, I saw the crippled form of my father. 

Huddled together and missing one leg of his work jeans, although the rest of his clothes looked to be in a better state than mine. Displaying itself as I moved closer, still cautious of the frozen spawn surrounding us, most of his figure was conservatively stuck tight with only a handful of the same green spheres I'd seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. Not knowing his state of “aliveness,” I inched forward before the realization that the spheres looked even more familiar than initial inspection yielded. My foot brushing against something and causing a tinkling sound to ring out in the silence, I look down and see a shard. A green shard. 

My thoughts hit like a literal and metaphorical train as the end in one conclusion. Move. All stealth abandoned, I rush to my Pa’s side and check his pulse like health class taught.

I was never good at any sports with a ball involved really, but this worked in my favor in this instance, as the piece landed short of the water by a few inches.

Voice crying out, the sound was swallowed by the all encompassing void that was my presumed tomb of the past. Limbs straining against the still flow that threatened to consume me, the tranquility of the scenery was only broken by a loud splash following my futile resistance.  



Eyes shut tight, small puffy jacket clinging to my skin like Velcro, I remorse the lack of life jacket I had elected to leave on the vessel above me. The feeling of stinging cold rushes through my lungs as I'm forced to take my first small, shuddering breath of the strength-sapping atmosphere seeping into me slowly. All at once the panic fully set in as something warm brushed one of my minute arms. Struggling against the sudden resistance to my flailing, I lashed out with all my frail body held as the invader clung to me tight, kicking with all its might but missing me wholly. I clawed at the appendages restricting my movement until my face broke the surface of the icy cold lake I was held underneath. Blinking the water and icicles out of my lashes with chattering teeth, my eyes locked onto my mother's own pearlescent orbs. 



The full weight of a full grown soaking individual and their smaller soaked counterpart was heaved from the lake with every ounce of strength my father could muster. My mother and I landed in a heap atop him as the air chilled our liquid coating even further.  While she began compressions on my younger self my father busied himself with the engine of the little fishing boat. Pushing the engine as much as he possibly could while my frame was wrapped in anything dry they could scavenge from the boat. While the distance to the shore wasn't far, it seemed an eternity before we ran aground and our collective huddled together to scuttle inside the warm cabin den. 



My grandma was startled when we busted the door open and poured in, taking my little brother from my grandpa as he moved to help. With quickly produced blankets and towels, we were bundled up in minutes while we rubbed our extremities free of their lingering numbness. My father and grandpa went out on the porch to talk and drink from a fresh pot of coffee they'd already had going, as Grandma started heating up some warm apple cider for us to nurse on. Just when I'd just been handed a cup carefully, hands still shaking, the men's voices rose in fervor outside the heavy wooden door, emotions flaring but obscured when Grandpa slammed it open and walked to the back of the house furiously. 



\*\*\*



I must have hit my head on something when I jumped, if the throbbing pain emanating from my head was any indication. Dull pain being my first hint that I was still alive somehow woke me, as well as the frayed knot still holding my sanity together in this subterranean wasteland. Easing my eyelids apart I came to a second realization with a mild bit of panic at the unexpected resistance to my innocuous actions. They were coated in a familiar viscosity that I wiped away to clear my vision somewhat, finding the rest of my body in much the same state. I stripped my outermost layer of clothing, using what I can to clean away as much as possible from my face. 



Finally taking in my poorly lit surroundings I was met with a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my view. Stepping closer cautiously and finding solid ground ahead, I pull myself from the small pool I awoke laying in. As I close in my foot hits something solid and I'm practically ecstatic to find the flashlight pressed against my boot. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave the device some percussive maintenance with a few solid thwacks, and it flickered to life after the fourth or fifth swing. Thank fuck for DeWalt. 



With my current dwelling finally illuminated, the giddiness at the recovered tool is caught in my throat when the small hills I was creeping towards revealed themselves to be piles of bones from animals of all kinds. To my horror there seemed to be human remains dotted amongst the decay, the larger pieces still intact among the shattered bits of multiple skeletons. At the base of each was a large puddle of the same goop that still clung to myself, cracked green fragments laying in scattered patterns throughout the entirety of the room. 



As my breathing slowed and I inched my way back to the water and scanned for any more supplies that might've washed up with me, the only sound for a while was the dripping of water and my own steps while I wade through the shallow waters. To my luck I'm able to find the small shovel I'd brought down alongside a water bottle that was floating slowly in circles. Taking a small sip and reorienting myself with my current equipment, my next step was checking around for any other way out that didn't involve swimming. This meant getting closer to the rot, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the smell. 



Making a slow circle around the potential threat the piles presented, the lack of any change to the terrain gave me a slight sense of calm before I made it all the way to where I'd started the scoping out. With nothing to note on the walls or ceiling in regards to potential escape routes, I steel myself and start sorting through the closest gathering of ground up gore. The bones had been picked clean from what I could gather, and a slow rhythmic clattering began to rebound around the room as I sifted through. Closer to the base of the pile I found the viscera painted with a hardened layer of the cavern's coating, bits of that green glass like material stuck tight with their jagged edges facing outwards. 



As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I had the fortune of finding several discarded odds and ends from whatever was dumped down here. There were mainly scraps of fabric and bundles of fur that were left to the wayside, but I was able to scrounge together a shirt that was mostly intact from the mess. When I moved from my initially sorted piles to the next unfiltered stack, there was a brief moment of clarity while sound ceased. At least from myself. The slow clattering continues unabated, albeit unaccompanied by my own. As I freeze I see the bones of places aside, shivering some as a new presence threatens to burst free. Backing towards the water with my eyes locked on the movement, I hear a whir pitch up behind my hearing aids that echoes shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle. 



From within and almost melding into the bones surrounding them were pale and wriggling forms, worming their way free from their calcium covered enclosures. Moving in the same manner as a caterpillar, I saw dozens of them creep from where I'd just been kneeled down. As each wave appeared they joined the chorus ringing the space, waving heads pointed straight up, as if in prayer. With their front ends exposed, I saw in the rippling light refracted from the water the gaping maws of razor sharp rows each minute monstrosity held aloft. To my shock I saw a bevy of the same beings begin a similar set of procedures in the rest of the wretched refuse. Each mass shuddering and collapsing as dozens upon dozens of these creatures made themselves known to the world with shrieking cries. 



As I dropped to my knees and clawed at the sides of my face, I resisted every urge to rip out whatever semblance of mechanical assistance my ears possessed. Instead choosing to grab the flashlight and shovel in fear as I clambered backwards slowly before a splash broke my fevered concentration. I glanced behind me suddenly before whipping back around, hesitant to turn my attention from the frenzy unfolding. In that short moment however, I saw the mass of aquatic life I'd experienced previously working up to a flurry in the frothing pond. Taken aback by the sight, I halted my motion and focused on my current predicament above the wake. The creatures unleashing a torrid soprano that made my head spin all at once ceased any influence on me as the room fell to a standstill. 



Regaining my composure as the individual entities continued their upright posterity, it was multiple breaths before the sound of dragging arose, moving steadily closer to our current holdings. Taking the chance to click my flashlight off, I crouched down in a feeble attempt at concealing my presence. When my knee hit the ground finally, a form was dragged and eventually dropped upon the crowd of expectant invertebrates from the hazy covering above. Flinching at the impact of flesh on stone from a decent height, I braced myself before shining the light's sparse remaining battery towards the source of the deposit. When the ambient light illuminated my surroundings however, reflecting directly off of the studded and sparkled roof, I saw the crippled form of my father. 



Huddled together and missing one leg of his work jeans, although the rest of his clothes looked to be in a better state than mine. Displaying itself as I moved closer, still cautious of the frozen spawn surrounding us, most of his figure was conservatively stuck tight with only a handful of the same green spheres I'd seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. Not knowing his state of “aliveness,” I inched forward before the realization that the spheres looked even more familiar than initial inspection yielded. My foot brushing against something and causing a tinkling sound to ring out in the silence, I look down and see a shard. A green shard. 



My thoughts hit like a literal and metaphorical train as the end in one conclusion. Move. All stealth abandoned, I rush to my Pa’s side and check his pulse like health class taught. With a slow thrum I confirmed his continued existence, before taking my hands and shredding the bits of his uniform that were too stuck to the sickly pearls to extract. When my work was done, and the creatures around us stiff as ever, all that remained was a single external tumor on his right leg. His jeans remained as intact as I'd found him for the most part, and his over shirt had been completely coated, leaving behind a gray tank top beneath untouched. As I heaved his mostly free body to the side of the cave, one lone piece of bone separated itself from the rest, and fell to the floor. 



Raising my head at the sharp intrusion to the shuffling silence, I came to the conclusion I wasn't the only one drawn to the sudden noise. Each of the malformed, limbless things had ceased its unholy prayers, and turned their attention fully to the single bone that fell. While my breath hitched in my throat, I slowed my movement to a crawl, sliding off myself and my father against the ground seemingly not enough to alert them yet. When the movement of another of the worms caused a small avalanche of cream colored calcium, the monsters all together darted for the deluge. Twisting and engulfing any part of their presumed postmortem prey, the bundle grew in layers and size as they slid and intertwined with one another. Ideas and doubts racing through my mind, I picked a piece of what looked like a femur up from near my knelt down position, and tossed it towards the water amidst the feeding ball currently occuring. 



I was never good at any sports with a ball involved really, but this worked in my favor in this instance, as the piece landed short of the water by a few inches. Barely touching the waves ebbing to and fro from the scales bodies concealed beneath, the bone skittered to a stop with a slight ripple and splash. The ground based life forms took a moment to consult the validity of this new sound, before moving en masse and roiling around the new stimuli provided. As some slagged off of the main mass, the few unlucky enough to land in the liquid layer were quickly snatched and fought over by what gluttonous horrors awaited below the surface. 



Seeing the first light of hope, or maybe in my delusion the first action I felt confident enough to take given the bizarre situation, I rose carefully and braced myself against the wall while I gripped the handle of the shovel still strapped to my ragged leather belt. Placing my weight from the heels of my feet to the balls, I rocked my way as near as I could to the active empty buffet before me. Standing at attention within an arms length of the imminent danger, I eased the shovel from its bindings, eliciting a metallic -dink as it clashed against my belt buckle. The mass paused a bit, but continued with my unintentional warning unheeded in the slightest amidst potential food before it. Loosing the tool fully, I cocked my shoulders back and bent my knees in my best imitation of a golfer's stance. 



Slicing downward with all my might, I twisted my body up as the blade of the implement met solid flesh with a veritable slosh. Many of the cretins were damaged by the initial blow, but any that survived to some degree careened lopsidedly towards the far wall. The volleyball of veinless forms collided with rock hewn from the most solid of sediments, spewing parts of itself in a short circumference before collapsing into the water below. Residue from my actions made its home on the wall and shovel I held with dull purple murk. The presumed lifeblood of the munchkin land piranhas dripped from the cold steel I held while I reveled in the effectiveness of my actions in the moment. 



While the mysterious marine life enjoyed their unexpected all you can eat buffet, I moved myself a couple feet from the few remaining reptiles still chasing the location of the impact. Stabbing downwards I made sure to dispatch the last of the litters with haste, like one would any unsuspecting prey animal. As the flurry of motion in the pool waned off progressively, I felt the need for action drain from my body and mind, along with any coiled energy I held in tension. Crawling slowly towards the wall where my father lay up against, I curled up in the elbow of a few stones alongside him, quickly falling into the first and deepest sleep after all this time in the depths.

Pokhara Airport construction bela prithvi malla 3.0 bhathyo which was quickly hidden away with CAAN involved to sweep it under the rug.

>In late 2022, as the project neared completion, Zhu Zhanfeng, the contractor’s project site manager, was feeling boastful. He said in an interview that Pokhara would have “the first modern airport in Nepal” that adhered to the “Chinese standard.”

>**There was no mention of the fact that three years earlier, Mr. Zhu had struck and killed a pedestrian in Pokhara after a night of drinking. According to a police report, an officer at the scene suspected that Mr. Zhu was drunk when he struck Deu Kumar Tamang, who was walking in a crosswalk around 11 p.m. on July 2, 2019, with his Toyota Hilux, a pickup truck. Mr. Tamang died on impact from “blunt force injury to the abdomen,” according to the autopsy.**

>**Shortly after the crash, CAMC approached Mr. Tamang’s family to offer 1 million Nepali rupees, or about $7,500, as compensation, according to the victim’s brother, Nabin Tamang. When the family refused, a CAMC employee told his family that Mr. Tamang was “already dead” and that “you might as well settle,” Nabin Tamang said.**

>Then, CAMC offered to double the payment and grant the family space to open a coffee shop inside the new airport. The family, who live in a shack in a rural mountain village, accepted the offer. CAMC said it would pay only after Mr. Zhu was released from prison.

>**“Killing someone is a serious crime,” Nabin Tamang said. “They treated this like a minor business transaction.”**

>When the case went to trial, Mr. Zhu’s lawyers argued that Mr. Tamang had been drinking and that he “himself came to hit the car and the car didn’t hit the deceased,” according to court filings. His lawyers added that Mr. Tamang’s family had “already received last rites expenses.” Mr. Zhu said that he had consumed one beer earlier in the night and had been driving carefully when he struck Mr. Tamang.

>**Mr. Zhu was found guilty of committing a “traffic death” and sentenced to four months in prison — less than the maximum one-year sentence for that offense. He made bail after serving 50 days. He avoided the more serious charge of vehicular manslaughter, which carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.**

>When contacted by The Times, Mr. Zhu said it was “inconvenient” for him to discuss the incident and asked that all further inquiries be directed to the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, which did not respond to an email seeking comment.

>Mr. Zhu appealed the four-month sentence to Pokhara’s High Court, which ruled in his favor and determined that neither alcohol nor careless driving had played a role in the death. In February 2021, it reduced Mr. Zhu’s sentence to time already served.

1oaemh1,https://i.redd.it/81ecjvswezvf1.jpeg,Why Random Acts of Kindness Still Matter in a Selfish World - TheKoinBlog.com,"We are not, most of us, in the habit of expecting kindness. Not from strangers, not without motive, and certainly not without a price. The world trains us otherwise. Transactions, obligations, reciprocal arrangements; these are the grammar of our daily lives.

And so, when something inexplicably kind occurs, when someone holds the door without checking to see if we’re worth holding it for, or pays for our coffee without leaving a name, it lands not as a routine gesture but as a gentle interruption in the hard logic of modern life.

*Random acts of kindness*. The phrase has a folksy simplicity about it, something you might see on a magnet or scribbled in the corner of a community bulletin board. But the idea itself is quietly revolutionary.

What it suggests is this: that goodness need not be earned, that compassion need not be scheduled, and that the most meaningful offerings often arrive unannounced and vanish without ceremony.

Some people roll their eyes at such things. They mistake softness for sentimentality. They assume kindness is some relic of childhood cartoons or Sunday school stories best left behind when the rent is due and the traffic is bad.

But those who dismiss kindness as naïve tend to forget that cruelty is not exactly working wonders either.

There is something defiant in being kind for no reason. It is a refusal to let the world harden you. It requires imagination to extend yourself without calculating the return. It is, in a way, a form of protest against cynicism, not loud or angry, but firm in its refusal to disappear.

Of course, kindness is not always easy. Sometimes it feels like pouring water into a cracked jar. You smile at someone and they scowl back. You give time and it is wasted. You open your heart and no one notices. But this is the risk every true act of love carries. It is the chance that what you give may never be seen the way you meant it. And yet, you give anyway.

That is what makes it beautiful. That is what makes it sacred.

A random act of kindness is not random at all in its effect. It lands in the mind of the one who receives it like a seed dropped unexpectedly into soil. Sometimes it dies there. But sometimes, in ways you will never witness, it grows into something that lifts them out of whatever darkness they were quietly drowning in. You may never know. But not knowing is part of the point. It humbles you. It frees you from the need to be congratulated. It places you in the company of those who have learned to love without audience.

Perhaps that is why the truest kindness often occurs in obscurity. A coat left on a bench. A bag of groceries quietly placed at a door. A text sent to a friend just to say “I’m thinking of you” without asking for anything in return. These are not grand gestures. They are small breaches in the fabric of a world otherwise preoccupied with itself.

And in a time where noise is cheap and attention is currency, kindness is a strange form of wealth. It cannot be hoarded. It cannot be posted for validation without reducing its worth. It is real only when it asks for nothing.

Some will say this is not practical. That the world is too broken, too corrupt, too distracted for kindness to matter. But if we are to wait for the world to become gentle before we act gently, we will be waiting forever. We are not meant to mirror the world. We are meant to disturb it, gently and without permission.

So be kind. Not because it is efficient or logical. Not because it will fix the world. Be kind because it is good. Because someone once held the door for you. Because someone once believed in you when they had no reason to. Because someone once helped you breathe easier, even for a moment.

Be kind because this world is difficult enough without us adding to the weight of it.

And if that moment of kindness vanishes into the ether, never to be traced back to you, take heart. You have done something holy. You have left the world briefly better than you found it. And sometimes, that is the most human thing we can do.

I'm 32M, and I've been divorced for a while now and I'm just very lonely. I was on Facebook last week and ran into an old friend from my college years and decided to add her. We got to talking on Facebook for a week and decided to meet up at the park for a coffee and walk that weekend to catch up. We talked on the phone for a bit before we actually got to the park, which helped calm my nerves a bit, and the conversation on the phone flowed easily.
I saw her in person and thought she was very pretty and how very little she had changed from the person I had remembered 12 years ago (we were really good friends in a small friend group). We then walked around the park, talking about various things that's happened recently, and did a bit of people watching and laughing and had a great time. We spent two hours talking and walking, and the time just flew by so much so that we were both shocked at how fast it went.

Well, it was getting dark, and she invited me back to her place, and I offered to buy food. She had mentioned she had some wine she wanted me to try. We spent the next seven or so hours still laughing and talking about everything that's happened in our lives, childhoods, and just what we expected out of life rather than what actually happened, and just what we wanted from the future. Come to find out, we share a lot of the same hobbies. We both read a lot, watch anime, crime/prison documentaries, and just both want the same things out of a relationship. Well, she got a text and said that it was someone she was currently kind of talking to but not really anymore because he didn't want a serious relationship and wanted to focus on work and didn't think she wanted to be with him because of that. She said she wasn't worried about him because of that and wanted to focus on hanging out with me but was very upfront about who it was and what not.
 It got to the point where it was 2:30 AM and getting extremely late, and I had to go if either of us wanted to get any sleep for the night. She offered me to crash at her place, but it wasn't far from my house, so I decided to drive home.

I guess I got a bit sad on the drive home and still am I suppose because after the park and hang out at her place I was planning on asking her out on an actual date because of how well it went. We hit it off so well and I felt like everything just flowed so easily and we had such great chemistry that I thought   I found someone I would be excited to hang out with again. But when I heard that towards the end it got my hopes up because I'm thinking you have people that just so willingly throw away something you want for yourself and idk I guess I feel as though I'll never find my person in life.",1,1760841839.0,venting,1,1.0,False

I’ve been diving into different brewing methods lately, and after trying a few options, I wanted to get some opinions from the community about which coffee makers are your go-tos. I tested out a few popular ones: drip coffee makers, pour-over setups, and French press — and here’s what I found.

Drip Coffee Makers (e.g., Breville Bambino Plus, Cuisinart DCC-3200, Moccamaster KBGV)

Drip coffee makers are still the classic choice for a reason. They’re super easy to use, just fill the basket, add water, and let the machine do its thing. If you want something reliable and convenient, Moccamaster KBGV is a top-tier option. It’s pricey, but it brews consistently great coffee, often touted for its excellent temperature control and brewing speed. If you’re not looking to spend quite that much, Cuisinart DCC-3200 offers good quality at a lower price point, though I find it’s not quite as precise as the Moccamaster.

Pour-Over Coffee Makers (e.g., Chemex, Hario V60)

For a more refined cup, pour-over is the way to go. The Chemex and Hario V60 are classic choices that let you highlight all the subtle flavors in your coffee. It’s a more hands-on process compared to drip, but I’ve found that the results are well worth the extra effort. The pour-over method gives you more control over things like water temperature and pour technique, which is perfect if you love experimenting with different flavors. The coffee is usually more vibrant and cleaner compared to drip.

French Press (e.g., Bodum Chambord, Frieling Stainless Steel Press)

If you prefer a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee, French press is definitely the way to go. I’ve been using the Bodum Chambord, and the flavor it delivers is bold and satisfying, with all the oils and natural flavors of the beans coming through. The downside is the potential for a bit of grit, since the coffee grounds aren’t filtered out as much as with drip or pour-over methods. But if you're into a thicker, more robust cup, this is a solid choice.

Final Thoughts

Each of these brewing methods brings something unique to the table. If you’re all about convenience and consistent results, drip coffee makers like the Moccamaster KBGV are hard to beat. Pour-over is great if you want a more hands-on, precise brewing experience with a bright and clean cup, while French press is perfect for those who enjoy a deep, bold flavor profile.

Which one do you prefer? Or, do you have another favorite brewing method I haven’t mentioned? Would love to hear what coffee maker you swear by!",1,1760841666.0,smartbuysforlife,0,1.0,False

Ray looked back at his log, finding a record of his night spent searching the hallways of the empty establishment for a reason to be there. The clock in the corner of the screen read three fifty-eight AM. That couldn’t be right.
 
He winced again, feeling a trickle of pain dance from his mouth to the base of his skull. The bleeding had slowed, but he could still taste the faint whisper of copper. Maybe a cup of cold coffee from one of the many dormant breakrooms would help him through. He knew he could try and call someone, maybe get home or give the tired nurses in the emergency department something to do.
 
But he was in no hurry to go back to a newly uninhabited apartment. To feel more alone than someone in a seemingly abandoned building. His hand slid into his pocket, fingers gently tracing the edge of a ring he’d once sworn to wear to the grave.
 
A small shuffling drew his attention away from his sad little life, out the large pair of windows between him and the hospital parking lot. The darkest fog to ever haunt the night whispered out a roar only inches away, sand obscuring his ability to make out even the first car only meters away. 
 
His hazel eyes squinted through the blackest night, at the sight of something shift. A shadow slipping through shadows. His mind finally pieced together the glacial movement outside into a recognizable shape, and he was surprised to find a man ambling his way. 
 
He took a step towards the sliding doors, briefly wondering if it was someone lost in the sandstorm looking for the emergency room. Ray froze when the figure lurched another step closer, and he realized he couldn’t make out any features, there was no face of any kind.
 
There was a faded burlap bag tied over the man’s head. 
 
Beside him, the antique phone trilled, and he briefly looked down and pulled the receiver up to his ear. “William Beaumont front desk, Sergeant SinClair speaking.” His eyes squinted again, searching the shadow static outside to find nothing now. Just an empty walkway swallowed up by a dirty storm. 
 
A voice on the other end spoke through the echoing hiss on the line to say, “Hey Sergeant. I’m sorry to do this but we need you on Labor and Delivery.” Before he could ask the nurse on the other end went on, “There was a stillbirth up here. We need you to help with…” The man seemed to pause, searching for the morbid clause, “process it.” 
 
Ray let the nurse know he would be right up and gently slid the handle back on the receiver. Before making his way toward the elevators he slowed to a stop before the windows, eyes searching the dry maelstrom growing stronger by the minute.
 
But there was nothing there.

Hello! 
I did a spread yesterday of a few cards where I had asked about a recent break up. I just asked ""what do I need to know about the break up?"" What do I need to know for my highest good, etc. Something generic, not trying to lead the question! 

Anyways: in order of appearance: Ace of Cups, High Priestess, Three of Cups, 5 of swords. 
I sat the deck down but then accidentally hit it on the coffee table,  and the hermit and eight of wands in reverse came out!  Then I pulled Zebra, Deer, and Otter...Magician and six of pentacles came out together, then Seven of swords and five of cups in reverse came out. 

My interpretation is that there's a lot of good energy around me right now (ace of cups, three of cups, otter energy) and an emphasis on play, friendships, lightheartedness--a time for me and to sort of frolic and be free...looking at these cards a bit longer,  I could see the ace of cups representing a dynamic or a person that is struggling to healthily express emotions..both me and/ or him..it builds up then overflows?  Ace of cups is seemingly a good card with the other pairings..but then I look at 5 of swords? It seems tense (?) .. anyways I made a decision that was ultimately hard and maybe I just need to be alone right now(?) But I don't understand the five of swords, eight of wands in reverse, or the seven of swords.. And the hermit..I suppose there isn't much of the break up or him in this at all--which is very interesting for the reading. Do you all think the cards are asking me to shift my perspective, especially with five of cups in reverse?? Does this spread look at the ""ideal"" ? Or the actual energy, etc. 

Just trying to get additional perspective since I think doing your own readings can be a bit complicated - trying not to add too much of my own personal bias. ",1,1760841633.0,Tarotpractices,2,1.0,False

1oaeiri,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oaeiri/dumped_after_two_months_how_do_i_move_on/,Dumped after two months - how do I move on?,"So I met somebody at my gym probably six months ago, and for about three and a half months we were kind of doing the poking around of just saying hi, small stares—you know how it goes. And a few months ago, I was in the lobby of my gym having a coffee and reading a book, and he came up to me. It was a wonderful interaction. He pulled up a chair, and we were just chatting for the first time for about an hour, and it was a really nice conversation. So we followed each other on social media, and he messaged me that night, and he told me it was great talking to me and that he would love to take me out when he gets back in a few days from a business trip, which he was going to go on the next day.

Even when he was on that business trip, he was still sending me a bunch of pictures and talking to me, and when he got back, we went on that date, and it was one of the best first dates I've ever been on. It was just talking, he held my hand, and we were telling stories. We walked around the city for the whole day, and I was just I was thinking to myself, like, wow, is this what happens when you don't use Bumble to meet someone? HAHA

I actually had a trip planned to my hometown, which I had made arrangements for before I met him, and it was scheduled for a month after our first date. He knew that I was leaving for two months, but we spent every day of that month together. We went to the gym and the movies. We did everything imaginably possible within that month, and I just felt like I was living in a fairy tale. He was saying how we will spend Halloween and Christmas together, and just all of those lovely lines.

So I left, and at first it was super easy. We kept in contact, and maybe about a week and a half or two weeks after I left is when the decrease started. It started very subtly where it was just a missed phone call where he said he was going to call, and he didn't, and then probably a week after that I just felt like the texts were getting slower, and I kind of called him out about it very lightly, like, ""Hey, I feel like something's changed,"" and he blamed it on me and just said, ""I feel like you're being anxious.. Nothing's wrong"", so I let it go, and then about two and a half weeks later, things were getting worse.

The texts got even slower. He stopped saying good night. It was just obvious something was wrong, so I suggested a break until I get back there in a month (at that time), and he didn't even try to stop me. He just kind of said okay. He texted me back eight hours later and said that he's really stressed with work, and it's for the best. About three days ago, after not hearing from him for a few weeks, he sent me this long message about how work is consuming him and how he really doesn't have the energy to put into our connection because he has a lot of other priorities at the moment and said he really respects me and thinks I'm this amazing and beautiful girl that will succeed at life, and just basically ended it, and it really shook me to my core.

I really can't stop crying because I'm going back to our city in one week, and I know I'm going to run into him, and it's going to destroy me because I just don't understand how it went from amazing to this.. Any advice?",1,1760841542.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

We have previously been to Secrets Akumal (preferred), Secrets Cap Cana (preferred), and Impression Moxche. I’ve seen the chart pinned to the top but I can’t download it on my phone. Here are the most important factors:

1. Absolutely must be adults only. No sharing the resort with the family resort next door. 

2. Swim out room is strongly preferred. We have always spent a lot of time in our swimout and love a swim after dinner as well. Moxche’s “private” swim out was great, but we loved Akumal’s connected just as much (and actually had more privacy there).

3. Great food. Really great food. Akumal was good. Cap Cana was good. Impression Moxche was a huge step above both. I know all AIs are like cruises and mass produce food, but Impression Moxche didn’t feel like that at all. Cielo and Seaside were so good we ate there almost every meal. The one time we went to the Moxche side to eat, we left because it was terrible. That being said, now I’m worried I’ve spoiled myself and will be disappointed with anything but Impression Moxche now.

4. We don’t care about night life or the ocean. We don’t go to shows and aren’t super social people. We do like to drink coffee down by the beach in the early mornings but swimming in the ocean isn’t important.  

As far as budget, while a little flexible, I’m trying to keep it under $7K for 2 for 6-7 nights, which knocks Impression Moxche out. I’ve checked Costco and my Capital One Travel, but frankly it’s not a huge discount compared to booking directly with the resorts. I’ve got my eye on Unico 2087 but I keep reading mixed reviews, with some saying they love it and the food is great, and others saying it’s overrated and the food is just ok. I’ve checked out Arte, Valentin, and Atelier, and all are out of budget unfortunately. Any recommendations or am I dreaming on that budget?",2,1760841472.0,AllInclusiveResorts,4,1.0,False

Now that I'm 12 weeks in I wanted to share some things I've learned and honestly has me enjoying being a second time mom so much more than a first time mom. 

My first I was soooo worried about tracking everything. Ounces, wake windows, hours slept, etc. My second, there is no time and honestly I can't imagine trying. We just go off his vibes and cues and honestly I wish I had the confidence to do it the first time. Are days perfect? No 

Get. Out. Of. The. House. While sometimes getting out the door leaves me sweaty and questioning my sanity. Every time it's worth it. Granted both my boys do well in the car but they have to, we live 30 min from nearest large town and where our church is. But I'm not afraid of outings or meltdowns if they happen. Sometimes we just do our usual walk around town. Sometimes we go to the botanical gardens or grocery shop. Today we ventured to my hometown an hour and 15 min away. Bumped up nap time and we're gone from 10 am - 8:30 pm. It was wonderful. If I was a first time mom I would have been soooo anxious (also Lexapro has def helped this time around)

I've just accepted (and I love it) that this is my season of mom and wife era. I stay home and I treat it like my career and primary focus. Yes I try to workout and take care of me but this season is for my boys. The more I've focused on that and less on what about me time, the happier I've become and truly loved the simplicity of the days or maybe the monotony. 

I was SO worried about loving both of having time for both. My second son is pure joy. He's truly happy to be here. My first was harder in many ways and I wonder if I just made it harder or if he was - if that makes sense. But man I love both of my kids so much and I try to take time each week just with them. Sometimes my oldest just runs to the store with me and I'll take the baby for coffee with a friend. I've figured out how to manage it and get the quality time. 

Also, I have to say I'm really lucky to be blessed with a hands on and supportive husband. Our family is first. We each have a hobby but we prioritize our children and our relationship and do spend a lot of time together and obviously that has made parenting better and easier on me which I do not take for granted. 

All that to say, for those fretting and scared of the age gap, I'm not going to lie and say it's easy but I'm not sure parenting ever is. And this is the only age gap I know and will ever know so it's been okay. It's all a season and I think just go all in. I had all the apprehension of how I'd handle x,y,z scenario and eventually you just do or you have to and you become more and more confident in your parenting abilities. We've got this.

I cried when we talked, and now she says she doesn’t want us to be together. She even told me directly, “We’re not going to be a couple.”

Her sister unfollowed me, and I feel like her whole family probably hates me now.  
But I love her so much. I can’t stop thinking about her. She said she’ll meet me for coffee on December 1st, but she also said there’s only like a 5-10% chance of us ever being together again.

Since then, I’ve had no energy for anything. Not my studies, not my social life, nothing. I feel physically sick from missing her. I’m not going to hurt myself, but I just can’t imagine a future without her.

I’m seeing a psychologist soon, and I’m talking with a helpline, but I still feel so lost.  
I just want to know… has anyone ever been in this situation and somehow made it work again?  
Or how do you live with this kind of pain when the person you love says they’re done?

Any advice or words would help.

A Spiritual Guide to Making Mistakes

by ALIBI

-----

## Introduction: The Sacred Mess

You’ve dropped your coffee for the third time this week. You forgot an important meeting. You said the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment. Again. You might be wondering: what’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get anything right?

But what if nothing is wrong with you at all? What if these moments of messiness are actually messages—spiritual breadcrumbs leading you toward something deeper, truer, and more aligned with who you’re meant to be?

This book explores a radically different perspective on mistakes, one that sees them not as failures but as invitations. Each stumble, each forgotten task, each clumsy moment might be your soul’s way of getting your attention, asking you to pause, listen, and recalibrate.

The spiritual traditions of the world have long recognized that our outer chaos often reflects an inner misalignment. When we’re constantly messing up, we’re not broken—we’re being called to wake up.

## Chapter 1: Your Soul Needs You to Slow Down

### The Tyranny of Speed

We live in a world that worships speed. Faster responses, quicker results, immediate gratification. We’ve learned to treat our lives like a race we must win, cramming more tasks into less time, multitasking ourselves into a frenzy of partial attention and scattered energy.

But your soul doesn’t operate on deadlines. It moves at the pace of seasons, of breath, of genuine presence. When you’re racing through life, you disconnect from the wisdom of your body and the quiet whispers of your intuition. You become a stranger to yourself.

### Mistakes as Messengers

The dropped keys, the forgotten appointments, the words that come out all wrong—these aren’t random inconveniences. They’re your soul tapping you on the shoulder, trying to get your attention. Each mistake is a small rebellion against the tyranny of speed, a forced pause in the endless rush.

Think of it this way: when a computer gets overloaded, it freezes or crashes. Your mistakes might be your system’s way of forcing a restart, creating the pause you haven’t allowed yourself to take voluntarily.

### The Practice of Presence

Living mindfully means inhabiting your body and your moment fully. It means feeling your feet on the ground as you walk, tasting your food as you eat, listening completely when someone speaks. When you’re truly present, mistakes often dissolve because you’re paying attention to what you’re actually doing rather than thinking three steps ahead or ruminating on what happened yesterday.

Try this: For one full day, move at half your usual speed. Notice how this changes not just your error rate but the quality of your experience. Notice what you see, hear, and feel when you’re not rushing past your own life.

-----

## Chapter 2: The Root of the Matter—Understanding Your Foundation

### The Root Chakra: Your Energetic Foundation

In many spiritual traditions, the root chakra (Muladhara) represents our foundation—our sense of safety, security, and groundedness in the physical world. Located at the base of the spine, it’s our energetic root system, connecting us to the earth and to the stability we need to function in daily life.

When this energy center is balanced, you feel secure, present, and capable. You move through the world with confidence and steadiness. But when it’s blocked or imbalanced, you might feel scattered, anxious, and yes—clumsy.

### Signs of Imbalance

Physical clumsiness is often a manifestation of spiritual and emotional ungroundedness. If you’re constantly tripping, dropping things, or bumping into objects, your root chakra might be calling for attention. Other signs include:

- Financial anxiety or instability
- Feeling disconnected from your body
- Difficulty making decisions
- Constant worry about basic needs
- Feeling like you don’t belong anywhere
- Physical restlessness or inability to sit still

### The Sources of Instability

Root chakra imbalances often arise from real-world instabilities. Perhaps your job feels uncertain, your relationship is rocky, or you’re facing housing insecurity. Maybe you’ve recently moved or experienced a significant loss. These external circumstances create internal turbulence that manifests as physical awkwardness and mental fog.

Childhood experiences also play a role. If your early years were marked by instability, neglect, or trauma, your root chakra might bear those scars, making you more vulnerable to feeling ungrounded during times of stress.

### Restoring Your Foundation

Healing the root chakra involves both practical and spiritual work:

**Physical grounding practices**: Walk barefoot on grass or soil. Garden. Work with clay or earth. These activities literally reconnect you with the ground beneath your feet.

**Body awareness**: Yoga poses like Mountain Pose, Warrior I, or Child’s Pose help you feel your connection to the earth. Any practice that brings awareness to your lower body and legs strengthens your energetic foundation.

**Create stability**: Address practical concerns where possible. Create a budget if finances are chaotic. Establish routines that provide structure. Make your living space feel safe and nurturing.

**Red energy**: The root chakra is associated with the color red. Wear red, eat red foods (beets, strawberries, red peppers), or visualize red light at the base of your spine during meditation.

## Chapter 3: The Burden of Mental and Emotional Overload

### When Your Cup Overflows

Imagine your mind as a cup. Every worry, every responsibility, every unprocessed emotion adds more liquid to that cup. Eventually, it overflows. When this happens, there’s simply no room for the ordinary tasks of living. You forget things not because you’re careless but because your mental and emotional capacity is maxed out.

### The Exhausted Mind

Mental exhaustion doesn’t just make you tired—it makes you incompetent. Your brain, overwhelmed and depleted, starts dropping balls. You can’t focus because your attention is already fully occupied by the background noise of stress, anxiety, and unprocessed emotions.

Research shows that chronic stress actually impairs the prefrontal cortex—the part of your brain responsible for executive function, decision-making, and impulse control. In other words, when you’re constantly stressed, your brain literally can’t perform the functions that prevent mistakes.

### The Physical Manifestation

Your body keeps the score. Emotional and mental overload doesn’t just live in your head—it shows up in your actions. Dropped dishes, forgotten appointments, and misplaced keys are your body’s way of saying “I can’t carry this anymore.”

Each mistake is a message: you’re carrying too much. Something needs to be released, processed, or resolved before you can function normally again.

### The Path to Clarity

**Empty the cup regularly**: Just as you wouldn’t drink from an overflowing cup, you can’t function well with an overloaded mind. Create daily practices that help you process and release:

- Journal to externalize thoughts and feelings
- Talk to a trusted friend or therapist
- Engage in vigorous exercise to release stored tension
- Cry when you need to—tears are the body’s release valve

**Single-tasking**: Multitasking is a myth. What we call multitasking is actually rapid task-switching, and it depletes mental resources quickly. Practice doing one thing at a time with your full attention.

**Rest as a spiritual practice**: In our productivity-obsessed culture, rest feels like failure. But rest is when your nervous system resets, when your mind processes and consolidates information, when your body heals. Sleep, nap, and simply sit without agenda. This isn’t laziness—it’s necessary maintenance.

**Boundaries**: Learn to say no. Every yes to something is a no to something else—often your own wellbeing. Protecting your energy isn’t selfish; it’s self-preservation.

-----

## Chapter 4: When Opposition Means You’re on the Right Path

### The Resistance Principle

There’s a curious spiritual paradox: the closer you get to your true purpose, the more obstacles you might encounter. This isn’t punishment or bad luck—it’s a sign that you’re making progress, that you’re stepping into territory that matters, that you’re threatening the status quo of your old life.

Steven Pressfield calls this “Resistance” in his book *The War of Art*. It’s that force that shows up precisely when you’re about to do something meaningful, something that will help you grow or serve others. It manifests as procrastination, self-doubt, conflict, or yes—a sudden increase in mistakes and mishaps.

### Testing Your Commitment

Spiritual opposition serves as a filter. It asks: How much do you want this? Are you willing to persist when things get difficult? Many people turn back at the first sign of resistance, interpreting obstacles as signs they’re on the wrong path. But often, the opposite is true.

Think of it like exercising. The resistance of the weights is what builds muscle. Without resistance, there’s no growth. The spiritual journey works the same way. The challenges you face when pursuing your purpose aren’t roadblocks—they’re the very means of your strengthening.

### Distinguishing Resistance from Wrong Direction

How do you know if obstacles mean you should push through or change course? Here are some distinctions:

**Push through when**:

- You feel fear but also deep conviction
- The goal aligns with your values and serves others
- You’re learning and growing despite the difficulty
- There’s a sense of meaning in the struggle
- You feel called, even if you feel inadequate

**Change course when**:

- You feel constant dread with no underlying passion
- You’re causing harm to yourself or others
- You’ve lost sight of why this mattered
- Your body is breaking down (not just tired, but chronically ill)
- You’re pursuing someone else’s dream, not your own

### Embracing the Hero’s Journey

Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey describes a pattern found in myths worldwide: the hero receives a call, faces challenges and opposition, descends into darkness, and emerges transformed with gifts to share. Your life follows this same pattern.

The mistakes and mishaps you’re experiencing might be part of your descent, the difficult middle section where everything seems to go wrong. This is exactly where the hero wants to give up and go home. But it’s also where the transformation happens.

Your opposition is proof that you’re on a journey worth taking.

-----

## Chapter 5: The Humbling of the Ego

### The Illusion of Self-Sufficiency

The ego loves to believe it has everything under control. It tells you that you should be able to handle everything independently, that asking for help is weakness, that you should be perfect and strong and invulnerable. This is, of course, completely unsustainable.

When you keep messing up despite your best efforts, the ego’s illusion crumbles. You’re forced to confront the truth: you’re human, limited, and in need of grace—both from yourself and from something greater than yourself.

### The Gift in Humiliation

The word “humility” shares a root with “humus”—earth, soil, ground. To be humbled is to be brought back down to earth, to remember that you’re made of dust and to dust you shall return. This isn’t meant to degrade you but to free you from the exhausting burden of trying to be godlike.

Mistakes humiliate the ego, but they nourish the soul. Each time you fail and the world doesn’t end, you learn that you’re more than your performance. You discover that your worth isn’t determined by your perfection but exists independent of your achievements.

### Learning Dependence

Western culture celebrates independence as the highest virtue. But every spiritual tradition recognizes that true strength involves acknowledging our dependence—on each other, on nature, on the divine. We’re not meant to do life alone.

When mistakes force you to ask for help, accept support, or admit you don’t have all the answers, you’re practicing a deeper form of strength. You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t weakness—it’s the doorway to connection and grace.

### Releasing Control

The need to control everything comes from fear. If you can just manage every variable, plan for every contingency, and execute everything perfectly, then you’ll be safe. But life is fundamentally uncontrollable, and the attempt to control it creates immense suffering.

Constantly dropping and breaking things can be the universe’s way of showing you that your grip is too tight. Some things are meant to fall. Some plans are meant to change. Some outcomes are meant to surprise you. Learning to let go—of perfection, of control, of outcomes—is one of life’s most important spiritual lessons.

-----

## Chapter 6: The Universe’s Call for Change

### When the Old Must Break

There’s a Japanese art form called kintsugi, where broken pottery is repaired with gold, making the breaks part of the object’s beauty and history. The philosophy recognizes that breakage and repair are part of an object’s story, not something to hide but to highlight.

Your life sometimes requires the same process. Things must break before they can be repaired and made more beautiful. The mistakes you’re making might be the breaking—uncomfortable, messy, but necessary for what comes next.

### Reading the Signs

Repeated mishaps can be symbolic messages pointing you toward necessary transformation. Pay attention to what keeps breaking or going wrong:

- Breaking dishes or glasses might signal a need to release old patterns or relationships
- Losing things could indicate you’re holding too tightly to the past
- Technology malfunctions might suggest you need to disconnect and return to simpler ways
- Spilling water could represent emotional overflow needing expression
- Dropping food might mean you’re not nourishing yourself properly

These aren’t superstitions but invitations to reflection. What might these patterns be trying to tell you about what needs to change?

### Releasing What No Longer Serves

We often cling to jobs, relationships, beliefs, and identities long after they’ve stopped serving our growth. We stay in the known discomfort rather than risk the unknown possibility. But sometimes life has to create such chaos in the old that we have no choice but to reach for something new.

Ask yourself: What am I holding onto that’s already broken? What part of my life is ready to be released? What am I afraid to let go of, even though it’s weighing me down?

### The Phoenix Process

The mythical phoenix must burn completely before it can rise from the ashes. The caterpillar must dissolve into formless goo before it can become a butterfly. Some transformations require complete dissolution of the old form.

If your life feels like it’s falling apart, you might be in a phoenix moment. Everything you knew, everything you counted on, everything you thought you were—it’s all burning away. This is terrifying, but it’s also sacred. The dissolution is making room for a truer version of you to emerge.

### Building the New

Once you’ve released what no longer serves, you have space to build something new. But build differently this time. Build with the wisdom earned through your mistakes. Build with more flexibility, more authenticity, more alignment with your true values.

Your mistakes have refined you, stripped away the false, and revealed what truly matters. Use this clarity to create a life that feels like home to your soul.

-----

## Chapter 7: The Practice of Spiritual Response

### Forgiveness: The Foundation of Freedom

The first and most crucial spiritual response to your mistakes is forgiveness—specifically, self-forgiveness. You must free yourself from the prison of self-blame, that voice that says you’re fundamentally flawed, that you should be better, that you’re not enough.

Forgiveness doesn’t mean pretending the mistakes didn’t happen or that they didn’t have consequences. It means accepting that you’re human, that you did the best you could with what you knew, and that you deserve compassion rather than condemnation.

**A forgiveness practice**: Place your hand on your heart and say, “I forgive myself for not being perfect. I forgive myself for my mistakes. I release myself from shame and blame. I am learning, growing, and doing my best.”

Repeat this daily, especially when you mess up. Over time, you’ll internalize a new voice—one of kindness rather than criticism.

### Grounding and Alignment Practices

When you’re feeling scattered and mistake-prone, grounding practices help restore your sense of stability and presence.

**Earthing**: Walk barefoot on natural ground—grass, sand, soil. Research shows this literally balances your body’s electrical charge and reduces inflammation and stress.

**Tree meditation**: Stand or sit with your back against a tree. Feel its solidity, its rootedness, its patient presence. Imagine roots growing from your body deep into the earth, anchoring and stabilizing you.

**Body scan**: Lie down and slowly move your attention through your body from toes to head. Notice any tension, numbness, or discomfort without judgment. This practice reconnects you with physical reality and brings you out of mental chaos.

**Breath work**: Simple breathing practices calm the nervous system and bring you into the present moment. Try box breathing: inhale for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four, hold for four. Repeat for several minutes.

**Nature immersion**: Spend time in natural settings without agenda. Sit by water, walk in woods, watch clouds. Nature has a way of resetting our internal rhythms and reminding us of larger patterns and cycles.

### Prayer and Meditation

Whether you relate to God, the Universe, Higher Self, or simply the mysterious intelligence that animates all life, turning to something greater than your ego is profoundly healing.

**Prayer for guidance**: “Help me understand what these mistakes are trying to teach me. Show me what I need to see, change what needs changing, and give me the strength and wisdom to walk this path.”

**Confession and release**: Honestly acknowledge your shortcomings, not to grovel but to release the burden of carrying them alone. “I’m struggling. I keep making mistakes. I feel inadequate. I need help.”

**Meditation for clarity**: Sit quietly and ask, “What do I need to know right now?” Then listen. Not for a booming voice, but for the quiet knowing that arises when you create space for it.

**Gratitude practice**: Even in the midst of chaos, especially then, find things to appreciate. Gratitude shifts your perspective from what’s wrong to what’s working, from scarcity to abundance. It doesn’t deny problems but refuses to let them define your entire reality.

### Seeking Growth, Not Perfection

Perfectionism is a spiritual trap. It sets an impossible standard that ensures you’ll always feel inadequate, always be striving, never be enough. The spiritual path isn’t about becoming perfect—it’s about becoming more fully yourself, which includes your flaws, your limitations, your humanity.

**Reframe mistakes as data**: Each mistake provides information. What can you learn? What would you do differently next time? What’s this teaching you about yourself or your situation? When mistakes become teachers rather than failures, they lose their power to shame you.

**Embrace the beginner’s mind**: In Zen Buddhism, “beginner’s mind” refers to approaching life with openness and curiosity, without preconceptions. When you’re willing to be a beginner, to not know, to make the mistakes that come with learning, you open yourself to genuine growth.

**Progress, not perfection**: The goal is to be slightly better today than yesterday, slightly wiser this year than last. Not perfect, not superior to others, just incrementally growing. This sustainable approach honors your humanity while still moving you forward.

### The Power of Laughter

Taking yourself too seriously is exhausting. It makes every mistake a catastrophe, every misstep a referendum on your worth. But when you can laugh at yourself—genuinely, kindly—you rob mistakes of their power to devastate you.

Humor creates space between you and your errors. You’re not your mistakes; you’re the awareness observing them, and that awareness can find them amusing rather than tragic.

**Develop your inner comedian**: When you mess up, try narrating it as if you’re a character in a sitcom. The exaggeration and distance this creates can help you see the humor in the situation.

**Share your blunders**: Perfection isolates; vulnerability connects. When you share your mistakes with others, you usually discover they have similar stories. Laughter together creates bonds and reminds you that everyone struggles.

**Find the absurd**: Life is genuinely absurd sometimes. The same person who can ponder the mysteries of existence can also walk into a glass door. This contradiction is hilarious if you let it be.

-----

## Chapter 8: Integration—Living with Compassionate Awareness

### The Ongoing Practice

Spiritual growth isn’t a destination you reach and then you’re done. It’s an ongoing practice, a daily choice to bring consciousness and compassion to your life. You’ll have periods of clarity and periods of chaos, times when you feel aligned and times when you feel like a disaster.

This is normal. This is the rhythm of growth. The key is developing the awareness to notice where you are and the compassion to be okay with it.

### When Mistakes Happen Again

Because they will. You’ll think you’ve learned the lesson, made the shift, resolved the issue—and then you’ll find yourself making similar mistakes again. This doesn’t mean you’ve failed or learned nothing. It means you’re human and growth is spiral, not linear.

Each time you encounter a familiar mistake, you meet it from a slightly different place. You have more awareness, more tools, more perspective. The spiral brings you back to similar territory but at a higher level of understanding.

Be patient with yourself. Be patient with the process. Transformation takes time.

### Signs of Progress

How do you know if this spiritual approach is working? Look for these signs:

- You recover more quickly from mistakes
- Your inner critic’s voice gets quieter or kinder
- You feel more grounded even during chaos
- You can laugh at yourself more easily
- You’re less afraid of making mistakes
- You notice patterns more quickly
- You feel more connected to something larger than yourself
- You treat yourself and others with more compassion

These shifts might be subtle, but they’re profound. They indicate that you’re moving from a place of fear and shame to one of trust and self-acceptance.

### Your Unique Path

The spiritual interpretations and practices in this book are offerings, not prescriptions. Take what resonates, leave what doesn’t, and adapt what you use to fit your own beliefs and circumstances. Your spiritual path is yours alone.

Maybe you resonate with chakras and energy work. Maybe you prefer prayer and scripture. Maybe you find your spirituality in nature, in relationships, in art, or in silence. Whatever your path, the core message remains: your mistakes are not evidence of your inadequacy but invitations to deeper awareness, greater alignment, and more authentic living.

### The Invitation

Your mistakes are knocking at your door, trying to tell you something. Will you answer? Will you listen to what they’re trying to teach you about slowing down, finding balance, releasing control, or changing direction?

The choice is yours. You can continue to berate yourself, to see your errors as proof of your unworthiness. Or you can begin to see them as sacred messengers, as uncomfortable gifts wrapped in frustration and embarrassment but containing exactly the lesson you need right now.

The spiritual path isn’t about transcending your humanity—it’s about embracing it fully, mistakes and all. It’s about bringing consciousness and compassion to every part of your life, even (especially) the parts that feel most broken.

You are not broken. You are being broken open. And what’s emerging is more authentic, more compassionate, and more aligned with your deepest truth than what came before.

-----

## Conclusion: The Beauty of Being Human

We began this book with a question: What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get anything right?

Now, perhaps, you can see that these were the wrong questions. The right question is: What are my mistakes trying to teach me?

Being human means being imperfect. It means making mistakes, falling down, getting lost, breaking things, and having to start over. But it also means learning, growing, connecting, forgiving, and becoming more fully yourself with each passing day.

Your mistakes are not obstacles to your spiritual journey—they are the journey. Each error is an opportunity to practice self-compassion, to release control, to ask for help, to humble your ego, and to align more closely with your authentic path.

You are not failing at life. You are learning to be human, which is the hardest and most sacred thing any of us will ever do.

So the next time you drop your coffee, forget an important task, or say the wrong thing at the wrong time, take a breath. Smile if you can. And ask yourself: What is this trying to teach me? What is my soul asking me to notice?

Then listen. Really listen. The answer might surprise you, challenge you, or comfort you. But it will be exactly what you need to hear.

Your mistakes are speaking. It’s time to listen.

## Acknowledgments

To every person who has ever felt like a walking disaster, who has wondered what’s wrong with them, who has beaten themselves up over mistakes big and small—this book is for you. Your struggles are not signs of inadequacy but of humanity, and your willingness to keep going despite them is nothing short of heroic.

May you be gentle with yourself.
May you find meaning in your mistakes.
May you remember that you are enough, exactly as you are.

I miss that instant relief for morning anxiety, its so difficult to go through life when anything that ever bothers me I could just stop that feeling with a few shots.

10 months ago I was crawling out of a few months long bender. I was getting out of the military, staying at an old friend from the services house. Drank 20+ beers and managed to piss on everything except the toilet bowl, got kicked out by my buddy at 3am for that. Drove hammered to the base to check out. Drank more in the bathroom on base and went to the airport. Cutoff came from the stewardess as soon as I asked for a mini, they saw me stumble my way on.

I'd like to say I got sober after that but I came home and drank all day, every day for a few weeks. I didn't eat for a week, if I wasn't drinking I was sleeping 14 or more hours. Hiding handles of vodka in my attic, telling my wife that I must be sick from my trip. 

I threw up coffee ground looking shit. No health care and I didn't start my new job for a few weeks. I tapered. Tapered down from over a liter of vodka to what I thought would help me not WD. The hallucinations and sweats were much stronger that time. 4 days of misery and puking bile with a mix of old and new blood. Survived just fine I'm lucky to be young and dumb I suppose.

It's amazing that I can remember how desperate I felt to just stop or die during that last bender. And all I want is a fucking drink.
