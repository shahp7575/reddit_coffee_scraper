Hoping to get some advice/insight on this situation I‚Äôm in as I continue to get mixed signals, leading me to honestly feel so lost in all this.

So I (27M) have this friend, let‚Äôs call her Patty (25F). We‚Äôve known each other almost our whole lives (we‚Äôre both of the same ethnicity so we‚Äôve always had mutual family friends). Throughout our lives we were never really friends, not for any particular reason, we knew each other but just never got to actually know each other. 

About 3 years ago, I happened to meet her cousin in law, let‚Äôs call her Kat, through this company i worked for at the time. Kat and I hit it off and became close friends very quickly. Kat would invite me to her family functions, kids‚Äô bday parties, Christmas parties, etc. Of course Patty and the rest of her family (she has a pretty big family) would always be there.

About a year in, Kat helped her cousin Patty get a job at the company, and that‚Äôs when we started to really see each other often and actually get to know each other more. We became basically work best friends, and began to hang out and talk more outside of work, however it was not anything too significant at the time. Nothing flirty or anything of that manner.

Also, for some backstory, between 2018 through summer of 2024, I was in a LTR. So honestly, when me and Patty started to work together and become closer and closer of friends, I never saw her in a romantic way like that. For one, I was in a devoted relationship and am not the type to cheat. Additionally, I don‚Äôt feel like I was ever attracted to Patty at the time. I mean sure she‚Äôs an attractive woman, but I never really looked at her in that way.

After about a year of working together, I ended up moving to another company. Patty and I kept in touch but would not really see each other or talk to each other regularly. I was still in a relationship, so I never had any feeling or urge to constantly reach out or see her. And although we were very good friends, I haven‚Äôt always been the best at staying in touch with all my friends especially over the course of time during my relationship. 

To add some more details, I‚Äôve been dealing with a pretty serious chronic medical condition over the last 6 years of my life. Although Patty and I hadn‚Äôt been seeing each other much after leaving my last job, she would consistently do things to support me and show me she cared about me and my health. She would bring me supplements, food, and just little gifts to uplift my spirits. She also would consistently try to get through to me spiritually and bring me closer to god, who my relationship with has been strained for quite a while now. She‚Äôs been very much a rock for me over this past year. She‚Äôs very grounded and it‚Äôs refreshing. I feel that my life has been in shambles and she tends to help me feel more put together I guess. I truly admire her and her character.

This year, Patty and I have been a lot closer. We started talking and seeing each other more often towards the beginning of the year. We‚Äôd hang out maybe once every 2 months for the first half of 2024. Which was more than we really would before.

This past July, my ex and I broke up, and within the same 2 weeks, Patty and a guy she was talking to at the time called it quits. We were there for each other, as a shoulder to lean/cry on. We started seeing each other even more often then. It became more like once a week or every other week. At first it was constantly talking about our relationship trauma. But those scars inevitably healed and we would just find ourselves hanging out to just hang out n be around each other.

Her bday was a few months ago, and she even texted me at midnight while I was out of the country at the time to tell me to call her so i could be the first to wish her a happy birthday. We would go to coffee shops often to work, and she would consistently refer to them as ‚Äúcafe dates.‚Äù She constantly invites me to her family outings, where I‚Äôm the only non-family there. When we hang out, I find that we‚Äôre always physically very close. Nothing in that sense has happened at all, but there‚Äôs definitely a level of comfortability there where I can touch her arm/leg or her hair without there being anything odd about it. She even came over last week and stayed up super late with me 2 nights in a row, sitting super close and watching movies together.

I‚Äôve tried to be subtly flirty many times but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just terrible at flirting now or if she just doesn‚Äôt acknowledge it as that. I try to compliment her quite often, every time I see her I‚Äôll always comment on something about her outfit or hair or whatever. But idk, I feel like it feels a bit forced. I also am a textbook over thinker, so that never helps what‚Äôs going through my head.

My friends, coworkers, family, and therapist all think that I have developed these more intimate feelings towards her. They also think that she has some level of interest as well. I just don‚Äôt know if I see it. They seem to be so confident that she‚Äôs interested in me given the way our friendship has been over the last few months, but something tells me it‚Äôs not exactly like that. 

A few weeks ago when we were hanging out, she even asked me for help transferring some photos from her phone to laptop. Come to find out that this album she was transferring was full of old pictures and videos of her and her exes. I seen the album as I was helping her and it honestly really turned me off and kindve annoyed me a bit. That‚Äôs when I knew that I was really feeling these feelings for her. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something like that is something you‚Äôd show a ‚Äúgay best friend.‚Äù I feel like if she saw me in any romantic way, that might not be something to show me.

Idk I feel like I‚Äôm rambling here and idk if it even all makes sense. My feelings are just so conflicted and it‚Äôs been shitty. My therapist thinks I should just be straight with her, but I feel like I‚Äôm scared of the result. I genuinely care about her so much and she makes me happy, but idk if I could stay a friend to her. But I also don‚Äôt want to lose her.",0,1735173910.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

But if they charge per minute on the books i won't do that. Are there some free books  in the tablet?

They said she could.do that Friday night when she drops me off and I should have my coffee pack by Monday morning...the e books should go right on the tablet. Does that sound right? Idc about snacks and noodles. Just coffee and books. And phone time.

I was twenty-two, desperate, and incredibly stupid‚Äîa potent cocktail for poor life choices. I‚Äôd lit the candles in my dorm room, scratched out a pentagram on the hardwood with my car keys, and recited the incantation from some ancient forum post buried in the depths of the internet.

Twenty years later, I had no regrets.

‚ÄúYou really came through, buddy,‚Äù I said, swirling the whiskey in my glass. I leaned back on my leather armchair, the skyline of the city twinkling through the massive windows of my penthouse. ‚ÄúA wife I don‚Äôt hate, a career that‚Äôs practically god-tier, and my parents finally shut up about med school. Hell, I owe you my life.‚Äù

Ferrox was sprawled on my custom Italian sofa, one cloven hoof resting on the coffee table. He looked up from the magazine he was flipping through‚ÄîBetter Homes and Gardens‚Äîand smirked. ‚ÄúFunny you should say that, Jonah. Because today, I‚Äôm cashing in.‚Äù

The room went silent except for the distant hum of the city below. I froze, my glass hovering mid-air. ‚ÄúCashing in?‚Äù I asked, though I already knew the answer.

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù Ferrox stood, stretching his broad shoulders until I heard the cracks reverberate in my bones. ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs up, buddy. Twenty years of wishes, dreams, and me pulling your sorry ass out of every fire. Now it‚Äôs your turn to help me.‚Äù

I set the glass down carefully, like it might explode. ‚ÄúOkay, uh‚Ä¶define ‚Äòhelp.‚Äô Because I‚Äôm not great with heavy lifting.‚Äù

Ferrox laughed, a deep, throaty sound that made the lights flicker. ‚ÄúNothing so mundane. No, Jonah. You‚Äôre coming with me. To Hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶Hell.‚Äù The words tasted like ash. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶forever?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù He waved a clawed hand dismissively. ‚ÄúJust long enough to help me get my startup off the ground.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúYour what?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy startup.‚Äù He grinned, his sharp teeth catching the light. ‚ÄúYou think I want to be a lackey forever? No, no, no. I‚Äôve got ideas, Jonah. Big ideas. And I need a mortal like you to help me pitch them to the board.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe board?‚Äù I echoed, my voice climbing an octave. ‚ÄúYou mean like the‚Ä¶Demon Council? The Lords of the Pit? The guys who invented eternal damnation and pineapple pizza?‚Äù

Ferrox nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the ones. They‚Äôre all so stuck in the past. Eternal torment, screaming souls, blah, blah, blah. Where‚Äôs the innovation? The synergy? Hell needs a rebrand, Jonah, and I‚Äôm the demon to do it.‚Äù

I stared at him, half-expecting a camera crew to pop out and yell ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äù But Ferrox was dead serious.

‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt want to go to Hell,‚Äù I said finally, leaning forward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a soft mortal. I have skin that burns. I like air-conditioning. I will die down there, Ferrox.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt die,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell, not unless you do something stupid, like insult a Duke of Torment or touch the lake of acid without permission. Besides, I‚Äôll protect you. We‚Äôre friends, remember?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to argue, then closed it. He wasn‚Äôt wrong. Twenty years of magical interventions had given me everything I wanted. Could I really balk now, when he was asking for one favor in return?

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said reluctantly. ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll go. But if I so much as stub a toe down there, I‚Äôm haunting you for eternity.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù Ferrox clapped his massive hands together, and the room filled with the smell of sulfur and ozone. The floor cracked open beneath us, and we plummeted into the abyss.

Hell was‚Ä¶not what I expected.

Sure, there were the lava rivers, the howling souls, and the overwhelming stench of brimstone. But there were also cubicles. Endless rows of them, each staffed by demons hunched over flickering computer monitors.

‚ÄúThis is HR,‚Äù Ferrox explained as we walked past a line of imps holding paperwork. ‚ÄúAnd over there‚Äôs Marketing. They‚Äôre the ones who came up with the whole ‚Äòeternal flames‚Äô branding. It‚Äôs outdated, but effective.‚Äù

I was too stunned to reply.

We finally reached a massive obsidian conference room. At the head of the table sat a creature so grotesque, my brain refused to fully process it. ‚ÄúAh, Ferrox,‚Äù it gurgled, its voice like sludge pouring over rocks. ‚ÄúThis better be good.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it is.‚Äù Ferrox shoved me into a chair and launched into his pitch.

‚ÄúPicture this,‚Äù he began, pacing like a CEO. ‚ÄúA Hell that‚Äôs not just for punishment, but for entertainment. The damned don‚Äôt just suffer‚Äîthey perform. Think reality TV meets gladiator combat. Streaming straight to Earth. We call it‚Ä¶Infernal Idol.‚Äù

The demon lords murmured, intrigued. I buried my face in my hands. This was my afterlife‚Äîa demonic Shark Tank pitch.

By the end of the meeting, Ferrox had the board‚Äôs approval and a budget bigger than my net worth. He clapped me on the back, grinning ear to ear.

‚ÄúSee? Easy. Now let‚Äôs go celebrate. Drinks are on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúFerrox,‚Äù I groaned, ‚Äúyou owe me so much more than drinks.‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù he said, his grin widening. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got an eternity to work it out.‚Äù

Last summer i met a girl, full head over heels for her, she is cute, clever, and lost of wonderfull things and, as far as her friends said, she liked me too. Sadly none of us ended taking the step and we didn't kiss or anything (idk why, i just felt stupid for a long time for that) but kept im contact (we live like 9h away from each other) during this last 4 months, like maybe 2-3days convos each 2 weeks or so.

Im not gonna lie, for me (as i guess most of this sub) its really difficult to fall in love, and specially feeling atracted in a sexual manner so the last few months i was hoping for reuniting again an finally being able to talk things out and decide if we even wanted to start dating or, at least, if we weren't going to act on It and keep being friends, It reached a point in which i just wanted a conclussion, wasnt fully about being together (but of course I prefered the first option).

Fastforward to 2 days ago, she texted me to decide a day to grab some coffee and catch Up on how our lifes are going because she is coming to visit her family for christmas. We've spend the evening together, first coffee and later dinner when we saw some of our Friends and decided to join.

During coffe I just started to feel.....different? Idk why but I wasnt as invested as i was a few months ago, I still wanted to talk with her and enjoyed listening her Talk about her projects, passions and stuff.....but It wasnt the same, i no longer found myshelf lost looking at her eyes, lips or beautiful hair or feeling the dessire to kiss her, i was just enjoying It but nothing more.

When she went to the bathroom I texted a couple of Friends with whom i talked with and asked for advice during this past months, including my two girl flatmates Who had been taking Up all my rants most of the time (i was really obsesed with this girl, never felt like that in my whole life) and my texts were along the lines of:

-we've been talking and sitting close to each other for two hours and i don't feel like wanting anything, like kissing her or wathever

-we're talking, but i don't think im enjoying It as much as i did in the past

So, as the evening kept going i kept thinking to myself stuff like:

-ok maybe I overstimated her in my head this past months, but i still like her, right?

-i mean i wouldn't back off if she tried to kiss me, but am I willing to try kissing her, i don't feel the need anymore

And stuff like that, but at one point, I don't know if trying to tease me she said: 

-oh and maybe I'll visit Germany with my Friends this summer, omg, she already told me that we sould be worried about all those German boys (idk how to express this on english, its not my first lenguaje, but its along the lines of "" having a lot of oportunities to hook Up or something like that"")

Okay, I had spent the whole ""date"" feeling unsure, but after that statement i felt (man i don't wanna use disgusted) deeply unpleased and if my level of atraction was a 5/10 it just went to -1/10. And after we joint our Friends for dinner and started speaking about one of our Friends dating life and a girl he has started seeing she said something along the lines of "" yeah you're supossed to start with a coffee or something like that, i preffer to jump to the action sooner but each one has their ways "" so i just felt really un confortable with that, like really disregarding with how i do things.

Im not in any way trying to say that her way of living life is wrong or bad in comparation to mine or anyone else, its just that those comments felt really unpleasant?/obnouxious (idk man) to me, and made me loose the little atraction i had left for her. But of course I still cheriss her as a very good person whose company I enjoy, but only on a purely frienship way. 



IM SORRY I TURNED THIS INTO A RANT, ITS 3 AM AND WANTED TO TELL THIS TO SMONE

Sorry if this sounds judgemental in some kind of way, i still have to catch upon how to transmit emotions in english on the written format

Now I'm not going to get ahead of myself here so let's go to the beginning shall we. This past summer I went to the islam where my mom lives,  and it was a time FILLED with new discoveries. I Had just broken up with my ex girlfriend who I had been with for 5 months and had a crush on for4 years. I also had just found out that this guy I had a minor crush on said that ‚Äú[i was] pretty, but [i] talked too much,‚Äù WITH THE YAPPING HAND SIGNAL. Needless to say i was in some rough shape self esteem wise. Coming to the island I was told that I was no longer going to be able to go to Europe with my sister which we had been planning for like a year and a half. I was also superrr mad at adult figures in my life and quite frankly finished one of the worst school years academic wise of my life. One thing that helped me was reconnecting with myself on the island. The island has always been a place of peace for me. In California my life is always super busy and go go go but here it was always simple and I appreciated it. Now I am hanging out with my aunt Kristine and my cousin cassidy. These are two people I find truly listen to me and acknowledge what I have to offer.  This year was odd because I came across a rather odd thought. What if I moved to the island? I had thought about it before but I have never been one for change. This year though I found myself oddly serious on the matter. So naturally I brought it up to my aunt and my cousin. My cousin was the person i told first, she naturally was ecstatic because we have been insanely close for as long as i can remember,  we truly are each other's best friends, and not seeing each other more often kills us both. I find myself insanely sad every time i have to go back to california where for the first week being back i just cry because i miss her so much. It would also be something I feel would be good for her, she has been taking a rather darker path lately and whenever she's with me i find she doesn't fall into her bad habits. I just worry about her so much when I'm not there. Now telling my aunt she too was on board but she required more of my reasoning behind the idea. After I stated what needed to be said and how I truly felt she completely understood where I was coming from and completely supported the idea. Ok now picture this me and my cousin are on like day 2 of our week long sleepover and we got bored so we started going through the instagrams of everyone at her school. As we are going through this specific guy catches my eye. I really don't know how to describe it but I was just drawn to him. He was completely my type, played guitar, in a band, funny, brunette hair brown eyes. I started to ask a bit more about him but on the down low of course because i don't know why but i didn't feel like sharing my newfound interest to anyone. After like 3 days of stalking this man on social media I ended up telling my cousin about him and she was very pro the idea and she said he was a great guy. Needless to say I found myself searching for this guy (we‚Äôll call him cool guitar boy) everywhere I went. I ended up running into him everywhere, my cousin's school, the store, the solstice festival. The more and more I saw of this guy and his interaction I fell more and more. This went on for a couple of weeks. One day like 4-5 days before i was going to have to fly back to california i was bored and dared to follow him on instagram. I did it. A total of 8 minutes later I got a follow request back. THEN THE NEXT MORNING i got an ad request on snapchat. The only way this man could have gotten my snap was by going through my links on my Insta profile and needless to say I was freaking out. We ended up snapping back and forth and we really hit it off. I really liked him. We talked everyday but it wasn't for very long. Me and him were not really people who could just sit and text forever. I know me personally. I have a major problem when it comes to responding to people. I go through this month-long thing twice a year specifically where I ghost every single person I have ever met including Cassidy as much as she is my best friend. Anyways, we talk and I tell him about how I'm not living on island but I have plans to move here. We ended up making plans to hang out the next time that I'm on the island which would be 5 months later in november. I go back to California and we still continue to talk. Then later the texting everyday turns to a phone call once a week or so. Then all of a sudden we pretty much stopped talking all together besides the occasional call every couple of weeks and I was insanely sad. I understood though school had just started back up again and we were both extremely busy people. Now at school everything was bland at first there was nothing I could do but swoon over the idea of getting the heck out of that place. Then I started noticing this one guy, we'll call him Mini Coach (he does track with me and very oddly looks like my coach), and started to take an interest in me I guess. He was in my friend group so he was kinda always around and eventually me and him got really close. I could tell that he liked me and I started to grow tiny feelings for him but the cool guitar boy always lingered in the back of my mind. This guy was INCREDIBLY sweet like literally the sweetest guy ever. He was funny and awesome and I genuinely did start to like him. He brought me coffee he made at home really early one day because I had said I was tired. He brought me medicine when I started feeling sick. He went to all of my home matches for tennis, he tried to hang out with me all the time after school. He had good grades and though he didn't have a clear goal for his future he knew he wanted to do something. He was amazing. Something I have started to pick up on though is that me and him have some completely different opinions on things. Things that I kind of hold as a big part of who I am. For instance sometimes he likes to make some extremely rude jokes and a lot of the flirting he does involves him kinda being mean to me. He also seems to be wayyy more how do i put this like republican and such (not to be getting political). He just doesn't hold a lot of the same values as me. He is still a really great guy though. He had just gotten out of a relationship over the summer with this girl who broke up with him after 8 months because ‚Äúshe didn't want to keep leading him on‚Äù. I know AWFUL. He at first always used to respond but as time went on he too was always busy and didn't really have time to respond. I also found that every time I'm with him he tries to make advances on me in ways i dont really want and also makes me think that he only likes me for my looks or body. I really like this guy I really do but something about it is off. Im happy and i could see myself with him but‚Ä¶ in the back of my mind Cool Guitar boy kind of lingers. Anyways November arrives and with it my official first hang out with cool guitar boy. I was soooo nervous to actually meet this guy full on. Sure I had been texting him for a while and I had seen him out and about but I had never sat down and had a conversation with the man. Umm so i went and met him‚Ä¶ it started at 5pm and i went home at 3am. WE TALKED FOR 10 HOURS STRAIGHT. That's so odd to me. I have never talked to anyone for as long ever.  I know it's hard to believe that he didn't try to pull anything but seriously he never did it was just pure conversation. We could talk about anything: school, friends, life, parents. Heck we even got into deep conversation. Me and him had the same favorite hobbies and we both liked the same music, though there were still some things we agreed on like whether v8 was good or not (it is). It was something I felt I couldn't do with anyone else including Mini Coach. We just had a real connection, pure and true. There is no other way to describe it. He gifted me this bunny stuffed animal that he had gotten from me for my birthday the month before while he was in Europe over the summer. I was shook. After that night me and him agreed to see each other a month later when i was on island for christmas break again and that was that. I went back to California and from there my dilemma only continued. Cool guitar boy would send me song recommendations that were absolutely fire and we'd have 5 minute conversations maybe twice in the time that I was back in Cali before Christmas break. While i was in Cali though me and Mini Coach got closer too, it was different but that doesn't mean it wasn't nice. Me and the mini coach really were really good friends and I do have feelings for him. I just don't know if they are as strong or the same as what I feel for a cool guitar boy. Mini coach made me happy and I know that's stupid. We got along really well. Yet still i found myself counting down the days until i went back to the island to see Cool Guitar boy. Finally the day came and I was back on the island. I got invited to go and watch one of Cool Guitar Boy‚Äôs band performances and I was ECSTATIC. I went and holy shit they were good. Like really good. HE was really good. After his band's part and when the other band went up he went and sat by me to watch the other performances with my cousin and i. It was one of the best times of my life. The next day I agreed to go on a date with him and he had made reservations for us at this restaurant and it was a really good time. I then went back with him to his house and we made sugar cookies and talked and watched polar express. Overall it was a reallyyy good time. Now Cool Guitar Boy wasn't perfect though. Though he was basically everything I was looking for in a person and had all of the same ideals as me there were still flaws. For starters I had found out that he does partake in drugs and things like shrooms. That doesn't seem very big but it was something that to me previously I would have never even considered talking to a guy that did it. He'd gone to parties and things like that and i didnt think that was something I was interested in. The thing that kept me going though was that I recognized that he never once did any of that stuff around me and it wasn't something he did all the time. I also talked with my aunt about it and she made me realize that it's something that most people try in their lives especially at our age (17) and profiling him because of this wasn't fair. He also didn't have the top grades in his class though he was passing. He had a job though and actually pursued his interests like his band which I genuinely valued. He had a clear goal with his life filled with passion in wanting to go into movie writing and directing which I found really cool. I love people that have a passion. He had flaws but it was stuff I thought I could work with. Me and him had a connection that I would put more on par with me and Cassidy's. I felt like I could talk to him about anything and never be judged. It was deeper. With Mini Coach I liked being around him and I guess I liked the way he cared for me. I never felt like we could have those deep talks though and sometimes, though I hate to say it, I was afraid to speak my mind around him because I thought he'd judge me. Me and Mini Coaches' connection was more surface level but me and Cool Guitar Boys felt more below the surface. My biggest problem is that I'm content in california. My relationship with my dad is good. My school is hard but I'm ok. There my connection with my step mom is not very good though. I feel like I'm always having to suppress who I am. I'm fine and everything is going good but in my heart and in my soul I'm so lost. I don't know who i am and i'm afraid if i don't make any changes to try and find out I never will. I don't like change though. I'm scared of the unknown and part of me would rather just live a mediocre life for the rest of my existence only because of the fact that I don't know the outcome of my decision. My life in california is good but i can't shake the thought in the back of my brain that if i left it could be greater. My problems when facing these decisions are that my dad is wealthy, he leads a good life and he has a respectable job. Me and him are great on a personal level. His wife is partially the problem; she hates me even if she won't show it. I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells around her. She is stuck in this highschool mean girl mentality and I don't get it. When I am with them I am only judged and feel like I have to fit into this box of who they want me to be. I don't have any real family in California besides my sister who lives 3 hours away and I never see, and my step moms family. I am not connected with my step moms family at allll i met them when I was in the 7th grade just after I had just gotten kicked out of my ex step moms family and so I never grew up with them. On the island though, my mom is poor. I mean like really poor. And she honestly has a lot of problems. She has faced problems with drugs and alcohol that she has mostly gotten over.  She is not in the best spot and never really has been. Part of that came from when she was with my dad and their whole divorce and having to watch as one by one all of her kids went to my dad. She also doesn't have the best relationship with my siblings. In fact she and my sister aren't talking at all. Even with all this though I recognize that I have never really gotten to know my mom and part of me wants to try. I know that if I come here she won't change but I think I can handle that. I have far more actual family on the island as well and countless support nets. My grandparents that live here are also starting to get really old and I want to be able to know them more. The reason I was in cali in the first place was because my mom wasn't in a good place and because I had family there. I no longer have family in cali besides my dad and my step brother. I'm 17 and a junior in highschool and if I were to move it would be moving for my senior year when I'm 18. I acknowledge all of my moms flaws and all the things I would have to face by living here and yet part of me still thinks it would be worth it to try. I'm almost an adult and I frankly want to know who I am before I'm forced into the world. I want to branch out and experience the duality of my parents' two lives before I'm on my own. My dad is rich and with him I get whatever I want. With my mom she is poor and I would have to learn new skills like budgeting. Hell, I only learned how to do the laundry last year because I have never had to do anything for myself. I need those experiences. Another worry for me would be in the court. I don't know how I would even go about making the change. Would they even allow it? I mean they have to because I'm almost 18 and per court order I have been allowed to choose since I was 13. But also I have a huge fear of how my dad would react. It would absolutely break his heart. At the same time it doesn't shake this want. I can't stop thinking, is it worth me possibly failing and falling on my butt to find myself when I am perfectly comfortable as I am now? Overall I'm just really scared of regretting the decision I make.  I really don't want not going out of fear to be something that I regret for the rest of my life. So yeah I'm in quite the pickle. I don't know what I should do in both situations. Do I follow my brain and stay in california and choose Mini Coach or my heart and take the leap moving to the island and choose Cool Guitar Boy.

Our main priorities are that it makes coffee fast, is accessible for someone with a wrist injury, can make two cups together or in quick succession, easy to clean and reset after use, and tastes okay.

Standard for ""accessible"": one of us can't tighten screws/bolts all the way due to wrist pain and has to sub in the other to finish the job. Ideally both of us would be able to use the new coffee maker. 

Standard for ""easy to clean"": a plunger is too much cleaning. 

Standard for ""tastes okay"": Jed's bean bags taste like old cigarettes in dish water. 

Based on previous posts in this sub, the Aeropress or gold filter both sound like options. But I'm having trouble finding information about capacity, how much cleaning is needed, or how much physical force it takes to make them work. ",1,1735172411.0,Wellington,7,1.0,False

How Can I Not Help You?,"Welcome to java jam, the coffee shop where nothing makes sense and that's just how it is. We're here to serve you the best coffee in the whole damned city...actually, not exactly. We don't serve anything correctly, but we try our best because you're here, you came in, let's begin, right? Welcome! Oh, I'm sorry about the creepy fog, it's the steam from the machines as we keep those things running all day 24/7, some of the steam is a bit too enthusiastic and gets into the people's coffee and they drink it with strange things happening to them, if you know what I mean. What can I do you for?

You don't know what you want? That's fine, don't worry too much about it, you can choose between size number one, three, or fifty something, it's coffee! It's juice! Honestly, if we're being honest here, I don't even know what those sizes actually are. You could ask me for something, anything, but I might not know what it is you're talking about. I'd just throw you a cup and say ""now here's the special order, TRY SOME"". It's a surprise every single time and every single drink is nothing short of a big ol' mystery as well as the sensation of trying to get it. Did you want lemonade or tea? Oh, we don't really do those things in the traditional sense. We gotta do them the java jam way. It's our special practice. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you'll think it's the worst thing this side of the universe. You know, I don't really get what's going on around here most of the time.

Menu's on the wall, scary's on his way, the words are all on it, but they're all messed up and rearranged, so you'll be seeing stuff like ""apocatus"" and ""evenstine"", maybe some are even spelled backwards, forwards, oh, that's right. You wanted coffee? I don't think you said that correctly. You wanted coconut milk, or is that just something your stupid brain told you to ask for because you think you're such a good guy? We don't have that! We never had anything like that before! We don't have coconut milk, oat milk, dairy milk, or any kind of milk. We lean into the philosophy of milk as a conceptual thing here. You just don't get it. You just had to BE here. If you ask me for something specific, I might stare at you blankly for a short moment and then slowly hand you a cup filled with something that may or may not - by definition - be what you actually asked for.

Do you need a muffin with your nothing order? We don't have those things either. What we've got are things that look like muffins...muffin-ish objects. They might look like them, they might not, in an existential sense, maybe, who knows? You might eat it and experience a muffin or just take a single bite and experience *confusion*. We're not big on definitions in java jam, and don't even get me started on the music. Oh, and the music. It‚Äôs always the same song. Always. We don‚Äôt know why. We don‚Äôt question it. Maybe you‚Äôll like it. Maybe you‚Äôll hate it. But either way, it‚Äôs there, and you can‚Äôt escape it. It‚Äôs like the air here. You breathe it in, and you deal with it.

And if you‚Äôre in a rush, you‚Äôre going to love it here. We‚Äôve perfected the art of waiting. You‚Äôll wait, and then you‚Äôll wait some more. I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm behind the counter, and I‚Äôm definitely not helping you in the way you expected. You might think you‚Äôre waiting for a drink. But maybe the drink is waiting for you. Or maybe none of this exists, and we‚Äôre all just a figment of the steam. Who‚Äôs to say? Can I help you with anything else? Do you need some napkins? We have some, but they‚Äôre the kind of napkins that exist only when you need them the least. So, if you ask for a napkin, you might get a tiny scrap of something that feels like a napkin. Or you might just get a piece of paper that says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, we don‚Äôt have napkins, but we have an abundance of **C R E A M**.‚Äù

At Java Jam, we don‚Äôt help. And that‚Äôs the best part. Because sometimes not helping is the most help you can get.",1,1735172393.0,shortstory1,0,1.0,False

 Been getting thoughts, not too great thoughts but rather odd thoughts. almost like I triggered something? my mental health feels like i accidentally let go of something. My usual amount of coffee is 1-2 cups a week, not on consecutive days, but recently i was drinking daily and then a few days ago I just stopped.

Its like stopping coffee slowly lets back in some odd thoughts. I'm going to try and push through it, but its like I quit and after a few days(I still drink tea), i'm going back to feeling things around me i cant see and my thoughts loose controll and flutter off slowly my mind thinks to stop recognizing them as my own, just everything snowballing together but this time slightly faster than before? (only quit for 3-ish days, not 2)

The thoughts ive been getting are weird, along the lines of ""theres thoughts imbedded in those square shaped things"" or ""something is watching you very quietly, you can barely tell its there, all it does is watch and observe you. "" or ""youre pulled back into some program to observe you and most of the population is just a base/untested group while you are being pulled back into some sort of observatory isolation thing.

Some weird ""i feel something in the room"" is back and i can feel it, with that usually being something spiritual I suppose, too much coffee and i get kinda paranoid thoughts like ""so and so is 100% covering up a crime and lying to me, or those papers laying there will show proof of something shady"". Idk if its 100% corrolated to coffee but coffee seems to make it worse(thus I should quit entirely, but I have adhd and occasional coffee helps me focus).

Like I got pulled back into something, going to just quit coffee for a week or two and maybe i just need to keep going at quitting it. My sense of time is awful so maybe im mistaken in what corrolates with what.

I work in Wilmette and my partner‚Äôs work is relocating to Aurora in spring/summer of 2025.  Our budget is around 500k.  We are in our early thirties.  We hope to start a family soon.  We have a Labrador retriever.  We enjoy going out to eat, wineries/breweries, theater shows, and forest preserves.  I am personally hoping for a suburb with a cute downtown that offers great Pilates and Yoga studios, boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants.  In addition some book clubs and groups to join so that I can have some female friendships.  Somethings important to my partner are for there to be a sense of community, bars/restaurants, it is walkable and safe.  He would prefer for his commute to be around 30 minutes.  I am willing to be a bit more flexible and drive further if need be.  I am finding it a little tricky to find suburbs that make sense for both of us commute wise.

I have been a single parent for over 15 years raising 3 boys pretty much on my own. My family very much looked down on the fact that I wasn‚Äôt married and dint have a degree. So I went to University and 
studied for 7 year‚Äôs and finally graduated with Masters in Music and I work full time. 

I‚Äôm been in a blended relationship with my youngest sons father for 7 years and we live separately now  so I still feel like I‚Äôm a single parent cause blended relationship cause us to split for a year when we lived together, but now we are back together. However this dint help the opinion of my family.


However I thought this would make my family respect me as as I have a partner and a steady job and accept me and ultimately like me more, however I couldn‚Äôt ask my mom to baby sit or meet me for a coffee yet  my sister with all her  partners family support gets my mom baby sitting her child.

They organise family trips to Byron, dinner dates and lunch‚Äôs together and never invite me. I‚Äôm lucky to see my mom once every 6 months yet we live in the same state and my sister visits from interstate and sees her more frequently. 
I should also mention my family is very wealthy from making money on property and because I woke a 9-5 job and not an entrepreneur, they look down on it.

My only peace comes from playing music (busking) on weekends, it makes me forget about the rejection and try and bring some positivity to myself and community.

I‚Äôm trying to be really optimistic and accept that my family don‚Äôt like me for whatever reason, however when Christmas comes, I walk into my mothers home and it‚Äôs really awkward. And to makes matters worse my partners family I‚Äôm not close with. 
So I‚Äôm feeling really lonely and down.
My question is how do I leave my best life knowing that my family dosent like me not matter how nice I am to them.
Do I make my friends my family?

My mother passed when I was just 16, so it's been my dad and me for quite awhile. I have a sister who is 49f and three nieces, but when I visit my dad it tends to be just him and I. My husband (44m) works overnights and comes with me sometimes, but he can't always get the time off, and he had to work Christmas Eve this year, so it's just dad and me. 

My dad and I have a pretty good relationship overall. He supported me through college (both financially & emotionally). I have a lot of good memories with my dad. However, we have vastly different interests and lives. I am a librarian and my dad is a retired police officer. I love reading and ""grandma"" hobbies like baking, reading, crafting. He is a hunting and fishing kind of guy. He lives in a small town I hated growing up in and moved to a city as soon as I could. This is just kind of context for the actual issue.

The thing that exhausts me about visiting him is that *every* choice I make is endlessly interrogated. I don't mean big life choices either. Earlier today I went into the living room and sat on the couch. He asked me why I was sitting there instead of one of the chairs. 

I ate an apple. He asked me why I was eating an apple (I was hungry and wanted some fruit)

We went to my sister's for a bit and we had a couple of mixed drinks. My sister took a picture for her Instagram. My dad asked why (because it's fun??)

I had a cup of coffee this morning. My dad asked why I didn't finish the pot (because I always have just one cup of coffee).

Why did I drive the route I came instead of the one I sometimes take? (Thought the one would have less traffic).

I get that some of this is just making conversation, but the volume is relentlessly. I feel like I have to justify every choice. I love my dad, but I visit less and less because it is just exhausting.

I don't know how to approach this, though. I could mention it to him but this habit is so ingrained I don't know if it would make a difference. I have sometimes tried just answering ""because I wanted to"" which puts a stop to that line of questioning but doesn't really help the overall issue, you know? He's getting older and I want to visit more but I just get so drained. ",2,1735171793.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1hmcc9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hmcc9s/my_completly_implausible_first_day/,My (Completly Implausible) First Day,"I've been meaning to post this here for ages, and Christmas seems like a good enough time. Consider this my Christmas gift to you. This is kind of a wall of text, but I'm hoping it will at least be entertaining enough that SOMEONE will read it all. If you don't like novellas, don't be a hater: it takes 23 muscles to frown, and only three to click the 'close' button and move on.

I'd like to preface this by saying that this might sound implausible. I've read quite a few stories in here, and not a lot of them featured quite this large a set of interconnected clusterfucks all on the same day. Alas, I have no proof, so unless we can find someone else who worked in a small Mexican (hah) restaurant in Princeton, NJ 38.5 years ago, it's unlikely we'll see any proof. So maybe just sit back and enjoy the ride, okay?

So! Back in the summer of (I believe) 1986, I was a young and somewhat baffled 15-year-old, exploring my first summer as a high school student. Naturally I was eager for my first experience in the working world. I had done some computer stuff for my mother, who owned her own business, but that doesn't count of course because I was paid fairly and was not actively abused. So I got a job as a busboy for a little restaurant in Princeton, off the main street, for $5 a day plus ten percent of the tips. Which might not have been bad, evenings, or even lunches when school was in session, but worked out to be about $5.50 an hour, 10 AM (1 hour for pre-cleaning) to 4 PM. And no, the servers weren't ripping me off... much. We rarely had more than one party at a time except from 12 to 1, and then it was only three or four. In the summer, Princeton is *dead,* and I spent about 75% of my time cleaning the place rather than bussing tables. The servers spent about 75% of their time doing nothing at all, but since they were making $2.15 an hour plus no tips, and the place certainly wasn't bumping their pay up to non-server minimum (which was only $3.35 anyway), I guess it was actually sort of reasonable. If depressing.

Anyway. My boss arranged for me to arrive at 9 AM for a one-hour orientation. Got there at 8:50, went and knocked on the back (customer) door, and nobody answered. Sat down on the steps outside the back door and waited until 9, at which time it occurred to me that maybe one of the other doors was open. Went around to the front and knocked, but nobody answered. Went around to the back again and noticed a kitchen door. When I knocked, it just opened, neither locked nor even fully closed. The lights were off inside, and even with the door open it was very dark, so I only took one step inside in order to call out to someone. But before I got to the 'calling out' ... squish. I stepped on some kind of rubber matting, but it was... wet? Like, an inch of water on top of it. Did they, like, flood the kitchen every morning for cleaning or something? I called out, but nobody answered, but I did think I heard some beeping. Beep. Beep. Beep. What in the world.

Needless to say, I had never heard the warning 'disarm me now' beep of burglar alarm before. I had, however, heard the alarm beep of a burglar alarm before. (Do not ask how, because I will not tell you even though the statute of limitations has well and truly passed. Because you will judge me. Which you're already doing. Stop judging me.) So I poked a little further inside, still calling out, when the warning beeps stopped and the alarm began.

Mmhmm. Great. So I sighed, and turned around and sloshed back out the kitchen door and went and sat down on the stairs by the back door and waited. About ten to fifteen minutes later (9:30, by this point) a police car pulled up, and I (as a nice well-dressed skinny nerdy white kid in Princeton) explained what had happened to them, and they laughed and drove away. Your tax dollars at work, folks.

It was not until ten that the manager showed up. I walked up to the back door with him, as he apologized to me about being late and I apologized to him about setting off the burglar alarm. He seemed amused. That lasted another two or three minutes, until, while he was turning on the lights in the bar and dining room area, I asked him why the kitchen was flooded with water.

While I probably would have traded it for an extra $20 or so at the time, I have to admit that the manager's expression has stayed with me over the years in a way that money never seems to.

We sprinted back to the kitchen, and what to our wondering eyes should appear but a kitchen floor that was under two inches of greasy, disgusting, foul water. The rubber mats were those perforated ones that are an inch thick, and they were still sub-marine. My boss stood there hyperventilating for a few moments, and at that moment one of the kitchen staff opened the kitchen door, stepped inside, and recoiled as if bitten by a rattlesnake, swearing fluently in at least three languages, including, apparently, Klingon.

Okay. So apparently this isn't how they wash the floors. The more you know! My boss called the plumbers, and started filling me in on how to clean the dining area. It was there that I met the other folks on duty for the day shift that day: Jeff, a black dude who was probably the nicest person at the restaurant. (But who, a few weeks later, would tell me that he had two girlfriends and that I would probably never have sex with anyone except the woman I married, starting on my wedding day. When I attended my first bisexuals-only orgy, I thought of Jeff. I am fairly sure he wouldn't have appreciated that, but I did. Hi, Jeff!) Carl, the day bartender, a very, very depressed tee-totaler. The kitchen staff, an impenetrable wall of three Mexican-American men who, I found out later, did indeed speak entirely fluent English. They just didn't speak English *to me.* And, of course, John, my boss, who was actually, somehow, a decent person. A person who really didn't deserve his remarkable run of bad luck, culminating in August with him walking out at the end of his shift into a rainstorm, and walking back in two minutes later, eyes wide and face pale, and wailed, '...a TREE... fell on my NEW CONVERTIBLE'.

Plumbers got there within fifteen minutes (it turns out that it's the slow season for everybody) and started poking around. I periodically took a little break from cleaning to watch their progress (did I mention skinny nerdy white kid?) so I was watching when they climbed out of the crawlspace under the kitchen, chattered with one another for a minute, and then, instead of clearing the drains, proceeded to just drill a bunch of holes in the floor so all the water drained down into the crawlspace. This didn't seem entirely sanitary to me, but I'd learned to my cost that the only adults that really listened to me were my mother and one or two of my teachers, and even them only sometimes, so I shrugged and kept it to myself. Hey, at least it meant we opened up at noon. And got to serve BOTH of the parties that came in for lunch.

After that, there were really only three other things of note that day:

\* We needed to make some tortilla chips,so I was sent over to 'the bin' to pull out some already-cut-up tortillas. Not only were they already cut up, they were even pre-molded! I brought a handful of them to the kitchen guys and tried to communicate the fact that all the available stock had spots of mold on them, via the three words of Spanish I knew plus charades and a smidge of interpretive dance. (In retrospect, this might have been what convinced them to not admit to speaking English to me the entire time I worked there, so that what started as a one-day practical joke went on for three months.) The most impenetrable of the back-house staff, who was six feet three if he was an inch and nearly half as wide, rolled his eyes, took the chips, and threw them in the fryer. I discovered that the mold fries up to little black spots on the chips that customers never noticed. And that there were only two days a week when the chips did not have these little spots. I haven't eaten a lot of tortilla chips since.

\* At about 1 PM, I thought, 'gee, haven't I heard that song before'? Yes. Yes I had. As it turned out, the restaurant had exactly one tape of licensed music that it could legally play. One *eight-track* tape. One *sixty-minute* eight-track tape. I remember it had You're Only Human and Pressure (both by Billy Joel) on it, because I had actually liked those songs, before being scarred for life. I do still remember all the lyrics, even though I have heard neither one since 1986.

\* At about 3:45, fifteen minutes before I got through for the day, was the final indignity. The kitchen door swung both ways (like me, although I hadn't figured that out yet at that point), and just inside the kitchen next to it was the area where we dropped dirty dishes. Happily, it was on the non-door side, so at least we didn't get whacked in the ass by the door every time someone came into the kitchen. And everyone was pretty well practiced in yelling 'gangway' when we were going through the door, so there were no door-related injuries the entire time I worked there, at least during my shifts. Well, I was emptying dishes and I heard the dinner waitress (who had just taken over for Jeff) sing out, ""Gangway!"" in her cheerful voice. Then, ""Behind you!"" which, well, she was, so I said, ""Okay!"" And then ""Oops!"" and then about half a pot of scalding hot coffee went down my back. I ripped all the buttons off of my button-down shirt, and still ended up with first degree burns down most of my back, with a couple of blistered spots too.

I washed off the shirt and drove home with a soaking wet buttonless button-down draped over my stinging back, having made an awesome $32 (before taxes). My mother listened to my description of my first day of work, minus the interesting curse words I'd learned from the unfortunate kitchen incident, and then said, cheerfully, ""Well, you got all the bad stuff out of the way today, so tomorrow should be fine."" I got back to work tomorrow, and John told me, ""I *really* wasn't expecting to see you again.""

I stuck it out for the full three months, and then determined never to work in food service again, and to always overtip, two promises that I have by and large kept faithfully all the way through today.",11,1735171665.0,TalesFromYourServer,1,1.0,False

So over holidays I came back home to family, which is 20 min from her place. We finally organise a day to meet for coffee, which was 3 days away. 

We end up meeting for coffee and we ended up talking for almost 5 hours. It was perfect. After I drop her off, she says she has a great time, and so did I. She texts me right away after as well saying the same thing again. We chat later and we decide to meet up again for coffee the next day. (Keep in mind that this town were in is verrrry small so there's nothing else to really do)

We have now made plans to drive a bit out of town for a dinner together, and trying to decide what to do for the next day that we plan to spend time together.

I'm not used to getting past the first date, so I'm having troubles deciding on how to further things. We've been texting in total for about 2 hours each day since we met up, which would be about 5 or 6 days. Our conversations have been great, and starting to get a bit flirty, her texting saying I'm cute, me texting how I really like spending time with her and how I don't mind taking time out of my holidays to see her. 

I think it's clear that she and I both like each other, but I'm unsure what to kinda do now. I feel like on one of our next dates, I should give her a hug, or maybe even a kiss? But I'm unsure when the right time to kiss is? Too fast? And also I've seen some people say I should just ask if she would be interested in being in a relationship, but then that just feels kinda bland and straightforward? But then if I don't ask her outright, how do I show that I want to date her?

I currently have a Chemex pour over paired with a Baratza Encore. Now I am looking to get into the espresso world. After a 2 year research , decided to pull the trigger on the Lelit Mara X + Eureka Mignon Libra after a trip to the Seattle Coffee Gear shop locally. However I now I am having second thoughts as that would be too ‚Äúpro‚Äù set up for me. So now I am thinking of ‚Äúdowngrading‚Äù to Profitec Go after reading some of the posts about 1st espresso machines and the price value proposition of the Profitec Go. 

My basic needs would be 1 or 2 milk based drinks everyday or pure espresso shots. I was after PID, E61 group head, flow control etc but a good one would be > 2K for the machine itself. So dropped that idea. Also those E61 group heads would also take 20-30 minutes to warm up which might not be something I would like to wait on everyday. I know I have smart plug which can  mitigate that issue to some extent. But I am thinking of being more practical than running after that ‚Äúprecision‚Äù in stability which I might not realize as I am beginning this journey. 

Please let me know if I am making the right choice here or should I stick to Lelit Mara X or another HX machine which PID , E61 group head etc. 

Also please advise what would be a good espresso grinder for the remainder of the budget. I was demo‚Äôd the Eureka Libra which I loved but that price is too steep for removing the extra step of weighing your grind. Is the Eureka Mignon Specialita that good and worth the price ? I like the advantage of directly being able to set the portafilter on to it.

My brother and I both chipped in to get our dad a new phone for the holidays, and my brother said I could keep the gift card.

A few weeks later I had a random thought that I could use the gift card funds to try out one month of Bumble Premium. I had never really had much luck on dating apps, maybe one dinner/coffee date every few months, but never anything that went anywhere. But since the month of premium would essentially be free, I figured there‚Äôd be no harm in trying it out.

For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know, one of the things you can do with Bumble Premium is make it so that the app promotes your profile and puts you at the top of other users‚Äô stacks for like 30 minutes once a week. You can also see who has swiped right for you right away and don‚Äôt have to swipe all day looking for them. Well the first time I ever activated that 30 minute boost feature I got one like.

The beans are from Royal Coffee. It was their ORGANIC KONGA TAKELE MAMMO DENBI NATURAL ‚Äì 33394

Description: This is a minimal intervention natural coffee, a Yirgacheffe district coffee from Ethiopia, produced by Takele Mammo Denbi, the former managing director of the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers‚Äô Cooperative Union. It is certified organic. 
The flavor profile is fruit-forward without being overt, and delicately floral and clean. We taste a range of jammy fruits like blackberry, grape, and raspberry, with hints of lemongrass, lavender, and hibiscus.

But how can an individual evaluate which treatment to pursue? Here are some key factors to consider:

- **Authenticity:** Genuine before and after photos are critical. Consumers should look for markers of authenticity, such as consistent lighting and angles in the images. Photos that appear overly edited can spark doubt and skepticism.
- **Source:** The trustworthiness of the source matters. Pictures from reputable dentists or clinics establish credibility. It is wise to consider reviews or testimonials alongside these images to paint a complete picture of the service.
- **Context:** Some before-and-after images are shared without context, such as the duration of treatment or specific techniques used. Understanding the details behind the transformation enriches the consumer‚Äôs perspective and helps set realistic expectations.
 
The emotional impact of these images cannot be overemphasized. A relatable story often accompanies stunning visuals, enhancing its effect on the viewer. Many brands use customer testimonials or transformation stories to heighten engagement. When potential patients see someone who once felt insecure now smiling brightly, it creates a desire for a similar experience.

Social media platforms amplify the influence of before-and-after pics of teeth whitening. Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok are flooded with transformations that go viral, attracting attention and encouraging discussions.

It‚Äôs essential to recognize that the impact of these pictures is twofold. While they can drive consumer engagement and lead to purchases, they can also create unrealistic expectations. When individuals view glossy images of dazzling smiles, they might assume their results will mirror those in the photo. This can result in disappointment if their outcomes differ. Thus, practitioners must manage expectations by explaining what is achievable.

**To mitigate unrealistic expectations:**

 Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Discuss individual differences: Results can vary based on several factors, including dental health, the severity of staining, and the whitening method used.
- Educate about procedures: Clear communication about the process behind the treatment helps consumers understand their particular journey.
- Encourage realistic goals: Emphasizing that each person‚Äôs smile is unique can help frame the narrative around achieving the best version of one‚Äôs teeth rather than an unrealistic ideal.
 
Before and after pics of teeth whitening wield significant influence over consumer choice. They highlight possibilities, generate excitement, and open avenues for discussions about oral health and aesthetics. However, it is crucial to approach these images with an informed perspective. Doing so allows individuals to achieve their desired results without falling victim to overly ambitious expectations. Ultimately, the right blend of visual appeal and educational context assures consumers can make choices that align with their goals.

My mom is supportive and abusive at the same time?,"Hi, this is so hard for me to express. (Sorry if my English is broken btw, it‚Äôs my third language). Since I have memory my mum has 2 sides. On one hand she listens to me and supported me (I studied art because of her, she always believed in me to became an artist and now I am achieving my dream step by step and she is always there economically or looking for opportunities for me, presents that she knows I will like etc). This 2 last years went to the psyquiatric and has a new med that makes her feeel like a normal person in the day by day, but since I was a kid she has been really emotional abusive and violent with me. I went to therapy with my money (she doesn‚Äôt believe in psychotherapy and the only reason she went to a psyquiatric is because the doctor took her because of her blood results, but I don‚Äôt know her diagnose because she doesn‚Äôt want to tell me, she only says she was a very happy woman but me and my father make her abusive and violent). I went to therapy at 25 years old because when I was like 16-17 I started to not feel half of my body and sometimes I fell down in the streets or wherever I was. One day it happened hard and she took me to urgency doctor. They told me it was generalized anxiety disorder and she lied telling the doctors It was because of my exams (it was because of her). The ride home she was insulting and yelling me because ""I made her loose time only because anxiety""). If I am bad she is worse and because of me. She is ill because of me and my father and sometimes grandad. I know she feels so alone and my dad is emotionally unapproachable and never took care of her since I have memory, but she is really really violent. Even if you don‚Äôt know why she is angry, is your problem. She likes to close doors really violently, insult us even if we are in another room, talk about as with repulsion and growl with disgust all the time. All. The. Time. One day when she was really bad I opened my eyes in the middle of the night and she was up, looking  to me with a crazy look on her eyes. Because she was mad I didn‚Äôt wake her up to tell her I came home from a party. (I did but she didn‚Äôt remember, this situations happens a lot). When I made it to go to therapy my psychologist told me I had generalized anxiety disorder but also ADHD ( a really hard one, ) and Post Traumatic Stress syndrome. When I hear an elevator or keys, or things like that I have fear and anxiety. This last 2 years were so calm, because of the meds I told you. But this Christmas I feel she is coming back to the old times and I am loosing my mind. I depend on her and I know when she is good she is so sweet. I wanna know why she is like that, what is happening with her because she is such a good mum but also she abused and abuses me verbally and emotionally. I know it‚Äôs not my fault but it‚Äôs hard. Everything , literally EVERYTHING can make her yell at me or being really violent. If I put 30 secs more a coffee in the microwave she starts insulting me very hard. If I try politely to put some limits, she goes crazy and says I am disrespectful and refuses to talk to me in days, weeks‚Ä¶ last time I had to apologize on my knees literally assuming all the fault even though my sin was believe that the coffe could need 30 more secs. These are day to day examples to make you understand the level of madness because I feel everything I do, everything I need, every question I ask is gonna start a fight. Most of my childhood is empty, never wanted my friends on my house, and with strangers she always is so charming and makes lots of presents and she is so sweet. If someone is coming home or the opposite, the day before is always a nightmare. I don‚Äôt know if you relate with this, I will be so happy to listen to you guys and feel less alone, I feel she looks like a demon but I swear is something mental health related because she is also a good mum? Sounds crazy but is true, she in other ways is better than other mums I see, but then she is the worst emptionally. Idk I have lots of stories coming to my mind, if you need more info you can also ask me, and thanks for reading . Stay safe and I hope you enjoy this days as much as you can üíïüíïüíï

My father was absent and neglectful when I was a child, leaving most of the child rearing to my narcissistic mother. He would barge in only when it was time to take me anywhere or when it was time to dish out a scolding. 

Things have apparently not changed in the slightest even now that I'm 35, almost 36. We've always had a rocky relationship that deteriorated through my adolescence and young adulthood. He started acting like a father for a while when I was 23, when my mother passed due to cancer.

I don't know him and I don't want to know him, not after he repeatedly humiliated me through the years, never offering a helping hand when I needed it, just looking down upon me and making me feel consistently unwelcome. 

And after what happened before our annual family get together I have now realized that I don't want him in my life.

Yesterday when I arrived at his house for Christmas Eve he didn't even say hi, he immediately scolded me for having forgot something at home (I was trying to reach my boss for an important thing related to me taking over my workplace in a few days) and I forgot an inconsequential item at home.
 
Then he doubled down when he said that of the things I had brought him from what he had asked me to have delivered at my place some were for me and I shouldn't have taken them too. We were heading to a large family gathering and I wanted to share (most of them were traditional seasonal sweets and pastries). 

And then he also scolded me when I didn't park my car where he had told me. I didn't even bother trying to tell him that I didn't trust parking my car on a heavily iced inclined parking spot where just a few meters ahead down the road there was a perfectly safe, non iced parking spot. 

He yelled ""do you even listen when I speak to you?"" In front of his partner and my husband, humiliating me like he used to do when I was a child. I almost think he enjoys seeing me cower in front of him. 

Then he gave me the silent treatment for most of the dinner and then today at lunch. I couldn't really stand in his presence a minute more after coffee was served. 

I fear every single chance he comes by, at least twice a week, I loathe the small talk I'm forced to make with him. I dread meeting him, having to juggle my schedules because he is never on time. I'm sure he thinks of me as a failure of a person and regards me as an irresponsible imbecile. He doesn't approve me taking over my current workplace from my boss and he never hid it, even though my boss thinks I'll handle it just fine. For the record, I'm a chef in a long running restaurant and the old owner wants out, due to his old age, and he offered me the ownership for a very favorable and competitive price, a price which me and my husband were able to dish out in full, coming out of the purchase without debits save the monthly rent. 

I thought he was going to be happy for me. That he would approve.

Apparently, being considered trustworthy enough to make it in this world isn't enough for him. 

To him I am unwelcome failure, and I will forever remain so, no matter what I do. ",1,1735169988.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. So, here‚Äôs the situation. I (61M) have always been an avid reader and have a small but beloved collection of books. Some of them are older editions, a little hard to come by, but nothing outragesouly rare. Just books that meen a lot to me.

A few months ago, a friend of mine, ‚ÄúTom‚Äù (55M), expressed interest in borrowing a few of them. I hesitated at first because I‚Äôm protective of my books, but he assured me he‚Äôs carefull with borrowed things. So, I lent him three of my favorites, including a beautifuly bound copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird* that was gifted to me by my late brother.

Fast forward to last week. Tom returned the books, but they were‚Ä¶ not the same. One had a coffee stain that seeped through severel pages, another had the spine badly creased (it had been pristine before), and the dust jacket of *To Kill a Mockingbird* was torn and taped back together.

The worst, though? My copy of *The Lord of the Rings* had a *stain* on it that I can only describe as... intimate. I don‚Äôt want to be graphic, but it was clear what it was, and it made me sick. I couldn't beleive someone would be that careless (or disgussting) with something that didn‚Äôt belong to them.

Here‚Äôs where it gets weirder: When I confronted Tom about everything, he claimed the coffee stain was an accidant and the torn dust jacket was ‚Äúnormal wear and tear.‚Äù Then he tryed to explain the *stain* on *The Lord of the Rings* by saying he‚Äôd been eating turkey leftovers while reading and must have spilled gravy. Except this stain was **very clearly not gravy**. I won‚Äôt go into more detail, but I‚Äôm sure you get the idea.

When I told him I didn‚Äôt buy his turkey excuse and asked why he thought eating over someone else‚Äôs book was okay to begin with, he laffed and said I was being ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù He told me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a book! Chill out!‚Äù

I told him that if he wasn‚Äôt going to respect my belonings, he shouldn‚Äôt have borrowed them in the first place. He got defensive and accused me of being uptight and overly attached to ‚Äúmaterial things.‚Äù Since then, he‚Äôs been giving me the cold sholder and told a mutual friend that I ‚Äúoverreacted over nothing.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I *did* overreact. I know they‚Äôre just books, but to me, they‚Äôre more than that‚Äîthey hold sentimental value. Still, maybe I came off as too harsh?

So, AITA for confronting my friend about the conditon of my books?",4,1735169467.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1hmbitv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hmbitv/deeply_infatuated_with_my_good_friend/,Deeply infatuated with my good friend.,"Over a few years, I have been meeting up with a friend (22f) that I (23m) met at college. Now, we picked different courses, so we don‚Äôt see each other at school, but we maintain regular contact of a minimum of a single meeting per month. While that doesn‚Äôt sound like much, it‚Äôs very meaningful to us because we aren‚Äôt the most social individuals. We created a strong bond of warmth and acceptance. Last month we met up like 3 times probably.  
  
Lately, I began developing strong romantic feelings towards her. I thought it was nothing big at first, so I allowed myself to observe it and let it pass. I‚Äôve been feeling the same way for months now. It feels very real, and she has become a focal point of my life. I feel unhappy without her. I‚Äôm fairly busy, but when I‚Äôm not distracted by school, I keep thinking of her and the fun times we have. I dream of her almost every night; she means the world to me. And I don‚Äôt see myself ever moving on from this. Genuinely, I feel like she‚Äôs one in a million.¬†  
  
So, where is the problem? It lies in the fact that she has a boyfriend, of which I was not aware for the longest time. What makes this situation difficult is that we confide in each other a lot, and we have shared many things. I‚Äôm at a point where I feel like I knew everything about her, except for her relationship. I understand that she doesn‚Äôt need to inform me about it, but since we were really close, I assumed it‚Äôd come up earlier. So, I created a hopeful vision of us together.¬†  
  
What‚Äôs more, we always meet one-on-one. We go to parks, cafes, museums, and artisan stores‚Äîplaces in which I couldn‚Äôt help but think we were moving towards something more. And how nice she is towards me isn‚Äôt helping‚Äîthe adorable gift she gave me‚Ä¶  
  
I wanted to invite her for a date, but during a meeting before that, I learned that she has a boyfriend, and now I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to tell her my intentions. So, I‚Äôm stuck with a note on my phone that I was meant to send her. I was too hesitant to send it earlier, and it came up just before I had the courage to send it. Actually, if it wasn‚Äôt for my curiosity and questions, I still wouldn‚Äôt know about him.¬†  
  
I decided not to tell her how I feel, as I consider that to be immoral and disrespectful. No matter how I phrase it, it‚Äôs going to sound like I want her to leave her boyfriend. But at the same time, I think honesty is something good friendships are built upon, and me staying put and having these intentions feels wrong. Even though I don‚Äôt act on my attraction, sometimes we don‚Äôt have volitional control over everything, and I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt be a good friend.¬†  
  
But I‚Äôm already set in my way of being platonic, and I won‚Äôt change it. Carrying these feelings and having so much ambiguity really hurts. I feel like I‚Äôm becoming monothematic for my friends; I only feel like talking about her.¬†What's more I feel like im lying to her and im dishonest by keeping these things hidden and Im so afraid of coming across like a sly guy-friend waiting for something or wanting to win her over with my kindness which is a result of a genuine friendship...  
  
I‚Äôm really frustrated with the advice I see on the internet or hear from others: to move on, to read about attachment styles, limerence, codependence. To date other people. To get busy with work. To seduce her. What others fail to understand is that, to me, it‚Äôs very real what I‚Äôm feeling, and I can‚Äôt change it (not without years of therapy). I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to move on.¬†And all these labels diminish what I feel. Im no expert to analyse my state. It's just a normal side effect of man-female relationships.    
  
I don‚Äôt want to influence her in a negative way, so I stay put. But sometimes I can‚Äôt help it and invite her for coffee. I‚Äôd love to disappear from her life, but we‚Äôre genuine friends, and she seems happy to meet with me. It‚Äôs not entirely one-sided.¬†  
  
It really sucks. I‚Äôve never felt this way. I‚Äôve had crushes and fascinations, but this‚Äîit‚Äôs so much more because of the long-standing friendship. I consulted a psychologist, and they told me it‚Äôs normal because I‚Äôm in love and I shouldn‚Äôt look for faults.¬†  
  
This desire for my friend took a toll on my mental health. She makes me so happy, and making her laugh is the best. But I can‚Äôt make her laugh too much, because it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs job. And that fucking sucks.¬†  
  
I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. If I distance myself, I hurt her by not being a friend that she clearly likes, and I hurt myself because I enjoy her company. By being close, I propel my suffering too, because I can‚Äôt get enough of her. I‚Äôm genuinely unable to move on. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to let go. Meeting her was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.¬†  
  
I don‚Äôt find other girls interesting or attractive. My heart is occupied. I distract myself with activities, but it doesn‚Äôt solve anything.¬†  
  
Maybe someone can relate or comment about my situation‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what I want from this to be honest. But people here seem to care. And I‚Äôll try to help someone too. How do I go about this? Is telling her really that immoral? keeping it from her also feels wrong and im worried I may act inappropriately one day.

  
TL;DR: I have strong romantic feelings towards my female friend. Im conflicted whether I should tell her or not. Im becoming very preoccupied with her and it's getting hard for me to function. I want to remain friends as the bond is super important, but my heart wants more...",0,1735168958.0,relationships,1,0.25,False

Pinapa labas lang daw nila na sila pa for the sake sa anak (nag confirm sa akin ang baby momma na hindi na sila kasi chinat nya ako eventually). Guy informe me this: hindi sila, baby and the momma used to visit every weekend lang but they moved in together with the guy eventually nung nag lipat sila ng bahay with other people because of renovation.

Girl said this to me: She wants me to stop whatever we have with the guy kasi para daw sa anak nila kawawa anak nila, sinagot niya rin ako na wala na sila, tinanong ako kung may nangyari naba sa amin ni guy (thought this was below the belt, pero di ko alam san sya nang galing bat naitanong nya pero i answered) nalokoka na daw siya di nya alam gagawin. Made a comment ""grabe talaga ang mga lalake noh??"" She said nothing (made me think she knows the guy wasn't at fault). Layuan ko na daw ang guy, sinabi ko OO. 

The next few days mag cha-chat na siya sa akin kung kasama ba kami ni guy, okay lang ba daw kami sa work (almost everyday nya china-chat yan) so feeling ko parang naging ka kontsaba ko siya sa relasyon nila na complicated kaya INGNORED both sila sa akin para di maka disturb sa buhay ko. Pumupunta pa ang guy sa akin pero minsan di ako maka alis kasi nagwo-work ako, dun na siya nag sha-share sa story ba't naging ganon ang situation nila sa girl.

Nagising nalang ako bigla from sleep, then chineck ko yung msgs nila, minura na ako ng babae. Kaya pala nagising ako bigla kasi nag bigay bad vibes na pala. Pinaalis na kasi siya ng lalake pinapauwi na sa kanila (ibang province) tapos na hurt siguro si girl. Then after 2 months naging kami na ni guy hehehehehe.

1hmbfzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hmbfzj/i_need_advise_my_mom_is_supportive_and_abusive_at/,I need advise. My mom is supportive and abusive at the same time?,"Hi, this is so hard for me to express. (Sorry if my English is broken btw, it‚Äôs my third language). Since I have memory my mum has 2 sides. On one hand she listens to me and supported me (I studied art because of her, she always believed in me to became an artist and now I am achieving my dream step by step and she is always there economically or looking for opportunities for me, presents that she knows I will like etc). This 2 last years went to the psyquiatric and has a new med that makes her feeel like a normal person in the day by day, but since I was a kid she has been really emotional abusive and violent with me. I went to therapy with my money (she doesn‚Äôt believe in psychotherapy and the only reason she went to a psyquiatric is because the doctor took her because of her blood results, but I don‚Äôt know her diagnose because she doesn‚Äôt want to tell me, she only says she was a very happy woman but me and my father make her abusive and violent). I went to therapy at 25 years old because when I was like 16-17 I started to not feel half of my body and sometimes I fell down in the streets or wherever I was. One day it happened hard and she took me to urgency doctor. They told me it was generalized anxiety disorder and she lied telling the doctors It was because of my exams (it was because of her). The ride home she was insulting and yelling me because ""I made her loose time only because anxiety""). If I am bad she is worse and because of me. She is ill because of me and my father and sometimes grandad. I know she feels so alone and my dad is emotionally unapproachable and never took care of her since I have memory, but she is really really violent. Even if you don‚Äôt know why she is angry, is your problem. She likes to close doors really violently, insult us even if we are in another room, talk about as with repulsion and growl with disgust all the time. All. The. Time. One day when she was really bad I opened my eyes in the middle of the night and she was up, looking  to me with a crazy look on her eyes. Because she was mad I didn‚Äôt wake her up to tell her I came home from a party. (I did but she didn‚Äôt remember, this situations happens a lot). When I made it to go to therapy my psychologist told me I had generalized anxiety disorder but also ADHD ( a really hard one, ) and Post Traumatic Stress syndrome. When I hear an elevator or keys, or things like that I have fear and anxiety. This last 2 years were so calm, because of the meds I told you. But this Christmas I feel she is coming back to the old times and I am loosing my mind. I depend on her and I know when she is good she is so sweet. I wanna know why she is like that, what is happening with her because she is such a good mum but also she abused and abuses me verbally and emotionally. I know it‚Äôs not my fault but it‚Äôs hard. Everything , literally EVERYTHING can make her yell at me or being really violent. If I put 30 secs more a coffee in the microwave she starts insulting me very hard. If I try politely to put some limits, she goes crazy and says I am disrespectful and refuses to talk to me in days, weeks‚Ä¶ last time I had to apologize on my knees literally assuming all the fault even though my sin was believe that the coffe could need 30 more secs. These are day to day examples to make you understand the level of madness because I feel everything I do, everything I need, every question I ask is gonna start a fight. Most of my childhood is empty, never wanted my friends on my house, and with strangers she always is so charming and makes lots of presents and she is so sweet. If someone is coming home or the opposite, the day before is always a nightmare. I don‚Äôt know if you relate with this, I will be so happy to listen to you guys and feel less alone, I feel she looks like a demon but I swear is something mental health related because she is also a good mum? Sounds crazy but is true, she in other ways is better than other mums I see, but then she is the worst emptionally. Idk I have lots of stories coming to my mind, if you need more info you can also ask me, and thanks for reading . Stay safe and I hope you enjoy this days as much as you can üíïüíïüíï

Plan on just meditation & sleep. I know they have tablets....how do those work? Do you have to pay money to do everything on them or do they have options of free books to read or like podcasts to.listen too. I mostly just care about having books to read.

1hmbdyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Street_Guidance_2825/comments/1hmbdyh/the_secret_to_everlasting_happiness/,The Secret to Everlasting Happiness,"Love is one of life‚Äôs most profound experiences, yet maintaining a thriving relationship requires intention, effort, and understanding. Many couples aspire to build lasting happiness, but what sets the truly happy ones apart? In this guide, we explore ten transformative habits that can elevate your relationship, deepen your bond, and help you unlock love‚Äôs full potential. These insights, rooted in both research and real-life examples, illuminate the path to sustained joy and connection.

# 1. Prioritize Communication

At the heart of every happy couple lies open and honest communication. Partners who thrive share their thoughts, feelings, and concerns without fear of judgment. It‚Äôs not just about talking but also about listening‚Äîreally listening‚Äîwith empathy and understanding. Happy couples carve out time daily to check in with each other, discuss their highs and lows, and ensure they feel heard. This practice builds trust, resolves conflicts effectively, and strengthens the emotional connection.

# 2. Celebrate Small Moments

Happiness isn‚Äôt just about grand gestures; it‚Äôs found in the small, everyday moments. Whether it‚Äôs sharing a laugh over morning coffee, exchanging a quick text during the day, or holding hands on a walk, these micro-moments of connection nurture intimacy. Happy couples express gratitude for the little things their partner does and make an effort to create joyful memories, even in the mundane.

# 3. Show Appreciation and Gratitude

One of the simplest yet most powerful habits is expressing appreciation. Over time, it‚Äôs easy to take your partner for granted, but acknowledging their efforts can reignite feelings of love and respect. Happy couples frequently say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and acknowledge the qualities they admire in their partner. This culture of gratitude fosters positivity and reinforces the bond between them.

# 4. Maintain Physical Affection

Physical touch is a cornerstone of romantic relationships. From hugging and cuddling to holding hands and more intimate moments, physical affection releases oxytocin, the ‚Äúlove hormone,‚Äù which enhances feelings of closeness and security. Happy couples understand the value of touch and make it a priority, even amidst busy schedules. It‚Äôs a silent yet powerful way to communicate love and support.

# 5. Foster Shared Interests

Couples who play together, stay together. Pursuing shared hobbies and interests allows partners to bond over common passions, creating opportunities for collaboration and enjoyment. Whether it‚Äôs cooking, hiking, dancing, or even binge-watching a favorite show, these activities serve as reminders of the joy you share as a team. At the same time, respecting individual interests ensures a balanced relationship where both partners feel fulfilled.

# 6. Navigate Conflict with Respect

Disagreements are inevitable, but how couples handle them makes all the difference. Happy couples don‚Äôt avoid conflict; they face it with mutual respect and a problem-solving mindset. They avoid blame, focus on finding solutions, and understand that it‚Äôs okay to agree to disagree. The ability to apologize sincerely and forgive fully is another hallmark of a thriving relationship. By handling conflicts constructively, they preserve trust and harmony.

# 7. Practice Emotional Support

Life‚Äôs challenges are easier to face with a supportive partner by your side. Happy couples prioritize being there for each other during tough times, offering encouragement, comfort, and reassurance. This emotional support creates a safe space where both partners feel valued and understood. It‚Äôs about being a team, celebrating each other‚Äôs successes, and providing strength during hardships.

# 8. Set Goals Together

A shared vision for the future strengthens a couple‚Äôs connection. Happy partners discuss their dreams, plan their future, and work together to achieve common goals. Whether it‚Äôs buying a home, traveling the world, or starting a family, setting and pursuing these aspirations unites them and keeps the relationship dynamic and forward-looking. Collaboration in goal-setting reinforces the idea that they are building a life together.

# 9. Cultivate Forgiveness

No relationship is perfect, and mistakes are inevitable. Happy couples embrace forgiveness as an essential practice, understanding that holding onto resentment can erode the foundation of their bond. By letting go of past grievances and focusing on the present, they make room for growth and healing. This doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring issues but rather addressing them with compassion and moving forward.

# 10. Prioritize Quality Time

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to let quality time slip away. However, happy couples understand the importance of prioritizing moments together, free from distractions. Whether it‚Äôs a date night, a weekend getaway, or simply cooking dinner together, these moments allow partners to reconnect and reinforce their bond. Quality time is about being present and making each other feel valued and cherished.

# Conclusion: Building a Love That Lasts

Creating a happy, enduring relationship is not about luck; it‚Äôs about cultivating habits that foster love, respect, and understanding. The ten habits outlined above serve as a roadmap for couples seeking to deepen their connection and unlock love‚Äôs full potential. By prioritizing communication, celebrating small moments, and supporting each other through life‚Äôs ups and downs, you can build a relationship that not only survives but thrives. Happiness in love is a journey, and with dedication and effort, it‚Äôs a destination every couple can reach.",1,1735168510.0,u_Street_Guidance_2825,0,1.0,False

It is true that we would have to engineer whatever we put in the atmosphere to be resistant or immune to the effects of sulfuric acid. One solution we can't use on Earth that much is teflon, however there are other materials that aren't as potentially carcinogenic as teflon like just having a thin coat of sulfur on the exterior of objects. It's certainly not an insurmountable challenge. 

Sulfuric acid is just two waters bound with a sulfur atom. Sulfur itself has numerous industrial uses, but all you need is something basic to react the sulfuric acid with or it can be done with electrolysis when in a dilute solution. So you would start with the acid rain add a bit of water as a sort of catalyst and then run electricity through that. The hydrogen and oxygen break free as a gas and then your left with pure sulfur.

Those clouds of acid have coffee in them.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

========================================

Dog lovers will tell you that the bond we share with our four-legged friends is a unique one, filled with moments of joy, playfulness, and, well, the occasional unpleasant odor. One such concern that many dog owners face is bad breath. Let‚Äôs be honest: there‚Äôs nothing quite like the smell of your dog's breath when they greet you after a long day. As much as we adore our furry companions, dealing with their stinky breath can be a real downer. That's why today, we're diving deep into the world of professional dog bad breath tools. So, grab your favorite cup of coffee, and let‚Äôs chat about some effective solutions to combat this canine conundrum!

Understanding Dog Bad Breath: Why It Happens
--------------------------------------------

Before we jump into the tools available for managing your dog's bad breath, it‚Äôs important to understand why it occurs in the first place. Bad breath, or halitosis, can stem from various causes ranging from dental issues to dietary habits.

### Common Causes of Bad Breath in Dogs

1. **Dental Disease**: The most common culprit of bad breath is dental disease. Plaque and tartar buildup on the teeth can lead to gingivitis and periodontal disease, both of which create foul odors.
2. **Diet**: Just like humans, dogs are what they eat. Certain diets, especially those high in protein or made up of low-quality ingredients, can contribute to bad breath.
3. **Health Issues**: Medical conditions such as kidney disease, diabetes, or infections can result in halitosis. If your dog‚Äôs breath suddenly changes or has an unusual odor, it might be time for a vet visit.
4. **Oral Hygiene**: Simply put, just as we need regular brushing and flossing, dogs require good oral hygiene to maintain fresh breath.
5. **Foreign Objects**: Sometimes, dogs get curious and chew on things they shouldn‚Äôt. This could lead to something stuck in their teeth causing bad breath.

Recognizing these factors can help you decide on the best tools to tackle that stinky breath head-on.

The Importance of Fresh Breath for Your Dog
-------------------------------------------

So, why should you care about your dog‚Äôs breath? Well, aside from the obvious social implications (no one wants to be the owner of the dog that clears a room!), fresh breath indicates better overall health. Maintaining your dog's oral hygiene can prevent serious conditions that could lead to more significant health issues down the line. After all, wouldn‚Äôt you rather prevent problems before they arise?

How to Choose the Right Tools for Your Dog's Bad Breath
-------------------------------------------------------

When considering professional dog bad breath tools, it's essential to weigh several factors:

1. **Effectiveness**: Look for tools that have been proven to reduce plaque and tartar buildup effectively.
2. **Safety**: Ensure the product is safe for your dog, devoid of harmful chemicals or ingredients.
3. **Ease of Use**: Some products may require more effort to use than others. Choose something convenient that fits your lifestyle.
4. **Vet Recommendations**: Don't overlook the value of advice from your vet. Often, they'll have insights into which products work best for your specific dog breed or age group.

With these factors in mind, let's explore some top-notch tools designed to combat your pup's bad breath!

Top Tools for Tackling Dog Bad Breath
-------------------------------------

Now that we understand the causes and importance of managing bad breath, let's dive into some professional dog bad breath tools. Each tool plays a unique role in promoting your dog's oral health and ensuring their breath remains fresh.

### 1. Dental Chews

#### Why They Work

Dental chews are like the treats with a purpose! Designed specifically to reduce tartar and plaque while your dog chews them, they can also stimulate saliva production, which naturally helps clean teeth.

#### Recommended Brands:

- **Greenies Original Dental Treats**: Highly palatable and effective, they come in various sizes suitable for any pup.
- **Whimzees Natural Dog Chews**: These quirky-shaped chews not only reduce bad breath but keep your dog entertained!

### 2. Water Additives

#### Keep It Fresh

Water additives are a fantastic way to incorporate better oral hygiene directly into your dog's routine. Just add these liquids to your dog's drinking water to help reduce plaque and freshen breath.

#### Recommended Options:

- **Vet‚Äôs Best Enzymatic Dog Toothpaste Water Additive**: A vet-approved formula that effectively combats bad breath.
- **TropiClean Fresh Breath Clean Teeth Gel**: Not just for prevention, this gel also promotes overall dental health.

### 3. Toothbrush and Toothpaste

#### Brush It Off

Just like us, dogs benefit significantly from regular brushing. Using specially designed dog toothbrushes and toothpaste can work wonders for battling bad breath.

#### Recommended Products:

- **PetSmile Professional Dog Toothpaste**: Vet-approved and safe for dogs, this toothpaste doesn‚Äôt foam, making it easy for your dog.
- **Nylabone Advanced Oral Care Dog Toothbrush**: Comes with two heads for different sized mouths, ensuring every pup gets a good clean.

### 4. Oral Sprays

#### Quick Fixes

For situations that require immediate action (like when company‚Äôs coming over), oral sprays can be a game-changer. A quick spray can help freshen your pup's breath on-the-go.

#### Suggested Brands:

- **Vetoquinol Virbac C.E.T. Dog Toothpaste Spray**: A practical solution for those who struggle with brushing.
- **TropiClean Fresh Breath Oral Care Spray**: Easy to use and provides instant freshness.

### 5. Dental Wipes

#### Swipe Away the Grime

If your dog isn‚Äôt a fan of traditional brushing but still needs dental care, dental wipes are an excellent alternative. They help remove plaque and debris from your dog's mouth without the fuss of a toothbrush.

#### Popular Choices:

- **Pura Naturals Pet Organic Dental Wipes**: Made from natural ingredients, they‚Äôre safe and effective.
- **Vet‚Äôs Best Dental Wipes**: Easy to use and effective for maintaining oral hygiene.

### 6. Professional Cleaning Tools

#### Go Pro!

If home solutions aren't cutting it, a professional cleaning may be in order. Regular vet visits can ensure your dog's teeth and gums stay healthy.

#### What to Expect:

- **Scaling and Polishing**: Just like at your dentist, this process removes tartar and polishes the surfaces of the teeth.
- **X-rays**: To check for any underlying issues, x-rays may be needed during your vet visit.

Integrating Bad Breath Tools into Your Routine
----------------------------------------------

Maintaining your dog‚Äôs oral hygiene doesn‚Äôt have to be a chore. Here are some tips to seamlessly incorporate these tools into your daily routine:

### Establish a Schedule

Consistency is key! Set a schedule for brushing or using dental products. Whether it‚Äôs daily, bi-weekly, or weekly, sticking to a plan will help keep your pup‚Äôs breath fresh.

### Make It Fun

Turn oral care into a bonding experience! Use treats as rewards after a brushing session or make it part of playtime. Your dog will associate the routine with positive experiences.

### Monitor Progress

Keep track of your dog‚Äôs breath and overall dental health. If you notice persistent bad breath despite your best efforts, consulting your vet for further evaluation is essential.

Conclusion: Fresh Breath, Happy Pup!
------------------------------------

Bad breath in dogs may seem like an insurmountable problem, but with professional dog bad breath tools and a bit of commitment, it‚Äôs entirely manageable! By understanding the causes, exploring various tools, and establishing a consistent routine, you'll ensure your dog's breath is as pleasant as can be.

1hmb373,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmb373/aitah_for_feeling_my_mother_ruined_christmas_and/,"AITAH for feeling my mother ruined christmas and next year she should only come for either the eve or day, not both?","I (40f) made christmas plans with my parents (66f) (68m)for them to come over for both Christmas eve and Christmas day. Christmas day they would stay until 3 pm because they had a 3 and a half hour ride home.  

A few days before christmas eve my sister (33f) (we haven't been on best terms) asked my mother what her plans were. My mother told me, so despite our strained relationship (figured it's time to let things go and make peace) I said I would invite her for christmas day and did. She said yes and the plans were made. 

We were originally going to do Chinese for dinner on christmas day but changed it once my sister was coming over because my parents said they would treat but changed it to me going half. (not my sister) We ended up buying a bunch of food to cook instead since that would be nicer. Christmas eve went smooth and my parents stayed in a hotel because that is what they like to do. 

The following day is where the disaster began. My parents were suppose to come at 9 am as the kids (19f,11m,8f,7f,) were waiting for them to open their presents under the tree and my mom loves watching and being involved. At 10 am i called my mom and this is where it all really started I informed my mother that my sister would not be making it over because her partner was ill throwing up since 4 am. I thought it was best since she was also nauseous (though not throwing up) she stay home and we make plans for another day when they aren't feeling ill. Mind you at this point it's been an hour and my mom had not even reached out to me about being late or anything.  

My mother totally lost it and flipped out on me. She went off the handle screaming on the phone how she was just going to go home. I ended the call here. A few minutes later she kept repeatedly calling me, my husbasnd and daughter, we didn't answer because we were trying to enjoy christmas with the kids. Like 15 min later i called my father because I felt at this point she was out of line and I had every right to inform my sister it's best since their sick that they stay home.  I hear my mother immediately yelling again. 

My father tells me they have to come to my house because after driving around all morning no restaurants were open and my mom needed to eat. It's a routine for them they always get breakfast out before coming to our house when they stay a night. My mother just likes eating out and uses any reason to do so even though I'm perfectly capable and willing to make food. So I agree and let her come. Apparently they stopped at 7 11 to get eggs as if I didn't have any... I really don't know why she does these things it feels insulting. So they both eat and she was upset the kids already opened the gifts when she said she wasnt coming and was already over an hour past 9 am, and then rushes to leave so they can get home by 4 for my sister to instead come to their house. 

Basically just blowing me and my family off leaving us with no christmas plans. They left in such a rush my oldest didn't even get to give her her christmas gift.  My oldest whose 19 was upset my younger kids were upset too. I felt this was extremely disrespectful and rude. I feel like they just came to eat and take thier chicken back that was going to be cooked today and take left over ham for my sister. And all of this because I didn't want someone knowingly sick in my house. So instead of staying until 3 on christmas day and arriving at 9 am they rushed to leave and left by 11ish am and first arrived 10 30 ish. She also had already celebrated the holidays with my sister a few weeks proir leaving us with no plans. We could have had my fil over for christmas day but didn't because they were suppose to be here and my mother doesn't like him. 

2 hours after she leaves she messages me saying the hot chocolate and other coffees she brought to my home and had told my oldest daughter were for her, were for my sister. Aitah for feeling my mother was out of line and disrespectful?

So, if you‚Äôre hodling, sipping coffee, and manifesting gains, maybe ONDO might just be the bff your portfolio needs. But hey, don‚Äôt forget me when you're swimming in those $11 gains in 2030. $YOI‚Äôs coming soon too, and you know I'm all about that Solana-meets-AI vibe‚Äîstay tuned for token domination.

1hmaxjq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmaxjq,"Heard we're doing Christmas hauls! Dog got into the Wush Wush, but I saved most of it.","Dug into the Manhattan Wush Wush today. Figure I'd drink that first due to my dog getting into it. While opening gifts we noticed that a coffee bag shaped gift was mysteriously missing... couldn't possibly be the puppy eating, what looks like, coffee beans on his bed in the corner. Couldn't be!

He got about 8-10 beans. So today I may have learned that caffeine does very little on dogs. 

That Wush Wush though! A cup of raspberry and rose. Wasn't expecting to drink my top coffee of the year today. My God.

Happy holidays!",2,1735167013.0,pourover,1,0.75,False
