Gold just cleared **$4,100** as rate-cut odds climb, while the **Dow** notched a fresh record **48,254.82** — even as Big Tech cooled.

- **Gold** > $4,100; analysts float a path toward **$5,000 by Q4 2026**, with central banks still net buyers.
- **Dow** marks multiple record closes as a government shutdown resolution looks *imminent*; major US tech stocks underperform.
- **Manufacturing**: North American firms cut material orders in October, easing supply chain pressure but signaling a slowdown.
- **Trade**: Treasury Sec. Bessent says tariff cuts on coffee and fruits are coming; **Starbucks (SBUX) +1.5%**.
- **Jobs/Sentiment**: **55%** of US workers fear layoffs; job growth slowed to **27k/month** (May–Aug); consumer sentiment near record lows.

> CME Group (CME) FedWatch shows a **67%** probability of a December rate cut, reinforcing the bid under gold.

Why it matters: Rate-cut hopes are fueling a rotation—gold and defensives up, while growth/tech sees profit-taking. Tariff relief could brighten margins for consumer names like SBUX, but persistent layoff fears and soft hiring risk pressuring spending and Q4 guidance.

Background: The Dow’s rally has leaned on shutdown-resolution optimism, while gold’s run tracks falling real-yield expectations and ongoing central-bank demand. If labor anxiety intensifies, the equity breadth story could narrow further.

Stocks in focus:
- **SBUX**: +1.5% on coffee tariff cut talk.
- **DIS**: In focus ahead of earnings amid data-release noise from the shutdown.
- **CME**: FedWatch’s cut odds underpin bullion momentum.
- **AMZN**: Cited in broader US layoff concerns dragging sentiment.
- **UNH**: Benefits as a Dow component in the record-setting tape.

Are you rotating toward gold/defensives or buying the tech dip from here?

1ovtn52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ovtn52/got_ghosted_by_a_guy_i_was_seeing_for_a_week/,Got ghosted by a guy I was seeing for a week,"
I was on a six-week holiday in Canada and, on my last week, I finally decided to try dating on Bumble because, honestly, I hadn’t had sex in weeks. I matched with a few guys who wanted to meet later in the week, but that wouldn’t work for me. I needed it now and I was flying out soon, so there wouldn’t be enough time.

Then I matched with this one guy I’m pretty sure I even superliked because he was exactly my type. Tall as fuck. Great body. Loved pets. Same values. Wanted fun, intimacy, no commitment. Perfect. I told him, let’s meet tonight — and we did. We went to an arcade bar, had drinks, food, and played games. The conversation flowed easily, at least for me. After a short walk, we went to his car to “warm up”, and I knew what I was there for. We made out for a bit and I told him I wasn’t doing it in his car, we should go to his place instead. He said he lived an hour away and asked if that was okay. I said fuck yeah. So sleeping over was clearly on the table. I asked if he was fine with it, and he said yes.

We were playful the whole time. I even joked about him murdering me, but I had the advantage because no one knew who he was with. He told me to text my sister his address. He even showed me his driver’s licence before that, so I wasn’t worried.

We got to his place, he showed me around, and then we did the deed. It was insane — the best sex I’ve ever had. Everything just worked. He was big, strong, confident, all the spots were hit, the dirty talk was on point — everything.

The next morning, he made me breakfast. We cuddled, watched a film, napped, smoked, cuddled again. We were glued to each other. Skin always touching. Sniffing each other. Making out for long stretches even without having sex. Then sex again. And again. It felt like every 30 minutes.

He drove me home after, bought me Starbucks on the way, and we held hands the whole drive. I took over his phone’s Spotify and he didn’t mind at all.

He wanted to see me again that same night, so I Uber’d an hour to him. I brought him snacks from my culture we talked about, plus a spare hand cream since we’d joked about his dry hands. He seemed to like the gesture — he kept the hand cream in his car and I watched him use it constantly.

We watched Netflix, had more sex, and talked deeply about everything — family, grief, dogs, work, life. Then more sex. The next morning, I worked while he slept, then he woke up, made me coffee, and we went right back to cuddling and having sex again.

Three days before I had to leave, he said he wanted to take me out to dinner before I flew home. After work, he took me to a bar near my place. And this is where everything gets confusing.

He regularly talked about wanting to visit me in my home country. That night, he pinky-promised he’d visit in February. I didn’t care if this was just sex or him lovebombing — but I didn’t realise this was part of the game. He didn’t have to say any of that or make me hopeful. I knew we were both there for sex and intimacy for a short time. He could’ve just stopped.

But he kept going. He told me I was the girl of his dreams. That if it weren’t for the distance, he’d pursue me. That I was amazing. And sure, fine, but he didn’t need to pile it on. He even brought up FaceTiming after work once I got home so we could catch up. I DIDN’T ASK FOR THAT. None of it was me initiating — it was him saying all of it.

After dinner, we had a great night. We took pictures together — he suggested it and said he wanted “cute photos” from our last night. The next day, we were still talking. Even on the day I flew out, he was messaging me at the airport telling me to text him on my layover because he’d be awake. So I did, because I thought he meant it.

Since landing back home on Monday, it’s been radio silence. Nothing. He even posted on Instagram six hours ago but didn’t bother replying to me. This same guy who said “you have my word”, who said he’d book a one-way flight in November, who said he’d come see how long he could stay.

This is my first time being ghosted. I’ve hooked up before, but hookups never hurt because I knew my boundaries. I kept conversations shallow and didn’t let myself get comfortable. But this one made me let my guard down because I thought he was genuinely into me. Turns out, he was just better at the game. And I got played.

I’m so hurt. And as much as I want to double text and ask why, I know I shouldn’t.",1,1763014287.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1ovtn4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1ovtn4r/aita_for_selling_a_houseguests_things/,AITA - For Selling a Houseguests Things,"So I’ve been renting a 3bd townhome for years with a super chill landlord in a nice neighborhood for sometime. My longtime roommate broke her lease suddenly in March, leaving me scrambling to clean/furnish/remove left behind things from the entire house all while finding/vetting someone who wouldn’t spring this crap on me again.   Oh the irony.  In light of this news my sister referred me to this woman that has been staying with her — ‘Aimee’, who “just needed a place for a month.”  This news was almost perfect for me.  Renting the smaller, furnished room during this time would make me break even financially for the Month of March and cut my losses by half the following.  Sounded perfect—short stay, perfect timing, no stress.  Yeah… famous last words.

My first mistake was not requiring a deposit, I really didn’t think she could do damage in a month and if she did we would just deal with it as a case to case basis.  At the start things were good.  We seemed to get along and communicate well.  The repairs to the basement were going to take about 3 months which really slowed my plans of renting that room, but hey beats shelling out several thousand dollars or stuck with a crazy person in that time.  So when Aimee expressed interest in staying longer and I thought nothing of it, more luck my way.  The repairs in started to wrap in late May and I was starting to get antsy about finding a basement tenant but also had an extended trip planned in mid June so this time I asked if we could extend Aimee’s month to month to end after I got back on the condition that she would show the place while I was gone and dog sit while I was away.  I would be lying if I didn’t say this decision felt right at the time, it had been 3 months where I thought I knew this person.  

About halfway through this trip I received multiple messages from my neighbors about noise complains which gave me immediate pause because even though we shared a wall, I have never had that problem in my time there.  I relayed the info to Aimee and got some rather snarky replies “I turned it off 10 mins ago…” but also several hours late.  Also I didn’t receive any updates about my dog OR showings until I was about an hour from home.  Pieces of the puzzle felt missing.

Well upon arriving home some more things became clear: every window and door was wide open with Aimee’s music on each floor blasting next to it and I wasn’t sure which was escaping the house faster - the music or the forced air from the conditioner.  My plants looked like they were barely hanging on and my dog was hiding under a coffee table just to get out of the windows that faced SW.  She also had been very busy and made some “improvements” including rearranging the entire house (furniture/storage spaces) where I couldn’t find anything, ripped off the blinds on two windows, and relocated the curtains and rod assembly in her room.  Also the neighbors have stopped our morning chats at the mailbox and it’s pretty awkward.  I do not know how she managed to do all this in just two weeks.

* (Side bar: those curtains she relocated was some of the shoddiest work I have ever seen.  Of the three assemblies in the room and none of them were level nor did they line up with each other.  The space from the bottom of these floor length curtains ranged from 1 inch to 3 feet.  There were about 20 holes from presumably failed attempts as if she re-did her efforts no less than 4 times.  At this point I am convinced she is visually impaired and I am genuinely impressed she could operate a drill).

Having just come back from a vacation, I had decided I would let it go but told her this wasn’t a good fit and she needed to be out ASAP.  She paid me all that she had, $400 which got her mid July.  Days before the special event the excuses she couldn’t leave started to pile up.  Now the excuses in question deserve trigger warnings.  She was scared of her boyfriend back home and while I am entirely empathetic but this went on with a new story every day for 2 weeks past her sell by date — I was running a halfway house and didn’t even know it.  I finally saw an opening when one of her excuses became “not all my stuff can fit in my car” (*this will come up in a min….*).  Lightbulb.  Well she spent all summer saying how she wants to move to this area and get away from her toxic living situation... why take some of these things home just to bring it back anyway.  I offered to store it till October for free (at the time she was maintained she would be back here by then).  Desperation got the better of me but heck it worked and Aimee was out the next day and I could finally drop this drama that had absorbed my life and find a real human worth living with.

After undoing her “redecorating” it was pretty clear there were things that were taken without permission.  She had helped herself to everything in the closets, pantries, shed, and storage spaces: including extension chords, vitamins, several bottles of hydrogen peroxide, dog treats, dog food, various full bottles hygiene products, air fresheners, and the kicker……. a large bottle of my medication.  Like… ma’am, are you starting a black-market CVS?!  It’s not like they were those kinds of drugs…  No wonder her personal items had doubled in size of her SUV in just under 4 months.  Then I see the utility bill.  Her bad habit of keeping windows open during 100 degree days had made the utility bill $400 bucks more than previous years.  Clearly this was not a one off thing she did.  I sat down and came up with about $550 for back rent and half of the utilities, $200 worth of things missing, and about $300 in material costs for the repairs (if I got really creative).  And began to prepare my strategy for how to go about this.

October 1st hits and I haven’t heard from her at all since she left.  I test the waters with a text asking her if she has seen my bottle of my prescription meds and waited for her opportunity to maybe come clean, I really hoped she would.  I regret to say she did not seize this opportunity as she tried to claim that physically swallowing about 50 pills individually over several occasions was “unintentional.”  Now that is some poor word choice.  I followed up with a formal text saying she is not welcome back here and she has to get her stuff out of here by the end of November, 30 days after our original agreement as directed by my legal counsel (*ooo scary...*).  However if she returns the list of things that I found missing or the cost to replace it I would be willing to extend that date and continually work with her on a month by month basis to get her stuff back.  Now I won’t even tell you how little of her responses I read, so your guess is as good as mine how she took that.  I told her if she prefers she can pay me for the back rent, utilities, and storage fee but that would be about twice and much and sent her that invoice.  She eventually agreed to the first one.  I had been sending her biweekly reminders but wouldn’t ya know it, I don’t get anymore replies.

So internet….   What do you think, am I an asshole?  When she doesn’t get me my stuff back in time, should I sell it.  Some of it is pretty cool not gonna lie.  Any takers?  I always wanted to learn to play the base.

TLDR.

So I rent a cute townhome with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms great neighborhood, all that jazz.  All was well until my longterm roommate peaced out without notice with a mess behind didn’t leave me with a lot of options on a tight schedule.  Enter *Aimee* who was looking for a short term lease in my area and bought me time on repairs and saved me about 500 a month.  After she had been here for a bit I left on vacation to come home  traumatized dog, plants that were barely alive and pissed off neighbors that wont’t even look me in the eye now.  Took a breath called it even, told her to be out by mid July in two weeks.  Well that day arrives and y’ep you guessed it.  She refused to leave.  Each day with excuse—bad boyfriend, bad vibes, bad moon phase. I was basically running a halfway house and didn’t even know it.  As a misguided attempt to get her to leave I volunteered to hold her stuff until October for free.  Now that it’s past October still with her stuff and out about $1000 including *medications w*hen I just lost my coverage.  Joy\*.\*  I told her that she has to return these things or their value to replace them and I would not throw her stuff away at the end of November.",1,1763014286.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

He’s a doctor and he actually helped me get a job after graduation at the same hospital he works at, he runs a department and is a big and very respected doctor and he’s also a professor. 

He’d always come over and say hi to me and check up and stuff and sometimes he’d even spend a whole break with me and he’d always get me coffee and stuff, I thought he just saw me as a daughter because I was inseparable from his late daughter ever since we were toddlers and we had tens of sleepovers at each other’s homes. 

But about a month ago he asked me to lunch after work and he told me he’s actually fallen in love with me, he said he knows it’s weird but that he can’t hide it anymore, he said I reminded him of a better time and that he loves me, he said he’d love to marry me. 

Where we’re from age gap marriages aren’t really rare and looked down upon like it is in the us and my dad’s dead and mom doesn’t give a shit about me so my family wouldn’t really mind it, but idk, it seems really weird. I told him I needed to think about it first and he said of course. 

And honestly I’ve thought about it and I’d love too, he’s overall a good man and I never had the best luck with men, he has a great house and he’s honestly really cute and attractive with a funny and attractive personality, he’s also really confident which I like, and he’s rich and really nobody I think would have a problem with it.

Sanity check please 🙏🏻,"I need a reality check from people who actually understand what I’m experiencing, because I can’t tell if what’s happening is normal or if it’s as absurd as it feels . For context, I’m the Chief of Staff for our GTM team/CRO, I also support the CRO in an EA capacity, and I run our DC office. The office-management side used to be the easiest part of my role… That is until the CEO started traveling to DC bi-monthly w/ the expectation that as the office manager, I support him in-office while he’s there & even when his EA has traveled with him. None of this was ever mentioned in my four-round interview process, never appeared in my job description, and didn’t come up until months after I was hired. When this first started, I was reassured that it would be rare. His EA and Chief of Staff told me he’s barely ever in DC, maybe once every couple of months & that this “shouldn’t be an issue.” 

**Spoiler**: that promise aged like milk. Now, a year & a half in, the CEO is in DC every other week— twice a month for week-long stretches & every time, I’m pulled off my actual job to act as his makeshift admin. It’s completely changed the structure of my role, and it’s starting to drain me & feel unreasonable. My commute is 4 hours round-trip in rush hour, so the agreement when I accepted the job was that I’d only need to be in the office 1–2 days a week. That flexibility was a major factor in me taking the role.

Now on a regular basis, I’m expected to be in the office 4-5 days a wk handling everything his EA used to when she traveled with him to DC, e.g., ***printing documents, entering in his meeting IDs for him, ordering his coffee, greeting his guests***… He expects me to pause my work & take on mindless, *“just be available in case he needs something”* tasks. The visits are unpredictable, often with barely any warning, so I’ve had to regularly cancel important doctor appointments & even a medical procedure I had scheduled for months + had taken off for… just to hang around “in case” the CEO needs something. That’s another thing, **if I’ve taken off on one of the days that he plans a trip to DC, no matter how far in advance I took off, I’m expected to cancel my PTO.** This was NEVER disclosed or deliberate part of my role.

**In my experience, office managers aren’t expected to backfill for executive assistants. Is this as unusual as it feels, or am I missing something from office culture these days?** If you’re a office manager, or have worked closely with one, is this a normal expectation at your company, or does it sound as ridiculous and out-of-scope to you as it feels to me?

1ovtaq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/poemsbyreddit/comments/1ovtaq6/between_strangers_poem/,Between Strangers [POEM],"You shouldn’t mean anything to me—
and you don’t,
not in any way that lasts past morning.

Still, there was a gravity in you,
a quiet pull I recognized—
the kind of presence
that leaves a trace behind
long after the moment goes.

⸻

We laughed about nothing,
that easy, drifting nothing
that only exists between people
who owe each other nothing at all.

You offered the first small truths—
not heavy, but vulnerable—
the kind that open a door
without announcing an invitation.

So I let a few of mine slip out,
pieces I keep tucked
where few look.
I waited for the sting.
It never came.
It simply didn’t matter to you.

⸻

It wasn’t the night—
it was the looseness of it,
the slack in me
I hadn’t felt in years.

You weren’t gentle;
you were perceptive
in a way that felt almost sharp—
a gaze that cut clean lines
through whatever I pretended to be.

Not unkind—
just unnervingly accurate.

⸻

Maybe that’s why the next moment
slipped past my guard.

We were reading aloud,
words moving between us
light as breath,
when your hand found my leg—
steady, certain,
as if the gesture had been waiting
for its place in the evening.

And not until later
did your fingers reach my face,
brushing hair behind my ear,
touching me like someone
memorizing something
they knew wouldn’t last.

You noticed everything.
I noticed you noticing.

⸻

We made a choice
that left its weight on me,
and I’m still carrying it.

Later, alone,
I cried in a way that startled me—
not dramatic,
just a sudden shattering
of something I once thought solid.

⸻

Days passed.
I stepped into the cold
and let the air straighten my spine.

I ran and felt my voice return.
I danced down a sidewalk
with coffee warming my hands
like a promise I’d forgotten
I could give myself.

⸻

And in this unraveling—
this slow, honest peeling-back—
I’m meeting the part of myself
I tucked away for safekeeping.

The part that wants to feel fully,
to shape the ache into something,
to grow toward the person
I keep meaning to become.

It hurts—
but the hurt feels like direction.

⸻

Waking up is strange like that:
the clarity,
the tremor of what comes next,
uneasy about the work ahead,
yet grateful
for the chance
to rise into it.

I don’t know you,
not really.
But for a moment—
a brief crossing in borrowed time—
we met between strangers,
and something in me
moved that needed to.

I finally checked Cheapest bungee jumping in Rishikesh off my bucket list last month and wow, what a rush! It’s not just about the free fall; it’s about facing that tiny voice in your head that says **nope**.

If you’re planning your first jump (or just curious), here’s a quick guide and a few tips I wish someone had told me

1. Book through the official site

I booked through [rishikeshbungeejumping.com](https://rishikeshbungeejumping.com/)  they’re one of the most trusted operators with **international safety standards** and a super-experienced crew (some trained in New Zealand).  
Booking in advance online helps a lot, especially on weekends and holidays.

  
2. Choose the right time

Avoid May–June (too hot) and July–September (monsoon = cancellations).  
The sweet spot is **October to April**  clear skies, pleasant weather, and those gorgeous Himalayan views.  
They even have a full guide here → [Best Time for Bungee Jumping in Rishikesh](https://rishikeshbungeejumping.com/best-time/)

  
3. The jump is 90% mental

Standing on that ledge feels unreal  your body will hesitate even if your brain says “go.”  
Listen to the instructors, trust the gear, and *don’t look down too long*. The free fall is pure magic.

  
4. What to wear & carry

* Comfy clothes (no skirts or scarves)
* Sneakers > sandals
* Empty pockets! (lockers are available)
* Carry an ID for check-in

5. Getting there

It’s roughly 20–25 minutes from Rishikesh town center.  
If you’re planning the route or want to see nearby options, this page helps: [Bungee Jumping Near Me in Rishikesh](https://rishikeshbungeejumping.com/near-me/)

Bonus: Try the Flying Fox & Giant Swing too

If one adrenaline rush isn’t enough  the same site also offers:

* [Flying Fox in Rishikesh](https://rishikeshbungeejumping.com/flying-fox/)  glide horizontally at crazy speeds, solo or tandem.
* [Giant Swing in Rishikesh](https://rishikeshbungeejumping.com/giant-swing/)  kind of like bungee’s chill cousin, but still wild enough to make you scream.

They’re great add-ons if you want a full-day adventure instead of just one jump.

My personal tip

After the jump, take a short walk down to the river  the calm after that adrenaline hit is something else. And grab a coffee at *Little Buddha Café* back in town  the views are unreal.

Anyone else planning to try bungee or the swing soon?  
Happy to share my itinerary, what time slot I chose, and how to get the best video deal.  
Also open to hearing your experiences  especially if you’ve done all three!

1ovt66c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ovt66c/im_a_paranoid_schizophrenic_im_not_sure_if_my/,I'm a paranoid schizophrenic. I'm not sure if my house is haunted. (part 1),"When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, I was actually relieved. For months I had felt the closing maw of isolation. Fleeting feelings of fear and disgust had swirled through my head for at least a year, slowly shutting me off from the rest of the world. I felt like the world was watching me fall in on myself, and it looked on with indifference.

The day before the first doctor's appointment, my sister found me in my apartment barricaded in the bedroom. She had to get My apartment's groundskeeper to use bolt cutters on the door's chain lock just to get inside, and when she did finally get to the bedroom door I was less than cooperative. It took both her and the groundskeeper pushing against the door to move my bed out of the way, and from there it took another 20 minutes to talk me out of the room itself. When I emerged from the bedroom I was filthy; unwashed, hair matted, with a shaky grasp on what was happening at best. I can't remember most of what I saw and heard in the three days that I was locked in that apartment, and I think that's probably for the best.

My sister took me back to her house and let me shower and change there. Over the course of the day I came back to myself. Then over the course of the next 3 months my doctors ruled out a host of other possibilities before landing squarely on schizophrenia. It was surprisingly freeing to have an answer to the issues I had faced, to have a clear path forward and a new direction for my life. Everything was looking up.

I never went back to my apartment. I hired a moving company to take everything salvageable out and put it all into a storage locker, but I never went back inside. Even though I knew that the shadows in my peripheral vision and the eyes peeking through the blinds were all in my head, I couldn't shake the dark feeling I got from staying there. I stayed with my sister, much to the chagrin of her husband. Even though he was sympathetic, he didn't like the idea of a nutcase living with them. Especially not with a kid on the way. I can't say I blamed him.

That takes me to about 5 months ago. At the time, I was looking for a place to stay when I saw an ad in the newspaper for a house that recently went up for sale. The owner died in a nursing home, and the estate was set to sell the house off and divide the earnings between his children. The house itself wasn't anything impressive, just a one story house in the woods about 10 minutes outside of town. The place wasn't isolated by any means, having at least two houses within a quarter mile. But it was cheap after a few years of abandonment according to the real estate agent. I decided to ask for a showing and told my sister about it.

""Are you sure you're ready to live alone again? You're welcome to stay here, we could use an extra set of hands around the house anyways since I can't be on my feet for too long.""

""What, not ready to lose your personal chef just yet?""

She let out a little chuckle, but I could tell she was worried. I felt wholly indebted to her for putting up with me for so long. Moving out was the first step in my mind to repaying her.

""Look, I'll be fine. I've got a pretty good handle on things. Besides, I can tell I've overstayed my welcome.""

""Who told you that? Jeff?""

""Believe me, he didn't have to. Besides, I'm pretty sure this little guy doesn't want to have to share a room with his uncle.""

My sister looked down at her swollen belly. The due date was less than 2 months away and I could tell she was weighing the truth of my words against her perceived responsibility to me.

""Okay, but take lots of pictures for me.""

""Absolutely. I'll be back in a few hours.""

And with that, I was out the door and driving down the road. Anxiety coursed through my body, but I also felt incredibly optimistic. This felt like stepping into the light at the end of the tunnel. I finally felt a sense of normalcy after months of constant issues. I cannot begin to describe the amount of hope I felt in this moment.

The drive out of town took about 10 minutes, the drive to the house another 10. Driving 20 minutes either way for a Walmart run was going to take some getting used to, but if the price in the newspaper ad was accurate then the additional gas money and miles on my car would be well worth it. Before my breakdown I had never even hoped to afford a house on a book keeper's salary, but this was an opportunity for that dream to come true. Sure, the house probably needed some work, but I was eager to take on the challenge anyways. I quickly found out just how much of a challenge it would actually be.

When my phone told me to turn into the driveway, I had to stop in the middle of the road and look for it. There barely seemed to be any gaps in the trees, and the grass was almost as tall as the hood of my car. It took me a minute, but I finally saw the beginning of tire tracks leading into the grass and between two trees. I carefully maneuvered my car down an incredibly overgrown and bumpy driveway. As I cleared the initial line of trees, I could see a house rising above the tall grass about 100 yards from the road. It was bigger than I was expecting, with worn cedar siding that extended all the way to the ground, and a green steel roof. The windows were covered in dirt and cobwebs, preventing me from seeing anything inside while I sat in my car.

I called the realtor just to be sure I was at the right place, and she told me she was just up the road and would be pulling in behind me soon. I pulled up a picture of the ad from the newspaper and read it again. The ad described the house as a ""secluded estate"" with ""cottage vibes"". That description seemed like a bit of a stretch now. I was imagining something more... refined. This was less of a secluded cottage and more of an abandoned crack house. But I wasn't dissuaded at all.

The real estate agent pulled in behind me just a few minutes later. She stepped out of a rather beat up suburban and put her cigarette out in what she was trying to sell as my future yard. She then adjusted her long, curly bleach-blond hair (think ramen noodles) and walked over to shake my hand.

""Are you Brandon?""

""Yes ma'am.""

""Alright, glad to meet you! I'm Tara. Let's take a look, shall we?""

Tara's faux bubbly enthusiasm was betrayed by her smoker's rasp and tired eyes. Unexpectedly, she walked to the back of her SUV and opened it. I followed her, confused as to what she could possibly need from the trunk. She had to move over a pile of children's baseball bats and travel ball bags to get to the particular duffel bag she wanted. After digging inside for a moment, she pulled out a wad of blue nitrile gloves and some N95 masks. I was taken aback.

""I-Is it really that bad in there?""

""Oh, no no no. It's just dusty, plays hell with my allergies. The inspector cleared it of any mold or rodent problems. It's completely safe.""

I took the gloves hesitantly, less and less sure of my intentions to buy. She shut the gate on her vehicle to reveal 4 different travel ball jersey numbers. No wonder she looked so tired.

I followed her through the tall grass and up onto the porch. The steps and porch were both old and weather beaten, but seemed structurally fine. From the top of the stairs I could see the house better. It was at least 2 foot off the ground and resting on blocks, with vents cut into the cedar siding and covered by chicken wire. I'm assuming they were places to access the crawl space under the house. The windows were all old single pane affairs, but I didn't see any that were broken. Green shutters hung on both sides of each window, some hanging down from a broken hinge.

While I was checking out the house, Tara was struggling with the door. She had already gotten the key out of the lockbox, but even with the door unlocked it seemed to not want to budge. I only noticed when she took a step back and threw her whole shoulder into the door, causing it to open just a crack.

""Woah, are you okay? Do you need help?""

""Oh I'm fine sweetheart, this door just gets stuck when it's been dry for too long. The soil here dries and swells with the rain, and that will cause the house to shift a little. It's all in the inspector's report. It's nothing to worry about too much, once we get some rain it'll open a lot easier.""

She threw her hip into the door and it fully gave way into a decently spacious living room. She was right about the dust, it was quite bad. There were cobwebs hanging from ceiling fan and several sets of footprints leading all through the room towards various parts of the house. The house was fully furnished, but it was hard to tell what would be salvageable. Lack of power and humid Louisiana weather had ruined many of the wooden furnishings in the room. I was shocked that there was no mold, the conditions were ripe for it.

""Well, this is the living room."" Tara began, her voice muffled by the mask. ""You can see through those doors the dining room and kitchen, and to the left over here is one of the bathrooms and two of the bedrooms.""

I walked slowly towards the kitchen/dining room trying to soak in the feel of the house. The walls were old wood paneling and the floors were badly damaged linoleum. The whole place felt old, but in a nostalgic way rather than a bad one. I stepped through one of the two doors that lead to the dining room and kitchen and was immediately struck at the sight of the large bay window.

The window itself was in poor shape, sagging towards the back with dry rot through the base, but through it was an incredible view of the main attraction of the house. In the back yard past the covered porch and at the bottom of a shallow hill was a sizable oxbow lake. The water was placid, reflecting the pink hues of the afternoon sun in the most incredible way. I stood in front of it admiring the beauty for a moment.

https://preview.redd.it/utjlg8popy0g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27ed78ce7cf7b6e4d705f6e181d94bc8980976d3

""Like what you see?""

""The view is great."" I said, leaning gingerly against the rotting frame. ""Window leaves a bit to be desired though. How long has it been since anyone's been in here again?""

""Two years. The owner had a health event and ended up in hospice for most of that, but it's taken a few months for his estate to settle everything and get it on the market.""

""Why didn't the family take care of the place while he was in hospice?""

""I'm not supposed to say this but the owner was 96 and his youngest child was 72. Grandchildren and great grandchildren were all out of state and the one son who was in state just wasn't able to keep up with the place.""

""Okay, that makes sense. What's over here to the right?""

""That's the third bedroom and master bedroom, and over here on the left is a laundry room""

I walked through the bedrooms, bathrooms, checked out the back porch, you get the gist. The place was dirty, outdated, and in need of structural work, but even with all that on my mind I couldn't stop thinking about the view from the bay window. I could imagine myself sitting in front of that window in the morning with a cup of coffee. What a peaceful thought.

I left fully intending to place an offer, and two weeks later I was signing papers and picking up keys.

It took about a month of cleaning and a few big immediate fixes before I could finally move in, but I managed to get out of my sister's house just in time for Jeff to repaint the room powder blue and put all the baby furniture together. A week later and I was in the hospital with them for the delivery. Everything felt peaceful again. Everything felt right. But almost immediately after the baby was born things started to go south for me.

It started with auditory hallucinations. I would be in my new bedroom and hear whispers from the kitchen, but of course nobody was there. Then, things started to go missing or get moved around. I had trouble concentrating when I was home alone. I started to worry that the move was a bad idea, but I couldn't tell my sister that. So I kept my symptoms to myself, even as the nightmares began.

I remember the first one vividly, even now. I woke up in my bed and sat up, shivering. The air stung with a bitter and damp cold that chilled me right to the bone. I looked over to my right, and sitting in the doorway was a little girl. She had long, black hair that was dripping wet, and she wore a white night gown. She sat with her knees pressed against her chest facing away from me and towards the closed door. Her breaths came out in strained, wheezing gasps. For some reason I still can't explain, I was filled with an unnatural calm. I got out of bed still, shaking violently from the cold. I slowly walked towards her, and reached out my hand to grab her hair. Taking a big handful of hair, I realized I couldn't feel my hand getting wet.

""This... is a dream"" I whispered, struggling against every word.

And then I woke up, trembling as my heart beat against my ribcage. I don't know why I was so worked up, it wasn't a particularly scary dream. As I sat in my bed, I could still feel the icy chill against my skin. I stood up and went into the hallway to look at the thermostat. It read 48 degrees. The heat was on, but when I reached up to the vent I could feel the frigid air pouring out. *Perfect, more shit for me to fix.*

I turned the heat off, returned to my room, and threw on a pair of sweatpants and a thick jacket before taking my quilt off the bed and wrapping it around me. Slowly I moved to the kitchen. Pockets of cold air seeped up through the floor in places where the insulation under the house had fallen out, making the floor cold as ice against my feet. I threw open the door to the oven and set it to 400 degrees before popping down with my back against the corner cabinet and my feet tucked into the blanket. The house, as old as it was, had been ""updated"" to have no gas, so this was the best I could do to keep warm.

At some point I nodded off because I snapped awake to my alarm blaring from the bedroom. Falling asleep with the oven on was definitely not the proudest moment I've had, but the house was considerably warmer. I jumped up, turned the oven off, and hurriedly got ready for work. Just before I left the house, I stood in front of the large picture frame window I got to replace the collapsing bay window and admired the early morning sun as it was reflected off the lake.

As I looked more closely, absorbing every detail, I saw something strange in the water. It almost looked like a mop of long, black hair just poking out of the water. I could even just barely see the beginnings of a pale, sickly looking nose jutting out of it.

I dropped my coffee cup and ran over to the back door, but by the time I threw it open and jumped out onto the back porch the hair was gone. I scanned over the water, looking at every shadow and reflection, but there was nothing out there. The water was completely still as it had been on the day I first viewed the house.

I could feel the panic building in my chest. A deep, primordial part of me knew with absolute certainty that something was in that water, but I couldn't trust that. I knew I couldn't trust that. I took several deep breaths and grabbed onto one of the porch posts so that I could feel the wood grain against my palm. I focused on grounding myself, understanding what was real, and calming down. Panic wouldn't help me right now.

As I stood on the porch looking at the lake, everything looked so incredibly normal. The unease finally began to fade, and my heart returned to its normal pace. It wasn't real. I could let it go and move on. By the time I got to work, it seemed almost silly, seeing a girl from my dreams in the lake. But she wouldn't stay there.

I left work early to meet someone that could repair my broken heater. I had no intention of freezing my ass off for another night. While he worked on the unit, I ate a late lunch and then made a lap around the house looking at the siding. I had barely fixed the place up enough to make it livable, and the rest I needed to save up to work on. I was trying to decide whether the siding or windows would come next when I felt like something was watching from the woods behind me.

I froze, too terrified to move. The feeling came on so suddenly, and I could feel it with such certainty. As I stood there, absolutely still, I could feel the thing that was watching me get closer. Dry, new fallen leaves crunched in the pattern of footsteps, and I could feel its presence almost pressing against my back. From the corner of my vision I saw shadows closing in around my head, but before the shadows could leave my periphery and enter my vision, another shape came in quickly from the side.

""There you are sir.""

I jumped so hard I almost fell, letting out a terrified yelp. Immediately I whipped around to look behind me, my back pressed against the house. I scanned the trees for anything, but there was nothing there. No dark figures peeked out from behind the mass of trunks.

""Are you okay sir? I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you there. But to be fair, you scared me 'bout half to death yourself.""

I leaned forward, resting my hands against my knees and struggling against every breath. ""I'm fine, sorry. I just... wasn't expecting you.""

I let out a pitiful chuckle. This must look like such a ridiculous overreaction to him. I stood upright, taking my weight off the house, and faced him.

""Well, uh, I took a look at your unit. I couldn't see a thing wrong with it. You said it was blowing cold air last night?""

""Yeah, it was freezing.""

""Well, these old heat pump units will go into defrost mode and blow cold air for a few moments sometimes. That's usually only when it g-""

""No no, it wasn't blowing cold for a minute, it was blowing cold air for a while. When I got up the thermostat said 48 degrees.""

As I spoke, I could see his brow furrow in confusion.

""Well if it was blowing cold for a while then the reversing valve could have been stuck, but I already took a look at it and it can't be more than a few years old. And if it was the reversing valve getting stuck, I don't know how it would have gotten your place down to 48 when it was 65 last night. I'm gonna take a look at that thermostat, it sounds like it might have an issue too.""

""Okay, thank you"" I said, relieved that I wouldn't be replacing the whole unit. ""I'll be inside in a minute.""

He gave me a nod and turned to head back inside. I watched as he rounded the corner, then I turned my attention back to the woods. I leaned my back against the house again and scanned all the trees once more. Even though there was nothing there, I was still rattled by what had just happened. I'd never had a hallucination like that before, one that I could feel pressing into me. It was overwhelming.

The repair man didn't stay much longer. In the end he replaced the thermostat, but he couldn't find any issues with the heat pump itself. After he left I sat on the front porch for a while staring at the empty corn field across the highway. A cold breeze rattled the dead leaves that still clung to the trees. Usually I found this time of year so comfortable, but I couldn't make myself relax. I thought that once I got my medication and treatment plan everything could go back to normal, or at least near that. This was the point where I realized that wouldn't be the case.

That night I checked the heat to make sure it worked. The house had very little insulation and even when the nights weren't that cold it seemed like frigid drafts would creep in from every crack and seam. This time the warm air flowed without issue. By the time I crawled into bed the room was quite comfortable, and I quickly drifted into a dreamless sleep.

In the middle of the night, I found myself slowly waking up. I looked around the room, confused, but there was nothing there. I tried to sit up but found I couldn't move. Every muscle was too weak, too heavy. Then I felt it, pressing into my back. An imposing figure loomed everywhere behind me, just beyond my peripheral vision. I tried to free myself, but my body only got weaker and heavier. It felt like I was being pulled into the mattress. I wanted to cry out for help, but my jaw could barely move and my voice came out as a whisper.

Then, two long slender arms rose from out of the bed on either side of my head. They were cloaked in shadow, but I could barely see the pale, taught skin that covered them. The arms bent at knobby elbows, and hands came down to cover my eyes. At the same time it felt like a weight was pressing into my chest. I could barely breathe. I heard a voice from behind me:

*Count*

I lay completely still, trembling. Suddenly there was pressure on my neck as well, as if a belt had been wrapped around it.

*COUNT*

I took a shaky breath and then began to count.

""One... Two... Three...""

Each word came out as a strained whisper. With each number my body got heavier, breathing got harder, and the hands pulled back harder on my head.

""Four... Five... Six... Seven...""

My throat burned and my voice grew weaker. I could feel the palms pressing hard into my eyes, causing flashes of red and orange in my vision. I was gasping for breath between every word.

""Eight...""

I felt like I was drowning. Every fiber of my body was screaming in pain. I thought for the first time since the apartment that I might die.

""Nine...""

At this point I was holding on by a thread. Everything started to fade. My body felt like it was in freefall.

*Ten*

The last number I could only mouth. My vocal cords refused to move.

Suddenly I shot up in bed, gasping for breath. I shuffled backwards until my back was pressed against the wall and desperately searched the room for anything out of place. My heart felt like it was stuck in my throat, and sweat poured down my body.

I didn't go back to sleep that night. I sat in the bed shaking for hours, focusing on the texture of the wall against my back and the feel of the fabric on my legs. I saw shadows walking in my peripheral vision and heard voices whispering in adjacent rooms but I ignored them. They didn't feel real, not in the way that dream did. As I calmed down, the hallucinations stopped. I sat awake in bed until the sun finally came peeking through the windows.

I decided shortly after waking up that I would be calling in sick. I hated to do that to my boss, especially after he was so understanding during my mental crisis earlier in the year, but I needed to talk to someone about what was happening. I got dressed and texted my sister to let her know I would be coming over. I hated to lean on her again like this, especially so soon after the baby was born, but I was adrift in my own mind. I needed something, anything to grab onto.

\-

""Sleep paralysis? You've never had that before now, have you?""

""No, never. It was... awful. It didn't feel like a hallucination it felt visceral, like I was going to die.""

""Jesus, that sounds horrible. I'm so sorry Brandon.""

I could see the concern in her tired eyes. I could tell she had been getting even less sleep than me. I hated to dump this on her, but I really didn't have anywhere else to turn at this point.

""Have you talked to your therapist about this yet?""

""Uhh, no sis. It happened this morning. How would I have?""

""Ah, shit, right. Sorry.""

At this point I felt so incredibly stupid for even coming over here over what had been, ultimately, a bad dream. She was exhausted, barely coherent, and I decided to come bother her yet again.

""When are you going to tell him? When's your next appointment?""

""Tuesday.""

I lied. I felt bad for it, but I couldn't tell her that I hadn't seen my therapist for over a month. He didn't agree that I was ready to move out, but I couldn't stay here and continue to burden my sister. Even though I was worried he was right, he had to be wrong. I needed him to be wrong. But he wasn't.

I stayed and helped my sister around the house for a while. I cleaned, did the laundry, I even cooked for her. All to avoid going home. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something deeply wrong with that house. I did everything I could to delay it, but eventually I had to leave and I once again found myself making the long drive out to the secluded house I called home.

When I pulled into the driveway, I could feel my heart rate elevate. I spent 20 minutes in my car working up the courage to walk into my own house. When I finally did leave the car, I walked up the porch to the door, unlocked it, and immediately slammed into it. Shocked, I tested the deadbolt to find it was definitely unlocked. *Great*, I thought, *in the time I was gone somehow the ground dried enough to seal the door shut again.*

The door had been a little difficult to open this morning, but this seemed ridiculous. I turned the knob and threw my hip into the door, but it didn't budge even when I threw my full weight against it. After trying a few more times, I threw my hands up in frustration and started walking around to the back door. Thankfully that door was unaffected by the ground's swelling.

The moon shone bright overhead, illuminating the path around the side of the house. Shadows danced between the trees, but I tried to ignore that. I only thought about getting inside so I could make some apple cider and watch the trees waving in the lake's reflection. But when I turned the corner to the back of the house, I realized I could barely see the lake at all. A thick fog seemed to be rising from the water, one that was unaffected by the wind.

I slowed down and looked closer, a bit astonished. As I looked into the fog, I thought I could just make out something rising from the water of the lake. It looked like a dark mass of moss, until I saw the white night gown below it. My heart rate started to climb, but even still I walked over to the edge of the hill leading down to the lake. I knew the second that I saw her rising out of the lake that it was the same girl that I saw in my dream, and the same uncanny sense of calm washed over me.

I could feel her call drawing me towards the water, and every muscle in my body screamed out for me to follow her voice. Even with the biting cold of the wind burning against my cheeks, even when I reached the edge of the fog and felt it start to freeze against my skin, my body pulled me all the way to the edge of the lake. I stopped with the cold water just in front of my feet.

I felt like a prisoner in my own mind. Something deep inside me screamed out that I needed to stop, that I shouldn't go in the water, but her pull was stronger than reason. What finally snapped me out of it was feeling the cold water rush through my shoes. I fell backwards onto the shore and scrambled away from the water, shivering heavily in the cold.

I turned and ran up the hill, onto the porch, and pulled out my keys. Just before unlocking the door, I looked back and saw the girl from the lake standing at the top of the hill next to a tree. Panicking, I unlocked the door and threw it open, slamming it behind me and locking it shut. I even left the keys in the lock, something I would regret later on.

Inside, the house was almost colder than outside. My breath hung thick in the air, almost like smoke. Through the large picture frame window I saw the girl still standing by the tree. A thick fog rolled in from behind her, limiting visibility until nothing could be seen outside the house at all except an eerie gray screen. The house was still, dark, and quiet. The only sound I could hear was my own teeth chattering.

I took off my wet shoes and socks only to find the floor cold as ice. In the hallway outside my bedroom I checked the thermostat to see that it read 24 degrees. The heat was set to on, but nothing was running. Flipping the light switch in the hallway didn't turn on the light, and looking over in the kitchen I could see the clock wasn't illuminated on the stove. I had no power.

I went into my bedroom and put on whatever warm clothing I could find. A sweater, a coat, wool socks, slippers, etc. Pacing the room, I tried to wrap my head around what was happening. Something was deeply wrong with me, I shouldn't be hallucinating so vividly. *Had my medication stopped working?* I don't know why that would happen so suddenly when I had no problems with it before. *Maybe I missed a dose?*

I looked towards the bathroom and noticed something square sticking out past the door frame. I grabbed a flashlight and shined it into the bathroom just to get part of it to be shown back at me. The square sticking out was a mirror, specifically the mirror for my medicine cabinet. *My medicine cabinet was open.*

I slowly walked into the bathroom. In the sink, below the medicine cabinet, my pill bottle sat empty with the mouth facing the drain. I was completely out of Risperdal. It was Friday night long after my doctor had gone home and the pharmacy had closed and I was out of my antipsychotic.

I picked the pill bottle up and dropped to my knees, completely numb. *How? How had this happened?* Did I not put the cap on fully? Did I place the bottle on the edge of the shelf and it fell? Did I not close the medicine cabinet all the way?

Deep down I knew there was no way that all of that could have happened. No, these pills were dumped down the drain on purpose. There was something in this house with me, I wasn't delusional. I had to get out.

I stood up and walked towards the back door. As I passed through the kitchen and dining room, I could see the fog hadn't lifted. I knew that somewhere out there in the fog the girl from the lake was waiting for me, but I didn't care. I needed to get somewhere safe, somewhere far away from this house. Maybe a hotel or a hospital.

I got to the back door and reached for the deadbolt, but it wasn't there. In it's place was a keyhole, as if the lock had been flipped. A sick practical joke, and one I didn't find funny.

I reached for my phone but found my pocket empty. I went looking in the bedroom, the bathroom, all over, but then I remembered that I left it in my car where I had been listening to a podcast. The front door was stuck, the back door was locked, and I didn't have a way to call anyone for help. I was trapped inside.",1,1763012684.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

and you don’t,
not in any way that lasts past morning.

Still, there was a gravity in you,
a quiet pull I recognized—
the kind of presence
that leaves a trace behind
long after the moment goes.

⸻

We laughed about nothing,
that easy, drifting nothing
that only exists between people
who owe each other nothing at all.

You offered the first small truths—
not heavy, but vulnerable—
the kind that open a door
without announcing an invitation.

So I let a few of mine slip out,
pieces I keep tucked
where few look.
I waited for the sting.
It never came.
It simply didn’t matter to you.

⸻

It wasn’t the night—
it was the looseness of it,
the slack in me
I hadn’t felt in years.

You weren’t gentle;
you were perceptive
in a way that felt almost sharp—
a gaze that cut clean lines
through whatever I pretended to be.

Not unkind—
just unnervingly accurate.

⸻

Maybe that’s why the next moment
slipped past my guard.

We were reading aloud,
words moving between us
light as breath,
when your hand found my leg—
steady, certain,
as if the gesture had been waiting
for its place in the evening.

And not until later
did your fingers reach my face,
brushing hair behind my ear,
touching me like someone
memorizing something
they knew wouldn’t last.

You noticed everything.
I noticed you noticing.

⸻

We made a choice
that left its weight on me,
and I’m still carrying it.

Later, alone,
I cried in a way that startled me—
not dramatic,
just a sudden shattering
of something I once thought solid.

⸻

Days passed.
I stepped into the cold
and let the air straighten my spine.

I ran and felt my voice return.
I danced down a sidewalk
with coffee warming my hands
like a promise I’d forgotten
I could give myself.

⸻

And in this unraveling—
this slow, honest peeling-back—
I’m meeting the part of myself
I tucked away for safekeeping.

The part that wants to feel fully,
to shape the ache into something,
to grow toward the person
I keep meaning to become.

It hurts—
but the hurt feels like direction.

⸻

Waking up is strange like that:
the clarity,
the tremor of what comes next,
uneasy about the work ahead,
yet grateful
for the chance
to rise into it.

I don’t know you,
not really.
But for a moment—
a brief crossing in borrowed time—
we met between strangers,
and something in me
moved that needed to.

KOTA LIFE:

So it started in Kota and we met through our mutual friend (let say Khushi) . One day I have to return test papers to my friend Khushi, so when I had gone to return papers, I was standing and waiting for her on the side of a road, and suddenly she came with her friend (my ex), and we greeted each other with a simple ""Hii,” and then I had returned her paper, and then I came back to my PG. It was the first time she saw me (my ex), and she developed a crush on me. Now after that, we met at the Diwali holiday.

It was a Diwali holiday, and the whole Kota class went to their home except those whose parents didn't call them (including me). Me, Khushi, and my ex (let her call Shreya) went out for coffee, and we sat at the restaurant and ordered three cold coffees. My ex has her big sister and she told her that she was going out with her friend. But as her sister also lived in Kota, she had a doubt, and she called her frequently to come back to the hostel; that’s why our outing didn't last for more than 30 minutes. After that, I went to a shop to take a chicken role because as all the markets are closed due to Diwali so I have to eat outside. When I was standing and waiting for my chicken role to get ready, I received a WhatsApp text from an unknown number saying,

She: “Hi, Shreya, this side!”

“Sorry vo meri didi thoda chinta kr rhi thi mera vo bhi kota rhh chuki hain to unko sb pta hain yha ka mauhal iss liye mujhe aane ko bol rhi thi.”

(Sorry, my sister was calling me frequently because she knows Kota and she was worried about me.)“

Me: I replied, “Arre koi na! Main samajh skta hu.

(Don't worry, I can understand). From there, the story starts of my relationship.

So from that day on, we started talking to each other over the phone and chat, and since we were in the same batch (by coincidence), we also asked questions of each other and helped each other in studying. One fine day in morning I was sleeping and she texted me,

She: “Mujhe tumhe kuch batana hain. Main ab aur nhi rhh skti meri padhayi barbaad ho shi ye sb soch soch ke.”

I want to tell you something. I don’t want to hide it more because it effects my study.)

Me: “Haan bolo kya bolna hain.”.

Yes tell me what you want to say.

She: “I like you.”

Me: “What??”

She: “Haan main tumhe ye bahut dino se batana chah rhi thi lrkin bta nhi pa rhi thi.”

(Yes, I have been wanting to tell you this for a long time but was not able to tell you.)

Me: “okay!!”

She: “Okay, kya tum nhi bologe kuch.”

(Why won't you say something?)

Me: ”I need some time to answer.”

Another day I agreed to this relationship after that when we were in Kota (we were preparing for JEE) and we were all droppers, so this all happens under 1 month after we met (we met in November or in October during Diwali 2022 and we came into relationship on 5th December) and after one month we have our first paper of JEE MAINS and we have prepared well for that so we went for exam; she has her exam one day before me, and our exams went well as per our imagination. We have planned to go for a bike trip to “GARADIA MAHADEV.” Those who lived in Kota know this place very well. It is famous for it’s perfect view. So we went to a trip after the exams. After the exams, when results came out, I got a higher percentile then her. She was very upset because one of her teachers told her that in drop year you won’t be getting good marks, and she can see it. I motivated her, helped her in every aspect, and prioritised her studies more than mine. We were in video calls for a full day studying with full focus and clearing each other's doubts. Now the dates of the second paper of JEE MAINS came out, and we started studying very hard day by day. We gave our exams, and results came out, and this she got a higher percentile, and me and I really got a very lower percentile because I prioritised her studies more than me. After the results, I cried a lot because of my mistake. She motivated me and after that, we started preparing for JEE ADVANCED. We have around 1.5 month for Advance exam and the time flies and the day came of the exam My centre went to Jaipur, and her was in Kota, so we were not there for each other on the day of the exam. We both talked on the phone before going to the centre. Our exams went well after the exam; our Kota life came to an end as we were not taking more drop If we failed. We have 3 days before going to home and we had a lot of fun during these days and we went to our home with the same train; she live in Patna and I live in Lucknow. We thought that this was the last time we were seeing each other face-to-face.

HOME :

We reached home, and after a few days, results are out of JEE Advanced, and she got selected and got an 11K rank in the Advanced exam, and I went into a trauma because I can see my failure (I can’t even qualify for Advanced). She texted me after the results; she was happy, but after knowing my result, she also went to trauma. We were broke. I got hate from everyone; everyone doubted my skills as I got much better marks in my 12th Advanced exams. I was in trauma for around 2 months and she helped me lot to get me out of trauma. I cried every night for around 2 months, and she was with me every night on a phone call, helping me to get out of this trauma. Parallel to this, our JOSSAA counselling has started. We started filling our choices of college and branch and after the end of counselling, she got IIT BOMBAY and I got NIT ROURKELA Now we are at a distance of 1500 Km.

College (the end of relation part: 1):

We started our college life, and during 1 month of the first semester it went very well, and after mid-semester exams there was a holiday of Dusherra of around 10 days in my college, and I went to Bombay to meet her (yes, we met again). I spent 3 nights and 4 days in Bombay; these were the moments I never wanted to let go of. The day I was going back to Rourkela, she told me to meet her friends, and I agreed. I met them; they were boys and a girl. But one other boy named, let him call “X”, I met and i said to her, stay away from him ( I don’t know but I felt insecure from his behaviour towards her). Now, the story begins I came to Rourkela and our end-sem were near so we started preparing for it and we gave our exams and our results came out at that time Also, I got more CG then her. Now she started blaming me, ” It was because of you We were talking the whole day How can I study then? I wait for your message whole day When you message me, I can talk to you. My whole day went out thinking about you. When will we meet again? She started crying and as always, I helped her in every manner I woke her up for studying I scolded her for studying because she told me I wouldn't study unless you scolded me. “ After that, she fights with me regularly, and I always try to keep her calm. I do everything for her that makes her feel calm, but all in vain. Now she makes excuses that she can't understand math, and there was a boy who knew math very well. I will study with him and will do well in the exam, I agreed (if she can earn a great CGP, I will always be happy). Now she studies with him. Nights when I call her, she doesn't pick up my calls and texts me, “I am studying. I will call you later.”. Now I can understand very well that she was losing interest in me because she was surrounded by the most talented brains of India. Time overflows with this and here came her birthday and I made plan to make her happy. I had written a beautiful shayari for her to feel special. I have also called her 30 minutes ago before 12 AM but all in vain because her friends take her to celebrate her birthday at 11:55 pm and I can’t even wish her happy birthday at 12 AM . After that, I called her 10 times but she didn’t pick my call She called me back at 2 PM because I have to wake up early in the morning so I have slept and can’t pick her call Now here comes the birthday gift. She was thinking that I would order a dress for her that she could wear to celebrate her birthday, but my plan was different. I have ordered a beautiful pendant for her and due to bad delivery service, the pendant came after a day of her birthday. She even did not open the box, and she returned it without even seeing it. Now this time I was so sad and so mad at her because it's not my fault I only tried to make her happy.

SUMMER BREAKS( final chapter) :

Now in summer breaks, one day I saw her story She posted a story on Instagram of his birthday (a guy named X). She was sitting on his laps on a chair, and the hands of the boy were on her chest area but a little above (I don't want to disrespect her), and the story speaks Happy birthday, X. I texted her with a screenshot.

Me : What is this?

She: What?

Me: Where are you sitting, and where were his hands?

She: I was sitting on a chair.

Me : Are you mad or what? You can’t see what you are doing.

She: Yes, it’s normal here; it is Bombay.

Me : Wow ! Now it is normal for that girl who doesn't even know what a relationship is and how boys react to girls. (Plot twist: She knows nothing about relationships about boys feeling about anything when she meets me.). She only knows about the relationship that “Both live together and help each other.” I explained everything to her and taught him how to deal with everything and how to understand anything. She was so immature. I like her immaturity, but I also helped her in every single situation and made her mature enough that when I am not around her, she can tackle every situation. But I didn’t know that, whom I made that mature and told everything about this cruel world, she would cheat me and go away. From that day, separation between us started and one day she told everything to her sister and she came like an enemy in our relationship She told her to leave me and date X and she agreed and left me behind like a fallen leaf.

Now she blocked me from every source through which I could contact her.

Around 3 weeks ago, I saw a reel of salsa night in IIT Bombay. I had seen her in the reel; she was dancing with that X.

Our relationship lasted for 1.7 years.

I didn’t expect much, but it turned out really good. The mix of caffeine with vitamins B6 and B12 gives a quick lift in energy and focus without the sugar crash that comes with most energy drinks. It’s also keto friendly, has zero net carbs, and is safe for people watching their blood sugar.

What I like most is how clean it feels. No jitters, no heavy crash, and no weird aftertaste. The Allulose gives it a light sweetness instead of that artificial syrup flavor.

I’ve been using it before workouts and sometimes in the afternoon when I’m low on energy. If you want a cleaner option than coffee or sugary energy drinks, a [B12 energy shot with caffeine](https://jacasugar.com/products/jaca-jolt) is definitely worth a try.

1ovt2nl,https://i.redd.it/agqn64ovoy0g1.jpeg,I never understood the expensive coffee buying habit.,"So my colleague buys a cup of branded coffee everyday. Sometimes starbucks, costa, third wave coffee. We had a work meeting today and he said let's have the meeting at coffee shop as he didn't have time to buy when coming in.
We went there and he casually ordered a coffee for Rs280. I could guess it's his regular order.

By the time he paid, my habit of mental math took over. Even if he drinks this only 5 days a week, it's Rs5k+ just for one time coffee. For a fraction of the cost,I could buy the most premium coffee or even better, save for 3-4 months and buy a basic barista machine at home.
My turn was next, I simply didn't order because my brain could not reason at the moment.

I love good coffee and once in a while barista made coffee is a treat but this attrocious cost for a single cup boggles me as a regular expense.

Ps. I make my own filter coffee at home every morning.",69,1763012352.0,Frugal_Ind,33,0.95,False

I’ve been writing a short story series called *My Sundown Semester*. It’s kind of half *slice-of-life college drama*, half *“what if something weird really did happen during junior year?”* Think late nights, burnout, awkward crushes, and maybe a few powers nobody signed up for.

This first chapter introduces Ronnie, who’s just trying to make it through her first semester of junior year without completely falling apart… or accidentally showing that she might not be entirely normal.

I’d love any feedback, especially on tone and pacing—thanks for giving it a read!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone on the team says that baseball is ninety percent mental and ten percent physical. But for me, it’s more of a fifty-fifty split — keeping my swing consistent, and not dashing *too* fast around the bases.



Oh! Sorry for just jumping right in, I’m Veronica Day. All my friends just call me Ronnie.



“Veronica” sounds like someone who has her life together, and I definitely don’t.



I’m twenty-one, and a college junior at Lakeshore University in Chicago, Illinois, who lives in an off-campus apartment with a roommate who keeps trying to get me to “embrace the morning”. I’ve lost count of how many times she’s tried to drag me out of the house on 7 am jogs, but I do my best to pretend I’m a morning person for her.



It’s not going great. But hey, I’ve stopped hissing at the sunrise. Progress!



Today, I was just getting ready for class in my room when suddenly my roommate, Annie, barged in and brandished her phone at me. “What’s this about, Day?” She asked with a mischievous smile.



“What am I looking at, Annie?” I replied as I pulled up the hood on my hoodie.

It was a Chicago Tribune headline that read “Day Family Donates Fortune To Children’s Hospital”. There was a picture below the headline of my mom, Vivienne Day, signing one of those giant checks you see on daytime game shows.



“Oh, yeah, that,” I replied, looking down at my sneakers.



Annie’s mood suddenly seemed to shift. She got down on my level and turned her smile from mischievous to warm. “Hey, I’m not trying to be catty or anything. I wish my family did cool stuff like that; you should be proud.”



“Yeah, I don’t know. Being in the news has kind of always been our thing. It gets old faster than you’d think.” I replied.



That sentence seemed to hang in the air between us for a second, but then suddenly Annie perked up again.



“Oh! Here, I know what would make you feel better! Can I make you a smoothie? Blueberry and banana, it’s super yummy!”



I craned my neck past her, standing in front of me, to see her mini blender on the counter of our shoebox of a kitchen. Yup, there was a tall glass filled with blueish-purple liquid.



“Oh, thanks!” I replied with a well-disguised smile, “I’ll stick with one of my black-cherry protein shakes.”



“Oh, okay, that’s cool.” Annie started to leave my room, “You should get going, though. Didn’t you say your Advanced Communication Studies professor is a real hardass about being late? Which one was he?”



“Professor Nagle. Yeah, he’s tough, but I’m on his good side!” I stood up and followed her out to the kitchen, “Let’s try and keep it that way!” We both laughed, and I carefully reached into the fridge to get one of my protein shakes. One of my protein shakes that I *never* take out of the black plastic bottle that I put it in originally -- when Annie was asleep, of course. 



We walked and talked together on our way to the train. This time of year is my favorite; the autumnal chill in the air reminds me so much of being little and playing around my family’s estate. The dark, leaf-bare trees always seemed to tower above as I’d play hide and seek with my dad. I’ve always been really short, so I had no shortage of places I could hide in that big yard. Sometimes I’d even just bury myself in a big pile of leaves and let out quick little giggles as my dad would walk right by me, saying in an exaggerated tone, “Hmmmm… I wonder where Ronnie could have gone to hide!” Then I’d jump out and yell, “Here I am!” Those days seem like only yesterday, but also a lifetime ago.



Suddenly, my little nostalgia trip is interrupted by the train’s intercom. 



*“Diversey. Diversey is next.”*



I guess that means we’d better get ready to step off. Our stop is next. It always strikes me that I chose this life of my own accord. My family’s estate is right over in Lincoln Park, and they practically own half the neighborhood that Annie and I live in. Yet here I am -- a college student actually making my own way in the world, not just signing giant checks or sitting through another one of those lavish, secret dinners, where the Day legacy keeps being bolstered by both ethical and not-so-ethical means alike. 



Right now, though, as we get off the train, Annie is talking to me about having our third good friend, Marisol, over for pizza tonight. 



“Yeah! She’s really excited about that new play she’s in,” Annie says in an excited voice.



“Good for her,” I reply, “Mari always just owns the stage when she steps out under all that light. She’s been that way ever since I first met her in the cafeteria during the first week of sophomore year.”



“If I recall correctly,” Annie began, trying to contain her laughter.



And oh boy, she’s not wrong.



“She was with her theater buddies singing the words to a cabaret-style cover of ‘All Star’ by Smash Mouth and spilled the chocolate milk you were drinking when she tried dancing next to your table.” 



She’s not lying, that’s exactly how Mari and I first met, and even if I was really pissed in the moment, it’s crazy how fast we became friends soon after. She immediately apologized and brought me a bunch of napkins from a nearby dispenser; That being the napkin dispenser right at my two-person table. She then told her theater buddies that she’d catch up with them later, and started chatting me up about the homework I was reading up on for my History of Broadcast Media class: “From Monty Python to Carol Burnett -- The Way Satire Revolutionizes Generations”. 



Her face lit up when she started telling me about all her favorite skits from Monty Python, and how much she loved absurd, over-the-top comedy. She then asked me what the funniest thing I’d seen that day was. When I told her I didn’t know, and that my days were usually pretty quiet, she started telling me all the corniest jokes she could think of until I was almost head-down on the table with laughter. Not really because her jokes were funny, but more because I was touched that she really, genuinely wanted to make my day brighter.



We arrive at the “Letters and Sciences Building”, and Annie turns right to go to her Seminar on Desert Ecology, as I turn left to go to Advanced Communication Studies. I get in my seat right on time, but today it’s Professor Nagle who’s late! Finally, after around five minutes, he comes into the room fumbling through his notes for the day. About thirty-five pairs of eyes follow him as he goes over to the desk at the front of the room. 



“I know, I know,” he began exasperatedly, “it’s usually me who’s chastising all of you who are late. I’m human too, though.”



When that little appeal seems to fall on deaf ears, it’s time to break out the heavy artillery.



“Okay, well, we have a lot to get to today. So much, in fact, that we don’t even have time for the pop quiz I was going to give all of you!” 

A guy behind me let out a half-hearted “Yay…” which moved us along to getting into class and got a few laughs. Professor Nagle isn’t a bad professor; he’s just really quiet and doesn’t exactly know how to handle awkward situations. He also tends to ramble and meander through the actual lecture material, from growing up in Bridgeport and how much he knows Chicago, to the 2006 Chicago White Sox, to the perfect soda bread recipe. But I guess we always end up where we’re supposed to by the end of class. 



After class, I have half an hour for a cup of coffee and a sandwich before I go to my second class of the day: Digital Video Editing. I’m not really the best with technology and computers, but I still love this class. Most of what we do is edit footage together to make commercials and short broadcast segments. I really don’t like being in front of a camera for various reasons, but I like being able to just sink back in a chair and be productive for a while without having to talk to many other people. The class is really small, too. Much smaller than Advanced Communication Studies, it’s only around ten people. 



When that class is done, I put in my earbuds and sit on a bench outside for a few minutes to enjoy the day before I head back to the apartment. Annie’s going to be going to her part-time job at the campus bookstore, so I’ll have the place to myself for a little while. 



I honestly wonder how long I’ll be able to stay here without being pulled back into the never-ending soap opera that is the Day family. I don’t mean stay here, like at Lakeshore, but more so stay in this kind of life. Despite my health conditions and family shadow that follows me wherever I go, I love this current life and where it’s leading me! Annie, Mari, and I are all great friends. I’m really getting more and more interested in video editing. So much so, in fact, that I think I’d like a job in it one day. *Ronnie Day: Independent Video Consultant*. I like it.



After a few minutes, the sun gets to be too much for me, so I get back on the train and go back to the apartment. As I get off the train, I see a really adorable labradoodle walking with his owner towards me, but when I smile and reach out a hand for a pet, he freezes up and darts to the other side of his owner, a little old grandma.



“Oh, that’s strange. He’s usually really friendly with strangers. I wonder what’s gotten into him?” said the old lady, as the dog began to growl.



It’s at moments like these that I feel a sudden falling in my chest. That I’m not like the other people around me. Even though I have dreams about leading a life away from aristocracy, I feel like one day fate will just rip the mask off of the secret I’ve been trying so hard to distance myself from. If even the freakin’ dog on the street can figure it out, one day everyone else will, too.



In all of my brooding, I found that I’d walked myself home and was now on my bed in the dark, feeling a tear form in the corner of my eye. I pull the throw on my bed up over me, almost as if to just get away from everything in the world.



Suddenly, I heard the front door creak open, and Annie’s voice made its way into my room.



“Ronnie? I’m home!” 



Immediately, I wiped my eyes, threw off the blanket, and planted a random book on my bed to make it look like I wasn’t just crying. 



*The instruction manual from my laptop. Because nothing screams ‘emotional stability’ like a little light reading on system settings.*



One look in the mirror to make sure my eyes didn’t look too weird, and I walked out to meet her.



“Wow, you’re home awfully late,” I said jokingly.



“Am I?” Annie replied with a smirk, “I was just out buying some smokes. God, Woman, why you gotta be all up in my grill?”



“You don’t even smoke, and we don’t have a grill,” I replied with a laugh.



Annie just smiled and rolled her eyes. 



“Now, come on!” she said, gesturing down our short hallway to the living room. “Don’t you remember what we’re doing tonight?” 



*Oh crap! That’s right! Pizza with Mari!*



“Yeah, pizza!” I replied, trying to mask the fact that I completely forgot all about Mari. “What time is she getting here?” 



“Oh, yeah. I think she said --” and at that moment, we both heard a sudden voice yelling out from the courtyard below: “Hello?! Hello up there?! Please let me in! I’m but a starving, sweet little girl…”



“She’s here,” we both say in unison, trying to contain our laughter.



Annie goes down the stairs to let her up, and I turn on the oven to heat up the pizza she has for us to share. 

When Mari walks in the door, my mood immediately lights up. She got us pizza from Dante’s just up the street, my favorite! They’re always so cool about skipping the garlic butter on their crust. And if I know our little friend group, we ordered our ‘za with a third-pepperoni for me, a third pepperoni and pineapple for Annie (she will *never* convert me), and a third with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes for Mari. The cooks at that place must either love us or hate us. 



“Mari! You brought Dante’s!” I cried.



“Ronnie! I brought Dante’s!” She responded with a nod and a smile.



I walked up to Mari to take the pizza to the kitchen, but just when I reached up my arms to take the box, she set it down on the coffee table and pulled me into a big hug.



After two seconds, I can’t breathe and start trying to wriggle free. After another eight seconds of trying to break free of Annie joining in for a giant group hug, I finally manage to push them both off of me.



Soon enough, we all have a glass of iced tea and are sitting around our coffee table eating deliciously hot pizza. Mari has an episode of Mr. Bean playing on our TV for background noise as we chat about our days.



“And then I came here, and got my hug rejected by bite-sized Ronnie,” Mari laughed.



“Mari, you’re a great friend,” I began with a smirk, “but when you and all your tallness bears down on my little five-foot-four self, it’s a lot to take in.”



“She’s only six inches taller,” remarked Annie, “how *a lot* can it possibly be?” 



Mari stood up from her spot on the couch and dramatically sang “I’m just full of so much love for my friends!”



You know what, maybe this is kind of the answer to what I had thought about earlier today. There might be a lot of things on my mind, and a lot of things that I’m hiding from the world, but I have the two best friends a woman could ever ask for sitting on either side of me on this couch. Do they break out into song *way* too much, ambush me with sudden hugs and pineapple up my poor, defenseless pizza? Yes. 



But they also always know how to make me feel better, make sure I’m always included and at home in everything we do, and are here for me when I need them. Even if I’m not totally “right” with the world, I know I’ll always be right in the eyes of my best friends.

it published it and it had a lot of traffic, but as the traffic increased, i needed to pay more so that i could have better speeds. no problem! i upgraded from the free tier to the 7$ a month tier on render. but then it still wasn't enough, and i don't want to rely on my parents for money. so at that time i shut the project down.

today i revamped the website, made it look cleaner, simple, and minimalistic. but i have begun working on the new features i plan to implement and the user auth. but as i am rebuilding this project, i want to get feedback on the current website and see where improvement calls.

at the moment i do know that it's slow but it still works, i am trying to get enough donations ot that i can upgrade to the next tier which is 25$ a month. hopefully adding the ""buy me a coffee"" link will engage the users.

please give me feedback on how i can improve the page and make it more enticing.

I am an OG watcher and basically have GG on in my house constantly. But I was just watching Season 6, Ep. 11: The Perfect Dress, which is the tail end of the Rory/Logan separation. 

In the episode Rory finally is moving back to Yale. On her very first day, the same day she moves in to Paris’s apartment, presumably before classes have started, Logan is shown waiting at the coffee cart for Rory and says “I knew you’d have to hit the coffee cart eventually,” at which point Rory says nothing and turns and walks away. 

But how did Logan know she had re-enrolled in Yale and that she would be there on campus that day? Furthermore, he later shows up outside Paris’s/Rory’s apartment and tells her he loves her. How did he know Rory had moved in with Paris (I assume by making an easy assumption) and how did he know where Paris lived? Who was giving Logan all this intel?

If we follow the theoretical timeline of their break-up and the events that unfolded with how they broke up, they haven’t spoken since like late October….was it Colin and Finn who helped Rory move out of her grandparents house? Did she tell them, “Hey, I’m going back to Yale.” Even though at that point she hadn’t made the arrangements and hadn’t yet decided to move back in with Paris and so had no clue where or when she’d actually be at Yale. 

This is absolutely not that serious but as I said I have watched this show infinite number of times and this just now occurs to me so I must know your theories. Thank you! 🙏🏻 ",4,1763012075.0,GilmoreGirls,3,1.0,False

I am also getting her a digital camera because she asked to go to Disneyland for this Christmas, and a few weeks ago she said she wishes she had a digital camera to take pictures there, so I'm getting her one for the trip. I also know she's been wanting a universal studios pass so I'm thinking about getting her one, or else a gift card for the movies because she likes to go there with her friends too.

What I'm looking for is advice on what to get her, mostly more specific things! I have a general idea of some stuff she likes (list below) but I would really appreciate it if anybody has any recommendations!

We talked a bit and turns out we have a bit in common regarding interests. I’m not always great at reading emotions through text, but it was clear he was pretty excited about this.

I matched with a few guys who wanted to meet later in the week, but that wouldn’t work for me. I needed it now and I was flying out soon, so there wouldn’t be enough time.

Then I matched with this one guy I’m pretty sure I even superliked because he was exactly my type. Tall as fuck. Great body. Loved pets. Same values. Wanted fun, intimacy, no commitment. Perfect. I told him, let’s meet tonight — and we did. We went to an arcade bar, had drinks, food, and played games. The conversation flowed easily, at least for me. After a short walk, we went to his car to “warm up”, and I knew what I was there for. We made out for a bit and I told him I wasn’t doing it in his car, we should go to his place instead. He said he lived an hour away and asked if that was okay. I said fuck yeah. So sleeping over was clearly on the table. I asked if he was fine with it, and he said yes.

We were playful the whole time. I even joked about him murdering me, but I had the advantage because no one knew who he was with. He told me to text my sister his address. He even showed me his driver’s licence before that, so I wasn’t worried.

We got to his place, he showed me around, and then we did the deed. It was insane — the best sex I’ve ever had. Everything just worked. He was big, strong, confident, all the spots were hit, the dirty talk was on point — everything.

The next morning, he made me breakfast. We cuddled, watched a film, napped, smoked, cuddled again. We were glued to each other. Skin always touching. Sniffing each other. Making out for long stretches even without having sex. Then sex again. And again. It felt like every 30 minutes.

He drove me home after, bought me Starbucks on the way, and we held hands the whole drive. I took over his phone’s Spotify and he didn’t mind at all.

He wanted to see me again that same night, so I Uber’d an hour to him. I brought him snacks from my culture we talked about, plus a spare hand cream since we’d joked about his dry hands. He seemed to like the gesture — he kept the hand cream in his car and I watched him use it constantly.

We watched Netflix, had more sex, and talked deeply about everything — family, grief, dogs, work, life. Then more sex. The next morning, I worked while he slept, then he woke up, made me coffee, and we went right back to cuddling and having sex again.

Three days before I had to leave, he said he wanted to take me out to dinner before I flew home. After work, he took me to a bar near my place. And this is where everything gets confusing.

He regularly talked about wanting to visit me in my home country. That night, he pinky-promised he’d visit in February. I didn’t care if this was just sex or him lovebombing — but I didn’t realise this was part of the game. He didn’t have to say any of that or make me hopeful. I knew we were both there for sex and intimacy for a short time. He could’ve just stopped.

But he kept going. He told me I was the girl of his dreams. That if it weren’t for the distance, he’d pursue me. That I was amazing. And sure, fine, but he didn’t need to pile it on. He even brought up FaceTiming after work once I got home so we could catch up. I DIDN’T ASK FOR THAT. None of it was me initiating — it was him saying all of it.

After dinner, we had a great night. We took pictures together — he suggested it and said he wanted “cute photos” from our last night. The next day, we were still talking. Even on the day I flew out, he was messaging me at the airport telling me to text him on my layover because he’d be awake. So I did, because I thought he meant it.

Since landing back home on Monday, it’s been radio silence. Nothing. He even posted on Instagram six hours ago but didn’t bother replying to me. This same guy who said “you have my word”, who said he’d book a one-way flight in November, who said he’d come see how long he could stay.

This is my first time being ghosted. I’ve hooked up before, but hookups never hurt because I knew my boundaries. I kept conversations shallow and didn’t let myself get comfortable. But this one made me let my guard down because I thought he was genuinely into me. Turns out, he was just better at the game. And I got played.

I’m so hurt. And as much as I want to double text and ask why, I know I shouldn’t.

EDIT: I know words mean nothing. But it’s just annoying now that I remember any of it. He told me after sex (😂) how he thinks he might be in love lol. And when we were getting out of his car during our date night, I told him “I was gonna cook something for you but you might fall in love with me” and he was like “I already am” and was just brushing it off cause I know it could be just bshit and lovebombing.

I've only been here about two months and I'm still trying to make a good impression, but something happened yesterday that's been bothering me. 

In our office, there's this woman B who is very thin and follows a strict vegan diet. She's always talking about her ""metabolically blessed"" body and how she doesn't eat ""real food."" Two of my male coworkers, C and D, constantly make fun of her for this. 

Yesterday, I was in the breakroom getting coffee when I overheard them arguing. C and D were teasing B about her weight, saying things like ""thin people just suck"" and ""you're probably too thin to even poop."" They were making really crude jokes about the bathroom and accusing her of leaving messes there. B was getting really defensive and kept repeating that she was ""metabolically blessed"" and that they were just jealous. 

I stood there awkwardly not knowing what to do. On one hand, B can be pretty judgmental about food and has made comments about my lunch choices before. On the other hand, C and D were being really mean and making inappropriate comments about her body and bathroom habits. 

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and I said something like, ""Can we not talk about people's bodies and bathroom habits at work? It's making everyone uncomfortable."" 

They all just stared at me. B looked shocked, C and D looked annoyed. The rest of the day was super awkward and nobody would talk to me. 

Later, my manager called me into her office and said that I was new and shouldn't get involved in ""established office dynamics."" She suggested I focus on my work and not make waves. 

Now I'm wondering if I overstepped. Maybe I should have just stayed out of it since B isn't always nice either. But the way they were talking about bodies and bathroom stuff felt really wrong to me. 

My boyfriend says I did the right thing and that they were being bullies, but my mom says I should mind my own business at work until I've been there longer. 

I'm just so anxious about going in tomorrow. What if they all hate me now? What if this affects my job? I really need this job and I can't afford to look for another one right now. 

tl;dr: I told my coworkers to stop body shaming each other at work and now everyone is giving me the silent treatment and my manager told me not to get involved in office politics. AITA for speaking up?",1,1763010660.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1ovsjgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/picopresso/comments/1ovsjgu/picopresso_vs_pixapresso_thoughts/,Picopresso vs Pixapresso Thoughts,"So I got a Picopresso and a Pixapresso a few days ago, and have been tasting testing each back to back giving each a fair shot using the included tools. I thought it might be useful to write my thoughts for someone considering the same options as me.

Initially the Pico is clearly superior in quality. It and it’s tools are made of either stainless steel or high quality plastic and the Pixa is just all regular old plastic with only a couple parts being steel. Even the Pico’s packaging experience was better, and it comes with a nice case while the Pixa has a string bag. (Side note: the packaging was all environmentally friendly between both, and I didn’t expect that but it’s appreciated.)

There are some quality issues with the Pixa that I did not experience with the Pico. I did not grind super finely for these tests, in fact I dialed it back from what I put in my real machine.  However, the Pixa’s filter top kept getting grounds stuck in the holes that were difficult or annoying to clean out, while the Pico did not have that issue. 

And the tools.. the Pixa’s tools are just… shit. I could not imagine using it on an airplane or traveling. Another minor issue is everything necessary fits inside the Pico, while for the Pixa the tamp/spoon and funnel cannot fit inside the machine. Of course the Pico has its single needle WDT tool if we can call it that, but better one than none like the Pixa.

Also on my last night of testing (tonight) the battery was out on the Pixa and I needed to wait a solid 20 minutes to charge to pull a double shot… not great. Along those lines, I would never use the Pixa to boil water since it takes almost all the charge to do so and then 2-1/2 hrs to charge to full. Nice to have the option I suppose, but you would really need to justify going through that hassle. Forget to plug it in and next day, no coffee till you wait 1-1/4 hrs to charge (the amount of time to charge to be able to boil I believe). I actually ordered from AliExpress a $30 Xiaomi Mijia Travel Kettle 2, which would work on airplanes and cars as well as office, for the price difference between the two machines (albeit I don’t think I needed to and might return).

Quality and battery aside, the Pixa is very easy to make decent espresso with. I’ll admit that I did not make good espresso with the Pico my first few tries, but tonight I made a pretty decent shot which I can tell will get better as I use it. The Pixa however made pretty much the same shot quality and taste-wise with more crema with the pressurized basket with just a button click. Both seemed a couple steps below my usual at-home shot, but I can tell the Pico can obviously do better than what I pulled from it. It’s not a machine but it’s surprisingly close haha.

TLDR:
Honestly last couple days I had Pixapresso boxed up to be returned but how easy it is to pull a decent shot with a button kept making me come back. I intended to use these at work at my desk so easiness was a factor to me. At the end of it, the real decision is this: are you willing to sacrifice build and espresso quality for ease of use, or are you willing to sacrifice ease of use for build and espresso quality. If you are considering getting a portable espresso machine because you really like espresso that much… go for the Pico, the quality one. The nail in the coffin was wanting to pull a shot, and needing to wait.",1,1763010540.0,picopresso,2,1.0,False
1ovsip2,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1ovsip2/trying_costco_bagels_in_japan_no_oven_no_toaster/,"Trying Costco Bagels in Japan (No Oven, No Toaster Life 🍞)","The other day, I went to Costco (in Japan) for the first time and bought a pack of bagels.
(I’m Japanese and live in Japan.)

Since I don’t have a toaster or an oven at home, I actually asked Reddit in my previous post how I should eat them.

Anyway, I tried several methods, so here are my thoughts.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/s/nTO2kON0iq

First Impression

At first, I thought American bagels looked much denser and heavier than Japanese ones.
But when I actually ate them, the taste wasn’t that different.

Japanese bagels tend to be a bit more chewy, I think.

Some people in the comments said Costco bagels are “fake” because real bagels are boiled before being baked — apparently Costco skips the boiling step.

But honestly, they still taste good.



How I Cooked Them

Since I don’t have an oven or toaster, I let them thaw naturally.
When I was in a hurry, I used the microwave defrost mode and then toasted them on a frying pan.

A lot of people told me “Just buy a toaster!” but my place is small and I’m a minimalist, so for now, no toaster.

Also, I don’t even have a fish grill (which many Japanese stoves usually come with) 
But in Japan, especially for single-person households, not having an oven or a fish grill is actually pretty normal!


About Butter

Many people recommended butter, so I went to the supermarket—
but butter has gotten expensive lately.
So I skipped it.
(I also avoid margarine since it seems unhealthy.)

I’m usually a rice person anyway, so I don’t normally keep butter at home.



Bagels in Japan?

I wanted to compare Costco’s with Japanese bagels,
but I checked two supermarkets and neither of them sold bagels.

I didn’t realize bagels were that uncommon here since I usually eat rice, not bread.

You can get a bagel sandwich at Doutor, a popular Japanese coffee chain,
but honestly, I can’t think of any other places in Japan that have bagels on the menu.

Too bad, I really wanted to do a Japan–US bagel comparison.



Taste Test

Overall, they were pretty good!
Here’s what I tried:

・Olive oil (lots of people said “no,” but I liked it)

・Cream cheese (French one from Costco 🇫🇷)
・Melted cheese

・Melted cheese + honey
・
Plain

All of them were nice, but plain + corn soup was surprisingly good!
Since bagels soak up moisture, the soup really balanced it out.

I also brought one to work and toasted it there — definitely tasted better.

Maybe I should get a toaster after all…
But since I rarely eat bread, I’m still not sure.



I bought a pack of 8 bagels and now I’m already down to the last one.

Thanks!

Some highlights:
-  West of El Camino Real and borders Hillsborough, so the neighborhood is one of the most beautiful/safest on the peninsula with multi-million dollar homes next door and a special Hillsborough police.
-  5 minutes walking distance to downtown San Mateo which has coffee shops, restaurants, Fedex/UPS/USPS, Bank of America, public library, grocery shops, Caltrain, etc. 
- Top-floor (only 2 stories) and very few bordering walls because it is a corner unit. 
- It's west-facing so it gets plenty of light. 
- Tucked in away from the street, and the front door opens directly to the outside with its own address (like a single family home, no unit numbers or intermediate hallways to walk through).
- 100% hardwood floors
- HOA is $875 due to it being a newer luxury building (built 2005).
- 2 parking spots in the downstairs covered gated garage.

[I messed up and it feels like my wife will never move past it. Should I keep letting her punish me or is it time to say enough is enough?](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/s/0PbOqJQtKw): **August 8, 2025**

OOP, 35M, shares the breakdown of his marriage after losing his job due to the workplace conflict. His wife, who warned him the job would end badly, became the sole provider while pregnant, and their relationship deteriorated. After being asked to leave, he entered therapy, found new work, including three jobs, and was allowed to return home, though he now sleeps in the basement and has no emotional or physical connection with his wife. Despite his efforts to regain trust, she continues to criticize and dismiss him, often siding with her mother over him. A recent argument regarding their son’s minor post-surgery fever made him realize how little respect she has for him, leading him to question whether he’s truly making amends or being punished in a marriage that may already be beyond saving.

&nbsp;

[Anxiety that turns to panic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/s/ntiqgl5KsV): **August 10, 2025 (two days later)**

OOP stayed home while his family went out of town for the weekend and is now spiraling with anxiety before they get back. He is obsessing over whether he did enough around the house, making multiple lists to justify it, but nothing helps. When he stopped distracting himself with Reddit, his anxiety turns into panic, and he is aware that doomscrolling isn’t a healthy coping mechanism. He is stuck in his head, feeling guilty and unable to calm down.

&nbsp;

[UPDATE: I messed up and it feels like my wife will never move past it. Should I keep letting her punish me or is it time to say enough is enough?](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/s/CcCocoKNjf): **August 12, 2025 (two days later from the previous post, four days from the OG post)** 

OOP updated and clarifies he’s been working hard since moving back home, holding down three jobs, managing childcare, cooking, and helping with household chores, and feels he’s doing his share, despite criticism. When his family returned from a weekend trip, OOP tried to talk with his wife about cutting back on work and starting marriage counseling. She dismissed the counseling idea and accused him of wanting to avoid responsibility when he suggested working less, explaining that she plans to reduce her hours and relies on his income. She mentioned his basement sleeping arrangement is partly due to his late-night work schedule but didn’t elaborate on other reasons. OOP brought up counseling again, and his wife reluctantly agreed to a Zoom “intro” session with a female counselor, though she avoids intimacy and is uninterested in date nights, saying they “aren’t there right now.” OOP feels lost on how to express concerns without sounding defensive and admits he has no one else to talk to.

&nbsp;

**Editor's note: after the update, OOP made a post onto a different subreddit regarding a question about how long do the couples try before calling it quits. That subreddit does not allow their posts to be cross-posted so I will not include the post here in the BoRU per the sub rules.**

[I didn't realize how much my family doesn't care until I came to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/FJ7gn6vhRs): **August 15, 2025 (three days later from the update post)**

OOP explains on how sharing his marital struggles on Reddit has made him realize just how isolated he is in real life. He said redditors have been supportive and offered advice. Their marriage remains strained, and OOP feels emotionally abandoned by his parents, his father distant and cold, his mother more invested in maintaining access to her grandkids and her relationship with OOP’s wife than supporting him. OOP describes the lifelong pattern of being blamed or dismissed by family, childhood bullying to adult failures, and now sees how little emotional values he holds to them than what he provides. He feels invisible, resigned to being ignored as his wife and parents carry on without him, concluding that it’s easier to hide away in the basement.

OOP recalls a tense family outing to the zoo resulting with him snapping at his mother after she referred to his wife as a “single parent.” OOP, who was struggling through a rocky marriage after losing his job and being temporarily kicked out, recently moved back home but still lives in the basement and feels unwelcome in his family. At the outing, he felt excluded and dismissed by both sets of parents, culminating in his mother’s comment implying that his wife was essentially raising their kids alone. Hurt and humiliated, OOP lost his composure, grabbed his son, and walked off, sarcastically remarking that he should get “some practice as a single parent.” His mother left in tears, and both his wife and in-laws told him he overreacted. OOP is questioning whether his emotional response was justified or if he was the one in the wrong for letting his frustration boil over.

OOP reviews on the first marriage counseling session with his wife, “Carrie,” following a prior incident when he snapped at his mother. Carrie apologized for his mother’s hurtful “single parent” comment, saying she never viewed him that way and still trusted his commitment as a father, the kind words she’s offered in a long time. Counseling revealed deeper issues: Carrie admitted she doesn’t know if she loves or respects OOP anymore, as her feelings are buried under resentment. She revealed her resentment stems not only from OOP losing his job, also from years of her family’s disapproval, including her mother’s and sister’s belief that OOP wasn’t right for her and suspicions during her pregnancy that he was cheating with his longtime female friend, “Ellie.” Though Carrie later realized he hadn’t cheated and defended him to her family, OOP’s job loss “proved them right” in her eyes, reigniting that bitterness. The session ended with small progress: OOP was allowed to move from the basement to the guest room, and Carrie agreed to let him think about her request to reduce her work hours for weekly “girls’ nights.”

&nbsp;

[AITAH for asking my wife to choose our family over hers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Cp0NsTSGSC): **August 29, 2025 (one week later)** 

OOP mentioned after the tense marriage counseling session where the therapist encouraged him and his wife to spend more time together, new conflicts arose over holiday weekend plans. Every year, Carrie’s family gathers at her parents’ lake camp, but given the strained relationship between OOP and his in-laws, especially after learning they’ve disapproved of him, he thought it would be better for his wife and kids to stay home so they could reconnect privately. Carrie began packing for the lake trip without including him, saying she wanted to “spend the weekend with [her] family.” OOP tried to use calm “I feel” statements, suggesting that her going without him contradicted their counselor’s advice. Carrie took that as an ultimatum, accused him of being controlling, and locked herself in their bedroom. OOP feels conflicted, unsure if he was genuinely trying to prioritize their family or if, as Carrie says, he was being an AH by guilt-tripping her for wanting time with her relatives.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ZhoaGtt8To): **September 5, 2025 (one week later)** 

After a tense argument about Carrie choosing between spending holiday weekend with her family or with OOP and their kids, she unexpectedly apologized and offered a compromise, spending one night at her family’s camp before returning to spend the rest of the weekend together. The time they spent as a family went well and almost normal, but tensions resurfaced when Carrie brought up wanting regular “girls’ nights” with her mother and sister, both of whom dislike him. She justified it by saying her sister’s husband had left after she cheated during one of those nights, and she wanted to support her sister through the breakup. Though OOP tried to stay calm, he felt uneasy that his wife arranged her schedule for the outings and both she and their therapist saw it as healthy progress. Carrie heads out for her first girls’ night, OOP admits he’s trying to convince himself he’s fine with it, he feels anxious and uncertain.

&nbsp;

[Why do only the negatives linger?](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThrowRANoRespectWife/s/NhD1qyaHMN): **September 8, 2025 (three days later)**

OOP vents about feeling emotionally exhausted and conflicted while waiting for an emergency therapy session. He explains that despite receiving supportive comments on Reddit, the only ones that stick with him are negative ones, those accusing him of being the real problem, a bad husband, or an abuser. Criticism eats away at him, leaving him doubting himself and feeling unworthy of love or compassion. He admits he almost posted in an abuse support subreddit after realizing how poorly he’s been treated, but a heated exchange with another Redditor sent him spiraling again, making him question everything. Now, OOP feels ashamed, needy, and frustrated with himself for caring so much about strangers’ opinions and wonders why it’s so hard to silence the self-blame and thinks he deserves better.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/QoG08N4rMO): **September 11, 2025 (three days later)**

OP shares in an emotional update, that his young son fell down the stairs and broke his arm, with doctors also checking for possible head trauma. He recounts the terrifying moment, how he was carrying his daughter and couldn’t reach his son in time, and now feels crushed with guilt despite no one, including his wife or in-laws, blaming him. His wife rushed back from a work event to be with them at the hospital, and for once, both sides of the family managed to come together peacefully in support of their injured child. OOP writes from the children’s hospital lounge, emotionally drained, trying to make sense of what happened while battling intense self-blame. He later adds his son has been released, is in good spirits, and is proudly showing off his cast, bringing a small bit of relief after harrowing few days.

&nbsp;

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/acRg7OiAPa): **September 23, 2025 (12 days later)**

OP shares Child Protective Services was called on him for alleged neglect after his son’s fall, but the hospital wasn’t the one who reported it, meaning a family member likely did. He and Carrie are being cautious about confronting anyone until they confirm who made the report. OOP has spoken with a lawyer and is in intensive therapy, where he’s confronting longstanding issues with self-worth, honesty, and his need to defend himself. 

&nbsp;

**Editor's note: OOP has made a separate post onto a different subreddit after Update #3 regarding his son's fall accident incident. That subreddit does not allow their posts to be cross posted so I will not add OOP's post here** 

&nbsp;

[Explaining it to a partner](https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/s/pkT9QVizFm): **October 2, 2025**

OOP had a breakthrough in therapy, finally recognizing his parents, especially his mother, as emotionally immature. After years of minimizing their behavior and convincing himself that it “wasn’t that bad,” he began to understand how their emotional neglect shaped him. When he tried to explain this realization to Carrie, the conversation fell apart; he couldn’t express it clearly, felt like his examples sounded weak, and ended up feeling foolish. 

&nbsp;

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThrowRANoRespectWife/s/3uc52JptSU): **October 8, 2025 (six days later)**

OOP reveals the CPS report accusing him of neglecting his son was made by his own mother, not his in-laws, as he and his wife had suspected. After confronting his parents, his mother admitted to filing the report, claiming she believed he had hurt his son and citing a long-held (and false) belief that he had cheated on his wife years ago. OOP discovered his MIL once told his mother about the supposed affair but never clarified it wasn’t true, allowing misunderstandings to fester for years. The revelation left OP devastated, estranged from his parents, and distant from Carrie as he struggles to process the betrayal. Continuing individual and marriage counseling, he made progress in recognizing his parents’ emotional immaturity, and even quit one of his three jobs, his first major independent decision in a long time.

&nbsp;

[Parents think I'm incompetent](https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/s/y8EnHfjU5r): **October 14, 2025 (six days later from Update #4)**

My current relationship with my parents is a complicated mess that likely won't get better any time soon. But I've started noticing some patterns through therapy and I've come to the conclusion that my parents have always thought that I'm basically incompetent. Their overriding opinion of me is that I can't really do anything on my own and if someone (them, my wife) isn't there to ""guide"" me, I will fail at almost everything.

Any time I don't listen to them or follow their way of doing things, there's an automatic assumption that it will all go wrong. And it seems like there's some truth to it. I didn't listen to my wife when she told me I wasn't a good fit for a job and I ended up being asked to resign. I chose to ignore my parents' advice on my choice of college and major and I ended up needing to change majors twice and transfer to a different college. My son recently had a seizure that led to a fall down the stairs and my mother's immediate and unchanging assumption was/is that, at best, I failed to keep a good enough eye on him or, at worst, I actually caused both things to happen through poor parenting.

I could give you a list (I'm sure my parents have one) of other such evidence. But I can't figure out if I'm actually incompetent, if they just get in my head and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, or if I've just been trained over the years to the point where I actually believe it.

Anyone else ever dealt with parents thinking that they're too incompetent to manage anything on their own?

&nbsp;

[A little light in the dark](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThrowRANoRespectWife/s/sc7J4RIMXl): **October 16, 2025 (two days later)**

I'm sitting here in the dark in my daughter's nursery (not sure what age it goes from nursery to bedroom) because she's having a rough night and will only sleep with one of us in the room with her. We had to do MC tonight via video call as we've lost our primary babysitters and I'm kind of grateful for my daughter's 'insomnia' tonight as it's given me a reason to sit in the quiet and try to process.

Apparently, I've ended up on TikTok and YouTube and BoRU and the wiki sub. And I'm mildly proud of myself that I haven't tried defending myself on either sub (baby steps, right?) but it's given me a lot to think about as I'm getting comments and msgs from people who are just now seeing some of posts. It's weird seeing people arguing about whether I should have just called the doctor (my very first post) or whether I'm a misogynist for not getting along with my female coworker. It feels like years since any of that was my biggest issue.

But as weird as it's been to see so many comments on things that have been buried by more recent crap and as rough as MC was tonight (therapist had some choice words for Carrie and I almost felt like jumping in to defend her) and as hard as it's been ignoring every attempt my parents make at contacting us, I had a moment tonight that felt like relief and breathing again. And since I only ever share the angst and drama and catastrophe, I wanted to share something good.

Carrie saw how hard I've been taking things with my mom (which, based on the Reddit Cares msgs I've gotten, came through pretty clearly in my one recent comment) and she understood that there wasn't much she could do, seeing as how tangled up in it she is. And whether we stay together or not, tonight she showed she still has some care for me.

She called Ellie. She called her and she asked her to come here to see me. And so, my best friend will be here this weekend. Carrie already made us all a reservation at the same restaurant we had our wedding reception at and she's offered to either take the kids for a day so Ellie and I can hang or to make herself scarce so our son can spend some time with Aunt E and I won't feel like I need to walk on eggshells.

I haven't told Ellie all of what's happened (and I'm going to get a stern talking to about that) but it's a better feeling than I would have imagined to know I'll have at least a few days with someone who is one hundred percent 'team me'.

It's nice to have something to look forward to and to have some time to just sit in the dark and hold my daughter's hand and pretend I'm just a typical dad doing typical dad stuff.

Just wanted to share.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update: AITAH for asking my wife to choose between her family and ours](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditor_Updates/comments/1oqaj5o/update_aitah_for_asking_my_wife_to_choose_between/): **November 6, 2025 (eight days later)**

If you’re interested in how we got here: [my last real update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditor_Updates/comments/1o1ivs7/update_aitah_for_asking_my_wife_to_choose_between/) And all the rest are in my post history.

I realized today that it's been almost a month since I gave an ‘official’ update. A lot has been going on, including Ellie’s visit, a few breakthroughs in therapy, and trying to manage a household with a toddler with a serious medical condition. I’m still processing/working through a ton, but since Ellie was here, I had a little less need to process in “public”, as it were.

But now she’s gone back home and things are sort of shifting back to where they were before the seizure and CPS except that I don’t really feel like I’m looking at any of it the same way, whether that’s good or bad, I don’t honestly know yet.

We still don’t have any real answers as to what’s causing my son’s seizures. But his new medication regimen has them more or less under control and we’re cautiously optimistic while still taking some extra precautions. So far, so good on that front. He’s handling it all far better than either of his parents are, I can tell you that.

I got a few comments and msgs asking about whether I ever spoke to BIL after he reached out.  We had a brief chat over coffee the day before Ellie arrived. He and I have never been close - he is or was the golden child son-in-law and we have absolutely nothing in common - but, apparently, he still felt like it was his “duty” to warn me about some things, so I could be more prepared than he was. Turns out that my SIL has been financially abusive/controlling toward him for quite a while and when he confronted her about a credit card that he didn’t know she had opened, she went ballistic and that was what led her to the bar and a guy she used to know and it went from there. He didn’t expand much on SIL’s cheating so I’m still not clear if it was a one-time thing or a long-term affair (Carrie’s had conflicting answers) but really, he just wanted to give me a heads up so I could check our finances in case Carrie had been following her sister’s lead in that regard.

So, I did check. And that led to a blowup in MC because I found some… irregularities. No secret credit cards or anything like that. But Carrie’s been spending considerably more than I realized and some of that spending was actually giving, as in giving SIL cash that I suspect was her way of paying for her cheating related expenses so BIL wouldn’t catch on. It didn’t go particularly well when I called Carrie out on it during counseling and it went worse when our therapist essentially took my side and gave her some tough love that was more tough than it was love. The phrases ‘family loyalty’, ‘she needed help’, and ‘you made the choice to get fired so I get to make the choice on how to spend my money’ were all thrown around. 

To be fair: Carrie apologized later for everything she said, though she stopped short of apologizing for what she did and her sister’s cheating has become a bigger issue in MC than I ever thought it would. We’ve had three sessions since the blowup and somehow they all keep circling back to the cheating and all our talking about what Carrie knew and what she didn’t feels a lot like dancing around the possibility of her following in her sister’s footsteps and the money stuff being the first step down that path.  And that somehow always manages to lead right back to her original accusations against me, the ones that led to her mom snitching to my mom but then never following up with the truth.

There were some commenters who suggested that Carrie might have been setting some kind of ‘trap’ by inviting Ellie. I’m not going to say you were right but, well, you were right. Sort of. It was more of a preemptive strike, a ‘see, I trust you’ and ‘look, I can still do things that suggest I might still love you’ move as the day after Ellie left, Carrie broached the subject of how her mother telling my mother that I had cheated had played a role in my mom reporting me to CPS (there’s a sentence I never thought I’d write.) Basically, my wife asked me to be the bigger person (like she’d been by inviting Ellie) and to chalk that up to an innocent mistake on my MIL’s part and now that it was all water under the bridge because everyone knew the truth, maybe my MIL and I could have a sit down and try to bury the hatchet. 

I had like six good lines about where I might like to bury that hatchet, but I didn’t actually use any of them and that was in no small part to being too fucking shocked to hear it described as water under the bridge to find my voice. 

Carrie did her best to frame it as all of us moving forward “for the kids” since it seemed like our son and daughter might soon only have one set of grandparents, assuming that I was going to go no contact with my parents. Someone asked on one of my other posts why it wasn’t ‘easy’ for me to just cut them off and this turns out to be one of the big reasons: 

\*If I go no contact and Carrie and I stay together, then my entire family will be her family and I think I’ve spelled out all the reasons that would be an incredibly bad idea for me.

\*If I go no contact and Carrie and I divorce, then I’ve got no one except a best friend who is thousands of miles away and two kids who I’ll only see some of the time. 

My therapist suggested that that might have been my mom’s plan all along, or at least a consideration - the idea that I’ll roll over and forgive and continue to play my role because I’m incapable of being alone or standing up for myself. She took an action that was so insane because she fully believed there would be no consequences to it, at least not for her. 

Not to speak poorly of myself, but I have to admit that wouldn’t have been an unreasonable calculation by my mother. And since I haven’t ‘officially’ gone no contact yet, she probably thinks that it’s only a matter of time before I come crawling back.

A month ago, she might have been right. But I’ve been digging down into everything related to my parents in therapy and doing all my ‘homework’, which has essentially been a lot of journaling (some of which ended up as a Reddit post) and talking to my inner child and confronting the pain without actually confronting the people who caused it. Turns out that all my posting on here was me doing some of that in terms of my marriage even though I didn’t realize it at the time. And that, it seems, is a pattern: me not realizing things. While Ellie was here, she and I talked a lot and she pointed out some things (in much less gentle ways than my therapist does) that I hadn’t noticed, some patterns that exist in my relationships with my parents and with Carrie. Ellie described them as patterns of neglect, at best, and patterns of abuse, at worst.

I pushed back and resisted that, at first. But when I shared it with my therapist, expecting her to agree with me, she guided me into considering it a light I hadn’t thought of before. She asked me, point blank, who the person I trust most in the world is (Ellie) and then she asked me if I trusted her that much, why wasn’t I trusting her judgement, why was I fighting so hard against everything Ellie was trying to tell me.

My answer: because Ellie’s supposed to be on my side so, of course, she’d see it all in a way that made me look good or like the victim so how could I trust such a clearly biased opinion? And then my therapist asked me if I felt so strongly that I couldn’t or shouldn’t trust a biased or self-serving opinion, then why was I so dead set on trusting Carrie’s opinion or my mother’s. 

I had no good answer for her. Hell, I had no answer at all for her. And I still don’t. But I need to find one, as that’s my therapeutic homework for next session: to try and find a reason that I can actually defend for why I will just accept my wife or my mom’s views of me without question, but refuse to consider that my best friend might see things more clearly than either of them do. I’ve been working on it since Tuesday morning and so far I’ve got nothing which, I suspect, is the point.

That’s where I’m at, if anyone still cares. And I do want to say thank you to everyone who reached out with comments or messages on my other posts, especially those who shared experiences with their own families. I haven’t ever really talked about any of this before, so it’s helped a lot to hear that I’m not unique and while that’s depressing to an extent (why can’t we have nice families?) it’s helping me to feel slightly less anxious about it all. I know I don’t reply to messages, but I read them all and they mean more than you know. 

tl;dr: SIL was financially abusive, my wife gave her money and made me out to be the bad guy for being upset. Carrie wants me to make up with her mom after the cheating accusations. I haven't gone NC with my parents yet because I'm afraid of being alone and Ellie and my therapist both think there are patterns of abuse in my relationships.

Years later, living abroad, I get it.
I used to ignore “small” spends, coffees, quick rides, snacks, random subscriptions,  because they didn’t seem like much. But they added up faster than rent.

When I finally started tracking every expense, I saw where the leaks were. It wasn’t about being stingy, it was about respect. Respect for what I worked for, and what I let slip away unnoticed.

I still think about that crumpled note. It looked worthless, but it taught me the value of keeping track in its own way. ",1,1763009951.0,ExpatWealth,0,1.0,False

I have completed the long and tough job of digging up all the grass, weeds and turf and what-have-you of my (old) new house. It is a clay soil that unfortunately has quite a bit of debris in it (plastic pegs, glass, building bits etc.) I have since loaded it into the three compost pallet bins and have just let it sit there  until i worked out what to do with it. 
I have added handfuls of gypsum to help it break down and kept it covered with a coffee bag and builders plastic to keep in the warmth over winter. There are bits of other greens in there but mainly just the grass and weeds that were solarised over summer. Yesterday i added some mulch (4th pic) and did my best to dig it in and turn it all.

My questions are, in no particular order….

What should i do with all of this turf and clay that now appears to slowly be breaking down? 

What can i do to speed up the process without too much aerating? They are currently full to top.

If the soil is contaminated i.e. lead or other metals, is it doomed forever? (Results for this test tale 6-8 weeks currently)

1ovsaru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herblore/comments/1ovsaru/how_tulsi_grounds_my_winter_days/,How Tulsi Grounds My Winter Days,"I’ve been using Tulsi (Holy Basil) in my daily routine for quite some time, and it’s become one of those things that feels good on every level. Now that winter has settled in, it feels even more grounding. It’s not just a cup of tea; it’s warmth, calm, and ritual all in one.

**Balancing Ritual**  
As the mornings get colder, starting the day with a steaming mug of Tulsi tea feels like a quiet reset. It doesn’t give that sharp caffeine buzz like coffee but instead helps the body and mind find their natural rhythm. On cozy winter evenings, I’ll often make another cup to unwind. There’s something about that earthy, herbal aroma that makes the season feel a little softer and more balanced.

**Stress + Mental Clarity**  
Tulsi is an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body adapt to stress rather than just covering it up. Over time, I’ve noticed I’m calmer, less reactive, and more focused, even when things get hectic. During the darker months, when the pace slows and energy dips, Tulsi feels like gentle support, helping me stay clear-headed and steady.

**Spiritual Side**  
If you’ve ever been around Tulsi plants in India, you know there’s something sacred about them. People tend to them with care, pray near them, and treat them almost like a member of the family. Keeping a Tulsi plant on my windowsill through the winter brings a little life and warmth indoors. Drinking the tea before meditation helps me settle in faster, especially on those still, quiet nights when the world outside feels hushed under the cold.

**How I use it:**

* Morning Tulsi tea to start chilly days feeling balanced
* Evening Tulsi infusion to relax and unwind
* A Tulsi plant on the windowsill to bring calm, green energy inside
* Tulsi oil in a diffuser during meditation for extra warmth and grounding

**Bottom line:** Tulsi isn’t about quick fixes. It’s about finding rhythm and peace through the season. In winter, it becomes more than just tea; it’s comfort, balance, and a small daily ritual that helps me stay centered when everything outside feels cold and still.

I’ve visited friends in flatbush and somewhat know the vibe but just not too familiar as I haven’t spent enough time there.

I haven’t told anyone in my life yet but I need to talk about it somewhere.

So I (21F) have been dating my bf (24M) for only around 5 months but we moved quite fast in our relationship. We met on a night out and talked for probably about 3 hours straight, exchanged phone numbers, went on a date 2 days later, and were inseparable after that. In retrospect I can see that we were both just very lonely people who had a lot in common and attached ourselves to one another. It felt great at first but went sour at around month 3. He travels frequently for work and it started to take a toll on our relationship. We started arguing much more and I truly just felt like he wasn’t nearly as present and it fucking killed me. We went from spending every moment talking to each other, going on dates, having sleepovers, him buying me flowers, gifts, sending me money every morning for coffee to us texting maybe 2 or 3 times a day and maybe 1 phone call every couple days while he was on his work trips. When he would come back from them everything would go back to normal but he wasn’t home for an extended period of time for this most recent trip and it was horrible. 

Well he got home on Sunday, went to his house to shower then immediately drove to my place and we spent the night together. We were so excited to see each other and we immediately bounced back to our happy selves but I tried to initiate sex that night and he turned me down which he has never done. He said that he had hurt his back at work and was tired so as much as it felt off to me I just ignored it and we went to sleep. We woke up Monday morning and he went to get us coffee. I was thinking of what we could do today and remembered that I hadn’t done his nails in a while and we could do that. An important thing to note is that though I am not a nail tech I do mine and my friends nails often and will give my bf manicures every once in a while. So he comes back and hands me my coffee and as he does I take a look at his hands and they are freshly manicured. Cuticles pushed back and cut, nails cleaned, and filed. My heart honestly just dropped there because I knew. He has never and would never get his nails done professionally and it was obvious he did not do the himself. We sat down together and I asked him when was the last time he cut his nails. He looked down at them and hesitated. I could see it in his face that he immediately realized that I had noticed his nails. He said that he cleaned them up before he came back home because he wanted them nice for me. I didn’t even entertain the conversation, I just looked at him and his face gave it all away. I asked him if he was really going to lie to me right now and grabbed his phone to which he immediately shot up and tried to take it from me. We were literally pushing each other like little fucking kids and I told him that I was going through it regardless so he could just tell me or I could find out on my own. He broke down in front of me and started crying. Said that he fucked up and went out with his work friends on Saturday and went home with a girl. He said that they didn’t have sex but just “hung out” and she did his nails. I went through his phone while he just sat in front of me with his head in his hands rocking back and forth hyperventilating. I couldn’t find anything then went to his FaceTime call log and saw an unsaved number. Went to his deleted messages and sure enough he was texting a girl. They had almost a thousand messages and had been talking the entire time he was on his work trip and from the first text he sent it seems they met on a dating app. They were sexting and even talked about the sex they had in person as well. I recorded all of it on my phone and just threw his phone at him and told him to leave. He begged me not to do this but my roommate and her boyfriend were home and I told him that I would talk to him when I was ready and that if he didn’t leave I would make my roommates boyfriend kick him out. He made me promise to call or text him. 

It’s been two days since then and I haven’t reached out to him. I have him blocked on everything but he sent a letter to me that I actually think he delivered himself in front of my doorstep professing his undying loyalty to me, swearing that he’d never cheat again,he was so lonely and desperate for anyone, that it was a mistake and he hates himself, and said we could do couples therapy together. I haven’t unblocked him and I know he will keep persisting. I have no idea what to do. I know that I will never trust him ever again but I also don’t feel strong enough to end my relationship with him. I’m trying my hardest not to make contact with him but it’s been so fucking hard. I have contemplated sending it all to his family, friends, and coworkers hoping that he’ll hate me for it and it’ll ruin any chance of us getting back together. So fucking pathetic.

On Saturday (in 3 days!!), one of my favorite bands is coming to town. They have about 39k Spotify listeners but are very well known in their specific niche genre. Music journalism is a lofty dream for me so I threw an email into the void introducing myself and sending some of my written work and video content. I asked if they'd be interested in a brief chat or interview about their new album when they come to town. I viewed it as networking practice and didn't think anything would come of it, especially since they're in the middle of a tour.

Their PR person and a band member confirmed this morning that they're interested and now I'm meeting up with them for an interview Saturday. I'm so insanely shocked and thrilled but I have no good equipment and I've never made content with another person, let alone in an interview setting.

The details are up in the air. They gave me their number and told me to text them the day of the show to set something up. If it's during the day I know a coffee shop we can film at but who knows if it'll be before or after the show, outside, or when it's dark.

I focus mostly on writing so I've been casually filming with my iPhone and editing on my iPad. I just use the built in iPhone mic and camera. For this interview I want something more professional-looking and sounding but adaptable to the environment. I have some wiggle room price-wise, but the more affordable, the better. How should I set up equipment in a public place for an informal interview?

In our email exchange I referred to it as ""a brief conversation/interview"" about their newest album, so I'm not sure what an appropriate length would be, esp considering they're touring and busy. Also, what are your tips for interviewing other people, are there questions you'd recommend, and what are literally any other tips or words of advice?

I honestly didn't think I'd make it this far so now I'm kind of scrambling to have my stuff together by Saturday on top of the nerves. Any and all advice is so appreciated.

That night, Alpha Luke left me naked on the pool table to get revenge for Sera.


The pack warriors laughed, using their cue sticks to measure my legs. Someone poured ice-cold liquor down my nipples.


""Hole in one!"" A guy whistled.


""Luna Evelyn's cunt as the pocket—fuck, who wouldn't want to sink that shot?""


Luke's first love filmed the whole filthy scene, whispering poison in my ear.


""A stand-in will always be just that. Right now? Lying here as everyone's toy—that's what you were made for.""


On the table, I whimpered in pain.


My Alpha's first love whined sweetly:


""I just wanted to fulfill my dream of getting mated to Luke. She's just a stand-in—how dare she refuse me!""


Alpha Luke pulled Sera close, blew a smoke ring, and said coldly:


""She made Sera unhappy. Of course I had to punish her.""


The pack warriors doubled over laughing.


""Don't be mad, Sera. We'll make her beg for mercy! Honestly, Alpha, we're curious—how the hell do you train your mate to be this obedient?""


Luke drawled lazily:


""I buy her vibrators. The dumb bitch thinks I'm taking care of her needs in bed. She's so fucking pleased with herself.""


""That's our Alpha! Devoted only to little Sera! But... aren't you worried she'll find out and break the bond?""


Alpha Luke smirked, smoothly sinking the eight ball with one shot.


""She wouldn't dare. She's an orphan. I made her Luna of the pack, and now she's pregnant. A used thing—who else would want her?""


""Honestly, pregnant she-wolf just smell off. Every night I'm about to puke.""


“This is just a reminder—even if she’s mated to me, she’ll never be above Sera!”


""Alpha, remember when you ordered those packages for her and specifically told the shops not to send them anonymously? She lost her chance at the Elite Tactical Award because of that. Was that for Sera too?""


Luke traced Sera's waist with his fingers, smiling faintly.


""The award was rigged from the start. But if I didn't ruin her reputation first, how could I guarantee Sera wouldn't face gossip after winning?""


Sera looked utterly wronged.


""She said I didn't understand tactics and humiliated me in front of EVERYONE! Luke just taught her a tiny lesson for me!""


My chest tightened.


I suddenly remembered the day dozens of packages filled with sex toys piled up at the academy gates.


The parents looked at me with disgust.


My heart ached as I watched my favorite students transfer out of my classes one by one.


But it never crossed my mind that he did it on purpose.


The laughter in the pool hall continued, but my heart kept sinking.


Luke remembered something, pulled a stack of sex photos from his pocket, and scattered them over my body.


“Fenrir, scatter these photos into every classroom. I want Evelyn expelled from the academy—gone for good, so she can never stand in Sera’s way.”


""Damn, you actually FUCKED in the classroom?! How the hell did you even take these? Luna was completely naked, face fully visible!”


""If those parents see this, they'll lose their fucking minds!""


The hall erupted in laughter and shrieks. My tears wouldn't stop falling.


Luke wasn’t always such a son of a bitch.


Two years ago, before his mother—the former Luna—fell into a coma from a car accident, she begged me to help him secure his position as Alpha.


I gave up the chance to serve as the Elder Council’s Chief Oracle and Historical Chronicler to devote myself to training Blackwood Pack’s warriors day and night.


It wasn't until the night we completed the mating bond that I realized Luke's dick was huge—and his sexual appetite was insatiable.


He bought tons of sex toys and loved dragging me into the classroom after hours to fuck me on the desk.


I always thought the desk turned him on. Turns out, the real reason was to humiliate me—to make me step aside for Sera...


""Alpha, if she apologizes to Sera tonight, should I still send the photos?""


Luke didn't hesitate. ""Sure. You know how heartbroken Sera was when she got kicked out of the bridesmaids' lineup. Sera saved my mom from that car crash. I can't let her feel even a little bit unhappy.""


Sera Frost lowered her lashes guiltily, forcing a faint smile to brush it off.


Fenrir Stone's face twisted with cruelty. He raised the cue stick and jabbed it hard into my body.


""Fucking bitch. She dares to mess with Former Luna's savior? She deserves every bit of this!""


A sharp pain shot through me. I blacked out completely.


The next morning, I woke up in my own bed, my pajamas intact.


Luke had already left to handle pack affairs.


I hid under the covers and sobbed until my body shook. Then, with trembling hands, I called the mating ceremony planner.


""Don't cancel anything for Bridesmaid Sera. Cancel everything for the bride.""


Chapter 2


The person on the other end paused.


""Are you sure, Luna Evelyn?""


No wonder the planner sounded so shocked.


Sera's bridesmaid dress had a train even bigger than my wedding gown, covered in diamonds.


She'd even demanded a 14-carat Oppenheimer pink diamond.


At first, I didn't know who she was.


I had to ask Alpha Luke's beta to find out—she was his childhood sweetheart. His first love.


When I rushed to the planning studio, I walked in just as Sera was trying to add a ""Remembering First Love"" segment to the ceremony.


The planner looked at me helplessly.


""Luke said our memories are too precious. If we don't share them at the wedding, he'll regret it for the rest of his life.""


Sera deliberately emphasized ""rest of his life,"" casually pulling out a photo from her bag.


In the photo, Luke was kissing the top of her head.


But in three years together, he'd barely kissed me at all.


I stared at that photo, my chest tightening. Through gritted teeth, I said:


""No way. And we won't be needing you as a bridesmaid.""


Sera didn't get angry—she smiled.


""No worries. Weddings always have 'surprises,' right?""


When I walked out of the studio, my hands were shaking with rage.


That night, Luke even comforted me:


""You did the right thing. The wedding should be about what you want.""


But when he thought I was asleep, he lowered his voice on the phone:


""Just play along with her for now. I'll make her regret it. Sera, baby, don't cry.""


My chest clenched.


If he loved Sera so much, why did he keep saying he loved me? That I was the one the Moon Goddess chose for him — his one and only true mate?


I suddenly remembered a tactical instructors' meeting at Blackwood Academy—the logistics coordinator, drunk off his ass, letting something slip:


""If it weren't for Luna Evelyn helping Luke solidify his position as Alpha, how the hell could that Omega fraud Sera Frost get hired as an instructor here?""


""Yeah, if Alpha Luke's mother—the former Luna—hadn't forbidden him from mating Sera, it never would've been our Luna's turn.""


An invisible hand squeezed my heart. I couldn't breathe.


So that's it.


I was always the one stuck at the pack handling territory defense while Alpha Luke took Sera to the Regional Pack Council meetings.


The advanced combat strategies I'd stayed up all night developing were handed over to Sera to present—her moment to shine in front of the other Alphas.


I fled home and dialed a number.


""Is the position at the Elder Council still open? Sean, I want to apply.""


Alpha Sean Gallagher's voice was full of surprise.


""Evelyn, your expertise in prophecy interpretation and historical scholarship has always been unmatched. The Council would be honored to have you!""


He paused, his tone turning cautious.


""But the Elder Council is in neutral territory, far from Blackwood Pack. You'd need to relocate for at least a year to serve as Chief Oracle and Historical Chronicler. Have you thought it through?""


I gripped my phone, my eyes landing on the invitation Luke had carelessly tossed onto the coffee table—


Sera Frost's name had somehow been added back into the bridesmaids' lineup.


The men who'd humiliated me were listed as groomsmen.


The gold-embossed lettering stung my eyes.


""I've thought it through. The sooner, the better.""


After hanging up, I started packing.


When the silk scarves spilled out of my closet, it suddenly hit me—


These were nothing but freebies to meet the quota for Sera's designer bags.


I let out a bitter laugh and threw them all in the trash.


When Alpha Luke came home, he saw me curled up on the couch and frowned slightly.


""Why are you sitting here? Are you feeling sick?""


The ache in my body reminded me that everything in the pool hall had been real—not a nightmare.


I kept my head down, exhausted.


""Luke, cancel all those vibrator orders. I don't want them anymore.""


Chapter 3


Luke froze, finally noticing the garbage can overflowing with the sex toys he'd picked out for me.


""Baby, didn't you say you loved how I took care of you in bed? How I made you feel so good when I fucked you with those?""


""I didn't sleep well last night. I woke up with my whole body aching. Do you have any idea why?""


For the sake of three years together—and the pup growing inside me—I'd give him one last chance.


Luke's eyes flickered for a moment before he coaxed me gently:


""Pregnancy probably makes you tired, babe. I'll give you a massage tonight.""


I laughed like a maniac and smashed the carved moonstone pendant he'd made for our third anniversary—a symbol of our mate bond—into pieces.


Luke stared at the shattered fragments for a long time before hesitantly asking:


""Is it the pregnancy making you uncomfortable? Are you just in a bad mood?""


I shook my head and slid a stack of training documents toward him—with a rolled parchment contract tucked inside, inscribed with bond-severance runes.


He signed without even looking, then gently massaged my temples with his fingertips.


""How about I run you a hot bath to relax?""


My stomach churned.


These were the same hands that had scattered my naked photos across the pool hall.


This was the same mouth that had called me used thing.


""I've decided to let Sera be a bridesmaid after all.""


At my words, Luke's hand froze.


""Why the sudden change of heart?""


""I thought about it. I was being too petty.""


""Besides, she saved your mother's life. I shouldn't have been so selfish.""


At the mention of his mother, Luke didn't hesitate. He pulled me into his arms.


""Evelyn, you're so understanding! If Sera hadn't carried my mom in her wolf form for ten miles to get help, my mom wouldn't even have survived to be in a coma...""


I frowned but said nothing.


After the accident, Luke's mother had been unconscious ever since.


The truth of what really happened that day was still unknown.


""Don't worry! I'll stay with you at the pack house during your delivery. I'll take care of you and the pup!""


Just then, Alpha Luke's phone buzzed twice. He let go of me and quickly walked to the balcony.


Through the balcony surveillance feed, I watched Luke speak in a low, soothing voice:


""Sera, I promised you you’d get your way. How about we just keep those photos to ourselves?”


Sera's syrupy voice came through the speaker.


""Oh, come on, Luke. You promised I'd be the only one to receive the Elite Warrior Instructor Award. Besides, once those photos are out, she'll have to resign and stay home to focus on you and the baby. It'll improve your relationship and make me feel better. Win-win, right? Please?""


After a long pause, Alpha Luke indulged her.


""Fine.""


Two minutes later, my phone started ringing like a death knell.


I flinched, and both my phone and my heart hit the floor.


Pack members were gathering at the academy gates, holding printed copies of my explicit photos, demanding my termination.


\[Instructor Frost: u/Instructor Reed, what the hell is this? How could you take such filthy pictures?


Parent Lee: Disgusting! How can someone like this teach our children?!


Parent Silver: I'm filing a complaint with the academy NOW! This morally corrupt woman needs to be kicked out immediately!\]


My teaching career. My reputation. Destroyed in minutes.


When Luke returned to the living room, he glanced at the group chat and sighed.


""Evelyn, I believe you. Tomorrow is Sera's award ceremony anyway. I'll go with you to explain, okay?""


Explain over and over again, only to be cursed at by more and more people.


Exhaustion flooded every inch of my body.


""I don't want to go.""


Luke didn't expect me to refuse. He looked at me in disbelief.


But then his eyes shifted to the mating ring I'd taken off and left on the coffee table. He smiled knowingly.


""Don't worry about our mating ceremony. The invitations are already sent. It'll happen as planned the day after tomorrow.""

The video creation landscape has been a nightmare of fragmented tools and escalating costs… until now.

[**Get VideoExpress AI For Just $49 One-Time → Use Coupon ""SECRET10"" For 10% OFF!**](https://imsuccessconnection.com/VideoExpressAI)

I've spent the last two weeks testing every feature of VideoExpress AI, and I'm going to give you the unfiltered truth about whether this all-in-one platform lives up to the hype. No fluff. No affiliate BS. Just a straight breakdown of what works, what doesn't, and whether it's worth your investment.

# What Exactly Is VideoExpress AI?

VideoExpress AI is a cloud-based video creation platform that combines next-generation AI video generation with a full-featured timeline editor. Think of it as the Swiss Army knife for video creators—you get text-to-video, image-to-video, talking photos, AI inpainting, outpainting, object removal, sound effects generation, and a complete editing suite under one roof.

The key differentiator? **One-time pricing.** No monthly fees. No watermark nonsense. No credits that expire. You pay once and own it forever.

# The Core Features That Actually Matter

Let’s cut through the feature list and focus on what you’ll actually use:

# 1. Text-to-Video Generation (The Main Event)

This is where VideoExpress AI flexes its muscles. You type a prompt—something like ""A photorealistic chicken in a sharp black suit and sunglasses walking through a corporate office""—and the AI generates a 4-second clip (8 seconds in the All-Access tier).

**What impressed me:**

* **Quality rivals Veo 3 and Sora** at a fraction of the cost
* **No copyright headaches**—you own what you create
* **Lightning-fast generation** (typically 30-60 seconds per clip)
* Support for multiple styles: Pixar-style 3D, anime, hand-drawn animation, photorealistic

**Real example I tested:** ""A fluffy cat with a relaxed expression sits comfortably on a car playing guitar."" The result? Shockingly coherent motion, accurate lighting, and zero deformities that plague other AI video tools.

# 2. Image-to-Video Transformation

Upload any static image and bring it to life. The AI analyzes the composition and adds natural, cinematic motion. This is perfect for:

* Product demos
* Storytelling sequences
* Social media reels
* Ecommerce ads

I uploaded a simple product photo of a coffee mug, and within seconds had a 360-degree rotating video with steam rising naturally. No keyframing. No After Effects wizardry.

# 3. Talking Photos (The Secret Weapon)

This feature alone is worth the price of admission. Upload a photo, type your script, and the AI generates realistic lip-sync and facial expressions. It supports **all languages** and includes 800+ ultra-realistic AI voices.

**Key benefits:**

* Turn old photos into engaging video content
* Create multilingual marketing campaigns without hiring voice actors
* Perfect for educational content, author promotions, or social media avatars

I tested this with a headshot and had it speaking Spanish, Mandarin, and English within 5 minutes. The sync accuracy was scary good.

# 4. AI Inpainting & Outpainting

**Inpainting** lets you select any object in your video and transform it. Turn a cat into a lion. Change a house into a castle. Swap outfits. The AI maintains lighting, shadows, and motion physics.

**Outpainting** expands vertical images (9:16) into landscape (16:9) formats, intelligently filling in missing details. This is a massive time-saver for repurposing content across platforms.

# 5. Full-Feature Timeline Editor

Here’s where VideoExpress AI separates from one-trick-pony apps. The built-in timeline editor lets you:

* Merge multiple AI clips into videos up to 5 minutes (Basic) or 10 minutes (All-Access)
* Add transitions, text animations, and effects
* Record your screen, webcam, and voice directly in the app
* Access millions of royalty-free assets (videos, images, music)
* Generate subtitles and captions in multiple languages

No more exporting clips and importing them into Premiere or CapCut. Everything happens in one ecosystem.

# 6. AI Sound Effects Generator

Most AI video tools forget about audio. Not this one. Generate custom sound effects from text prompts or let the AI analyze your video and auto-generate matching audio. The results are surprisingly nuanced—think ambient jungle sounds, epic swooshes, or subtle footstep textures.

# 7. Consistent Character Technology

This is a game-changer for storytelling. Create a character once, and the AI maintains its appearance across different scenes, outfits, and settings. Perfect for:

* Brand mascots
* Educational series
* Long-form narratives
* Marketing campaigns

# Who Is VideoExpress AI Actually For?

After testing, here’s my honest assessment of the ideal user:

**1. Content Creators & YouTubers**  
Generate unique B-roll, create faceless channels, or produce entire videos without showing your face. The 10-minute video length (All-Access) is perfect for YouTube monetization.

**2. Digital Marketers & Agency Owners**  
Create unlimited ad variations, social media content, and client videos with commercial rights. The one-time pricing means pure profit after your first few projects.

**3. Authors & Course Creators**  
Turn book characters into talking promotional videos. Create animated course content without hiring animators.

**4. Small Business Owners**  
Produce product demos, explainer videos, and social media ads without agency fees or subscription bloat.

**5. Freelancers**  
Offer AI video services on Fiverr or Upwork. The commercial license lets you sell your creations for top dollar.

# Pricing & The Value Equation

Let’s talk numbers because this is where most people get stuck.

**Basic License: $49 One-Time**

* 4-second AI video clips
* 5-minute max video length
* Core features: text-to-video, image-to-video, inpainting, timeline editor, AI voices
* No watermarks
* Commercial rights
* Access to community groups and weekly training

**All-Access License: $179 One-Time (Use ""SECRET10"" for 10% OFF = $161.10)**

* Everything in Basic
* 8-second clips (double the length)
* 10-minute max videos
* Premium features: Talking/Singing Photos, AI Sound Effects, Consistent Characters, Object Removal, Face Swap, Background Editor, Subtitles App
* Faster rendering servers

**The Math That Matters:**

* Competitors charge $30-99/month for similar features
* Stock footage sites cost $50-200 per clip
* Freelancers charge $500-2,000 per minute of animation

At $49 one-time, **you break even after creating just ONE video.** Everything after that is pure profit.

# Pros & Cons (The Unfiltered Truth)

**Pros:**

1. **One-time pricing** – Never pay again
2. **All-in-one solution** – Eliminates 5-7 separate subscriptions
3. **No watermarks** – Professional output from day one
4. **Commercial license included** – Sell your work freely
5. **Cloud-based** – Works on any device, no installation
6. **800+ AI voices** – Largest collection I've seen in a single app
7. **Consistent characters** – Unique feature for storytelling
8. **30-day money-back guarantee** – Zero risk

**Cons:**

1. **Learning curve** – While easier than Premiere Pro, you still need to spend 2-3 hours mastering the interface
2. **4-8 second clips** – You'll need to stitch multiple clips for longer scenes (though the editor makes this easy)
3. **Rendering time** – Can take 1-3 minutes per clip during peak hours
4. **AI limitations** – Complex multi-character scenes sometimes need prompt refinement

# Real-World Applications I Tested

**1. Ecommerce Product Demo**  
Generated a 30-second ad for a fictional coffee brand using 6 AI clips merged in the timeline editor. Total time: 18 minutes. Result: Professional enough to run on Facebook Ads.

**2. Educational Content**  
Created a 5-minute ""History of Rome"" video using consistent character technology for the narrator. Added auto-generated subtitles in Spanish. Total time: 45 minutes.

**3. Social Media Reels**  
Produced 10 vertical videos (9:16) for Instagram using the same base prompt with variations. Repurposed them using the outpainting feature for YouTube Shorts. Total time: 30 minutes for all 10.

**4. Client Pitch**  
Used talking photos to animate a client's CEO photo for a personalized video message. Landed a $3,000 project because ""nobody else offered this level of personalization.""

# The Bottom Line: Should You Buy It?

Here's my direct answer:

**If you're currently paying for ANY of these tools—ChatGPT Plus, Midjourney, Runway, Pika,** [**Captions.ai**](http://Captions.ai)**, or stock footage subscriptions—VideoExpress AI will save you money within the first month.**

**If you're a content creator struggling with production speed, this is your force multiplier.** You can create 10x more content in half the time.

**If you're a business owner tired of agency fees, this pays for itself with your first video.**

The one-time pricing model is the clincher. In an industry obsessed with monthly recurring revenue, VideoExpress AI is flipping the script. But deals like this don't last—the founder has already hinted at moving to a subscription model once the launch period ends.

**The 30-day money-back guarantee makes this a no-brainer.** You can literally generate 100 videos, test every feature, and get a full refund if it's not for you. There's zero risk and unlimited upside.

# Final Verdict

**VideoExpress AI Review** score: **9.2/10**

This isn't just another AI toy. It's a legitimate business tool that delivers professional-grade results without the professional-grade price tag. The combination of generation, editing, and commercial rights in one platform is unmatched at this price point.

My advice? **Get the All-Access license.** The premium features—especially talking photos, consistent characters, and the subtitles app—are worth the extra $130. Use coupon **""SECRET10""** to knock it down to $161.10.

Once you create your first talking photo video or consistent character story, you'll understand why this is a game-changer.

[**Secure Your VideoExpress AI Access Now → One-Time Payment, No Monthly Fees, 30-Day Guarantee**](https://imsuccessconnection.com/VideoExpressAI)

**P.S.** The coupon ""SECRET10"" won't last forever. If you're even slightly curious, lock in the discount now. You can always refund later, but you'll never get this pricing again once it goes monthly.",1,1763009010.0,IMSuccessConnection,0,1.0,False
1ovs1s5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovs1s5,"17 Again! Delete My Trauma, Unsubscribe the Guy Made Me Jump... to My Death!","In my last life, Vaughn Castellano's first love died because of me.


He was completely destroyed.


So he married me—not out of love, but revenge.


He took my everything. My business. My family. My future.


He broke me down until I couldn't take it anymore.


Until I jumped.


Right before I died, Vaughn stood there, cold as ice, and covered my eyes with his hand.


""Josie, if there's a next life... stay away from me and Piper. Just stay away.""


When I opened my eyes, I was seventeen again.


Same path to Lincoln High I'd walked a thousand times.


Down the street, Vaughn and Piper were heading my way.


Piper spotted me first and waved like crazy.


""Josie! Over here!""


I froze.


This time? Of course I'm staying the HELL away from both of them.


So I grabbed my backpack, hurled it straight at them, and RAN.


---


""Josie! Hey! What's going on? We're gonna be late!""


I didn't stop. Just kept running against the crowd of students in their uniforms.


The wind hit my face, warm and real.


God, it felt good.


Being alive felt so damn good.


All that darkness from before—the kind that gets inside me and won't let go, the kind that makes me want to die—it was gone.


Right now, I was just seventeen-year-old Josie Hartwell.


Healthy. Happy. Alive.


The Hartwells and Castellanos went way back. Vaughn was a year older than me, and he'd always looked out for me growing up.


Candy when we were kids.


Pretty dresses when we got older.


A sapphire necklace for my sixteenth birthday…


He'd been good to me for as long as I could remember.


Plenty of girls wanted him, but I was the one by his side.


He was like a brother. But somewhere along the way, he also became the guy I secretly loved.


Until freshman year happened—


I passed out during the sports meet, and Piper Ashford took me to the nurse.


After that, there were three of us instead of two.


Vaughn and Piper had everything in common—same interests, both straight-A students, always talking about something I couldn't keep up with.


I slowly became the third wheel tagging along.


...


In my last life, the rumors that Piper's stepdad raped her spread through the whole school.


Before she jumped, her hair was a mess and she stared at me with pure hate.


""Josie Hartwell, remember this—YOU killed me!""


Then she jumped. Didn't hesitate. Didn't give anyone time to stop her.


Didn't even give me a chance to explain.


When Vaughn saw the note she left, he lost it.


His fingers dug into my shoulders so hard I thought my bones would break. His eyes were bloodshot, filled with this hatred that scared the hell out of me.


""Josie! Why? Why would you do this?""


""You're the only one who knew!""


""I..."" My throat felt like sandpaper. I could barely get the words out through the pain.


""It wasn't me.""


""I didn't do it.""


But nobody believed me.


Piper accused me in front of everyone before she died.


That was it. I was guilty.


Any defense I tried just sounded pathetic next to a dead girl's final words.


So I got bullied. Isolated.


Everyone looked at me like I was a murderer. Every single person at school had it out for me.


Especially Vaughn.


Four years later, the Castellanos wanted to merge with my family. Vaughn agreed to marry me.


It was like Piper never existed. He went back to treating me the way he used to—sweet, caring, perfect.


I thought maybe Vaughn finally believed me.


He ruffled my hair the way he'd done since we were kids, his face soft and warm.


""Josie, let's get married.""


I remembered Vaughn being like this—gentle, protective. I thought the old Vaughn was back.


Until he got his hands on the Ashford family's private files.


Until he destroyed my family's business piece by piece.


Until my parents got kicked out of Seattle and I was trapped in that house.


Hatred. Silent treatment. That's all I got, every single day.


Vaughn stopped pretending. When he looked at me, his eyes were empty and cold.


""Josie, everything Piper went through? You're gonna go through it too.""


""Why don't you just die? Maybe then... maybe I could finally forgive you.""


So seven years later, I did exactly what Vaughn wanted. I jumped, just like Piper did.


...


I stood there on the sidewalk, the school bell still ringing in my ears.


The feeling of my skull cracking open, my soul being ripped out, Vaughn's cold voice in those final seconds—all of it slowly faded from my mind.


""Josie, if there's a next time... stay the hell away from us.""


I let out a long breath.


This time, I'm staying far away from Vaughn Castellano and Piper Ashford. Both of them.


Then I turned and ran home as fast as I could.


Chapter 2


""Josie? Shouldn't you be in class right now?""


The second I burst through the door, Mom was in the backyard with her coffee, looking totally relaxed. She seemed surprised to see me.


My eyes got hot and I threw myself at her, holding on tight.


In my last life, they lost everything. Vaughn—the kid they'd watched grow up—forced them out of Seattle. I didn't even get to say goodbye before I died.


""You're still so clingy. What are you gonna do when you get married someday?""


Mom's voice was gentle and teasing above my head.


But the word ""married"" made me flinch.


I held her tighter.


""I'm not getting married. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here with you and Dad, helping with the company, being a spoiled rich kid who does absolutely nothing...""


Mom pretended to be annoyed, but she was smiling.


""Well then, I guess we'll just have to let you mooch off us forever.""


...


I spent the whole evening pulling myself together.


The next day, I went back to school. The driver dropped me off at the gates.


As I got out, I caught a glimpse of Vaughn and Piper at the corner, laughing about something.


That was our usual spot. They were waiting for me.


Terrified they'd see me, I ducked my head, grabbed my backpack, and rushed into school.


That path. The three of us walking together. I'd always watch Vaughn, but Vaughn only ever watched Piper.


This crush should've ended a long time ago.


But back then, young and stupid, I was just happy to steal one more look at Vaughn on that stupid path.


After school, I dragged my feet leaving. Vaughn and Piper were still waiting at the gate.


No way around them. I had to walk out.


Piper didn't ask why I ran yesterday. She just linked her arm through mine like always, warm and familiar.


""Josie! We waited like forever. What happened?""


I tried to hold it together, but I couldn't help it—I pulled my hand away.


Piper's face froze for a second before she recovered.


""It's my birthday today. You're coming, right?""


My heart dropped.


In my last life, Piper's birthday was when she got drunk and we talked about everything. That's when she told me about her stepdad—that he raped her when she was younger.


How could I risk hearing her secrets again?


I didn't dare look at Vaughn standing next to her. Just kept my head down, stumbling over my words.


""I... I can't. Family stuff. Happy birthday though.""


With that, I turned and walked away fast, ignoring Piper's eyes turning red behind me.


Suddenly I heard footsteps behind me.


""Josie.""


Vaughn.


My heart jumped. I kept my head down and walked faster.


Vaughn caught up in like three steps and blocked my path. His shadow fell over me completely.


""Why are you running?""


Finally, I looked up at eighteen-year-old Vaughn.


He wore the familiar uniform. His face was sharp and handsome. But his eyes had this depth, this coldness that didn't match his age—exactly like the Vaughn from my last life.


Wait.


Eighteen-year-old Vaughn would never look at me like this.


Panic hit me hard. I stumbled backward, almost losing my balance.


Vaughn stepped closer, literally standing on my shadow.


""Josie, you're scared of me, aren't you?""


Chapter 3


The next second, Vaughn's face softened. He reached out and ruffled my hair like he used to.


""Josie, are you okay? Why are you avoiding me and Piper?""


""It's Piper's birthday. She'll be really upset if you don't come. Let's go celebrate together, yeah?""


Vaughn was smiling, but I could feel him testing me.


Made sense.


Since yesterday, I'd been acting completely different, avoiding them whenever I could, not hanging on Vaughn's every word like I used to in my last life.


If Vaughn wasn't actually eighteen-year-old Vaughn, he'd definitely suspect I wasn't seventeen-year-old Josie either.


After three years of marriage, whatever I'd felt for Vaughn died along with everything else he put me through.


Now? I hate him. And I'm scared as hell of him.


""I... I...""


I forced a smile, but Vaughn had already turned to the driver waiting by the curb. ""Hey Marcus, friend's birthday. I'll drop Josie off later.""


Marcus knew our families were close. He nodded and drove off.


I had no choice but to follow them.


Back when the three of us used to hang out, I'd mostly just watch Vaughn and Piper talk and laugh with perfect chemistry while my heart twisted with jealousy.


But now? I just watched them blankly, feeling nothing.


Actually, I was trying to figure out what excuse I could use to leave early.


...


The night before I jumped in my last life was the anniversary of Piper's death.


Vaughn, who usually stayed out partying, came home for once. He smiled at me—that gentle smile—while he destroyed me.


""Josie, remember senior year? When those kids cornered you in that alley? I was there that day. I stood at the entrance... and I watched.""


The window reflected my face going white.


That day. I'll never forget that day.


Several students trapped me in the alley behind Lincoln High. They called me a murderer. They took turns slapping me. They ripped up all my books and threw the pieces everywhere.


Then they made me post a video on Instagram saying ""I'm sorry, Piper"" over and over while they filmed.


I did what they wanted because that was the only way to make it stop.


On graduation day, I thought it was finally over. I tried so hard to forget those awful memories, to bury everything about Piper.


I thought I could start over.


But seven years later, Vaughn told me that on that day—that horrible, humiliating day—he was there. He'd been there the whole time.


Vaughn, who'd held my hand since we were kids, who'd been like a brother watching me grow up—he stood there and watched me get beaten, cursed at, humiliated.


And he did nothing.


Vaughn leaned down and whispered in my ear.


""Oh, and Josie. Your mom's sick—can't even afford her medication. And your dad? He's out there working construction. At his age. Threw out his back last month.""


""That's all you, Josie. They could've been comfortable forever. But now they're paying for what you did.""


I watched my own eyes go dead in that window with every word he said.


Turns out, as long as I was alive, as long as Vaughn was in my life, nothing could ever end.


I could only escape through death.


On the way to the party, Vaughn called the manager at his family's club and had them clear out a private room.


Listening to his voice—calm, in control, like he owned the place—I suddenly thought of Vaughn after we got married.


This was how he sounded after taking over the family business.


Had he been reborn too?


The thought made me nervous.


No matter what, I couldn't let Vaughn figure out I was different.


If Vaughn really had been reborn, and if everything from my last life happened again, I'd still be the one who hurt Piper in his eyes.


After all, I was the ONLY one who knew Piper's secret.


In the private room, Piper picked a love song and asked Vaughn to sing it with her, all shy and cute.


Everyone immediately started teasing them.


In their eyes, Vaughn and Piper were basically together already—they just hadn't made it official yet.


I watched it all. Just felt the whole birthday thing was boring and endless.


Suddenly the door opened. A woman in an expensive suit walked in.

1ovrtfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ovrtfq/should_i_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_or_not/,Should i break up with my boyfriend or not?,"For context, me and my boyfriend come from a community where guy and girl friendships are not necessarily condemned but also not praised. Me and him have been dating for 9.5 months, and for the past month we’ve been having complications about this particular issue and we cant seem to get past it so im writing this in hopes that someone understands our problem and gives genuine good advise. 

Both me and my boyfriend, lets call him Ben, have plans to get married, and are close like that. The issue is, Ben also seems to have a lot of female friends because he lives on campus and hangs out with his guy friends who happen to have these girls around them. This one girl in particular, lets call her Bri has recently become close to my boyfriend ever since she ran into him at the gym and asked for his number so they could hang out (he knows her from before but they lost touch when they got to campus so it was like reconnecting). 

I am not trying to throw shade but this girl only hangs out with guys, and i have mer her, and only seen her be around guys till 4-5am. She, also like my boyfriend, lives on campus and alone. 
Recently, she’s been hanging out with my boyfriend alot alone in person, till 1-2am at night. Im not a fan of that, and i have brought this issue to my boyfriend but he keeps saying they’re friends and if he’s not hitting on her or she’s not hitting on him, he doesn’t see the issue. He keeps saying he wouldn’t mind if i had guy friends like that but in all honesty, i dont and i dont hangout with them till 1-2am. 

For more context, my boyfriend is one of the few people with a car and so he picks her up, she sits in the front seat and he drops her back home at 1-2am “because she lives close.” I dont know how i feel about that. 

The reason why i am writing this post is particularly about what happened today where my boyfriend had an exam for his math class and had to study. We had a big fight earlier this morning but we sorted it out. I fell asleep and so this is all what he told me and im relaying. 
According to him, he couldn’t study at his place and so he went to the library, where he met Bri and two more friends (a guy and another girl) and they all did their assignments. After that, they decided to roam on campus and he also decided then that he’s going to skip the exam because he only needs two out of the three and he has already done the other two. After this, the other two friends left as it got cold and dark and my boyfriend and Bri came to an on campus gym facility where he said he worked out. After this, instead of going home and cooking food, finishing assignments and getting his chores done like he had originally planned and told me about, my boyfriend and Bri went to this coffee place that i really want to go to but we have not gotten the chance and this week he’s gone twice with Bri already. Thats when i woke up, and texted him. He then told me he’s still there because she’s still finishing up assignments, and he’s waiting so she can get done, he can drop her off and go home to resume all the mentioned chores. Now i didn’t say anything this time because our fight in the morning was also about this same girl and im trying to be more broad minded. For context, its 11:18pm right now and they’re still on their way back. 

So the people reading this, am i overreacting about this girl and his vague response of “they’re only friends”, or should i breakup because he’s clearly not respecting a boundary that i have stated since day 1 and its been causing too many fights that lead to nothing because he doesn’t get my point??

Also another thing, Bri is 1-2 years older than us in age but she’s still in the same year as us, and my boyfriend is the only one in this age group that she hangs out with- all other guys are her age. 

Edit: I don’t think i mentioned it before but Ben’s dad and my dad are close friends now because of business related reasons. My mom also adores Ben and his mom knows about me and speaks highly of me every time they’re on call. So if we were to break up, i don’t know how i would deal with all that.

As a society, we tend to not speak about death but coming face to face with our own mortality as somber as that may seem has its benefits. 

To give you all the back story, I was recently after many many many years (think 30 years) of constantly fighting illness at the ripe old age of 37 I was diagnosed with vascular elhers Danlos, there isn’t anyone I can find documented that has managed to somehow flex the system and live much more than 45-50 (and they were super healthy) I unfortunately have made some very poor choices and happen to be a functional stimulant addict ((seems pointless to stop now) started it to try help me have energy to function trying to keep up with every day norms like work/house keeping so on and so forth) so I am now faced with the exceptional reality that given the advanced symptoms I am experiencing and the functional frontal left lobe microvascular bleeding I keep having that I have probably brought an even earlier ticket into my comfy warm position in the afterlife due to my choices, this is vastly backed by the horrendous and quickly deteriorating quality of life I am currently exhibiting. So I am left with the unique ability to circumnavigate the way my funeral will play out. I basically spent my life savings on pointless tests and scans, only to find out the end is near and there is not anything I can do at this late stage to prevent or prolong it.

So with that in mind, and with the knowledge that I am not looking for how freezedried mango powder and dehydrated ants nests and hot yoga cured your great grandmothers ingrown toe nail but I am interested in hearing how other people would plan there final goodbye.

My music choices (and no it’s not to everyone’s taste) would be ;

Dizzyisdead - wish you worse (because im petty as fuck - I have already instructed my very best friend/ soul sister to boo anyone I hate out my funeral because I am not the bigger person, they can’t pacify there grief by attending the funeral of someone whose life they made hard while they were alive & coz I just hate fake people talking about how they will miss me and I was such a good person blablabla) 

Nick cave and the bad seeds - into my arms (I’ve always liked this song since I was a kid for some weird reason)

Kahux - stargazing (no reason for this just think the lyrics sit well with my life lessons) 

Arthur gunns (creadance Clearwater revival cover) - have you ever seen the rain / acoustic version

And with specific instructions that 
1. People I didn’t like in life don’t attend my afterlife party (or I will poltergeist them for ever) 
2. That it’s not sad
3. That I am not cremated or buried (I know that doesn’t leave many options I have suggested wood chipper and everyone brings a piece of white clothing to lay down and take a piece of me home but was told that was absolutely morbid and not a possibility) im hoping that they can turn me into garden mulch or do a water obliviation failing both those options being not available I will suffice for cremation at very last choice but I want to be mixed in with my pets ashes and scattered not kept on someone’s shelf in there house watching them and there significant others fight about whose turn it is to choose a Netflix doc.
4. That my best friends meet up once a month for a coffee or a lunch and don’t isolate themselfs from one another. Come together and laugh and be friends -(one of my best friends has no other friends besides me so im trying to make sure he stays safe after I vanish) 
5. Don’t get up and lie at my funeral, I was not a great person, I was a bitch, I was out spoken and opinionated but 100 authentically myself irregardless of who I was in front of.
6. Don’t wear black, lame. 
7. Don’t show any photos of me after I got ugly and sick or I’ll haunt you.
8. Do not let the funeral home do my make up ugly and make sure my toes and fingers look nice I don’t want to go into the afterlife looking like a cheap street walker. 
9. Dress me in something comfy, god forbid I have to enter the next realm in a dress and high heels and be complaining for eternity that my feet hurt. 
10. Make sure my pets get a chance to say good bye to me, they have been my MVPs for the last 6 years and turned up even when no one else did, no matter how ugly and fat and moody I got they never judged me or disbelieved me about being sick. 

That’s all. I guess in some regards I’m lucky to have the ability to hyper control a gathering even in death because I am a control freak, but more so because more often than not we don’t have these types of conversations with our special people when everyone’s alive, and sometimes I have attended funerals of people and instantly realised that they didn’t know anything about the person they are laying to rest. 

Love each other and spend each day like it’s your last because most people when asked there biggest regrets right before dying don’t say “I wish I had been skinner” or “ I wish I made more money” they regret not taking certain opportunity’s in life to extend there time here with there people, the people they love and cherish and they regret not taking chances on things because they were scared. My biggest regret thou is that I didn’t tell certain people to fuck off, sooner than I should have, and that I grew up way to fast and was always so fucking responsible and serious. 

Stress kills, leave that shitty job, tell that POS bf to go kick rocks. Nothing is worse your health in the long run. Some of the happiest people on earth are unemployed, single, cat hoarders who laugh ever day unmedicated at the most trivial of things.
