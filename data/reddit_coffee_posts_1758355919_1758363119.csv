1nlua4w,https://i.redd.it/fp7k5uq3naqf1.png,"Just came back from South Korea: I loved it, and we need to protect it","Hello everyone. I just came back from a 3 week trip to South Korea. I went with my girlfriend, we're both passionate about travelling, hiking, nature, and experiencing different cultures. We've been to Seoul, Sokcho, Gyeongju and Seogwipo. We hiked Hallasan and Seoraksan, we explored temples and ultramodern districts, we stayed out of the tourist traps and tried our lack with basic korean in local restaurants or cafes, never disappointing. 

South Korea has been a paradise for our way of travelling. Overall I found it to be a welcoming country with pride for their history and overcomings. There is tourism, but it doesn't feel excessive. There are globalization and cultural homogenization with dominant cultures, but not excessively, and it retains a korean touch. People speak English, but did not entirely gave in to it, to favor tourism. 

I live in Barcelona and I am from near Venice, and these are our everyday problems. I think that South Korea should really try and keep the boat going in this direction, trying not to become an overtourism hell, remaining accessible but requiring some homework to visit. Tourism money is tempting, but in excess it brings more problems than it does good. The potential in South Korea is huge, as it is a beautiful country. But it could ruin itself if it went for it all the way with tourism. 

Overtourism is ruining one place after the other, as masses of people arrive in excessive numbers and eventually tear the place down by its very fiber, which can't sustain those numbers. Everyone has the right to travel, the problem is in the volume of people. I hope South Korea won't convert all its housing into short term stay, and won't lose its beautiful culture in favor of cheap international stuff you can find everywhere. 

What do you think? Did you have the same impression? Do you have the same fears? 

TLDR; I loved South Korea more than any other place I've visited, and I am afraid it will give in to greed with tourist money, becoming yet another place ruined by overtourism. ",2,1758362709.0,koreatravel,0,0.75,False

sit at the center of the busted table, maps spread like a scratched-up heart. The lamp throws one thin circle of light; the rest is rumor and shadow. Around me are Zenos with that tired calm, Samuel like a coiled wire, Sofia busying her hands with the spiders on her wrist, Giulia knuckling her fists until her nails whiten. The city’s noise is a distant pulse. Here, in this room, the pulse is our decision.

“We need discipline,” I say. No sermon, no promise, just the hard fact. “Not just fury. Training. The Association didn’t fall because people wanted it to; it collapsed when someone rewrote the rules. We will rewrite the rules.”

I point to the paper, routes, rendezvous, who covers what. My voice narrows with each line. The plan is simple and ugly. Small teams, clear signals, drills until muscle remembers before mind does.

“Intensive training. Small cells for sabotage, infiltration, extraction, and communications. No one gets in without discipline. If you sign up, you train until your body refuses. Then you train more. We are not a mob. We are an army.”

Zenos folds his hands. His mouth is a thin line. “What about the innocents? The kids, the people who still think this can be fixed without war? We can’t drag everyone into a fight they didn’t choose.”

His words land like cold water. I nod. “We won’t. We protect the ones who can’t fight. We only take those who know what it means to stand in the line. Families get paths out. We are not raising slaughterhouses.”

Samuel leans forward, eyes hard. “Numbers matter. If we can’t match them blow for blow, we drown them in people who can hold ground.”

I let that sit before I answer. “We can’t herd people like cattle. Propaganda will eat us alive if we do. The city will cheer a butcher if we hand them a script. We win hearts, or we lose everything.”

Then comes the sharp tooth. Information. Without the Association’s files, movements, identities, schedules, we are blind fighters. We need someone who can open doors, pull records, point at the faces that matter.

“Telepathy,” Zenos says, voice low, like he’s naming a curse. “Almair cut them down. He buried a generation. Luke is gone. Only Bento survives. If we had a telepath, if Bento could be reached, we could pull innocents out before the fight even starts.”

Luke’s name hangs in the room like a folded flag. I feel the shape of that loss, strategic and personal. Zenos continues. “Marcus is the other option. Not a telepath, but he has access to every registry, every dispatch log. If Marcus turns, we can clear civilians and expose who the real players are.”

Samuel scoffs. “Marcus is a coward. He won’t do it.”

“Then we persuade him,” Zenos says, calm and certain. “Or we make the choice for him.”

The room tightens. Coercion smells dangerously like the thing we fight. Still, I nod. “We try persuasion first. But if the only way to save hundreds is to break one man’s lock, then we break it. Minimal pain. No theater.”

Sofia touches my arm, her eyes bright. “The crowd last night came hungry for meaning. They left with hope. If we give them direction, they’ll follow.”

Hope is dangerous, but it is heavy and effective. I stand, the wood creaking under me. “So we do both. We build soldiers and safety nets. Marcus is the key. We pressure if we must. If Bento can be brought in, even better. Tonight will be unforgettable. Not for the blood we spill, but for the lives we save.”

They nod. Iron settles into their spines. The plan is alive now: training, protection, Marcus as the linchpin, Bento as a possible shield. If it fails, the cost is everything. If it works, we carve open a future.

“Then let’s begin,” I say.

And we do.

**Leo**

I woke with Pietro’s words still burning in my head. He had stepped out of his portal last night, the air still humming with its strange silence, his eyes brighter than I’d ever seen. He had been almost trembling, like a man who had finally found a piece of truth.

“Gabe isn’t asking for war,” he told me. “Not the kind the Association wages. He’s asking for freedom. For choice. He wants his people to live their lives without chains, without fear. No empire, no conquest. Just peace. That’s why they bleed, Leo. Not to rule. To be left alone.”

I had listened, and something in me had shifted. Pietro’s voice wasn’t just conviction—it was relief. Like he had finally found something worth believing in. And I wanted that too.

Now, morning light spilled through the window, pale and soft, and I could still hear his voice. The smell of cheap coffee and iron pans drifted in from the kitchen. James and Antônio were already there, talking. I pulled on my jacket, bracing myself, and joined them.

Antônio looked up at me. His face was tired, but steady.

“Are you going to the meeting tonight?” I asked him. My voice came out sharper than I meant. “And if you are… will you be able to keep from starting a war in the middle of it?”

He exhaled slowly, rubbing his jaw. “Yes. Even if I wanted Gabe dead, I couldn’t take him surrounded by his people. It would be suicide. Better to see what they’re planning, and pass something solid to Bartolomeu.”

The name hit me like ash in my mouth, but before I could answer, James spoke up, his voice carrying that smug weight.

“I’ll go too,” he said, eyes narrowing. “Not as myself. I’ll take a dog’s shape. Nobody will notice, but I’ll be there.”

Antônio shot him a look sharp enough to cut glass. “No. You don’t move a finger. We’re already outnumbered. We’ll slip into the crowd, listen, and nothing more. You make a wrong move, and we’re corpses before the night’s done.”

James smirked but said nothing. His silence told me more than words.

I sat there, nodding along, but my mind was miles away. Pietro’s voice echoed again: We can make him see, Leo. We can convince Antônio that the truer cause lies with Gabe. That forgiveness is stronger than vengeance.

I wanted to believe it. I wanted to believe Antonio could be turned. He hated Gabe with a fire that burned every word he spoke, but maybe, maybe, he could learn to put it down. Maybe I could help him see what Pietro already saw.

But then there was James. Lurking. Poison in the room. I knew what he wanted. To slither his reports back to Bartolomeu. To Almair. To turn tonight into a trap before the truth could even breathe.

I clenched my hands beneath the table. I didn’t know how yet, but I knew one thing with absolute certainty: I had to silence him.

Not with words. Not with reason. With finality.

My heart beat faster. Because if Gabe was there, if Zenos was there, I couldn’t hide forever. They would see me. And I didn’t know if they would welcome me or cast me out.

Still, Pietro’s conviction rang in me. He had chosen his path. And so had I.

I just needed the courage to walk it.

-----

**Pietro**

The afternoon dragged heavy, the kind that pressed heat into your skin and made the alleys feel smaller than they already were. Amelie and I sat in the back corner of Coquinho’s, the smell of grease and stale bread clinging to the air. She stirred her drink without drinking it, eyes sharp with that same restless doubt she carried everywhere.

“It’s time we admit this mission failed,” she said finally. Her tone wasn’t cold—it was sharper than that, like glass ready to cut. “We can’t break through what I saw last night. They’re united. Gabe and Zenos aren’t going to be hiding in some quiet corner waiting for us. They’ll be in the middle, surrounded, untouchable. We should step back before Antonio drags us all down.”

I let her words hang between us, heavy, but I didn’t bite. I’d heard her doubts before. I knew they weren’t cowardice, but calculation. Still, something inside me bristled.

“Calm down,” I said, keeping my voice low, steady. “Antonio isn’t stupid. He’s not reckless. He’s a man who measures before he cuts. He’ll see for himself tonight. That’s why he agreed to go—to judge whether the mission can even be done. He wants to know if there’s a real chance to take Gabe’s head, or Zenos’s.”

Her eyes flicked to mine, testing. Then she leaned back and nodded slowly. “I trust Antonio. Out of all of us, he’s the only one who still seems sane.”

I only nodded in return. No point in pushing her further. But inside, my thoughts churned.

Antonio was no fool, that much was true. But I hoped—no, I prayed—that what he saw tonight would be more than just targets to weigh. That he would see what I saw in Gabe’s words, in Zenos’s presence, in the fire of the people’s hope. There was still goodness in him, buried beneath the anger, the vengeance. I had seen it.

If Antonio could let go of that hunger for revenge, even just for a moment, he could be more than a soldier. He could be part of something greater.

And I trusted him enough to believe he might be that man.

**Antônio**

The street smells like smoke and old blood. Pietro paces ahead, restless. Leo walks close, quieter than usual. Amélie keeps her jaw tight. James’s dog-guise pads along, tail low. I walk with them and feel the math of choices in my teeth: what I want, what I must do, what will keep the people I care about alive.

A single thought keeps returning, sharp and stupid and impossible: kill Gabe here, now, quick and clean. The image flashes—Gabe folding, the crowd turning, chaos erupting like a lung collapsing. Would the square become a slaughter? Would Pietro, Leo, Amélie be crushed under the first stampede? Would the Association use the noise to drive a wedge so deep no one could climb out?

I do not want my friends dead. I do not want them crushed as a byproduct of my vengeance. That alone forces me to slow the fantasy, to treat it like a weapon I might use someday but must test first.

So I run the alternatives cold, like counting bullets.

Option one: Strike now. Sudden assassination in the crowd. Pros: immediate removal of a leader I blame for too many deaths. Cons: a riot, endless bodies, exposure—Almair would love it. The Association would call it proof that the Red Zone is irredeemable. They would steamroll us under public outrage. My people would die in the name of my anger.

Option two: Pretend to join. Get close, win trust, learn the structure. Then, when the Association is weakened or exposed, move. Pros: remove the real power the machine behind the man first. Cons: patience is a dangerous mask. One slip and I become traitor and corpse.

Logic pushes me toward the second path. Vengeance is a clean thing on the tongue but a rotten plan in the world. If the goal is to break the wheel, you break its axle before you topple the visible statue on top. Almair is not just a man; he is a system. If I cut only hands now, the puppet’s voice remains. If I cut the spine later, the head falls easier.

We reach the meeting place. The plaza is dense, heat of bodies and hope and desperation overpowering the smell of smoke. Gabe walks the center like a preacher; he hands out groups, names leaders. Pietro drifts into one cell. Amélie is swallowed by another. Leo hesitates, then moves my chest tightens at that small, traitorous motion: will he run into open arms and leave me alone?

I take Zenos’s group seat. He talks steady, deliberate. When he speaks, the crowd leans in because his voice carries the weight of someone who knows what ruin tastes like. He lays out the plan with a clarity that rests my mind.

“We will break the Association,” he says. “We will make the Zone independent. Each cell trains, each group takes a task. It will be costly. There will be sacrifice. But the goal is the end of their rule.”

Zenos is not a blind preacher. He says, “I was a golden cape once. I defended the city. I learned what their system does. I traded that badge for the rest of my life because I could not live with the truth I uncovered. If I must give my life now to clean the debt, I will.”

His last line lands with the force of someone who has paid his dues. I see the edges of truth in it. Not the sentimental truth I hate, but a blunt, useful one: undermine the system that created Almair and the capes, and the men who thrived atop it become vulnerable.

Sitting in that circle, I weigh things again. Killing Gabe first is desire masked as strategy. Taking the Association apart first is strategy disguised as patience. If my aim is to break the wheel for real then taking down Almair’s reach must come before the revenge that would burn everything.

I am not abandoning my hate. I am rearranging it into a tool.

I will not change the aim. I will change the order.

If we remove the Association its propaganda, its bureaucratic teeth, its network of men like Bartolomeu then cutting Gabe down later becomes surgical instead of suicidal. It gives me a chance to keep Pietro and Leo alive. It gives me a chance to keep my hands clean of needless corpses.

This is not mercy. It is calculation. It is the only kind of justice I trust.

Zenos finishes and the room hums with plans and promises. People volunteer for tasks. Hope flares in faces like matches struck at damp wood. I listen, cold but attentive, because coldness keeps the possibility of survival alive. Some things are worth waiting for. Some blows must be struck in the right order.

I leave the meeting with the decision settled: dismantle the machine first, then take the man. Not because I forgive anything, but because I refuse to bury my friends under the rubble of my rage.",1,1758362425.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

So I tried one measurable line: **be home for dinner at six, most nights.**

I ran small tests first: phone sleeps in the kitchen, email off after 7 p.m., one weekend shift in an apron to see if a simpler rhythm could work. Ninety days later, these **four lessons** stuck:

* **Value > flash.** I asked three questions before choices: Does it make me healthier? Closer to my people? Closer to the life I want?
* **Shrink bills to breathe.** Cut unused subs, right-size housing, start a “Quiet Fund” (3–6 months of basics).
* **Soft transition.** Don’t burn bridges; test part-time, track sleep/dinners/mood, adjust weekly.
* **Visible boundaries.** Work at work; home at home. “Just ten more minutes” became a hard no.

Results weren’t dramatic, just real: better sleep, five dinners at home most weeks, money that fits the life instead of owning it.

1nltynm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1nltynm/first_ever_cruise_at_31_yo/,First ever cruise at 31 y.o.,"Hi! It has been almost a week since me and my husband disembarked from the Resilient Lady (Corfu, Dubrovnik & more itinerary). It was our first cruise ever, so we did not know what to expect and just came with open minds. This is not a detailed review, and I am posting this just because it might reassure some first time sailors like us who are financially conscious. 

We purchased the cheapest lock-it-in insider cabin directly on VV website. I contemplated choosing the sea terrace cabin instead or bidding on it later, but in the end I could not justify paying 600$ just for a balcony (and even then it would be for obstructed view). So we decided to apply our trusty “cheapest is best” approach, and stick with the inside cabin 😊

A couple of days before sailing we did not have our cabin assigned yet, and I had a feeling that we might have a free upgrade. When looking at the deck plans, there are not a lot of inside cabins anyway. And I was right - one day before sailing we got assigned a sea terrace cabin 8026Z (not obstructed). We were over the moon, to say the least. 

It was a perfect cabin, we did not hear any noise, even though we slept with balcony door open every night. Just once there was a karaoke somewhere close, but it ended pretty early and the noise was not bad. We really enjoyed our cabin, especially the hammock. That being said, after this sailing I am even more sure that we would have been perfectly happy in an inside cabin as well and for us it is not worth the extra money to have the balcony.  There are a lot of comfy spaces to hang out around the ship, and we used them quite a lot (our faves were loungers on deck 7 (or 6, I forgot) where you can always find shade; loungers with umbrellas on deck 16). Next time we will definitely go with inside lock it in again unless the price difference will be reasonable.

Before our voyage I was quite confused about extra spending on board. I saw multiple posts where people bought big amounts of bar tab, different add ons (such as splash of romance), shore things, grog walks, etc. It was almost as if one cannot fully enjoy a VV cruise without buying these extra things. Not that it was said so directly in those posts, but just the amount of discussions regarding extras were intimidating, as well as amounts of bar tab spent. I checked all these extras, and came to conclusion that reasonably we do not need any of them. The feeling that we will be missing out on something remained though. 

Well, now I can certainly say that it was the right call not to buy anything and we did not need it. Our total spending on board was 29 dollars (one lip balm in onboard shop; one mocktail in Extra Virgin which was not worth it and 10 dollars in casino just for fun 😀). We drink alcohol very rarely, so two or three drinks that we had on board for free during the whole week (e.g., sparkling wine during sail away party) was completely enough. 

A separate note regarding VV shore things - mostly, they are extremely overpriced, at least in Europe. Almost all ports here are very walkable and have beaches nearby. So we just did our own thing in all the stops - strolling the towns, admiring the views, swimming / chilling by the beach, getting iced coffee in cute coffee shops, etc., which is our fave thing to do in all our travels anyway. 

All in all, what I want to say is that we had the best experience on VV without splurging. The food is beyond amazing, the ship is immaculate, the onboard activities and entertainment are so diverse, there is no time to do it all. The people that we met and the overall vibe was great as well. I did not expect that we will enjoy cruising with VV so much. 

So if you are having doubts whether this is for you or you are feeling overwhelmed by all the different options that are offered and not sure how much money you will need to spend extra, there is 99% chance that you will enjoy a VV cruise regardless even if you just go with the cheapest option.

P.S. Just for context, we travel for leisure around 4-5 times per year, so we are very mindful how we allocate our travel budget. For example, not spending extra on VV will allow us to have another trip / see another country, etc. This is not to say that ours is the right approach (quite the opposite - we would not be able to cruise cheaply if other people did not spend more). This is just to reassure similar people to us that they will have a great cruise because I myself did not find the same reassurance here before 😊

1nltx9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1nltx9n/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs," I’m thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I’ve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I’ll write a few words about each so you understand why I’m asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it’s a horror story. I’m amazed they’re still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days — not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don’t randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.",1,1758361377.0,indiehackers,0,1.0,False

Two of the most popular treatments are **veneers** and **dental bonding**. Both can transform the look of your teeth, but the right choice depends on your dental needs, lifestyle, and budget. If you are searching for the best way to enhance your smile, visiting an experienced **dentist in Manikonda** can help you make an informed decision.

# Understanding Veneers | Dental Care in Manikonda

**Veneers** are thin, custom-made shells placed on the front surface of teeth. They are usually made of porcelain or composite materials and are designed to look natural while covering imperfections.

**Benefits of Veneers:**

* Long-lasting solution (10–15 years with proper care)
* Resistant to staining from coffee, tea, and food
* Provides a natural and polished appearance
* Ideal for fixing chipped, discolored, or uneven teeth

**Considerations:**

* Slight removal of enamel is required
* More expensive than bonding
* Irreversible procedure

For patients looking for a durable, natural-looking transformation, veneers are an excellent option offered at many **dental clinics in Manikonda**.

# Understanding Dental Bonding | Dental Clinic in Manikonda

**Dental bonding** involves applying a tooth-colored resin to the tooth surface and hardening it with a special light. It is a simpler, faster, and more affordable procedure compared to veneers.

**Benefits of Bonding:**

* Quick procedure, often completed in one visit
* Cost-effective cosmetic solution
* Requires little to no enamel removal
* Ideal for small chips, gaps, or discoloration

**Considerations:**

* Less durable than veneers (typically lasts 3–7 years)
* More prone to staining and chipping
* May require touch-ups over time

Bonding is a great choice for patients looking for a budget-friendly solution for minor imperfections at a **dental clinic in Manikonda**.

# Veneers vs. Bonding: Which Should You Choose? | Oral Care in Manikonda

Both veneers and bonding serve cosmetic purposes but differ in durability, cost, and maintenance. If you want a long-lasting, stain-resistant, and flawless smile, veneers may be the right option. However, if you need a quick and affordable fix for minor imperfections, bonding could be more suitable.

Consulting with a skilled **dentist in Manikonda** ensures you receive a personalized recommendation based on your oral health and goals.

# Conclusion

Improving your smile can boost your confidence and overall quality of life. Whether you choose veneers or bonding, the key is to seek professional **dental care in Manikonda** from a trusted and experienced specialist. At the right **dental clinic in Manikonda**, you will receive expert guidance and treatment tailored to your needs, ensuring the best results for your **oral care in Manikonda**.",1,1758361192.0,Smileworksdental,0,1.0,False

Have posted here before but for those who don’t know, my TF and I work together, we’re both married. As soon as I met him (in April 2024) there was insane chemistry even if it was just friendly at first - like he just understood me and I understood him. 

On June 13, I sent a vulnerable message laying bare everything I felt. He called me straight after and denied it all - framed our connection as “banter that went too far,” apologised, and said he was confused. It broke me. We spent the next few months in painful limbo: silence, distance, polite professionalism. He unfollowed me on Instagram. I kept holding the line, trying not to chase.

But something in him never fully left. Little signs kept surfacing - his ring stayed off, his energy softened whenever I was near, he lingered, he watched, and the eye contact we held/hold is still like nothing I’ve ever felt in my life. Even through the limbo. 

But finally last week, after a long period of distance, we finally reconnected. He accepted a coffee invite that I asked him for to “clear the air”. We spoke gently. I told him I missed how well we worked together. Through the week we’ve almost gone back to our normal pre-June 13 rhythm. He even called me on Friday just to share something that didn’t require a call. And there were sparks - so many sparks.

He still hasn’t said how he feels. But I feel it in everything: the way he looks at me, the way he avoids lying to me by going quiet, the way his nervous system visibly reacts around me. It’s our own language. And even though we’re not in union (yet) I feel lucky every day just to breathe the same air as him.

This journey is insane. But it’s ours.",1,1758361152.0,twinflames,1,1.0,False

09/09 The first time I was brought in and it was because of a severe allergic reaction to food like my whole body was flushed, itchy, and swelling. The swelling made it really hard for me to move for a couple of days. Doctor said the trigger was chicken and eggs. I had an allergy with seafoods and poultry when I was a kid. Thought I outgrew it as an adult but apparently not. My body was literally swelling for like a week but fortunately, the meds worked and I got better not until

19/09 Which was my father's birthday and I got hospitalized again and I wasn't able to commemorate and celebrate him on his special day. 🙏 Anyway, I woke up at around 6:30am from a severe stomach pain that radiates through my back. It was kind of going up to my throat and that's when I knew this might be an acid reflux. I took Gaviscon for hurtburn and Kremil-S but surprisingly, minutes and hours have passed and the pain was just getting worse. I don't know but that was really possible. 

At around 12nn, I couldn't take it anymore and I brought back in. They gave me a shot of Omeprazole and it didn't actually help for the first two hours. The pain was still there and I literally couldn't move. 

Until now, I'm still trying to identify the triggers. I've started gradually cutting off coffee  for like a month now? From 3-4 cups, I always make sure to just take my morning coffee and that's it. But after getting hospitalised again, I started having tea instead of coffee. Right now, I'm looking for alternatives and it's really difficult for me to adjust my eating habits but the trauma brought by two emergencies in a month makes me wanna just eat veggies for a while.

Idk guys, any tips on the food and eating habits especially now that I have very limited food choices due to allergy and hyperacidity.

1nltu42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Review/comments/1nltu42/the_genius_wave_review_miracle_brain_hack_or/,The Genius Wave Review: Miracle Brain Hack or Total Scam?,"# What is The Genius Wave?

**The Genius Wave** is an audio-based brainwave program (not a pill) that claims to boost your focus, memory, creativity and relaxation. It centers on a **7-minute “theta wave”** audio track developed by **Dr. James Rivers**, who is described as a neuroscientist affiliated with MIT. 

The idea is that listening daily guides your **brain into the deep-relaxation** ***theta state*** **(4–7 Hz)** where learning and creativity are at their peak. The program comes with an explanation booklet and other support materials, **so it’s sold as a complete package** (often at a steep discount) that you download and use at home.

https://preview.redd.it/hscngku0iaqf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d194c6442537add4440d460234f930cfec6a0e4

# How Does The Genius Wave Work?

The core technology is **brainwave entrainment**. In simple terms, the audio uses special sound patterns (binaural beats and isochronic tones) to nudge your brainwaves down into the theta range. Think of it like this: when the brain hears two slightly different tones in each ear, **it naturally “taps along”** and syncs its own waves to them. 

**The Genius Wave** track layers these beats in a precise way so that, over the **7 minutes**, your brain is guided into a relaxed but alert state. Company materials explain that listening puts you into a meditative, child-like state of mind where memory, intuition and problem-solving improve.

In practice, you simply wear stereo **headphones and play the 7‑minute audio each day**. No special equipment or **meditation skill is required**. The official site emphasizes the simplicity: “Just seven minutes daily with your headphones on, and you're giving your brain the equivalent of a power-up. 

Users are told they can do this during a **morning routine**, lunch break or evening wind-down. Over time, the goal is that the brain learns to more easily enter a high-performance theta state, helping your mind run at a higher capacity.

# What’s Inside The Genius Wave Program?

When you buy The Genius Wave program, you download a set of digital files. At minimum, this includes:

* **Core 7-minute audio track.** This is the theta-wave brain entrainment session.  
* **Quick-start guide or booklet.** A PDF or digital booklet explaining how and why to use the audio properly.  
* **Binaural beats and Isochronic tones.** The files contain these engineered sounds tuned to the theta range .  
* **Optional bonus tracks.** Some versions add extra audio for specific goals (e.g. creativity boost) .  
* **Educational materials.** Additional info on brainwave science and maximizing results.  
* **Lifetime updates and support.** The purchase normally includes any future improvements, plus access to customer support if needed .  

In short, it’s a **digital program** – no pills or hardware are required. You just play the provided audio on any device. As one overview notes, The Genius Wave **“combines a book and an audio track”** to guide you into theta brainwave states. The main content is the audio, but it’s packaged as a full program with guidance and bonuses.

# Benefits of The Genius Wave

The claimed benefits cover many aspects of mental performance. According to the program’s descriptions and user reports, regular use can:

* **Boost learning and memory.** Theta waves are linked to faster information absorption and recall. Listening to the track is said to help you learn new things more quickly and remember them better.  
* **Sharpen focus and concentration.** Many users report being able to concentrate longer on tasks. The website even lists “sharper focus during important tasks” as a key result.  
* **Increase creativity.** The theta state is naturally creative. Reviewers say it helps ideas flow and problem-solving ability jump. One review notes users feel “ideas flow naturally” and can “think outside the box” more easily.  
* **Reduce stress and anxiety.** The deep relaxation aspect of theta can calm the mind. Users often say they feel more relaxed or less anxious after sessions. The content lists “reduced stress” and “calmer mood” among its outcomes.  
* **Better sleep and emotional balance.** Some report falling asleep faster and feeling emotionally steadier. The product claims to “promote healthy sleep cycles” and overall well-being from the brainwave practice.  
* **Overall mental clarity.** In general, people say they “feel sharper” and clear-headed. For example, one user said they became “more concentrated and less prone to distractions” after using it .  

In summary, the program is marketed as a **holistic brain boost** – enhancing memory, creativity, mood, and reducing mental fog. 

Keep in mind these are reported or promised effects; **individual results can vary.** Still, the mix of relaxation and focused brain activity is at **least supported** by general neuroscience findings about binaural beats and theta waves.

# Who Should Use The Genius Wave?

The Genius Wave is pitched at a wide audience. It may be useful for anyone looking to improve their mental performance. For example, it’s often recommended for:

* **Students and academics.** People studying for exams or dealing with heavy information loads might use it to help focus and memory.  
* **Busy professionals.** Those with demanding jobs or complex projects may want sharper concentration and creativity at work.  
* **Aging adults.** Seniors who want to maintain cognitive health or slow age-related decline.  
* **Creative individuals.** Artists, writers, and makers who want to enhance their inspiration and out-of-the-box thinking.  
* **Health and self-improvement seekers.** Anyone interested in brain health, mindfulness, or alternative cognitive aids.  

One review explicitly says **The Genius Wave “is ideal for”** students, entrepreneurs, aging adults and creatives. In practice, the only real requirements are willingness to **listen for 7 minutes a day** and a device with headphones. There are no known medical restrictions. it might be worth a try.

# How to Use The Genius Wave?

Using The Genius Wave is very simple and takes just 7 minutes per day:

1. **Download and prepare.** After purchase, download the audio file(s) and guide. Open the quick-start guide to see tips.  
2. **Use headphones.** For binaural beats to work, use stereo headphones or earbuds.  
3. **Find a quiet spot.** Sit or lie down in a comfortable place where you won’t be disturbed.  
4. **Press play for 7 minutes.** Play the core audio track and simply listen. You don’t have to actively meditate; the sounds will do the work. The official instructions say it fits easily into routines (e.g. during morning coffee or lunch break).  
5. **Repeat daily.** Consistency is key. Many people notice a relaxing feeling right away, but deeper benefits generally build up over weeks of daily use.  

There are no complicated steps or exercises. **Just 7 minutes of dedicated listening** is the full “protocol”. You can use the program at any time of day, and some users even do multiple sessions (for example, morning and evening).

 But even one daily session is **enough to get started.** The creators recommend treating it like a daily brain routine.

# The Genius Wave Customer Reviews & Complaints

User feedback on **The Genius Wave is mixed**. Many customer comments are positive: people talk about better focus, sharper memory, and a calmer mind. For example, **one user wrote they became** “more concentrated and less prone to distractions” after regular use.

user say it took them weeks of **listening before noticing any change**, and still felt it was overpriced. A few have complained about the sales tactics (constant discount upsells) or had trouble getting refunds from unofficial sellers. 

# Is The Genius Wave Scam or Legit?

The Genius Wave **not  a scam .The company  it’s a legitimate program –** it even comes with a “60-day money-back guarantee . Promotional material strongly emphasizes that it is not a hoax and that many users have seen real benefits. **Its foundation is based on known neuroscience** (binaural beats affecting brainwaves), which adds some credibility.

However, many reviewers advise few caution.   A recent review sums it up well: the program is built on “plausible neuroscience”, **but buyers should “remain cautious.** beacuse While results can vary. In other words, it’s  not a  scam, but neither is it a  miracle.

If you do try it, **experts suggest treating** The Genius Wave as a potential supplement to good habits, not a magic bullet. Combine the audio sessions with regular sleep, **exercise and study** – and remember the return policy. That way, you take advantage of any upside while controlling your risk.

# Where to Buy The Genius Wave?

The Genius Wave is sold only through its official website. You will not find it on Amazon, in stores, or on third-party sites. **Anyone else claiming to sell it is likely a scammer or selling a fake product.** The official package is a downloadable program (audio + guides).

As of now, the price is about **$39 for lifetime access** (often advertised as a discounted rate from \~$200) . Some packages may bundle extra bonus content at higher prices, but the core program remains a one-time purchase. 

**Importantly, the sale comes with a money-back promise:** you can ask for a refund within the guarantee period (typically 90 days) if you’re not satisfied. Always make sure you are on the genuine site (check the URL carefully) before buying.

# Conclusion

If you feel overwhelmed, distracted, full of self-doubt, with zero idea of what to do or how to grow your community — this is for you.

I created my community 21 days ago. I had a skill (video editing + content creation) and I knew I wanted to build something with it and monetize it.

I saw Alex Hormozi's no-brainer offer and joined right away. Now I’ve got 90 days free — no pressure, plenty of time to start. Perfect!

The step that took me the longest? Going back and forth with ChatGPT and Claude, trying to perfect my offer. (Honestly, I wish I’d spent less time perfecting and just started my community earlier.)

Here’s what I learned in these weeks:

* You don’t need a perfect offer, a polished idea, or a full course to start.
* All you need are some ideas — then build as you go.

So here’s what I did:

I launched my community with no lessons, no courses. Just a short routine video about how I do things.

Why? 

Because I wanted to understand what people actually need and how I can deliver it. I talked to every single member who joined about their problems and how they wanted to solve them.

After a while, I saw patterns. Many of them shared the same struggles. So I filtered those issues and added them to my intake form (the questions new members answer before joining).

Now I can collect data, export it as a CSV, and run it through ChatGPT to analyze. And here’s the thing: DATA NEVER LIES. With it, I can create content and courses that solve real problems.

The main point of a community is to deliver what people need. When someone joins, it’s because they have an issue. Your job is to understand it and provide the solution.

Now, I let people shape the community while I give direction. Remember — [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) isn’t like social media, where you just post and people consume. Nope. It’s interactive, it’s alive.

\---------

Growth (the big question):

How did I grow to 57 members in 21 days?

https://preview.redd.it/p3yeagumd5qf1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a2bfac2caab094061c1441ee287a1074a3662f

I know some people get this number in a day or a week. But many struggle to add even 1 member — and I was in that boat too.

Here’s what worked for me:

* Mirror effect: Your members’ behavior reflects your behavior. If you’re not active in other communities, don’t expect people to be active in yours.
* Be a member first: Join communities you’re interested in. Act like a member, not just an owner. That’s how you’ll understand what drives engagement.
* Target wisely: If you’re not getting results, maybe you’re in the wrong communities. Go where your target audience already hangs out.
* Focus on [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) first: Members already here are semi-warm. Grow inside Skool before branching to other socials.
* Stay focused: Skool can be overwhelming with all the notifications. Pick 2–3 sources to learn from, make real connections, and network. Most people here are serious about business, so it’s easier to connect.

Also, learn how to adjust your notification settings to stay focused. I even made a short post on how to fix email notifications — check it out.

And finally: be authentic. Do things your way. Sure, steal like an artist — but add your flavor. Skool isn’t about showing off or posting Lambos. It’s about being real.

Sometimes I just share my morning coffee in the group — and people love it ☕🔥

PS: A lot can change in 21 days. Focus on your thing, stay consistent, and I’ll see you at the top 🚀

Notably, Bahrain now ranks above Qatar and Kuwait in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index (2025), and new digital licensing via Sijilat means you can set up most entities without ever leaving your desk.\
Key 2025 Developments\
\
100% Foreign Ownership: Extended to 99% of commercial activities (see full details), even outside free zones.\
Unified GCC Product Standards: Bahrain now accepts a single conformity assessment for most industrial goods—making cross-border shipments to KSA and UAE simpler.\
Faster Visas via LMRA: New eVisa rules allow GCC-wide visas for executives within 48 hours.\
\
Surprisingly, it’s often not the formal procedures but the informal majlis networking and coffee rituals that give you the insider edge—the willingness to listen, linger, and build trust. (If you’re ever invited to an EDB mixer in Seef, accept. That’s where partnerships are born.)\
Step 1: Choose the Right Bahrain Company Structure for GCC Growth\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, team shaping Bahrain companies for regional expansion. only to discover it limited my ability to open branches in Saudi Arabia. Lesson learned.\
Main Entity Types & Their GCC Implications\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability): Most flexible for regional operations; ideal for family offices, consultancies, and e-commerce.\
BSC (Closed): Best for raising capital and cross-border joint ventures; needed for listing and foreign branch setup.\
Branch Office: Direct Gulf market access, but you must link to a recognized foreign parent.\
Free Zone Company: Perfect for logistics, fintech, and trade. Bahrain’s free zones allow 100% foreign ownership and simplified customs (explore zones).\
\
Pro Tip: For most GCC plans, opt for a WLL or BSC. Check Keylink’s guide for tailored advice on entity types.\
Insider Tip\
Time your application for early morning, especially during mid-week (Tuesday/Wednesday). Avoid Ramadan peak hours; MOICT queues are half as long just after Asr prayer (my favorite hack for fast approval).\
Step 2: Register Efficiently—Saving Time and Money\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, Bahrain company registration workflow.. Have three names ready; Arabic and English.\
2. Draft MOA & AOA: Use a Keylink template; customize for GCC expansion clauses.\
3. Obtain Address Evidence: Shared offices in Seef save 30% vs. Bahrain Bay. Ask the landlord for a digital lease copy (recognized since mid-2024 changes).\
4. Apply for Commercial Registration (CR): Online or in-person at MOICT headquarters, Diplomatic Area (details). Submit scanned documents to avoid delays.\
5. Licenses & Approvals: MOICT for general, CBB for finance, NHRA for healthcare, EDB for tech incentives.\
6. Open Bank Account: Emirates NBD in Diplomatic Area has a dedicated fast-track for foreign companies (skip the queue if you arrive pre-10am—trust me).\
7. Register with LMRA: For workforce visas and labor cards. Use Tamkeen’s e-support during initial setup to avoid paperwork bottlenecks.\
Common Mistake\
Many skip the pre-approval for their business activity. Always check current “allowed activities” for foreigners (full list) to avoid rejection and re-application fees.\
Step 3: Understand Costs—Budgeting for Real Success\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation and GCC access., plus BHD 20–50 for name reservation.\
- Annual CR Renewal: BHD 100–350.\
- Office Rental: Shared desk in Seef: from BHD 80/month. Bahrain Bay premium address: BHD 350–600/month.\
- Legal/Agency Service Fees: BHD 400–1,000 for full handling, including MOA drafting.\
- Bank Account Opening: BHD 50–100 initial deposit (some banks now waive this for startups).\
See the full cost breakdown with live estimator.\
How to Save More\
\
Use virtual office addresses for non-essential staff.\
Group license applications (main + sub-activity) to save up to 20% in fees.\
Renew commercial registration online before the 15th day of the month—late penalty is BHD 50 per week.\
\
(Once, I missed a CR renewal by one day—the penalty almost matched my entire office rental for a month.)\
Step 4: Achieve GCC Market Integration—The Bahrain Advantage\
The real value? Bahrain offers regional passporting. Set up here, and you’re recognized in all GCC states via mutual recognition agreements (especially for manufacturing, IT, and consulting).\
How to Access the GCC from Your Bahrain-based Business\
\
GCC-wide Product Registration: Streamlined standards mean your goods/services are already approved for KSA, UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait.\
Branch Offices: Open a registered branch in KSA or UAE as a Bahraini entity—quicker than as a non-GCC company.\
VAT Registration: Bahrain’s low 5% VAT is recognized GCC-wide; collect, remit, and claim credits for cross-border sales.\
Banking: Use Bahraini banks for multi-GCC transactions. (Emirates NBD and Bank ABC excel at regional trade finance—they’ve saved my clients days in transfer times.)\
Free Zones: Operate warehousing, trading, and back-office support from Bahrain’s free zones (info here), then distribute across the Gulf.\
\
Unofficial Practice: Networking\
Don’t underestimate the value of the majlis. Many partnerships, especially for government contracts, begin with an informal coffee in an advisor’s office—sometimes right in the Diplomatic Area’s labyrinthine corridors. (And always bring business cards with bilingual text!)\
2025 Regulatory Change: Faster Setup, Stronger Oversight\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain company formation and GCC expansion.** for all new CRs. Now, you must submit a digital ID scan with facial verification—speeding up incorporation by 40%, but requiring higher-resolution passport copies.\
\
Practical Impact: No more in-person queueing at MOICT for document verification—my last client finalized their CR in under 48 hours. Double-check your document scans for clarity; resubmission adds delays.\
\
Post-formation compliance is easier, too. Online VAT filing and mandatory e-accounting mean you need robust systems from day one. I strongly recommend Keylink’s accounting support—they (literally) saved me from missing a VAT deadline last quarter.\
Step 5: Ongoing Support—Avoid Local Pitfalls, Tap Expert Help\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, Bahrain company formation advisory, customer service. can still open doors with agencies and banks.\
My Top Resource Recommendation\
If you’re short on time or new to the region, Keylink’s business setup team has never let me down—their on-ground fixers know every shortcut.\
Tangent: Why Bahrain’s Coffee Culture Matters in Business\
You might think coffee service is just hospitality, but in Bahrain, how, when, and with whom you share qahwa can shape deals. During one tense negotiation off Al Fateh Highway, serving traditional coffee at just the right moment diffused tension, built rapport, and nudged the contract across the finish line.\
This unspoken aspect of business etiquette is part of what makes Bahraini networking unique, and it’s often at the intersection of tradition and efficiency—mirroring Bahrain’s position within the Gulf’s business scene.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & GCC Market Access\
1. How long does it take to set up a Bahrain company for GCC expansion?\
With eKYC and Sijilat, average times are now 2–5 business days for most WLLs or BSCs if paperwork is in order. For specialty licenses (finance, healthcare), allow 2–4 weeks. Engage Keylink’s experts for the fastest route.\
2. Does a Bahrain company let me trade directly with KSA, UAE, or Qatar?\
Yes, especially after the 2025 unified standards. You can sell, invoice, and even hire staff across the GCC from a Bahrain base. Branch registration in other states is a straightforward process for Bahraini entities.\
3. What are the main costs—and how can I minimize them?\
Total initial setup: BHD 750–2,500 depending on office type and activities. Renewals, government fees, and legal costs are all predictable. For detailed estimates and money-saving tips, see Keylink’s cost guide.\
4. Can foreigners own 100% of their Bahrain company?\
Absolutely. Nearly all activities now permit 100% foreign ownership (see full list). For a handful of regulated areas, a nominee or local sponsor can still help (more).\
5. What post-formation compliance is required for multi-GCC operations?\
Annual audit (if revenue >BHD 250,000), quarterly VAT filings, and e-accounting are mandatory. Use Keylink’s compliance services to avoid fines and delays.\
\
Local insight, the right partners, and efficient digital processes—this is how Bahrain unlocks the entire GCC market for companies ready to grow. If you’re looking for opportunity, agility, and a uniquely welcoming business environment, Bahrain’s doors are open.\

**hdfidelity presents**     

---  

# *The Expeditions & Misadventures of Mouse Capone*
*presents*  
**""It's A Wonderful Misadventure""**     
     
**A Christmas Special**  

Snow pressed down hard on Philadelphia that Christmas Eve. The gutters froze, the trolley bells sounded thin and lonely, and Mouse Capone trudged through Market Street with his hat pulled low.

The newsstand by 12th Street carried the day’s gossip rag. Mouse almost walked past until a headline snagged his eye:

**“CAIRO MUSEUM DIRECTOR ISABELLA FURRINGTON WELCOMES TWELFTH CHILD.”**

A photo: Isabella in her furs, standing on the steps of a grand estate. A husband beside her — not Mouse — and children clutching at her skirt. She was radiant. Secure. Safe.

Mouse felt something cold squeeze his chest. He crumpled the paper and tossed it into the slush.

---

At the club later, things only soured. **Blue Puppy** burst in out of breath, ears drooping. “Boss… I lost the shipment. Monkey Tycoon’s boys cut us off. They—they took everything.”

The room went silent. Rudy cursed under her breath. Faraday’s tail lashed sparks off the floor.

Mouse rubbed his eyes. He could already feel the Syndicate’s squeeze. And sure enough, an hour later, a slick envelope slid under the club’s front door. Inside: a card embossed with Monkey Tycoon’s smirk, and the words:

**“TIME’S UP, CAPONE. HAND OVER YOUR ROUTES OR YOUR CREW PAYS.”**

Mouse’s stomach turned. He looked at Blue Puppy — trembling, trying not to cry — then at Minx, whose eyes were dark with worry.

He squared his shoulders. “Nobody touches my crew. Not Monkey. Not anyone. I’ll take the heat.”

But when he stepped outside into the cold, the doubt gnawed at him.
Was it worth it? Sticking his neck out, keeping this crew afloat, when the city seemed determined to grind them down?

In the hush of the avenue river bridge, Mouse muttered, “Maybe the world’d be better off if I was never in it.”

And that’s when the snow flared, and a figure tumbled from the sky into the river — the **Red Baron Caterpillar**, wings bent, goggles steaming. He cursed in German, then dusted himself off.

“Capone? You picked a hell of a night to despair. Lucky for you, I’m your guardian. Name’s Clarence. Well—Baron Clarence. I earn my wings by fixing sorry cases like yours.”

---  

Snow and neon melted into a grey hush. Market Street was gone. Mouse stood on a hill above a city that looked familiar but wrong — blocky high-rises, no jazz pouring from basement doors, no little crews weaving through alleys.

The Caterpillar flicked open his ledger. “Philadelphia, without Mouse Capone.”

They walked.

First stop was the corner where Mouse’s club used to be. In its place stood a chrome-and-glass “family supper club,” garland in the windows, piped carols on a loop. Patrons ate quietly at identical booths.

“Where’s Minx?” Mouse asked.

Inside, on a small stage, Minx stood in a sequined gown, fronting a clean corporate frog jazz trio. Her tail was still, her playing precise. She smiled at the crowd — a real smile — and when she saw a child at the front, she bent to hand him a candy cane.

“She’s doing better,” Mouse whispered. “She got out.”

“Some do,” the Caterpillar said. “Without you, Minx took a scholarship, played the clubs straight, made it to the nice side of town. She doesn’t even know your name.”

Mouse felt a stab of pride and pain mixed. “Good for her,” he muttered.

They walked on. A winter wind blew, carrying the smell of cheap coffee and bad decisions. The Caterpillar stopped at a chain-link fence around a city shelter.

Inside, a young **Blue Puppy** huddled on a cot, thinner than Mouse had ever seen him, fur patchy. He wasn’t bouncing off the walls. He wasn’t even looking up.

“He never got adopted,” the Caterpillar said softly. “No Mouse to pull him out of the pound, no crew to teach him the ropes. The city chewed him up and spat him out.”

Mouse pressed his paw to the fence. “Kid…”

Blue Puppy didn’t look up. A volunteer handed him a bowl of food. He ate slowly, eyes on the floor.

The Caterpillar snapped his ledger shut and they moved on.

Last stop was an abandoned rail yard. Snow drifted through broken windows. In the corner a hunched figure scribbled on the walls with chalk, feathers in disarray.

“Featherstone,” Mouse breathed.

Professor Featherstone was muttering equations and riddles to himself, eyes wild, no students to quote poetry at, no lab to tinker in. Without Mouse’s racket to fund his eccentricities, he’d fallen into madness.

Mouse took a step toward him but the Caterpillar held him back. “He can’t see you. This isn’t your world.”  

---  

The Baron’s shadow spread like a great clockface over the frozen Atlantic as they drifted again. “Another stop,” it said, “the ones you called your anchors.”

Mouse blinked at a snowy quay that hadn’t existed for a hundred years. Stone arches, iron lamps, gulls screaming over half-sunk barges. And there, unloading crates under the moonlight, were two hulking silhouettes: Ivan and Boris, the twin bears. Their fur was shaggy, their shoulders bent. No matching jackets, no new-world swagger — just patched work coats and old world scarves.

They heaved barrels of brine and saltfish down a gangplank in silence. No coded jokes, no card games on the dock, no conspiratorial nods. They were muscle for hire, still, but muscle chained to a port that had forgotten them. A harbormaster tossed them coins as if to dogs.

Mouse pressed his nose to the frost on the window of air. “They never crossed?”

“They never had anyone to take the chance with,” said the Baron. “Without you they stayed here, shuffling cargo for petty smuggling rings, never seeing the cities you showed them, never learning to laugh like outlaws.”

Boris wiped his paws on a rag. Ivan lit a cigarette, staring out across the black water. On the far horizon a liner’s lights glimmered like a string of pearls — a ship bound west. Neither of them moved.

Mouse’s whiskers drooped. “They look like ghosts.”

“They are ghosts of a choice,” the Baron murmured. “All your lives bent around one another. Pull out a single strand and everything frays.”

The bears turned back to their work, and the snow swallowed their shapes. The quay dissolved into ash. Mouse was left with the sound of gulls fading into nothing.

---  

The frost-smudged quay fell away and the Baron’s wingtip traced another circle in the dark.
“Two more,” he said softly. “The ones who sharpened each other.”

Mouse blinked again and found himself looking down at a dim rehearsal hall lit by a single flickering bulb. There was Puck the Platypus—no quicksilver glint in his eyes, no portfolio under his arm, no half-mad schemes spilling from his bill. He sat slouched on a folding chair, staring at a script he’d never finish. Around him the room smelled of stale coffee and mothballs.

Across the stage, White Leopard, once a white-hot teacher and actor whose claws left marks in your soul—sat behind a desk, drowsy. No critiques, no biting lines, no feral elegance. His scarf was askew. His gaze drifted out the cracked window. Without Puck pushing him, challenging him, mocking him, he’d slid into comfort; a teacher taking attendance, a cat with no hunt left.

Mouse watched as Puck shuffled up to hand in a half-scribbled page. White Leopard nodded absently and stamped it. No clash, no fire. Just two predators declawed by inertia.

“They look tired,” Mouse murmured.

“They are,” the Baron said. “You were the stone in their shoe. Without you, Puck never learned to dream bigger, and White Leopard never had to defend his throne. Together they settled into a slow forgetting.”

Mouse pressed his paw to the invisible glass. The smell of sawdust and paper rose like a ghost. In some far-off corridor he could almost hear their old bickering, the dueling monologues, the applause of a class electrified. Here there was only silence.

The Baron’s wing cut a slow arc. “Shall we?” he said.

The stage dimmed, the chairs folded themselves into shadow, and the two shapes—platypus and leopard—slumped into stillness as the tour moved on.

---  

Mouse’s whiskers trembled as the Red Baron Caterpillar floated them down a corridor of night, its edges glittering like shattered glass. Every door they passed was a window into a life he might have never touched.

They stopped at a low-lit warehouse. Neon crackled against sheet-metal walls, and through a jagged opening Mouse could see Rudy the female mechanic lizard and Faraday the alligator technician. Both wore their trademark welding goggles like crowns. Both were laughing — that wild, reckless laugh Mouse remembered from a hundred improvised getaways.

Except here the laughter wasn’t his.
Here Rudy and Faraday were still running, still engineering impossible break-ins and hair-raising escapes — only for someone else. Their new crew wore unfamiliar colors. A jackal in a pinstripe coat barked orders. A sleek swan counted out shares from a glittering pile. Rudy snatched her cut with a grin. Faraday tossed a blowtorch from claw to claw like a toy.

“They’re fine,” Mouse murmured. “They’re still doing it.”

“Fine?” The Baron’s mandibles clicked softly. “They’re alive, yes. But what are they building, Mouse? Without you, no one ever taught them to slow down. No one ever challenged them to aim higher than just the next score.”

Inside the window Rudy was tweaking a bomb’s timer with one claw while drinking with the other. Faraday laughed, but it was a brittle sound. The jackal barked again and they both straightened up, obedient.

Mouse’s stomach turned. “They look… happy.”

“They look busy,” the Baron said. “They’ve traded danger for belonging, but it’s a belonging that can vanish the moment the cash dries up. Without your crew, without your odd, misfit loyalty, they never became more than the sum of their tricks.”

Mouse pressed a paw against the glass. “I didn’t think— I thought they’d be better off without me.”

“You all thought that once.” The Baron’s wings unfurled like torn velvet. “This is what the world does with strays when no one pulls them into something bigger.”

The window went dark. The smell of ozone lingered where Rudy’s blowtorch had been. Mouse’s paw hung in midair a heartbeat longer, then dropped to his side. He didn’t notice he was clenching it until his claws left tiny crescent marks in his palm.

“Come on,” said the Baron softly. “There’s still more to see.”

---  

Mouse’s claws curled. “Stop it. I’ve seen enough.”

“Not yet,” said the Caterpillar. “One more.”

He snapped his ledger again. Snow swirled, and now they stood before the rowhouse — tidy curtains, warm lamplight. Through the window sat cardigan-Mouse and **Isabella Furrington**, with their disfigured kittens and their cocoa.

“This is the life you could have had,” the Caterpillar said. “Safe. Respectable. Mundane. But no Minx, no Blue Puppy, no Featherstone. None of them.”

Mouse stared through the glass. The domestic scene glowed like a holiday card. He’d wondered about Isabella for years, about the road not taken. Now here it was, framed in frost.

He swallowed hard. “Looks nice,” he said.

“It is,” the Caterpillar said gently. “It’s also empty.”

Mouse watched cardigan-Mouse chuckle at Isabella’s joke. Watched the kittens play. And felt a hollow grow in his chest.

“I guess…” he whispered, “Even with Monkey Tycoon... Even with the screw-ups...”

The Caterpillar smiled, for the first time all night. “Then you’ve already got your answer.”  

---  

Snow whipped like ticker tape, the brownstone dissolved, and Mouse stumbled back into darkness. The Caterpillar’s voice trailed off behind him: “Go on then, go home, pal…”

He blinked. He was standing outside his own club — the same peeling neon sign, the same dented brass handle. Inside, the house band was tuning up. Minx’s sax cut through the chatter like a blade of light.

Mouse pushed through the door. Warmth and sound wrapped around him. The club was full — not with strangers, but with his people. **Minx** onstage, tail flicking, coaxing a low, honey-smoked riff out of her horn. **Blue Puppy** darting between tables with a tray of mismatched drinks, yipping greetings, already forgetting the sleep-dart fiasco. **Professor Featherstone** at the bar, feathers rumpled, reciting some obscure verse to **Rudy** and **Faraday**, who were both rolling their eyes but smiling.

No cardigans, no station wagon. Just the messy, miraculous crew he’d somehow assembled.

Mouse stayed in the doorway for a beat, letting the sound sink in. In the glow of the stage lights Minx caught his eye. She didn’t stop playing, but a small smile curved her mouth around the reed. It was the smile of someone who had been there at the start, who’d seen every near-miss, every harebrained plan, and still played on.

He crossed to the bar, ordered nothing, just stood and listened. For the first time all night the noise didn’t feel like a racket. It felt like proof.

Blue Puppy skidded up to him. “Boss! You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost!”

Mouse ruffled the pup’s ears. “Something like that, kid.”

Onstage Minx shifted into a slow, swaying melody — a song about not tracking anymore dirt into the house. Mouse found himself grinning.

“Good to be home,” he murmured.

In the rafters, unnoticed, the **Red Baron Caterpillar** hovered a moment, ledger in hand. He scribbled something, snapped it shut, and with a satisfied hum wings appeared on his shoulders, and he zipped off into the night sky.

So, about a year ago, my sister was pregnant and planning this huge gender reveal party. I was excited — she’s my only sibling and I was genuinely happy for her.

Except… I never got an invite. When I asked her about it, she straight-up said, “It’s kind of an upscale thing, and honestly… you don’t really fit in. You’re broke and it’s embarrassing.”

For context, at the time I was between jobs, driving a beat-up car, and not exactly Instagram material. Yeah, it hurt. I swallowed it and just congratulated her privately. But I’ll admit, that stung more than anything.

Fast forward. I landed a new job shortly after. Tech industry. Worked my butt off, got promoted fast, and then invested smart. Things took off. Within a year, I went from “embarrassing broke sibling” to owning my own place, a new car, and having a solid savings account.

Meanwhile, her boyfriend’s “business ventures” tanked. He lost his job, and they’re now living paycheck to paycheck.

Last week, my sister called me crying, saying they’re on the verge of losing their house and asking if I could help with a “small loan.”

I met them for coffee. She gave me the whole speech about family sticking together, how her baby deserves stability, etc. I just listened. When she was done, I told her:

> “Family does stick together. That’s why it hurt when you didn’t want me around because I was broke. You said I was embarrassing. Well, I’m not broke anymore — but I’ll never forget how you treated me when I was. I don’t owe you anything, and I won’t be your safety net. Good luck.”



I left the money on the table for my coffee and walked out.

Now half my family is blowing up my phone calling me cold and heartless. My mom thinks I should have helped “for the baby’s sake.” But honestly? That door closed the second I was told I wasn’t “good enough” for a party celebrating that same baby.

Am I approaching this wrong?,"My partner and I recently opened our relationship and while I initially had someone in mind to “take the training wheels off” so to speak, his life had some bumps and he’s just mentally not in a good headspace to be that person for me anymore. I have a few other connections I’ve made but all online and spread out across the states, aka not close enough. 

So I joined Feeld, reactivated and messed with my old tinder account, and here we are. I’ve only been on Feeld for a week now and I absolutely hate it. I’m in a small town, so there aren’t a ton of local people, but we’ve got a big(ish) city fairly close by. So far the matches I’ve made have been…less than ideal. I’m brand new to this, and say so in my profile. I’ve reiterated it multiple times in chat too because I don’t want to mislead anyone. So far everyone wants to either use me to jerk off, which whatever 🙄 that’s fairly annoying, or wants to meet like the next day to have sex. Which I also outline is not something I’m into. No talks of just like, hey let’s meetup for coffee or dinner to get to know each other. 

I’m new, I’m plus sized and very self conscious, I want to make sure I’m not going to get murdered or have boundaries disrespected. Am I the crazy one here for not immediately wanting sex? 

What do you consider an adequate amount of time before meeting someone? Do you think it’s odd or unusual to want the first meet to not be sexual or at least not anticipated? What do you do to walk the line between having conversations about your kinks, desires, sex and boundaries that doesn’t just turn into sexting for him to jerk off?

Also, I do have it listed I’m newly open, and that I’m looking for more of a FWB situation rather than ONS. That connecting and knowing someone a bit is important to me. 

Any and all advice is appreciated 😅

If you were a nobody in the late 2000s to early 2010s, then there's a chance you might've had a successful hit out of nowhere. The middle-half of the 2010s was all about electropop ""rock"" acts like 3OH!3 dominating the scene. It was also centered around superstar producer J.R Rotem. Well, not really. The Swedish songwriters that made clubby, exciting, synth-reliant pop music like RedOne and Max Martin were a dominant force in that era. But J.R was there. And thanks to the help of Fall Out Boy's lead songwriter Pete Wentz, their forces combined to form one of the most forgotten hits of the 2010s.

In the late 2000s to early 2010s, J.R Rotem was [on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(Rihanna_song)) [a constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Girls_(Sean_Kingston_song)) [winning streak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_It_Baby#Bust_It_Baby_Pt._2) [of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boss_(Rick_Ross_song)) [back-to-back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_in_Time) [Top 40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(Iyaz_song)) [hits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_(Iyaz_song)), [helping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatcha_Say) [produce some of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_My_Head_(Jason_Der%C3%BClo_song)) [most radio-friendly pop music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridin%27_Solo) of that era. He's birthed tons of careers from that winning streak like Jason DeRulo, Sean Kingston, Iyaz, and especially The Ready Set.

Todd briefly mentioned this guy as one of the few ""teenybopper"" acts that tried to recreate What I Like About You on his Nine Days episode, but he hasn't gotten deeper into his story.

With a name like The Ready Set, you'd expect that Love Like Woe was performed by a band. But NOPE. It's actually a stage name, just like Secondhand Serenade or Five For Fighting. A young Jordan Witzigreuter was signed up for drum lessons by his mother at 11 years old. After he played more instruments, he started touring with underground bands like brideandgroom, Take Sides, and Saints Never Surrender. And just like his future indie pop peer Owl City, he made music at the basement of his childhood home. And then he submitted his music to Myspace, known as the breeding place of many famous musicians. He performed at a coffee shop he worked at, and from there, he became a rising star.

Later, Pete Wentz signed Jordan to his label, Decaydance, known for signing most pop/rock flash-in-the-pans in the early 2010s. And in 2010, he released I'm Alive, I'm Dreaming through Decaydance and Beluga Heights, J.R Rotem's record label.

Love Like Woe was a massive radio hit, and it peaked at #27 on the Hot 100. I have a mixed feeling on this song. Not only is it kinda generic, but it has an early 2010s MP3 file vibe to it. And when it gets to the final chorus of the song, they bring in the airhorns, therefore telling you that the song is dated.

The failed-follow up was More Than Alive. Not only did it not chart, but it doesn't have a Wikipedia page, meaning that I can't even see how well it did. It's kinda decent enough. ""Young Forever"" (not to be confused with Jay-Z's desecration of the famous Alphaville song) peaked at #5 on the Bubbling Under chart. That's basically an achievement for him, if you don't realize that the Bubbling Under chart is basically the bottom half of the Hot 100. Nothing else charted. He also created a few supergroups.

In conclusion, he was basically the poor man's Owl City, in the same manner that the other bygone relics of late 2000s-early 2010s radio like The Script, the poor man's Coldplay, Matt Nathanson, the poor man's Jack Johnson, and Augustana, the poor man's Fray.",1,1758358364.0,ToddintheShadow,2,0.67,False

Chapter 1

Lydia Alison

Five Years Ago

""Are you kidding me?"" Lydia cried, glowering at Pete.

He leaned back in his chair, calm as a cucumber, as if he hadn't just broken her whole world.

""Come on, babe. It's better this way.""

Lydia shook her head. She couldn't wrap her mind around the fact that Pete had taken her out on a break-up date. Who breaks up on a date?

“How is it better?” she asked, trying not to let her voice tremble or to sound like she was going to cry. Which was exactly what she felt like doing. “We’ve been together for two years, and you’re just throwing it all away.”

“I’m not throwing it all away, babe.” He leaned forward, reaching for her hand over the table.

""Don't call me that,"" she snapped, pulling her hand away from his. ""You're dumping me. You can go right back to using my name.""

""Fine, Lydia Alison,"" Pete said with her name tasting bitter in his mouth. ""I'm being nice here, and you're not being very receptive to me right now.""

Lydia snorted a sarcastic bark of laughter. ""You're right, what a thoughtless thing to do. I'll take notes so the next time you dump me, I'm more polite about it.""

He sighed heavily. ""Don't be like this.""

Lydia crossed her arms over her chest. ""I'll be however the hell I choose. You don't get to make demands anymore.""

He shrugged. ""Okay. Sure. I guess you're right.""

Damn straight she was right. Pete was dumping her. Lydia suddenly realized there was no reason she had to be here. He’d said his piece—they were over. He’d already explained that he wasn’t ready to make a commitment. There was nothing left for her to do or say here.

Lydia stood to leave.

“Wait,” Pete said. “We’re not going Dutch on the check?”

Her mouth dropped open. ""Get the check yourself, asshole,"" she spat and turned on him.

Lydia held back her tears until she'd reached the door of the bar where they'd gotten together, and at least halfway down the street to the bus stop. When the tears did spill down her cheeks, a sob racked her throat.

She pulled out her phone and called Deby.

""He dumped me,"" Lydia wailed into the phone.

""Whatever?"" Lydia, my God!

""I know,"" she said. ""He bought me a drink. We shared a beer, then we ordered the greasy pub food I love so much. And then he dumped me. After we'd spent a nice afternoon together.""

""I don't believe it,"" Deby said. ""I have to involve Silver in this conversation, too.""

Lydia nodded, allowing Deby to dial Silver in on the call so they were on three-way. Her two best friends were saints, always there when shit hit the fan.

And shit had just hit the fan big time.

They'd all attended college as a group. Lydia was an art major, Deby communications and Silver to become a teacher but they'd roomed together the first year and they'd been locked at the hip ever since.

""Lydia, are you okay?"" Silver asked when she hopped on the line. ""Deby said she talked to you before she put me through.""

“I’m fine,” Lydia lied. She felt like collapsing on the curb in a puddle of tears.

“He doesn’t deserve you,” Silver said fiercely.

""I left him with the bill this time. We always split it,"" Lydia said. For some reason or other, she felt bad about doing that. But that was her problem—she was too nice. She always seemed to get walked on because she was nice and she didn't want people to have to go out of their way for her. So, she ended up putting herself last.

All the time.

She had been a secondary character in her own story when she should have been the spotlight lady who received all the attention. And this just confirmed it. Not even Pete wanted to go out with her anymore.

""It's good you made him suffer,"" Deby said. ""I wish you could have gotten back at him more, really made his life miserable somehow.""

Silver agreed.

""Don't want to make his life hell,"" said Lydia. ""Just… have to move on.""

That wasn't going to be easy. Lydia was in love with Pete. Hell, until half an hour ago, she hadn't even realized something was wrong between them. She was just starting her last year of college, and he graduated last year. They were seriously thinking of moving in together, finding out what the rest of their lives were like. Lydia had been ready to do the long-term thing with him.

And he hadn't managed to see beyond today.

Lydia swallowed a sob.

""Do you know what you need?"" Deby asked. ""A rebound,"" she went on before Lydia could guess. ""You need to go out and get into bed with some hottie who will make you forget all about that idiot.""

""Fantastic idea! Don't waste any time on that loser,"" Silver agreed enthusiastically.

""I don't know, you guys…"" Lydia wasn't exactly the kind of girl who slept around. She was a long-term relationship girl to the core. One-night stands didn't do it for her.

""We should go out,"" Silver said. ""We can get you drunk on alcohol. When you're too drunk to decide if the guy's hot enough to bring home, we'll decide for you."" She was triumphant-sounding.

""I'm working tonight,"" Lydia said.

She walked up to the bus stop and glanced around at the other people waiting to catch the bus. There were only two. One listened to earphones in his head, and wouldn't give heed to her conversation. The other read a book.

""Come on,"" Deby grumbled. ""Call off your shift.""

“I can’t do that. Besides, I’m saving up money for…” Lydia didn’t know how to finish that sentence. She’d been saving up money so that Pete and she could get a place after college. Now, that wasn’t going to happen. But she would still need a place to stay, whether it was with him or not. Her stomach turned and she felt sick. God, all of this was so unexpected. And so unfair.

The bus rumbled toward them.

“I have to go,” Lydia said. “I’m working my shift, and then I’m going to bed. We’ll talk tomorrow.”

The girls grumbled that they couldn't take her out for a little while longer, but the next thing Lydia knew, they had backed down, and she hung up on them. She boarded the bus, numb, and sat in one of the seats at the back. She leaned her head on the glass and let the city roll by as the bus made its way through the streets of Los Angeles, taking her home to her student housing.

Her shift at Café Noir started at five and went on until one in the morning. The café itself was a small place during the day, offering food and hand-brewed coffee. At night, they rolled out the cocktail menus and craft beers, and the patrons shifted from sober daytime professionals to raucous students.

Lydia loved working there—it was always a great mood, and because she'd been working at the café almost as long as she'd been going to classes, it felt like a home away from home.

""Hi, Lydia,"" her coworker Xender greeted when she came to start her shift and he concluded his. ""You okay? You look…""

""I'm fine,"" Lydia answered before he could say the rest of his words. ""Just a tough week with classes and exams.""

You've got some days off later on, don't you? Then you can have a rest,"" he said to her.

""Yeah, that's right,"" Lydia said agreeably, and he smiled in sympathy at her before he left.

Lydia moved over to the counter, ready to wait on the customers coming in for the late afternoon rush, and tried not to think of Pete at all.

It would not be good if she cried over a person's coffee. That was simply unprofessional.

Time went by and orders changed from coffee to cocktails as dinner orders started coming in. Lydia rushed, back and forth, focused on work so that she did not have to even think about anything else. Her thoughts kept drifting toward Pete, and when she forced it away, she was thinking of what Deby and Silver had suggested—a rebound. But she could not do that.

Could she?

Lydia had been in a two-year relationship until today. She'd been envisioning the future. Her mind had been looking ahead of her, not at what she could have now, and not at getting her physical needs. Instant gratification was not even on her radar.

She felt as though the rug had been pulled out from under her.

Two black coffees, and the best stout you have available,"" a soft voice said. Lydia looked up.

Oh. My. God.

Blue eyes that rivaled anything she'd ever laid eyes on cut through her, and they sat atop a face that would have only been sculpted by angels. He was the epitome of tall, dark, and handsome, with sun-tanned skin that made him look as though he jogged along the beach in the mornings, broad shoulders, a sense of confidence, and a smile on his face that flipped her stomach.

""Right behind you,"" Lydia managed to get out, which was a damn miracle because Mr. Hot-as-Hell's look had rendered her speechless. She turned her back to him and started getting his order ready. Two coffees and a stout—that was the order, right? Good thing he'd talked before she'd seen his face because she wouldn't have been able to hear what he said.

What was the matter with her? She didn't usually see blokes like him. But if blokes were like him, she's sure she would have looked twice. Relationship or not.

As she'd put the two coffees down on the counter,

He smiled at her and her heart juddered.

""Let me just get that beer,"" said Lydia.

He nodded, and Lydia made her way over to the beer taps to dispense the stout. She grabbed the pint glass and carried it over to the counter and set it down, calculating the price in her head.

He pulled out a thick wad of bills and smiled at her again. Cue butterflies.

""Keep the change,"" he said.

Thanks. Here you are,"" Lydia said, offering him a tray to hold the coffee and the beer so he would not have to carry them all.

""Thanks,"" he said. He gave her that smile and walked away.

The encounter had been simple enough. But Lydia shivered, her stomach knotting once more, and she observed him approaching another table with another man and a woman.

Her stomach dropped a little. Was he already taken?

Lydia sneaked glances at him throughout the rest of the evening as she worked, watching his crew's body language. They were far enough away from the counter that she couldn't quite hear what they were saying, and the more the night revved up and hectic she got, the less she could monitor them. But eventually, the other man leaned in and kissed the girl, and Lydia was somehow satisfied.

They were a couple. Mr. Dreamy was a third wheel. Which didn't necessarily mean he was unattached—a guy that adorable has got to have some sort of supermodel girlfriend. But still, a girl could dream.

They rose and left, and Lydia's stomach dropped once more when the table was empty. She would've adored even to get in a word with him again.

But guys like him didn't get taken in by girls like her.

Just as good. She never had to get hurt one more time.

It would have been wonderful, though, if at least something in her life worked out the way things did in the movies. Because she'd lost her happily-ever-after and all already, she was due some sort of good luck.

Lydia wiped down the counter while waiting for the next person to order. It was almost midnight and it was almost dead. They were in the process of closing up. And then she had to linger and assist with cleaning up before going home.

Someone came up to the counter and cleared his throat.

As Lydia glanced up, she stood immobile. Again, she was caught by Mr. Cdik Eyes' stare.
Chapter 2

Henry Luther

Shit, she was adorbs. Smoldering hot, too, not just hot. But there was the way she looked at me, the way her mouth seemed to always be on the verge of smiling, and it got me over to say something to her.

""Hey, Lydia,"" I said as she raised her eyes to meet mine, blinking as if I were some ghost.

She'd gazed down at her name tag, where I'd discovered the lovely name of hers. And then she'd gazed up.

""Hi,"" she'd said. ""Would you like… could I get you something? I think we close our kitchen now, but…"" She'd looked over her shoulder at the kitchen. She was on edge, and that only made her lovelier.

And she was already stunning, with fire-red hair spilling over her shoulder in loose waves, and big brown, round eyes that dared me to fall into them.

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Your number.""

She blinked. ""What?""

""I'm being forward,"" I told her. ""Sorry for that. You're just the most beautiful thing I've seen in a very, very long, long time. And I couldn't possibly allow the opportunity to pass to hang out with you."".

She blinked at me afterward flushed the shade of her cheeks.

""I'm not a thing,"" she bristled.

I laughed. Oh, God. Feisty, too. She was the complete package.

""I just told you you're pretty, and all you got was that I called you a thing?""

She shrugged. ""I don't like being spoken to like the staff.""

I laughed again. ""I wasn't trying to treat you like staff. Bad choice of words. You're the prettiest woman I've seen in ages. Better?""

She nibbled on her lip, then nodded rosily.

Shit. Already, she was getting me out of my head. I grinned.

""And I'd like to spend some time with you. Would you like to have a drink with me?""

She dithered.

""There's still time before you close, isn't there?"" I asked.

""I'm not supposed to drink when I work,"" she said.

""Who's going to know?"" I asked. ""We're the only ones here.""

As she swung round, she realized I had been right. There were no other customers remaining. All the rest had shut up and gone home. It was a minute past twelve, and there was still hours' time to serve a couple of beers.

She pondered it in her mind, I could tell. And it was bloody stifling.

""Okay,"" she said eventually.

I grinned at her. ""Okay.""

She disappeared and a second later, she reappeared with two beers.

We walked over to the table where I sat with my college friend, Savon, and his girlfriend, Heppie.

""So, Lydia,"" I welcomed them when they sat down.

""Most people call me Lydia,"" she answered. ""The name tag is formal."" She smiled and stroked her fingers across the tag on her breast.

""Savon.""

She smiled. ""Hi, Henry.""

I grinned to have my name spoken from her mouth.

""So, Lydia, what do you do? Apart from working here?""

""I'm a student,"" she said. ""I'm studying art.""

I whistled through my teeth. ""That's impressive.""

""Is it?""

""Surely,"" I said to her. She blushed to the compliment. I only envied a lot of art students. It was a difficult vocation—it was passion to them all because the majority of them didn't go far in the vocation of art. Learning money from something like that, regardless of how much you loved it, wasn't simple.

""What about you?"" she inquired.

I graduated from college last year. I'm just completing an internship now.

""So what are you going to do, then?"" she inquired.

I had beer. ""Business school.""

""Seriously?""

I nodded. ""I want to make a difference, you know? But not the kind that most people say they want to.""

""How, then?""

""Gourmet food.""

She laughed, and I was done. I could be hooked on that sound.

""Hi,"" she said, nudging me in the shoulder with a grin of enjoyment at the contact. ""Good food brings people together. And it makes a very profitable business, too.""

""I admire your passion. Where is your school?""

""New York.""

Did I imagine it, or did her expression droop?

I was departing for New York City in two days to start graduate school. I had worked hard to get to where I was, and I would work harder when I got to the Big Apple.

""When are you leaving?"" she asked.

I hesitated, whether to tell her or not. I did not wish to scare her away.

""In two days.""

Her eyes widened. ""Oh, soon.""

I nodded.

Leaving was not easy. I loved LA, but I needed to do this. An MBA would open a multitude of doors for me to push upon. And I had big dreams.

""Well, you'll likely get along just fine in grad school,"" Lydia said. ""It almost sounds like you're really excited to be graduating and starting a business.""

I nodded. ""Absolutely. What's the point if there is no passion?

""Only so,"" she said to me. ""Which is why I'm doing art, despite what I know everybody else has to say to me.""

""I think it's noble,"" I said to her. ""What do you do?""

""I paint,"" she said, her eyes lighting up.

""Ahh. What do you enjoy painting?""

Anything, she said, playfully twisting a curl of her red hair.

""Landscapes, abstract. But portraits are the best. I love people's faces. They always tell something.""

She smiled at me. Her eyes were captivating. I was about to leave, but I needed to know more about her. There was something in her that seemed to be beckoning to me, pulling me in, to see what she was like.

""Are you single?"" I asked.

My question startled me and her as much as it startled me and her.

""Yeah,"" she said, and something flickered across her face too quickly for me to understand.

""Lucky me,"" I said, smiling at her.

She smiled back, and it was beautiful. Deep and rich and real.

""Yeah, I guess you are.""

I downed a swig of my beer. ""So, what do you do besides wait tables at Café Noir or make art?""

""Being a full-time student and working take up most of my time,"" she chuckled.

""What are you doing tonight?"" I asked.

She shrugged. ""After locking up the building and erasing all trace of my having disobeyed the rules tonight—"" she smiled at me ""—I'm probably going home to bed so that I can wake up early enough for classes again tomorrow morning.""

""That's too bad,"" said I.

""Then why?""

""Because I was hoping you'd go out with me tonight to celebrate.""

She blinked at me. ""What are we celebrating?""

""The fact that I ran into the prettiest woman I've ever seen."" I grinned at her and watched the color come to her cheeks.

""Oh, you are smooth, Henry. But bumping into me is not something one should boast about.""

""Oh, Lydia,"" I whispered, moving closer. ""Have you seen yourself?""

She blushed again and I moved forward, placing my hand on her arm. I couldn't help myself. She was drawn to me.

""So, what do you mean?"" I said. ""When you're done here, would you like to go with me?""

""Wherever are we going?"" she whispered.

""Wherever you'd like.""

""For someone who looks as together as you do, I'd think that you'd already have an answer for that question in hand,"" she said.

I smiled. ""You think I look together?""

""Don't you?"" she asked. ""Mean, look at you."" She scoured me with her eyes, and I liked the way she looked at me. ""You're definitely the type of guy to control a boardroom.""

I laughed. ""Is it that obvious that I'm a business major? I couldn't just get by as a carpenter, or a lumberjack?""

She raised an eyebrow. ""Seriously? A lumberjack? I can just imagine you in plaid and boots, staring up at a tree, wondering how much you'll need to bribe it to fall for you.""

I laughed out loud. ""Bribe it?""

""Ah, I can see you exercise,"" she stammered, her cheeks red. ""But your hands are not calloused like a man who runs a chainsaw for a living."" She grasped my hand and placed both hands over my hands. At contact, sparks erupted between them and I held my breath. She gazed up at me before scrutinizing my hand.

I liked the feel of her hands on me, smooth and soft skin, nimble fingers. Her hands were smudged with paint, and the smudges were adorable.

I scooted in closer so that our noses were bent heads together, checking out my hand.

""So, you believe I'll be more skilled at negotiating than at felling trees?"" I asked. My voice was a bit rough.

She glanced up at me again and her lips were inches from my face, I could sense the flashes of gold in those great brown eyes.

""Yeah. And it's good for the planet.""

I laughed. I could smell the shampoo in her hair. I held up my other hand and smoothed her hair behind her ear. Her eyes were locked on mine, and when I leaned forward and kissed her, her eyes closed.

When our lips met, the same fantastic electrical zing happened for me that had when she'd kissed my hand. I pushed my tongue into her mouth and she made a soft groaning sound.

The moan was arousing and sent my dick into a stiffen in my trousers.

I wrapped my fingers around her cheek and kissed her more forcefully, trying to show her the effect she was having. I ran my hands up her back onto her shoulders and into her hair as I pulled her into me. Her arms wrapped around my shoulders. I sniffed her scent, and it made me reeled.

When at last we managed to tear ourselves apart from one another to look into the other's face, she was gasping as though she'd run a mile and her eyes were darker and more intense. Her lips parted very slightly.

""Go home with me,"" I instructed.

She retreated one step.

Shit, did I mess up?

""I need to close the café and do the cleanup,"" she replied.

I nodded. ""I'll help out.""

We stayed there. Everyone else was nowhere to be found, and I helped her close up. We rocked the chairs back onto the tables for the cleaning crew to sweep come morning, wiped the countertops clean, and she started the big industrial dishwasher that someone had already begun.

I never once looked away from her the entire time. I watched her work, keeping up with her as we did. She was gorgeous and poised, all done slowly, like it actually mattered. Her bright red hair fell like a flame down her back in the dim light. When she glanced at me occasionally, her eyes were profound. Her face told me that she was as eager to get out of this place as I was.

After she'd finished the shop and closed the door behind her, she turned to confront me.

""I don't do this,"" she told me.

""Clean up the shop?""

She smiled. ""No. Go home with a guy I just met. It's not normally. my style.""

""Alright,"" I said. What if she changed her mind? I was so needy of her but did not want to persuade her to do something she didn't want. ""Are you completely sure you want to do this?""

""Yes, I am. But I only wanted you to know it.""

I nodded also.

""So, which way?"" she asked.

I took her hand and brought it to my lips, placing my mouth over the knuckles.

""This way,"" I whispered and led her to my car.
Chapter 3

Lydia Alison

She was going away with him.

Lydia hardly knew herself. A one-night stand?

And what was more, she'd just been through a serious relationship. That was who she was— the girl who had serious relationships.

And where had that got her?

Dumped, and humiliated because for some inexplicable reason, Pete just hadn't felt she was good enough to make a commitment to.

And that was totally rubbish.

Maybe she was not one of the girls who walked around campus, who had lots of friends and huge trust funds, but she did have a few things going for her.

And Henry could tell that. He treated her like she was worth something.

Lydia knew that for an extremely long period of time, Pete had made her feel like she wasn't worth anything. She'd just been so caught up in their picture of 'forever' that she hadn't even known how he'd started to ignore her, and how he'd started to treat her like she was a maybe to him, when he'd been a definitely to her for so long.

Henry looked at her as if she was the sole female in the entire world. Although only for this evening, the manner in which he behaved made her feel better.

They drove with the windows open. He edged his hand up along her leg and intertwined his fingers with hers. It was warm, yet sweet, as well. Everything that he did, every little thing, was perfect.

His vehicle was nice. Expensive, but not ostentatious. Lydia liked that about him—he was obviously further up on the economic hierarchy, and he had at least a couple of doors already ahead of him in life. But he didn't let her think it made him. He didn't flaunt it or make her feel like he was only using it to sleep with her.

And that made her want to crawl into bed with him all the more.

However, Henry was a stranger. And Lydia did not go home with strangers. She had always had the notion that going home with strangers meant trouble. But remembering Pete, she knew that even though she had thought that she knew him all this while, it so happened that she had not really known him that well. She would have never guessed that he would go and abandon something they had worked on for so long…

For no reason whatsoever.

And Henry… there was something about him that made him feel like he wasn't a stranger at all. When they talked, it was like he knew her. And Lydia hadn't had that with anyone.

Not with Pete, and not with any of the men she'd dated before him.

Not even with her girlfriends, if she was being truthful. Not like this.

Lydia had just always figured it was because she was an artist. A little weird like everyone else. She had never thought that someone would actually understand her.

But Henry did.

And Lydia was not about to let him go.

So when he had asked her to come home with him, the only answer that had made sense was 'yes.'

They arrived at his apartment and he opened the door and invited her in ahead of him.

""Oh,"" Lydia said when he turned on the lights and she looked around. ""This apartment doesn't look at all like my student apartment.""

Her flat was a bit dingy, with water-spotted ceiling, an oven that she had to wedge open with a broomstick, and a door that she had to apply body weight to get open or shut if she wanted in or out.

Henry's apartment was nicely decorated with smooth modern designer furniture, and it smelled of fresh, manly cleanliness.

Henry was chuckling as Lydia stared at the apartment.

""It's not much, but it's home.""

""Are you kidding me?"" Lydia said. ""If that's your idea of 'not much,' I don't want to see what the rest of your life will be like when you're some zany business mogul.""

Lydia shrugged off her coat and Henry took it from her. A real gentleman.

He laughed. ""You think I'm going to be a business mogul?""

""Oh, yes,"" Lydia said.

He certainly looked the part. She was pretty sure he would be drop-dead gorgeous in a designer suit.

He was already jump-his-bones hot.

All he needed was to take that commanding air a step further and he was going to be everything.

He cupped her cheek, his face close to hers.

“You’re staring,” he mumbled, his lips so close to hers Lydia could barely concentrate on the words he was speaking.

“You’re distracting,” Lydia said.

She sounded like a fool. But he chuckled, and his voice was thick and smooth and it caressed her skin like honey.

When he kissed her, it was just as intense as it had been at the café when he'd kissed her, but this time it was different. There was so much more passion that lay behind it. So much more desire. He crushed the length of his body against hers, and she could feel the shape in his pants, testament to his growing desire for her.

And God, Lydia wanted him. He was nice and handsome and confident—exactly the sort of man she never expected to fall for. And, as a bonus, he wanted her too.

Lydia felt it all the way down to his boxers, where his dick strained against his pants to find her.

It was a blaze igniting her body as he thrashed against her. Her gut knotted. Lydia was wet for him.

God, so wet.

Henry ended the kiss and gazed at her.

""Can I get you something to drink?"" he asked.

Was he kidding? Lydia didn't need anything to drink. Or eat. Or anything that wasn't him naked and on top of her.

Lydia flushed with herself for remembering such things about a total stranger.

But then again, he didn't quite feel like one to her either.

Lydia shook her head and kissed him, running her hands across his chest.

He laughed into her mouth and pulled her against him. His hands moved onto her ass, and he lifted her off the floor. Lydia yelped. He scooped her up like she was lighter than air, and when she wrapped her arms around his shoulders, she felt the muscles harden as he bore the weight. Lydia wrapped her legs around his waist and he carried her into the bedroom. His tongue was in her mouth again and Lydia moaned softly, dimly sensing the apartment through the fog of lust as he urged her into the bedroom.

He didn't bother to flip on the lights—the bedroom was filled with light from seeping from the other rooms—and he shoved her onto the bed. Lydia laughed for no reason afterward. She was intoxicated with lust. He smiled at her.

He was on her in a second, kissing her, his fingers probing her body, caressing her, tracing the contours of her with his fingers.

He pulled up her shirt, exposing her bra, and bent his head to her chest. He kissed down the length of her bra cup, leaving a path of flames down the soft flesh of her breasts.

Lydia drew her top over her head, and strained back when Henry tried to come around her. He unbuckled her bra and drew it away from her, and Lydia stood before him, topless.

For a moment, Lydia was shy. No matter how immediately close she felt to him, he was still unknown to her. And she was suddenly as good as naked. His eyes slid over her breasts and then back to her face.

“You’re gorgeous,” he said.

Lydia blushed and he leaned forward to kiss her. He took hold of her left breast, his fingers firm and confident, and had a very clear idea of what he desired. Lydia moaned as he manipulated her breast, his fingers finding her rigid nipple, and rolled it with his thumb and forefinger.

Lydia gasped and moaned, his sensitivity to her breast causing shudders through her pussy, making her even more moist.

Henry bent his head, breaking the kiss, and his lips captured her right nipple. He drew it into his mouth and Lydia gasped as he sucked and tongued her, holding her between his hand on one and his mouth on the other.

For a second, all Lydia could do was get lost in the sensation of Henry loving her body. He made her feel incredible. And they hadn't even reached the below-the-belt boundary yet—Henry was still wearing pants and Lydia was still wearing hers.

As if he knew Lydia had been thinking about it, Henry started making a journey down her body, kissing his way along her belly. His fingers moved quickly to unbutton her jeans, and he slowly pushed them down her legs, unwrapping her like a gift. Slowly. Sensually, mouth-wateringly.

His fingers seared against the flesh of her skin when he took off her jeans and mapped his hands down her legs. He opened her thighs and blew hot breath across her.
Chapter 4

Lydia groaned and rolled onto the bed.

When he enveloped her in his mouth and slid his tongue across her clit, Lydia screamed.

Lydia pushed her hands into his hair, taking handfuls and interlacing her fingers with his thick dark hair.

Henry started to lap at her tender folds of sex, sucking and licking and pulling her closer and closer to the edge of orgasm.

Lydia trembled and twisted on the bed, pushing his face into her pussy, pushing her hips as she came closer and closer.

As he inserted two of his fingers into her, it was what Lydia had to make her go over. She felt the rush of pleasure wash over her. Lydia shrieked and clamped her thighs closed over Henry's head. Henry laughed and his deep voice resonated through her body, taking up residence at her core as Lydia climaxed.

When Lydia came down from her sexual paradise, Henry pushed up onto his knees and ripped his shirt off over his head. Lydia stared at his body.

God, he was sexy. Ripped as hell, every one of his muscles carved to perfection and beautiful. He was an Adonis, carved by angels and placed on Earth specifically so women like Lydia could drool.

He laughed when Lydia couldn't take her eyes away from him.

""GQ model,"" Lydia blurted out, regretting it. Lydia blushed, but Henry simply laughed.

Lydia got up and started tending to his pants. She popped the button on his jeans, lowered the zipper, and freed his cock.

And God, he was fine. Big, impressive, stretching, silk over metal, and his tip wet with his hunger for her.

Lydia gazed up at him.

He kissed her once more, leaning down, and cupped her cheeks, nudging her back gently so that Lydia rested on her back. He crawled over her, and her legs opened wide for him.

As his cock touched the edge of her entrance, Lydia took a breath in, and exhaled in a deep moan when he thrust into her.

Fuck, he felt amazing.

Lydia shook, her muscles tensing tightly around the width of him.

Henry started moving, and Lydia forgot about everything else in their surroundings. Everything that existed was Lydia and Henry and the raw pleasure that exploded in her center when he started moving in and out of her.

Lydia gripped her hands on his shoulders when he started fucking her. He was utterly in control, pumping his hips, thrusting his cock in and out of her, and Lydia was just along for the ride. Her nails dug into his skin and Lydia screamed on each stroke as he drove deeper and deeper into her.

The sensation started to build another orgasm within her. Lydia surrendered as she fell apart at the seams.

As Lydia came again, her body tightened down on his cock and Henry grunted, reducing his speed until he was thrusting in and out of her excruciatingly slowly.

After Lydia regained breath for her second orgasm, he leaned forward to kiss her.

""Get on top of me,"" he instructed.

""What?""

He kissed her again, this time so hard that Lydia couldn't think.

""I want you to ride me.""

Lydia shivered at the tone he employed. His tone commanding, his eyes a blue that was so sharp that Lydia found herself wanting to do as he commanded. Just as Lydia wanted to take what she needed.

Lydia had not experienced sex this way before, so intense, so sensual and intimate.

Henry rolled onto his back, his cock standing up in the air, ready for Lydia to mount him. Lydia clambered onto him and when she lowered herself onto his cock, they groaned in unison.

“You’re so fucking tight,” he said through gritted teeth.

“It’s you,” Lydia replied, gasping, “your size is… incredible.”

He grinned, but it was fleeting as he drew her down and kissed her. With their lips sealed and their tongues going round and round, Lydia started moving back and forth, shoving his cock in and out of her.

Lydia rocked harder, more quickly, groaned when he drove into her, deeper and deeper.

Lydia groaned and screamed as she rocked harder and quicker, closing her eyes, feeling him.

As Lydia's eyes opened, his were on hers. He closed his jaw and a small crease formed between his eyebrows.

He had her hips in his hands and was thrusting her back and forth harder and deeper than Lydia could do herself. It was magic. Her clit was being rubbed against his pubic bone, and Lydia was rapidly heading for her third orgasm.

Henry ground his teeth, moaning and groaning, and Lydia could see the want in his face, the need.

He was close.

Lydia wished he'd move over. Lydia wished she could push him so he'd release and find the same orgasm he'd just given her.

For a moment, Lydia was focused on him, but the pressure against her clit pushed her over. Lydia shrieked as she came again.

Lydia closed her eyes and parted her mouth on a raw shriek of pleasure.

Henry shrieked a second later, and Lydia felt him spilling inside her, pounding and throbbing, his dick pouring all the pleasure they'd made into her body.

Lydia collapsed onto his chest, and Henry wrapped his arms around her, holding tight for dear life as he pounded into her.

They stayed this way for a while after the orgasm had faded, clinging to one another. Their bodies were slick with sweat and they were so close that Lydia couldn't even determine where she started and he left off.

Lydia had never felt anything like this. Anything that gave her the feeling that it was hers, that it was something beyond sex. And Lydia had never felt anything that had made her feel so great.

As Lydia leaned on her elbows, Henry grinned at her lazily.

""That was so good.""

""It was,"" said Lydia.

Lydia rolled off of him and laid beside him, with sleep washing over her, too.

""Your bathroom is over there,"" Henry said, waving his hand.

Lydia nodded and rolled out of bed, heading into the bathroom to clean herself up. Henry had left a sticky patch between her legs.

After she cleaned herself up, Lydia returned out to the bed. Henry was in bed, and he pulled back the covers so that Lydia could get in with him.

""Lydia wants me to stay?"" Lydia asked.

""Yeah,"" he said, and Lydia crawled into bed.

It was all so perfect. It was too good to happen, nearly. How was it that on the same day Lydia had lost what she thought was her entire future, she had met someone like Henry?

It must have signified.

Coming back with him was the best decision Lydia ever made.

Henry pulled her to him, put his arm about her body and drew her into his side. He put his body in front of hers and sighed.

Lydia closed her eyes, feeling his heat.

This would have to do for the moment.

Lydia had no idea what was going to happen with the new light of day, but for the moment it was exactly what she needed.
Chapter 5

Henry Luther

I opened my eyes and blinked against the light pouring in through open curtains. They were always shut on a morning, and I could sleep in, but today I was wide awake and wide-eyed.

And my bed was empty.

I frowned and sat up, my eyes running over the spot where the covers were tossed back. The spot where Lydia had slept last night.

Where was the devil? And why was she not sprawled in my bed, next to me?

I jerked up, rubbing my eyes, trying to listen for a sound in the rest of the apartment. When I stood up and walked through the rooms, I noticed that her clothes and purse were missing.

She's gone.

Damn.

I turned and went back to the bedroom and found my phone. She hadn't given me her number. I checked anyway, just in case she'd left it on the bed when I was asleep.

When had she gotten up and left? It was still only seven.

I sat on the bed and raked my hands through my hair, frustrated that she was gone and I couldn't call her.

This was not unusual. I screwed girls all the time, and sent them packing the next day. But this time, I hadn't sent her packing. She'd done that herself.

And to top it all, I'd not even wanted her to leave.

The realization hit me with a shock.

Since when did I give a damn about women hanging around? I was serious about school, and the next day I was leaving for New York. I didn't care about becoming serious with anybody.

Anyway, relationships were just trouble. It was easier to fuck them and just send them packing without commitment.

But with Lydia, it had been different. I'd felt something with her that I never felt before.

And not only in bed, either. I'd experienced it with her while we were talking in the café. Hell, I'd even felt that chemistry between them when I ordered from her. I'd just had to talk to her again.

And when I did, she was amazing in every possible way.

Apparently in bed, too.

And now she was gone.

My phone was ringing. Elijah Michael's name was displayed on the caller ID.

""Are you awake?"" he asked.

""I am.""

""Breakfast?""

""Sure.""

""I'll meet you at Farina.""

""Let's go to Café Noir,"" Henry said.

Elijah Michael agreed, and Henry showered and got dressed to meet him.

An hour had gone by, and Elijah Michael and Henry sat at the same table where Henry and Lydia had spoken the night before. Henry glanced over at the counter where all the orders were being called, but she wasn't there.

1nlszj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1nlszj3/keeper_of_my_quiet/,Keeper of my Quiet,"True love — some call it myth, a tale grown tall,
but I have felt its pulse beneath my ribs,
a sudden hush the moment your green eyes met mine,
a hush that made my scattered pieces whole.

You arrived like weather: soft, impossible,
an ember in a winter I had long accepted.
My chest unclenched. My small fierce light leaned toward you.
I gave you that light — not as a loan, but as a vow.

Now the rooms keep playing memories on repeat:
a laugh folded into the clink of coffee,
your name in the hush between trains, the way sunlight
laid an amber path across our kitchen floor.

I carry you like a worn map in my pocket:
sometimes guiding me, sometimes tearing at the seams.
I know the truth — you may never circle back —
and still I hold the hope like prayer, soft and private.

If you find new mornings that fit you better,
if someone else stacks your days with gentler hands,
I will not steal your smile with selfish pleas.
I will stand in the quiet and cheer your sun on.

Keep my heart, then — not to hide or own,
but as one might cradle a fragile thing found on a shore:
tended, warmed, and let go when tides call it free.
It is yours now; I do not want it back.

And if the world bends toward us once more,
I will be waiting — not the same boy who hid in fear,
but a man who learned the weight of truth, the cost of lies,
who grew the stubborn courage to be seen.

Until then — live wildly, love fully, be kind to yourself.
I will root for you from wherever my path runs,
bearing the ache like a constellated map,
a soft, steady light that remembers how to love.",3,1758357786.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,4,1.0,False

I’m 32 and just moved from the US to start studying at Wrocław Medical University (English Division). I’m excited to be here, but so far most of the student crowd I’ve met is quite a bit younger.

I’d love to connect with others in a similar age range (late 20s–30s) — whether you’re also studying, working, or just living in Wrocław. It would be great to grab coffee/cocktails, explore the city, maybe form a study group, or just hang out outside of class.

If you know of groups, events, or communities around Wrocław where older students/expats tend to meet up, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.

1nlssy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1nlssy4/the_destruction_of_yellow_cake/,The destruction of yellow cake,"Look, I ain’t a person who likes sweets that much. It’s always been salty over sweet for me and my cravings. But nothing compares to the simplicity of a simple box of yellow cake. Soft, nearly moist, on the spongy inside. Lightly crispy on every single outer edge. Completely safe and predictable flavors. No extremes. So easily washed down with a beautiful glass of cold milk.

I stepped out of my bedroom to make a coffee and that wonderful baking aroma filled my nostrils. I felt the quiet whir of excitement building within me. It has been years since I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying a home made box cake. And now I don’t live in America anymore and my dad has brought these boxes from back home for us. We only have so many.

But what I saw confused me. Four objects, strangely muffin shaped, were sitting on a small serving plate with powdered sugar on them. I knew that couldn’t be the entire box, so my eyes moved to the stovetop. There, I saw it. A pan shaped for banana bread. With an uneven, folded over in parts, mass of yellow cake.

I was stuck a few steps over at the counter which holds the tools to make coffee. There I watched as my grandmother stabbed free the cake object from the pan and attempted to move it to an even smaller oval serving plate. I heard her curse as the mass split in two, flipping like an object with too much air and too much liquid. She moved this cake with her hands you see.

And then, as if spitting on a corpse, she reached over me to grab the cinnamon on the wall. Suddenly the beautiful scent of yellow cake was gone, replaced by the sweet red spice. I prayed to the nonexistent gods that she would not engage me with pride for her work as I have no ability to lie about this.

You know that meme of a guy smiling above a grave? As if the cinnamon wasn’t enough, she once again reached for the powdered sugar and dressed the 2 broken masses of cake in a gentle snowfall.

My beloved yellow cake is now inedible. I found the box in our recycling bag and read the options for pan sizes, just to make sure I wasn’t tripping due to rules not being followed. Nowhere does it suggest using these deep and skinny pans. The whole ordeal was undeniably done #wrong.

1nlspvc,https://i.redd.it/evr857vf5aqf1.png,AI coding locked me to my desk… here’s what I made to break free,"Hey folks 👋

I’m Nick, a solo founder and indie hacker. Just launched my latest project today on Product Hunt: **Vibe Code Anywhere (Vicoa)** 🚀

The idea came from a frustration I kept running into: vibe coding with AI (Claude Code in my case) is awesome… until you step away.

More than once, I’d start coding on my laptop, then head out for coffee or run an errand — only to come back and find the AI had stopped halfway, waiting on me 😅

So I built Vicoa to fix that:

💻 Start coding with Claude Code on your laptop

📱 Keep coding, monitor progress, or jump in from your phone or tablet

🔔 Get alerts when your AI needs input

🌍 Everything syncs across devices

Basically: code anytime, anywhere — without losing flow.

We’re live on Product Hunt now 🎉

1nlspf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nlspf3/feeling_like_im_29f_emotionally_draining_my/,Feeling like I’m (29F) emotionally draining my fiancé (34M) because of my career struggles,"Hi everyone,

I left my job to move to another country with my (now) fiancé, who was my boyfriend at the time. During that move, I decided to do a software engineering bootcamp.

It’s been about a year since I’ve had a job, and I’m honestly so tired of being jobless. I gave software engineering a try, but I realized it’s not for me. On top of that, I have a lot of limiting beliefs:
	•	I don’t have a bachelor’s degree in computer science
	•	I’m a foreigner
	•	Tech is in a down cycle right now

All of this made it really hard for me, and eventually, I gave up on pursuing it.

So, we moved back to my home country and now I’m looking for work again. The good news is I am getting interviews, but the bad news is that I feel like I’m emotionally draining my fiancé.

He’s been really supportive — he built a whole spreadsheet with me to track applications, outreach, and coffee chats. He believes networking is the most important thing right now, but I really struggle with coffee chats. I don’t enjoy them, and because of that, I haven’t prioritized them. This frustrates him a lot, and we end up in big arguments. He feels like I’m not trying hard enough when I don’t follow the process the way he suggests.

From my side, I am trying — but when he breaks down my process, it makes me feel like I’m constantly falling short. Mentally, I’m not okay. I don’t feel like the same person he fell in love with, and I know this whole situation is tiring for him too.

Another big issue is that he has told me he doesn’t feel comfortable going into marriage with me right now because he feels I’m not consistent and he just feels like I’m not reliable and what if we have kids and i can’t pull my own weight like do research for schools etc . he’s brought up a prenup multiple times. I don’t mind signing it, but it really hurts me that things have gotten to this stage in our relationship because of my career struggles and the way I do things spills over 

Money isn’t a huge issue since he’s financially stable, but I also don’t want to just sit around doing nothing.

I guess my main question is: How do I navigate this dynamic without damaging our relationship? How do I balance his accountability system with my own way of doing things, when I feel so mentally drained? And how do I process the fact that my career struggles are now affecting our marriage discussions?

⸻

TL;DR: Quit my job, moved abroad with fiancé, tried a software engineering bootcamp but gave up. Now back home, job hunting again, and fiancé wants me to network heavily (coffee chats, spreadsheets, etc.) while I feel drained and resistant. He’s also said he doesn’t feel comfortable marrying me right now because of my job search consistency and has brought up a prenup multiple times. I don’t mind signing, but it hurts me that it’s come to this. How do I handle this dynamic without hurting our relationship?
