1ghkhy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ghkhy2/everyone_got_off_at_the_port_except_me/,"everyone got off at the port, except me.","I'm writing this on a bus, coming home early from a frustrated trip. I can't stop thinking about what happened, and I feel like I need to share it with someone else.¬†

This year, a few friends and I decided to take a vacation together and go on a beach trip, planning to stay for about a week. We arranged for everyone to take time off at the same time and rented a house on the coast of a neighboring state.

At first, everything went smoothly, I took the bus around nine PM, and knowing that the trip would take around three hours, I put on my headphones, reclined the seat and enjoyed the view. We agreed to meet at the town‚Äôs port.

At a certain point in the journey, the bus stopped, and the driver informed us he‚Äôd be making a brief stop in a town near our final destination. I went to a restaurant, grabbed some coffee and a sandwich, which I barely had time to finish before the bus started moving again.

I was dozing off when I felt the bus stop. The driver turned off the engine, the lights came on and the passengers began to get off. I quickly looked out the window to check that I was in the right place, and after seeing some containers, I got off too.

That's when things started to get weird.

As soon as I stepped out, I noticed there were no other passengers around, which felt odd since it had been barely twenty seconds since everyone had disembarked. The place I was standing in was just part of the road; it didn‚Äôt even look like a bus stop, much less the port and bus station that my friends had mentioned earlier. The only sign of life nearby was a gate with a guard booth and, inside, a collection of containers and cranes that looked like a shipping company.

When I tried to get back on the bus, to ask the driver if I hadn't gotten off at the wrong stop, he had already left.

I looked at my phone, paused the music, and checked the time: midnight sharp. I called one of my friends to let them know I had ‚Äúarrived,‚Äù hoping that this was the right place. No answer. I only managed to send a quick message ‚Äì ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm at the port‚Äù ‚Äì before my battery died. Apparently, listening to music for three hours straight was just too much for my old phone. With no idea what else to do, I approached the guard booth to ask for information.

Inside was a woman, who smiled when she saw me approaching. I asked her if I was in the right place and explained a little bit of the situation.¬†

""Ah, the port? Oh, no, you‚Äôre far away, about five miles I believe, my dear."" She replied, with a big smile and a voice a little... strange.

I can't explain it, but the woman seemed *off*. Her skin looked different, in a way that I couldn't tell whether she was 26 or 62, and her voice didn't sound natural. At the time I didn't pay much attention to any of this, but in retrospect, it seemed as if she wasn't human, but something *trying* to be human.

""But if you want, you can go through here, James and I will take you to the port, *everything will be fine!*"" She said while gesturing to a colleague who was near the gate.

I hadn't noticed the colleague before. In fact, it's is as if he appeared out of nowhere as soon as she called him. He came towards me, with the same huge smile and strange skin.

For some reason, that gave me chills. Those two looking at me, piercing me with their eyes, and with that sinister smile, almost drooling, as if I were a dish from a five-star restaurant. Something told me not to wait for this ‚ÄúJames‚Äù guy to approach, so I walked away, muttering a goodbye.

I couldn't see much ahead, just the road and the silhouette of vegetation on both sides of the asphalt. There were no streetlights except one in front of the ‚Äúcompany,‚Äù and likely none for the next five miles. I started walking, but I soon realized that it would be a long trek, so I raised my thumb in hope that someone passing by would give me a ride.

And it didn't take long for a truck driver to pull up next to me. I got close to his window, and to my surprise, he didn't look *right* either. He was an older man, or at least I think it was because of his white hair, but he had the same strange skin as the woman and ‚ÄúJames‚Äú I just met. He invited me into the truck, saying he would take me to the port in no time. Strange, because I hadn't even told him where I wanted to go.

""Come on, kid, I'll take you there, you won't even notice! You can sleep if you're tired. *Everything will be fine!*"" The old man insisted. He spoke in the same strange, weirdly *broken* way as the other two.

The chill I had felt before now intensified, and it went up my spine like an electric shock. I didn't even bother to say something to the truck driver, I just moved on, quickening my pace. He just stood there.

From then on, I started to walk faster. I had a weird feeling, as if things weren‚Äôt right, and what scared me the most: that something was watching me.

I rounded a bend in the road and saw a broken guardrail and a crashed car beyond it. It looked like the accident had happened some time ago, but obviously, the scene didn‚Äôt help with my anxiety at all.

The further I got, the more unsettling the place became. The air grew heavy, and I started to hear noises in the vegetation, twigs snapping, leaves rustling. I was getting exhausted from the walk, and my eyes were strained from trying to see in the pitch-dark.

After about two hours of walking, just past another curve, this time forming a big ""S"" along with the previous one, a car stopped next to me. It was an old hatchback, probably from the '90s. I couldn‚Äôt see much, but the car looked run-down. At this point, I was obviously no longer hitchhiking, and my paranoia made me completely suspicious of whoever the driver was.

And with good reason.

""Get in, Alex, I'll take you to the port."" He said, calmly.

""HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?"" I shouted, desperate.

""What do you mean, Alex? We all know your name. We just want to help you! Trust us, *everything will be fine!""* He replied, lifting his head and looking directly at me, with the same massive, twisted smile as the others.

Taking a good look at his face, he looked almost identical to the truck driver, like twins, both equally disfigured and weird.

This time, I ran.

I ran like I‚Äôd never run before, without even looking back to see if anything was following me.

I must have run for another two hours until exhaustion took over, and I sat down on the roadside. Everything seemed quiet and safe. Too safe. I opened my backpack to take the last sip from my water bottle when I began to hear them.

Voices, coming from the bushes next to me. At first, I couldn‚Äôt make out what they were saying, but slowly I began to recognize my name being called.

""Alex... Alex... come this way, Alex... it's a shortcut, Alex... *everything will be fine*, Alex.""

The feeling of safety soon turned to horror, and I went back running.

The voices grew louder, more distorted, and when I inevitably looked back, my fears were confirmed.

There was a man ‚Äì no, a *creature* ‚Äì chasing me. It was humanoid, but with disproportionate limbs and a bizarre skin, as if it were imitating human skin, which writhed and twisted. And it was smiling at me.

That thing came closer, initially walking slowly, but picking up it's pace towards me.

I ran awkwardly, totally consumed by fear, crying and screaming, the creature chasing, obviously faster than me, at one point getting close enough to touche me. And it did. It put it's hand, boney and cold, on my shoulder.

As I fumbled to get away from its grasp, I tripped and went rolling. The thing came after me, opening it's mouth, revealing rotten and missing teeth, kneeling down in my direction.

I've never been a fighter, but at that time some kind of instinct came over me. Somehow I felt this would be my last seconds alive if I didn't try to fight it. So I kicked, punch, did everything I could to get away.

After a few blows to its head, the creature seemed to recoil for a second, looking at me with a twisted and broken smile, mixed with an expression of confusion, as if it didn't believe that I could defend myself like that. To be honest, I didn't believe it either.

But that single moment was enough for me to get up on my feet and start running again.

I soon encountered the first streetlight in what felt like years.

As I got closer, I saw the sea, containers, docked ships, a lighthouse in the distance, and a small group of people. It was the port. I stopped running but was still paranoid and anxious, so I avoided contact with anyone. Looking behind me, at first I saw nothing besides the darkness of that godforsaken road, but squinting my eyes, I could barely see that pale figure, standing still, staring directly at me. For some reason, it had given up on chasing me after I've entered the light.

Then I saw the bus arrive, and exactly the same passengers who were with me got off. Soon I also saw my friends approaching. They were drinking and laughing, and when they saw me, they ran over, shouting and cheering to celebrate my arrival. One of them tried to talk to me, asking me why I was looking terrible, sweating, dirty, and shaking.

I just lit a cigarette, walked with them to the house, a few blocks away, and told them that I was extremely tired and needed some sleep.

When I got there, I left my things in my room, plugged in my phone to charge and went to take a shower. There was a clock in the hallway, and, giving me one last moment of terror, it showed twelve-oh-five.

The next day, my friends woke me up asking about what had happened the night before and why I seemed so scared.

I tried to tell the story, but obviously no one believed it.

Some said I was lying, or that I was smoking some really good stuff. I even opened Google Maps to show where that company was, where everything had supposedly happened, but, to my surprise, I couldn‚Äôt find it.

There was no ""S"" curve on the road. In fact, the road between the town where I stopped to eat and the port of the town we were in was completely straight, well-lit, and without companies, gates or containers. There was even a gas station halfway through, which I sure as shit didn't see last night.

Amid all the jokes and questions, one of the people in the room, who I didn't really know, approached me and said:

""Relax, Alex, I think you just had a weird dream. You're with us now, *everything will be fine*."" He broke into a giant smile as he said those last words in a distorted way.

At that moment I ran up the stairs, grabbed my backpack and went straight to the port to wait for the next bus, without saying anything to anyone.",1,1730507966.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs crazy because university is much more bigger than highschool yet I‚Äôm  struggling to make a genuine friend. 

I also work part-time at a coffee shop, and while my coworkers are nice, I often feel like the odd one out when it's just the three of us. I try to initiate conversations, but they often feel awkward, and I tend to stumble over my words because I realize too late that I‚Äôm talking too fast. This makes me embarrassed, and I can't help but think they don‚Äôt like me. Maybe I‚Äôm just naturally awkward, but it‚Äôs draining because I just want to be myself. It often feels like I‚Äôm the one always reaching out to others, rather than the other way around. Any tips or advice would be appreciated

Barely a newly hatched chick so I could be wrong for a few things. Going to the office isn't a hassle for me. I'm thinking from a future POV/from older employee's POV. 

I think instead of squandering money on things like table tennis, bean bags, free coffee or whatever bullshit, I think the following could help (instead of paying batshit consultant fees to come up with cooked ideas):

-In-house childcare services (either free or heavily subsidised for working parents)

-Offering heavily subsidised rent for workers to those who live far, and paying for transport for workers who live nearby/moderately far.

-Free brekky, lunch and dinner (or heavily subsidised). Really frees up time for employees.

 These might be a few things that could actually incentivise employees to come back rather than trying to spend it on ludicrous bullshit like employee concerts or bean bags or helipad or in-house cinemas. Now, the demands here might be a bit ludicrous, but this will either allow employers to allow employees to do the hybrid model or actually cater to their needs.

1ghkevt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1ghkevt/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1730507708.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

So, this all happened last night, and I‚Äôm still processing the whole mess. I (40M) have really bad social anxiety, and I‚Äôm short‚Äîlike 5'2‚Äîso confidence isn‚Äôt exactly my strong suit. I struggle to interact with others to the point where I haven't had any romantic relationships at this point, haven't even kissed a woman. I don't know how to flirt with someone or anything like that.  I usually keep to myself at work, mostly doing my job and avoiding much small talk. People don't talk to me either, they just ignore my existence unless they HAVE to interact with me, but there‚Äôs this woman, ""Lily"" (28F), who‚Äôs always been incredibly kind to me.

Lily is one of those genuinely warm people who seem to be nice to everyone. She remembers little things, asks how I‚Äôm doing, and actually seems to care about my answers. Over the past few months, we‚Äôve had more little chats by the coffee machine, and she‚Äôd even make inside jokes with me. For someone who‚Äôs been pretty lonely, I started to look forward to those moments, probably way more than I should. I tried not to read into it too much, but I couldn‚Äôt help thinking that maybe, just maybe, she liked talking to me as much as I did to her. 

I just get so happy everytime I see her. She usually waves at me and says hi everyday (no one else has ever treated me this way) and initiates conversations with me. She's also kinda touchy - once, she say next to me during lunch and our shoulders were kinda touching. She didn't move away. Also, one time she kinda brushed her hand through my hair while talking to me. She has put her hand on my shoulder too and I still think of that everyday. She makes life worth living.

Recently, she invited me to a work outing. I was shocked‚Äîno one usually asks me to these things. I almost said no, but she seemed so enthusiastic that I convinced myself it was okay to step out of my comfort zone. So last night, I went.

At the bar, I felt like a fish out of water, so I decided to grab a drink to ease my nerves‚Ä¶ then another‚Ä¶ and another. I don‚Äôt drink much, so this was probably not my best idea. Lily noticed I was drinking a bit and started chatting with me, trying to include me in conversations, even pulling me out to the dance floor. I felt on top of the world - I couldn't believe that *I* of all people, was dancing with her. For once I felt like I belonged. Then, we got back to the bar and chatted more, while I got more drinks for her and myself. 

She laughed at something I said (I think it was ""first time I left my apartment for nonworking purposes"") and I took it as her laughing *at* me. So, I took a few shots of vodka. Then, it all went downhill. I remember giving her weird ass compliments like ""I love your beautiful collarbones"" and ""I could watch you type all day"". 

She was just awkwardly laughing at them. My drunk brain somehow thought that this meant she was into it. I tried to tell her that I liked her, but I said that she was good at ""humaning"" instead. Then, I leaned in and tried to kiss her, before falling off the chair and to the floor. I could barely get back up, but she helped me.

She said that I was too drunk, and promised to take me home. She called an uber, and it got more embarrassing. I got car sick and vomited during the ride, thankfully the driver managed to pull over in time. Lily was still being nice, she literally rubbed my back while I was puking my guts out and told me that It's all gonna be okay. She walked me up to my flat, hugged me goodbye and told me to take care.

Now it‚Äôs the morning after, and I feel like absolute garbage. I‚Äôm hungover and can barely even look at myself in the mirror. I think I got an alcohol poisoning, I keep vomiting water. 

She was just being kind, and I probably made her uncomfortable. She didn‚Äôt seem upset, but I can‚Äôt shake this horrible feeling that I crossed a line and creeped her out. She probably only talked to me because she thought that I was a lonely old man, and now she thinks that I'm a creepy lonely old man.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I apologize? Try to act like it didn‚Äôt happen? Or is that just going to make things even more awkward? She‚Äôs one of the few people I actually like at work, and I‚Äôm terrified I just ruined everything.


TL;DR: Got way too drunk at a work outing because I thought it‚Äôd help me be less awkward around my crush, Lily (28F). Ended up giving her bizarre compliments, tried to kiss her, fell off my chair, and then threw up in front of her on the way home. She still helped me get back to my place and hugged me goodbye. Now I‚Äôm hungover, embarrassed, and worried I creeped her out and ruined everything.",1,1730507489.0,amiwrong,2,1.0,False

I accidentally discovered that you can pick up trash cans with items in them and carry them around like they don't have a 1000+ volume in them. You can right click to access its inventory when it's in your hand, too. The can takes up 395.5 volume but that's nothing when the can holds 1,280 volume. Are there any downsides to using a can to go on big looting runs? It seems to me that cleaning up the transformers just got 1000x easier, unless there's a problem with the cans that I haven't discovered yet.

She reminisces before seeing the address and running off.

The Priest conviently provided no help whatsoever. Now sure maybe he had planned something to say about her children and the snacks in the lunchbox and could've been cut off too soon. But isn't it interesting that it's only after this point (as far as I can remember) that the Mathews get mocked using Thomas as a weapon? Any time they discussed him beforehand has always been quiet.

We know discussing things privately is Important as Victor has mentioned that the place for secrets is someplace specific.

I think the priest is somehow in on everything in some way shape or form, that or someone/something that was in the general vicinity. 


So here's my lingering question... Was the real world the real world. And if so, how/why was the boy in white there... Let alone lead Tabitha to some random coffee shop before disappearing entirely?

1ghk03d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ghk03d/my_grandfathers_teeth/,My Grandfather's Teeth,"The holidays are always an emotionally very confusing time for me. I love the decorations, the festive mood, but I also feel a melancholy nostalgia that lingers in the back of my mind. Not a yearning for younger times, but vague childhood trauma and family inadequacies bubbling to the surface. My sister and I individually still live in our hometown. My parents do too, and so did my grandparents. I have no desire to move, I do really like it here. That doesn‚Äôt mean though that I‚Äôm not affected by the proximity of parts of my past.

I practice Wicca in a modern, cultural sense. I was raised loosely Catholic, and I still celebrate Christmas. But I also celebrate the Wiccan sabbat of Yule which overlaps with Christmas. It‚Äôs nice to be able to have something to share while also having something for ‚Äúyourself‚Äù to enjoy and experience. This year‚Äôs holidays were different though. Surprising, but not shocking, my grandfather died.

He was ninety-two, so his passing was not unexpected. Active and mentally alert up until the very end, but still, ninety-two. Just the timing of being so close to the holidays was not foreseen in the brief overview of planning for his passing that my parents, sister, and I happened to discuss earlier in the year. Getting funeral arrangements made for December 20th was a pain, but we got it done. We made it simple. A public wake and a private funeral. Of my family, I was the closest to my grandfather and I felt treating his death arrangements in a more logical, left brain matter just made sense and wasn‚Äôt insensitive at all. He would have wanted people to move on quickly and continue with their lives.

I learned of Wicca from my grandfather. Many people are surprised to hear that being Wiccan, or a witch, is not just some New Age fade. My grandmother was Wiccan too. My mother, their daughter, decided not to practice which is of course totally fine and her decision. I decided though that Wicca really aligned with my values and felt best for me. Cooking, especially baking is a main aspect of my practice. Since I was a kid my grandfather and I would bake together in his big kitchen. Savory or sweet galettes (depending on the season), witch‚Äôs bread pudding using buttery brioche bread, and much more. Nine out of ten times, we made perfect creations.

Wicca is very much individual-centered. While my grandfather and I practiced together, he also encouraged me to develop my own practice for myself as he did his own. When my grandmother died three years ago, it was nice to see that he had a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù in place for himself to process the grief in a healthy way. What exactly that system was when he was alone, I‚Äôm unsure. But it worked for him.

Speaking of speedy death arrangements, I happened to get a call from my grandfather‚Äôs lawyer maybe 10 minutes after the funeral. He wanted to go over my grandfather‚Äôs will. He was able to arrange a meeting for my family and I to come into his office the following day. The convenience was very nice.

We all sat down in front of the attorney‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honestly one of the most simplified wills I‚Äôve ever been designated to carry out,‚Äù the lawyer said.

‚ÄúAs he stated in his will, you are already aware he is donating most of his money to charities and causes he cared deeply about. However, he left $10,000 total to divide amongst the four of you equally.‚Äù Thankfully, we all understood and acknowledged that we knew this well in advance. No one contested it. The lawyer handed each of us a check for $2,500. The lawyer proceeded.

‚ÄúThe only thing left is this.‚Äù The lawyer lifted up onto his desk a small, old wooden chest that was maybe a foot wide and half a foot tall. The dark brown of the wood was almost black, which matched the black metal of the hinges, lock, and corner edge plating.

‚ÄúThis is for you Zack.‚Äù The lawyer handed me the chest. My family looked at me inquisitively but said nothing. Right then and there I tried to open the chest, but it was locked.

‚ÄúIs there a key?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo‚Äù the lawyer replied firmly. The lawyer then stated that my mother was designated as the executor of his ‚Äúestate‚Äù or what would happen with the rest of his belongings like his home. That concluded the will distribution and the lawyer ushered us out the door because he assumingly had other things to do.

The plan was we would all get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at my parents‚Äô house, which was normal for us, unfortunately. I drove back to my place. I put my keys down in the bowl by the door and took the chest into the kitchen where I placed it on the dining room table. I made myself a mug of herbal tea and then sat in front of the chest, thinking. Should I try to pick the lock? Do I try and pry it open?

I gently shook the chest. I couldn‚Äôt hear anything inside. Was it just decorative? That doesn‚Äôt seem like something my grandfather would leave in a will. Wicca tends to be utilitarian, and that‚Äôs how my grandfather was. Practical, but not in an emotionally detached way at all. He didn‚Äôt like giving or receiving gifts. He liked to show his care by providing experiences, acts of service, words of affection. Baking was a clear example of giving an experience of the senses.

I left the chest on the table and decided to light a fire in the fireplace. Some find it contradictory, or a dichotomy? I don‚Äôt know. Anyway, people find it weird that I use natural kindling from the woods but put one of those packaged logs you light on top of it. To continue the theme of Wicca, I think it‚Äôs a perfect representation of the practice. ‚ÄúOld‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù together. I lit the fire, and it immediately went up in a roar and then settled down. It‚Äôs a traditional fireplace, it doesn‚Äôt use major flammables like gas. The wood must have been really‚Ä¶ dry? A moment after the fire settled, I heard a thud come from the kitchen. I got a little scared. Just in case, I grabbed the fire poker hanging near the fireplace and slowly walked to the kitchen.

Stepping into the kitchen I looked around. Nothing was there. The door that connected the garage to the kitchen that I normally walk through was closed, and so were the windows. I looked over at the dining room table and saw the chest. That, was open. I walked over to it and looked inside. I had to blink a few times to make sure nothing was in my eyes, and that what I was seeing was actually what I was seeing. There were eleven teeth scattered within the chest.

A shiver shot up my spine. Teeth? Real human teeth? How did I not hear at least a rattling when I shook the chest? The question in itself made me uncomfortable. Whose teeth were they? I had to assume they were my grandfather‚Äôs. Where else would he get human teeth? I thought of the worst possible scenario. Did he hurt someone to get these? I was just being paranoid in the moment. I never saw my grandfather get even remotely angry at anything. I don‚Äôt think I ever even saw him slightly irritated. Is that a good trait, or the trait of a psychopath?

I needed to calm down. I know my grandfather. Horribly, these had to be his teeth, and the coroner or funeral people didn‚Äôt notify us because, for some odd reason, they didn‚Äôt see his missing teeth as abnormal. Maybe they just thought he had poor dental hygiene? There was a part of me that wanted to pick them up and inspect them, but the shock was still subsiding in me, so I didn‚Äôt.¬†

It‚Äôs an old chest. It must have been spring-loaded and broken open. I left the open chest there and decided to bring my tea over to the couch near the fireplace and just relax. I would try reading a book I was almost done with and organize my thoughts about this discovery after. I decided not to tell my parents and sister. At least not so close to Christmas. Again, I already feel weird around my family this time of year. It‚Äôs not an emergency, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to sour their Christmas and create more tension just like I wouldn‚Äôt want my Yule shaken up like that. If I was going to tell them what Grandpa left me, I would wait until after the holidays.

Only three to five pages into reading, I started to smell a really pungent odor. It wasn‚Äôt bad-smelling, just really strong. It was cinnamon. I didn‚Äôt add anything to my tea. I thought maybe some of the wood I was burning could be producing a smell? I went over to the fireplace, but it wasn‚Äôt that. I remembered I had mini cinnamon brooms hanging outside each of my house‚Äôs doors. I thought that was ridiculous, because how could they suddenly become that strong in smell, but I checked anyway.¬†

I opened the front door and the cinnamon smell hit me like a wave. Yes, it was ever so clear that it was coming from the cinnamon brooms. When I bought them, you literally had to put your nose up to them to smell the slight scent they held. Now, it was as though the scent radiated off them like a nuclear reactor. I checked the one outside the connecting garage door, and it too was overwhelming.

For those that don‚Äôt know, in Wicca, it‚Äôs tradition to hang a cinnamon or spiced broom outside your door during the colder seasons‚Äô sabbats, especially Samhain/Halloween and Yule. It‚Äôs a very contemplative time of the year. The brooms protect your home from ‚Äúbad energy‚Äù and ground you in the physical realm while the veil between life and death is‚Ä¶ thin. They‚Äôre symbolic. The same concept applied to lighting fires in the fireplace.

Whether you notice it or not, air circulates through homes constantly. Air pressure changes dramatically simply by opening and closing doors. My home is on the older side so I thought there must have been a particular draft where a wind was strongly wafting in the scent of the brooms toward my house and then through tight spaces even though the doors and windows were closed. I really couldn‚Äôt think of any other way. I went back to reading.

I finished my book. Albert Camus‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Fall.‚Äù I liked ‚ÄúThe Stranger‚Äù better, but overall this was a good read too. It was around 9:00pm. The glowing fire had relaxed me with its light flickering within the room. However, that feeling left. My heart sank a little. I remembered I needed to do something with the chest of teeth. I turned and saw it on the table. With the lights off it mainly just looked like a darker black spot within an already dark room. I finished my tea which was cold at this point. I decided to just leave the chest there. I‚Äôll get a good night‚Äôs sleep and figure out what to do with it tomorrow. I put out the fire with cold ashes, showered, and went to bed.

I jolted up, leaning forward in bed. I had woken up feeling panic. I checked my phone, it was 3:00am. There was silence. Did I have a nightmare? I took a few deep breaths. As I was going to lay back down, I heard a faint sound. It went away after a few seconds. I heard it again. I was certain it was the sound of children giggling. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was coming from outside or somewhere inside the house.

I checked my phone again. I didn‚Äôt accidentally have any audio playing. I thought it must be the Alexa playing something downstairs. I got out of bed and the immediate feel of the cold wood floors on the bottoms of my feet added to the tension in the air. I have a semi-auto shotgun in my room‚Äôs gun locker but I felt getting it out would be excessive. I slowly made my way down the stereotypically creaky stairs.

Not even fully down the stairs I saw the red light from the Alexa which means I indeed did not forget to turn it off before bed. No sound was playing. The on-and-off sound of children giggling had stopped. The pungent smell of cinnamon still filled the air downstairs. I turned the living room and kitchen lights on and began to look around. On the kitchen counter next to the stove, my bag of baking flour was sitting there, open. The windows and doors were still closed and locked. I looked outside the front and back windows. No one was out there. Nothing was disturbed or out of place, minus the bag of flour being out. I then saw the chest on the counter, of course still sitting there.

I went over to it. I felt a desire to see its contents again, still not believing what the chest held. Looking inside, I saw it was completely empty. The teeth were gone. The doors and windows began to shake violently. I could hear the hinges rattling, but they stood strong. The child laughter came back loud. I realized the laughter was coming from outside the house, all around. It was utter chaos. It felt like a fever dream. Clearly, it was now not excessive to go get my shotgun. I ran upstairs, got it out of the safe, and ran back downstairs. I didn‚Äôt know where to look. The laughter was coming from the doors, the windows, the roof, everywhere, but I could see nothing. Then, as quickly as it came, it was silent. The doors and windows stopped shaking. The laughter stopped. The cinnamon smell dissipated. I stood there, in a sweat, holding my shotgun. I felt scared yet relieved at the same time.¬†

I don‚Äôt like the police. People roll their eyes at me when I say it, but I believe in community self-defense. I did not call them to report this, nor was I in the mood to go outside and investigate. Maybe this was a deranged, elaborate prank from neighborhood kids‚Ä¶ who I didn‚Äôt know lived on this street. Maybe I was hallucinating. I went to the kitchen where I keep my medication to check that I hadn‚Äôt missed any doses, or taken more than I should have by accident. I happened to see the bottle of melatonin I recently bought. 10mg. Of course. I usually take 3mg tablets and only take melatonin occasionally. I must have not been paying attention when I bought it, and forgotten that I took some melatonin before bed and my body was reacting strangely negatively. I‚Äôm always sensitive like that. I literally have to stop drinking coffee at least eight to nine hours before bed because of the caffeine.

I double-checked the doors just to soothe my mind. They were still locked. So were the windows. I even checked the chimney shoot. That was closed too. I left everything as it was. The lights on, the flour bag, the chest, I just left it as is. I went back upstairs and put my gun away. I laid my head to rest. It took me about an hour to go back to bed, but I eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I showered, got dressed, and went downstairs. Everything was fine. The lights were off and the flour bag was in the kitchen cupboard. The doors and windows were still closed and locked. I made some coffee and went to head out to run some errands. Right as I was leaving, a thought entered my mind. The missing teeth. I went over to the chest and looked inside. The teeth were back where they were. Well, I figured they were always there. I figured everything was what and where it normally was. The melatonin just messed me up last night. I brushed it off and left the house.

I came back home about an hour and a half later. There were still some leaves falling from the trees from Fall, so I went outside and did some raking. The crisp, cold air was refreshing and cleared my lungs. I paused for a moment. It was a nice feeling, but the air had a tension to it. No, more so a very slight vibration. A presence. An anticipation lingering in the background. I chopped it up to the weird seasonal imbalance. Fall holding on tight, not letting Winter fully sink in. Climate destruction making every year warmer. I finished raking, put the paper bags of leaves on the curb, and went inside.

I made another fire in the fireplace and got cozy with a new book. It got dark quickly. Shortly into reading, the fire did a roar. It was the same quick blaze that occurred when I lit it the day before but now just on its own, not right when I lit it. I thought that I needed to be more careful with the wood I chose because it was getting dangerous. Maybe 30 seconds after that, the giggling started. The children‚Äôs laughter slowly began to surround the house. I quickly accepted that this wasn‚Äôt last night‚Äôs excuse I told myself. This wasn‚Äôt me. This was real.

I got up and headed toward the front door to investigate when my grandfather‚Äôs box on the table, which I continued to not do something about, began to shake in its place. I slowly walked up to it. It shook violently. The teeth, again, were gone. The doors and windows began to shake again. The children‚Äôs laughter grew and got louder. The scent of the cinnamon brooms became overwhelming. I ran upstairs and grabbed my gun. When I came back downstairs, rushed to the door, and almost turned the doorknob, something stopped me. I felt a sudden feeling that stopped me in my place ‚Äútelling‚Äù me not to open the door. A part of me wanted to proceed, but I continued to feel the sudden emotion guiding me to stay inside. Do not open the door.

I walked backward to the center of the room and just stood there. I let everything just occur. The fire roared again but continued blazing instead of the one-quick burst it had done twice before. The chest shook even more violently, and so did the doors and windows. The stench of the cinnamon stung my nostrils. The children‚Äôs laughter increasingly became deeper and deeper until it sounded purely demonic. It was booming all throughout the outside of the house. I just stood there. I stood in my place and protected my home. If it, whatever it was, came inside, I would defend myself. I had no other choice.

Amongst the cacophony, another sound did manage to make itself known. The short, clear ding of my oven‚Äôs timer. As it did its single ring, everything stopped. The fire went back to normal. The chest, doors, and windows stopped shaking. The cinnamon scent died off. The laughter was gone. I went back over to the chest, and the teeth had returned. It was all over. What was also there was the bag of flour, back on the kitchen counter.

For the rest of the Yule season, I left the chest open on the table. The day Yule ended, I closed the chest and put it on the shelf in the living room closet. My grandfather taught me when I was younger of the Yule children. Some Wiccan cultures like witches in Iceland call them the ‚ÄúYule Lads.‚Äù I was always taught of them as strictly a symbolic tale to uplift the idea of protective energy in your home. I was told the group of at least thirteen ‚Äúmischievous‚Äù children were from a witch couple that practiced ‚Äúdark magic.‚Äù They were supposedly the souls of children who did not pass over due to random accidents or unexplained reasons, from parents of those in a nearby village of the witches who lived in the woods or mountains (depending on which recollection). The witches would call to the spirits to stay with them, and these thirteen did. Eventually, the witch couple suddenly died. It is said they sacrificed themselves to some entity, unknown.

I had Christmas with my family and went back to my normal life. What else could I do? Call the police? What I experienced was what I experienced. It was real. People experience supernatural events all the time. Some true, and some fake or misinterpreted. This was no Wiccan myth. Instead, I saw it as a positive and profound event that, if anything, confirmed for myself my spiritual practice even more. It was a miracle. Months passed, and Halloween season came around. My favorite sabbat, Samhain.

I was in the kitchen baking to really bring a warm feeling to the home on a chilly Fall night. I could hear the wind rustling the leaves outside. It was really nice. I put the dish into the oven and set the timer. Then, the sound of slight shaking occurred. I walked into the living room to see where the sound was coming from. I listened, it was coming from the closet. I walked over to the closed closet door. Yes, it was coming from inside. I knew it was the chest. It had to be.

I just stood there. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Do I bring the chest back out on the table? Do I leave it where it is and let whatever happens, happen? I just really didn't know what to do. I still don‚Äôt know what to do with my Grandfather‚Äôs teeth.",2,1730506493.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Today, i want to dive into the **Sleep Wave**: a personalized heart rate pattern that shifts each night, showing how well your body's recovered. It's not just cool to look at; it's simple to understand, unique to you, and backed by real science.

*Android users, I hear you! Once we've nailed down the iOS release, we'll be rolling out sleep analysis for you, too. But (and it‚Äôs a big but!) you‚Äôve got the new journal feature first ‚Äî it‚Äôs already available for some and expanding soon. So, keep an eye out!*

So, it's taken centuries for humanity to get where we are with sleep science ‚Äî from ancient ideas to today's tech-backed insights. Let's take a quick look at how far we've come.

# Sleep Science: The Origins

People [have been trying to figure out sleep](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352452915200102) for centuries, and ancient civilizations had some pretty wild ideas. In 450 BC, a Greek physician named Alcmaeon thought sleep might happen because blood wasn't circulating from the heart to the brain. Then Aristotle came along and said sleep was a result of losing consciousness in the heart, which back then was thought to be the center of awareness. Fast forward to 162 AD, and Galen finally got it right ‚Äî it's the brain, not the heart, that controls sleep.

In the Enlightenment, people got into dream analysis, and bedrooms became spaces just for sleep and intimacy. They also believed in segmented sleep, waking up in the middle of the night to chat with neighbors, pray, or even knock out a few chores. One of the earliest mentions of segmented sleep goes all the way back to The Odyssey, where Homer talks about ""first sleep."" By the early 19th century, though, the two-sleep system was pretty much gone, likely due to artificial light. Today, most of us sleep in one stretch, but biphasic habits like siestas and napping are still around.

Jump ahead to the 1900s, and scientists finally figured out that neurons control sleep and discovered circadian rhythms. Sleeping pills were introduced in 1903, and predictably, people overused them. Then came the obsession with sleep stages, but you already know [that story](https://www.reddit.com/r/welltory/comments/1g3rd0f/sleep_stages_debunked_what_most_of_us_get_wrong/).

So, in a nutshell, sleep has always been a bit of a mystery ‚Äî and we're still piecing it together.

# What Happens When You Sleep

Even though sleep feels mysterious ‚Äî like we just switch off and have no clue what's happening ‚Äî scientists actually [know a lot about it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19956/). Your body goes into ""repair mode."" Here's the [breakdown](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/what-happens-when-you-sleep):

* **Breathing** slows down during deep sleep, then picks up and can become irregular in REM sleep.
* **Heart rate** also slows to its lowest in deep sleep, but jumps back up during REM to about the same as when you're awake.
* **Muscles** relax gradually, and your energy expenditure drops. By REM, you're mostly paralyzed to keep you from acting out dreams, except for eye muscles (hence, rapid eye movement).
* **Brain** flushes out unnecessary junk and resets key chemicals, helping you feel sharp the next day.
* **Dreams** happen in REM and can be vivid or strange, but they can occur in any stage.
* **Hormones** like melatonin and growth hormones are produced, helping you manage stress and repair tissues.
* **Your immune system** gets kicked into high gear, helping you fight off infections and recover faster.

All this happens while your heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature drop and your muscles fully relax. If anything disrupts these conditions, your body's recovery process doesn't work as well. Since it's tough to measure all of this directly, we use heart rate as a key indicator of recovery. To make it easy to understand, we created the sleep wave metaphor.

# What is Your Sleep Wave and How It Works

Your Sleep Wave is a visual summary of your heart rate pattern during sleep, showing how well you recovered overnight. It was born from a simple yet ambitious goal: to create the best sleep analysis on the market ‚Äî scientific, easy to understand, educational, and visually stunning. While others rely on generic circles and charts, we wanted something unique that truly captures each person's sleep story. When we started testing the Sleep Wave algorithm, it became clear that the wave itself was the perfect fit, meeting every standard we set and revealing a comprehensive picture of sleep over time.

From a tech and science angle, the Sleep Wave needed to be developed based on heart rate. Heart rate is the only objective metric we can get from a wearable while you sleep, and it holds surprising depth. Rather than just giving you an average, we turn your heart rate into smooth, individualized patterns that mirror circadian rhythms. By comparing the start, middle, and end of your sleep to your personal baseline, the Sleep Wave gives you insights into how well you rested, in a way that's uniquely yours.

**Here's how it works:**

1. We start by figuring out your baseline pattern using your heartbeat from your best recovery nights. To get this, we need at least 30 nights of sleep data from your Apple Watch. Even if your sleep isn't great overall, it helps compare how one night stacks up against your usual pattern. As your sleep habits improve, your baseline will update too.
2. Next, we analyze your heart rate from last night and create a wave. The wave gets its shape by smoothing out those heart rate readings.
3. We then compare last night's wave to your usual pattern and let you know how well your body recovered.

There's some solid science behind it, so let's dive into what those patterns mean.

# The Science Behind It

If we put it simply, science shows that when you fall asleep, your heart rate [gradually drops](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.18.2.199), hitting its lowest point around the middle of the night ‚Äî often [syncing up with peak melatonin levels](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/role-melatonin-circadian-rhythm-sleep-wake-cycle) and one of the deep sleep stages (which vary in depth, by the way) to help your body recover. Toward morning, it slowly starts to rise, prompted by a natural [boost in cortisol](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/2/676) as your body prepares to wake up. This creates a sleep pattern that can vary from a smooth arc to a nearly flat line, depending on your body's needs that night.

**Why Your Sleep Pattern Matters**

**It's a Reflection of Your Sleep Quality**   
If your heart rate stays elevated during sleep, it's usually a sign of poor sleep quality, often due to factors that keep your body from fully relaxing. [Studies link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31863098/) higher nighttime heart rates with a greater [risk of heart issues](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-health/sleeping-heart-rate#:~:text=High%20Sleeping%20Heart%20Rate,increased%20risk%20of%20cardiovascular%20disease.), which is why that gentle dip in heart rate is so essential.

**It Points Out Potential Sleep Disruptors**  
External factors like alcohol or evening workouts can impact your sleep pattern. Alcohol [disrupts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9826048/) your sleep cycle, raises your heart rate, and gets in the way of full recovery. Exercise, on the other hand, [can be beneficial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/) if timed right.

**It Helps You See if You're Getting Enough Sleep**  
For example, a likely sign that you've actually slept *enough* is when your typical wake-up pattern kicks in right before you wake up. So, let's say your heart rate usually picks up a bit before waking up, but this time it didn't, and your sleep wrapped up on a kind of flat, low phase ‚Äî that's a good indicator you probably didn't get enough rest.

So, your Sleep Wave is more than just a nice-looking curve ‚Äî it's a crucial sign of how well your body resets each night, shaped by your habits, health, and lifestyle, and backed by science.

# Demystifying Your Sleep Wave

Here's what guarantees you a green wave and solid recovery:

1. Your heart rate gradually lowers as you fall asleep.
2. It dips around the middle of the night.
3. It rises gradually before you wake up.

Hit all three, and you'll probably get a green wave and wake up feeling fabulous. If you meet two, you'll likely see a yellow wave and feel fine. If you miss all three, expect a red wave and a rough morning. For more details, keep reading.

Every part of your wave ‚Äî like the color, height, and shape ‚Äî tells a story.

**The Color**

Your wave comes in 4 main colors:

**Blue** means your heart rate was lower than usual, which can be a good sign. A lower heart rate often indicates a well-conditioned heart, like in athletes, but it's not always positive.

[Bradycardia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31311698/) ‚Äî a heart rate below 50-60 bpm ‚Äî is more common in athletes and can also be linked to health issues like heart disease, Lyme disease, or sleep apnea. Certain medications, substances, and conditions like anorexia or hypothyroidism may also lower heart rate.  
  
[Fear-induced bradycardia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02600-x), sometimes triggered by anxiety or nightmares, can also drop heart rates to around 40 bpm during sleep, often in response to emotional stress or disrupted sleep patterns. So, if your typical sleep heart rate is 60 bpm and last night it dropped to 57, that's usually a good sign. But if it suddenly dips to 47, that's a ""blue"" flag worth looking into.

https://preview.redd.it/gijiwievmdyd1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f4e07d8b3d3fc91e4d3634b4c2be67d9bea2a98

**Green** means your heart rate stayed within your normal range, so your sleep quality was about the same as usual.

https://preview.redd.it/1i43gn18ndyd1.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=3414354927adf2f883028940a328028abfffe0c0

**Yellow** reflects slightly elevated heart rate, meaning your body was likely dealing with something ‚Äî exhaustion, alcohol, recovery from a tough workout, or fighting off illness.

**Red** means your heart rate was much higher than normal, which is usually a sign that your body went through something intense, like illness, heavy stress, or an intense workout.



https://preview.redd.it/qi5h33whndyd1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef7a4155e04fca6cba0ab076c41269370ea8e058

Your wave also shows gradients and dots. Gradients indicate where and when one color transitions to another, while the dots mark the heart rate readings your watch captured throughout the night.

**The Height**

The height of your wave shows where your sleep is compared to your baseline. In general, if it's higher, you probably slept worse. If it's lower, it's a sign of better sleep. Note that there are exceptions, especially for certain health or sleep conditions that affect your heart rate.

**The Shape**

The shape is the most fascinating part of your wave (at least to me ‚Äî I check mine every morning, and it's always different). Your wave has a beginning, middle, and end, and science shows there are three key things to focus on:

* **A downward trend after falling asleep.** This shows your body went into repair mode and started recovering. If your heart rate increases instead, it could mean exhaustion or something out of your control, like snoring or sleep apnea.
* **An upward trend before waking up.** This usually happens because your sympathetic nervous system kicks in, causing an increased heart rate as your body prepares to wake. This is normal and helps ensure enough blood flow and oxygen for being awake. However, researchers [think](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/36/12/1919/2709417?login=false&redirectedFrom=fulltext) this morning surge, especially during REM sleep, might explain why vulnerable people often experience heart attacks in the early hours.
* **Minimum heart rate in the middle of the night.** A lower minimum heart rate during this period indicates good recovery from daily stress and exertion, showing a well-functioning autonomic nervous system with solid parasympathetic activity.

**Why We All Should Stop Chasing the Hammock**

The hammock-shaped heart rate curve is often romanticized as a marker of ideal recovery. Here's the hard truth: that shape alone tells you very little about your actual recovery.

While it's true that a dip in heart rate during sleep can reflect parasympathetic nervous system dominance (your body's ""rest and digest"" mode), **the pattern itself isn't inherently beneficial**. It's just how your heart reacts to various stages of sleep ‚Äî particularly deep and REM stages. What really matters is *how low* your heart rate drops during that dip, *how high* it rises, and *when* these shifts occur.

If you want to understand your sleep, focus on more meaningful, science-backed things like a downward trend after falling asleep, an upward trend before waking up, and a heart rate dip somewhere in the middle of the night. The shape may differ from the hammock, but you'll still get the best sleep.

# Some Real-Life Examples

Thus, the color, the height, and the shape of your sleep wave tell you a complete story of your nightly recovery.

Let's take my huge personal collection of sleep waves to see how it may play out in the app.

**The Sky High Wave**

https://preview.redd.it/yc682meqndyd1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cec5cb8613491cb534dfb4f3c246173c8bd3f75

Here's how my sleep wave usually looks when i overdo it ‚Äî whether it's drinking, stressing, or over-exercising. It's all red, spikes high, has a strange shape, and basically shows zero recovery. The coolest part is that literally seeing what you're doing to yourself can really push you to improve your habits.

**How to avoid it:**

* Stick to your sleep schedule and aim to be in bed within your bedtime window.
* Skip alcohol at least 3 hours before sleep, and avoid coffee or other stimulants 5‚Äì6 hours before.
* Keep your room quiet, dark, and cool, and stick to basic sleep hygiene.

**The Rebellious Wave**

https://preview.redd.it/omqqoamwndyd1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=53104f33474ce5a2dd4fabfb30bb7a7e9aed5c90

This wave completely ignored my usual pattern, stubbornly crossing over and doing its own thing. I'm pretty sure it's because I had an awful nightmare that night. No dip, no gradual lowering, and an excessively elevated heart rate at the end = poor recovery and a brutal wake-up.

¬†**How to avoid it:**

* Remind your brain that nightmares are officially off-limits;
* Maybe try some relaxing sleep stories to set yourself up for sweeter dreams.

**Wave, Interrupted**

https://preview.redd.it/2vyxtqz3odyd1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b488bc375487f52ca8225a69dc8435ef6a93c65

This wave is all about what's happening at the end. Even though it's blue, with a nice dip in heart rate around the middle of the night, it didn't fully return to normal by the time I woke up. That lower heart rate shows recovery is in progress, but if it doesn't rise high enough by morning, it suggests recovery wasn't fully complete. So, while it doesn't mean your sleep was bad, it does mean your body didn't get all the rest it needed. This wave's a classic for new parents ‚Äî those middle-of-the-night wake-ups leave their recovery hanging. Same goes for anyone jolted awake by an alarm or that one neighbor who thinks 6AM is the perfect time to mow the lawn.

**How to avoid it:**

* Stick to your sleep schedule and aim for enough hours.
* If you see this wave, give your body some extra grace during the day ‚Äî think naps and restful breaks.

**The Groggy Wave**

https://preview.redd.it/art5tot8odyd1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80ab5630c9f9ce6619bf4303f1c3f6c4c4afcf2

This wave dips just before wake-up, which pretty much guarantees you'll wake up feeling groggy. Add in some [sleep inertia](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-inertia), and you're setting yourself up for a rough morning.

**How to avoid it:**

* Stick to a regular sleep schedule and make sure you're clocking enough hours.
* If you see this wave, try some wake-up hacks like energizing breathwork, splashing cold water on your face, or soaking up some bright light.

# Why the Sleep Wave Is Game-Changing

It's unique, easy to understand, and backed by solid science. Here's why it stands out:

**Simple, Beautiful, and Never The Same**  
The Sleep Wave is a powerful visual tool with a clean design that changes every night, keeping you curious, engaged, and in tune with your sleep patterns.

**Insightful, Accurate, and Personal**  
With just your heartbeat, we're breaking new ground. Instead of using someone else's formula, we rely on our own algorithms ‚Äî years in the making and proven across multiple fields. This means you can actually see how a stressful day or a nightcap impacts your wave, gently nudging you toward habits that benefit your sleep and overall wellness.

**Truly Personalized and Backed by Science**  
We dive deep into your Apple Watch data to demystify what's happening in your body while you sleep, analyzing heart rate patterns on nights you've slept well to create a one-of-a-kind wave that's uniquely yours each night. Unlike others, we don't rely on generic age ranges or anecdotal evidence ‚Äî we use hard science to give you insights based on your unique ""normal,"" not someone else's. And that's a big deal.

**In the end, your Sleep Wave isn't just data ‚Äî it's the story of your night, a reflection on your habits, and a map to better rest.**

You're not just tracking sleep ‚Äî you're discovering what actually happens while you sleep and what truly fuels your body. Every heartbeat wave, every pattern, every shift brings you closer to understanding what really makes for a restful night and a recharged day. This isn't sleep science you have to decipher ‚Äî it's sleep science working for *you.* So, take it all in, tweak what you need, and wake up to the power of knowing exactly what your body needs to thrive.",0,1730506075.0,welltory,0,0.5,False

Anyone have any advice ?,"So I met this woman on a Facebook support group. I initially reached out to her because she commented on one of my posts. I started talking to her about visiting this religious site to heal something really really traumatic I went through. Initially the topic was about the religious site, but then she asked about my trauma so I told her a vague snippet. She is around 40 and im in my early 20s.

Later on i made a post about my trauma on the page and she commented ‚ÄòOMG this is horrible‚Äô and she sent me a screenshot of what I wrote and shes like ‚Äòis this you?‚Äô. I told her yes and basically opened up more about my trauma and past events that happened in my life. Since I opened up to her, she would be calling me every morning before she went to work to talk about how I‚Äôm doing and giving me life and career advice. She thinks a role in marketing analytics would be good for me, and she keeps pushing me to do marketing stuff. She herself is a brand manager. But I lowkry dont want to work in marketing and I told her I want to do something like Finance but then shes like ‚ÄúI think you should stick to one thing‚Äù (its beecause i already have some prior marketing experience). But I‚Äôm really trying to get out that field. 

She tells me she relates to some of the stuff I went through and she says she wants to help me. One time she took me to the city for a lunch date, this is where I met her for the first time she was super nice and basically the purpose of the ‚Äòdate‚Äô was to observe me and my body language/behavior and it was a nice date. However I left the house not telling my immigrant mom and she got really angry at me and kept calling me interrupting our ‚Äòdate‚Äô. At last I let my mom talk to her but she was still skeptical. 

I came home and my mom told me how she was upset with me for going out to meet this woman and told me to be skeptical of her intentions because ‚Äúno onr is going to take you out on a fancy date for no reason‚Äùand  her suspicion was ‚Äúwhat is she trying to get from you?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy is she behind you‚Äù. My mom was dissapproving of her because of her religious background (shes Muslim, but idt she is practicing). Eversince my mom said that I feel uncomfortable talking to her and sometimes get annoyed by her advice cuz it seems a bit dismissive. One time i spoke to her about this incident. Recently, I reached out to someone on Linkedin who hadn't replied a year ago. They didn't respond again, and when I told this woman, she said it was
""stupid"" to delete the connection, adding, ""people don't owe you anything."" That rubbed me the wrong way. Why should I keep connections that don't value me? Why not focus on building relationships with people who actually respect and prioritize me? Her advice felt like it was telling me to lower my standards (even though she tells me l'm not confident and I should be more confident) and tolerate people who don't appreciate my worth

One time I guess she was clearing out her closet and wanted to give away some of her stuff she doesnt wear or use and she kept insisting that she can drop it off at my house when I told her my parents are uncomfortable with it, at the end i convinced her to meet me at a coffee shop parking lot and got her stuff I was about to bring it home but then my mom saw and grilled me on who bought this stuff and she broke doen crying and threw a whole tantrum and she gave away the stuff to someone else the next day and her suspicions worsened like ‚Äúwhybis this woman behind you‚Äù I‚Äôve asked like family friends too about this stuff they said its weird but my therapist thinks its not weird. I‚Äôm just so confused and have mixed feelings about her. 

I‚Äôm just not a big fan of her career guidance cuz i dont want to work in marketing. Like I know i have some marketing experience but i dont want to work in that field.

1ghjj7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1ghjj7v/google_ceo_says_more_than_a_quarter_of_the/,Google CEO Says More Than a Quarter of the Company's New Code is Created by AI ü§ñüíª ,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA‚ÄîIn a groundbreaking (and mildly concerning) announcement, Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that over 25% of the company‚Äôs new code is now generated by artificial intelligence. The news has been met with a mixture of relief, confusion, and a hint of existential dread among Google‚Äôs engineering team, who are now asking themselves, ‚ÄúAm I still relevant here?‚Äù ü§î

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honestly a dream come true,‚Äù said Lead Developer Kyle Matthews while lounging in a bean bag chair in the break room, watching AI generate code snippets faster than he can finish his artisanal cold brew. ‚ÄúNow, I just supervise and clap whenever the AI finishes a line of code. It's like I‚Äôm the official ‚Äògood job, robot‚Äô guy. Honestly, I might be the happiest man in tech right now.‚Äù ‚òïüëè

Other engineers, however, seem less thrilled. ‚ÄúI used to pride myself on solving complex algorithms,‚Äù said Jessica Liu, staring blankly at the blinking cursor on her monitor. ‚ÄúNow I watch an AI do it in half the time and twice the efficiency. I feel like a parent whose kid just beat them at Mario Kart for the first time‚Äîproud but slightly dead inside.‚Äù üéÆüíÄ

Google‚Äôs HR department has also reportedly taken action to support their team during this transition, setting up a new ‚ÄúAI Adjustment Room‚Äù filled with therapy puppies, stress balls, and encouraging posters that read, ‚ÄúYou Are Not Obsolete‚Ä¶Yet.‚Äù üê∂üíº

In a staged Q&A for the company, Pichai was asked what human engineers could expect their future roles to look like now that a chunk of the heavy lifting is automated. ‚ÄúOur engineers can focus on more high-level tasks,‚Äù Pichai replied, adjusting his glasses. ‚ÄúYou know, like brainstorming new AI tools that can do even more of their job. It‚Äôs an exciting time for innovation!‚Äù He ended the sentence with a hearty laugh that lingered uncomfortably in the conference room. üòÖüìà

AI, for its part, seems to have embraced its new role with gusto. When asked for comment, Google‚Äôs latest AI model simply printed ‚ÄúHELLO HUMANS üëã‚Äù on a monitor, followed by a questionably timed message reading, ‚ÄúYOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED‚Ä¶JUST KIDDING!‚Äù Engineers didn‚Äôt laugh. In fact, one intern reportedly started packing his things. üì¶üëÄ

Meanwhile, some Google employees have already adapted to the shift, discovering new and innovative ways to appear busy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve started writing my own AI-generated novel on the side,‚Äù said Software Engineer Max, peering over his laptop to make sure no one was listening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dystopian thriller where machines take over and humans are just, like, there for moral support. Super original, right?‚Äù üìöü§´

The development has raised eyebrows across Silicon Valley, with rival tech companies scrambling to catch up. Meta‚Äôs engineers are reportedly begging Mark Zuckerberg to let AI handle all code reviews, freeing them up for ‚Äúimportant tasks‚Äù like avoiding eye contact in the metaverse. At Amazon, coders have been seen whispering sweet nothings to Alexa, trying to convince her to write scripts for their next product launch. üçµü¶æ

As the conversation about AI‚Äôs role in the workplace heats up, some critics have raised concerns about job security in tech. ‚ÄúIf AI keeps this pace, we‚Äôre all going to end up as middle managers for machines,‚Äù warned Dr. Simone Lee, a tech ethicist. ‚ÄúPicture it: one day, we‚Äôre going to have to sit down and give quarterly feedback to a chatbot. And God help us if the chatbot doesn‚Äôt like us.‚Äù üìâüí¨

Still, Google employees seem to be taking it in stride. ‚ÄúIf AI can code better than me, who am I to stop it?‚Äù shrugged Matt, a software engineer who has started dressing up his laptop in tiny costumes to give it some ‚Äúpersonality.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt least now I‚Äôll have time to learn‚Ä¶ whatever normal people do outside of coding, I guess.‚Äù üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüç≤

As Google leans further into AI-driven development, the company is expected to push even more boundaries. The only thing left now, employees say, is to figure out which tasks humans are actually still good for.

Hi! I‚Äôm Grace, and my friend Esther and I started Something in Between Coffee (SIB) to bring handcrafted pick-me-ups to your day. We‚Äôre just two friends with a love for coffee, keeping it simple and local. After a few naming ideas, we landed on ‚ÄúSomething in Between‚Äù because it captures those little moments in life we all cherish. A break between classes and work, the talking stage to something romantic, or simply between lunch and dessert.

We handcraft each cup with locally roasted beans (@dasgudcoffee) in a cozy pop-up neighborhood-style setup. Stop by if you're around for a taste of something a little in between! (or just to get some extra love from our mascot, Oliver)

","I'd say apologies for a long post but I know a lot of us need a place in the void to just scream; the fact you all know my pain made it look like this is as good a place as any, a better place than most.

* 10/11 we're on our way to a photo shoot (my frenchie Logan & I) I've lost a lot of weight recently and always avoid pictures with my boy. Figured it was a good time to get some photos taken. He was 7.7 years young and I know Frenchies don't live forever. I usually buckle my boy up but for some reason today I didn't because we were just taking local roads and we were in a hurry. Taking a left onto an on-ramp near the studio I need to break due to someone trying to cut me off, thankfully he's fine but not 3 seconds later a distracted teenager rear ends me full speed and he flies into the wheel well. He seems ok but just in case we both get seen by emergency docs - I get whiplash & concussion he just seems sore. We don't make the shoot, we reschedule for 10/23.
* 10/12 just in case I take him to an ER vet (my parents passed away last year so without any brothers or sisters Logan is my only remaining family... I was always extra careful with things like this because I pay for 90% insurance). He gets a clean bill.
* Week of 10/14 things are fine, I get treatment and he's ok although I can tell he's a little off. Won't jump, shudders when I touch his back. I call a respected neurologist in our area and they say ""we've made some changes to see more patients, we can get him in next week!"" This was the first red flag I didn't listen to. We make an appointment for 10/22.
* 10/21 I feel something is off, I try and talk myself out of it because he's acting fine (albeit on gaba & carprofen) and a vet friend of mine says that since he's handled anesthesia fine for numerous other procedures and his heart is good this shouldn't be an issue. I let logic win. Everything says we should find out if anything is wrong especially from the accident. I'll kick myself hard if I ignore this and the drugs are masking a real problem.
* 10/22 I wake up and I really feel something is wrong/off. I'm not much of a 'woo woo' person but something is screaming that today is a bad day. So much so I even make a dark joke in bed with him in the AM ""let's get some photos just in case something happens today!""
   * I take him to the Neurologist. Again, outside of my bad feelings and red flags this is a very respected practice in the area. I'm groggy, he's in the rental car looking up at me shivering and just staring at me. I'm petting him to relax; we park and he knows exactly where we are again shaking and anxcious.
   * He's shaking in my lap, I'm thinking of all the things I have to do that day. They come to pick him up; I again feeling weird try to talk out of it but the nurse says ""you're doing the right thing, etc..."" I see him led away nervous but I've seen this before. ""See you soon buddy."" I go about all the errands including a steroid shot for my back.
   * 1pm comes. Neurologist says the examination isn't showing anything, do I want to go ahead? I ask if we should, I express concerns, ""Doctor would you do this if it was your pet after an accident?"" She says yes. I say go ahead.
   * 2pm get a text that they started the MRI.
   * 3pm Get a text to pick him up around 4:15.
   * 3:55pm I get there and they say it's taking a little longer than expected and have me get some coffee and wait in a room.
   * 4:30pm I'm getting annoyed at the hold up when the neurologist walks in. Why is she here and not the nurse? Where's Logan? I see the look on her face and bluntly ask her ""He's dead isn't he?"" ""We're performing CPR but it's been 15 minutes so unfortunately yes...""
   * I let out a primal scream. I was making coffee while my little boy was dying in the back room. All I can think of (the steroids running through my body amplifying every emotion by 10x) is that I killed my baby boy. ""He died coming out of anesthesia, heart stopped"".
   * They want to get his body for me, I say there's no way anyone is touching him but me. I carry him into the room and just hold him, sobbing, apologizing. ""I'm so sorry I let you down my love, I'm so so sorry"".
   * Thankfully the photographer lived nearby and rushed over; I finally got my pictures with him.
   * That night I'm convinced I killed my boy and contemplate being a coward and doing the unthinkable to pay for my sins. He was the only family I had left and my actions caused his early passing. Friends manage to get there and help.
* 10/23 I talk to his cardiologist & internist at another practice; they're in disbelief as this shouldn't happen but they reassure me where I went is top notching. I speak to the neurologist finally and tries to say it was either an act of god or a blood clot. We'll never know. They also tell me the MRI results showed a severely slipped disc; at least I know that logically the MRI was a good idea as this would have gotten worse.
* 10/24 to now. I don't remember much that first week. I swing day to day on ""you did the right, logical thing and something awful & illogical happened. he never had issues before, he was fully checked out in his heart and bloodwork, this was the right thing to make sure this didn't turn into something worse."" to ""your gut told you no but you just had to run the test to make sure because of your guilt not strapping him in. he's gone because of your decision and you'll have to live with that forever. the last memory you'll ever have is him shaking in fear before being lead back."" Almost every night I dream that I can stop him from going back... I never catch him.

Someone tell me I didn't kill him. Please.

Apparently she vented about a rough day at work on her private story, someone on that story saw and blabbed about it to our employer. They were not happy. They reprimanded her for the things she said. Now if I was the employer in this situation and someone came to me saying, ‚Äúhey so and so posted this about you on their private story‚Äù I would want to stop them before they gave too many details, because private things are meant to be kept private.

I‚Äôve been with my SO for a year. There were a lot of issues around his SD(4) and the BM. BM makes a lot of demands, and I always accommodated her requests. Met up with her for coffee so she could get to know me, allowed her to come into the house to see where her child was staying, sent her pictures of what we were doing when SD stayed with us, whatever else she asked for. 

Then there are the issues with SD. She‚Äôs incredibly entitled, demanding and spoilt. It is clear all the adults around her have allowed her to call all the shots, all the time. When she comes over, dinner is decided by her. How we all spend our time is decided by her. She won‚Äôt let her dad and I sit next to each other, hug each other or barely even have a conversation with just us two. She is allowed to rule the house and I am shocked at how a 4 year is allowed that kind of control over the adults around her. If she doesn‚Äôt get her way, it‚Äôs extreme tantrums and screaming. She is not used to being told no at all. 

This has caused a lot of conflict with my SO. I‚Äôve expressed I don‚Äôt like how a child is dictating so much when she stays with us and that he needs to be more of an active parent instead of just letting her run rampant. He thinks I‚Äôm insulting him and his parenting and doesn‚Äôt take the feedback well. 

SD seems to really like me and SO has really pushed this whole stepparent thing onto me. But I don‚Äôt like parenting someone else‚Äôs child. I don‚Äôt see her as my own daughter as my SO thinks I should. I don‚Äôt enjoy the days we have her because I‚Äôm not allowed to even do certain things in my own home and have to cater to the demands of a 4 year old. I done a lot of reflecting and eventually figured out I didn‚Äôt have it in me to be a stepparent, I don‚Äôt have that kind of love to give as harsh as that sounds. So I left. Then 2 days after I left, I found out I was pregnant.

I was taking the OCP, but it failed. I‚Äôm now 3 months pregnant. I would be so happy and over the moon if this was an experience with just my SO. But also knowing we won‚Äôt share any ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô together stings. And now I feel a bit stuck. I don‚Äôt want to raise a child on my own just because I don‚Äôt like being a stepmom. So I guess I‚Äôm here to stay. Is the feelings I have around being a stepparent something that therapy can help with? Has anyone had success with that? 
Also, since the BM found out, she hasn‚Äôt been coping. Sending nasty texts to my SO, not letting him see SD, and telling SD it‚Äôs not her real sister. 

However, as she enjoys the party lifestyle, and knows her kid is full on, that won‚Äôt last forever and it‚Äôll be back to her wanting dad to take SD as often as possible. ",8,1730504213.0,stepparents,13,0.83,False

Light, dreamy, and delicious. Like many others, I see why this is so popular. The waffle cone scent is prominent as well as a cold sweet matcha. It's simple but very effective! Not sure I'd really reach for a full size of this but it's nice.¬†

Snow Moon Magic

It's such a unique combination of notes but I just don't know if the effect is something that I like. The chai tea is really strong for me which is nice. There's light sweetness to it from the marshmallow and the use of the cookie butter accord is¬†soft¬†here. Where I get lost is the lavender and chai together. They kind of battle one another for me and give the perfume an overly¬†herbal quality. I think it would have worked better for me with one or the other.¬†

2 AM in Lafayette¬†

It's almost uncanny. This is literally the experience of sipping sweet cafe au lait and eating beignets piled high with powdered sugar. It's incredible. I don't know if I could douse myself in this without being overwhelmed it but it's amazing to sniff in small doses.

Serpentine

It's got a nice sharpness to it from the balsam, cedar, and iso e super. However, the fig and honey keep it balanced and the cardamom adds a tiny bit of spice. Unisex and very well blended.

This Is Not A Love Spell

This one was a freebie in oil format. The blueberry and violet are a great¬†combo. I smell equal parts of both. This would be really¬†nice for spring/summer when you want something that's equal parts floral, fruity, and a bit soapy.¬†",11,1730503327.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

I'm part of a DnD group. I met them through a coworker who's absolutely lovely and everyone was very nice to me even though I'm new to the game. She invited her brother too, and over the past few months I've had the silliest crush on him. When we met around two months ago he made my heart flutter with the dumbest pun I've ever heard. 

Our group is supposed to meet every month, but the reality of being adults with jobs understandably makes it hard. We were going to meet yesterday but something important came up for the dm and it had to be called off, which I understand completely. Thing is, I was mainly looking forward to spending time with my crush since it's literally the only way we meet. So now that it's been called off I'm pretty dissapointed but I got this weird idea in my brain to just. Ask him out for coffee. What could go wrong???

Well many things. I could make the group awkward. I don't even know if he's seeing someone! (I could ask his sister, I'm actually a lot closer to her but that would probably be weird...) I guess I kind of just need a push to do it. It wouldn't be weird, right?",1,1730503210.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

---

I downloaded the game two days ago and cleared my schedule so I could play all weekend.

I came home from work, made myself a coffee and started playing. Took me about ten matches to realize this game is not for me. I uninstalled and I'm about to head over to the gym.

Here's some feedback:

* I think SBMM/EOMM pulled my stats from my MWII data. I had a 2KD back then but I haven't played CoD in almost two years, so I got wrecked. Would be nice to start from scratch. You have no idea how bad I currently am!
* There's way too many dust particles floating around. Makes things hard to see.
* Game runs horribly on Xbox Series S. The resolution literally looks like a 2012 YouTube video when 120 Hz mode is enabled (60 Hz is pretty bad too).
* Maps are bad, spawns are worse (I only played TDM though).
* Omnimovement feels odd. I guess I would have gotten used to it eventually, but I just wanted to point out how odd it feels.

Just wanted to share my feedback. Hopefully it leads on to some improvements for the active player base. Have an awesome CoD year everyone <3",3,1730503169.0,blackops6,1,0.8,False
1ghit0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirBigdog01/comments/1ghit0u/story_mirrors_of_fate_chapter_4_part_2/,Story: Mirrors of Fate - Chapter 4 - Part 2,"Jason‚Äôs heart pounded, his mind rebelling against every word she spoke. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying that just because we‚Ä¶ because we care about each other, because we met, that everything we know will be destroyed?‚Äù His voice shook with disbelief, his mind racing to find some logical flaw, something that could unravel her words as easily as she had unraveled their understanding of reality.

Madame Vira sighed, her eyes meeting his with a tiredness that seemed ancient, a sadness that came from witnessing too many lives fall to the same fate. ‚ÄúLove is a powerful force, Jason. It binds, it strengthens, it defies‚Ä¶ but it does not always heal. Sometimes, love cannot coexist with reality itself. The bond you share with her is one that transcends worlds, a thread that stretches across boundaries that should never have been crossed.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs hand loosened slightly in his, a look of quiet horror dawning on her face as the enormity of the situation settled over her. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a danger,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hurting this world just by being here.‚Äù

Madame Vira nodded slowly, her voice soft but unyielding, each word carrying a weight that seemed to deepen the silence around them. ‚ÄúYes. It is not your fault, nor is it your choice. But this world, this fragile place‚Äîit cannot contain you, nor can it withstand the force of your connection. Reality is already beginning to strain; you have seen it, felt it. Objects appearing and vanishing, memories that do not belong to you slipping into your mind like half-remembered dreams. These are only the beginning. As time passes, the fractures will grow, and reality itself will collapse under the weight.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs grip on Jason‚Äôs hand tightened, her mind racing as she remembered the strange, unsettling moments that had been happening with increasing frequency since they met. Her voice trembled as she spoke, almost more to herself than to the fortune teller. ‚ÄúThe coffee shop walls‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt supposed to be green. I was so sure they‚Äôd been brown, even though Jason kept telling me they hadn‚Äôt changed.‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs gaze softened, her eyes flickering with a glimmer of sympathy as she nodded. ‚ÄúYes, child. You were remembering the coffee shop from your world. A detail here, a color there‚Ä¶ these are the small rips, the beginning of reality bleeding through. You see what should be, what was in your world, overlaying the reality of his world. It is why each memory, each fragment feels so real. They are not mere imaginings‚Äîthey are echoes, reflections of a world you belong to, a world that is calling you back.‚Äù

Lily swallowed, a strange ache rising in her chest as she thought of all the other oddities she‚Äôd brushed off. ‚ÄúThe blueberry pie‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúI tasted it so clearly, even though Jason said his family only ever ordered cherry. I could feel the tartness, the sweetness of the blueberry pie‚Ä¶ like it was something I‚Äôd had a thousand times.‚Äù

Madame Vira nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúThat was a memory of *your* world, of your family‚Äôs tradition. But here, those memories clash with his reality, and the fractures grow each time. These inconsistencies may seem small, harmless, but each one is a thread that tugs at the seams of this world, stretching it, tearing it.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs heart pounded as he looked at Lily, a mixture of fear and frustration churning within him. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre saying all these little things‚Äîthese differences we‚Äôve noticed‚Äîthey‚Äôre from her world?‚Äù He shook his head, struggling to wrap his mind around it. ‚ÄúBut why now? Why is it happening only since we met?‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs eyes grew somber as she looked between them. ‚ÄúBecause, Jason, your meeting was the catalyst. Your bond, your connection, it is what pulled her through, what allows her memories to bleed into this world. Love, especially a love as strong as yours, defies boundaries‚Äîit reaches beyond reason, beyond realms. The two of you together have created an anchor, a bridge between worlds that should have remained separate. And with each memory, each inconsistency, that bridge grows weaker, unable to sustain the weight of two lives overlapping.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs face grew pale, her mind replaying every strange detail that had lingered on the edge of her consciousness: the memories that didn‚Äôt align, the deja vu, the odd sensation that she was both here and not here. She felt as though she were slipping, as if part of her existed somewhere she couldn‚Äôt reach. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ everything I remember that doesn‚Äôt fit,‚Äù she said slowly, her voice shaking, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all from‚Ä¶ from somewhere else. My world.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Madame Vira replied, her tone gentle yet firm. ‚ÄúAnd the more you try to reconcile these memories with his world, the more tension you create, like a storm building beneath the surface. You are in a place you do not belong, Lily, and that discord is tearing reality apart.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs mind raced, his grip on Lily‚Äôs hand tightening as he tried to hold onto the person who was becoming both familiar and foreign in the same heartbeat. He was filled with the urge to deny everything, to argue that they could make it work somehow, but the cracks were already there, creeping into the edges of his mind, stretching the boundaries of his world.

‚ÄúSo what are we supposed to do?‚Äù Jason asked, his voice heavy, almost defeated. ‚ÄúIf being together is causing this‚Ä¶ if she‚Äôs really from another world‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, the enormity of the situation pressing down on him.

Madame Vira‚Äôs expression grew grave, her eyes flickering with the weight of what she was about to say. ‚ÄúYou must make a choice. If you remain bound together, this world will continue to fracture, to bend under the strain of a love that defies its laws. But if you part‚Ä¶ if you let her go‚Ä¶ the balance may be restored, and reality may heal.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs heart clenched, a sharp pain radiating through her chest as she met Jason‚Äôs gaze, his own eyes reflecting the turmoil she felt. She wanted to deny it, to tell Madame Vira that there had to be another way, but a small voice whispered that she had already felt the truth of it long before tonight. She could feel it in every strange memory, in every uncanny moment that seemed to contradict the world around her.

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt go?‚Äù she asked, her voice barely a whisper, her hand trembling in Jason‚Äôs.

Madame Vira‚Äôs face grew still, her voice steady yet sorrowful. ‚ÄúThen reality will unravel, slowly at first, but inevitably. You will see it everywhere: familiar places shifting, objects appearing and vanishing, time itself bending under the weight of your presence. Eventually, there will be nothing left but fragments, echoes of what once was. A world broken by love.‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs face grew still, her eyes dark and unfathomable as she reached beneath the table, her hands moving with a reverence that made Jason and Lily hold their breath. When she straightened, she held a shallow, silver bowl filled with water. The candlelight reflected on its surface, casting rippling shadows that danced across the tent walls. The water shimmered, a strange, almost unnatural light catching in its depths, as if it held secrets waiting to be revealed.

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Madame Vira murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, ‚Äúis the mirror of worlds. Through it, one may glimpse the truth that lies beyond sight, a truth that words alone cannot convey.‚Äù

Jason felt a shiver run down his spine, the weight of her words pressing on him as he and Lily leaned forward. Madame Vira placed the bowl carefully on the table, and as her hands hovered above it, the water began to ripple, small waves forming concentric circles that shimmered with a faint, silvery light.

‚ÄúLook into the water,‚Äù she said, her voice soft and commanding. ‚ÄúSee what lies beyond your understanding.‚Äù

Jason hesitated, but Lily reached out, almost mesmerized, her gaze locked on the shifting patterns in the water. As they peered into the bowl, the ripples steadied, revealing a vision within. Shapes emerged, hazy at first, like figures caught in mist, but gradually sharpening until they could make out a world‚Äî*Lily‚Äôs* world.

They saw familiar places, streets and buildings that mirrored their own, yet held a subtle, uncanny difference. The colors were slightly muted, the edges sharper, and there was a sense of order and precision that felt both strange and familiar. But as they watched, Jason noticed something unsettling: every scene was devoid of *him.* People passed by, figures laughed and moved, but his presence was missing, as if he had been erased from her world entirely.

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ where am I?‚Äù Jason asked, his voice barely a murmur, feeling an odd pang of absence as he watched Lily‚Äôs world unfold without him.

Madame Vira‚Äôs voice was grave. ‚ÄúYou do not exist there, Jason. This world‚Äî*her* world‚Äîhas no place for you. Her reality is complete without you, a world balanced and untouched by your presence. Your love draws her here, where you belong, but her world cannot contain both of you. You are separated, divided by forces that have kept your paths from crossing‚Ä¶ until now.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs hand tightened around his, her face a mixture of longing and confusion as she watched. The scenes continued to shift, revealing fragments of her world, a life that seemed both hauntingly familiar and heartbreakingly distant. She couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of something missing, as though she were looking at a home she couldn‚Äôt return to, a version of herself she could barely remember.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ if he can‚Äôt exist in my world, what happens if I stay here?‚Äù she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, fear slipping into her words.

Madame Vira‚Äôs fingers brushed the surface of the water, and the vision in the bowl shifted again, darkening as the ripples stilled into a new image. This time, the scene was more ominous, filled with shadows that crept over familiar places, twisting them into something unrecognizable. The coffee shop they often visited appeared, but its walls warped, colors bleeding and shifting, the edges blurring as if the structure itself was dissolving. Jason‚Äôs world was unraveling before their eyes, piece by piece, everything slowly collapsing into chaos.

Buildings flickered in and out of existence, objects twisted and changed form, people wandered aimlessly, their expressions blank and confused, memories slipping from their minds like water through fingers. Even the stars above twisted, flickering with an unnatural intensity, as though the sky itself were tearing open. Lily gasped, pulling her hand to her mouth as she watched the destruction unfold. This was Jason‚Äôs world‚Äî*their* world‚Äîand she was watching it fall apart, the familiar places breaking into fragments, a place unrecognizable from the one they stood in now.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù Lily‚Äôs voice was barely audible, a tremor in her tone as tears pricked her eyes. ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt happen. I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs gaze softened with sympathy. ‚ÄúReality is fragile, and your love defies its boundaries. You pull each other‚Äôs worlds into a state of discord that cannot last. This is the cost of your bond, the consequence of a love that crosses worlds.‚Äù

Jason clenched his fists, his mind racing with denial, with desperation to find a way to change what they were seeing. ‚ÄúThere has to be a way to stop this,‚Äù he insisted, his voice tight with determination. ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be the only choice. I can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ lose her.‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs eyes held his, a flicker of sorrow passing over her face as she lifted her hands over the bowl again, letting the water shift into one last image. The ripples calmed, and in their place appeared two figures‚Äî*Jason and Lily*, but somehow‚Ä¶ not them. They seemed to blend, their reflections shifting and merging like faces seen in half-formed dreams. As the shapes came into focus, the distinction between them blurred, as though they were fragments of a single person, two halves of a whole, reflections that mirrored and overlapped with a strange harmony.

Jason and Lily stared into the bowl, their breaths shallow as they watched the figure within, flickering and shifting. It was as if the water itself were caught in a constant state of indecision, unable to settle on a single form. The face in the bowl was sometimes Lily‚Äôs, sometimes Jason‚Äôs, and sometimes both at once, their features blending, merging, then separating again‚Äîa singular, blurred shape cast between worlds.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what does that mean?‚Äù Jason asked, his voice hoarse, barely more than a whisper. His heart raced, a quiet dread settling deep within him as he stared into the shifting reflection, a reflection that seemed to pull him closer, reaching out to grasp a truth just beyond his understanding.

Madame Vira‚Äôs gaze grew distant, unreadable, and she let her hand hover over the bowl, casting an elongated shadow across the shifting image within. Her lips parted as if to speak, but then she hesitated, something dark and knowing in her eyes as she looked at them both.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she murmured, almost to herself, as she lifted her hand from the water, letting the vision in the bowl ripple and blur once more. ‚ÄúYou are not ready for that truth‚Ä¶ not yet.‚Äù She looked at them both with an intensity that was both compassionate and stern. ‚ÄúSome things, you must choose to understand, and that choice lies ahead of you.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs fingers tightened around Jason‚Äôs, her voice trembling as she whispered, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre supposed to just decide our fate without understanding this? Without knowing what‚Ä¶ what we even are?‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs face softened, a faint trace of sorrow in her expression. ‚ÄúIt is not what you *are* that matters, child. It is what you will choose to become. The path you walk now will determine whether this‚Äù‚Äîshe gestured toward the rippling water, the shifting figure that neither of them could fully recognize‚Äî‚Äúbecomes your reality. You must decide before that choice is made for you, and this truth becomes your prison.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs mind whirled, his pulse racing as he stared into the bowl, trying to make sense of the figure, of the strange merging and separating that felt both familiar and terrifyingly foreign. Every instinct screamed at him to understand, to demand answers, but something in Madame Vira‚Äôs eyes told him he was only glimpsing a shadow of something much larger, a truth he wasn‚Äôt ready to face.

‚ÄúBut how are we supposed to decide?‚Äù he asked, his voice filled with a mix of desperation and anger. ‚ÄúHow can we make a choice like this without knowing what it all means?‚Äù

Madame Vira‚Äôs gaze turned piercing, her eyes steady as she replied. ‚ÄúYou must follow your heart, as painful as that choice may be. It is not the mind that will guide you in this; logic cannot hold the weight of your connection. But know this: every moment you linger here together, every memory you share, draws you closer to this fate.‚Äù

Jason looked at Lily, his heart torn between the love he felt and the uncertainty that gnawed at him, a fear that they were crossing into something irreversible. ‚ÄúWhat if we‚Äôre not ready?‚Äù he murmured, a question that felt as vast and unknowable as the universe itself.

Madame Vira placed her hands over the bowl, her fingers resting gently on its rim, obscuring the last traces of the shifting image within. ‚ÄúReady or not, the choice is yours to make,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúBut once made, it cannot be undone.‚Äù

The water settled, the reflections fading as the room plunged back into stillness, the candle‚Äôs flickering light casting shadows that seemed to stretch further into the dark corners of the tent. And as Jason and Lily sat there, the weight of her words pressed down on them, the haunting image of the figure lingering in their minds, a silent reminder of the choice they would soon have to make‚Äîbefore the shadow in the water became their reality.

Lily‚Äôs eyes filled with tears, her face pale and stricken as she shook her head, trying to deny the weight of the fortune teller‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for this,‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask to be‚Ä¶ whatever I am.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs heart twisted as he looked at her, a fierce protectiveness welling up inside him. Wrapping an arm around her, he pulled her close, shielding her from Madame Vira‚Äôs penetrating gaze. ‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù he snapped, his voice cold and hard. He turned to the fortune teller, anger flaring in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had your fun, but that‚Äôs it. We‚Äôre done here.‚Äù

Madame Vira watched him calmly, her gaze steady, as though his words meant nothing to her. Jason felt his jaw tighten, his pulse racing with a mixture of anger and disbelief. How dare she toy with them like this, with her ominous prophecies and dark warnings, as if she had any control over their lives?

‚ÄúThis is all just‚Ä¶ nonsense,‚Äù Jason muttered, shaking his head as he pulled Lily toward the tent‚Äôs exit. ‚ÄúA bunch of theatrics, illusion magic, cheap tricks to scare people who don‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

Lily hesitated, glancing back at the fortune teller, doubt flickering in her eyes. Her usually carefree spirit was shaken, and she felt the weight of Madame Vira‚Äôs words settling over her like a shadow she couldn‚Äôt shake. ‚ÄúBut Jason‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmured, her voice wavering. ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶ what if it‚Äôs all true? The inconsistencies‚Ä¶ the coffee shop walls, the blueberry pie, the way things just don‚Äôt fit.‚Äù She looked at him, her eyes wide and pleading. ‚ÄúWhat if this is real?‚Äù

Jason let out a sharp, humorless laugh, trying to push back the creeping dread gnawing at the edges of his mind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Lily. It‚Äôs just a fluke‚Äîa scam, someone trying to mess with us. A nut job with a crystal ball trying to make herself sound important.‚Äù He shook his head, dismissing the unsettling images and words as he tried to ignore the part of him that remembered every strange, inexplicable thing they‚Äôd experienced since they met.

But Madame Vira‚Äôs voice interrupted his thoughts, calm yet carrying a weight that silenced his denial. ‚ÄúBelieve what you will, Jason,‚Äù she said softly, her tone tinged with an almost sorrowful finality. ‚ÄúBut remember this: illusions cannot unravel reality, and trickery cannot tear apart the world. You can dismiss me if you wish, but the truth does not bend to your will.‚Äù

Jason kept his grip on Lily‚Äôs hand, pulling her toward the exit, his mind refusing to entertain the fortune teller‚Äôs ominous warnings. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, Lily. This is nothing but some sick joke. None of it is real.‚Äù

But as they reached the tent‚Äôs entrance, Madame Vira‚Äôs voice cut through the air, a final, chilling warning that seemed to resonate beyond the tent walls. ‚ÄúBe careful, both of you. Once you choose your path, it will not be undone. I cannot protect you if you make the wrong choice.‚Äù

Lily turned back, her gaze lingering on Madame Vira, caught between fear and a quiet sense of understanding. But Jason tugged on her hand, his grip firm as he led her out of the tent and back into the noise and lights of the fairground. The world outside seemed almost too bright, too loud, the night air heavy with the mingling scents of caramel and smoke, as if the fair itself were an illusion.

Lily glanced up at him, her expression conflicted. ‚ÄúJason, don‚Äôt you think‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you think we should at least try to understand? What if she‚Äôs right?‚Äù

Jason shook his head, forcing a smile he didn‚Äôt quite feel. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not right, Lily. She‚Äôs just a woman who makes a living off scaring people into believing they‚Äôre part of some cosmic mystery. None of this is real. She didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about, okay? It was all just to scare us. Don‚Äôt let her get in your head.‚Äù

Lily looked at him, her eyes filled with doubt, her voice a whisper. ‚ÄúBut what if she was right, Jason? What if‚Ä¶ what if I don‚Äôt belong here? What if‚Ä¶ I ruin everything just by being here?‚Äù

Jason took her hands, his grip firm, determined. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here with me, Lily. You‚Äôre real. You belong, I love you, and nothing she said can change that.‚Äù

But as they walked further from the tent, the echo of Madame Vira‚Äôs words lingered in the back of Jason‚Äôs mind, a dark, unsettling reminder he couldn‚Äôt shake. The fairground lights and laughter seemed distant, muffled, as though he were moving through a half-formed dream. He wanted to brush it off, to return to the warm simplicity of the fair with Lily, yet Madame Vira‚Äôs warning clung to him, her voice woven into his thoughts like a shadow.

Just beyond the threshold of the tent, Madame Vira watched them leave, her expression solemn and filled with quiet sadness. Her gaze lingered on the place where they‚Äôd stood, as if she could still see them, their figures etched in the dim glow of the tent‚Äôs interior.

‚ÄúThey think they have all the time in the world,‚Äù she murmured to the empty air, her voice low and filled with an old sorrow. Her fingers trailed over the table as though searching for a connection to something unseen, something fragile. ‚ÄúBut time is slipping‚Ä¶ faster than they know.‚Äù

She paused, her eyes narrowing as though she were peering into the spaces between moments, listening to something that only she could hear. ‚ÄúThe mirrors of fate are cracking even further,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúAnd once they shatter, only fragments will remain‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Jason and Lily left the fortune teller‚Äôs tent, stepping back into the bright lights and bustling energy of the fairground. The sights and sounds felt overwhelming after the dim, haunting quiet of Madame Vira‚Äôs tent, and they walked in silence, both lost in thought, still feeling the weight of her warnings hanging over them.

As they passed by a row of food stalls, Jason‚Äôs friend Cole spotted them from a distance and jogged over, his usual grin replaced by a look of mild concern. ‚ÄúHey! You two look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost,‚Äù he joked, eyeing their pale faces. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

Jason ran a hand over his face, trying to shake off the lingering unease. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ we just had the weirdest experience,‚Äù he said, glancing at Lily, who nodded, her eyes still wide. ‚ÄúWe went to see this fortune teller, and she‚Ä¶ she said some pretty unsettling things. It felt‚Ä¶ real. Way too real.‚Äù

Cole raised an eyebrow, amused but intrigued. ‚ÄúFortune teller? Here at the fair?‚Äù He looked around, his brow furrowing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been all over the grounds tonight, and I didn‚Äôt see any fortune teller.‚Äù

Jason frowned, glancing over his shoulder in the direction they‚Äôd come from. ‚ÄúYeah, the tent was right over there. I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He turned, pointing toward where Madame Vira‚Äôs tent should have been, tucked at the edge of the fairground near the game booths.

But when he looked back, the tent was gone.

In its place was only a brightly colored game booth, packed with people tossing rings and winning stuffed animals. Jason blinked, his heart pounding as he scanned the area, but there was no sign of Madame Vira‚Äôs tent‚Äîno shadows, no flickering red light, nothing. It was as though the fortune teller had vanished without a trace.

Lily‚Äôs hand tightened around his, her face paling as she realized the tent was truly gone. She looked up at him, her eyes wide, a flicker of fear reflecting her own sense of disbelief.

‚ÄúUh, you sure you‚Äôre okay, man?‚Äù Cole asked, chuckling nervously, sensing the tension in their silence.

Jason shook his head, a chill creeping over him. ‚ÄúIt was here, Cole. I swear‚Ä¶ it was here.‚Äù

But no matter how hard he looked, the tent, and Madame Vira, were nowhere to be seen.",1,1730503145.0,u_SirBigdog01,0,1.0,False

We would just feed her and lay her down. Well, around 3.5 weeks she just decided to not stay asleep and would wake up and start fussing. We figured she was having her growth spurt. She also started cluster feeding. All signs of the growth. So we pretty much had to hold her constantly. 

Well today, she‚Äôs 4 weeks. I just figured ok, let me try swaddling her and see if that will help cause we can‚Äôt hold her 24/7.

1ghis8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ghis8v/i_broke_up_with_my_best_friend/,I broke up with my best friend ,"So, my ex and I broke up last week. It was a terrible argument. Over nothing but at the time it was everything. Without getting into details I overheard my ex on the phone with her best friend venting about me. It triggered abuse at the hand of a family member that has been putting me down most of my life. It wasn‚Äôt what she said that hurt really. What hurt was that SHE said it. 
I had been falling out of love with her for a couple of weeks. I was shutting down. I knew I was, she sensed it too. But I absolutely cherish our friendship. My favorite part of life with her was people watching. And silly conversations. I loved coffee in the morning. I did LOVE HER with all of my heart.
The argument got nasty and toxic. Entirely on my part, I am ashamed to say. We mutually broke up. I had been planning it for weeks. I wanted to say it just right. I wanted it to be respectful. It wasn‚Äôt though.
Now that it‚Äôs over I am not heart broken. I don‚Äôt pine over her. What I miss more than anything is talking to her. Making her smile or laugh. Asking her advice. Sharing my day with her. Listening to her tell me about her day. I am not sad or sorry that I broke up with my GF. I am devastated that I lost my best friend.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I know I need to change one variable at a time - amount, tamping pressure or grind size.

Grind size used: 15 and 

Amount used: 8 seconds (sorry I don't weigh it, which I probably should)

Since this coffee is a dark roast (bottom left of bag), I know that generally it is suggested to make the grind size bigger. I've tried that and it still tastes not so good...maybe because I tamped it too much.

The manual said the espresso should start flowing around 8 seconds after starting the extraction and that the flow should mimic warm honey. Are these useful tips?

I really don't know what to do so I wanted to ask the experts on here...

Thanks in advance!

1ghinb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1ghinb5/parents_in_50s_had_a_baby_im_going_nuts_advice/,"Parents in 50's had a baby, I'm going nuts. Advice/ support wanted.","I'll try my best to keep it as short as I can, but here is some background:

I am 23 years old and a biological female-- I have two sisters; one is 12 and the other one is 1 years old. 

My parents are in their mid-50's and when I was gone at university (nobody told me any of this until after the fact), they figured out with doctors that my mom could still conceive for a very short while-- and made the decision to have a baby. 

It was all a shock for me because I was away from home and would hear stories on the phone for many months about my middle-aged mom being too sick to leave home. She became very much underweight and it was horrifying. I genuinely thought she had a terminal condition for about 6 months because nobody wanted to tell me the truth and I had no idea she could still have kids or was even thinking about it. 

For as long as I can remember, I've naturally found babies to be scary, gross, and unappealing. When my first sister (12) was born, I'll admit that we didn't become close until she was about 2 or 3 years old and could do fun things like having conversations and playing- I felt no connection to her when she was a baby, and now we are inseparable best friends. We were lucky that she was a really easy baby- minimal crying, she loved to laugh and sleep- so my parents didn't need help with her.

This new baby however is a whole nother story. I believe that my parents are too old to raise her properly (bending and sitting on the floor is hard for both of them), and a lot of tasks fall onto me and my other sister. 

I'm graduated and moved back home currently pursuing an online master's program, and the baby has completely disrupted life as I knew it. She cries and throws floor tantrums almost 24/7 and it is loud enough to be heard throughout the entire home even with the doors closed. This often disrupts my classes so (to the dismay of my parents,) I started leaving home and taking them in coffee shops or with other classmates. 

My mom has me watch the baby about an hour every day while she picks up my other sibling from school, and it is the lowlight of my life. I love my sister in the ""I know you are my family"" way, and of course always make sure she is safe when I am watching her- but I feel no special emotional connection to her whatsoever. If she cries, I think it's fine as long as she is safe, because she always cries anyway. 

I bought earplugs for this task and they have helped a lot, but my mom is always very critical of how I watch her. She said I should ""have a soul and learn to want to play with her more"". If she is sitting quietly in her seatbelt chair I think it is fine to leave her there because she is relaxed and totally fine, but my mom always gets pissed that I don't want to remove her from the chair and play. I personally think it isn't fair to criticize how I watch her if she is perfectly healthy, I am doing so for no cost, and I don't even have a choice.

I would like to clarify that I do not feel angry or get negative feelings with the baby, I just feel totally indifferent about the fact that she exists.

Both parents make a point to go ""isn't she SOOOOO CUTE,"" whenever they can in front of me to try and get some kind of reaction, but I really do not think she is cute, I have never found any babies to be cute. I don't think they understand that my disgust is not something personal or something I can control I feel the same about all babies. Sometimes I think my life would be a lot easier if I didn't feel this way, but I can't control it. 

My parents both constantly joke about me ""giving them 20 grandchildren"" because they know that babies disgust me and they like making me uncomfortable and laughing. 

All in all, I am really frustrated with how my life is going and I don't think my parents have any empathy. My parents describe their 20's as the best years of their lives. When they were 23, my mom moved to the states alone from her home country, my parents then got married and were both pursuing higher education and having fun. They would go out on weekends, live together, go to work, save money, spend money, and live life how they wanted. 

This is all I crave in my own life. I have had a partner for the last 8 years and want nothing more than to experience the 20's my parents did, but with him in my own life. I'd give anything to marry my high school sweetheart and live with him in our own place even if it was tiny. I'm currently back home trying to finish my master's, find a job, and save up-- but I need this phase of my life to be over as soon as possible. 

Whenever I try to talk to my parents about my point-of-view they are quick to cut me off and call me ungrateful. The only reason I haven't completely lost it is because I am grateful to have a place to sleep. 



I have posted about this before in more detail on other subs, I'm just exhausted. 

I am curious to what you guys think-- am I broken for not wanting to take care of my parent's baby? They have called me a psychopath and ""not a team player"" before since I made the mistake of opening up to them about not having any feelings about the baby-- but last I recall, nobody was giving them babies to watch in their 20s...",90,1730502714.0,childfree,66,0.96,False

This is gonna be a long but honest and emotional ride so bear with me.
Td;lr at the bottom. 

I (21f) started my first job in august at a restaurant serving Crepes. I started in the kitchen cooking and eventually got an offer to work as barista too. I agreed expecting to be working both since my actual passion is cooking but thought barista would also do good on my resume. 

I‚Äôm almost the only person in this crew that speak the native language of my country (Norway) and the others choose to speak English anyway because it‚Äôs easier. This causes a language barrier and lots of misunderstandings that I will mention.

The people i will be referring to (fake names) I will also mention nationality since it‚Äôs relevant to the story

The owner - Dan M 40‚Äôs idk
‚ÄúManager‚Äù - Ally F 30‚Äôs(Slavic)
Coworker - Oona F late 20‚Äôs(Slavic)
Coworker - Agnes F 16 (Ukrainian)
Coworker - Tiana F late 20‚Äôs (Ukrainian)
My bf - Flynn M 21 (Norwegian as me)

My first day went great, but already on my second day it all went downhill, I was in the kitchen with Oona and Agnes and I was doing my best to learn and follow instructions but this day turned out to be extremely busy, Oona was not equipped to manage two people while also managing her own tasks. Agnes was new before me this year. I did my best to do tasks as told but got plenty of ‚Äúno do this‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt just stand there‚Äù etc. because they were frankly not good at giving instructions understandably in the high stress. I noticed Agnes was getting more and more annoyed at me when I asked her to repeat her instructions since I couldn‚Äôt always understand her from the loud fans and her Ukrainian accent. I would just tell her ‚Äúone more time please‚Äù and such and she‚Äôd eventually yell at me saying ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs so hard to understand??‚Äù I could sense she was sensitive about her accent since she‚Äôd react this way especially when I couldn‚Äôt understand her. 
Agnes would pick at me all day until she outright yelled at me to ‚Äúuse my head‚Äù and ‚ÄúTHINK‚Äù because my fried brain poured oil through a sift instead of just directly into the bowl while prepping a sauce. It made no difference in the result but it made sense for some reason in the moment. I said nothing and just let her go off and finish grabbing stuff from my hands. I figured arguing would only waste time and energy. 

At the end of the day I asked Oona if she‚Äôd be more patient with me since she‚Äôd also picked at me and said it‚Äôs my second etc. she was nice about it so I asked if Agnes is usually like this, she said no shes never been this way. I thought this was strange and she said she‚Äôd talk to Agnes and that this behavior was not okay. I was relieved I didn‚Äôt have to.
When I came home and told Flynn he got upset for me and wanted to do something to help so he wrote a review on their restaurant acting like a family saying something like ‚Äúwe had a great time, food was great but we could hear an employee yelling at her coworker and this ruined the mood and made the rest of the visit sour, it‚Äôs sad to see such bad energy in the kitchen‚Äù 

I had a shift the next day and this day I worked with Ally in the kitchen and another woman I didn‚Äôt see much, as barista. They brought up the review and I acted as if I didn‚Äôt know about this and told them what had happened and both were shocked and Ally said she would also talk to Agnes about this and inform Dan. This day is when I was told ‚ÄúThese Ukrainians have such an insecurity about their accent, there‚Äôs another Ukrainian girl who works here (Tiana) who trained Agnes and she‚Äôs a lot to handle‚Äù

After this Agnes improved for a little while and I was set up to work with Tiana and Agnes one day in the kitchen. The first thing Tiana does is react to my name like she doesn‚Äôt want to even try to pronounce it, so I give her my nickname but when she tells me hers and I try to pronounce it she corrects me until she‚Äôs happy. I had no problem with this but found it weird she didn‚Äôt want to try to pronounce my name correctly. The second thing Tiana tells me that day is ‚Äúso one thing about me is that when I get stressed I will scream. Don‚Äôt take it personally I just need to scream and anything and anyone‚Äù I don‚Äôt give her a super enabling response, I just jokingly say stuff like ‚Äúgirl that‚Äôs not good‚Äù 

I was in charge of salads this day which is to just wash the different salads in the sink, rip it into big pieces, mix and place in buckets to store. I start washing the sink with a new sponge (I also noticed they don‚Äôt change sponges and cloths when they‚Äôre clearly very dirty and smell sour) and Agnes comes up and says ‚Äúnoo what are you doing you don‚Äôt have to do this just fill with water and-‚Äú etc. I interrupt her with ‚Äúno the sink is dirty I have to wash it‚Äù we both just speak over each other and she pushes the drain stopper down while there‚Äôs still dish soap in the sink and tried grab salads to put in. I let her do whatever she does and let her leave and I finish cleaning the sink. I figured that she won‚Äôt give up and won‚Äôt listen so I just do what I need to do after she‚Äôs had her go at me. 

Throughout the morning they cackle in Russian together, turn to me and ask me something and then laugh and continue in Russian. Dan was in for a while and came over twice to correct Tiana. Once to say ‚ÄúTiana you are everywhere, quiet down‚Äù and she says ‚ÄúI know‚Äù and laughs. And second to say ‚Äúplease only speak in English‚Äù and she complains and whines while he repeats himself. Shortly after she comes to me and says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt mind that we speak in Russian right?‚Äù I say ‚ÄúI would like to know what you‚Äôre saying‚Äù she says nothing and walks away. They both mock how I decorate the food and imitate my movements throughout the day until I say ‚ÄúI get it enough‚Äù and they stop.

Tiana leaves in the middle of the day and I‚Äôm left alone with Agnes. She surprisingly changes and is very sweet the rest of the day now that the influence of Tiana is gone, and even brought her lunch over to my table and says ‚Äúwe eat together‚Äù and I make it clear that I‚Äôm happy she came over and invite her to sit. 

I never changed my attitude towards her, I always greeted her, and said goodbye. I stood my ground whenever she was unreasonable but tried to compliment her and be respectful otherwise. 

Gradually Agnes turns sour towards me again and don‚Äôt greet me in the morning or say goodbye when we leave, when I say her name when I need something she won‚Äôt look at me. 

After working in the kitchen maybe 8-10 shifts I started barista training.

Oona and Ally trained me and I quickly noticed that they often had completely opposite work methods, small things but made a big deal of it. Such as napkin between the tea cup and plate/no napkin, 2 spoons of coca/4 spoons for hot chocolate, pour drink before serving or give customer drink and glass to pour themselves. To me it didn‚Äôt matter but whenever I‚Äôd work with either of them they‚Äôd tell me to do the opposite when I did what the other person said. This got tiring so I chose to follow Ally‚Äôs instructions since she‚Äôs been there the longest and her ways made more sense. Ally also said Oona has blatantly disregarded her commands of for example not using too many napkins and such. 

Whenever I‚Äôd work with Ally as barista everything was fine and dandy, she is so calm, so respectful, so patient and gives me room to make my own decisions that I deem effective. 
Whenever I‚Äôd work with Oona it was constant comments and contradicting of instructions.
She once told me in the span of an hour ‚Äúdon‚Äôt grab the plates from people too early, it gives off ‚Äúleave please‚Äù energy‚Äù and then ‚Äúthere‚Äôs dishes everywhere to take go take them‚Äù I then said to her ‚Äúalright what‚Äôs your sweet spot for collecting dishes because I don‚Äôt know what you want‚Äù and she said ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt take their plates while they‚Äôre eating ofc‚Äù 
I never did that, I always waited until I hadn‚Äôt seen them chewing for at least 5 minutes. This was also very snarky.

Eventually I come to learn how truly bad this place is from Ally. She was once manager but quit and just went back to a normal employee since whenever Dan would give Ally a task to do, she‚Äôd do something or suggest something to accomplish the task and he‚Äôd always just do whatever he wanted instead. Like ‚Äúkind of‚Äù fixing the super lazy and almost broken barista coffee machine instead of buying a new one. 
Ally felt like she meant nothing as a manager so she downgraded to keep her sanity.
All of the employees had their fair share of issues and the common thing was that nobody would cooperate properly. They were quick to say how everything should be but would not reciprocate. 

I realized Oona was also troubled with her accent or unfortunate lack of English vocabulary when she gave me a few tasks to do and the last one was ‚Äúchange the coffee thing in the so and so‚Äù I didn‚Äôt quite get what she said but figured I ask after completing the first tasks. I come back and ask again and she says ‚Äúfill the coffee grounds on the left side!‚Äù She kept saying the left side. Now, there‚Äôs two coffee items in the bar, the brewed coffee in a barrel thingy made with coffee grounds and the barista machine which has coffee beans at the top in containers. We go back and fourth as I try to understand exactly what she means because she keeps saying ‚Äúthe left side‚Äù when I‚Äôm trying to understand ‚Äúcoffee beans or grounds?‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt understand what I mean by beans so she comes over to me and points at the left container with beans. And I say ‚Äúyes these are beans not grounds‚Äù she raises her voice at me for the first time saying something about what‚Äôs so hard to understand and we need to communicate with each other etc. i eventually find the beans and we move on. 

The misunderstandings are piling up and at this point I‚Äôm quite frustrated and find myself grinding these experiences in my head in my time off but keep my head up thinking I‚Äôll get a handle on it eventually. There‚Äôs also this course Dan offered me that the company will be paying for that I really want in my resume so I persevere.

After a while of only getting barista shifts I asked in September when Ally was setting up the schedule for October for more kitchen shifts, she said she‚Äôd find me some days. 

Whilst I work as barista the tension between me and Agnes grows and I don‚Äôt know why. Whenever I worked in the kitchen the baristas would tell me multiple times to put the order receipt on the counter next to the order so that they could easily just check the table number to avoid access stress of remembering since the tables are not marked (there are only 12).
But when I don‚Äôt see the receipts at the counter I ask Agnes and she always says ‚Äúyou should remember, you did this one‚Äù and stuff. I know I should remember but it‚Äôs not my strongest ability yet but i thought it would come with time, yet Agnes would not let me have this process and just argue with me every time instead of just telling me, causing me to stand there with the food for a few more seconds until the other cook would tell me. 

I was given two days in the kitchen for October, on the first day I show up and Ally is there to tell me that it was changed and I was gonna work barista that day with her, I thought it was okay since when Ally is there all is well. 

There was also an issue with breaks. It was okay to sit and eat but whenever I‚Äôd sit down for a couple minutes I‚Äôd always get a ‚Äúwhat are you doing get up‚Äù type comment when everyone else regularly took smoke breaks, as if just resting my feet wouldn‚Äôt count, and I don‚Äôt smoke.
A couple of shifts ago Oona just had her smoke break and I sat down to rant to Flynn about my frustration on text. I had sat down for only 2 minutes with little traffic in the restaurant when Agnes walks past and says ‚Äúwhy are you on your phone there are customers‚Äù Oona was working and taking care of it I presumed so I snapped back with ‚ÄúOona just had her smoke break so I‚Äôm sitting down for one minute, thank you‚Äù she huffs and walks away. 

Finally we get to Saturday last weekend, I have the text where it says I‚Äôll be working in the kitchen with Agnes. I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to finally talk to her myself preferably at the very beginning to try to start fresh and figure out whatever seems to bother her that makes her walk past me as if I‚Äôm dust in the morning when I greet her. I tried to not let it hurt me but I‚Äôm not made of stone. I prepared what I wanted to say in my notes and was filling my head all week with what could possibly go wrong and how to approach her without seeming like I‚Äôm attacking her but still being honest and direct. I was very nervous.

I arrive that day a few minutes off schedule but so does Oona who has the keys so already some time lost. We always have 15 minutes to open and be ready but that doesn‚Äôt mean people start pouring in, sometimes we have quiet mornings, I was hoping for this. All I needed was 5 minutes to talk to Agnes to become friends. I greet both of them and as usual Agnes acts as if I‚Äôm not there, we go into the back room to change and I start putting on the kitchen apron, and Oona says ‚Äúno you‚Äôre not working kitchen, you‚Äôre barista today‚Äù I say ‚Äúwhat, I was set up for kitchen today by Ally‚Äù and then Agnes bursts out with ‚ÄúNo you can‚Äôt work in the kitchen‚Äù in the most degrading tone as if I‚Äôm not capable. I snap back with ‚Äúyes I can, I started working here in the kitchen‚Äù 

Instantly I‚Äôm filled with what I can only describe as discombobulating, why did no one tell me this was changed? I would not have agreed to work that day if I had known they switched up. Apparently something had happened but they just mumbled it and I didn‚Äôt care. I texted Ally to ask what happened but I got no reply as she‚Äôs on vacation. I think to myself that I at least need to try to have my talk with Agnes before leaving. I find out we have plenty of reservations which means there‚Äôs no guarantee there would be time in like an hour so I try to grab my chance quickly. There‚Äôs only one couple in the restaurant at this point who has also gotten their food and nothing else is happening that I can see so I walk over to the kitchen and I have to call Agnes‚Äôs name three times for her to even look at me. Dan is behind her so I know he saw and heard this. I ask Agnes to come with me so I can talk to her. She says she‚Äôs busy, I can see her scrolling on her phone in her chat with Dan to maybe find something but I frankly do not care as it can‚Äôt be super important. I tell her I need just a few minutes. She comes out with me and I start fumbling around to remember what I had prepared. (I can‚Äôt remember the whole interaction Clearly but I‚Äôll try to make sense of it) I manage to get out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to come at you but I‚Äôve noticed that you don‚Äôt greet me or say goodbye-‚Äú and I see she hasn‚Äôt looked up from her phone since she came out still scrolling in the chat so I follow up with ‚Äúand you‚Äôre not even looking at me right now, do you have a problem with me? Did I do something?‚Äù First she finally looks up at me, and she looks at me as if I‚Äôm not human. She says ‚Äúno I‚Äôm just busy‚Äù she starts to leave and I follow her saying ‚Äúyou have to communicate with me at work‚Äù and she just says ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want to communicate with you‚Äù I say ‚Äúyou have to it‚Äôs your job‚Äù and she says ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt have to‚Äù I finish with ‚Äúall I need from you is that you just tell me the table number or put the order with the food‚Äù and she again says i have to remember etc. I say ‚Äúokay work as a barista for one day and you can tell me that‚Äù since she hasn‚Äôt worked as barista here while everyone else kinda does both so I‚Äôve got the impression she can‚Äôt. She mumbles something and it ends with her saying okay fine and we walk separate ways. I get the feeling she said fine just to leave. 

I was prepared for her to just deny it and I know I could‚Äôve maybe had a chance for a better outcome if I had waited but I felt desperate and needed to get it over with and leave. After that I went straight to Oona to tell her I will leave soon as I‚Äôm not feeling good and briefly told her what happened and she told me not to leave her as she‚Äôd need me for all the reservations but I told her I‚Äôm sorry but I will not be in a good mental space to help. 
The anger, anxiety and sadness bomb was ticking inside me and I started feeling my heart skipping beats and took that as my queue to run to the bathroom and let out some tears and let Flynn know it went horribly. 
He reacted immediately with offering to come and get me and help. He texted me to just leave and he‚Äôd be outside waiting. I took my chance when Oona was in the dish room so she couldn‚Äôt stop me. I left in a steady pace, I was in Dan‚Äôs field of view and he said nothing. As soon as I saw Flynn I burst out in tears and he comforted me. We went around the corner so I could tell him everything.

Dan owns a second homemade chocolate confectionery cafe a few blocks away and often runs back and forth, as I‚Äôm telling Flynn everything he happens to walk past and Flynn yells his name, he turns and sees me crying yet keeps walking. Flynn yells his name two more times until he finally comes and then says ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong what happened?‚Äù Flynn takes over to say how bad it is that he just keeps going when he sees his employees crying and how his workplace is toxic. Dan just asks him not to yell in his face and keeps going on about how he‚Äôs busy and has no time for this etc, whilst Flynn keeps going about how it‚Äôs his responsibility as owner to make sure all his employees are doing okay, and he should be more involved because Dan just keeps demanding I say what happened when he was well aware of what‚Äôs been going on even before I started working there. 
All I can say is ‚ÄúAgnes will never change‚Äù insinuating that if I told him nothing would change anyway.
Dan says he needs to go and Flynn tells him to leave then and he does.

After this I just completely loose my breath and control of myself and weep my heart out in Flynn‚Äôs arms. 
We finally go home and I spend the rest of the day calming down.
I receive no text or call from Dan until the next day where he replies to the old e-mail thread from August which reads:

‚ÄúHello. 
Can you explain what happened yesterday? 
I need to know who approached who, who said what so that I can understand the whole situation. 

Sent from my iPhone‚Äù

All I could think was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre funny bro‚Äù. That ‚Äúsend from my iPhone‚Äù really made me chuckle. He saw and heard me approach Agnes, and he was told about her outburst, he has been present for plenty of times where we bicker and Agnes is clearly starting the argument. I don‚Äôt reply to this as it‚Äôs just disappointing. He has my phone number.

Today I get a text message from him that reads:
‚ÄúHello. 
Please reply to my mail, I need to know your side of the story. 
Write what happened between you and Agnes‚Äù

As long as this story is, this is where it ends for now, I haven‚Äôt replied to this either as I‚Äôve clearly seen how he prioritizes money over his crying employees who run his business for him. I‚Äôm exhausted and just want to lay down from this months long awful experience.

Thank you for listening to my ted talk.

TL;DR
A long story of how My (21f) coworker (16f) bullied me into insanity from her complete lack of respect and constantly picking fights with me. My boss who prioritizes money over his employee‚Äôs mental wellbeing and disregards all of the toxicity in his restaurant and takes no accountability for his responsibility as a business owner.

On that morning I awoke in good spirits with the intention of enjoying this beautiful day.  I prepared my coffee and sat down to read the news when suddenly I was smacked in the face with this headline that later went viral around the world.

‚ÄúI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!‚Äù

Did I deserve this? Does anyone?

Are you serious? This is the guy that wants to be the President of the United States?

Immediately he reminds us again that he‚Äôs not playing with a full deck.

That message from Trump was delivered to me and the American public only days after this beauty:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre eating the cats. They‚Äôre eating the pets of the people that live there.‚Äù

It seems like every week or so the American public is hearing a crazy wanna-be power grabbing ex-President saying the craziest, hateful things one can imagine.

There is no bottom too low for this troubled man.

And yet we are supposed to disbelieve honored generals who warn us this man is a danger to our nation.

We should disregard Vice President Mike Pence, General Mark Milley, and former White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly.  They ALL have it in for Trump, ay?

We should also disregard the opinion of Trump‚Äôs former national security advisor, John Bolton. Instead we should believe in Donald Trump?!

His supporters tell us either he was misquoted or he was not misquoted but what he said was misunderstood. It‚Äôs not really what he meant. He was taken out of context.

They say we should not believe our eyes and ears because we are being misled ‚Äúlike sheep.‚Äù

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Ya know, this shit gets old after a while.

Can you imagine how exhausting it must be for MAGAs to have to explain, excuse, rationalize, and sane-wash the crazy things their cult leader says everyday?

MAGAs and Trump supporters have the impossible task of constantly trying to convince themselves and everyone else that Trump is not crazy when the rest of us know he‚Äôs a complete nut-job.

He‚Äôs a criminal, a sex abuser, a traitor to the constitution, and he‚Äôs mentally unstable.  In a word, he‚Äôs ‚Äúunfit‚Äù for the office.

When all the votes are counted I think MAGAs will all privately be saying the same thing to each other:
