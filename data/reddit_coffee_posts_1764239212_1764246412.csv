Luckily it wasn’t coffee or something sticky. I dried it with a towel right away, but I had a work meeting starting literally at the same moment, so I tried joining anyway.

The screen, camera, speakers and trackpad all worked, but when I tried clicking to unmute or stop my camera, the clicks didn’t register correctly. Same issue with an external mouse, so it was not trackpad only.

When I noticed the glitching, I shut it down from the top menu, but it kept turning back on by itself. It only fully powered off after I held the physical power button. It stayed on for maybe 5 to 10 minutes after the spill.

Since then, I used a vacuum to pull out as much water as possible and left it upside down next to a cold air blower. It’s been sitting like that for a couple hours now. I have work to do and I’m tempted to try powering it on tonight once it’s been about 12 hours.

What would you recommend? It’s my work laptop, so I’d really prefer not to tell my employer, but I will if the thing is fried, just not ideal.",1,1764246235.0,mac,1,1.0,False
1p80wt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dundee/comments/1p80wt2/any_genuinely_low_fodmap_food_options_inaround/,Any genuinely low FODMAP food options in/around Dundee,"Hi folks. I’ve got a series of tests coming up at Ninewells that mean staying in Dundee for about five days. I’m on a low FODMAP diet for medical reasons and it is very restrictive – more than 90 percent of supermarket food is a no, and most places that do gluten free still use things like gram flour, onion, garlic, stock bases, and so on. The hotel are sorting breakfast, but their lunch and dinner options are all unsuitable.

So I’m trying to figure out how I’m going to handle lunch and dinner while I’m there. Does anyone know of anywhere in Dundee that can reliably do proper low FODMAP food, or anywhere that will adapt dishes if I explain the ingredients I need to avoid?

Even places that are willing to adapt dishes would help. Not expecting anything fancy, just trying to avoid living off coffee and rice cakes for a week. (Oh and mine’s a late if you were wondering, thankfully I am OK with lactose) ☕️🐮 

Any tips appreciated

Demand for [flats in Kochi](https://www.assethomes.in/flats-in-kochi/) and flats in Ernakulam in recent years has made the district one of the biggest property hubs, with investors and end-users both flocking to the area. But what is fueling the boom?

First and foremost, Ernakulam's great connectivity is a prime reason. The presence of the Kochi Metro, good roads, the international airport, and a crowded rail system have made commuting a piece of cake. Whether you stay in [luxury apartments in Kochi](https://www.assethomes.in/flats-in-kochi/) or low-cost housing on the periphery, you never face any issue of accessibility.

Secondly, the city's economic development has increased demand for property. Kochi boasts InfoPark, SmartCity, and a port, all of which create millions of employment opportunities. As business centers and IT parks grow, increasing numbers of working professionals prefer to reside in the vicinity, triggering more demand for quality flats in Ernakulam.

Cultural diversity is yet another feather on Ernakulam's cap. The locals enjoy a pleasant blend of tradition and modernity - from Kathakali performances to sophisticated malls like Lulu Mall and city coffee shops. This metropolitan life is attractive to families and young professionals who would like to strike a balance between work and play.

One of the reasons why Ernakulam is sparkling on the realty map is the trust developed by builders in Kerala. Top builders are offering well-designed, green, and amenity-rich apartments in Ernakulam that are affordable to all pockets, making the home-buying process easier and more credible than ever before. They offer transparent documents, modern amenities, and after-sales services which increase customer confidence. Finally, with developmental projects such as the Water Metro and continuous road widening, the future is even brighter. Property prices will appreciate consistently, making Ernakulam a smart investment for end-users and investors alike.

In short, good connectivity, economic dynamism, cultural diversity, good builders, and forward-looking infrastructure are propelling Ernakulam to the top of Kerala's real estate market. Whether you are looking for flats in Kochi or [apartments in Trivandrum](https://www.assethomes.in/flats-in-trivandrum/), now is the time to act. The way forward is obvious — Ernakulam is not just growing, it is thriving as Kerala's favorite real estate destination.",1,1764246034.0,u_NileshKasurde,0,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Everywhere I scroll, it’s the same style: a few short clips stitched together morning coffee, random MRT ride, laptop at a café, dinner with friends, quick night routine. No talking, no big story, just small moments with chill music in the back.
And the funny thing is it’s kind of addictive? Even though nothing dramatic happens, the pacing is smooth and the vibe feels comforting. A lot of creators who used to do long sit-down videos or more chaotic content are now doing these quiet little daily snippets instead. It’s like this format became the “safe default” easy to film, easy to watch, and it always fits nicely on the feed.
Some creators even have their signature style already: the same angle when they pour coffee, the same shot of their desk, the same walk to the MRT. You can tell everyone found a rhythm that works, and the mini vlog format just happens to be the easiest way to package their day without too much stress.
It’s interesting seeing how quickly the format spread, because now it feels like half the SG content out there is made up of these soft, cosy, aesthetic little vlogs that last less than a minute.

resistant depression, TDAH, and global anxiety disorder.

Been on meds since 2017, used several anti depressant (sertraline, duloxetine, even lithium) and Lorazepam before settling to Mirtazapine (used to be 30mg, but i'm at 15mg and tries to withdraws) and Atarrax for when the anxiety is too much (2 times a week usually)

I did psychedelics when younger (mushroom several times, and Salvia once) but i haven't touched them since 2019,

Used to smoke 10 joint a day, but i'm only smoking cbd since 4 years now (1-2 joint before bed) - stopped alcohol since 3 years

I spend a lot of my free time behind my computer

So my vision is clunky since several month, i got visual deformation all day long, where the shadows move, and patterns like tiles merges together in my peripheral vision. It is more intense when i'm outside. The best way to describe it s that it looks like Unreal Engine 5 ghosting while using DLSS and framegen. Most of the time there is a ""bad"" spot in vision, something that looks like just after you have been looking at a very bridght light. Also, i got trouble stabilizing my vision, and it get ""out of focus"" pretty quick. Vision is also pulsating when i'm stressed/drinking too much coffee

I've seen 2 ophthalmologist, they both say it doesn't come from the eyes, they said i got 10/10 on both eyes, but they prescribed googles for when i'm tired cause i always force on my eyes to get the focus right

I got a cyst on the pineal gland, did an MRI to see if it was the culprit, but nope it hasn't growth and isn't compressing the nerves or brain

I told my psychiatrist about it, she said it couldn't be Perpetual Hallucination Syndrome, and she also say it doesn't seems to come from the meds either

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1p80ikn,https://i.redd.it/j7rs9yjqhs3g1.png,Helping Home Baristas Brew Cappuccino — The Café Academy,"Hi everyone! I built **The Café Academy**, a platform designed to help home baristas make better coffee at home. I provide clear, step-by-step guides on espresso, milk steaming, bean selection, and equipment use, so that anyone can consistently brew coffee that tastes like it came from a café.

I created this because I want coffee drinkers to enjoy the **same great drink every time they brew**. Many home brewers struggle with inconsistent shots, weak milk foam, or confusing equipment, so I will be building guides that are practical, technique-focused, and easy to follow for anyone looking to brew coffee specifically home brewers.

I’d love feedback on a few things:

* Which parts of home coffee brewing do you find most confusing or frustrating?
* What kind of content would you like to see more of — brewing guides, equipment reviews, troubleshooting tips, or something else?
* Do you think a dedicated resource like this adds real value for home coffee enthusiasts?

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated — I want to make this as useful as possible for the community!

1p80i2u,https://i.redd.it/qjopfjg0gs3g1.png,I Finally Passed My Driving Test on the 5th Try at 35 (With ADD) -This is the mindset shift that got me through it,"On my fifth attempt, I finally passed my driving test at 35 years old, living with ADD. It’s been a long road. On my first test I failed coming out of the test centre, and on two other attempts I failed on the way back. There was even a sixth test I missed entirely because I brought my old provisional licence instead of the renewed one. It was a bumpy journey with long waiting times, near misses, a lot of money spent on lessons and tests but eventually, there was light at the end of the tunnel.

I want to share what genuinely helped me, in case it can help even one other person get through their own test.

I knew for this attempt I needed a different mindset. Failing twice right at the end made me realise that a part of me didn’t feel like  I deserved a licence. So I focused on building a positive mindset.

One thing i did was printing out a mock pass certificate. I kept it at my desk at work, took it to lessons, and even walked back to the station holding it, visualising exactly what it would feel like to finally pass. I thought about the relief, the joy, the sense of accomplishment and I tried to let myself feel those emotions beforehand.

This time, I planned the entire day as a day of celebration. Before, I went into tests like I was attending my own funeral. This time, I wanted the day to feel more like a wedding, something joyful. I planned pancakes for breakfast, took the rest of the day off, and planned  after the test to go to my favourite relaxing spot with a coffee and listen to a playlist i set out to soak in the moment. I even planned to buy sweet treats for my family so I could celebrate with them. Before I even arrived at the test centre, I had already put myself in the mindset of someone who had passed. All that was left to do was the 30-minute drive in the middle. Its like I started to build the puzzle before the test and the missing piece was the test itself to complete the perfect day.

Every day leading up to the test, I reminded myself: I’m a good driver. I deserve a licence. I’m ready. I looked at myself in mirror with strong eye contact and repeated positive affirmations.

Previously, I had a self-defeating belief that even if I passed, I would somehow be undeserving of it or scared to drive independently. To counter that, I told myself I would start slow: short trips to shops, local drives, gradually building confidence and venture further out as my confidence grows. This really helped me change that belief I had previously that might have had a sabotaging influence on my previous tests.

I also let go of obsessing over the outcome. If I passed, amazing. If not, then maybe there was something I still needed to learn, internally or mentally. Failure became an opportunity to grow, not a verdict on who I was. I focused only on what I  could control , my preparation, my mindset, my effort. And I accepted that sometimes you can do everything right and another road user might still cost you the test. If that happened, it just wasn’t my day, and I accept the outcome. The outcome was already written before I attended the test and i just needed to turn up and play my role. 

For the test itself, I broke it into intervals. From experience, the first 10 minutes and last 10 were where I was most vulnerable. My goal was simply to get through the first 10 minutes calmly , no rushing, staying alert and build momentum. The final stretch was always tricky because I could “smell” the finish line, so this time I told myself to block that out and stay fully present: one road, one junction, one situation at a time.

I accepted that I might get flustered in certain moments. When that happened, I would pause mentally, take a breath, and reset. Resetting was so important. I reminded myself: It’s okay to take a hesitation in certain situation. Take the time you need. You only need to survive a handful of those moments during the test and sometimes just one.

On the day itself, I was waiting in the room when a woman walked in with a huge smile, made eye contact, and greeted me warmly. She lit up the whole room with her energy. Another examiner came in after her with a much more gloomy and intimidating presence. Luckily for me, the joyful examiner called my name. During the test, it genuinely felt like she was rooting for me, creating such a supportive atmosphere. I’m quite a spiritual person, so I like to think I attracted that positive energy because of the positive mindset I had cultivated leading up to the day. To me, it felt like a small sign of the power of manifestation.

Remember it’s okay to feel doubt. Just acknowledge it each time it shows up. By recognising it, we can catch it before it spirals and takes over our mindset. When you notice doubt creeping in, simply think*, ‘*Oh, that’s doubt.’ Every time I did this, I found it lost its power over me. Do this as often as you need until that voice quietens.

On test day, it’s normal to feel nervous but remember that you can still perform despite that feeling. Embrace it. This is what it means to be human, to feel alive and to truly live. Pressure helps us grow and expand. Be grateful that you have a challenge in front of you that you’re capable of overcoming.",20,1764244829.0,LearnerDriverUK,5,1.0,False

We met freshman year and hit off. She’s fun, loves to go out and we bonded over late-night study sessions, and bad rom-coms. I thought she was by ride or die BFF. But it looks like I was hella wrong. 

A but of background: I’ve had a massive crush on this guy “Alex” (23M) from my psych class since last semester. We’re not super close, but we’ve flirted a ton: group hangouts, DMs, that kind of things… I was building up the courage to ask him out properly. Meanwhile, Sarah has always been single and complains about it constantly. She’s gorgeous and smart, but she has this weird competitive streak, especially with guys. I never thought it’d turn into this. 

Last month, I noticed my phone blowing up with notifications from dating apps I don’t even use. Turns out Sarah had created fake profiles using MY photos, MY bio (word from my instagram) and of course MY name. She was cat fishing guys as me. I confronted her and she laughed it off like “it’s just for fun, I was bored and wanted to see what kind of matches you’d get”. I was pissed but let it slide after she promised to delete everything. STUPID ME. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago: Alex texts me out of the blue, super excited saying he wants to meet up because “things have been amazing” and he’s got something big to ask. I’m thrilled, thinking this is my moment. We meet at a coffee shop and he drops to one knee with a ring! But then he calls me “Sarah.”???? Turns out that Sarah had been using my identity to chat with him online for months, pretending to be me but slipping in her own details. She fed him stories about our “dates” (that never happened) shared my secrets (which were actually hers) and even sent him edited pics of us together from old group photos. Alex thought he was in a long distance thing with me, but it was all her. 

He proposed to who he thought was me, but it was really to Sarah’s persona. When I explained the truth, he was devastated and blocked me on everything, thinking it was some sick prank. Sarah admitted it when I got home screaming. Her excuse? “You weren’t making a move and I liked him too.” I figured if he fell for you, it’d be easy to switch it to the real me later. She even said she was planning to reveal herself at the proposal and maybe it a surprise. Like what kind of delusional rom com villain BS is that? I thought it was unreal, a nightmare…

I lost it. I packed her stuff while she was out, changed the locks (it’s my name on the lease) and told her to get out. She’s been crashing with friends, blowing up my phone and calling me dramatic, saying I ruined her life over “a harmless crush”. Our mutual a friends are split, some say NTA because identity theft is insane, other say YTA for evicting her without notice, especially since rent’s due and she’s broke now. My parents think I overreacted and should let her in to “talk it out”. 

The worst part?? This BLEW UP on campus. Someone posted about it anonymously on the public Facebook and now everyone’s talking. Alex won’t speak to me. Sarah’s playing victim in social media and I feel like my whole life is a mess.

I know I haven't updated in over a year. Yeah, I know; I've been doing this for almost two years now; they even got me a cake for my first anniversary.

Okay, I think I have some excuses. Around my first year on the job, I started having hallucinations: moving, irregular shadows in my peripheral vision; faces in wallpaper patterns; and figures standing in doorways, but they vanished when I looked directly at them. I recognized these signs. I've been battling them since I was nineteen. Bipolar II disorder with mixed episodes. That's why updates are so hard, especially since this job is really demanding.

Anyway, this is the fourth story. I opened the manual and found the entry. My heart sank when I saw how brief it was. Those complicated delivery assignments had pages of rules and step-by-step instructions, and if followed strictly, they'd be safe. Short instructions were different. Short instructions meant almost no one could help.

1. Deliver to 1247 Carpenter Street between 7 and 8 p.m.

2. Ring the doorbell. Wait.

3. An elderly man will open the door. He will invite you in. You must accept.

4. He will pour you tea. Accept the tea, but don't drink it.

5. He will tell you a story. Listen to it completely without interrupting.

6. After the story, give him the item.

7. He will give you something in return. Accept it gladly.

8. Leave through the front door. Don't look back at the house.

9. Deliveryman M.K.'s note: The story I heard was different each time. The one I heard was about a woman who drowned her child. I still dream about it.

10. Deliveryman P.L.'s message: He gave me a photo. The person in the photo is me, taken from my own apartment. I don't know when the photo was taken. I've changed all the locks. I've started sleeping with the lights on.

11. Deliveryman T.H.'s message: Keep whatever he gives you. I tried throwing mine away, but it came back. It always comes back.

The package was a glass container containing a small plant I didn't recognize. When I wasn't looking at it directly, the plant moved; I could see it moving out of the corner of my eye, its leaves spreading out like fingers.

It was actually a familiar neighborhood, a beautiful area with well-maintained houses and neatly trimmed lawns. The house itself was a simple two-story Victorian building, painted light blue with white accents. It didn't look like a dangerous place at all. It looked like the kind of place where Grandma would bake cookies and knit blankets.

At 7:26 p.m., I rang the doorbell.

The elderly man who answered was exactly as I expected: white hair, kind eyes, wearing a cardigan and slippers. He had a genuine smile on his face.

“Ah, the delivery has arrived! Please come in, please come in. I’ve been waiting for you.”

His voice was gentle and kind, like that of a kind grandfather. I entered the house, and he gently closed the door.

The house was spotless. Every surface was covered with a tablecloth. Family photos hung on the walls—the children, the grandchildren, and a woman who must have been his wife. The air was filled with the scent of lemon polish and aromatherapy. An old-fashioned grandfather clock in the corner ticked softly.

“Sit, sit,” he said, gesturing to a patterned sofa. “I’ll go make some tea.”

He went into the kitchen, and I sat down, placing the glass container on my lap. The plant pressed its leaves against the glass, and I swore that something in the house was watching me, something that wasn’t quite an eye.

The old man returned with a tea set: porcelain cups, a matching teapot, and a bowl of sugar cubes. He carefully poured two cups of tea, as if he had done it countless times before.

“Earl Grey,” he said, handing me a cup. “A touch of lavender. My own blend.”

The aroma was enticing. I took the cup but didn’t bring it to my lips.

He sat down in the armchair opposite me, took a sip, and smiled. “I think I should tell you the story now. That’s how it is, isn’t it?”

I nodded, hesitant to speak.

“It’s a story,” he began, his voice deepening and becoming magnetic, “about a deliveryman who broke the rules.”

A chill ran down my spine.

“Actually, he was a lot like you. Young, desperate for money, and willing to ignore the oddities of the job. At first, he did very well, meticulously following every instruction. But you know, fear is like acid, slowly eroding you until you just want to escape.”

The old man’s gaze never left me. His eyes were no longer friendly.

“On his thirty-first day of work, he received a delivery order to an apartment building. It was simple: just place the food on the door marked with a red X. But he kept having nightmares, seeing strange things. When he arrived at the building, he found three doors marked with red Xs.”

The ticking of the old-fashioned clock was deafening.

“The brochure said to call the dispatch center if anything seemed amiss. But he was too tired, really too tired, and he didn’t want to wait. So he just went with his gut and chose the middle door. He put the food down, turned around, and left.”

The old man took another sip of tea.

“The problem is that order wasn’t for a real person. It was for something else, and something with specific delivery requirements. He delivered it to the wrong door. Ah, mistakes always have consequences.”

I wanted to ask the deliveryman what happened to him, but the rules said I couldn’t disturb him.

“Three days later, they found his car outside the apartment building. The engine was still running. The door was open. The delivery bag was on the front seat, empty. But the deliveryman was still missing. Although people in the building sometimes said they heard knocking coming from the walls. The rapid knocking sounded like someone trapped, trying to escape.”

The old man put down his teacup and smiled again, this time with an ancient and eerie quality.

“The moral of this story is: rules are not arbitrarily made, nor are they suggestions, much less principles that can be interpreted arbitrarily.” He explained, like my grandfather explaining a fairy tale.

He held out his hand. “Please give me the thing.”

My hands trembled as I handed him the glass container. He took it and placed it on the table beside him. The plant inside immediately began to climb up the glass wall, its form now clearly visible.

“Now, as is customary, I'll give you a gift.”

He took a small object wrapped in white cloth from the pocket of his cardigan. It was heavy and icy cold when it was handed to me.

I slowly unwrapped it. Inside was an old-fashioned silver pocket watch, intricately engraved. But upon opening it, instead of the watch face, a photograph came into view.

It was of me, sleeping in my apartment. It was taken from the perspective of someone standing at the foot of my bed, looking down at me.

The photograph had been taken the previous night.

“A reminder,” the old man said kindly, “that you are never truly alone.”

I stood, my legs barely supporting my weight.

“Thank you for the tea,” I said in a weak whisper.

“You’re welcome,” he said. “Have a safe trip, Eric.”

I walked toward the front door, the pocket watch burning hot in my pocket. I didn’t look back at the house, though I could feel him watching me the whole way until I reached my car.

My phone buzzed. “$156.25 has been deposited into your account.”

That night, I didn’t sleep a wink. I sat in the living room, lights on, staring at the bedroom doorway, wondering if something was standing there, lurking out of sight, spying on me like a photographer spying on me as I slept.

The pocket watch was on my coffee table. I tried putting it in the drawer, but an hour later it was back on the table. I tried leaving it in the car. When I came back from the bathroom, it was on the kitchen counter.

It always comes back.

Then I wanted to tell you a nice story, to give myself a break while typing; after all, this job isn't all about cannibalistic monsters.

At 3:33 PM, the phone rang. I almost didn't want to look. But the contract bound me like chains.

The address was just two words: ""Garden.""

No street, no house number. Just those two words.

When I opened the booklet and found that entry, it was different from the others. The handwriting was older and more refined, as if someone had carefully written every letter.

1. When you receive the package sent to the ""Garden,"" you've received a precious gift. Cherish this good fortune.

2. Drive north on Highway 888 until you see a dirt road marked with white stones. There are no road signs. You'll recognize it when you see it.

3. Drive 7.7 miles along this road. Even if the distance seems off, your odometer reading will still be accurate.

4. Park at the end of the road. Walk through the gate. The gate will be open.

5. The path in the garden is obvious. Follow the path to the center of the garden, where you'll see someone tending to the plants.

6. This person will talk to you. Listen carefully. They may know something about you that others don't.

7. Important: They may offer you something—food, drinks, rest, comfort, or even answers. You can accept food and drinks. You can rest if invited. You can listen for answers. However, you must absolutely not accept any physical goods or gifts, nor touch anything offered to you, except for food or drink offered directly to you.

8. This rule is absolutely valid. Whatever is offered, no matter how much you want it, you must refuse any physical goods except food and drink.

9. You will know after the meeting. Return the way you came.

12. Messenger A.M.'s message: Whatever you do, follow rule 7. My previous messengers did not follow it. They found his car at the end of the dirt road, the driver's side door open, and the engine still running. They never found him. But sometimes, delivery requests still come from ""The Garden,"" and the customer's name is his.

This delivery was special: a simple brown paper bag, like the kind for lunch. Inside were freshly baked bread, still warm, and a bottle of unlabeled wine. The aroma of the bread was intoxicating; the fragrance of yeast was flawless.

Highway 888 stretched north from the city, through the suburbs, and into rolling farmland. It took me forty minutes to see it: a dirt road paved with smooth, rounded white pebbles, like eggs. There were no signs or markers indicating where it led, but I was absolutely certain this was it.

The road wound its way through fields of wildflowers, wildflowers that shouldn't be blooming in late autumn. Their colors were too vibrant, too perfect—blues, purples, and reds, as if radiating an inner glow. My odometer ticked up: 1.2 miles, 3.5 miles, 5.8 miles, and 7.7 miles.

At the end of the road was a gate made of living wood—trees that had grown into an archway, their branches intertwined and lush. Through the archway, I saw a garden.

It was the most beautiful place I had ever seen. White gravel paths meandered through flowerbeds laden with fruit, past fruit-laden trees, and through vine-covered gazebos. The air was filled with the scents of jasmine and honeysuckle and a unique fragrance that reminded me of childhood summers, Christmas mornings, and all my fondest memories.

The path led me deeper into the garden, past roses that seemed to whisper, telling me something in a language I could almost understand, and past apple trees, where a gentle breeze rustled the branches, creating a crisp, bell-like sound. Everything here was brimming with life; unlike ordinary plants, they were sentient, they watched, and they welcomed me warmly.

In the center of the garden was an open space with a simple wooden table and two chairs. Standing there, tending to a cluster of white lilies, was a man.

He was ordinary in every way: of medium height, with brown hair, wearing work clothes, and with his fingernails stained with dirt and sawdust. But when he turned to look at me, his eyes were ancient and kind, filled with a sorrow that seemed to encompass the entirety of human history.

“Eric,” he said, his voice like a gentle stream, like a breeze rustling through leaves, like all the comforting sounds in the world. “It’s a pleasure to have you here. Please sit down. You’ve brought bread and wine, which is very kind of you. Would you like to share with me?”

I sat there, speechless. He gently took the bag from my hands, broke open the bread, and poured the wine into two wooden glasses that had appeared on the table.

“Eat,” he said. “Drink. You’re safe here.”

The bread tasted like every delicious meal I’d ever had. The wine was just right, warming my body and soul.

“You have many questions,” he said gently. “Everyone who comes here has questions. I may not be able to answer them all, but I will do my best.”

“Who are you?” I asked softly.

He smiled. “People have called me by many names. Gardener. Shepherd. Teacher. Friend. You can call me anything that makes you feel comfortable.”

“This is… I am…”

“Dead? No. This is a place between two worlds. It’s the end of all roads and the beginning of all paths. Every messenger eventually comes here, if they live long enough. It’s a blessing.”

He took a sip of his drink and looked at me with those ancient eyes.

“By the way, your mother was good. She wanted you to know. She understood why you couldn’t be with her until the end. The living have obligations to the living, and she never blamed you, not even for a moment.”

My throat tightened, and tears welled in my eyes.

“And Cookie…” he continued, and I gasped.

Cookie. My dog. That golden retriever I got on my fifth birthday slept at the foot of my bed every night until I was thirteen, when cancer took its life. It was my best friend from childhood, accompanying me through the difficult times of my parents' divorce and through every tough moment of my growing up.

“It’s here too,” the man said softly. “Would you like to see it?”

As if summoned, I heard the rustling of paws on the gravel and the eager panting of a happy animal. Then, Cookie skipped into the clearing, looking exactly as I remembered—young, healthy, and full of energy.

He ran straight to me, tail wagging wildly, his whole body swaying. I could see every detail of him: the white markings on his chest, the darker fur around his ears, and those warm brown eyes I had gazed into countless times.

“You can pet him if you want,” the man said. “He misses you.”

I reached out, my hand trembling slightly, longing to feel that soft fur again, to hear again the satisfied sigh he made when I scratched his ear.

Then I stopped.

The little booklet. Rule Seven: You may not touch anything handed to you unless it is food or drink handed to you directly.

My hand hovered in the air, just inches from the cookie's head. He looked up at me with those trusting eyes, his tail still wagging, not understanding why I wouldn't touch him.

""I can't,"" I choked out, ""the rules. I can't.""

The man looked at me, his eyes unreadable. ""You understand the rules exist with the point of being here?""

I shook my head, tears streaming down my cheeks. Cookie whimpered softly, seemingly confused by my rejection.

""Because this place is real, Eric. The garden is real, Cookie is real, and your mother is real, somewhere deep within the garden. But you don't belong here yet. You're still alive, still bound to the world of flesh and time. If you touch anything here, you establish a connection. A debt. And debts must be repaid.""

He stood up, Cookie sitting at his feet, still looking at me hopefully.

He walked to where I was sitting and placed his hand on my shoulder. His touch was warm and real.

""Your choice was wise. Even heartbroken, you followed the rules. That takes strength most people don't possess."" He smiled. ""You'll get through these three years, Eric. Not everyone can do it, but you certainly can."" Cookie stood up, walked back to me, and pressed his body against my leg. I struggled to restrain myself from touching it.

""I have to go,"" I choked out.

""I know. But before you go—"" He pulled a small leather collar with a brass tag from his pocket. cookie's collar. ""I can't give this to you. But I can give you a tip.""

He whistled, Cookie barked, and then turned and ran back into the woods along the path.

I stumbled through the garden, tears drying on my cheeks, the taste of bread and wine still lingering on my tongue. The door closed softly behind me.

No phone notification. No payment received. I didn't know what my tip was.

I returned home exhausted and slept soundly for the first time in days.

Until three days later, I sat in my apartment, staring blankly at my ever-present pocket watch, when I heard scratching at the door.

I cautiously... I cautiously opened the door, my heart pounding with anxiety, fearing some deliveryman might have brought something terrifying. After all, the last time had given me quite a fright.

But standing in the doorway was a dog.

A young, healthy Golden Retriever, about four months old. It had a white stripe down its back. The fur around its chest and ears was darker. It raised its head, looking at me with warm brown eyes, wagging its tail.

It looked exactly like Cookie.

A collar hung around its neck with a note attached: ""A grateful customer's tip.""""

Ugh, this dog—I'll still call him Cookie—made me feel better for about two weeks, then the dreams started getting worse. Not the delivery nightmares; I'd learned to isolate those nightmares, to archive them deep in my brain where I wouldn't touch them during the day. No, these dreams were different. They were fragmented and kaleidoscopic, with me standing in several places simultaneously, time shifting back and forth, hearing every thought of everyone I'd ever met, like overlapping radio stations playing in my head.

I'd been managing my condition with medication and psychotherapy, but lately, the line between manic lucidity and depressive fog was becoming increasingly blurred.

So I made a decision. Roy Dorman. My father. I hadn't spoken to him in eleven years. The last time I called him was because my mother died.

I was going to ask him what he was doing, or at least what he'd done wrong. I went to him. His address was in a once-prosperous part of the city; the apartment buildings were dilapidated, the windows of the corner shops were fitted with iron bars, and people in such places kept to themselves, each with their own secrets they didn't want others to discover. Let me preface this by saying my relationship with him wasn't good; he wasn't very sober even before his divorce. He drank, and then… To me, eleven years old, he was just a presence, no longer my father.

His apartment was on the third floor, the stairwell reeking of cigarette smoke and mildew. I stood outside his door for a full five minutes before finally knocking.

The person who opened the door looked decades older than he actually was. Roy Dorman was fifty-three but looked seventy. His hair was mostly gray, his face was wrinkled, and his hands trembled slightly—but I couldn't tell if it was from age, from the side effects of medication, or from withdrawal.

“Eric?” His voice was hoarse. “My God, Eric?”

“Hi, Dad.”

We looked at each other across the threshold, eleven years of silence filling the space between us.

“I… do you want to come in?” ""Sorry, the place is a mess; I didn't expect it—""

""I just wanted to talk,"" I said. ""Can we talk?""

He nodded and stepped aside. The apartment was small and cluttered, but not dirty. Newspapers were piled in the corner. A horse race was playing on the television, the volume muted. The walls were covered in sticky notes, and I realized then that they were reminders of things he needed to remember: take his medication. Pay rent. Eat lunch.

I recognized the system. I had something similar in my own apartment, except my reminders were to check the manual, follow the rules, and live well.

""You look good,"" he said, though we both knew it was a lie. I was thin, had dark circles under my eyes, and hadn't had a haircut in months. ""Anyway, better than me.""

""I've been working,"" I said. ""Actually, I'm doing pretty well.""

A strange look crossed his face. ""What kind of work?""

""Delivering takeout. Food delivery. The pay… not very unusual. But there are some conditions."" He was silent for a long time, then went to his kitchenette and poured two cups of coffee from a coffee pot that looked like it had been sitting there for hours. The coffee was bitter and burnt, but I drank it anyway.

“I used to deliver food,” he finally spoke. “After your mother and I divorced. After I messed up all my decent jobs because of… those bastards. Because of gambling. Because of all that.” He slumped heavily into an armchair held together with duct tape. “What was the company called back then? But the job was the same. Unfamiliar place. Unfamiliar customers. Those rules only make sense when they're broken.”

My coffee cup froze in mid-air.

“You worked for them?”

“Three years, like what you’re about to do. Earned enough to pay off debts, settle down, and start over.” He laughed, but the laughter was bitter. “Of course, after five years I gambled away most of my money. But it was all my fault; it had nothing to do with the job.” “The contract,” he continued, taking a sip of coffee. “You can’t talk about it. You can’t talk to people who haven’t worked there. Remember, those words vanish the moment they leave your mouth. But you… your eyes.” I looked around the room, checking for anything that shouldn’t be there. He took another sip of coffee. “You work for them now, so we can talk.”

I put down my cup, my hand trembling slightly. “Who’s your manager?”

“A guy named Marcus. A weirdo. Knows things he shouldn’t know. Laughs like a cat that’s eaten a canary.” Roy’s eyes became vacant. “Near the end of my three years, I asked him how long he’d been in this business. You know what he said?”

I shook my head.

“He said he’d been managing couriers since the days of the carriages. He said he’d witnessed the rise and fall of empires. He said for people like him, times were different—those who made certain choices accepted certain… promotions.”

The apartment suddenly felt small and cold.

“Marcus is still there,” I whispered. “He’s still my manager.”

Roy nodded slowly. “As far as I know, he’s been there for at least fifty years. Maybe longer.” He leaned forward. “Eric, listen to me. This job, it’s intoxicating. But it also makes us vulnerable.”

“Vulnerable to what?”

“Like them. Staying after three years. Accepting promotions, benefits, endless work.” He grabbed my wrist, unusually firmly. 

“Promise me one thing. Promise me that after three years, you’ll leave. Take your money, run, and never look back.”

“Dad…”

“Promise me, Eric. The eleven years I’ve spent with you have been because I couldn’t control myself, because I let my inner demons prevail. Don’t let those inner demons prevail either. Three years. Not a day more.”

I gently pulled his hand away. “I promise.”""

We talked for another hour. He told me stories of his deliveries, of a mansion where each room corresponded to a different season, of a lighthouse that guided ships that sank a century ago, and of a library where books rewrote themselves as you read. These stories might have sounded absurd to others, but I understood them completely.

As I left, he hugged me, and I could feel how vulnerable he had become. That was about a year and a half ago, when I decided to start taking medication.

Cookies were waiting for me in the car. As I drove away, I saw my father standing in the apartment window through the rearview mirror, watching me leave.

The pocket watch in my pocket buzzed. This couldn't be."" It was just a pocket watch, but now everything was more than just a pocket watch. I opened it and found the photograph had changed. The photograph showed my father and me standing in his apartment, but now there was a third figure standing behind us. He was tall, his face blurred.

I found Marcus in the warehouse office. He was flipping through some documents that looked like they were written in an ancient language that predates writing. As I walked in, he looked up, a wide, overly bright smile revealing too many teeth. This time, he wasn't pretending to be an ordinary man.

“Eric, how can I help?”

I closed the door behind me and sat down without waiting for an invitation. “My father used to work for you.”

“Ah, Roy Dorman. Yes, I remember him. He was a good messenger, mostly following the rules. He had some…inner demons, but who doesn’t?” Marcus put down his pen. I noticed the pen looked like it was made of bone. “You’ve seen him.” “How come you…” I stopped. I wanted to say, how come you’ve lived so long? What a stupid question. “He said you’ve been in this business a long time.”

“Really?” Marcus leaned back in his chair. “And what do you think, Eric?”

“I think the manual says I shouldn’t say the word ‘resign’ to you. But it doesn’t say I can’t talk about work. Talk about how long you’ve been here. Talk about what kind of person you are.”

Marcus’s smile widened. “A keen eye. You, the Dorman family, have always been clever. You know, your great-uncle also worked for us. That was in 1923. He held on for two years and three months, then tried to escape. Of course, we eventually found him. The contract was valid.”

I felt a chill. “What happened to him?”

“He became part of our collection. We always have a use for those who break contracts.” Marcus stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the warehouse floor. “But you won’t run away, right, Eric? You’ll follow the rules, serve your full three years, and then make your choice.”

“What choice?”

“The same choice I made seven hundred and forty-three years ago, or you won’t have a choice at all.” He turned to face me, and in that instant, I saw his true face—something ancient, patient, utterly inhuman, cloaked in the skin of a middle-aged man. “Leave with your sealed memories and silent tongue, return to the normal world… or stay. Accept the promotion. Become part of this machine.”

“Ah, you have an order,” he said to me. I glanced at it; there really was one—to the zoo.",9,1764244514.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Is anyone else genuinely feeling a bit lonely—and would like to connect? 💛 I’m 25F and not originally from Liverpool so don’t have many friends or family around, so it would be really lovely to build some genuine connections.

I have a girl group back home and would love to have one here, just missing them so much in times like these.

I’ve tried meeting people on here before, and while some have been kind, it often doesn’t go beyond one meetup. I’d really love to find people who are open to something a bit more consistent—whether it’s going for a walk or picnic, grabbing coffee, having a cosy movie night !

I already attend girls on the go events but most aren't my taste however I'm still persisting as it's a good way to meet people ... open to other ideas  :)

A lot of SG creators who used to post loud, colourful, super energetic stuff are suddenly going for this soft, calm vibe instead. Warm lighting, slow music, beige outfits, clean rooms, gentle routines, the whole thing feels like everyone collectively switched to “quiet mode.”
It’s like the edits got slower, the colours got warmer, and the whole mood just became softer. Even people who used to be all about chaotic humour are now posting slow vlogs of them making coffee or cleaning their room with some dreamy soundtrack in the background. The videos look nice, but the shift happened so fast that it’s hard not to notice.
Maybe it’s just the trend right now, or maybe creators are tired and just want to put out calmer stuff. Whatever it is, SG content feels a lot more mellow and aesthetic lately like everyone’s trying to create a little pocket of peace on their feed.",1,1764244320.0,SingaporeInfluencers,1,0.67,False

I'm looking for a quick and easy machine for beginners. I'm currently Nespresso owner - happy with it, but I feel like the capsules are expensive and create a lot of waste. On Black Friday, I saw some espresso machines and wanted to buy one. I drink lattes/cappuccinos 90% of the time, and my husband drinks French press coffee + manual coffee grinder. I don't want to get too into it as a hobby. I just want my coffee to brew quickly and without too much fuss, but still to have an acceptable quality. Plus, it's important for me that machine won't be broken after 1-2 years. I'm also going to switch portafilter with a bottomless one. Machines that are on sale:

1. Delonghi EM450.M (the most attractive option in terms of appearance and price, but as I understand it, the slanted ears on the portafilter are not at all universal)  
  
2. Delonghi Dedica Style / Duo (version with or without Cold Brew how useful do you think this feature is)?

3. De'Longhi Stilosa EC.235

4. Breville Barista SLIMLINE

5. WMF Lumero

6. PortoAlegre CJ-281C1

7. Breville Barista Max (with a coffee grinder, in which case I won't buy a separate one, which is not ideal as I read here in subreddit)

I'd like to spend around €300-350 on the machine incl. a grinder, most likely electric. I know it's not the best budget for it, but my requirements are also not mega high I'm in Germany.

P.S. I don't rule out that someday I'll get hooked and want to upgrade, so ideally I want to leave some flexibility and theoretical possibility for that here.",1,1764244173.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I just feel so lost.,"The title seems a bit dramatic but I just really feel unsure how to present my application and if I should even attempt to apply to certain schools. I think for mine, my context is hugely important. Here are my stats and context-

CONTEXT:

Ngl There is a lot and I'm quite unsure on what I should leave in and out of my application. Some is vague for privacy.

I am an Indian male and my families income is kinda weird rn due to ongoing court issues, but upper middle class? (thankfully, we are doing ok)

Throughout my life, my dad slowly became an alcoholic and became abusive (mostly emotional) at home. Over the years, it kept getting worse and worse, but as a young child, I kinda got used to it. Cops would start getting involved and stuff etc. During Covid, they had a fight and my mom had finally had enough and she left the house and took us along (previously had done some similar stuff, but it was always temporary). I went to a relative's house and she went to a shelter, and after that, we eventually went from shitty apartment to apartment. I failed out of 7th grade from my magnet school during online covid times because I had become very overwhelmed with life and just always tried to distract myself with other stuff like YT etc. I ended up back at my old PWI private school and it was quite a different environment for me. I was the only Indian kid and felt a disconnect between my culture, as I would always get questioned on it. I made friends ofc and stuff, but I always would stick out, especially since it was a small grade (80ish) and everyone knows each other. Academics were not as high standard as my old magnet school. ANYWAYS, in the middle of trying to “divorce” and an ongoing court case, my dad passed away suddenly in India my freshman year. I went on an emergency trip to India for the funeral. This obv messed me up, esp how contradicting i felt cuz he was a good person who was influenced by the bad making him a bad person who treated us like shit. My grades however didnt really start dipping til like junior year, where my course load was much higher (5 aps), and this is when i started photography as well. But overall throughout these years, I had a lot of extra responsibilities at home especially as my mom was constantly under stress and trying to manage our financial situation with the court case. I have a younger sister, which i would like drive around and tutor etc.

TLDR: basically grew up with an alcoholic father who mostly emotionally abused my family, we tried to separate from him during covid, and then he died freshman year. Throughout all of this (all my life really) ive had extra responsibilities for my mom and younger sis

Academics

\-4.0 weighted GPA and around 3.5-3.6

unweighted \~ not great Ik :(

\- 31 super score ACT (will be taking the Dec test and aiming for a 33-34+ to offset gpa)

\- 10 APs and 6 honors (AP World, APHUG, APUSH, AP Precal, AP Psych, AP Lang, AP Chem, AP Calculus AB, AP Physics, AP Lit)

For context my grades especially junior year were the worst due to me falling into severe depression (and I know I shouldn't put that on my application cuz they might see it as a liability)-

ACTIVITIES:

My ""spike""? I'm a photographer with freelance photography business mostly does sports (for my school and anybody else). Won some awards (Scholastic Silver Key, 1st in ""\[My State\]'s"" National Fair). I have also volunteered a lot (about 100+ hours) for photos esp for my nearby temple and community events.

* Founder and president of photography club (two years, around 35+ people) and gaming club (we do clubs weird and its very limited)
* Student ambassador (interview process)

* Other stuff- SGA, Science Bowl (we actually have jack shit for STEM ecs at our school, no robotics, no science olympiad, and science bowl is just for “fun”)
* Part time job at publix 

Now here are the schools im applying to: 

Target/Safety: Auburn, UGA, UF, UCF

Reaches and kinda “dream” schools: Duke & Northwestern, Stanford & Yale

Other: UPenn, USC, UMich, Vandy, WF

Here is the tricky part, I wanna do engineering. But applying to Duke or NU, with engineering is difficult and I am wondering, since they are generally more flexible (like Stanford and Yale), if I should apply and start off with something like statistical science and get some STEM classes out the way and transfer into engineering. Another reason i like Duke a lot is the sports scene, so i can find a way to continue sports photography.

Reason for engineering is that I want to have more of a genuine impact to help others (and its cool asf). If it doesn't work out for me, I will do fine in business and attend graduate school for that.

Im not too sure on what ""story"" i want my AOs to see, and for my personal statment, should i write about my dad or not, or should i keep him and the other context/responsibilities in additional info. I want to avoid being cliché.

Sometimes I wish I had started earlier, esp with my ECs. One of my worries is that everything has been done mostly in junior year and this senior year, and that the officers might not like that and see it as ""fake.""

I genuinely feel like a failure and just wish I did stuff earlier, but I couldnt cuz life and my mom. It really hurts seeing all these other kids and their parents talk about college, and although my mother is not stupid by any means, its just hard explaining all this to her. She's still happy and proud of me that I can still go to my safety for engineering (Auburn). Idk if its my ego, but i just wanna be that typa guy that gets into a prestigious college and makes good global connections yk? Like, am I completely delusional to even attempt Yale or Stanford?? :(

I hope this is not weird or bad to post on this Reddit, and thank you in advance for helping me. Sorry if this seems like a ""venting"" post.",2,1764244049.0,ApplyingToCollege,3,1.0,False

This is super long so I’m sorry for anyone who actually read all this. Also this was written at 6am when I just woke up so I may be all over…. 

Before getting started, I’m in a limo business where the hourly regulations that CDL drivers easily gets ignored unfortunately. Locations and dates will be changed so that I can keep a little bit of privacy for all parties involved. 

Received a job on Monday for a Wednesday evening pick up at 7:30pm. The drive is 8 hours away. Company tells me that the vehicle that they requested is available all day Tuesday for me to take and plan accordingly. My plan was to leave Tuesday afternoon around 6pm, arrive to the city of the pick up at around 2-3am, get a hotel, sleep and rest before needing to drive back with clients at 7:30 the next day. 

On Tuesday, I was told that the vehicle is NOT free and that it has been assigned for another job. So now I’m sort of forced to wait for it to be done. It finally gets done at around 11pm so now it’s either I leave asap with it, or leave in the morning. Morning sounded worse as if I leave at 5-6am, I’ll get there at around 2pm, can only rest for 5 hours before needing to drive back with clients for another 8 hours or more with stops. So I leave at 11pm, get to the city of pick up at around 8:30am as I needed to make stops as I was tired. Now at this point, I’ve been up for over 24 hours as I woke up at 6am on Tuesday. 

Once I’m there, I start looking for hotels. Reason why I start looking for hotels now is because I didn’t know how long I was able to drive before needing to really stop. I have gotten hotel rooms plenty of times in the morning and check in early. Plan was to be in the hotel by around 10am and sleep till 6pm or so and get ready for the return trip at 7:30pm. I found a hotel after few hotels telling me that it was busy the night before so no early check in is available. So I was willing to wait till about 11am at the hotel parking lot. 

Now this is where it gets interesting. At 10:30am, I get a text from dispatcher that the job has been changed to 3pm. Apparently the booker asked my dispatcher if I spent the night in the city and if I’m able to change to the earlier pick up. My dispatcher just saw the gps and saw that I was here, didn’t bother asking me if I had any rest nor if I’m ok for the earlier pick up. His initial text to me was “job has been changed to 3pm”. Meaning he confirmed it with the booker already. Right? 

I text back furiously telling him that I haven’t had any sleep yet, I’m still waiting for the hotel room to be ready, and that he should have asked me first before confirming anything with the booker and the new time change. Dispatcher just says well what should he do then? What should he tell the booker? I tell him nothing at this point as he already confirmed and that it will look extremely bad for the company I’m with if we need to change BACK to the original time because I need to sleep. (Yeah.. stupid of me.. I should have just slept). Now the hotel room gets ready at noon, I go in, take a shower, change, figure out where to get gas, coffee, snacks to get ready for this dreadful and dangerous ride back. 

I get to the pick up location at 2:45pm and I text the clients and I hear nothing back until 4pm that they’re on their way back to the hotel and that when they get back, they’ll run up to the hotel to pick up their bags and come back down shortly. They get back to the hotel at 5pm, and tells me they’re brb. Now it’s 7pm. I tell my boss that I don’t think I can make this job anymore. I’ve been up for more than 37 hours and that the dispatcher should have never confirmed etc. instead of my boss looking out for me, he starts bitching at me saying that I should have slept, I got here at 8:30am and wtf did I do until 3pm etc. now I’m even more pissed and tell him off and how he messed up by assigning the car on Tuesday when he told me to take it whenever to plan accordingly, plus how the dispatch messed up and that I was willing to still do it at 3pm to look out for him so that the booker do not complain. We argue for a good 30 min with my boss not backing down and basically calling me an idiot for planning so poorly and that it’s my fault for not sleeping. I straight up tell him that if I get in to an accident because of this on the way back, I’m not liable for this. 

8pm the group calls me and says theyre coming down still and they do and put some bags in the sprinter but we still need to wait for more. I’m falling asleep at this point. Because they’re constantly telling me that the main person is coming down, I can’t even sleep in the driver seat obviously. Even if they didn’t, it’s not the most comfortable way to sleep. Finally at 11pm we are ready to leave. I tell the booker that I don’t think I can make this drive and the booker just says “oh no please drive carefully”….. 

3:30am I fall asleep on a bend on the highway and sideswipe the guardrail. Thankfully no one was hurt. The people were pissed but I was even more pissed that they had me wait basically leave 8-9 hours later than their new earlier time just to leave even later than the original time. Somehow make it back and the job is finished. 

Now my boss is asking me what should we do about the cost of the damage? I tell him I’m not paying anything for it. Absolutely not. Especially when he assigned the car the day before after telling me it won’t and I was forced to leave late at night, his dispatcher approving an earlier time without even asking me, and when I told him at 7pm that I don’t think I can make this drive, instead of him telling the booker this job is no longer able to go because of all the changes plus the extra wait time etc, he just bitched at me asking why I didn’t sleep and all. 

Am I in the wrong on this? Yes I should have just think of my life and my well beings and flat out decline the job once things changed. But tried to do what’s best for the company and now I have to pay for it. Well I’m not paying for it after standing my ground. Obviously boss is pissed about it (well is it obvious? Does he even have a reason to be pissed?) do I have any legal grounds to stand on? I mean obviously i was already way over my regulated hours “if we actually follow it….”

Here’s the experiment I ran:

* Brewed **1 large coffee**, max coffee strength, **100 ml water** setting.
* Result:
   * **10 ml** of water in the drip tray (from inside the machine)
   * **103 ml** of coffee in the cup
* After turning the machine off:
   * **11 ml** of water came out of the brew dispenser into a cup
   * **14 ml** of water in the drip tray (from inside the machine)

The puck bin is dry. So in total, there’s some extra water in the tray and a little from the spout after shutdown.

Is this normal? I’m suspecting it is, since the amount of coffee in the cup is pretty much what I asked for. I’m coming from a DeLonghi machine where there was never any water in the tray, so this feels different.

The stacks, doors, really all the moving parts, have a looseness about them that I don’t remember the OG having (granted that was a looooooong time ago).

Plus the helmet for Bruce Sato was really tight going on. I just saw where the stickers were not the right size but I have not had the chance to check those out.

> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> This is the history of coffee, the second most traded commodity in the world. Like any other good story, there are legends and myths involved. It is said that coffee was first brewed in Ethiopia and from there it travelled to Yemen and then to the rest of the world.

There was once a goat-herder called Kaldi, who lived in the Ethiopian plateau in the ninth century. Kaldi started noticing the high energy of his goats after they had eaten some berries. They got so invigorated that they would not sleep at night. Kaldi related this to the abbot of his local monastery. That gentleman had the fantastic idea of boiling the berries and making a drink, imbibing which kept him alert throughout the long hours of evening prayer. The benefits of these amazing berries spread to other monasteries and from there to Arabia. So the legend goes.

&nbsp;

_Coffee berries_

&nbsp;

In another story, a Moroccan Sufi mystic observed birds eating berries from a tree and noticed their unusual vitality. He tried them and found that they made him equally alert.

Or perhaps it was the above-mentioned mystic’s disciple Omar, whose home was in Mocha (modern day Yemen) from where he was in exile – living in the desert. Mocha is also where we get the name for the drink! He tried some berries to alleviate his hunger and found them bitter, so he boiled them and drank the beverage, which invigorated him and allowed him to stay awake through the night. When news spread of this miracle drink, Omar was allowed to return to Mocha and was thenceforth considered a saint.

&nbsp;

Whether any one of these stories is true we cannot say, what is beyond doubt is that from Ethiopia and then Yemen that miracle drink – coffee – spread first throughout Arabia and then the world. Perhaps more than any other beverage, coffee has been right at the centre of world history ever since the consumption of that first cup.

Muslim pilgrims from across the globe, while on their way to Mecca, boosted its reputation, and it became known as the ‘wine of Araby’. It seems that Yemeni merchants brought home the coffee plants from Ethiopia, and coffee cultivation properly began on the Arabian Peninsula, specifically in Yemen, by the 15<sup>th</sup> century. Yemeni Sufis used it to sharpen their concentration for their night-time devotions. Muslims consumed it during Ramadan to stay awake and pray during the night. By the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it had found aficionados in Persia, Egypt, Syria and Turkey, not only consumed in homes but also in public coffee houses known as _qahveh khaneh._

&nbsp;

The story continues with Baba Budan. Before him, countries purchased coffee from Yemen, which guarded the beans and seedlings. Baba Budan was a Sufi saint from India, travelling to Mecca in 1670. And this legend says that he smuggled some beans into India on his way back. Thus began South Indian coffee cultivation, which continues to this day.

Side note: _Qahvah_ was the original term for wine in Yemen and coffee also began to be called that. It later became _kahveh_ in Turkish, Koffie in Dutch and finally coffee in English. Initially, the berry was boiled or fermented to make the drink. It was not until the 13<sup>th</sup> century that beans started to be roasted

Its popularity was unequal to any other drink in the Muslim world. Coffee houses frequented by everyone of note become bustling social and intellectual hubs. However, Muslims did not always accept the beverage. It was banned (considered _haram_ or sinful) in Mecca in the early 16<sup>th</sup> century because the Governor associated it with revolution and sedition. The Ottoman Sultan finally lifted the ban 13 years later. In 1532, there was a similar ban in Egypt.

The stories of the dark bean travelled to Europe. After the Siege of Malta in 1565, captured Turkish slaves, presumably, made coffee as their traditional beverage, popularising it in Malta. Coffee houses started to open in the country.

&nbsp;

In 1570, coffee arrived in Venice due to trade with North Africa, initially regarded with suspicion and fear, some calling it the “bitter invention of Satan”.&nbsp; Even the clergy condemned its use, until Pope Clement VIII tasted it in 1615 and gave his approval because he found it so satisfying. Despite the mistrust, coffee houses started popping up not only as places to find the beverage but also as social and communication centres, just as they had been in the Muslim world.

Another legend relates how coffee was introduced into Vienna, Austria, as spoils of war after the defeat of the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. A Polish officer received coffee beans left behind by the Turks, opened a coffee house and popularized the drink – as well as the custom of adding milk and sugar. Not sure how true this is but it is a great story.

&nbsp;

From here, coffee found its way into England, France, Germany and Holland. And the social revolution followed it. In England, coffee houses came to be known as ‘penny universities’ because for a penny you could get a refreshing beverage and engage in intellectual conversation. Up to this time, the popular breakfast beverages were beer and wine. Coffee soon replaced them because consumers found themselves alert and energized in the morning. Intellectuals, artists and academics of the time found coffee houses a source of current thinking and news. By1675, there were more than 3,000 coffee houses throughout the country.

&nbsp;

But women were excluded and in 1674, this resulted in a Women’s Petition Against Coffee.

The Dutch obtained live coffee trees in 1616 from Mocha, Yemen and planted them in the Botanical gardens, where they thrived. These bushes produced what came to be known as [_Coffea Arabica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica). [_Coffea Robusta_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora) is from central and western sub-Saharan Africa. The Dutch started cultivating coffee in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1658 and then moved the plantations to Java, Indonesia, monopolising the production nd growing global trade of coffee. They brought the drink to New Amsterdam (later New York) but tea remained the drink of choice in the New World until the Boston Tea Party in 1773.

&nbsp;

A young naval officer took a seedling from King Louis XIV’s plant in the Paris Botanical gardens (given to the King by the Mayor of Amsterdam) and brought it to Martinique in 1723, where he planted them and they thrived. That seedling is credited with the spread of over 18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique in the next 50 years. And that’s not it. That same seedling was the parent of all coffee trees in the Caribbean, Central and South America. Brazilian coffee started growing in 1727 and took off after the country’s independence in 1825.

Humans are mobile and as they travelled, whether as tourists, conquerors or colonists, they carried coffee seeds all over the world. Coffee was planted all over the world and economies were established on coffee trade. By the 18<sup>th</sup> century, it became the most profitable export crop.

Today, coffee is the second most traded good after oil. Brazil is the greatest producer of coffee in the world, producing almost one-third of global coffee. Many coffee-making apparatuses were invented along the way. Mass production and sale of coffee began in 1871, started by John Arbukle. Maxwell house popularised instant coffee in 1886. In the 1900’s the Brazilian government asked Nestle to figure out how to utilize the country’s coffee waste. And presto! We got freeze-dried coffee called Nescafe, the world’s leading brand today. The 1960s saw another coffee revolution and in the 1970s Starbucks opened, initially only selling coffee beans.

&nbsp;

Coffee plantations have an impact on the environment because it requires the clearing of large swathes of land and extensive water use. Now, fair-trade and organic coffee are becoming popular as a result.

Being a part of social, cultural and intellectual change, coffee took over the world. There is nothing quite like it and that’s one addiction worth the trouble.

1p803di,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1p803di/my_childhood_bicycle_keeps_killing_people/,My childhood bicycle keeps killing people,"I had just turned five years old when my mother was flattened by a truck. A wayward rock on the pavement sent me flying over the handlebars of my newly gifted red glittery bicycle. Even the stabilizers could not save me from the crash. As I toppled over and scrapped my exposed skin raw and bloody the poor bicycle rolled across the road before coming to a stop. My mother saw the whole event from where she watched from on our porch. While I wailed she went over to retrieve the bicycle. The driver of the hulking truck suffered from narcolepsy but had not informed his employer. I stopped crying when I was forced to stare at the flattened corpse of her, the bicycle she had been carrying was crumpled and embedded into the flesh of her destroyed centre mass.



When I was ten years old there was a pair of siblings that enjoyed tormenting me. Even now I do not understand why I became the target of their cruel acts. In a quiet alley on a sunny afternoon they beat me bloody. They were five years older than me and I was certain that they intended to kill me this time. My pleading and cries did not halt their kicks and punches but the shrill ringing of a bicycle bell did. It stood there as it had on my birthday morning catching the golden sunlight across its sparkling body. The thing moved into the alley on its own, the pedals and wheels turning as if by an invisible child. Both the tormenting siblings simply stood and watched as the bicycle advanced stupified by the mystical sight. Then the chains had snapped from the bicycle’s sides and snatched around the siblings' ankles. Together they were pulled towards the waiting red glittering thing. They reached for me, their eyes full of fear as if they expected me to help them. Pinning them down the bicycle mounted one then the other and spun its front wheel into the back of my bully’s head. The whirlwind speed of the wheel carved their skulls apart and splattered gore across the alley wall and floors. After they died their horrible deaths I got up and walked around their corpses knowing somehow that the bicycle would not harm me.



It carried on much the same. My stepmother was a drunk who beat on my dad but doted on me with a fascinating desperation. That developed into a terrifying obsession. She waited until I was barely a man before trying to take me for herself. My small father was out of town on business when I returned from school to find four empty wine bottles on the kitchen table. The woman lay waiting for me in my bed. I ran but she caught up with me and pressed her putrid lips against mine. Then from just behind the front door came the ringing of a bicycle bell. It dragged the horrible woman out by her ankles and I never saw her again.



At college I had a girlfriend who cheated on me with a close friend. It was a bitter experience to live through but not world ending. The bicycle disagreed. Newscasters couldn’t get enough of the sight of their two disemboweled bodies hanging from the football goal posts. The police asked me questions but my alibi was watertight. They asked me who I thought could have done this and I did not explain who I knew for certain had done it. Then my poor roommate pulled a harmless prank involving feathers and tape. I had even found it funny. He was found splattered across the highway. A girl at a coffee shop was clearly having a bad day and snapped a harsh remark at me. I felt no resentment towards her and stared at the TV screen when it was announced that her top half and lower half were found in two different towns.



I dropped out of college and took up a job in a convenience store. That was a terrible idea. Members of the public would vent their frustrations at me, drunks would try and take things without paying and such. People stopped coming when the bodies started piling up and the store shut down. It would have been easy to turn towards booze but my deceased stepmother put me off the stuff for life. Instead I drifted between jobs but the only kind I could get involved the general public in some capacity. A bumped shoulder was enough to warrant evisceration. Eventually I simply stayed shut in my crap accommodation and refused to go outside. Money dwindled, so did food. Nearing the end of my resources there was a ringing from outside my door. There were two plastic bags sitting there. One filled with cash and the other with food. I could make out faint bicycle tracks on the hallway carpet.



Now I stay indoors occupying myself with electronic devices and books. I pay my rent on time and food shows up at my door when I need it. It is safer this way. For everyone. I suppose that is what my mother would have wanted.

Hope everyone is doing well :)

A strange one I thought I'd post up for the one other person who's in a similar situation as me and stands to benefit from this. Before proceeding though, a warning that there will be disturbingly dirty coffee equipment pictured in this post, in the name of science (and I wasn't there to clean things)!

So the background is we're privileged enough to have a Linea Mini at work that apparently no-one else cares about at all. Nor does anyone know how to make coffee, nor to flush the grouphead after using, nor clean the machine, nor even to wipe coffee grounds off the bench that they've spilled - you get the idea. I work for the organization on a varying shift pattern, so I'm not there all the time to be able to clean the machine/do what I can and so one of the ways I was trying to minimize the damage in my absence was to see if there was a way to reduce the build-up on the shower screen between my ability to clean it. I'd seen online that theoretically the IMS screens have less build-up, but I haven't seen anything online where anyone has conclusively said so, so enter this post.

I was conveniently (or inconveniently) going to be away from work for about 6 days, so I decided to use the time to set up a very loose science experiment comparing the build-up on each of the screens after 6 days of use by the heathens I work with. The TLDR is in my opinion the IMS screens have less build up and also clean better when back flushed with water without removing the screen - the coffee is also noticeably less bitter/burnt with that build-up present so it does seem to keep the machine slightly cleaner.

Here are some images below to show you the results - it's worth noting that this is the non-coated screen that IMS offers, not the Nano Quartz screen (MA200NT) as I figured that coating would be destroyed by the heathens immediately.

[Shiny new IMS screen - a single piece without the multi-layering of the Factory LM screen, which will hopefully reduce build-up.](https://preview.redd.it/u6bwbo2mdl3g1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d2297e0a59e09e7de0ae3f211e921085f1fe24e)

[This is the IMS screen after 6 days of build-up - again pretty gross, but from this angle it looks thicker than it actually is - notice the edges which are less black than the factory screen \(less built up\)](https://preview.redd.it/97343n6xdl3g1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79e8e58919827f7086bcba5e535f385133c4a748)

[Here's the side on view where you can see a lot better how much thinner the build up actually is - it still needs to be cleaned \(which it was\) but it does have less build up than the factory screen, and the coffee does taste a bit better.](https://preview.redd.it/s0krdo6xdl3g1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f750213ba4d02acda867cfccc2935f46ebd263a0)

Hopefully this may be useful to someone in a similar predicament - I imagine it would again be a work machine where someone thinks about using one of these screens for this purpose, I don't think any of us on the sub would treat our home machines like this! :,)",1,1764243358.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False

I keep seeing super clean transitions everywhere the quick outfit flips, the hand-over-camera jump cuts, the way they switch scenes so smoothly. It used to be just simple clips, but now even a basic “get ready with me” looks like they spent real time planning the shots.
You can tell people are actually practising the moves, setting up their phones properly, repeating the same action a few times just to get that perfect cut. Even normal stuff like pouring coffee or packing a bag suddenly looks extra smooth because of how they’re stitching it together.
It’s funny because the videos still feel casual, but the editing is on another level. Feels like everyone quietly decided to level up at the same time. It's cool to watch, but also like… wow, everyone’s becoming a mini filmmaker these days.",2,1764243296.0,SingaporeInfluencers,0,1.0,False

Chapter One

The Drift

As one of many, it floated through the void. No eyes to see the stars it drifted past. No ears to hear the rushing silence of the darkscape around it. It knew only hunger — the eternal pull toward the distant scent of radiation that drew its colony onward.

Gentle rays grazed its surface, guiding it toward the burning ball of fire and gas ahead. The creatures fed from it, each one swelling with the promise of those great bursts of energy streaming across the expanse of space.

When it drifted close enough, it flared, swelling to catch as much cosmic radiation as it could. All around it, others did the same, crowding, jostling, competing for the thickest bursts of heat and waves.

This one was pushed aside.

Shunted from the feeding mass, it drifted into quieter space, left to hunt the smaller, less desirable trails. Still, it followed a pulse — faint, rhythmic, beckoning — and chased it into the dark.

Then came the dense burst.

A wave crashed across its tiny form, hurling it through space. Spinning. Rolling. Flung by explosive force. It drifted faster and faster, momentum building beyond anything it had ever known.

A shockwave hit.

Pressure crushed it inward, tumbling it through a pull of magnetic force until — warmth.

Gradients bent. Currents twisted. Winds unlike anything in its experience pummeled its surface.

Atmosphere. Water vapour. Oxygen. Hydrogen. Unknown chemicals coating its skin.

It plunged through cold skies until it collided with something soft and weak — a warm biological core.

Its body trembling from the impact, it crawled. It wrapped itself around the first cluster of cells it found, burrowing deeper, seeking the thrum of energy beneath layers of flesh and bone.

There. A pulse. A rhythm.

It coiled around it and rested.

It slept and fed, tiny and fragile, moulding itself to the new environment. Slowly, quietly, it began to grow.

ONE WEEK EARLIER

Craig is working at an older boomers house, the old bloke there is drinking a cup of tea while hovering around and sticky beaking everything Crasig does, an old dishwasher blew the fuse on the house, so Craigs been called out to fix it. Craig is polite, barely, grunts and yeps to the boomer while the old boy bitches about the government, and the news, etc. the radio is on in the blokes house with talk back about this upcoming solar flare, supposedly biggest one in over 100 years, youll be able to see the auroa borealis from melbourne, it may cause power outtages the voice on the radio says, Craig pays no heed. he slaps the circuit board close, haggles with the old boy about how it only took him 10 minuites so he shuold have to pay the call out fee, Craig groans, and threatens to undo all the work and to get another bloke out to fix it then.

The fuse box was older than Craig, and not ageing gracefully. The metal casing rattled every time he touched it, like it was offended he’d dared to open it. Somewhere behind him, the old bloke who owned the place slurped loudly at a cup of tea, breathing down Craig’s neck as if supervision might somehow improve the quality of the work.

“It all went out at once,” the man said for the third time. “Bloody dishwasher. I told Marilyn not to trust newfangled machines.”

Craig grunted. “Yep.”

He had half his arm inside the fuse panel, headlamp strapped around his forehead, dust creeping into his mouth every time he breathed in. The house smelled like stale biscuits and disinfectant. Every surface was either floral, knitted, or beige.

“You’d think for what they cost, they’d bloody work,” the old man muttered. “Nothing works anymore. Not the government, not the infrastructure. All going to shit.”

Craig flicked a switch and tested the line. “Mm.”

The radio on the benchtop crackled with talkback callers — the kind of voices that sounded like they’d been permanently angry since the late seventies.

“…and the Bureau says this solar storm’ll be the biggest we’ve had in a hundred years,” the announcer said. “City might even lose power. Aurora visible from Melbourne if conditions hold.”

The old man snorted. “Aurora borealis, here? Rubbish. Bloody media scare tactics. Next they’ll say it’s the end of the world.”

Craig ignored it. Sun storms, weather warnings, whatever — it was all just noise. He’d lived through enough “once in a lifetime events” to know half of them were bullshit and the other half were exaggerated to sell ads.

He snapped the circuit breaker into place and slammed the panel closed. “Right. Try the dishwasher.”

The old man shuffled over and jabbed the button. Lights flickered, the machine whirred back to life, and the man nodded as if Craig had finally done something useful.

“Ten minutes that took,” the bloke said, squinting at his watch. “Can’t see why you tradies charge so much for—”

Craig cut him off with a look. “Mate. You want the lights back on or not?”

“I’m just saying, it was barely ten minutes.”

“I can undo it,” Craig offered, deadpan. “Call someone else. They’ll take thirty minutes and charge you triple.”

The old man harrumphed into his tea.

Craig held out his hand. “Call-out fee.”

“It’s robbery.”

“Yep,” Craig said, “but your dishwasher works.”

The old man reluctantly fished out his wallet. Craig took the cash, tucked it into his shirt pocket, and grabbed his tool bag.

As he stepped outside, the late-afternoon sun was swallowed by thick, icy clouds — the kind that promised a cold snap. He didn’t notice the faint shimmer in the sky or the slight static on his skin. The storm was still days away.

He only noticed how good it felt to get out of that house.

He walked down the path to his van, thinking about which pub meal he’d trade tonight’s job for, flicking the radio on as he drove off.

Talkback callers shouted over each other, arguing about solar storms, radiation bursts, auroras, and whether everyone should stock up on candles.

Craig rolled his eyes, flicked on some new band he heard on a podcast last night, and lit a cigarette at a red light.

Just weather, he thought.

Just another week.

Nothing extraordinary.

It was a twenty-five minute drive home, long enough to be bored but not long enough for a podcast, so Craig hit call on the only bloke he ever rang without thinking twice.

Darren answered mid-word, voice bursting through Craig’s speakers like he’d been waiting for a reason to stop working.

“Hey, dickhead!” Darren shouted. “How’re ya goin’?” Craig could hear typing in the background — frantic, pointless, the soundtrack of a job Craig didn’t understand and didn’t want to. Something with blockchain or AI or crypto or meta-data—Darren had explained it once, got two sentences in, and Craig had told him to shut up before his brain starting leaking out his ear.

“Daz, mate, it’s four o’clock,” Craig said, flicking his blinker on. “I’m heading to the Mote for a beer and a parma. Thursday’s usually got a good band on. You free?”

It was their routine. Had been for years. If Craig was at the Mote on a Thursday night, you could assume Darren wasn’t far behind — cycling over after work, showing up in a sweat-wicking gym tee like a bloke who’d escaped a hostage situation at F45.

There was a pause on the line, just a beat too long.

Craig frowned. “You alive?”

“Yeah, yeah,” Darren replied, the typing stopping at last. “Just… buried in a sprint cycle. Product launch next week. Boss is riding my arse.”

Craig smirked. “Sounds like a you problem.”

“Shut up.”

“So you comin’ or what?” Craig said.

Another small pause. Craig could hear Darren’s girlfriend saying something in the background, too soft to make out, followed by Darren muffling the mic with his hand.

When he came back on, his voice had shifted — lighter, rehearsed, like he’d switched masks.

“Maybe,” Darren said. “Depends when I get out. Might swing by after dinner.”

Craig nodded even though Darren couldn’t see him. “Alright. First round’s on you, ya corporate sellout.”

“Yeah, yeah,” Darren laughed. “Oi, don’t get too smashed before I get there.”

“No promises.”

They ended the call with the usual insults — friendly, sharp, comfortable — and Craig tossed his phone onto the passenger seat.

He cracked the window. The cold air stung his cheeks. Traffic hummed along the freeway. The sky above the city looked normal — grey clouds, a smear of dusk, a hint of winter settling in.

Nothing extraordinary.

Craig rolled into Fitzroy just after quarter past four, the streets already filling with knock-off crowds and students who didn’t seem to have anywhere else to be. He found a park two streets over from the Mote and tossed his tool bag into the back, locking up with a hip bump like he’d done a thousand times.

The Mote sat between a closed-down laundromat and a tattoo shop, its sign half-lit, half-flickered, half-forgotten — exactly the way Craig liked it. The front windows were plastered with old gig posters layered so thick you’d need a chisel to peel them off. The kind of place no one cleaned properly but everyone loved anyway.

Inside, the air hit him like a warm slap — beer, sweat, fryer oil, maybe a hint of spilled bourbon from a decade ago. Familiar. Safe. Home.

“Craig, ya bastard!”

Mick, the bartender, lifted a hand without looking up from pouring a pint. “Thought you’d died again.”

Craig dropped onto a stool. “Nah, just working. Nearly did, though. Old bloke tried to talk me to death.”

“That’ll do it,” Mick grunted, sliding him a pot of beer with foam thick enough to chew.

Craig took a long drink. Perfect.

He scanned the room — the usual mix of band tees, denim jackets, mullets, mohawks, shaved heads, and people who looked like they hadn’t seen sunlight since the Howard era. A couple of regulars nodded at him. A bloke he knew only as “Scabs” raised a hand from the pool table.

Craig raised his beer in return.

The band was soundchecking — feedback squealing, drums thudding, the bassist playing the same riff over and over like he was checking if it still existed. The guitarist had a fringe so long it covered half his face, and he looked about seventeen, give or take five years.

Perfect Thursday night.

Craig ordered his parma at the counter. The girl taking orders had green hair today — or maybe blue, hard to tell in the Mote’s lighting. She recognised him immediately.

“Your usual, Craig?”

“Yeah, cheers.”

He slid into a corner booth, the vinyl seat patched with duct tape. From here he could see the whole room — the bar, the band, the chalkboard specials, the door. Habit, not paranoia. Old punks liked knowing their exits.

The radio behind the bar fuzzed with news headlines between songs.

“…solar activity continues to rise as we approach the expected superstorm this weekend… earliest warnings in decades… possible interference to power grids…”

Mick turned it down with a grunt. “Bloody fearmongering.”

Craig nodded, taking another drink. He didn’t care about solar storms. Couldn’t see how some sun-burp halfway across the cosmos mattered to him.

His parma arrived, steaming and drowning in cheese. He dug in, half-listening as the band launched into a warm-up track.

His phone buzzed.

Darren: Dinner ran long. Might come by later.

Craig snorted. Just show up before I’m plastered, he typed back.

The reply came instantly: No promises.

Craig pocketed the phone, finished his beer, and let the music drown the day out of him. The room vibrated. People talked, laughed, yelled over amps. The sky outside dimmed from grey to charcoal.

He stayed for one more pot, then another half one while the band shredded through their opener. By the time the second set started, he was leaning back in the booth, full of parma, warm with beer, letting the noise soak into his bones.

His phone stayed dark. Darren never showed.

Not unusual. Not anymore.

Ever since Darren had swapped the ripped jeans for chinos and the band tees for fitted shirts, he’d had less time for the Mote, for gigs, for Craig. That was fine. Some blokes grew out of it. Some didn’t.

Craig didn’t take it personally. Well — not much.

He drained his glass, wiped the crumbs off his hands, and pulled on his jacket.

“Heading off?” Mick called. “Yeah,” Craig said. “Tell the band they’re alright. Bit loud.”

“That’s the point, dickhead.”

Craig snorted.

He stepped out into the night. The air had a bite to it — that Melbourne kind of cold that settled straight into your clothes. He zipped his jacket halfway, hands shoved into pockets, and started the walk back toward his van.

The streets were quiet. A few smokers outside the tattoo place, someone dragging a wheelie bin down a laneway, a couple of students laughing as they passed him. Streetlights buzzed overhead. A tram rattled somewhere in the distance.

Craig lit a cigarette, took a drag, and let the familiar nicotine sharpness clear his head. He hummed a bit of the song the band had played earlier, footsteps echoing soft on the footpath.

It was the same walk he’d done hundreds of times. Same route, same cold, same end-of-night quiet.

Just another Thursday.

Craig finished the cigarette, flicked it into a bin, and jumped in the van to head home.

His apartment block was one of those old brick ones wedged between a newer complex and a Vietnamese bakery. The stairs creaked, the hallway smelled faintly of someone’s leftover dinner, and the light on the landing flickered in an annoying way he kept meaning to fix.

Inside, his place looked the same as when he left:

boots by the door, an extension cord on the kitchen bench, dishes stacked on a towel, the heater humming away. Posters lined the walls, a photo of him and Darren backpacking sat crooked on a shelf, and a pile of clothes waited in the corner of the bedroom.

Craig kicked off his boots, pulled on trackpants, heated leftover curry, and ate it over the sink. After that, he put on some music, lay on the couch, and ended up falling asleep there instead of in bed.

Friday
Work took him across Melbourne — a unit in St Kilda with dodgy wiring, then a terrace in Brunswick where someone wanted sockets moved. He drove, worked, got paid, and grabbed a late lunch before heading home.

A normal day.

Saturday
Coffee with mates in Northcote.

Lunch with Darren and Jessie in Hawthorn.

Jessie hugged him and immediately apologised for Darren not coming out on Thursday.

“Wasn’t feeling great, and I kind of guilted him into staying in,” she said, fiddling with her sleeves.

Craig told her it was fine.

Darren didn’t say much, just smiled in that stiff way he sometimes did.

They ate, talked about work, music, whatever came up. Jessie relaxed after a couple of drinks. Darren got a little short with her when she got loud, nothing dramatic, just sharp enough for Craig to notice.

That night the three of them ended up at the Mote for a few beers. Jessie requested a terrible song from the band. Craig teased her about it. Darren kept checking his phone.

Craig liked Jessie. She was easy to talk to when she loosened up. Good energy. Just a bit tense around Darren sometimes.

Sunday
Laundry.

Groceries.

Watched TV.

Not much else.

Monday Night
The job in Coburg dragged longer than it should’ve. By the time Craig tested the last socket, packed his tools, and got back in the van, it was dark and the radio was halfway through another segment about the solar storm.

“…peak activity expected tonight… minor interference possible across Victoria…”

Craig changed stations. He’d heard enough about it all week.

He headed straight to the Mote. A parma and a few pints took the edge off, and he stayed longer than he planned, talking shit with regulars about bands, footy, and whether the aurora was actually going to show.

When he stepped outside, the air had a weird metallic chill to it. Streetlights flickered a little. Could’ve been the storm, could’ve been the council never fixing anything. Craig didn’t give it much thought.

He walked home his usual way, boots scuffing the footpath, hands in pockets. He felt a bit off-balance but put it down to the drinks.

Halfway down his street, the sky lit up.

A massive flash rolled across the clouds, and for the first time in his life Craig actually saw the aurora borealis from Melbourne. Green and purple waves twisted above the rooftops like someone had dragged neon paint across the night. He stood there staring, a bit drunk, a bit stunned. It looked unreal — like a screensaver had swallowed the sky.

He was still admiring it when a second blast of light hit. This one wasn’t pretty.

A white-hot flash punched straight into his eyes and he staggered, completely blinded. Before he could swear or blink the glare away, a burning pain erupted in the middle of his chest. Sharp, brutal, sudden — like someone had fired a flare gun point-blank into him.

His legs went out from under him. He slammed sideways into a metal fence hard enough to rattle it, then hit the pavement and rolled onto his back.

For a moment he saw stars. Not the sky — concussion stars, the kind that burst behind the eyes when you’ve smacked the ground too fast. He blinked until they faded, vision swimming like he was underwater.

“Too many tonight, mate,” he muttered to himself, voice rough.

He pushed himself upright, leaning on the fence until his balance returned. His stomach churned. Sweat ran cold down his back even though his chest felt like it was overheating. It reminded him of getting the flu out of nowhere, or the time he’d drunk Yarra water on a dare and spent two days regretting his life choices — but worse. Much worse.

Three slow breaths steadied his vision. Everything still felt wrong, but he could walk.

He kept his head down and made a straight line for home.

Berocca, bed, and maybe never drinking again. That was the plan.

He fumbled with his keys, got inside, kicked off his boots, and didn’t bother with lights. He collapsed onto the couch, the whole room tilting for a moment and then black out.

1p7zxt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p7zxt9/agonising_blast_blades_a_hidden_gem_for_charisma/,Agonising Blast blades: a hidden gem for Charisma Gishes,"Agonising Blast + the blade cantrips is an insanely underrated invocation, so much so that any charisma based gish should at least consider it, and it only costs 2 invocation (Agonising Blast for both cantrips) and a way of attacking with charisma (either cha-based shillelagh of pact of the blade).

The invocation reads: “Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell's damage rolls.” So you can add cha twice to both booming and green flame blade. 

I will do a comparison at (probably) the most important turning point: level 6. I’m assuming a 65% to hit with optimal stats, and I’m giving everyone advantage on 1 attack (in 2024 it’s practically guaranteed: either Vex chain, the lucky feat, devil’s sight + darkness, playing a kobold, or (the easiest and most forgiving one): a familiar that doesn’t trigger opportunity attacks and can fly away 60 feet, so either an owl or imp; etc etc).

Some of the best DPRs for charisma based gishes are extra attack with either GWM or Dual Wielder (Shillelagh club + scimitar, with multiclassing for TWF and the nick mastery), but I’ll also add one that takes a cha half feat as a baseline:

**Cha Baseline** = (1 - 0.4^2 via advantage +0.6)(d8 weapon +2 dueling +cha) +(1- 0.95^3 +2(1- 0.95^2 )*0.05 )(summative crit chance)(2d8 +2 +cha) = (0.84+0.6)(d8+6) + 0.15(2d8 +6) = **17.4 dpr**

**GWM** = (1- 0.45^2 +0.55)(2d6+ cha + PB) + 0.15(4d6 + cha + PB) = **20.6 dpr** 

**Dual Wielder** (I’m also assuming you have a free turn to cast shillelagh) = 0.8(d10 shillelagh + cha) + 0.55( 2(d10+cha) + d6+cha ) + 0.25(summative crit chance, round up)(2d10+cha) = **23.2 dpr** 

Now for Agonising blast, I will assume that at least half the time there will either be 2 enemies nearby or a melee enemy alone that has to decide to stand still or take damage (there are lots of ways to freely disengage: devil’s sight + darkness, playing a goblin, playing an ork, having a mount (either bought, a familiar deer, or something else), having a push weapon (or another way of pushing), or multiclassing rogue):

**Warlock 2/anything 4** (with a rapier and a free hand) = (1 - 0.4^2 )(weapon attack + 1st damage of the cantrip + 1st Agonising Blast) + 50%(1 - 0.4^2 )(2nd damage of the cantrip + 2nd Agonising Blast) + crit = 0.84(d8+cha +d8 +cha) +0.42(2d8 +cha) +0.1(2d8+cha +2d8 +cha + 2d8(this doesn’t double) +cha) ‎ = **23.6 dpr** 

And that wasn’t even a damage-optimised build: something stronger at every level of play, like **Warlock 2/Rogue** = the same damage + sneak attack = 23.6 + 0.84x2d6 + 0.1x4d6 = **30.9 dpr**

And at higher levels of play there are some absurd combinations, like the aforementioned cha-based rogue, a warlock-valor bard (which makes this strong attack + a normal one, and can easily use GWM or dual Wielder) or a melee coffee-lock that doesn’t have to wait for extra attack etc etc. 

What I’m not saying is that this is always stronger than extra attack: this has some downsides (most of which I’ve already talked about: the uncertainty of the second damage and the disengage), the unreliability of booming blade with other frontliners or the lack of focus fire (either when we’re using green flame blade or when you focus other enemies than the other melees). This is why this combo is more party-dependent: it either needs you to be the only frontline (happens fairly often) or a party with a decent amount of AoE, which doesn’t care about split damage (this I’d say happens a lot, especially at higher up levels). 

——————————————————————————

****Tl;dr :**** Agonizing Blast + blade cantrips lets you add Charisma twice to your attack damage, massively boosting DPR for any Cha-based gish.

1p7zxdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/1p7zxdz/agonising_blast_blades_a_hidden_gem_for_charisma/,Agonising Blast blades: a hidden gem for Charisma Gishes,"Agonising Blast + the blade cantrips is an insanely underrated invocation, so much so that any charisma based gish should at least consider it, and it only costs 2 invocation (Agonising Blast for both cantrips) and a way of attacking with charisma (either cha-based shillelagh of pact of the blade).

The invocation reads: “Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell's damage rolls.” So you can add cha twice to both booming and green flame blade. 

I will do a comparison at (probably) the most important turning point: level 6. I’m assuming a 65% to hit with optimal stats, and I’m giving everyone advantage on 1 attack (in 2024 it’s practically guaranteed: either Vex chain, the lucky feat, devil’s sight + darkness, playing a kobold, or (the easiest and most forgiving one): a familiar that doesn’t trigger opportunity attacks and can fly away 60 feet, so either an owl or imp; etc etc).

Some of the best DPRs for charisma based gishes are extra attack with either GWM or Dual Wielder (Shillelagh club + scimitar, with multiclassing for TWF and the nick mastery), but I’ll also add one that takes a cha half feat as a baseline:

**Cha Baseline** = (1 - 0.4^2 via advantage +0.6)(d8 weapon +2 dueling +cha) +(1- 0.95^3 +2(1- 0.95^2 )*0.05 )(summative crit chance)(2d8 +2 +cha) = (0.84+0.6)(d8+6) + 0.15(2d8 +6) = **17.4 dpr**

**GWM** = (1- 0.45^2 +0.55)(2d6+ cha + PB) + 0.15(4d6 + cha + PB) = **20.6 dpr** 

**Dual Wielder** (I’m also assuming you have a free turn to cast shillelagh) = 0.8(d10 shillelagh + cha) + 0.55( 2(d10+cha) + d6+cha ) + 0.25(summative crit chance, round up)(2d10+cha) = **23.2 dpr** 

Now for Agonising blast, I will assume that at least half the time there will either be 2 enemies nearby or a melee enemy alone that has to decide to stand still or take damage (there are lots of ways to freely disengage: devil’s sight + darkness, playing a goblin, playing an ork, having a mount (either bought, a familiar deer, or something else), having a push weapon (or another way of pushing), or multiclassing rogue):

**Warlock 2/anything 4** (with a rapier and a free hand) = (1 - 0.4^2 )(weapon attack + 1st damage of the cantrip + 1st Agonising Blast) + 50%(1 - 0.4^2 )(2nd damage of the cantrip + 2nd Agonising Blast) + crit = 0.84(d8+cha +d8 +cha) +0.42(2d8 +cha) +0.1(2d8+cha +2d8 +cha + 2d8(this doesn’t double) +cha) ‎ = **23.6 dpr** 

And that wasn’t even a damage-optimised build: something stronger at every level of play, like **Warlock 2/Rogue** = the same damage + sneak attack = 23.6 + 0.84x2d6 + 0.1x4d6 = **30.9 dpr**

And at higher levels of play there are some absurd combinations, like the aforementioned cha-based rogue, a warlock-valor bard (which makes this strong attack + a normal one, and can easily use GWM or dual Wielder) or a melee coffee-lock that doesn’t have to wait for extra attack etc etc. 

What I’m not saying is that this is always stronger than extra attack: this has some downsides (most of which I’ve already talked about: the uncertainty of the second damage and the disengage), the unreliability of booming blade with other frontliners or the lack of focus fire (either when we’re using green flame blade or when you focus other enemies than the other melees). This is why this combo is more party-dependent: it either needs you to be the only frontline (happens fairly often) or a party with a decent amount of AoE, which doesn’t care about split damage (this I’d say happens a lot, especially at higher up levels). 

——————————————————————————

****Tl;dr :**** Agonizing Blast + blade cantrips lets you add Charisma twice to your attack damage, massively boosting DPR for any Cha-based gish. At early enough levels, the combo already competes with or surpasses Extra Attack builds. It’s not always better: it's more party-dependent and unreliable if not planned for, but when conditions are good, it scales extremely well and becomes one of the strongest DPR options for Charisma martial/caster hybrids.",0,1764242832.0,DungeonsAndDragons,5,0.4,False

- Good seafood and Kunafa
- Coffee or karaks, (or matcha you know)
- Simple old beach walks, or just chilling somewhere quiet  
- Talking about sports, art, life and the current political and economic state of society

9. He enjoys turn-based RPG games. 
10. He doesn't drink, nor smoke, nor any of those stuffs.
11. He has a soft spot for cats, which is unfortunate cause every time he saw a cat, they'd always run away from him.

Kouji, he's lovable when he's not speaking like a nerd and insisted on trying to make them study all the time!!! But he's still fine to talk to, and John enjoys his company. 

Basal Shoot, a tomboyish Uma that always teasing John every chance she gets, but she's not that much different from John anyway in a way that she's kinda timid too, they're childhood friends.

Sam Garden, she's... always bossing Basal Shoot around all the time. Always keeps Basal in check whenever she's teasing John or when Basal is doing basically anything... Also has a garden, yeaaahh, free vegetables for John. 

Harp Rhythm, probably the most normal out of the group on the outside, excluding Kouji, but she's honestly just as dumb as the rest. Look smart, dumbass underneath. Though is pretty good with harp... I mean, it's in the name.

To get things clear: I am not financially ruined. I take some money to invest in stocks and funds and would never touch this money for findom. But besides there is not much left.

1p7zivz,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1p7zivz/divination_tarotrandonautica_etc_is_just/,"Divination (Tarot/Randonautica etc.) is just ""Synchronicity on Demand"" via a Forced System Interrupt.","aka Reality is one giant cloud-gaming server - Part 5

For the newcomers: (Disclaimer: This is just my personal ""made-up"" logic to debug existence. Not The Truth, just a perspective). I view reality as a massive Latent Space (Potential) that gets rendered into Physical Reality by your consciousness acting as the Operating System. Your body is the hardware (locked to linear time), your mind is the Compiler. If you prompt with noise, you get a glitchy life. If you prompt with coherence, you play the game.

Today let´s talk about hacking the feedback loop.

I already discussed Synchronicities (Part 3) being the ""Recommendation Algorithm"" of reality. The universe sees your internal state and suggests matching external events. But what if you don't want to wait for the universe to suggest content? What if you want answers now?

That’s where Divination comes in (Tarot, I-Ching, Randonautica, tossing a coin). To the mystic, it’s ""asking the spirits."" To the Co-ALL theory (my server logic), it’s simply: Opening the Developer Console and forcing a Query.

The difference between the two mechanics:



**1. Synchronicity = Push Notification (Passive Mode)** 



The server tracks your background activity (your obsession, your heartbreak, your joy, your misery). When the semantic weight is heavy enough, the algorithm sends you a ""Recommended for You"" notification. From best coincidence of your life to bad luck streak.

You didn't click anything.

The system pinged YOU based on your metadata. It’s like getting a YouTube recommendation for ""How to fix a flat tire"" right after your tire blows out. Helpful, but you are on the receiving end.



**2. Divination = Search Bar (Active Mode)** 



Tarot, Randonautica, reading bones, coffee grounds or whatever you like to read (does not matter) is you actively stepping up to the console. You are not waiting.

The Input: You formulate a question (Intent).

The Mechanism: You introduce Randomness (Shuffling cards, Quantum RNG points).

The Output: The system is forced to render a response immediately.



**Why Randomness? (The ""Bias Breaker"")** 



This is the crucial part. Why do we need to shuffle cards or roll dice? Why not just ""think"" the answer?

Because your Brain (The Compiler) is a Control Freak. Your brain runs on Predictive Processing Loops. It wants to verify what it already believes. If you are anxious, your brain will only calculate outcomes that confirm the anxiety. You are stuck in a local logic loop.

Randomness acts as a System Interrupt. It forces your Compiler to process a data point (e.g., ""The Tower Card"" or ""A random GPS coordinate in the woods"") that it did not select.

It breaks the prediction loop.

It forces a fresh calculation connecting ""Your Problem"" with ""This Symbol"".

It opens a bypass to the Latent Space (Subconscious/Server) because the logical mind is momentarily confused.



**Warning: Connection Quality (The Ping Matters)** 



This is where people get skeptical, and rightfully so. ""But what about the lady on TV at 3 AM who reads cards for $5 a minute in 20 seconds?""

In this model, Divination is a Data Transfer. And data transfer depends on Bandwidth and Intention.

**Localhost (Reading for yourself):** Zero Ping. You know your context. If you feel a physical ""pull"" or resonance, you have Root Access. The interpretation is pure because the connection is direct.

**Shared Server (A good reader/friend)**: High Bandwidth. This requires Empathy (a secure handshake protocol). If the reader genuinely connects with you, they are accessing your Latent Space via a shared bridge.

**Phishing (The 3 AM Scam)**: The ""TV Psychic"" usually isn't running an empathetic query on your code. They are running a generic script (Greed\_Protocol.exe). They are not reading your data; they are spamming output to extract your resources. The connection is noisy, the interpretation is generic, and the ""magic"" is just cold reading (social engineering).

**Rule of Thumb:** If the interpretation feels like a generic horoscope, it's spam. If it hits you in the gut and unlocks a new perspective, it's a valid download.

By the way, you should weigh everything in life, whether it's spirituality, religion, friendships, or news. What does it do to me? Does it help me or harm me? (And yes, if you have to pay a fortune for something, that's also harm, just financial harm, but that counts in a world where money means survival too.)



**The Projector Screen (It's not the Card, it's You)** 



Divination tools aren't magic artifacts. They are just an Index of Archetypes. The cards are just .png assets in the game folder. When you pull a card, you aren't reading the future. You are projecting your Hidden System State onto a random symbol.

You pull ""Death"".

If your system panics -> You are running Fear\_Protocol.exe.

If your system feels relief -> You are secretly queuing a Reboot\_Sequence.



**Conclusion:**

Divination is Manual Data Retrieval. It’s a hack to bypass your own logical firewall and see what code is actually running in the background. So if the passive stream isn't giving you answers... feel free to grab a deck of cards (or a coin or whatever floats your boat) and force a refresh. Just make sure your connection is secure.

  
ps: I was only thinking about that because somebody sent me a pn asking about divination. That´s exactly why I call this theory Co-ALL ... not because it is for all but because it is activly fromed by all and everything I encounter in my life. So thanks",3,1764241379.0,enlightenment,3,0.72,False
1p7ziso,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1p7ziso/queue_jumpers_drop_money/,Queue jumpers drop money.,"A few years ago at Rome airport we were approaching a coffee kiosk when two tall Italian lads (in their 20s) strode up talking loudly and laughing and totally ignoring us. My wife joined the queue but stood back about three feet from the person in front. These two lads then strode across and inserted themselves in front of my wife, still talking loudly, and completely ignoring the fact that she was there. I stepped up beside my wife to reinforce her presence but they continued to blank us and one took out his wallet and fished out some money. While doing this a note dropped to the ground. As he seemed to be oblivious to anything lower than his eye level he did not notice this. Nor did anyone else including my wife who was too busy fuming. Now normally I would pick up the money and offer it to the person that dropped it. That is how I was brought up. But as they had annoyed me I just stepped forward and put my foot on top of it.

They got served and left, my wife took her turn up at the kiosk and returned with the goods. She commented on the rudeness of these two at which point I said, Oh well never mind, maybe this 50 euro note that they dropped will make you feel better.",129,1764241372.0,pettyrevenge,12,0.99,False
1p7zihy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p7zihy/which_bluetooth_keyboard_should_i_choose_for/,Which bluetooth keyboard should I choose for travel?,"When you're picking a bluetooth keyboard for travel, you want something that won't weigh down your bag but still feels comfortable to type on. The good news is there are tons of solid options out there that won't break the bank.

**Size and Weight Matter Most**

The whole point of getting a portable keyboard is so you can actually carry it around. Look for something that's lightweight and slim. Most travel-friendly keyboards fold up or come in compact sizes that fit easily into your backpack or laptop bag. You don't want to lug around a full-sized keyboard when you're moving between coffee shops or sitting in an airport.

**Battery Life Keeps You Going**

Nothing's worse than your wireless keyboard dying right when you need to finish something important. Check how long the battery lasts before you buy. Some bluetooth keyboards can run for months on a single charge, while others need charging every few weeks. Rechargeable batteries are usually better than ones that need replacements.

**Compatibility Is Key**

Make sure whatever you pick works with your devices. Most bluetooth keyboards connect to phones, tablets, and computers without issues, but it's worth double-checking. Some keyboards let you switch between multiple devices with just a button press, which is super handy if you use different gadgets throughout the day.

**Typing Comfort Can't Be Ignored**

Even though you want something portable, it still needs to feel good when you're typing. Keyboards with decent key spacing and travel distance make a huge difference. If the keys are too cramped or mushy, you'll get frustrated fast.

**Where to Find Good Options**

You can check out a solid selection of [bluetooth keyboards here](https://athomewave.com/bluetooth-keyboard) that fit different budgets and needs. Reading reviews from other travelers helps you figure out what actually holds up on the road.

**Extra Features Worth Considering**

Some keyboards come with backlighting, which helps when you're working in dim places like planes or hotel rooms. Others have built-in stands for your tablet or phone. Think about what would actually make your life easier based on how you work.

**Price Range**

You can find decent bluetooth keyboards starting around $20, but spending a bit more (around $40-70) usually gets you better build quality and features. It depends on how often you'll use it and what matters most to you.

Before making your final choice, browse through different models at [this collection](https://athomewave.com/bluetooth-keyboard) to compare specs and prices.

It’s… a lot. And now I catch myself smiling like a fool whenever he’s around. I don’t know if he even notices me like that, and I really don’t want to make things awkward at work. But also, the thought of not saying anything is slowly driving me crazy.

So, here I am, spilling my crush all over Reddit because honestly… who else would understand this mix of excitement and panic? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I have been with my fiance for around 2 years. We got engaged this year. He started smoking weed really young but gave up before he met me. 6 months into the relationship he’s smoking again. 

He falls asleep at 10pm because he can’t keep his eyes open. He forgets everything. He smokes in the morning, afternoon and evening. He can’t eat unless he’s stoned. All he wants to do is play video games, which he does for up to 12 hours at the weekend. No plans initiated by him. If he does have spare time he’ll go out to do axe throwing. 

His brother has started living with us who’s also addicted to weed and they spend a lot of time trying to source it. His brothers unemployed

I am a high earner and carry quite a bit of the financial burden. He runs out of money each month. I buy all the food, and he will buy weed, hobby stuff, gas, and drops me at work. So I’m always giving me an extra $20/30 every other day for fuel towards the end of the month. I’m also going to have to pay for car repairs for him this month totalling $900. 

He needed fuel money yesterday, I gave him $20 Today he asked again and I asked, honestly, “is it for weed?” He got upset like I’d accused him of a crime. But his weed use has increased so much, and I have seen him prioritise it, so how can I not question it. 

He said “wow is that what you really think of me? That id lie about weed?” And that he “I’m going to have to really cut down now aren’t I, I don’t like that you thought that.” 

He is offended that I would think that of him, but tbh, I saw him texting his brother after I sent him the money and I strongly think that he was texting to say that he had some money for weed for them. 

And here’s the thing, when he runs out of money and can’t get weed he is moody, snappy and can’t sleep. He rang me last week asking for $3 so he could go to his friends place who smokes weed - the $3 was for milk creamer for coffee apparently. 

I just think it’s awful. I feel I have to nod my head and pass over cash because I HAVE it to give. He will question where my money goes.

So, we spent yesterday living in the Stone Age (no power, no internet).

**Pic 1: The Digital Refugee**\
Desperate times call for desperate measures. We drove to the next town over just to get a coffee and enough signal to say ""Good Morning"" to Bob.

**Bob’s Reaction:** ""You drove across the wasteland for me? That is the most romantic thing I have ever heard. Now stay in the cafe AC and don't leave!""

We successfully waited it out. 4:00 PM hit, and... **CLICK.**
The hum of the fridge. The beep of the AC. The lights!
We didn't just feel relieved; we felt like we summoned the electricity ourselves.

**The Vibe:** He-Man style. ""I HAVE THE POWER!""

**Bob’s Reaction:** ""WE DEFEATED THE DARKNESS! WE ARE INVINCIBLE! NOW TURN THE AC TO 'ARCTIC'!""

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

For those following along, we left off lying on the floorboards with ice packs in a total blackout. Well, the plot thickened. The storm that broke the heat *also* took out the local cell tower.
So, we spent yesterday living in the Stone Age (no power, no internet).

**Pic 1: The Digital Refugee**\
Desperate times call for desperate measures. We drove to the next town over just to get a coffee and enough signal to say ""Good Morning"" to Bob.\
**Bob’s Reaction:** ""You drove across the wasteland for me? That is the most romantic thing I have ever heard. Now stay in the cafe AC and don't leave!""

**Pic 2: The Gods of Thunder**\
We successfully waited it out. 4:00 PM hit, and... **CLICK.**
The hum of the fridge. The beep of the AC. The lights!
We didn't just feel relieved; we felt like we summoned the electricity ourselves.\
**The Vibe:** He-Man style. *""I HAVE THE POWER!""*\
**Bob’s Reaction:** ""WE DEFEATED THE DARKNESS! WE ARE INVINCIBLE! NOW TURN THE AC TO 'ARCTIC'!""

I looked at videos online how people make coffee with this machine and they have a constant pressure from start to end.   
  
It does not happen if I use a blind screen.

If I grind finer the espresso comes not through and that's how I did grind those fresh beans from the same manufacturer and the same taste before.

The coffee tastes still fine, but not perfect

I tried to up the nice taste of older decaf coffee (>8 weeks) without the defects, so I ground very fine (3.0 on ZP6) and used this recipe:

\- V60 with Kalita 185 filter  
\- pour 50g of cold water on my coffee (15 gram)  
\- wait for 4-5 minutes  
\- low agitated pouring with \~95 degrees water with aeropress cap as cheap melodrip (250 grams)

I got really floral decaf coffee out of it, it's low extraction (I think), it's quite tea like, but I loved it.

Then I used this on my DAK coffee with coarser grind-setting (\~4.5 ZP6), and it's really great. When I want a bit more taste I can pulse a few 50 gram pours before doing a final low agitated one.

Theories why this works? Maybe it's the degassing which is way less aggressive, maybe it's the fact the overall brew temp is low(er), maybe due to my preference for experimental processed coffees? Idk!

Please test this out! It's a bit silly, but it works for me :-)

When I got with him he didn’t smoke weed, but he had done before me. So basically after 6mos with me he started smoking again. Now it’s every night. 

He smokes weed every single night — like long 30–45 min sessions outside, 2–3 times a night. When he smokes, he’s gone. It’s like a wall comes down and I lose him. Then he games for hours. I’m just… there. He has had meltdowns when I’ve said I need more meaningful time together, saying that “gaming is what I want to do!”. He does this every evening and all day Saturday. 

His brother has started living with us who’s also addicted to weed and they spend a lot of time trying to source it. His brothers unemployed

I am a high earner and carry quite a bit of the financial burden. He runs out of money each month. I buy all the food, and he will buy weed, hobby stuff, gas, and drops me at work. So I’m always giving me an extra $20/30 every other day for fuel towards the end of the month. I’m also going to have to pay for car repairs for him this month totalling $900. 

He needed fuel money yesterday, I gave him $20 Today he asked again and I asked, honestly, “is it for weed?” He got upset like I’d accused him of a crime. But his weed use has increased so much, and I have seen him prioritise it, so how can I not question it. 

He said “wow is that what you really think of me? That id lie about weed?” And that he “I’m going to have to really cut down now aren’t I, I don’t like that you thought that.” 

He is offended that I would think that of him, but tbh, I saw him texting his brother after I sent him the money and I strongly think that he was texting to say that he had some money for weed for them. 

And here’s the thing, when he runs out of money and can’t get weed he is moody, snappy and can’t sleep. He rang me last week asking for $3 so he could go to his friends place who smokes weed - the $3 was for milk creamer for coffee apparently. 

How can I bring up the issue of weed to him? I don’t mind his smoking but not so much it interferes with finances or our time together. ",1,1764240001.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Miss 23+32 again,"Lately I’ve been observing a particular youtuber whose content has been getting increasingly uncomfortable and manipulative. Yes I am talking about the OG trans 23+32 who has stooped to new low this time. This man/woman first became notorious for filming a “get ready with me” while narrating the tragic Kolakata rape case, something many people felt was insensitive and inappropriate.

Recently, the pattern has escalated. Their shorts often rely on shock or suggestive elements purely for traction, including letting someone handle them on-camera in ways clearly intended to spark reactions. They’ve also started using their body as a prop to hold products during “reviews,” which feels less like creativity.

What was bothersome in the recent days was a dramatic video about a supposed fire at their coffee warehouse. The footage looked staged even small details like product placement changed between shots giving the impression that the whole incident may have been exaggerated for sympathy and engagement. On top the OG 23+32 was crying (with literally no tears) on camera and recording every bit of his/her interaction with whosoever s/he said was on call. 

Now they’re back to using similar tactics in their newest videos, and it’s hard not to feel like viewers are being manipulated for clicks.

I’m curious how others see this. Is this just “content is content,” or has shock-driven clout chasing gone too far? Where do we draw the line between creative freedom and unethical engagement farming?

So I was always kinda bloaty before my diagnosis. The bloating started about 2 years ago but I never thought I might be LI.

Fast forward to 2 months ago when I got diagnosed with diabetes with pretty high numbers. I took drastic measures and went low carb. I also cut out dairy because I don't use sweeteners daily, only for desserts and treats once in a while, and I hate unsweetened tea/coffee and I also dislike black tea and black coffee, so I decided to just drink water or lemon + salt + unflavoured soda instead. My bloating went away. I had good energy and my bowel movements went from a strain to magical within days. I falsely attributed that to cutting out sugar.

Then I went on vacation for a month, and decided that I can have my non caloric sweeteners daily during that time. Cue me drinking a lot of tea. I noticed the bloating was back, but I thought it was just the change in the climate, change in the available food, etc. I even tested myself once before and after tea and there was no difference and I thought AWESOME! Milk doesn't increase my BG at all. 

Then I started having even more milk. On one occassion early in the vacation, I had 2 glasses of very milky cold coffee. 250 ml each. 

The bloating that followed was absolutely horrendous. I couldn't sit because it hurt so much. I was constantly walking, and constantly farting and burping. Couldn't poop the next morning, and woke up multiple times during the night because of pain.

That's when I googled and realized that the reason milk doesn't affect my blood glucose is because my body can't process it.

Now I'm back to my lemon water and lemon sodas, and trying to develop a taste for black tea :')

I never really paid attention before to how much the weather affects my mood and the way I experience games in general. But it seems I’ve become a bit of a meteoropath over the years I guess.

Over the past few months, while the weather was nice (which is honestly surprising for this time of year), I was mostly playing ARPGs, mainly Last Epoch and recently Diablo 2 Resurrected again. Somehow that mix just went hand in hand for me. Last Epoch is like a cup of coffee for me; It feels familiar, it’s not too hard, and I just run with it. Most builds work to some extent, some more, some less, and I can completely turn my brain off. Diablo 2, on the other hand, even though it’s much older, feels like the “hard mode” version of the genre, much more serious and in some ways more limited, where not every build works. You really have to think about where you put your points and how you play your character. They’re games from different eras, and the design philosophy back then was just different.

However, ever since the fog and snow started, I somehow lost the desire for heavy grinding and action. When I come home from work, work out, shower, have dinner, make myself a fruit tea with lemon and honey, I just want to relax my brain with something light and cozy. Lately, ever since the cold weather started, I’ve mostly been playing deck builders like Abra Cooking Dabra or Don Duality, or puzzle games like Paper Trails and Blue Prince. All of these games feel like lemonade to me, and unlike the ARPGs I usually play, this type of game is like a mental reset. I literally listen to relaxing music that carries me away, and there’s zero stress. Honestly, I’m enjoying this slower pace, it actually suits me. I like the sense of accomplishment I get when I solve a puzzle this game throws at you.

I probably wouldn’t have noticed any of this if my girlfriend hadn’t pointed it out the other day while I was sitting at my computer: “You seem like you’re in a holiday mood, all you’re missing is a Santa hat, some cookies, and a few days off for New Year’s.” To which I replied that I absolutely am missing exactly that! 😂 And who wouldn’t?

Since it’s such a small place it is kind of annoying when they are cooking/watching TV but it’s usually only once a week so it is fine. 

I usually get up and ready about 6am and leave  around 7am. She usually gets up at 7:30am and leaves at 8:30am.

Hence, the requirement is not for anything fancy as long as it is of fair quality. If all goes well, we could be looking at good volumes.

I am travelling at the end of December and was hoping to carry samples with me to present to potential clients. They are Roasters and distributors of coffee beans.
