This was many years ago, maybe 15-20 years ago or so. It was a game on a flip phone I had. Idr if you could do character customization or not. But it was a full on game. There were chibi models of character, it had multiple locations like your bedroom, coffee shop, etc. You could play mini game jobs to make money, like as a barista or so on, and I believe depending on how you did you could get better and better jobs. The main focus was the dating sim part. You could choose from multiple male/female characters and you could go to the many locations for your date and once you got there you could choose what you wanted. Like I do remember you could take them to your house and choose to sleep in the bed together, like literally sleep 💤 I do remember you could date fxf and mxm along with fxm.

1n080cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1n080cu/i_have_no_clue_what_im_doing/,I have no clue what I’m doing.,"Almost four years ago, I graduated with a degree in Journalism. Haven’t used it at all (LOL). I currently work as a barista and I’m about to work a seasonal job with a basketball team in their Communications department. Every job I’ve had out of college has been food service, coffee shop management, or my one year as a teacher. And I didn’t like any of those positions. They drained the heck out of me. 

By the time I graduated, I absolutely despised my degree. The pandemic hit during what was supposed to be the best years of my college career, and I just never bounced back. No one’s fault but my own. I completely lost motivation and lost my sense of purpose. By the time I had any clue of what I wanted to do, it was time to graduate and I couldn’t afford to switch majors or go back to school. 

Now, I’m just eager to leave the food industry for good and find something that I love to do that I will be able to stick with for the next 30 years. For those who ended up hating your degree, what did you do? How did you change your career path? And if you went from a food service job into a completely different industry, how did you do it? Any advice would be great. 

For context, I have management skills from my time as a coffee shop manager, writing stills are still intact (for the most part) from my degree and job with the basketball team, and I had admin experience from being an office assistant. I want to work either in HR or office administration just because that seems to be the easiest thing to transfer my skills to. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. ",1,1756169418.0,findapath,2,1.0,False

I'm not completely opposed to spending this much, as I want this kit to last me a while, but I want to be smart with my money. I have decent experience with coffee, but I don't need the advanced features such as precise temperature control. My main concern here is aesthetics, and I'm hoping someone here knows alternatives that match the style of these Fellow products, without the premium price tag attached.

I’d also love recommendations for art that has some character to it.

1n07wh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n07wh8/why_did_he_act_like_this/,Why did he act like this?,"I (21F) need some outside perspective on a situation with a guy (20M) that's been leaving me feeling confused.

I am conventionally attractive (have done a bit of modeling), however, men rarely approach me. If they do, they usually end up being players and ghost when it's clear I don't want to sleep with them. I've also never had a boyfriend before, and my only dating experience is one date that unfortunately didn't go any further because of my insecurities over our height difference. I'm incredibly socially awkward and possibly autistic, which is another reason for my dating struggles and social struggles in general.

However, last semester, I was approached by one of my classmates. He, like me, is socially awkward and shy. He was the first guy to approach me who seemed genuinely interested in me as a person and not my appearance. He congratulated me on getting on the honour's list (which he couldn't have known unless he actively searched for my name on the list), which really surprised me and flattered me. I also didn't think he would have wanted to hang out with me at all considering our racial differences (I'm black and he's asian). Last semester, he glanced at me constantly during class, used a meal swipe to pay for my dinner, and asked to study with me. However, during finals he went completely silent, only to send a simple ""enjoy your summer"" text. During the entire summer, we didn't talk at all. I decided to text him first this semester to ask if he wanted to get coffee, to which he immediately said yes to and even showed up ten minutes earlier than the time we agreed on. 

This time, however, it was a bit awkward. I didn't wear anything fancy, just a crop top and short shorts, though crop tops are usually a bit more revealing than the t-shirts I usually wear. When I showed up, he looked genuinely freaked out. He stuttered constantly, couldn't make eye contact, and even took a step back when I approached. The other few times we've hung out, he's always been a bit nervous. But this time it was another level. I decided to pay for our coffee in the hopes that it would help him calm down and because I wanted to repay him for the meal swipe last semester. It seemed to have worked; he relaxed and we talked for an hour after that. 

But for the past day, I've been replaying his actions in my head and wondering if he was nervous because he was uncomfortable being around me. He has plenty of friends, more than I do, so I don't see why he would bother hanging out with me when he can easily find another girl to talk to. The next day, I saw him on campus and was planning to ignore him since I was convinced he didn't want anything to do with me, until he said hi so I said hi back. It's been almost 48 hours since we got coffee, and we haven't texted each other. 

So my question is, why did he ghost during finals last semester and act so nervous this semester? Should I move on and find someone who will initiate more and show fewer mixed signals? ",1,1756169129.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

This is not really as socially acceptable in England no one does this. 

I understand the going to the same places over and over, seeing the same people and talking to them. I do this at the gym and I am acquainted/friendly with so many people at my gym, but they’re all men (I’m a woman) and I want more female friends and there are no women at my gym at the time I go. I don’t really want to be friends outside of gym with most of them because they’re either old enough to be my dad or younger than me, plus they would definitely get the wrong idea unfortunately. 

People say on these post’s ‘go to hobby clubs / social clubs!’ they just don’t exist around me, again i think thats more of an American thing and if they do exist its mainly older women which I don’t have a problem with, I love interacting with all ages but I want a small group of girl-friends who I can go out with. 

I don’t post on social media and I think that definitely holds you back from opening up old connections with old school friends.

We never had an official label. I was in his city for about three months when we immediately got very close. We were even talking about marriage. He mentioned being scared to date since he didn’t know if he could marry due to family/cultural pressure. He was traveling at one point and his family made him meet a girl there but he said it didn’t go anywhere and he would ask me to marry next. In the beginning, the excuse was the I was moving away for a few months at least and it didn’t make sense to commit without a future plan. During long distance, I started getting and acting anxious - bc I wanted a committed relationship and I was always scared of his family setting him up. We had a lot of arguments and he said he lost the spark but we agreed to work on things and fix things once I moved back to his city. A few weeks before i moved, he was traveling to that same country again with family and I didn’t think much of it. Even on his way there he was acting all lovey dovey with me. On his flight back, he was a totally different person. He said it was because he had panic attacks there and was dealing with health issues. Once I moved to his city (literally down the street from him to an apartment he toured for me), he said I got too attached and refused to meet me. This went on for seven months. He kept saying we’re just friends and I need to reset and stop being so attached and then we could start over. And also he was having panic attacks and health issues so wasn’t ready to date me or anyone and told his family he wouldn’t get married in at least three years. I was giving him space to deal with his stuff. This whole time, we were texting every and snapping and sexting and what not. We had a lot of arguments and I told him I was too attached and couldn’t move on and told him to block me and he never did. If I stopped texting him, he would come back and talk to me. It went like this for about 7 months and then he finally wanted to see me. We met for coffee. It wasn’t anything grand but he went home to see family two days later. The following week I saw a pic of him in the same country in a wedding scene and asked him if he’s getting married and he said no and we had a huge fight and that was the first time he tried to fully end things. Even then he told me not to block his number. We still texted, he said he had Covid and was mia bc of that, two days before. And then I saw a random Instagram story of him getting married.  I always asked him if he’s getting set up or married bc his family was trying to set him up and he acted like I was crazy and paranoid. And worst of all, he got married to the girl I asked him about multiple times months before and he said it was just a work project connect/cousins friend. And from that country he was visiting. I have proof to believe they got engaged several months back at least. Even tho he denies everything. He told me he hid the wedding bc he didn’t want to hurt me. I am so heartbroken and barely getting through each day. I blindly trusted him and everything was a lie. He defends himself saying he told me to move on for several months but he wasn’t acting like friends. We were sexting, he refused to block me, texted me if I stopped talking and hid being set up/engaged from me. Maybe we weren’t in a labeled relationship so he technically didn’t cheat on me - he lied betrayed deceived me but he cheated on the wife. And I tried telling her but he made up stories about how I’m a girl obsessed with him he’s been trying to get rid off. And threatened to come after me and ruin my life if I show proof to his wife or family. I just really don’t know how to navigate this. Im falling apart and struggling to get through each day.

I’m not here to play a part or put on a performance. This space is mine — and if you’re here, you’re welcome to sit for a while.

I’d rather be barefoot in the grass or curled up with coffee and a good book than anywhere loud or fake. I keep things simple because simple is what lasts.

Hot coffee to start the day, iced coffee in the afternoons, raspberry margaritas when the mood hits, and an ice-cold beer on the deck when summer evenings won’t quit. A playlist that’s all over the place — 50s doo-wop, 90s boy bands, classic rock, old country, new country. Rom-coms where the popcorn is gone before the credits roll, and suspense movies that scare the hell out of me but I still can’t not watch them.

I’m a DIYer to my core. If something needs fixing, I’ll Google and YouTube the hell out of it before I ever ask for help. Needs come first, wants come second — that’s just how I’m wired.

This stays faceless by choice. Not because I’m hiding, but because privacy matters. Trust, respect, and loyalty matter more.

And yes, it’s called a tribute. Makes me laugh every time, because tell me that doesn’t sound like *The Hunger Games.* But here, $50.50 isn’t for sport — it’s your way of saying you get it.

1/5: hate it and can’t see how anyone would wear it. usually means i had to scrub it off my skin. will not wear again.

2/5: not a fan, but i can see what someone else might see in it. maybe a note just doesn’t work on my skin. likely will not wear again.

3/5: not bad, but nothing that particularly stands out or is unique to me. i might wear this once in a while and will probably keep in a collection, but wouldn’t go out of my way and will likely not repurchase.

4/5: enjoyable! i like this and will wear it. i’ll use up my sample and maybe even get a larger size to keep around.

5/5: i love this. everything about it works and it stands out to me in quality or complexity. i look forward to wearing this and want it permanently in my collection.

foxcroft (decaying leaves, rich black soil, dry leaves, fall air, woods, chimney smoke): definitely apple, despite the notes, and what i think is a dirt/leaves combo. getting sweeter as it goes. definitely not chilly enough for me. smells like an apple sitting on the ground, in the sun surrounded by dry crispy leaves. over time, i just get a light, sweet apple, which is nice and seems truly juicy to me in a way that’s hard to describe. i do actually quite enjoy this for the nostalgia— as someone who grew up in new england and went to many apple orchards, this smells like when you go into the little shop to pay for the bags you filled at the u-pick. a snappy, sweet apple-y scent with a whiff of dirt. it’s a clean, dry dirt, though, not dark wet loam. i may keep this, actually, as it lost this sort of craft store esque, musty quality i got when i tried it upon its initial arrival. however, i was hoping for more of a cool, slightly spooky autumn forest. 3/5

cliffside bonfire (conifers, dry woods, rain, saltwater, seaweed, ambergris (vegan), charred wood, smoke): thick, sticky pine sap and smoke. salt begins to come through as it dries. there actually is something refreshingly oceanic about this that is happily not putting me in mind of a generic men’s cologne. it gets a little earthier, losing some of that stickiness. it faded, so i put on more on the back of my arm. same thing. i really like the opening, which has this warm, dark, resinous quality, and with the salt air coming in it to give it a lovely lift and lightness that feels incredibly atmospheric. however, that pine sap base fades quickly and i’m left with  something a little sharp and salty, but without anything to ground it. fades far too quickly and doesn’t keep the notes i enjoy, and without the projection i look for in a scent. after a little longer, it loses the sharpness, but is still too faint and simple for me. it’s a generic and faint non scent. this would be a 4/5 or 4.5/5 if not for the extremely fast disappearance of everything else which makes this more of a 2/5.

russian caravan (amber, smoked black tea, leather, pine resin, earth, smoke, black currant, black pepper): leather and smoke. very little tea, or maybe that’s bolstering the leather and smoke. the leather is a realistic, tangy leather scent, not as much the smooth smell of old, polished leather but something newer, perhaps still with the tangy scent of the treatment and first polish on it. it’s almost fruity or fermented, like smashed apples left over from cider making left to sit. this fades and sweetens as it dries. it becomes ever so slightly woody. the smoke doesn’t last. not offensive, but too faint for me to wear. after awhile (not even twenty minutes), this is like the memory of leather. not bad, just not for me. i was hoping for tea. 2/5

sawmill (fresh cut wood, wood resin, balsam, cured woods, pine, black coffee, motor oil, amber, saw dust): the sweet, burnt-sugar smell of freshly cut wood mixing with piles of wood shavings. something barely acrid or mechanical in the background, like the machine itself has been sitting for awhile to grow faint and dusty. whiffs of cedar and pine, maybe, a few different woods mingling. the sweetness fades a little after a few minutes. this now smells woodsy without evoking the true sawmill scent that it opened with. solstice scents does have this very distinct, old-wood scent i noticed in several perfumes that is very familiar to me as someone who’s been to a lot of old barns and farm museums and historical houses. it’s this sweet, dusty, aged wood note with hints of old leather and possibly even mothballs. i will say that it’s very evocative for me and does nail some realistic notes, but sometimes overpowers the other notes in the perfume it is found in. it smells like the farm museum at my childhood town fair that i sometimes volunteered at. this also veers close to that tangy leather scent in russian caravan. i feel like i can catch the faintest whiff of coffee here, but that could be my mind tricking itself as i’m checking the notes after sampling. 3.5/5

riverside hayride (moist dirt, white carnations, fallen leaves, bare branches, hay & a hint of pressed apples): photorealistic wet musty hay and grass. this is actually horribly accurate in a lot of ways if you’ve ever smelt a hay bale that’s been sitting in a ditch on the side of a field through a few months and some heavy rain, but not something i wish to smell like at all. it fades to something that smalls how the grass-flavored jelly bean in those wacky jelly bean boxes tastes. i give it an extra half star for realism. 1.5/5

gunnerson’s pumpkin patch (leaves, vines, autumn air, pumpkin flesh, lavender, moss, balsam, tonka, hay, caramel, dirt, patchouli, mushroom): this is sickly sweet and plasticky craft store. i despise it and had to wash it off after a desperate and generous hour of waiting for it to improve. 1/5 riverside hayride: photorealistic wet musty hay and grass. this is actually horribly accurate in a lot of ways, but not something i wish to smell like at all. it fades to something that smalls how the grass-flavored jelly bean tastes. i give it a star for realism. 1.5/5

manor (woody-vanilla musk, vanilla, agarwood (oud), sandalwood): sweet, aromatic, and woody. this is pleasant. i can’t quite pick out the distinct notes but it’s very warm and does give a very atmospheric feeling, as if you’ve just gone into a seldom disturbed room of an old house that is well kept up. this is sweet and warm but manages to not veer too feminine on me. as it dries down, i do start to get a whisper of grandmother’s bathroom. 3/5

manor fire (manor base, smoke, charred wood, melted beeswax, wood resin, dry wood, burning leaves, worn leather): this is sharper and a little smoky. there’s a quality here similar to sawmill, almost the same freshly sawn and slightly sticky note. it actually feels a bit less complex to me. i don’t think it has the atmosphere of manor, which is a shame as i was expecting to like this one more. that syrupy note is a little too strong, and i wish it had more smokiness. 2/5

attic (vanilla, red cedar heartwood eo, cypress wood eo, sandalwood eo, dried rose petals): sweet and woody, nice and warm. this feels realistic and also well-blended, not overly sweet but it’s there. this is pleasant and not overly complicated. i enjoy this a little more than manor— it lacks the almost syrupy sweetness that manor had for me. this is just. old, aromatic wood. not too much else going on but there doesn’t need to be. as time went on, i did start to catch more of the sweet, sawed-wood scent that is also present (to my nose) in manor and sawmill. however, i think sawmill does it better by committing to the note and i think that attic loses a little more depth as time goes on. 3/5

farmhouse in summer (fresh cut grass, creamy gardenia, sun-dried linens, country air, sunshine, sunflowers, approaching summer storm): i’m not quite good enough with flowers to distinguish what this one smells like, but i have smelled quite a lot of them and this is certainly an actual flower, including the green smell of the cut stems still damp from being in water. i appreciate the realism here, but i don’t get much else at all. it becomes less fresh smelling after a few minutes. 2/5

if you made it down here, thanks for reading! let me know if you had similar experiences with these— i’d love to find people with noses that align :)",7,1756168412.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False
1n07msv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1n07msv/idk_what_else_to_do/,Idk what else to do,"For context- a year and some odd months ago i left my husband. Personally i don’t like to call him abusive but the relationship was very toxic and in the end we absolutely destroyed each other. I spent almost a year single. Then i ment someone who changed everything and we have been dating for a little over 3 months now. 

My partner comes from a physically abusive relationship. They cut things off earlier this year.

We both have an array of mental illnesses & trauma blocks

Things have been going so good but there’s something that has been bugging me.

About a month into out relationship my boyfriend met a girl lets call her gia and we will refer to my boyfriend as Chuck from here on out.

Gia and chuck have gotten really close really fast. Ive had a weird feeling about it, and i know i have good intuition, but i also know im severely traumatized and unmedicated, undiagnosed and im basically just raw dogging life (i garden so not completely rawdawg) 

So ive been trying my best to keep my head on. I explained to chuck that i have alot of intrusive paranoid thoughts specifically around relationships and my partner. I explained i would need his help to keep me grounded. When he met this girl and asked me if they could hang out alone, i asked how he would feel if it was reversed and if he would feel secure in the situation. He wouldn’t, and it caused a fight cause i felt it wasn’t fair to be held to different standards. I also have guy friends but choose not to hang out with them alone cause it just feels wrong too me. Maybe i am overbearing, but i laued this all out and he agrees.

She started coming into his job, like alot and sitting right at the coffee counter, that’s supposed to be for employees with the possibility of a partner if they are visiting an employee. 

Something about how close they got, and so fast, rubs me the wrong way.

Im trying to stay aware that i have issues that disorient my reality 
But things keep happening.

Sense shes was going in so seemingly often, i asked chuck to simply shoot me text if she comes in. I didn’t think it was a big thing but also told him if it was too big of a request to please tell me cause i would have been willing to hear him out if i was being irrational and that i was simply asking to check. But he said it was fine and he didn’t mind doing that for me if it helped me feel okay. 

For reference i do try my best to keep myself grounded myself. I do all the things daily and as needed. But it cant be just me making efforts to keep myself grounded if im in a relationship. For me, i rely alot on my partner to reassure me thats things are okay. Now ik thats not his responsibility and he is by no way obligated to deal with my needs but hes made it very clear that he wants to and he wants to work with me.

Gia ended up calling him when her boyfriend broke up with her. And that just makes me sick, ive had many breakups and i never once called my guy bestfriend. Which we are very close, but i have alot of respect for his wife and would never disrespect her like that. My friendship with, lets call him Fred, has always been very respectful of the fact that we could intimidate people by how close we are. 
Maybe im just crazy? I might just need someone to tell me im being insane and thats okay too.

Im just trying to unload everything so hopefully someone can give me a clear perspective 

Yesterday i was snap-chatting Gia and i noticed she was at chucks job. Chuck had not said anything to me about it so i texted him saying how i appreciate how despite it being a nuisance that he tells me when gia was around. That it helps me alot and it doesn’t go unnoticed. 
I was hoping he’d forgotten to tell me and would own it and tell me and apologize.
Instead he went “oh yea ofc… speaking of Gia shes gonna be here in a little while to study”
Shocked i checked gias snap and she fs was already at his job.
So i went “okay lmk when shes there”
And a few moments later he just goes “okay shes waking in now”
He deadass lied and i caught him but i feel like if i call him out ill be made to feel crazy.
Now apparently there hanging out just them wensday? Or at least that what the plan seems to be.
Idk im trying to not lose my shit and ruin a good thing but im also trying not to get blindsided. Am i irrational? Too much? Should i run?

Also side note and slightly of topic but i requested chucks birthday(November) off abt a month or so ago. My birthday is in September and i found out yesterday he never put in to get if off and will be working for my entire birthday weekend. Which money is good! He works so hard I just- he also knows how big my birthday is for me even if its silly he knows. 

I just feel lied to and misled but im hoping im just triggerd and my ptsd from my life and previous relationship are simply causing me too tweak. ",1,1756168397.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

1n07ku8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1n07ku8/help_finding_some_info/,Help finding some info?,"I'm looking for help trying to find a double-great grandmother's early records. Her name is Mary Elizabeth Swiney, known as Betty.

What I know for certain:

1. Born in 1885 or 1886 in Alabama.
2. Lived in Walton County, Florida in 1910 with her brother William Henry and her sister-in-law Roxie, listed as Bettie Swenney.
3. Married Robert Leondus Williams in 1912 and had 8 daughters and 2 sons (one son died as a baby, one as a young man).
4. Is listed on her brother's WWI draft card as Elizabeth Williams.
5. William Henry and Roxie got married in Walton County, Florida, in 1903 and had one daughter, Trudelle, in 1915.
6. William Henry was born in 1876 according to his grave. He probably went mainly by Henry, as that's what's on his headstone.

Less certain:

1. Betty was born in Covington County, Alabama, allegedly Red Level.
2. William Henry was born in Coffee County, Alabama; no idea what town.
3. Ancestry offered a Lidia Sweeney as a potential mother to William because of the 1880 census: [1880 Census](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYYJ-9L7J?view=index&personArk=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AM4J3-22R&action=view&cc=1417683&lang=en&groupId=). I can't confirm this is my particular William Henry, nor can I find any link to Betty (curse that burned 1890s census!) I can trace Lidia's family back to the 1860 and 1850 censuses, and I can find her parents in land and probate records in the 1850s. If this is them, they seem to have moved around the area just north of the Conecuh National Forest for a solid two or three decades.
4. They probably moved to the Walton County, Florida area around the turn of the 20th century; Roxie is in the 1900 census living in Walton County with her parents and siblings.

Granny Betty has been a big fat question mark and the source of much speculation since I learned about her, so if anyone can find any information, I'd be so grateful! Thanks in advance!",1,1756168249.0,Genealogy,0,1.0,False

“Was it too late?”

**The internet rewards action — not perfection.**

So go build something.  
Even if it’s small.  
Even if it’s messy.

1n07isq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloHome/comments/1n07isq/5_tips_for_taking_care_of_you_too/,5 Tips for Taking Care of You Too,"Hey Caregivers,

I see you and your hard days. I hear the pain and frustration when I see posts venting about the toll caregiving takes on you. I just want to remind you that you are a priority as well, because without you care doesn't happen. 

The truth is, it’s not just about what you do, but how you feel while you’re doing it. And sometimes, you need a little kindness yourself to keep going. Think of it less like a job and more like a journey—and on this journey, your well-being is just as important as the person you're caring for. Being gentle with yourself isn't a luxury; it’s the quiet strength that allows you to be there for someone else, day after day.

I'd like to talk about five small ways you can be a little kinder to the most important person in this equation: you.

1. Give Your Feelings a Hug:

It’s so easy to feel guilty about feeling anything other than grateful. But let's be honest, there are days when you're just plain exhausted, frustrated, or even angry and resentful. That's not a sign of failure; it’s a sign that you’re human. Instead of pushing those feelings away, try this: just acknowledge them. Say something to yourself like, ""It's okay that I'm feeling this way right now. This is hard, and I'm doing my best."" Just that simple moment of acceptance can take so much weight off your shoulders and give you the room to move around those feelings.

2. Guard Your Peace with a Gentle ""No"":

You might feel like you have to say yes to every request, every phone call, every extra task. But your time and energy are precious, and they’re not limitless. It's okay to set boundaries. This doesn’t mean you’re a bad caregiver; it means you’re a wise one. When you feel that pull to say yes when you really need a break, you can gently say, ""I'd love to, but I can't this time."" Saying ""no"" to something that drains you is a quiet way of saying ""yes"" to the things that nourish you, like your own rest.

3. Schedule Yourself into Your Day:

Your calendar is probably a masterpiece of appointments and to-do lists for everyone else. But where are you on that list? Even if it's just for 15 minutes, schedule a little ""me-time"" every single day. Maybe it's sitting on the porch with a cup of coffee, listening to your favorite song, or just doing a five-minute breathing exercise. These small moments aren’t just breaks; they're like little deposits in your emotional bank account. They help you feel whole again so you can show up with a full heart.

4. Let Go of the ""Perfect"" Story:

We all have this idea of the perfect caregiver in our minds, and we can be so hard on ourselves when we fall short. But perfection is an illusion, and chasing it will only make you tired. Some days, if the person you care for is safe and loved, that is more than enough. If you forget something, if a meal isn’t perfect, if you feel like you could have done better—just breathe. You’re doing a good job. Kindness starts with giving yourself grace to make mistakes. 

5. Open Your Heart to Help:

You don’t have to carry this all alone. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness or not caring; it’s a beautiful act of self-care. It's an admission that you’re not a superhero, and that’s perfectly okay. I know that for some of you, a supportive family just isn't part of your reality, and it's incredibly hard. In that case, your support system might look different, and that's okay. It might be a friend, a church group, an online community of other caregivers who ""get it,"" or a professional service from an organization. Accepting help is a way of letting others into your journey and a gentle reminder that you are loved and supported, no matter where that help comes from.

By being gentle and kind to yourself, you're not just surviving—you're nurturing the spirit that allows you to give so much to others.

1n07iqe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n07iqe,"Advice on colors, sofa material & finishing touches (plus walk-in closet ideas).","Hi everyone

We’re moving into a new top-floor apartment (105 m², 4.5 rooms) with an open-plan kitchen/living area and a loggia. We already have a general layout idea (attached images show the furniture positions, not final colors), but we’d love your input on **colors, materials, and finishing details** to make the space feel cohesive and luxurious.

**Our style:**

* A design quiz said our taste is a mix of **Glam × Modern × Tropical** (probably thanks to all the plants).
* We’d describe it as Tropical × Contemporary Minimal, but with a **luxurious touch**.
* Plants are important to us – possibly even a vertical plant wall.

**What we have / plan so far:**

* **Dining:** round marble table with anthracite chairs.
* **Living:** sofa (still open: leather vs fabric, L-shape or straight). Coffee table (we own a black square metal one, but might replace it). TV or projector undecided.
* **Bedroom:** king-size bed (2×2 m). Maybe just a sideboard instead of wardrobes.
* **Other:** two black sideboards with gold handles, mirrors (leaning or mounted), many plants, rugs (not sure yet), possible plant wall (as divider or wall feature).
* **Loggia:** my wife would love a hanging chair here – I’m neutral.

**Walk-in closet (smallest room):**

* My wife would like to turn the smallest room into a **walk-in closet**. We both currently fit into two 2×2 m wardrobes, but she likes the idea of a dedicated space.
* We’re thinking of combining open shelving with closed storage.
* Maybe add a puff/ottoman or bench – would a rug underneath look good here?
* Mirror placement (leaning vs mounted) still open.
* Lighting ideas welcome: ceiling, wall sconces, or LED strips for a chic effect.

**Biggest decoration questions:**

* **Sofa:** what color/material works best with light flooring and marble accents?
* **Color palette:** how to tie sofa, flooring, lighting, and greenery together?
* **Lighting:** suggestions for living area and closet (pendant, floor, accent)?
* **Plant wall:** anyone with experience using one indoors, as a room divider or feature wall?
* **Closet:** tips for making a small walk-in feel stylish without wasting space.

We’d love to see **color palettes, moodboards, lamp recommendations, or examples** from similar apartments. Thanks so much in advance!",1,1756168088.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1n07io9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1n07io9/cool_cops_ignorant_people/,"Cool cops, ignorant people...","After I posted last night, went out for a smoke before I grabbed my gear and left. It starts pouring rain. 'Well, I'm under shelter and I can go sit inside until it quits. I should check the weather... Not bad. Should be over soon.'

It ended. I grabbed some munchies for later and my gear and headed for my usual spot. Managed to not get my flip-flopped feet too wet on the way. 

Tent up in the exact spot I spent the previous night in. Gear in. Me in. Bed made. 'Aahhh. Nice!'

Woke up just as it started to rain. Executed tarp on tent maneuver. Got a little wet. No big deal. Back to sleep.

Up with the sun today. Teeth brushed. ""Beard removed with a razor."" ( Since this sub doesn't allow the word sh*ved. Wtf?) Gear packed. Out of tent. Tent on pack. Off to sheetz.

Coffee. Outside to smoke. Back in. Breakfast bagel. (""And we had another Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat..."") Phones charged and in pack. Out to the turnpike entrance for day three.

Five minutes in, two state patrol cars pull up in front of me. Very cordial. Ran my ID. Explained that where I was was part of the turnpike entrance. No problem. I can hitchhike from a hundred feet up from where I'm at. Basically the other side of the intersection but on the side I need to be on. They wished me well and headed off.

A little while later a guy and his wife come driving down the side of the road in what is definitely not a lane of travel. They start motioning frantically for me to move my stuff and me out if their way.

I'm not having it. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. They are not. I shake my head no, point to the ground and start yelling, ""No! This isn't a lane! I'm not moving! Get back in the road where you're supposed to be!""

By now they've stopped about six feet in front of me. Dude in the passenger seat starts opening his door. I take a step toward him, hand going for my knife. 'Don't  come out of that vehicle. This won't end the way you think it will.'

I think his wife said something to him because he closed the door. They pulled back into the lane and went on their way.

Around 4:00 another state trooper pulls over. Asks me where I'm going. We talk for a bit. He offers to run me up to Pittsburgh and buy me a bus ticket to Richmond, VA. But, he's on duty so it's contingent on his boss letting him do so. He hands me $60 he has in his wallet, quotes the bible verse about whatever you do to the least of them... and says, ""Let me go do what I gotta do. Are you gonna be here?"" ""Yeah, unless I find a ride."" ""Ok."" Off he goes.

A couple hours later another state patrol stops. ""Are you the guy trying to get to Virginia?"" ""Yeah."" ""Do you need anything?"" ""No. I'm good."" ""Ok. Neither me or anyone I work with is gonna write you a ticket, but it's illegal to stand on the side of the roadway."" ""I have a constitutional right protected by the ninth and tenth amendment to do this."" ""I'm not trying to mess with your constitutional right. You can be in the grass, just not on the roadway. The burrough might decide to be dicks and ticket you. Just letting you know."" ""Ok."" He bails.

I know better. I can stand on the side of the road as long as I don't cross the white line, do anything aggressive, or force a vehicle to change it's direction of travel. I studied the constitution and many court cases for several years.

But. I'm not getting in an argument with a cop who is just trying to help. They've all been cool so far.

That said, I don't want to be here to begin with. If push comes to shove I'll happily let them take me to jail, house me, feed me, take care of any medical issues, and cost them money while I fight it. I have nothing to lose, and all the time in the world.

Now, about Somerset, PA...
I've spent a little over thirty years hitchhiking around this country. I've been in all of the lower forty-eight states. Many times.

This is undoubtedly the shittiest group of backwards, inbred, ignorant people I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. Luckily for them, except for dude this morning, they're not outwardly hostile. But damn! Not a single person has stopped in three days. That's a new one to me.

And before you start with the, ""Nobody is obligated to give you a ride"" bullshit... Yeah. No shit. But I've been around and seen some things. I have decades of experience to back my opinion of these low IQ douchebags.

Anyway...
Eventually I got tired, cold, and hungry. I decided that cop will see me tomorrow. Off to sheetz 'cause I needed smokes. Flatbread pizza and an orange juice later... Phone is charged. It's getting dark. Hopefully I can use my same spot for another night.

I don't think these people realize how stubborn I can be. Especially since there's no other way out of town except a many mile walk out into the middle of nowhere. I'm not doing that. I'll die on that road first. Fuck 'em. As much as I try to make the best of life, I'm tired of being here. I'm not suicidal, so don't start with the reddit help bullshit. Your thoughts and prayers are more helpful than that. /s

It's gonna be in the forties tonight. I was told earlier that I'm in the highest point in Pennsylvania. That explains why the temperature swings the way it does. I'll be just fine. As long as no one wakes me up tonight. They may just hear my entire opinion on this place and the people in it. I can't reall do much if they do, but they will sure hear about it.

So, you wanna leave it all behind and hitchhike huh? 😆😆😆

This is to share (group orders) and on top of that, my husband and I drink a latte a day, him sometimes more. I’ve been into matcha for years but never been this stressed. The reason we got more than usual for ourselves is because my husband recently have started to really enjoy the taste so I got extra for our household. 

We’re lucky that between the two of us, we were able to catch 4 different Ippodo restocks. I’ve heard and read such great things about Hatoya so we caught the sale and took a chance on it with some friends to get some supply before the tariffs. Haven’t tried Hatoya yet but can report back if anyone is interested. 

Matcha, for years was just a nice little hobby for me. I’m happy when I have it, but I was also happy drinking coffee. Whenever I had time, I allowed myself to set up my matcha station and breathe a little before the work day. By no means am I a connoisseur but have just enjoyed quality matcha for a while now. When I was pregnant last year, I couldn’t stand the taste of coffee, but I gravitated towards matcha and was craving it ALL the time. Now that my baby is born, my matcha cravings are still strong. I’m just so upset that I’m now craving this HOT COMMODITY at a time like this. Something so enjoyable for me has now become a chore and filled with stress trying to catch the restocks and worrying about future supply. 

I decided that once I am done with this batch (saving it in the fridge to indulge over the next 6-12 months), I will drink whatever nice tasting matcha that is available. I won’t be stressed or worry about the next restock anymore. 

Sorry for my word vomit. I really enjoy and learn so much from this sub. If you’re in Manhattan, I’ll be happy to make you a cup of tea lol. ",5,1756168044.0,MatchaEverything,4,0.86,False

1n07guc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1n07guc/5_tips_for_taking_care_of_you_too/,5 Tips for Taking Care of You Too,"Hey Caregivers,

I see you and your hard days. I hear the pain and frustration when I see posts venting about the toll caregiving takes on you. I just want to remind you that you are a priority as well, because without you care doesn't happen. 

The truth is, it’s not just about what you do, but how you feel while you’re doing it. And sometimes, you need a little kindness yourself to keep going. Think of it less like a job and more like a journey—and on this journey, your well-being is just as important as the person you're caring for. Being gentle with yourself isn't a luxury; it’s the quiet strength that allows you to be there for someone else, day after day.

I'd like to talk about five small ways you can be a little kinder to the most important person in this equation: you.

1. Give Your Feelings a Hug:

It’s so easy to feel guilty about feeling anything other than grateful. But let's be honest, there are days when you're just plain exhausted, frustrated, or even angry and resentful. That's not a sign of failure; it’s a sign that you’re human. Instead of pushing those feelings away, try this: just acknowledge them. Say something to yourself like, ""It's okay that I'm feeling this way right now. This is hard, and I'm doing my best."" Just that simple moment of acceptance can take so much weight off your shoulders and give you the room to move around those feelings.

2. Guard Your Peace with a Gentle ""No"":

You might feel like you have to say yes to every request, every phone call, every extra task. But your time and energy are precious, and they’re not limitless. It's okay to set boundaries. This doesn’t mean you’re a bad caregiver; it means you’re a wise one. When you feel that pull to say yes when you really need a break, you can gently say, ""I'd love to, but I can't this time."" Saying ""no"" to something that drains you is a quiet way of saying ""yes"" to the things that nourish you, like your own rest.

3. Schedule Yourself into Your Day:

Your calendar is probably a masterpiece of appointments and to-do lists for everyone else. But where are you on that list? Even if it's just for 15 minutes, schedule a little ""me-time"" every single day. Maybe it's sitting on the porch with a cup of coffee, listening to your favorite song, or just doing a five-minute breathing exercise. These small moments aren’t just breaks; they're like little deposits in your emotional bank account. They help you feel whole again so you can show up with a full heart.

4. Let Go of the ""Perfect"" Story:

We all have this idea of the perfect caregiver in our minds, and we can be so hard on ourselves when we fall short. But perfection is an illusion, and chasing it will only make you tired. Some days, if the person you care for is safe and loved, that is more than enough. If you forget something, if a meal isn’t perfect, if you feel like you could have done better—just breathe. You’re doing a good job. Kindness starts with giving yourself grace to make mistakes. 

5. Open Your Heart to Help:

You don’t have to carry this all alone. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness or not caring; it’s a beautiful act of self-care. It's an admission that you’re not a superhero, and that’s perfectly okay. I know that for some of you, a supportive family just isn't part of your reality, and it's incredibly hard. In that case, your support system might look different, and that's okay. It might be a friend, a church group, an online community of other caregivers who ""get it,"" or a professional service from an organization. Accepting help is a way of letting others into your journey and a gentle reminder that you are loved and supported, no matter where that help comes from.

By being gentle and kind to yourself, you're not just surviving—you're nurturing the spirit that allows you to give so much to others.

Remember, you deserve the same love and care you give away so freely. You can't pour from an empty cup!

1n07f8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n07f8h/i_broke_my_promise/,I broke my promise,"All parts around 2700 words. More of a first draft that I would love to build upon, thanks for reading :)



I told myself I would never turn away a client, but last week, I was forced to break that promise. I’ve dealt with many people over the years, many in their darkest hours. I’ve seen the people who have an infection from the underbelly of our flawed society; these people slip through the cracks and fall all the way down to hell with no hope of climbing back. I sought to help those unfortunate people, I was a bright-eyed young advocate for everyone and their right to gain help and treatment. For a long time I wanted to be a therapist or something in that vein, but the fact of the matter was I was too broke to afford college, and not smart enough for scholarships or working and schooling simultaneously. Despite my collegiate ineptitude, I still wanted to do what I could to help. So, while I worked at Denny’s I started a “lifecoaching” business out of my apartment. I know it sounds like I’m just conning clients out of a few bucks and giving general advice, but my clients knew I cared for them. I even implemented a 100% satisfaction guarantee, after three sessions you could decide to continue sessions with me or pay nothing for the previous three and leave. Sure a few people jumped at the idea of something free but a lot more people showed gratitude because I sacrificed money and time for their betterment. I have a very personal relationship with most of the people I see. They send me text messages and call me up, I’m basically like a friend that they know will always be there for them. From very early on I decided no client would be told they weren’t welcome back, a lot of people are on their last legs and I’m their last hope before they make a terrible life-altering decision. I see a lot of people recovering from addiction, suffering with suicidal thoughts, with untreatable and rare or severe medical conditions, and many others with detrimental circumstances. If I don’t attend to their needs, who knows what they might turn to or what they might do. A lot of these people aren’t strong enough to accept therapy or help so they come to me as a “coach” or something they are more okay with opening up to. I am the only path for many to get back on track and begin to seek professional help and appreciate their life. I never once thought about telling someone they had to find another life-coach, even if they threatened or attacked me, I never told a client to leave. Well, at least not until a couple of days ago. It’s against my entire being to make someone feel unwanted, but something about this guy just made me feel so stiff, uneasy. During our first encounter I felt the urge to throw him out of my house and onto the street. That night I remember beating myself up for thinking so brashly at a person in need.

It was Monday- no, Tuesday, and I had just finished my cup of coffee, I think I had a little too much because I was a bit jittery. My walk-in hours were just about finishing when a short figure appeared in the doorway. Without looking up from my paper I waved him in. When I looked up from my paper and to the two-seat red plush couch I saw nothing. I saw that he had not moved from the doorway, and looking at him made my hands jolt. A naked body wavered, swaying slowly forwards and back, with a large beer belly, an extremely slouched back, and disproportionately stubby arms and legs, anatomically normal but small in size. He reminded me of a baby first standing up. His head was bobbing as he swayed, delayed and more exaggerated than the rest of him. Observing his face revealed an oversized smile with gnarled yellow teeth which imitated fangs, they were long, pointy, and curved to the back of his throat. A shiny coat of thick sweat covered his bare skin, making the short hair on his head flat and the floor underneath him damp. He stood there, grinning. I looked at him stunned, before regaining my composure and trying to show no outward signs of judgement; he was a person and deserved to be treated as such. I shook it off and peered into his glassy eyes that seemed to stare unblinking at me, his pupils dilated and cloudy. I told him to sit down and waved him towards the couch while I got up and fetched a robe to cover his body. As soon as I entered the kitchen my cheery smile faded and I rushed to the bathroom to collect myself. When I was calm again I unlocked the door and saw him, standing in the doorframe of the kitchen and living room, smiling with that same gaping mouth and swaying his body gently as before. “We can do this in the living room, it’s where most of our sessions will happen.” I forced a smile, “Here, I got this robe to cover you up a little bit!”. He turned and I put the robe over his shoulders, then struggled to tie the knot below his waist as his stomach was too large for the robe or my arms to reach in front of, his arms didn’t even reach his belly button so tying the robe at the top of the legs worked okay. When I actually began to tie, his waist caved to the pressure, the skin almost deflating under the knot. I tied it loose and scanned for signs of pain, he didn’t react other than let out a heavy sigh so I figured I was good to move on. My hand had grazed some of his belly sweat as I retracted my hands from the knot, it was sticky, and viscous. The sweat was more like a slime and it made my hand tingle. The man waddled towards the couch and I reluctantly returned to my office chair. I took a breath watching as he slowly sunk into the chair, the robe already soaked by his perspiration. I smiled again, “how can I help”, there was a silence of what felt like 20 minutes but most likely 20 seconds, before he began to nod slightly quicker. “Ok, and can I call you by anything?” I spoke slowly, and made my inflection clear and exaggerated. He responded. He muttered a throaty “a- a- an”- “Andy?” I tried to guess. He nodded more prominently before returning to his light sway. “Alrighty Andy!” I chuckled to no reaction from the doughy man, “Would you like to begin?” Following his methodical nod I started. I did all my regular things, trying to get to the root of his issues but all Andy would do was nod. At one point told him he was free to leave anytime and he just nodded in response. I waited a minute for him to leave but he did nothing, his sweat pooling on the couch and floor as he stared back at me. I started getting the creeps, the air in the room becoming musty and fogged, so I told him I had a prior appointment before giving him information about how to get his second visit. I had a feeling I would see him again, but I doubted he would be calling ahead. As I stood up, so did he. I walked towards the door and he followed me then went outside so I could close the door. I asked him if he had a way home and again, he nodded, walking through the grass, the patches where he stepped gleaning in the moonlight. I was a bit shaken, I stayed, frozen behind the door for a moment before grabbing a mop to clean up all the sweat that had gathered on the floor, everywhere he was he left a trail of slime. I quickly mopped up but didn’t clean the gunk from the mop bucket, I was very sleepy after all. I was shaken but so tired that I just crawled in my bed and closed my eyes, didn’t even brush my teeth.

I woke up around 3 or 4 AM. A pain in my hand was the culprit, pale and mushy, the skin looked withered and weak. I got up with a grunt and went to the sink. I washed it and the water began to flow over the epidermic layer. The white, glossy section was the source of pain; it began to conglomerate, making one small mass that began to descend from the top of my hand, the mass slithering down to the tip of my finger before the mush of skin drooped. It fell and was quickly sucked down the drain with a slurp like that of jello from a cup. The pain was mostly gone, just felt like a cut at this point. I wrapped up my hand, which was now coated in some blood from my wound, and went to bed, deciding to go to the doctor tomorrow. The alarm clock was a loud screeching beep that made my head pound. I was not in great shape, I clamored around before grabbing my keys and driving to the doctor. The doctor really wrote me off, barely looked at my hand and said I had a high fever and that I’d probably been hallucinating and just cut myself. I didn’t dare bring up Andy if she thought I was already hallucinating before. My mind wasn’t foggy and I had no other symptoms, so I tried to ask her if it could be anything else but she was already closing the door to the room. I talked to the people up front but they just told me that they don’t know and the doctor is too busy to see me again. I drove home, there’s no way all of yesterday and last night was in my head, stuff like that isn’t as consistent or as eerie as it was. But luckily, after just a few of my favorite songs I was home. I turned the corner of the apartment complex and parked in the garage connected to my apartment. I walked into my apartment and saw someone at the door. I yelled to them that I needed a sick day, but they remained. I stomped to the window beside the door and fell to the floor. Andy was back. But he was different. A lot taller, his hair curly and down to his shoulders, and a face that seemed sharper despite the overall puffiness the face had gained. I knew it was him, he had the same, angular grin, the sweaty body that soaked through an oversized t-shirt, stubby limbs, and a big, extruded stomach. Andy only stared at the door, not at me who began to ask him politely to leave. I had never told someone to leave but I had it up to here. I started shouting that I couldn’t get him sick. I called the police, although I’m generally against them. What else could I do, I was stuck, with a fever and a man I’m scared of. I looked out at Andy. He was inhaling and exhaling forcefully, almost as if he had just finished a marathon. I still feel bad about calling the police, but then again I had to keep my safety in mind. Only one officer arrived, not the best but it was better than nothing. The officer joked “Hoooly shit, the fuck we got ‘ere? Got me on creature control, which circus is you from?” Typical, cops always have a way of making someone with a problem feel even worse. If they weren’t such bullies I could call them no problem, but most of my clients wouldn't be able to take it, it’d be the last straw for them. Regardless he was here, Andy turned, waddling towards the cop. The officer told him to stop, and he did. The officer grabbed his cuffs and started to walk behind Andy, the cop grabbed his shoulder before stepping back in disgust. “Ew, what the fuck is that?? Disgusting.” The officer then grabbed Andy’s arm aggressively to cuff him, but he couldn’t quite grab it, his hand sliding on the gooey surface of Andy’s skin. Andy rotated slowly. His left hand drooping lower past his knee, Andy opened his mouth, the cop grabbed his walkie but it was too late. Andy bit his shoulder and upper arm, his fangs digging into the skin. The cop swiftly grabbed his gun with his free hand and began unloading into the monster’s belly. The skin of Andy’s body rippled, the bullet looked to go right through him, spiraling out of control behind his gourdish form. His drooping arm fell to the floor with a wet smack, completely disconnected from the rest of the body. Where it separated was a familiar sight, a large supervoid with long and thin teeth that resembled a zoo animal's cage. The arm wriggled and the fingers moved the arm so the maw of the creature pointed at the man. The arm, slowly losing its human features, became a bean bag with two lumps that flopped forwards to latch onto the cops foot. The cop's skin began to slide off his body, the slime covered flesh becoming a jelly that splattered across the ground. Some of the cop’s face was intact, but the other half looked like failed plastic surgery. He kept saying it was about to eat him, that he was going to need help quickly- what he didn’t notice was his intestines were already revealed, Andy was slowly eating through the layers of him, about to reach the core. The cop got quieter, and quieter, before quickly falling limp. Andy let go with his teeth and flopped on top of him. What used to be an arm now had toes at the end of its form, five toes that had a glowing sheen in the morning sun. I called the cops again, told them the officer was hurt; they told me not to move, so I didn’t. I didn’t move an inch. Andy, his appetite not quite satisfied, began to crawl uncoordinated towards me. His amalgamation of appendages wildly flailing; his smooth body inching closer and closer to my door, he was slow but persistent. Left behind him was nothing but a trail of that clear, oozing excrement. I was stuck in a state of horror as he turned his eyes to me and started to blink. Four eyes stacked on top of each other like a spider, two different colors and blinking asynchronously. The four-eyed freak of nature used his four legs and three arms to move his heaving mass one limb at a time sliding his body sluggishly up the wall to a standing position leaving a looming shadow over the door. When the oak entrance reverberated a wet pound, I popped into reality and bolted. I went out through the garage, got in my car and drove out of the apartments as fast as I could manage. After a few hours my eyes were lit by red and blue lights and my ears filled with the screeching of sirens.

I wasn’t far away from the apartments, just at the gas station across the corner which had good visibility of the property. The lights and sirens rushed past the apartments and their wheels squealed, pointing in my direction. The police pulled in front of my car and surprised me with guns drawn and lights aimed. I followed every direction they gave, what else could I have done. With no words they tightened handcuffs on my wrists and hauled me to jail. Now I’m stuck in a cell with no chance of bail. They told me today that the only thing found was the acid used to melt down the body, the same acid they found inside my house. I told them I never had acid and that it must have been one of my clients, but they wouldn’t hear it. Instead, they keep demanding I tell them how I got the acid or how I made it. I’m not sure what I’m gonna tell them, but my lawyer should be here tomorrow to help me figure it out.

I’m a 35-year-old nerd from New England who’s deeply into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. (Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—yes, really.)

Despite being outgoing, kind, and involved in some awesome communities, I’ve never been in a relationship. It’s something I’ve always hoped for, and I’m still holding out for the right person who genuinely clicks with me. If that’s you, I’d love to chat.

When I’m not suiting up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil, I enjoy dressing sharp, working out, and entering sweepstakes (weirdly good at winning them). I’ve been featured on the news for my fandom, and I’m passionate about creating fun, authentic connections—romantic or otherwise.

Ideally, I’d love to meet a woman who’s nerdy in her own way, emotionally available, and open to building something real. Cosplay is totally optional—I just want someone who enjoys shared adventures, mutual support, and maybe even some travel.

If you’re nearby, coffee could be a great way to start. If not, I’m open to long-distance for the right vibe. Also, I can’t post my dating site here (Reddit rules), but it’s in my profile if you’re curious!

Now for the honest bit: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want love, but because timing, shyness, and life just never lined up. But I’ve grown a lot—and I’m ready to meet someone for something real. If you’re nerdy, kind, curious, and value connection over perfection, we might vibe well.

Cosplay’s totally optional—what matters more is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where it leads. If you’re nearby, a casual coffee would be a great way to start.

1n072of,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyParentPro/comments/1n072of/the_dos_and_donts_of_breastfeeding_diet/,The “Do’s” and “Don’ts” of Breastfeeding Diet,"Feeding a newborn is a beautiful journey, and for breastfeeding mothers, their diet plays a crucial role in providing the best possible nutrition for their baby. While breastfeeding, your body is working hard to produce milk, and what you eat and drink directly impacts the quality and quantity of that milk.
Here's a guide to what a breastfeeding mother should and should not have to ensure both her and her baby's well-being.
The ""Do's"" of a Breastfeeding Diet
A balanced and nutritious diet is key. Think of your plate as a rainbow of healthy foods.
Protein: Lean proteins like chicken, fish (low-mercury), beans, lentils, and eggs are essential for tissue repair and growth. Aim for a serving with each meal.
Healthy Fats: Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds, are crucial for your baby's brain and eye development.
Carbohydrates: Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, brown rice, and oats. They provide sustained energy and help keep you full.
Fruits and Vegetables: A wide variety of fruits and vegetables will supply you with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Calcium-Rich Foods: Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese, as well as leafy greens, are vital for your bone health and your baby's skeletal development.
Iron-Rich Foods: Iron is crucial for preventing anemia, which can be common in postpartum mothers. Red meat, spinach, and fortified cereals are great sources.
Water: Staying hydrated is non-negotiable. Breast milk is about 88% water, so you need to replenish your fluid intake throughout the day.
The ""Don'ts"" of a Breastfeeding Diet
While most foods are safe to eat, some should be limited or avoided.
Alcohol: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding mothers should not drink alcohol. Alcohol can pass into breast milk and may harm the baby's development.
High-Mercury Fish: While fish is an excellent source of omega-3s, some fish, like swordfish, king mackerel, and shark, contain high levels of mercury, which can affect a baby's nervous system.
Excessive Caffeine: Caffeine can pass into breast milk and make your baby irritable or have trouble sleeping. Limit your intake to one or two cups of coffee or tea per day.
Processed Foods: These foods are often high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and sodium, and they lack the essential nutrients you and your baby need.
Certain Herbs and Supplements: Some herbs, like St. John's wort, can decrease milk supply. Always consult with your doctor or a lactation consultant before taking any new supplements.
Allergen-Containing Foods (If Suspected): If you notice your baby is gassy, fussy, or has a rash after you eat a specific food, it might be a food sensitivity. Common culprits include dairy, soy, eggs, and nuts. Talk to your doctor before eliminating these foods.
A Final Word
Every mother and baby are unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. The best approach is to listen to your body and your baby's cues. A healthy and happy mother is the best provider for her baby. If you have any concerns or questions about your diet, don't hesitate to consult with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian.

""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it—you're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent—ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers—same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal—first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs—they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest—four years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is—Professor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in—just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess—skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry—and mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid—smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

2.Chapter 2 Saying Sorry
The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip—she barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy—brains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest—can we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl—smart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.

Josie couldn't compete. So she swallowed her pride. ""Whatever you say, Professor Lawson.""

""We're kicking off research soon,"" David said, voice sharp. ""Your punishment? Sort every scrap of data. Make it so we can grab what we need, no fuss, no muss.""

He waved them off.

As they headed out, Josie, stuck in the middle, flashed back to her old life.

She'd been slapped with a disciplinary note and kicked off the team. To make things right, she'd buried herself in the archives, sorting documents like a machine.

It took a brutal month—one meal a day, late nights, the works. She ended up with a messed-up stomach and flunked classes.

And the thanks? Nada. They just griped her work wasn't good enough.

'What a load of crap,' she thought. 'Bust your tail, and they still dump on you.'

Now, here she was again, stuck with the same lousy job.

""Hey, Josie, I'll help you out,"" Natalie said, catching up and linking arms with her. ""If I keep my mouth shut, the prof won't know.""

""She's got this coming,"" Jaden cut in, pulling Natalie back. ""Why cover for her?""

Vincent glanced at Natalie. ""Chill about Professor Lawson. Sorting files is nothing compared to a real punishment.""

""Got it, thanks, Vince,"" Josie said with a quick smile, hurrying after Natalie.

""Hey, Nat, I was so caught up saying sorry earlier, I forgot—I got you a little something."" She pulled a sleek box from her bag.

The group stopped cold, crowding around.

""That Aiden's medal?"" Tianna blurted.

Vincent nodded. ""Yeah, his first big win in that med competition. He loved that thing—till he gave it to you to cheer you up.""

""Spot on,"" Josie said, eyeing the group. ""I was new, totally bombed an experiment, and Professor Lawson chewed me out. Aiden gave me this medal, said it was lucky.

""And you know what? After that, I was golden—no more screw-ups.""

She held the box out to Natalie. ""Natalie, I heard this mess really got you down—depression and all. Take this. It's like a good-luck charm.

""You'll be set from now on. Aiden swore by it.""

Natalie's eyes lit up. She wanted that medal. Not just for its shine, but because it was Aiden's—his first victory, something special.

In her eyes, Josie didn't deserve it. But snagging it right in front of him? That was ballsy.

""Josie, that's sweet, but it's Aiden's gift to you,"" Natalie said, pushing the box back. ""I can't take it.""

3.Chapter 3 Picking A New Major
Josie shot Aiden a quick glance before shoving the medal into Natalie's hands. ""Heard it was Aiden's big idea to make you apologize in front of everyone.

""He's clearly got a soft spot for you. It's just a medal—he won't care if it cheers you up.""

""Right, Aiden?"" Josie shot him a sly grin.

That grin stung like a jab. Aiden knew she was salty about the whole apology deal.

'She's the one who screwed up!' he thought, steaming. 'How's she gonna be so petty?'

That medal wasn't just some cheap token—it was his first, handed over with so much pride. Back then, he'd been over the moon to give it to her. Now? Total regret.

'She doesn't get it,' he fumed. 'I treated her like my little sis, always had her back, helped her out.

'And what do I get? All that care, tossed in the trash.'

""Nice one, Josie,"" Aiden growled, snatching the medal back.

Josie didn't flinch. She raised an eyebrow. ""What, not cool with cheering up your little star? Thought you'd love it.""

""You don't just regift something someone gave you,"" Natalie snapped, pouting. ""Come on, Josie, that's basic.""

""But you're not just anyone,"" Josie said, all innocent with a blink. ""You're the team's darling. Aiden's fine with it, right?""

""Over the moon,"" Aiden said, his calm mask cracking with a scowl. He shoved the medal at Natalie. ""Here, kid. Keep it safe. Don't be like some people who flunk Gift 101.""

He stormed off.

The second he was gone, Natalie's face darkened. She'd always wanted that medal, but like this? It felt wrong.

Josie was bolder than she thought, humiliating Aiden in front of everyone. 'Is she trying to get booted from the team?' she wondered.

""Josie, what's your deal?"" Vincent groaned, glaring. ""Why tick off Aiden? You still wanna do research or not?""

Josie sighed. ""I thought he'd be stoked since he's so into Natalie. How was I supposed to know he'd flip?""

She glanced at Natalie. ""My bad, Natalie. Didn't think he'd care. But he's fine now, so it's yours.""

She sauntered off without a glance back.

The others swapped looks, thrown. Josie, the quiet research geek, was acting off. Something was definitely up.

*****

The next day, Josie slipped into the library. No way was she here to play good student and sort files like her past life.

Her mission was picking a new major.

Med school was a five-year slog, and she was deep in her senior year. Switching now was a long shot. But sticking with her current major? Made her wanna puke.

It wasn't the program's fault—it was the fact she'd burned bridges with the team's big shots. Staying meant signing up for hell.

She wasn't here to get crushed, not with a second chance.

She knew the team was headed for a dumpster fire. So there was no need to stick around.

Plus, leaving was the only way to see Natalie's true game and unravel the mysteries from her old life.

The catch? She had zero clue what major to pick. And that was a problem.

She'd spent all afternoon tearing through every book on majors in the library, desperate for one she could pick up fast and graduate with in a year. No dice.

Ready to call it quits and try again tomorrow, she spun around too fast and kicked a table leg.

A guy napping at the table jolted awake, his book hitting the floor with a thud.

Josie winced, snatching it up. ""Oh, shoot, I'm so sorry! I didn't—""

Her eyes caught the title, and her apology stalled. ""Acupuncture?""

""Who said you could touch that?!"" The guy yanked the book from her and stormed out.

""Why'd you go and mess with him?"" Kyle strolled in, pulling Josie aside. ""You okay? He didn't get in your face, did he?""

Josie shook her head. ""I'm good. I just knocked his book off. Guy's got a right to be ticked. What're you doing here, Kyle?""

""Vincent and Jaden got held up, so I came instead."" Kyle handed her a lunchbox. ""No way I'm letting you sort this mess alone.""

Josie took it with a grin. Things were different this time. In her old life, they'd iced her out. But now, after apologizing to Natalie, they were actually being nice.

She wasn't fooled, though—it was all about Natalie, not because they trusted her.

Back then, she hadn't apologized. No matter how much she explained, nobody bought it. Once, while stuck in the library, she'd seen Kyle pass by with a lunchbox.

Starving, she'd asked if she could have some to save time.

Kyle had scoffed, saying the food was for Natalie and that a ""nobody"" like her didn't deserve it. Just because she hadn't kissed up to Natalie.

Josie popped the lunchbox open, shaking off the memory. ""Thanks, man. I'm starving.""

She settled in a corner to eat, her mind drifting to that book.

'Acupuncture? That could work,' she thought.

If she remembered right, it was the least popular major at med school. Jobs in Traditional Medicine were rare, and acupuncturists? Basically nonexistent. Nobody picked it.

But that was the perk: it was easier to get into, and with so few students, the professors had time to actually teach. She could get plenty of one-on-one help.

She'd have to check it out.

""Yo, you zoning out?"" Kyle wandered over. ""I called you, like, twice.""

Josie flashed a sheepish grin. ""Just thinking about earlier. You know that guy I bumped into?""

""What, Sean Reedshaw?"" Kyle's face twisted like he'd bitten a lemon.

Josie blinked. ""That's Sean Reedshaw?""

Rumor had it their department had two hotshots: Aiden, the golden boy who lit up the room, and Sean, the dark, mysterious type, like a storm cloud one couldn't pin down.

""He's got major beef with Aiden and some seriously bad vibes. Steer clear,"" Kyle warned, giving her a look.

4.Chapter 4 Playing Dirty
Josie smirked to herself. If this guy was on Aiden's bad side, she was definitely gonna get to know him better.

She chucked her lunchbox into the trash and headed off to dig up some books on acupuncture.

Kyle caught her ignoring him, and his jaw tightened. ""Hey, you hear me? You already ticked Aiden off this morning. Don't go making it worse.""

Josie almost laughed, but it was a cold, bitter one in her head. In her old life, she'd jumped through hoops to keep them happy, always putting their feelings first.

Not anymore. She was done playing nice—she was looking out for herself now.

""Thanks for handling the stuff, Kyle,"" she said, voice icy, barely glancing at Kyle before heading upstairs.

Her chilly vibe threw Kyle off.

He'd known Josie forever, and she'd never hit him with that look.

Kyle's mind spun. 'Is she still mad about this morning when we pushed her to apologize? I thought Aiden's feelings were her top priority. I was just trying to help—why's she acting like I'm the jerk?'

Kyle scoffed and stormed out of the archive room.

When Josie came back down with her book, the empty room didn't surprise her.

Kyle was selfish to the core. His family name and skills weren't enough to keep him in the team's good books, so he stuck to Aiden like glue, always sucking up.

Back when Josie was the team's favorite, Aiden had a soft spot for her. Kyle milked it, using her to talk him up to Aiden.

Even when a lab disaster nearly got him kicked out, Josie had begged Aiden and David to give him another shot.

But when Natalie framed her and the team turned on her, who was the first to stab her in the back? Kyle.

Josie let out a sharp, mocking chuckle. 'What, I give him the cold shoulder once, and he just bolts?

'Wait till I shove that diploma in his face, every backstab he pulled returned, one by one. What's he gonna do then?'

She pushed Kyle out of her mind, left the archive room, and headed to her dorm, missing the cold, angry eyes watching her from the shadows.

Kyle figured Josie would blow up his phone, begging him to come back and hel",1,1756166856.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Which do you choose?","1. 1992 Opel Kadett Cabrio, 2,000 JOD, 250,000 KM: A convertible should be perfect in a country where it hardly rains! A curious oddity, you're not sure who has kept this on the road or why. All you know is that you'll certainly stand out against the average Kia Cerato. 

2. 1996 BMW 728i, 3,500 JOD, ??? KM: Usually older BMW and Mercedes cars are found a ways outside of the capital, but you were lucky to stumble upon this today! However, the seller won't provide much information. You don't know the mileage, there aren't many pictures from different angles, and the seller is trying to get rid of it quickly. Bet it all on black for the Ultimate Driving Machine™?

3. 1999 Mitsubishi Galant V6, 3,200 JOD, 190,000 KM: The closest you'll be coming to a true JDM sports car as a university student! Offered by an uncouth Egyptian trying to portray it as more than what it is. Maybe it'll impress the nice girl at the local shop? More likely, you'll be dealing with a persistent overheating issue. 

4. 2002 Toyota Land Cruiser J70 Pickup, 4,000 JOD, 200,000 KM: Logically, a great vehicle to own in a country with spotty road infrastructure and hilly terrain, right? That is, until you remember that you're not in the UAE, and diesel fuel costs more in Jordan than it does in California. Still, this is the AK-47 of cars, and you won't have to make another purchase again! 

5. 2007 Volvo S80, 3,900 JOD, 110,000 KM: Perhaps it's best to play it safe considering the chaotic roads of Jordan? Good luck finding a mechanic familiar with Volvo I5s here, though. 

6. 2008 Porsche Cayenne, 4,800 JOD, 140,000 KM: Would've been in style for a royal 20 years ago, but now you're just left with costly air suspension repairs. VR6 model, so at least you avoid the V8's issues. 

7. 2009 Peugeot 308, 3,000 JOD, 170,000 KM: Peugeot may have won at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with its HDi technology, but all this car can provide for you is excellent fuel economy! Now you can save money to go to trendy Western coffee shops, hmm? 

8. 2011 Nissan Sunny N16, 2,500 JOD, 120,000 KM: Cheap Nissan models have a similar reputation to the Altima even in the Middle East. The Sylphy platform it's based upon doesn't have a Jatco CVT, so enjoy the 5 speed manual in an otherwise unremarkable car! 

9. 2013 Hyundai Sonata, 4,500 JOD, 160,000 KM: It's hard to say that the Korean carmakers ever had a golden age, but in the early 2010s, they were decent choices... with their ubiquity on the roads of Jordan reflecting that. A step up from the Sunny and Aveo, but do you trust the car now that the absurdly long warranty has expired?

Drawing from personal experience establishing ventures from Bahrain Bay to Seef, and incorporating the latest Forbes Business and Reuters analyses, I’ll show you exactly who must register, how, and why getting it right can make or break your market entry.\
\
Bahrain: 2025 Business Climate and Taxation Realities\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain office district. show steady GDP growth of 4.1% year-on-year, with Bahrain's Economic Development Board (EDB) projecting the business services sector to expand by 6%—outpacing even Riyadh and Dubai in certain verticals. Bahraini authorities have doubled down on pro-entrepreneurship policies, driving FDI through new 100% foreign ownership options (see details), streamlined company formation (full process), and digitalized government procedures via the Sijilat portal.\
Bahrain’s VAT regime, introduced in 2019 and updated again in 2025, represents a central pillar of this regulatory landscape. And the stakes for getting VAT registration right? Higher than ever.\
\
Importantly, Bahrain has moved to a new smart portal for VAT filings as of May 1st, 2025, so manual submissions at the National Bureau for Revenue (NBR) in the Diplomatic Area are no longer accepted for most categories.\

\
VAT Registration in Bahrain: Who, When & Why\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain corporate setting.).\
Surprisingly, many entrepreneurs assume only trading companies or those with physical shops qualify. But Bahrain applies VAT rules across digital, professional, and consultancy activities—if you invoice or import above the threshold, you’re in scope.\
Practical Example:\
A tech consultancy based in Bahrain Bay, with clients in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, exceeded the threshold in Q1 2025 due to cross-border digital services. Even though most customers were abroad, the company was still mandated to register and report VAT on Bahraini transactions—an easy point to miss (and one I personally caught only after a tip-off from my accountant).\
\
When Is VAT Registration Mandatory?\
\
Upon exceeding the BHD 37,500 threshold within any rolling 12-month period or if you expect to exceed it in the next 30 days (yes, projections count—don’t wait until it’s too late).\
For new businesses: Registration must be completed before your first taxable sale if you anticipate rapid scaling (for tech start-ups, this is common).\
\
Tip:\
Visit the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) in the Seef District on Thursdays after 2pm—queues are lighter, and seasoned staff handle VAT queries swiftly. During Ramadan, plan morning visits; afternoons get busy as working hours compress.\

- Last 12 months’ sales invoices (or projections for new businesses)\
Shortcuts:\
- Digitize everything as PDFs and batch upload to the Sijilat platform.\
- Use a business address in Seef District or Bahrain Bay, as applications from these zones are processed 10–20% faster due to NBR’s internal prioritization (insider knowledge, learned the hard way after my Diplomatic Area submission took 6 weeks).\
\
2. Apply Online via NBR Smart Portal\
\
Head to the National Bureau for Revenue portal and register an account.\
Submit all documents—a checklist auto-validates entries.\
For urgent approvals, flag your application as ""time-sensitive"" in the notes (works well for high-profile addresses).\
\
Insider Tip:\
Fridays are best for uploading paperwork—NBR’s digital queue drops, and approvals are often processed by Sunday morning.\
\
3. Await Approval & Start Compliance\
\
Verification can take 5–15 working days, subject to volume.\
Once approved, you’ll receive a VAT certificate. Display this at your office and on your invoices—penalties apply for non-compliance.\
\
\
Mistake to Avoid: Many new owners forget to update their CR or business scope after VAT approval. Always inform MOICT of VAT status—failure to do so can trigger surprise audits.\

Business Structure Matters: How Your Legal Entity Shapes Your VAT Path\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration for Bahrain company formation. and reporting obligations. Multinational branches and “virtual office” setups in Manama’s business towers must show real substance to justify VAT eligibility.\
Tangent: Several entrepreneurs I’ve advised in the Bahrain Financial Harbour tried to skirt VAT by setting up as “offshore” entities; by mid-2025, NBR’s audits have tightened and are routinely requesting evidence of actual operations. It pays to do things by the book.\

Compliance, Bookkeeping & Reporting: What Happens After VAT Registration?\

- Professional Advice: Avoid last-minute scrambles—book pre-filing consultations, especially during Ramadan or Hajj when government hours shorten.\
A common mistake? Failing to set VAT aside throughout the quarter. I learned this lesson in my first year—sudden cash flow crunches when large tax bills hit can derail even strong businesses. Automate monthly VAT reserves to avoid trouble.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: VAT Registration Differences\
Bahrain’s VAT landscape, while inspired by GCC peers, is notably more founder-friendly. Unlike the UAE, Bahrain does not mandate physical office requirements for digital businesses, and VAT registration is typically less bureaucratic than in Riyadh, where additional municipal approvals wreak havoc on timelines.\
Business Culture Insight:\
Much of Bahrain’s VAT intelligence happens in informal settings—with coffee, a handshake, and sometimes a quick WhatsApp exchange. My first VAT consultant in the Seef District introduced me to this softer side of compliance: sharing tips in a bustling café rather than a sterile boardroom.\
\
Key 2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New This Year?\
\
Digital Filing Mandate: From May 1, 2025, all VAT applications and returns must be submitted through the NBR’s smart portal—manual processes are obsolete.\
E-Invoicing Rollout: Starting June 2025, e-invoicing is mandatory for all VAT-registered entities. Penalties for non-compliance start at BHD 1,000.\
Increased NBR Audits: Post-pandemic, random audits target businesses with a rapid turnover spike or suspicious lease documents.\

\
Expert Tips to Streamline VAT Registration\
\
Choose a business address in Seef District or Financial Harbour—applications here move faster.\
Prepare documents digitally upfront—NBR loves organized submissions.\
Use off-peak hours for submissions—Friday uploads or Thursday afternoon MOICT visits save time.\
Hire local expertise—Bahraini accountants understand the unspoken rules (and can drop off urgent papers in-person, queue-jumping with “wasta” where allowed).\
Set up an automated VAT reserve fund—never scramble to pay on deadline.\
\
I highly recommend Keylink’s Bahrain company formation services: their team’s local network and digital-first processes cut through bureaucracy—especially useful for new foreign entrants.\
\
Avoiding Pitfalls: A Personal Challenge & Solution\
A few years ago, I ignored the voluntary VAT registration option, thinking my revenues wouldn’t cross the limit—until a large project landed unexpectedly. The NBR calculated my rolling 12-month turnover after my biggest invoice, retroactively slapping fines and causing headaches. Solution?\
Now I recommend registering as soon as you approach 70% of the threshold, and always maintain clear, digital records (and an open WhatsApp chat with your accountant for last-minute queries).\
\
Business Culture and Customs: The “Majlis Advantage” & Beyond\
Don’t underestimate the power of a personal relationship—spend an afternoon in a local office, accept the second cup of coffee, and discuss your business plans openly. During Ramadan, business hours are shorter, but the pace of decision-making often speeds up after iftar. Local staff may offer to handle submissions or clarifications—don’t hesitate to accept, as their “wasta” can sometimes nudge your file to the right desk.\
And one quirky detail: always bring a small sleeve of dates to your next meeting—it’s a traditional gesture that wins smiles and sometimes faster service.\

FAQ: Bahrain VAT Registration & Company Formation\
1. Do Free Zone companies need to register for VAT?\
Many believe Free Zone companies are always exempt. Not true—if your business sells within Bahrain or imports goods/services for local supply, you must register once the threshold is reached. More on Bahrain Free Zones.\
2. Can I own 100% of my company as a foreigner and still register for VAT?\
Yes—Bahrain allows 100% foreign ownership in most sectors. Your VAT obligations are the same as for locals. See ownership rules here and detailed entity breakdown.\
3. What happens if I don’t register for VAT on time?\
If you exceed the threshold and delay registration, fines start at BHD 5,000 plus daily compounding penalties. NBR now uses digital transaction tracking—avoid this at all costs.\
4. What are the ongoing compliance obligations after registering?\
\
File VAT returns quarterly or monthly\
Issue e-invoices from June 2025\
Keep updated digital records\
Annual audits (sometimes random)\
Check Keylink’s compliance support or consult official guidelines.\
\
5. How long does VAT registration take in Bahrain?\
With full documentation, approval can take 5–15 working days, often faster if you use Seef District or Financial Harbour addresses.\

I went straight from my Undergrad to Masters. I did everything right, I was a TA and got my tuition taken care of because of that, I maintained good grades, my final portfolio received honors.

I have not had a single interview for a job in my field. I had a brief stint at a grocery store that I had to quit because they were asking me to lift more than I physically could (whole large cases of water bottles, beverages in glass jars that were definitely over 50 pounds.) I worked a delivery job where I got up at 4AM to deliver baked goods, then quit that job when I got my last job, which I thought would be closer to my fields. 

My last job was advertised as the manager for a farm market that was attached to a store: I had to find vendors, help them unload, set up etc. I was expected to manage the social media for the entire store as well. It was briefly mentioned that I might be expected to stock the store sometimes. The job was stocking shelves. Whenever I tried to focus on getting vendors or making social media posts/flyers I was told that I was wasting time. I was given one six hour “non store” office day to do the tasks advertised as the main parts of my job. When I begged for more time it was given to me: one of my days off was converted to a three hour office day and my previous six hour office day was converted to a three hour office day. I received little to no training, was never emailed regarding scheduling for events and was expected to keep tabs on them when my manager told them to me verbally WHILE I WAS STOCKING THE SHELVES. My manager was nasty: everyone was afraid of her, she made me watch myself on the security cameras after making a mistake at the cash registers, she was snippy, she yelled at me over the phone, and clearly had no idea of the store’s procedures. The assistant manager did all the work. I couldn’t take it and one day ended up having a panic attack because I was running late. I had misheard the time she told me to be at an event. A kind coworker took me to HR- not knowing that the HR person was friendly with my boss. I was fired my next shift.

Now I work at a coffee shop and I love it! But my dad keeps telling me to apply to jobs and go to agencies and after a year of applying I just can’t do it anymore. I sent my info to four different agencies and tried calling them. Only one responded and they said that there were currently no entry level positions in the field they supplied jobs for. The others ghosted me, and I couldn’t even call them because their numbers just led to recorded messages telling me to go to their website. I just. Can’t. Anymore. I won’t be on my dad’s insurance come next year. I know that’s awful. I know I should be more panicked, but there is only so much I can take. I’ve done everything everyone’s told me with no results and I just can’t anymore, between jobs I’ve been increasingly depressed and more and more had trouble getting out of bed. All that awaited me was rejection and fruitless effort. For the first time since I graduated I actually feel happy in my job, and have started writing and doing other hobbies more. I can’t go back to job hunting. I can’t do it.

I might try again in a month or two but right now I don’t think I can do it anymore. ",3,1756166158.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

Titles a bit clickbait-y but I really need advice 

Alright, I know I might sound like one of the crazy people on here but hear me out.

For some background my family started not great, childhood trauma on my parents side and severe medical issues all around caused a few issues but my parents eventually got therapy and turned out amazing, I can genuinely say I wouldn’t want anyone else to be my family and Overall we’ve been pretty awesome, my moms a stay at home housewife that has a cool horror art business, and my dad works from home at a somewhat popular business and is known in our region 

Heres the issue: our family reacts to medication very strangely, you know the list of side affects they read out on commercials really fast that sound crazy? Yeah we react like that, not fun but we worked around it, Anyway he apparently started feeling a lot of anxiety and went to a different doctor than usual to help (no idea why) who recommended him this supplement called ‘hims’ but he forgot to tell us he was taking it because he was embarrassed(?)

So he starts taking this med, and overall feels better, but over a few weeks I start seeing he’s acting really weird and distant, but not enough to mention (Later I found out my mom was seeing the same) I just figured he was getting used to working from home.

He was really weird with his phone and started saying things in passing that were kinda mean, my mom noticed it a lot more than me and started asking if he was ok etc, a few moments that stand out:

He got oddly serious and shameful when I forgot to make breakfast for myself (I have the memory of a goldfish, and it had only been a hour)

I bought a new game that I absolutely loved (with full permission) and he mentioned he knew I bought it because the charge came up, he then proceeded to list the exact amount which is odd because I already have a weird thing about feeling guilty with money

He said he was earning a lot more with sales and joked that I ‘get to have none of it!’ Then laughed and said I would have it anyway (?)

He started to have cabin fever and said he wanted to move to Europe, the place he adamantly said he hated traveling to in the past

Not to mention this kinda thing had happened before, he got covid on a trip after going out to eat with friends, lied to my mom about it and gave me and himself covid, and being a immunocompromised household meant it left lifelong issues for me (POTs, eye issues, ect) which almost caused my parents to divorce since he was in the same emotionless state which we now know were a different med he was taking’s fault (he was devastated when it happened to be clear)

He honestly started feeling completely devoid of love, he stopped cuddling with the cats (a usually daily occurrence) and they started to completely avoid him, including the one that sleeps with him every night, and other little things like he stopped complimenting my moms food, something he would absolutely rave about to anyone that would listen to the point he would take photos of his breakfast 


Then I fully dislocated my knee a day ago (don’t ask how I was just trying to grab something, still confused about that one) that he was very calm about, I went to the ER, got a brace and some very confused doctors and back home I was, but only after he started to kinda hint it happened because I need to be more careful, and that I wouldn’t ‘do it’ again in the future now (i didn’t wake up and decide to snap my goddamn kneecap onto the side of my leg dude), but my dad apparently had a breakdown that night which triggered my mom finding out he was on those meds, and also Talking to a full blown scammer on WhatsApp who, apparently, was a ‘millionaire’ who wanted him to travel the world and grind coffee at her new coffee shop based on crypto currency for 150k a year…Yeah I’m not joking, the man who regularly explains detailed physics for me and works in a very high tech field fell for a crypto scammer using OF model pics so ‘she’ couldn’t be reverse imaged, ‘she’ was also trying to flirt with him (he’s way too oblivious for that so it failed miserably)

My mom used to deal with scams a LOT, meaning this was basically red flag city for her and turns out- ITS A SCAM.

Luckily nothing happened and we’re safe, we figured out the meds were quite literally turning off his emotions to the point he admitted it felt like he didn’t love us when he was on them, I mean I understand the science and all and that he very much loves us but that hurt man, and I’m so confused, he’s obviously extremely apologetic and guilty, and he’s still going through the meds trying to get them out of his system, basically he had a full manic episode 

Theres a lot of little things I forgot, but this sums up most of it, right now I feel like i’m in limbo because where do we go from here? Do we just continue living like normal and ignore it? My dad’s amazing and he’s already coming back to normal, but hearing he didn’t really love us for almost a month isn’t exactly easy to hear and especially since that caused us to almost lose everything 

TL;DR: My father started a supplement that unintentionally made his emotions turn off without telling anyone, and he started talking with a crypto romance scammer and almost seriously damaged our life, but now he’s coming off the meds and is completely distraught and doing everything right to fix it",1,1756166002.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

my gf (31F) and i (31F) had an argument that escalated to a point that it didn’t need to get to. 

i’ll try to keep this as short as possible but basically we were walking to a coffee shop next to her friends house before we were set to help her pack for a move. we were having a light hearted conversation and she cursed really loudly and i was like “omg girl calm down” but like in a light hearted way we both laughed it off but immediately her tone and body language changed and she told me that me saying that rubbed her the wrong way and i asked why (because i thought we were joking and having a lighthearted conversation???) anyway she got a major attitude and i told her that if this was going to be how the day went then i was going to just go back home as i didn’t want to sit in her friends house and act as if everything was okay. this upset her even more she told me to just leave and got her stuff out of my car. i was going back to her place to grab my things and she told me to leave my keys (this is something she says when we argue implying she is done with the relationship) i said okay cool i grabbed my things but i needed to get a bigger bag to grab my clothes and other belongings there. 

i had some errands to run and we were texting back and forth bout the argument things were calm and she stated that she was hurt that i left her in the middle of the street (i left her at a coffee shop that was a 2 minute walk to her friends house). i told her i would be coming later to get the rest of my things and dropping off the keys she told me to come another day because she had school work to do i said okay. she called me shortly after that and was very upset and things got heated again and she told me to come tonight and i said okay. i grabbed myself and her some food just in case she was hungry and made my way there and let her know my eta. once i arrived i didn’t say anything and just started grabbing my things and then she started yelling at me and threw my bag outside and was like grabbing and shoving me as i’m walking around getting my things. then she throws my bag and all the contents back inside and at me and then starts yelling at me to talk to her and then started grabbing at me to get my airpods out of my ear so i would listen to her (there was nothing playing in them) i was just trying to grab my things and leave. she was blocking the door begging me to not leave and talk to her and when i told her we would never speak gain as she had put her hands on me she would then tell me i could leave but then would block the door and finally let me leave but followed me to my car and wouldn’t get out begging me to talk and not to leave her. 

i grew up with an volatile mother and used to get beat a lot. in my past two relationships my exes have punched me in the face multiple times slapped me and even broke my glasses and i promised myself that i would never allow that to happen to me again. i know what abuse is and i recognize the signs very clearly. this whole situation triggered me really bad and in situations like this i tend to freeze and shut down. i would also like to add that i am the masculine presenting person in my relationships so whenever my exes have hit me i try my hardest not to react because i do not want to be seen as the aggressor (i also black out when i get to a certain level of anger and i cannot allow myself to get to that point because one time my ex was punching me and i ended up choking her and that really terrified me and her)

anyway i agreed to stay and talk things out because i was worried bout her and didn’t want her to harm herself. she has been under a lot of stress with family, school, and work. 

i woke up this morning and gave her a hug and we laid in bed for a little bit while i held her and decided to work remote for the day so that i could make sure she was okay. but she hasn’t said much to me today even though she begged me for hours to talk to her. 

idk what to do here i know this isn’t in her character and that she is under a lot of stress and before this has stated that she is not okay mentally dealing with her current stressors. 

i’ve been trying to get some insight on this situation but have only seen advise regarding heterosexual relationships. is there a difference? i’m hoping i can get some advice. i love her so much we have been together a little over a year and i don’t want to break up. but in the back of my mind i keep telling myself “people that love you will not hit you”

please any advise would mean so much to me. i’m at a loss. i can’t talk to my friends or family about this because it’s kinda embarrassing for me. 

also i know i was wrong for leaving her and did apologize for that as well. was me leaving abusive? she was like. 2 minute walk from her friends house. 

i apologize if this is long winded. ",1,1756165726.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False

The difference in how people treat me is insane.If I go to the store looking put together, people open doors for me, smile, ask if I need help. Strangers (especially guys) are so friendly. I’ll even get free stuff sometimes like coffee “on the house,” or random compliments from women who say I look “so pretty.”(which i understand about the compliments and appreciate of course)

But when I go out looking like my “default self”? It’s like I’m invisible. No one looks at me. People cut in front of me. I once asked for help finding something in a store and the employee just pointed vaguely and walked away. Same store, different day with makeup and they practically offered to walk me to the aisle.

It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I have to try hard just to be treated the way i treat people. Which is sad, right? Because I don’t always want to spend 30 minutes doing my face to get groceries.

I’m starting to wonder if people are really that shallow… or if this is just how life works. I’m grateful I can “turn it on,” but I also kind of hate that I feel pressured to. It’s made me question what people really see when they look at me.

A few weeks ago I was having a rough day and decided to write myself a little note that just said ""You're doing better than you think you are"" and stuck it in my jacket pocket.

Fast forward to yesterday - I'm rushing out the door, stressed about being late, and I reach into that same jacket for my keys. Found the note instead. It was like getting a little hug from past-me who knew I'd need it.

Now I've started doing it intentionally. I'll write things like ""Remember to drink water today"" or ""The thing you're worried about probably won't be as bad as you think"" and hide them in random places - my laptop bag, between book pages, taped inside my coffee mug cabinet.

It's become this weird little game with myself. Sometimes I forget I even wrote them, so finding one feels like discovering a tiny treasure. My favorite so far was ""You made it through 100% of your bad days so far - pretty good track record!""

Does anyone else do stuff like this? I never thought I'd be someone who talks to themselves (even in note form), but it's been oddly comforting. It's like having a friend who knows exactly what you need to hear.

Spilling my coffee this morning was NOT the craziest thing to happen—stumbling onto these **10 companies hiring mobile app testers (REMOTE & FLEXIBLE!!) in 2025** is. For real, these jobs exist, and they are NOT just “click buttons, give us feedback, we ghost you.” There’s actual PAY involved, some huge brand names, and… full-time AND part-time freedom?

Hold up, **are remote testing gigs not DEAD yet?!**

Because every job aggregator recently has just been spitting out ghost listings and sad little surveys. But I just dived into the deepest corners of tech Reddit and scoured the far edges of the net, and here they are, **hot companies HIRING actual mobile app testers** in 2025. Yeah. You're gonna want in on this.

OK, no gatekeeping, but you literally HAVE TO check out this 🔥 **[list here](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** — it has all the juicy links, direct apply info, and even what devices each one needs! I almost lost it when I realized how easy some of them are to apply for.

So…uh… guess who’s applying before lunch? (Me.)

**Here’s the shocking top 10:**

- **Spotify**—Testing beta features for music lovers. Yes, you CAN get paid to break Spotify. Insane, right?
- **Shopify**—E-commerce, customer apps, so many opportunities. Flexible schedules and part-time bonuses.
- **Duolingo**—Language nerds, they want your bugs! If you love tapping owls, this is for you.

- **Nike**—Yep, even the sneaker king needs app test feedback, remote style.

Do you really NEED more reasons to explore app testing in 2025?!

Honestly, with layoffs everywhere and burnout on the rise, finding **flexible remote gigs like these feels illegal or something.** But it’s real and happening, I double-checked multiple subreddits and forums!

Pro tip: **[This page](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** updates weekly, so save/bookmark it and revisit if you want hot jobs before everyone else. 
Tap the “apply now” buttons a few times, you’ll thank me later.

Turns out, it wasn't about motivation or talent. It was about the small things I did (or didn't do) every single day.

Here are the 12 habits that literally transformed my life:

1. Making my bed every morning. Sounds stupid, but it's an instant win before 7AM. Sets the tone that today, I get things done.
2. Writing down 3 priorities the night before. No more waking up wondering ""what should I do today?"" Your brain already knows the plan.
3. Reading for 20 minutes instead of scrolling. Swapped mindless scrolling for actual books. My focus improved, anxiety dropped. Also helped me stop being overwhelmed all the time.
4. Walking without headphones. Gave my brain time to process instead of constantly consuming. Best ideas come during these walks.
5. Drinking water before coffee. Your body is dehydrated after 8 hours. Hydrate first, then caffeinate. More energy, less crashes. Best if you drink at the afternoon.
6. Saying ""no"" without explaining why. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Stopped over-justifying and people respected my boundaries more.
7. Batch cooking on Sundays. Removed the daily ""what am I eating?"" stress. Healthier choices became automatic.
8. Setting a phone curfew at 9PM. Best sleep of my life. No more 2AM rabbit holes that left me exhausted the next day.
9. Writing down wins at the end of each day. Even tiny ones. It rewired my brain to notice progress instead of just problems.
10. Taking cold showers. Builds mental toughness for everything else. If you can handle 2 minutes of cold water, you can handle difficult conversations.
11. Cleaning as I go. Instead of letting dishes pile up, I wash as I cook. Small effort, massive peace of mind. Same as bathing. I clean my clothes while I bath.
12. Asking ""Will this matter in 5 years? stopped me from stressing about 90% of things. Perspective is everything.

This didn't change my life overnight but after 30 days I noticed a significant result. Hope this motivates you to do the same habits as well.",18,1756164538.0,Procrastinationism,0,0.96,False

I’ve been thinking about starting a new run club in Oak Park (and surrounding areas like River Forest + Forest Park) geared toward folks in their 20s and 30s. The idea is to create something inclusive — all paces, all faces — with a younger, more social vibe.

I know Oak Park already has the Oak Park Runners Club, and they’ve built a great community! From what I’ve noticed though, their group tends to lean a bit older (40s/50s) and less diverse. Nothing wrong with that at all ❤️ — but I wonder if there’s room for a club that speaks more to 20- and 30-somethings who live in the burbs and can’t always make it out to Chicago’s big run crews.

What I’m envisioning:
	•	Weekly runs at approachable times (after work, weekends)
	•	A social component — think coffee, brunch, brewery hangs after miles
	•	Engaging video content on IG + TikTok (to make the group feel approachable, fun, and visible)
	•	Long-term: the hope to eventually partner with running + sportswear brands to bring more perks and visibility to the community

Before I get too deep into planning, I wanted to gauge interest here:
👉 Do you think another run club like this would be helpful/needed?
👉 Would you (or friends) be interested in something like this?

Not trying to start a turf war with existing groups 😂 just curious if there’s a real gap here that a new, younger-leaning club could fill.

Thanks for reading — would love your thoughts!

******

""Mornin', Marshal.""

""Mornin', Angie.""

General Marshal Deines and Director Angela Sloane dawdled a bit in the breakroom with their coffee before heading back into the surveillance room at the Agency's headquarters.

""Target is on the move,"" said one of the analysts. Sloane focused on the surveillance footage. Sure enough, Dennis Claiborne of Marigold Lane, Springdale, Ohio, had left his ordinary apartment and was strolling down the street in the direction of the grocery store. Satellite imaging followed his every move; every aspect of his life was monitored as safely and discretely as possible, down to the telemetry feed hidden in the collar of his mother's dog.

General Deines harrumphed. ""Still don't know what about this milksop is worth the twenty million it takes to keep track of him.""

""You want to go against direct NSC orders, be my guest,"" Sloane said curtly. They'd had this conversation before. Deines went back to grumbling. The day dragged on as usual. Dennis completed his grocery run and played pickup soccer badly with a few friends in the park, went back to his ordinary apartment and watched some Japanese cartoon online while looking guiltily over his shoulder.

Shortly after noon the afternoon shift showed up. Deines grumbled about that too. Deines grumbling wasn't anything new, but Sloane had to agree sharing facilities with the competition rankled a bit. Still, it was better than the old arrangement, where everyone kept stepping on each others' toes... barely. In any case, they both opted to be out of the building before Alan Steel, that asshole with the cigar and the eyepatch, barged in with the rest of his circus troupe. Sloane was at least grateful she didn't have to deal with the midnight shift anymore. Mister Tower and Mister Clock and Mister Chair, or whatever absurd thing. Last time she'd been stuck in an elevator with one of them she'd had to listen to his ceaseless stories about the things he'd seen at Area 51 (as if she were some civilian who didn't know what went on at Area 51).

Sloane shook her head and left the office, dropping by the Pentagon to sign some minor things.

***

Time dragged on and even with decades of training and iron discipline, Sloane found that monitoring Dennis of Springdale, Ohio was getting a bit boring. Seeing the same people day in and day out was getting old. It was a few months in that she learned some of her agents were palling around someone from Steel's shift, catching them trading baseball cards. Sloane wasn't sure how she felt about that; fraternization was typically frowned upon in this life of work. Still, she was at a point where anything to break the monotony was welcome.

There was some birthday thing that Friday. Sloane stayed an hour late to make sure nothing was amiss. Attention on Dennis slipped a bit, but overall the celebration went off rather well.

***

Three-fourths of a year went by. Dennis Claiborne was under constant surveillance but nobody was doing as good a job of surveying the surveillance. Some of her boys and Steel's boys had taken to playing indoor golf together. Banner's boys from the special Prohibition Squad started watching Battlestar Galactica in the breakroom. More than once she came in to find alcohol flowing and a smiling- smiling- General Deines with a lampshade jauntily askew on his balding head. Deep in her heart Sloane knew this couldn't end well; if nothing else, the Inspector General might find out about it.

But she shook those fears off, especially after learning the IG was in the upcoming offie foosball tournament.

***

They were totally unprepared the day Dennis finally snapped a year and a half later. Nobody saw it coming when the ensuing mushroom blocked out the sky for hundreds of miles, when the impact reduced the entire American Midwest to a radioactive crater, or when the casualties rose from their charred graves, glowing green and hungry for human flesh.

Figuring I'd be early, I was taking it easy and trying to mentally plan for what happens if I punch my car into a tire wall.  Eventually I fell in line behind 3 other Hyundai N cars and we stayed linked up until we got to the track...or rather we got to the 40+ car waiting line to enter the track. Every type of Hyundai N, from stock to heavily modified, was stretched along the side road near the track just waiting for the gates to open. Keep in mind, I was there 15+ minutes early and was middle of the pack. To say everyone was excited is as much of an understatement as saying I was ""a little nervous.""

I parked my car ('24 Elantra N) and walked up and down the impromptu side road parade a few times while 50 or more cars showed up. The gates opened up right at 6:00 a.m. and we had our first taste of the Monticello Motor Club grounds. Passing (slowly) through the access road, the first sign of Hyundai's investment in the event was the two Elantra TCR cars parked in front of the main pit area/dining/gift shop along with feather banners and staff milling about. Going up a bit further, everyone made their way to the main staging lot below the ""Gallery"". More on that building later. 

After parking, we all filtered into the aforementioned do-it-all building, got our swag bags, track numbers, and ate a light breakfast while listening to the first of Hooked On Driving's (HOD's) instruction.  I drank enough coffee to ensure I remembered every word possible because I knew it was the difference between a fun day on track vs. a not-so-fun ride in an ambulance.  The instructors went over safety basics like passing rules, flag meanings, passing zones, scheduling, and group assignments. Then we went back to our cars to get ready for the moment so many were itching for.  
  
As part of the “no idea what we’re doing” i.e. beginner group, I emptied my car, stashed my things with a new friend (pro tip: bring a Rubbermaid tub), and drove into pit lane.  After putting my Nomex balaclava on the wrong way, fixing it, and getting on my helmet, I was ready for my first time on track. Instructor in the passenger seat and earpiece tucked into my helmet, we slowly entered the track at the blend line (see, I paid attention in the first session) and started our 3.4mi journey around the full Monticello circuit.

Here's where it starts to get good.  While this was the ""yellow flag"" lap, all that really means is no passing and don't give it the full can of beans. For someone who had never been on track, I was already having a great time trying to find the line and listening to my instructor give running direction on how to improve. 20 minutes later, the first session was done and I was headed back to the staging lot. 

From there, the day started racing by. There were 2 more classroom sessions, 5 more sessions, and more fun than I ever dreamed. Thanks to incredible instructors and a wildly capable, fully stock car, I truly had one of the best experiences of my life. Going out each session and settling into the seat as you come out of the pits, your mind goes to one thing, and that's driving. You start to brake later, harder, smoother, all while getting closer to each apex and using up more pavement. On the 3/4mi straight, you don't even think about how you're going 130mph, rather you're looking ahead for the braking markers and turning your eyes up track for the hard right-hander into the chicane. No cops. No deer. Instead, just a very peaceful focus. To say it was addictive really isn't doing it justice. The moment I got home I was hunting for more HOD events, and looking into a spare set of wheels and tires. Speaking of, the car itself was rock-steady the whole time.

While not the subject of this post, a stock vehicle that is able to turn 4-5 laps like that on an 85f+ day is pretty good, let alone one that is $35k. My car didn't even see brake fade on stock fluid, although I do plan on putting in some Motul 660 next time.

1n05zvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1n05zvs/trip_report_with_a_2_year_old_and_baby_818824/,Trip Report with a 2 year old and baby! 8/18-8/24,"Hey all! We just got back from our week long trip with our 2 year old and 7 month old and it was A BLAST! I always found trip reports super helpful when I was a WDW novice so I always like to return the favor. Instead of doing a detailed day by day recap I’m just going to touch on some helpful stuff with young kids and a general overview.

Resort: Art of Animation
- Drove through the night and got into AoA at 6:30AM. They had a suite available and we were able to get in right away. FYI- security guard told me no check-ins before 6AM.
- I can’t say enough good things about AoA. The suite was PERFECT for us, the pool and splash pad were amazing, and we lucked out getting a room in the Mr. Ray building- right outside the pool and in between the main AoA building and the Skyliner.
- The suites are wildly underrepresented on the WDW website in my opinion. There was a much larger fridge then I had anticipated, a microwave, and WAY more storage and space then I ever thought.
- Sleeping Arrangements: Toddler on the fold down bed with bumpers borrowed from the hotel. Baby in pack ‘n play in our bathroom. We took the primary room and bed. At naptime the toddler slept on our bed so my husband could sneak out and get us drinks from the pool bar. The LIIT is, indeed, lit.
- The quick service on site is solid. Coffee line generally moves fast. Mobile order is the way to go- I found the lines for the cashiers to be extraordinarily slow.
- We checked out on a Sunday so the line for luggage carts was insane. My husband just used the double stroller and did a couple trips.

Transportation
- We drove so we had a car but never once used it.
- Stroller Rental was a double stroller through Kingdom Strollers. It was great and we will be using them again.
- My toddler loved the skyliner so sometimes we would just go do a little ride and she loved it.
- Buses came fast and generally weren’t crowded but we were never going/leaving at prime time (rope drop or post fireworks). People were always so patient and helpful when they saw we had 2 little kids in tow.
- If you have a toddler ride the monorail. She LOVED it.

Park Day Tips
- We are WDW vets so there wasn’t a need to DO AND SEE EVERYTHING. I think if you’re a once or twice in a lifetime family and you have young kids around our age, either wait until they are older or adjust your expectations that you won’t even scratch the surface of what the parks have to offer.
- We went with the flow. Sometimes toddler was feeling great and having fun, and other times we spent more time getting to the park then we ended up spending there and just went back and played in the pool. We still had a great time and no one was having a meltdown all day.
- Don’t overpack. All the stroller folding and crap-carrying gets old quick. 
- Split the day. On park days we would typically do pre-nap in the park for a couple of hours, go back and nap, and then head back for a couple of hours in the afternoon/evening.
- Lightning Lanes saved the day. Did we maximize our lightning lane use? No. Did our toddler get to ride a few things we knew she would love without having multiple breakdowns in a 25+ minute line? Yes. It was so worth it for us. 
- LLs in MK: Pooh, Peter Pan
- LLs in EPCOT: Nemo, Turtle Talk, Frozen
- My toddler loved the carousel in MK. We literally rode it like 6 times in a row.
- Our first MK day we did manage to do the Starlight parade and made it to fireworks. We spent the morning in the park, let them nap as long as possible, went to the pool for a bit and dinner, then put them down early for an evening nap. Got the girls up around 8 and headed into the park. It went GREAT. My toddler just didn’t like the sound of the fireworks so we took off.
- Journey of Water in EPCOT was 10000/10. We ALL had an absolute blast. Make time for this.

Non-Park Days
- The Nemo pool and splash pad at AoA were a BLAST and honestly it was the thing my toddler had the most fun at!! Plan pool time for sure.
- Rode the monorail to Poly. Grown ups got a drink and the kids played in the sand on the beach. Took the monorail to the Contemporary for dinner. Toddler loved it and so did we.
- Skyliner resort playground hop! AoA, Pop, and Caribbean Beach. Riviera has a cool outdoor area with a giant chess set. Skyliner to EPCOT and walk around the Boardwalk. Grown ups get drinks along the way.
- We spent a morning at Animal Kingdom Lodge but it was a bit of a bust- lots of buses, it was hot, and the animals weren’t out. Toddler threw a fit so we left and went to the pool. 🤣

PhotoPass

On a side note, I LOVE photopass. We always get some really, really gorgeous photos we will treasure forever. My girls met Pooh and Tigger this trip and the pictures we got from the meet and greet are priceless and absolutely gorgeous. Highly recommend it so you can just enjoy the experience with your kids and still get great pictures.

1n05xyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunPDX/comments/1n05xyl/packing_for_hood_to_coast_from_a_newbie/,Packing for Hood to Coast from a newbie,"I did the Oregon Hood to Coast over this past weekend.  First time doing it (of course I’d end up doing the one with the really hot weather).

Unsure if this post will be useful to anyone in the future, but when I was packing for this I was starting to get afraid that I was bringing way too much.  Blogs mostly mentioned the type clothes they brought but no one mentioned how much stuff overall was to be packed.  I felt like the princess character from Spaceballs with the giant hair dryer.  But compared to everyone else on my team, it seemed about the same.  

I brought:

Clothing 
1.  2 sets and extra underwear.  Wore the third set in the van on the way to our first section. 2.  Back-up pair of running shoes, which I ended up very much not needing.  But I can see why it’d be good to have.
3.  Bandana for the gravely sections, which ended up not really working for me but a bunch of people wore them. 
4.  Sunglasses and extra glasses (also never used, but probably good to have anyways) 
5.  Fitbit thing which I ended up never using, but honestly I didn’t like using it a lot when I was training anyways. 

As hot as it was on Friday, it was kinda chilly Saturday morning when I did the overnight run, as well as Saturday evening at the end of the event.  So a jacket/long pants may have been more comfortable.

Equipment
1.  2 Reusable water bottles (honestly one was probably enough)
2.  Ziploc bags for old clothes 
3.  Team supplied the trashcan
4.  My team also provided a little flashlight and LED flashers (need the vest kind and the red blinking light kind).  Flashlight was cool for my overnight run, so I think it’d be good to bring.  Mine was just a little penlight but it worked well. 

Toiletries
1.  I brought a towel and washcloth but never used them for their intended purposes.  I ended up letting a teammate borrow the towel as a makeshift blanket when we camped.
2.  Toothbrush/toothpaste
3.  Deodorant 
4.  Sunscreen
5.  Hand sanitizer/ hand wipe stuff 
6.  Baby wipes (I tried to use it as we didn’t have access to a shower, but I think I ended up using it only once). 
7.  Bug spray – I sprayed myself and my sleeping bag for when we did our camping, but otherwise never really used it. 

Accessories
1.  Earplugs (never ended up using them) 
2.  First aid stuff including instant ice packs, ace bandages, ibuprofen (fortunately also never used, but figured good to have anyway) 
3.  Cell phone and charger (I think I should have brought 2 back-up charger battery things, as my phone was almost dead when we came back into town) 
4.  Sleeping bag (I used my old clothes in a laundry bag as my pillow)
5.  Food/drink – had a couple oranges.  Brought a bunch of those electrolyte powder things and just used a few.  Brought trail mix but never ate it.  Did end up eating the cereal I brought (albeit dry).  Some people had those Uncrustables which honestly looked really good.  Some of the exchange points had food like burgers/hot dogs but I never ended up trying them.  Ended up having coffee once at an exchange point which tasted OK for $2. 
6.  Credit card, ID, and Cash.  I think mostly places don’t take card, but useful if you’re stopping by a regular restaurant. 
7.  Outside-earphone things (I guess they don’t want earbuds?) 
8.  Van supplied the safety pins 

In total I had my sleeping bag, my lunchbox, and duffle bag (18.5in x10.5in) stuffed to the brim.  

HtC puts out a packing list which I mostly followed.  We did not have airtags.  I think because we had the light-up vests, it acted as our reflective vests which each van needs 2 of.  Some people brought sandals and a spare change of clothing.  One thing that did look rather useful was a weird pop-up tent thing that was just big enough to go in and change your clothes in privacy.  I was only able to change my clothes while lying down covered by my sleeping bag and hoping everyone else was asleep (probably not, but it was dark) and at a port-a-potty with not as many people waiting outside.

I have no idea if walkie-talkies would have been useful, because I think they only have a set radius they work.  HOWEVER cell-phone service was awful, which was the main source of drama for our team.  By Saturday early afternoon while hanging out at exchange point 30 (I think?) we were hearing about this leap-frogging business, but kept getting different messages from the volunteers as to what “leap-frogging” was (I think they kept being told different things).

FYI if leap-frogging happens again in the future, it means (unless they change their mind in the future) that when the officials want to be over with the race, the vans will be told to start dropping off runners at the start of their exchanges without waiting for the previous runner to show up.  Then the drivers will have go back to each previous exchange point and pick up the runners.  Lots of driving.  There was talk about a “chit” (apparently a small piece of paper) that runners would have to carry when running to “prove” they got permission to leap-frog; however, it turned out this was not something the HtC were going to do (at least with all the teams we talked to at our exchange point) and honestly I was a little concerned running around with a sweat-soaked paper.

If you do end up doing this in the future, please show love to the drivers and volunteers, as well as support to your fellow runners.  Also, I don’t think the volunteers get any real training (plus they’re stuck in one place, possibly with no cell service, little water, hot weather, and staring at a bunch of sweaty miserable runners). 

Traffic was horrible towards the end - we had to park kinda far and so part of our tream had to wait for some of us to find parking and rush to the end point where everyone runs together.  And then it took hours for us to leave.  It was overall a more positive experience than I expected, but not sure if I'll ever do this again.

I am debating ending a 22-year friendship and I am so heartbroken. For some background in the last year, I have been diagnosed with ADHD. Since starting the medication, I can remember things that normally I would put down to me been silly or been dramatic and then just forget about. I am not saying that I have never made a mistake in our friendship but if I do something or say something that causes offence, I always make sure I explain myself and try and rectify the situation.

This weekend just passed it was a year since my dog of 15 years passed. He passed at home and it broke my soul, I lost my best friend. I told myself that I needed to set him free a year after him passing and the idea of doing this felt like I was losing him again. I had arranged with my friend a week ahead of the date for her to come with myself and my daughter to take the ashes to be spread. We had arranged to go at 6 in the evening so that where he was going would be quiet and I would not make anyone passing uncomfortable walking past. She planned to pick my daughter up 45 minutes away from my home everything was arranged. I could plan the day. My friend advised me that she was going on a night out which started at 6 but she was happy to go later in the evening.

My friend picked my daughter up and arrived at my house at around 15:15, she walked in and made a coffee as usual we sat and had a chat at 15:36 she announces that she is meeting with her friend at 4 as he was waiting for her in the pub, I calmly told her to leave enjoy her night and I would get a taxi to take the dog. This broke my heart as she has chosen not to go to this event for 4 years in a row. The event itself started at 19:00 she was going to the pub before the party.

I blocked her on Facebook as I did not want my ADHD to get the better of me and say something out of upset and anger. This person is also my carer as I have chronic pain conditions. I have had to ask her to take some time off work in the 6 week holidays as I knew she was struggling with her mental health and we had gotten to a point where I would tell her I had done something, and she would double check everything. I would ask her to put items in the places in my home that made sense to me, this would not be done so every time she helped would have to look for everything which caused a lot of stress. I would point something out and she regularly expressed that I was been silly for doubting her, in the last 3 years she has broken a washing machine, 2 beds, a hoover and nearly smashed the glass on the washing machine and shredded plastic all over the inside of the machine as when I asked her to put the mop head into something if she was going to wash it and I was told it was not needed. I realised that my son started speaking to me like I was stupid and I realised it was because of the way she was speaking to me in front of them.

2 years ago my friend lost a man from her life he took his own life; she found the body. She was in love with this man, they had an amazingly complicated relationship. When he passed my friend decided to get a puppy. She already had a rottweiler x bullmastiff who is aggressive towards other dogs. I won’t go into the heartbreaking details, but the pup was attacked twice and died. I could not speak to my friend for a while as she showed no remorse but was annoyed that she had been bitten upon returning to her home.

My memory is getting better, I am seeing patterns in her behaviours that have been happening for years, but I have always overlooked as it is just how she is. But at the same time, I understand that since we have reconnected, she is grieving and that is why she is been so cold and controlling. I know I need to replace her as my carer as she cannot provide the support i need but the idea of hurting her by cutting her off and knowing that I would be adding to her pain makes me feel like an awful person. I just cannot seem to find clarity in my brain, but I know that if I try to speak to her, she will gaslight me and cry as she has done in the past.

I am so conflicted any clarity anyone can offer is needed! If you managed to get through all my waffle I hope you get yourself a treat for you are fabulous!",2,1756163869.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

From my first day, it was completely unorganized and clearly nothing like what was presented online. The instructors were late, disrespectful, and plain lazy. There was limited space and equipment for practicing our skills. Then, finally, we got to clinical and I thought maybe I would get to gain experience and confidence through it. Instead, I got my partner and they assigned us our resident, took us to his room, and shut the door behind us with only the knowledge that he liked coffee. No care plan or aide in sight. No knowledge of his conditions or usual behavior. We were literally just thrown to the wolves and got to practice almost nothing.

Caught my wife in a relationship with another guy. I basically told her she could talk to other people because I didn't think she was happy. I just wanted her to be upfront about it. Scroll down for some of the messages I found and for the conclusion.

Tried fixing the format but f it

Some backtory:

We've been together for 9 years and married for 2. We did talk about marriage; it just didn't happen until later due to our situation. I also know I'm not perfect and struggled (sometimes still do) with a porn addiction. I know she didn't like it, but I also did not let it get in between our relationship sexually.

We have some minor/major differences. She wants kids, and I don't (I've told her this from the beginning). I'm a more introverted/antisocial homebody, and she's more extroverted. She goes out every weekend, and I have gone out with her occasionally. We also go out together. I feel like she hasn't really been fulfilled from our relationship, so about 2 to 3 years in, I let her know that she should explore other options to see if she'd be happier with someone else. I just wanted her to be open about it.

She hated when I talked to other women. Including her sister. A lot of times she would get mad at me for the things her sister said, saying I invited or instigated it. Now it's not an issue because I ignore her sister at all costs. I also cut out two female friends that I had from before I knew her. When women would like my posts, she would react strongly. So I deleted my Instagram for that reason. I felt that if I had to remove things from my life to make her happier, I didn't mind (except the porn; I know I'm awful).

Yet, she is currently doing all of these same activities (occasionally porn as well). I know it's not good, but I would occasionally look through her phone, and there would be messages with other guys, and then she would delete them. They didn't really contain anything ""incriminating,"" so I didn't bring it up to her. Recently I also found out she hid her Insta stories from me (I have an account for my dog) and anyone that I know (parents, sister, sister's friends, etc.). I looked through her stories, and she's not posting any inappropriate pictures but definitely showing herself off and obviously getting likes from tons of guys. I have also noticed her deleting DMs from guys.

Our current situation:

I found messages from a guy she met when she was out one night. She told me she went out with a friend who brought a guy she was currently seeing, and he brought one of his friends. When I confronted my wife about the messages, she said they were ""just talking."" She said they only hung out like 3 times, yet the messages show at least 5, maybe 6, and they had also planned to meet other times that didn't work out. I'll include some excerpts from what I found in chronological order (messages that are grouped together occurred on the same day):

her: ""How about we grab some tacos and coffee and head back to yours"" (10:28am)
him: ""I already miss you"" (2:42pm)
him: ""...how good your lips taste""
her: ""I like how yours taste too""

him: ""Drinks and food n make the pool"" (9pm, according to the messages, this appears to be the fourth date at his place.)

her: ""How about I make us breakfast in the am?"" (The messages don't indicate this happened, but she did tell me she made breakfast for him. This appears to be the fifth and final date.)

her: ""I'm getting the sense that we're maybe moving more towards being friends?"" (She told me that this was her basically trying to cut him off)

her: ""I was about to invite you to my friend's bday dinner."" (This date never happened, but it seems like her friends possibly knew about their relationship.)

her: ""Are you awake?"" (1:50am)
her: ""Come get meeee""
him: ""Babe can you come over?""
her: ""omw"" (seems like this date never happened due to poor communication on his part)

him: ""I want you""
him: ""Send addy""
her: ""You're picking me up?! Lol""
him: ""I'm by the * [a mall in town].""
her: ""sounds good""
him: ""Come over. Meet you at my place?""
him: ""...you can come by the * if you want or we can meet later tn""
him: ""I just miss you and I wanted to see you""
her: ""Thank you that is a lot better, what would you like to do?""
(It's unclear whether they met up for a possible sixth date. She deleted her call log with him before I could correlate a time frame for when they transitioned to calls.)

her: ""...i found someone to go with."" (She was supposed to go out with her friends the day before her bday but cancelled. That someone was me:/)

They were texting every day, so I left out a lot of the boring stuff that's present in any emotional relationship. How I did not notice this before was beyond me. She told me that he was ""a little handsy."" She also told me that things didn't go past kissing. She also says she tells interested men that she has a man ""but they're very persistent."" That may be what a lot of the previous messages I was seeing were. Some of them were asking her if they could take her out. Never had reason to suspect anything else, but she obviously gave them her number.

From what the texts show, this relationship had been going on for about a month from the point I found the messages.

Just trying to take it all in and decide what I'm going to do. It confuses me that she still wants to be in this relationship and suggests that we stay together. Will she continue this behavior? Did she do this in the past? I don't think it matters anymore whether the relationship escalated physically; I just want the truth from her. I'm not sure if I'll get it or that I'll believe the answers she's giving me. I know I can't be too upset at the situation because I'm no better, and I basically gave her permission.

I’m looking for some legal advice regarding a contractor situation I’ve had happen to my family. 

We hired a company to help us paint our basement ceiling and walls, as well as install a new closet. They gave us a quote and we paid half up front after signing a contract we all agreed on and that outlined the specific prep work they would do for our space. 

In the middle of the project, after shittily painting the walls and ceiling (destroying our carpet in the process) but before installing the closet, the company told us they weren’t going to do anymore work. They weren’t going to fix the issues we’d identified or install the closet at all. 

While they were working on the project, we noticed several issues that indicated proper prepwork hadn’t been done. These included doing things like prepping a steel beam for painting, prepping the ceiling (there were still cobwebs all over), sanding & filling nail holes, scuff sanding the wall for better paint adhesion, repairing a hole in the wall, and and prepping the metal ductwork for painting. As a result, there are a lot of imperfections and issues that need to be addressed and fixed that will now need to either be done by us or another contractor. 

In addition to the unfinished work on the painting, they also destroyed our carpet, damaged a fridge, got paint on all furniture pieces (treadmill, white couch, coffee table & Storage shelves), painted on marble windowsills when they should have been cleaned and dumped all of their paint water in an organic garden under two fruit tree guilds that we’ve cultivated for years without asking us. They were also incredibly difficult to get ahold of and would constantly string us along with saying they’d call us back, but never did. 

Even worse, they used the wrong paint type when spraying the ceiling that we had to stay in a hotel for 3 days because the fumes were so bad and giving us headaches.

My question is what would you recommend doing? I have gathered quotes for the new work that must be completed because they didn’t finish their end of the contract, and also have quotes for the things they damaged including carpet, furniture, etc. I’m thinking small claims court and then trying to get a lien on their business but not sure what the best strategy will be. They’ve offered to pay for the carpet but that’s it. 

EDIT: A few additional details: their contract did not specifically have a clause about what constitutes ending the contract without competition and our local jurisdiction has a limit of $6k on small claims court claims.",1,1756163722.0,homeowners,0,0.67,False
1n05vg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n05vg2/i_think_i_need_to_end_my_friendship_of_22_years/,I think I need to end my friendship of 22 years,"I need some advice please! I am debating ending a 22-year friendship and I am so heartbroken. For some background in the last year, I have been diagnosed with ADHD. Since starting the medication, I can remember things that normally I would put down to me been silly or been dramatic and then just forget about. I am not saying that I have never made a mistake in our friendship but if I do something or say something that causes offence, I always make sure I explain myself and try and rectify the situation.

This weekend just passed it was a year since my dog of 15 years passed. He passed at home and it broke my soul, I lost my best friend. I told myself that I needed to set him free a year after him passing and the idea of doing this felt like I was losing him again. I had arranged with my friend a week ahead of the date for her to come with myself and my daughter to take the ashes to be spread. We had arranged to go at 6 in the evening so that where he was going would be quiet and I would not make anyone passing uncomfortable walking past. She planned to pick my daughter up 45 minutes away from my home everything was arranged. I could plan the day. My friend advised me that she was going on a night out which started at 6 but she was happy to go later in the evening.

My friend picked my daughter up and arrived at my house at around 15:15, she walked in and made a coffee as usual we sat and had a chat at 15:36 she announces that she is meeting with her friend at 4 as he was waiting for her in the pub, I calmly told her to leave enjoy her night and I would get a taxi to take the dog. This broke my heart as she has chosen not to go to this event for 4 years in a row. The event itself started at 19:00 she was going to the pub before the party.

I blocked her on Facebook as I did not want my ADHD to get the better of me and say something out of upset and anger. This person is also my carer as I have chronic pain conditions. I have had to ask her to take some time off work in the 6 week holidays as I knew she was struggling with her mental health and we had gotten to a point where I would tell her I had done something, and she would double check everything. I would ask her to put items in the places in my home that made sense to me, this would not be done so every time she helped would have to look for everything which caused a lot of stress. I would point something out and she regularly expressed that I was been silly for doubting her, in the last 3 years she has broken a washing machine, 2 beds, a hoover and nearly smashed the glass on the washing machine and shredded plastic all over the inside of the machine as when I asked her to put the mop head into something if she was going to wash it and I was told it was not needed. I realised that my son started speaking to me like I was stupid and I realised it was because of the way she was speaking to me in front of them.

2 years ago my friend lost a man from her life he took his own life; she found the body. She was in love with this man, they had an amazingly complicated relationship. When he passed my friend decided to get a puppy. She already had a rottweiler x bullmastiff who is aggressive towards other dogs. I won’t go into the heartbreaking details, but the pup was attacked twice and died. I could not speak to my friend for a while as she showed no remorse but was annoyed that she had been bitten upon returning to her home.

My memory is getting better, I am seeing patterns in her behaviours that have been happening for years, but I have always overlooked as it is just how she is. But at the same time, I understand that since we have reconnected, she is grieving and that is why she is been so cold and controlling. I know I need to replace her as my carer as she cannot provide the support i need but the idea of hurting her by cutting her off and knowing that I would be adding to her pain makes me feel like an awful person. I just cannot seem to find clarity in my brain, but I know that if I try to speak to her, she will gaslight me and cry as she has done in the past.

I am so conflicted any clarity anyone can offer is needed! If you managed to get through all my waffle I hope you get yourself a treat for you are fabulous!",2,1756163700.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Unless you're a naturally attractive man or have some high income, taking part in hook-up culture can be difficult for us average or below average joes. Often men have to lie about what they want, find themselves in unhealthy environments with high drug/alcohol abuse, have sex with women they don't find attractive, or have some crazy amount of charisma. 

I try my best to put myself out there, mainly bars and clubs, for opportunities for hook ups and casual sex to happen. But something blocks me, I'm not sure what. I have ADHD, and thus I suspect I may be on the spectrum, so social interactions doesn't come natural to me. The thought of having to talk over loud music, play the numbers game and get rejected often, come up with superficial things to talk about. Not of it interests to me. 

Truth be told, I'm barely even into the bar and club scene. Didn't really start drinking until last year and I'm 27 right now. Always an introvert by nature. Sure some nights are fun and I'm making fun memories with my friend, but truth be told if I were to find someone I'd likely limit my outings or stop altogether. 

Then the opposite problem with taking things seriously. Meeting someone at the bookstore or coffee shop, get to know each other deeply, talking about nerdy/intellectual interests, cuddling and emotional sex, overall just deeper interactions sounds beautiful. The destination, however, is also not really in me. To settle down and dedicate yourself to one person sounds miserable to my mind. Have way too many quirks that make a relationship with me difficult.

1n05orp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostalMate/comments/1n05orp/pos/,POS,"Hello PostalMate family! 

I’m the new owner of an independent store that’s been around since 1985. The foundation is strong, but the technology is showing its age. Right now, we’re running on:
	•	An old button register
	•	A Cayan credit card terminal
	•	A punch time clock from the 70s
	•	5 workstations (2 for customer pricing, 1 for overflow package entry, 1 master computer, and a bulk-mailing station still on Windows 7)

On a slow day, we’re still processing 20+ shipper forms, and retail sales (stamps, honey, chocolate, candles, coffee, jams) are not being tracked at all.

I want to modernize and bring everything under a more efficient system. Naturally, I’m looking at POS solutions. Ideally, I’d like PostalMate to be central, but I’m concerned about it slowing down the front counter workflow if it becomes the bottleneck.

For those of you running busy stores with both PostalMate and retail:
	•	Do you rely on PostalMate as your full POS?
	•	Or do you run a separate POS alongside PostalMate for retail/inventory?
	•	What setup has worked best for speed and accuracy?

I’d love to hear how you balance shipping volume with retail and technology. Thanks in advance for sharing your experience!",1,1756163223.0,PostalMate,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Samsung Lions vs. Doosan Bears: A KBO Showdown Where the Odds Are as Clear as a Sunglasses Store in a Solar Eclipse**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of Korean baseball titans: the **Samsung Lions** vs. the **Doosan Bears**. This isn’t just a game—it’s a math problem, a soap opera, and a metaphor for why you should never trust a bear to hold your coffee. Let’s break it down with the precision of a retired math teacher who still resents the time a student asked, “When will we *ever* use this?”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re on a Spreadsheet)

The odds tell a story where **Samsung** is the confident narrator and **Doosan** is the awkward sidekick.

* **Moneyline Odds**: Samsung is priced between **-158 to -162** (decimal: \~1.58–1.62), implying an implied probability of **\~62% to 63%** to win. Doosan? They’re the underdog at **+228 to +240**, translating to **\~39% to 42%**. In baseball terms, Samsung is the “I-just-won-the-lottery” pick; Doosan is the “I-accidentally-ordered-1,000-tacos” gamble.
* **Spreads**: Samsung is favored by **1.5 runs** across all books. If you’re betting the spread, you’re basically saying, “Samsung will win, but not because they’re *good*—because Doosan is *bad*.”
* **Totals**: The over/under sits at **8.0 to 8.5 runs**, with slightly better value on the **under** (odds: \~1.71–1.87). If these teams played in a rainstorm, you’d still bet the under. It’s like expecting a library to stay quiet during a thunderstorm—*unlikely*, but not impossible.

---

### **Team News: Samsung’s “New Kid on the Block” vs. Doosan’s “Here’s That Guy Again”

Let’s digest the latest gossip from the KBO rumor mill:

* **Samsung Lions**: Fresh off a **7-2-1 run in their last 10 games**, they’ve clawed back from the depths of mediocrity like a phoenix… if the phoenix wore a Samsung jacket and had a 75% win rate against NC. Manager Kim Seong-geun is rolling out a **new relief pitcher**, a move that’s either a masterstroke or a Hail Mary depending on whether said pitcher can throw a fastball or a temper tantrum. Recent matchups against Doosan? A **7-1-1 record**. Samsung fans, take notes: This is your team’s way of saying, “We’ve got your number, and we’re keeping it in ou

It worked but gained weight back as soon as she stopped ofc.

She talked a lot about how there was science behind the fasting period and how it was difficult to over eat in such a small window which is why it worked. 

I feel like eating from 3 pm - 7 pm wont be terribly hard with the right mind set and eating nutritious whole foods, and some food for enjoyment. 

I want to start tomorrow by switching to black coffee and just push through until 3. I also went from a moderately physical job to a desk job last year which is mostly when I lost control of my weight.

She has worked at the same store for seven years. She's a part time shift supervisor and a barista champion coffee master.   
In May she informed her managers that she was moving at the beginning of July because she was moving in with me. And would need to transfer to another store in her new city. She was told to talk to store managers in the area and see if any would take her. She did this and found two stores that said they would take her. After telling her manager this they then told her she had to fill out a transfer form, choose three stores within the area, and that the district manager would have to find her a store. Saying that they may not be one of the stores she chooses. Definitely not what she was told the first time.  
Fast forward to the end of July and her manager tell she they can't find her a store but they're still looking. In the beginning of August, they brought in her replacement. But still nothing for her. Last week she complained to her manager that she's driving over an hour each way to work and it's been over three months since she informed them that she needed to transfer.  
Then today her manager tells her they found her a store. But it's farther away than the area she chose, actually closer to her current store, and that it was all closings at a store that's open until 11:30pm.  
This has been her schedule for the past three years and she was looking to not get stuck in that again.  
She told me it's also a store that has a high turnover rate because it's in a bad area with lots of issues. Given all this it's not a store she's interested in going to.   
She feels like she being fucked with.  
Has anyone else ran into this issue?  
Any tips, tricks, or advice?  
She doesn't want to quit because she's taking advantage of the free schooling. But at this point she's fed up and ready to start looking at other options.  
We were each under the impression that a seasoned experienced barista would have no issues transferring stores within a company. Especially due to a life changing event like moving to another city.

Happiness is you standing there, at the door, waiting for me to be close enough to tell me some exciting news you just got. Happiness is when you ask me a question about this strange feeling I am describing, which I don’t know where it comes from, but you are there trying to understand. Happiness is coming home, having a meal with my favorite people, crying over the funniest story of all time. I’ve heard it a million times, but you are just mesmerizing to watch. I love noticing you looking for me to see if I’m listening, and of course, I am. I don’t get tired of you. Happiness is seeing your text every morning, worrying if I already did the same thing I always do, but you know that if I miss it, my mood will change. Happiness is not having this stomach pain when I see your interest in what someone else is doing on my favorite holiday, the one you forgot. When that was the most important thing for me.

Happiness is the sleepover at your house, and listening to you talk about how inconsiderate people are, and telling you that they don’t matter as long as you don’t lose yourself by being at their level. Happiness is going on that trip with you, when the wind was in our hair, you driving the jet ski. You know I was so scared, but I trusted you, you cared for me. Happiness is watching you go out of your way to make people happy. I wish I was a little bit more like you. Happiness is watching you go out after that crappy ex-boyfriend broke into your house. He thought you cheated, you never did. Happiness is us, by each other’s side since teenage years. One more year and we’d say we’re officially going to be friends forever, because we reached that milestone. So exciting. Happiness is not this empty feeling after you wrote me that you don’t want to see me ever again because you heard something in the hallways. You thought I spread the rumor. I never did, but you didn’t believe me.

Happiness is waking up in the morning, excited for the smell of coffee, ready to step outside. Happiness is commuting while listening to a great song, excited to arrive and share some news you just read, or to tell them about this show you just watched, insisting they need to watch it with you. Happiness is going to practice and seeing her, the girl who always makes you laugh. They always tell you how funny you are, but you tell her that. Happiness is getting home, eating mom’s food, and hearing her from the hallway having a little stupid fight with dad. Happiness is seeing his tail crashing on every wall, he can’t stop zooming around when he sees you. He is the most adorable dog you’ve ever seen. You’d love to believe he loves you. Happiness is not feeling that the only living thing that can love you is your dog, the one you voluntarily got for that same reason. Happiness is not going to bed wishing you won’t have to see and feel all these things again. Happiness is not writing down all the things that make you want to vomit inside yourself. You have never vomited through your mouth on purpose, because there is no way to vomit your own mind, the one giving you all this weight of sadness.",3,1756162794.0,ThoughtsYouCanFeel,0,1.0,False
