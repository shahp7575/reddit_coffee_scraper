I know there’s people who work over in Connecticut or NYC or even NJ like myself. I’m sure there’s also plenty of people who live in NYC but reverse commute to Regeneron in Tarrytown.

I’m starting to wish I had a bigger professional network. Yeah, I know plenty of people from work but I’ve never met half of them in person or find that I really connect with them.

It seems like the only option to network is to take a train into NYC on a weekday evening and then it’s just service providers pitching me their AI or law services.

I’m thinking of starting a very casual, low-lift meetup group strictly for scientists, engineers, clinical folks, founders, etc. Thinking post-work beers in Tarrytown or Saturday morning coffee.

No sales pitches. Just actual peers talking shop and connecting.

Like, as if there is no differences has been left.

 People are either accepting someone else's opinion as theirs and making it their own personality or following the trend which has been set on the social media platforms.

So when I was active on Instagram like a few months ago I installed it for some reason, there i stumbled upon one reel. It's about "" i want a guy who's a nerd, chashmish, 6ft height, calm, bookie, coffee lover etc etc"" so I read the comments of that post 😭 and it's filled with i want a guy like that, manifesting a guy like this. I was like bruhh, u all found this post relatable and started manifesting a guy like this, it's just a post and u found it relatable and considered that u want a guy like that, as if you don't have your own standards and choices based on your own personality 🤷🏻

And there was another reel, when it's about ""I'm in my sad girl/boy era"" so that creater said that he/she's suffering from overthinking and overwhelming emotions, so he/started showing some books, aesthetic diaries and was making coffee. U can say that reel was less about mental health and more about overconsumerism. So, if you're overthinking then u need to have those aesthetic cups and diaries to keep it relatable and aesthetic. 😭 Some stupid and gullible people are following this, so now anxiety and stress is less about taking medication and break but more about how much money u can spend to make is aesthetic. Lmao 🤣😂

It's the same with that baddie trend too, like everyone wants a baddie now. Till now I've not gotten an appropriate definition of baddie till date😂.

So, now a days u don't have your own choices, personalities. It's being defined by others or any social media trends. You don't have anything to call your own. Your choices in choosing partner or friends is also being defined by a post on social media. 🤷🏻 You find it relatable and start considering it your own without thinking twice.

Recently I’ve noticed having pain while drinking coffee and I don’t get why that would happen? I don’t know if running to the bathroom after eating/having my coffee is connected to the hernias either.

But at this point, consider me your lab rat. Guided by AI to understand the chemistry of how different brands work, I've realized that despite having the same dose on the label, every manufacturer is different. I'm finally figuring out what I actually respond to.

In the past, I’ve experimented with Alka-Seltzer and coffee filters and clearly that’s not good to do everyday so I am
posting to report another method to make the junk work. Today, I tried a different approach: I dissolved my 20mg NorthStar IR in 32 oz of warm water and stirred until almost all of it was gone. I noticed that NorthStar dissolves into chunks very quickly, whereas my preferred brand, Teva, dissolves much more slowly.

I sipped this mixture over an hour, and for the first time, I can actually feel the medication doing its job. When I take a whole IR tablet at once, I often ""nod off"" to the point where I can't even safely operate a vehicle. This isn't a permanent solution for the quality issues we’re all facing, but it's better than nothing. I also took salmon oil, magnesium glycinate, and iron last night I'm curious if those supplements helped, or if the ""slow injection"" of the dissolved meds is what's preventing the usual instant crash.

I’m waiting at least another hour to eat just to ensure I'm getting maximum absorption from the medication. After that, I’ll take L-theanine, which is my go-to for clearing that ""underwater brain fog"" feeling I consistently get with the NorthStar generic.

This is so frustrating because when I’m on Teva, I don’t feel the need for any of these extra steps or supplements—I don't even need caffeine to stay alert. With NorthStar, I feel like I have to manage the side effects just to get the benefits, but with Teva, the clarity is just there.

I've been at this for 4 years (current streak 40 days, maximum 500). Recently, I decided to take it to the next level. This wasn't just going to be about gaining muscle, learning to swim, or picking up women (external). I wanted to go as deep as possible. For this, I had to acknowledge my disorder: OCD. This affected several areas of my life, but it was most evident in a few:



Food addiction. Yes, I couldn't go two hours without eating. Even so, my physical condition is excellent. But we're back to the same point: physical appearance is external, not internal. My problem was anxiety. That's why I couldn't go without constantly putting something in my mouth. My lie became that if I didn't eat, I would get skinny. False beliefs to feed my lust. This led to digestive problems and inflammation.



Compulsive cracking of my knuckles. Yes, brother. Absolutely every bone in my body. It gave me so much pleasure and escape that it became a daily, constant habit. This deformed some joints and weakened many others. From a very young age.



Caffeine. Oh, brother... The biggest deception of all. They sell it to you as extra energy. But fasting gives you 150 times more energy than coffee. Besides being a stable energy, not just a simple high. This creates addiction and dependence on your coffee to function. A total deception.



I just implemented these three points a week ago: 16 hours of fasting to improve self-control and reduce anxiety. Only three meals a day. No snacking between meals (I'll most likely reduce to two meals soon). Besides improving my entire digestive system, I won't be cracking my bones anymore. Absolute self-control here. I reject immediate pleasure and focus on long-term gains. Goodbye coffee. Goodbye to the biggest deception of all. I'm not going to depend on anything external to function.



With this, I'm tackling my biggest weaknesses. Escaping reality and depending on external pleasures (a coffee, a chocolate bar, or crunching a bone). This is what SR did for me. It made me realize my weaknesses. Thank God!

1put7at,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnaveRPG/comments/1put7at/knave_used_for_modern_investigation_horror/,Knave used for modern investigation horror,"Just an idea I wanted to share. I am yet to playtest it in any way:

I think Knave would be a better fit for modern horror than Call of Cthulhu and similar systems.

I have GMed a campaign of CoC and I don't like how it expects the players to make rolls every time they try to accomplish anything important. If the players don't roll often, they cannot raise their skills and therefore can't advance their characters. But! If you require the PCs to roll to find the clues to a mystery, this depreciates their own ingenuity. OSR mindset handles it better, I think. An example:

In Call of Cthulhu:  
*GM: You step into the living room. There are comfortable couches, a fireplace, and a coffee table with a few open books on it. Make a Spot Hidden roll.*  
*Player: I would like to focus my investigation on the fireplace. I dig in the ash a bit.*  
*GM (knowing the clue they are looking for is, in fact, in the fireplace): Alright, I'll give you a Bonus Die but you still need to roll.*  
Note: yes, it depends partially on the GM. But if the cunning player gets the clue without the roll, he cannot advance his character and is almost punished for his creativity,

In OSR:  
*GM:You step into the living room. There are comfortable couches, a fireplace, and a coffee table with a few open books on it. What do you do?*  
*Player: I would like to investigate the fireplace. I dig in the ash a bit.*  
*GM: When you dig a little bit in the ash, you find a partially burnt note but you can still read some of the message.*  
Note: the same situation but no roll. And since character advancement is based on XP and not successes, it allows the creative players to advance their characters.

That is the main reason why I would try something like that in the future. Some other things from Knave, which I think would work especially well:

* The occupations. A list of modern occupations and the related starting equipment could be made, no change of rules required.
* Inventory. It would really add to the horror if the characters had to carefully plan what they would need before leaving their base or entering the haunted mansion. *Should we put on our bulletproof vests or should we grab extra batteries to our torches?*
* Classless system. While in a fantasy setting it is possible to categorise characters into archetypes like wizard or thief, in a modern setting all people are very similar. There are no wizards who are somehow different from others; everyone can attempt to cast spells from mythos tomes.
* Books of occult knowledge. In Knave, anyone can cast spells as long as they have a spellbook. Similar concept in Lovecraftian horror: if you know the language, you can attempt to read the chant aloud.
* Exploration. No major rule changes but instead of exploring wilderness, you explore cities. Instead of dungeons, you have eerie ruins and mansions of madness.

​The days leading up to the journey were not filled with poetry, but with a relentless, grinding friction. 
It was a chaotic symphony of checklists, half-packed suitcases, and the shrill demand of clocks that refused to slow down. There is a specific kind of fever in the preparation—a frantic energy where you are forced to confront everything you are leaving behind. 
The mind becomes a maze of 'to-do' lists, a 'tension in the wire' that vibrates with the fear of forgetting something vital in the rush to escape.
​Everything felt heavy. The weight of responsibilities, the noise of the city, and the suffocating pressure of finishing tasks that never truly end. 

It was a race against a closing door. By the time we stood in the terminal, the exhaustion was a physical coat we couldn't take off. We were not 'seeking' inspiration yet; we were simply trying to survive the transition.
​I looked at my friend amidst the sea of rushing strangers. 
She was navigating the same storm of last-minute details, her 'unbreakable will' focused on the logistics of the moment. 
There was no space for deep reflection or the 'mirrors of the soul'—only the cold, hard reality of passports, tickets, and the grey light of a terminal at dawn.
​We moved through the crowds like two rocks in a tide of frantic travelers, each of us locked in our own battle to shed the skin of our daily lives. The air was thick with the scent of jet fuel and overpriced coffee, a 'profound silence' existing between us only because we were both too drained to speak.
​It was only when the engines finally roared to life, vibrating through the floorboards and into the marrow of our bones, that the static began to clear. 
As the plane lifted, leaving the grid of the city below, the 'internal fire' of anticipation began to stir, but for now, it was enough just to breathe. The chaos was behind us; the void was ahead.

This is a start..... Just 2 pages

My grandparents are very old and needed in home care, so I shut down my company, loaned out my house to a friend in need, and moved across the country to take care of them until they pass. I am divorced with a 14 year old son who lives with me. I am very nerdy. I am into survival gaming, flight sims, space sims, shooters, dnd, coffee, tolerance, guns (for sport, not so much for killing), anime, science, cinema, politics (not MAGA), and current events. I'm sure there is more that I'm not thinking of right now, but that's a start. I just found out that I like anime so I haven't seen much yet but holy shit, I loved Attack on Titan, Death Note, and Solo Leveling. I love to read also, but I really only read to learn. Right now I'm into learning more about chess. I've been playing chess everyday for about a year and 9 months or so and am trying to become a maser in the next 3 years. My days right now mostly consist of cooking, cleaning, and doing handyman shit around the house for 3-4 hours a day and then hanging out on my pc. I have no IRL friends where I moved to and don't plan on making any since I moved to a very backwards part of this country full off MAGA Christo-fascists and have no intention of mingling with these people so I'll be pretty much online for the foreseeable future.

1put0i6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1put0i6,[REVIEW] Square Mile - Anarquia Pacamara,"This Pacamara was challenging because, at the proportions (1:13-15), the sensory experience was muddled and bypassing made it too watery. Finally, I decided to increase the ratio to 1:17. As a result, the cup cleared up, the complexity appeared, and the “Pink Lemonade” finally showed up.

Man, it's very rewarding to achieve the best cup of a coffee that challenges you, and if you're having a similar problem, opening the ratio before adjusting the grind can save you from a bad cup.  
  
**Coffee:**

* **Variety:** Pacamara
* **Process:** Washed
* **Altitude:** 1.500m
* **Roast:** Light
* **Producer:** Alejandro Valiente
* **Region:** Metapán, El Salvador
* **Notes:** Pink lemonade, grapefruit and juicy

**Recipe:**

* **Dripper:** Hario V60
* **Grind:** 1zpresso K-Ultra (Click 7)
* **Fiter:** Cafec T-90
* **Ratio:** 1:17 **| Water:** 90°C (60 GH / 30 KH)
   * **0:00 | Bloom:** 45g (30s)
   * **0:30 | 1st Pour:** up to 90g (wait until 1:00)
   * **1:00 | 2nd Pour:** Continuous pour up to 255g + Rao Spin.
* **Target:** 2:35.

In the cup: Strawberry, lemon, pepper, slight bitterness, balanced sweetness, and a juiciness that harmonized the notes very well. In addition, the tactile sensation that the “lemon” caused on the sides of the tongue, added to the slightly spicy finish, brought a delicious complexity.

1pusymy,https://www.reddit.com/r/enby/comments/1pusymy/sick_unto_death_of_shaving/,Sick unto death of shaving,"Hi r/enby. I'm a 49 year old AMAB enby who is figuring out what triggers my dysphoria. I only realized I was not a cis male about a year and a half ago, so I'm working through a lot of this. (I also got laid off from my well-paying job at about the same time, and now I work for Ben Affleck's preferred coffee chain, so not a lot of $$ to throw around.)

Anyway, hair seems to be one of my triggers. I'm quite bald and used to buzz all my remaining hair off, but I've been growing it out and even though I'm still bald, the long curly hair I do have makes me very happy. (So does the blue dye. I never dyed my hair before about two months ago, and that's given me such a rush.) Anyhoo...

What doesn't make me happy is my facial hair. It grows in dark, and even when I have just shaved, it's still visible. Shaving also irritates my skin, even using a sensitive skin shave cream, so I really can't do it daily. I can't afford electrolysis (see above, re. work), and it seems like depilatories would be more irritating than the shaving.

My mom has been with my “step” father for almost 20 years now even though they’re not officially married due to some insane Catholic Church beliefs. My brother and I are both in our late 20s, have stable jobs, moved to different states, and come home for the holidays every year. I love my mom. She’s very sweet, loves the holidays, and just looks forward to spending time with us. 

Insert my “step” father. He is a miserable man who drinks almost every night and can snap in an instant. His own kids don’t talk to him anymore. I think my biggest issue is that there’s a constant tension in the house the entire time we are here. I literally can’t take it sometimes and just have to go into another room. He rolls his eyes whenever me or my brother do anything. Today, I walked downstairs in my bare feet and he was genuinely pissed I didn’t have socks on. Or if I decide to make a coffee in the afternoon, the look he gives is pure evil. The best way to describe him is a fake tough guy and fake Christian who’s entire masculinity is defined by his truck. I understand these may seem like small things but he makes me feel so uncomfortable and tense. And I understand it’s now his house, but this is the house I grew up in. I just don’t feel at home here anymore

I’ve thought about hosting Christmas at my apartment but my mom loves hosting. I love my mom but idk how many more years I can do this. This man has caused both me and my brother to start therapy.

On my most recent transfer, I had absolutely zero symptoms, even with the progesterone, so I caved in and tested at 8dpt and it was a stark negative.. not even a faint line. Assumed this was like my first transfer that completely failed to implant, but unlike my first transfer, this one hit me hard. I guess I didn't really expect the first to work, and this one everything looked so perfect from my lining, to the embryo (euploid 5AA), to my uterus, I just thought we'd never get here again. So for it to fail was devastating.

I cried in bed for days, took a THC gummy to help me relax I was crying so much. Had a few glasses of wine, started drinking coffee again, took a hot bath and just said fuck it for a couple of days. I didn't stop taking the PIO or estrogen but got pretty lazy on my timing and stopped taking my baby aspirin and prenatal.

Then my beta came back on 10dpt - it was a 29. Not great, but also not 0. Was NOT expecting that at all. Then a few days later it rose to 144. Thought things were looking up for a second, but now I'm going through a miscarriage on Christmas Eve, and it's SO fucking hard to not blame myself for why this is happening.

i'mi a very private person, been through some emotional trauma so i don't trust people much... i just liked talking to him a lot and i knew he liked sports, and i watch a little so i would always talk to him about basketball, and he liked football so i'd ask how his team is doing...

she still decided to fire me because for a couple minutes i ran out of something, ridiculous.

anyways, when i left he said, ""i'm really sorry mike"" and it felt so sincere.

i got his number from a coworker after i got home, and sent him a text thanking him for being so down to earth and kind, and that i hope he has a good holidays.

a few hours later at night he texted me back and said 'no problem!"" and how he hopes things go well, and how he's very sorry, and that he hopes things go well in the future and that i have a good holiday and new years.

This should be simple. It is not simple. I've been researching options for eight weeks, unable to make a decision because every choice has drawbacks.

Wood tables look warm but show water damage easily. Glass tables are modern but show fingerprints constantly. Marble is beautiful but expensive and heavy. Metal is durable but can look cold. I've created spreadsheets comparing dimensions, weights, prices, and maintenance requirements.

My friends think I'm insane. One suggested I just buy any table and move on with my life. But what if I choose wrong? I'll look at this table every day. It needs to be perfect, or at least as close to perfect as possible given constraints.

I've looked at hundreds of options online, including various styles on online stores like Alibaba. I've visited furniture stores, measured spaces, created scaled floor plans. I've researched optimal coffee table heights relative to sofa seat height. This has become an obsessive research project.

The rational part of my brain knows this level of analysis is excessive for a coffee table. The perfectionist part can't let it go until I'm certain I'm making the optimal choice.

Has anyone else gotten paralyzed by seemingly simple decisions? How do you break through analysis paralysis and just commit to a choice? Is this about the table, or is this about deeper issues with decision-making?",1,1766597112.0,NoOverthinking,0,1.0,False

1pushih,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1pushih/an_eversfield_christmas/,An Eversfield Christmas,"Christmas morning settled softly over the Eversfield house, filling the rooms with a gentle quiet that felt almost fragile. The pale winter light slipped between the blinds and cast long rectangles across the living room floor. It illuminated the stacks of cardboard boxes that still lined the hallway like forgotten luggage from a journey neither of them had quite finished. Some were neatly labelled in Toby’s father’s careful handwriting, while others sat anonymously, their contents a mystery even to their owners.

Toby entered the room with heavy eyes and a slow yawn, his socks whispering against the wood floor. His own room was the one place that attempted a sense of belonging, with a handful of posters and shelves of books. Yet even there, two boxes remained sealed, waiting for the day someone finally believed they could stay in one place.

His father, Thomas, was already awake on the sofa, holding a mug of tea that sent small plumes of steam into the air. A tiny potted pine tree stood bravely on the coffee table, dusted with simple fairy lights that flickered in uneven little bursts.

“Merry Christmas, Toby,” he said with a warm, slightly tentative smile.

Toby dropped onto the sofa beside him and returned the smile. “Merry Christmas.”

A small cluster of gifts sat between them, carefully chosen with portability in mind. Thomas nudged a wrapped package toward his son. Toby unwrapped it slowly, taking care not to tear the paper, and revealed a compact leather notebook with smooth pages that seemed ready to hold anything he might think or observe.

“I know you like to write things down,” Thomas explained. “Notes, ideas, sketches, or whatever it is you keep track of. I thought something sturdy might be useful.”

“It is perfect,” Toby said, and he truly meant it.

He handed over a neatly wrapped box of his own. Thomas opened it to find a new fountain pen lying gently inside. His eyes softened with surprise and something deeper that Toby could not quite name.

“This is very thoughtful,” Thomas said quietly. “Thank you.”

They sat with the glow of the small tree warming the space between them. Outside, the cold air pressed faintly against the windows, a sharper cold than Atlanta usually offered. Toby felt it in his fingertips, a subtle tingling that flickered almost like excitement. The sensation was familiar and unwelcome all at once, and he curled his fingers against his palm to calm the feeling.

Thomas let his eyes linger on him for a moment before asking, “How is camp these days? I have been wondering about it.”

Toby hesitated. His father rarely asked directly about Camp Half-Blood, usually choosing polite curiosity over probing questions. Toby sensed something different today.

“It is fine,” he answered. “Quieter in winter. Fewer people around.”

“I heard from Chiron when he called about your flight arrangements,” Thomas said, his voice careful. “He mentioned that you have been helping in the infirmary quite a lot. It seems you have become something of a medic there.”

Toby blinked at him, caught off guard. “Oh. Yes. I suppose.”

Thomas smiled, genuine and proud. “I think it is wonderful that you have taken an interest in healing. I know your powers lean that way, of course, but still, it takes patience. It takes composure. I am very proud of you.”

Toby lowered his gaze to the notebook in his hands. A small knot formed behind his ribs, a quiet tightening he tried to ignore. He had been thinking about this a lot lately, how everyone at camp seemed to expect him to heal, patch up, restore. It was never said unkindly. It was just assumed, as if that was the entire shape of who he was meant to become.

“That is good to hear,” he murmured, forcing a small smile.

Thomas watched him carefully. There was something in Toby’s tone that did not match the words. A note of reluctance, maybe of fatigue. Thomas did not fully understand it, but he recognised the way Toby’s eyes shifted away, the way he held his breath a little too long.

“Is everything alright?” Thomas asked.

“Yes,” Toby replied too quickly.

The silence that followed stretched gently and thin. Thomas had learned over the years not to push too hard. Toby would speak when he was ready, and not before.

The father nodded slowly, accepting the answer even though he sensed it was incomplete. He reached for his mug again while Toby sat a little straighter, meeting the half-lit room with the quiet focus his cabin at camp often praised him for.

The lights on the tree flickered once more. The heater hummed through the house. And for that fragile moment, surrounded by moving boxes and the scent of winter air slipping under the door, it felt as though they were trying to build a Christmas worth remembering.

After breakfast, Thomas cleared the table and set his laptop on the small dining room counter that overlooked the living space. The screen lit the room with a pale glow as it powered on, casting shifting rectangles of white and blue across the walls. Toby moved a few unpacked boxes aside so they could sit comfortably. He knew the routine by heart. Every Christmas, no matter where they were in the world, they called Dorothy, Toby’s grandmother.

The familiar ring tone chimed once, twice, and then her face appeared, framed by the warm yellow of her London living room. She sat in her favourite armchair with a wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders. A painting of the Thames hung behind her, slightly crooked, because she always insisted she would fix it herself and never quite did.

“There you are,” Dorothy said, leaning in toward the camera as though she could step through it with enough determination. “My boys. I was beginning to think you had abandoned an old woman on Christmas morning. Well, afternoon for me.”

Thomas let out a quiet laugh that seemed to relax him in a way nothing else had that day. “Good morning, Mum. And Merry Christmas.”

Toby leaned forward so his face filled more of the screen. “Merry Christmas, Gran.”

Dorothy pressed a hand to her heart with exaggerated relief. “There is my handsome grandson. You look taller every time I see you. And still no haircut, I see. Athena’s children always did have too much hair.”

Toby flushed with embarrassed amusement. She had no idea how accurate that comment really was, but she enjoyed mythology and spoke about it often, especially when she thought it might make Toby smile. Although he was always confused as to why she mentioned children of Athena, in the classical myths, she didn’t have any. He knew because he had taken the time to check.

She turned her attention back to Thomas. “How is Atlanta treating you? Have you settled in at all?”

Thomas glanced around at the semi-packed room and rubbed the back of his neck. “We are getting there. Slowly.”

Dorothy’s eyebrows lifted in that pointed way that suggested she knew exactly how slowly. “Well, as long as you are both healthy. And together. That is what matters to me.”

Her gaze drifted toward something off-screen, and she reached down to pick up a wrapped parcel. It was covered in gold paper and an extravagant bow that looked like it had been tied three times before she was satisfied with it.

“This is for you, Toby,” she said, shaking the package slightly for effect. “It will arrive late. The post is a dreadful mess here. But consider it a promise rather than a present for now.”

“Thank you,” Toby said, smiling genuinely. Dorothy had a talent for choosing books he never knew he needed. For his 7th birthday, he had been given a copy of the Iliad, followed by the Odyssey for Christmas that year. Both in their native Greek, something Toby had never noticed, given his brain translated written language for him. A good perk of being a child of Athena.

She settled back into her chair and asked, “So tell me about your year. And do not spare the boring bits. I like the boring bits.”

Toby hesitated, thinking of a dozen things he could not say, then chose the safest path. “School was fine. Camp was good. I helped in the infirmary a lot.”

Dorothy clasped her hands together with delight. “A healer in the family. Just imagine. Your grandfather would have adored the idea. He always said there is no calling more noble than easing the suffering of others. He was so proud of your father when he became a doctor.”

Toby felt his cheeks warm again. It was meant as praise, yet the words settled uneasily inside him. Thomas noticed the subtle shift in his expression. Dorothy did not, or perhaps she did but chose not to comment.

She changed the subject with graceful ease. “Now, what are you two doing for Christmas lunch? Please do not tell me you are having takeaway again.”

Thomas straightened a little, pleased to have something positive to report. “I booked us a table at a British restaurant in midtown. I thought it might remind Toby of home.”

Dorothy’s face lit completely. “How lovely. Oh, Toby, enjoy it for me. And order sticky toffee pudding. Do not let your father pretend he does not want any.”

“I heard that,” Thomas said, but he was smiling.

They chatted for a long while, drifting from weather complaints to stories of a neighbour’s unruly dog to Dorothy insisting that London was colder this year than any in recent memory. She spoke with the affectionate energy of someone who adored her family and refused to let distance diminish her enthusiasm.

Eventually, she sighed, softening her voice. “I wish you two would visit one year. It would be nice to have Christmas together in person again.”

Thomas froze for the smallest moment, barely a breath, but Toby saw it. Dorothy saw it too. The air in the room shifted by an inch.

She recovered quickly with a cheerful laugh. “Ah, well, never mind me. Just think about it. Perhaps next year.”

Toby swallowed gently. “I would like that,” he said.

“Then we will make it happen,” Dorothy replied, her tone brightening as if by force of will. “Now, off you go. Enjoy your lunch. And send me photographs of the food.”

Thomas promised he would. They said their goodbyes, and the screen went dark.

The room felt quieter than before. The tree lights flickered again, soft and uncertain.

Thomas closed the laptop with careful hands. Toby watched him, sensing the heaviness behind his father’s composed expression, but neither of them spoke. 

Outside, the cold afternoon waited, crisp and still, unaware of the long shadow the conversation had just cast.

The air outside had grown colder by the time they left the house for their Christmas lunch. The sky hung low and pale, the kind of soft winter light that made the world seem quieter than usual. Their breath fogged faintly as they walked along the pavement. Toby kept his hands in his pockets, partly to keep warm and partly to still the faint tingling that always came with weather like this.

Thomas walked beside him with an easy familiarity, though his posture still carried the faint tension the video call had stirred. They passed rows of suburban houses, some heavily decorated, others understated, all of them looking far more settled than the Eversfield household ever managed to be.

For a while, they walked in comfortable silence. Then Thomas glanced at his son with that thoughtful, hesitant look he often wore when trying to approach a delicate subject.

“You know,” Thomas said, keeping his voice casual, “when your Gran mentioned you working in the infirmary, I noticed something. You seemed uncomfortable.”

Toby’s step faltered almost imperceptibly. “I did not realise it was that obvious.”

“It was obvious enough,” Thomas replied gently. “You froze up a little. I have been a doctor for many years, Toby. I know what it looks like when someone shifts away from a topic because it sits strangely with them.”

Toby looked ahead at the street, avoiding his father’s eyes. “It is not that I dislike helping people.”

“I know that. And you do it well.” Thomas slowed slightly to match Toby’s pace. “But there was something else behind your expression. Something I could not quite read.”

The cold air settled around them, brushing against Toby’s skin in a way that made the magic stir again. He swallowed and considered staying silent, but the memory of the last few days tugged at him. Eventually, he spoke, low and careful.

“I saw Mum at the Winter Solstice,” he said. “She came to camp.”

Thomas stopped walking for a moment, stunned into stillness. Toby paused too, turning back slightly.

“You saw her,” Thomas repeated, his voice softer. “You saw Athena?”

Toby nodded. “She spoke with me for a while.”

They resumed walking, but the air felt different now, as though the conversation had sharpened the space around them.

“I did not know she appeared to you,” Thomas said quietly. “She never visited me after you were born. I always wondered if she preferred to remain distant.”

“She said she had been watching,” Toby explained. “She told me that I have done well at camp. And she told me that I am more than just a healer.”

Thomas absorbed that slowly. “More than just a healer. She used those words?”

“Yes.”

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. Toby felt his father’s thoughts shifting beside him, measured and deliberate. When Thomas finally answered, his tone carried a mix of warmth and melancholy.

“You know, Toby, I am proud that you use your abilities to help people. Anyone would be. But I never believed that was all you could be.”

Toby felt a small knot tighten in his chest. “Sometimes it feels like everyone expects that from me. That healing is my place. Not because I chose it, but because it is convenient.”

“You are more than convenient,” Thomas said firmly. “You are clever. You are capable. And you see the world in ways most people never do. Whatever your mother meant, I imagine she sees that too.”

Toby let the words settle, though he was not sure what to do with them. The faint pulse of ice moved through his fingertips again, and he pressed his hands deeper into his pockets.

Thomas noticed. “There it is again,” he said softly. “The freezing. You always do that when you are carrying something heavy.”

“It is just the cold,” Toby murmured.

“It is never just the cold,” Thomas replied with quiet certainty.

Their eyes met for a moment before Toby looked away again. The street curved ahead toward midtown, where the restaurant waited among twinkling lights and holiday crowds.

For now, the world seemed peaceful.

Quiet.

Almost safe.

But a faint unease slipped through the air, subtle and cold, like the first warning stir of snow on the edge of a storm.

They did not yet know that danger was waiting only a few blocks away.

The restaurant was only a few streets away when the neighbourhood seemed to pause. The winter air, already sharp, grew still in a way that made Toby’s breath catch. He slowed his steps and listened. Something unseen pressed against the edges of his awareness, the way a cold wind sometimes slips under a doorframe.

Thomas noticed the shift immediately. “Toby? What is it?”

Before Toby could answer, movement flickered ahead of them. Three figures stepped out from the narrow gap between two houses. Their bodies were shaped like men, tall and broad, but their heads were those of snarling dogs with yellow eyes that locked instantly onto Toby.

Cynocephali. A hunting pack.

Toby moved in front of his father without thinking. Battle instincts kicked in automatically.

The nearest Cynocephalus lunged with startling speed. Toby raised both hands and released a burst of cold that crystallised the air between them. Frost spread across the creature’s chest, slowing its momentum. Toby ducked beneath its swiping claws and struck upward with a blade of ice that formed instantly in his hand. The creature howled in pain and fell back.

The second Cynocephalus charged from the left. Toby swept his arm downward, and ice spread across the pavement, curling up around its legs and freezing it in place. The creature thrashed and snapped at the air, but the frost held firm.

Toby turned his attention back to the first attacker, who was recovering more quickly than he liked. It lunged again, but Toby was ready this time. He sent a second wave of ice surging forward. It collided with the creature’s chest, freezing it solid. The Cynocephalus cracked apart and dissolved into dust that scattered across the pavement.

Toby exhaled, steadying himself. He still had one trapped and one unaccounted for.

A shadow moved behind him.

Thomas saw it first. “Toby!”

The third Cynocephalus struck before Toby could react. It crashed into Thomas with brutal force, knocking him to the ground. Toby spun toward them, horror tearing through him as he saw blood spreading across his father’s shirt.

Something inside him went cold and razor-sharp.

The attacking Cynocephalus snarled at Toby, baring bloody teeth. Toby lifted his arm, forming a spear of ice that shimmered with deadly clarity. He threw it with every ounce of strength and focus he possessed. The spear sliced through the air and pierced the monster cleanly through the chest. Frost blossomed across its body, and it crumbled into dust.

Only the frozen creature remained.

Toby turned toward it with fury still burning in his eyes. He flicked his fingers sharply. The pillar of ice shattered into shards, taking the trapped Cynocephalus with it.

Dust drifted away on the cold breeze.

The street fell quiet again.

Silence pounded in his ears as adrenaline gave way to the reality of the situation he was now in.

Toby dropped to his knees beside his father. Blood soaked through Thomas’s clothes, and his breath came shallow and uneven. Toby pressed his hands to the wound, panic rising so fiercely it almost choked him.

“Please stay with me,” he whispered.

Toby took one of his hands off the wound, ignoring that it was now stained crimson and placed two fingers to his father’s neck.

There was a pulse, weak and… slowing.

Returning his hand to putting pressure on the wound, Toby looked to his father who had slipped into unconsciousness.

“No, no, you aren’t leaving me Dad.” Toby said as he pressed down harder on the wound. Doing all he could to stem the bleeding, hoping he wouldn’t have to intervene using magic. Not knowing if the magic would even work.

“Mum… please. Hear my prayer, I don’t know if my magic will work on him. I can’t lose him.” Toby said trying to steady his voice and breath against both the rising panic and the cold temperatures.

Soft silver light began to glow beneath Toby’s palms. His healing magic spread through the injury, tracing every torn fibre and fractured bone. Frost curled gently around the edges of the wound as the divine energy wove through Thomas’s body.

Had Athena answered his prayer? Or had Toby been able to refocus himself enough to reach for the divine healing he held? Toby didn’t know. Nor did he care. His gaze was focused on the face of his father, watching to see if the intervention was helping. Begging internally that it was, if Toby couldn’t save him here. His father would be dead before an ambulance was called, let alone before it arrived.

Thomas’s breathing steadied little by little. The bleeding slowed. The gash sealed itself until only a faint line remained on his skin.

When Thomas opened his eyes, he looked at Toby not just with gratitude but with shaken disbelief. He had known his son possessed unusual gifts, but he had never seen their full force laid bare. And he had never come this close to losing him, or being lost himself.

“You are safe,” Toby murmured, though the tremble in his voice betrayed how unsure he felt.

They stayed like that for a moment, surrounded by the settling dust of monsters and the winter air that carried the sting of magic. The world had returned to silence, but nothing felt peaceful anymore. The fragile calm of their Christmas day had cracked open, and something irreversible had slipped through.

The house felt dimmer when they returned, as though the attack had pulled the warmth from the walls and left something hollow behind.

Toby supported his father carefully up the stairs, steadying him whenever his breath caught or his steps faltered. The wound was closed, but healing magic left a lingering weakness, and Thomas moved as if each motion reminded him of how close he had come to slipping away.

Toby guided him into bed and adjusted the pillows until Thomas seemed comfortable enough to rest. The winter light filtered softly through the curtains, turning the room pale and still. One of the unopened boxes in the corner cast a long shadow across the floor. It looked strangely ominous, like a reminder of every hurried departure they had ever made.

Thomas closed his eyes briefly as he settled back against the pillows. “You should be resting too,” he murmured. “That fight… you used a great deal of power.”

“I am fine,” Toby replied, pulling a blanket gently over him. “I want to make sure you are alright.”

Thomas opened his eyes again. There was gratitude in them, but also worry, deep and unsettled.

For a while, they sat in silence. Toby checked Thomas’s pulse. The rhythm was steady but delicate. He placed a hand lightly against his father’s ribs, letting a small spark of healing energy move through his palm. The glow softened the lines of pain in Thomas’s face.

“You always do that,” Thomas said softly, watching him. “Your hands go cold when you are frightened. Even when you were little, it should have been a clue about your powers.”

Toby did not look up. “I was not frightened.”

Thomas gave a faint smile that told Toby he did not believe that for a moment. “You almost lost me.”

The words struck the air gently, but their truth weighed heavily. Toby’s eyes lowered, and he felt that same pressure in his chest from before, tight and squeezing, as though the memory of the attack were still clinging to his ribs.

“I saved you,” Toby whispered. “I am supposed to save people.”

Thomas watched him carefully. “That is not all you are meant to do.”

Toby swallowed. The earlier conversation returned to him, Athena’s words echoing faintly in his memory. I have been watching you. \*You are more than a healer.\*

But tonight, staring at Thomas’s pale face, he could not find comfort in that.

Thomas shifted slightly, wincing at the movement. “We cannot stay here, Toby,” he said in a quiet voice. “Not after what happened. It is not safe. I thought Atlanta would be different. I thought maybe this time…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “I was wrong. We need to move. Somewhere far. Somewhere the monsters will not find us.”

Toby felt the words like a cold wind through the room. He knew this pattern. He had lived it most of his life. A threat appeared, and Thomas uprooted their world in order to outrun it. But this time, something inside Toby resisted, heavy and unmoving.

“Dad,” he said gently. “It will not matter where we go. They will find me anywhere. That is how it works.”

Thomas met his eyes with quiet desperation. “I cannot watch you be hunted. I cannot risk losing you.”

Toby reached out and took his father’s hand with steady fingers. “And I cannot keep you in danger by being here.”

The truth formed slowly on his tongue, shaped by both Athena’s clarity and a child’s ache for safety.

“I think I should go back to camp,” he said. “Not for the winter session. For longer. Maybe for good.”

Thomas stared at him, stunned. “Toby…”

“If I stay away, the monsters will follow me instead of finding you,” Toby continued. “No more moving. No more running. You can stay here. Settle. Have a life that does not get torn apart every few months.”

Thomas’s breath trembled. “You are still a boy.”

“I am a demigod,” Toby answered quietly. “And demigods have to make choices like this.”

Thomas closed his eyes. Toby watched the pain in his father’s expression, the conflict battling behind his eyelids. Pride. Fear. Love. The unbearable knowledge that his son was growing into a world Thomas could not enter.

When Thomas opened his eyes again, they looked damp.

“You saved my life today,” he said. “And now you are trying to give me another one entirely.”

“I just want you to be safe,” Toby replied.

The room fell quiet except for the hum of the heater and the softened crackle of Christmas lights downstairs. Toby squeezed his father’s hand, and Thomas squeezed back, weak but steady.

This was not the Christmas either of them had imagined. But it was the moment they both realised things would never return to the way they had been.

The house had grown still by the time night settled over Atlanta. The lights downstairs had been switched off hours earlier, leaving only the soft glow of the bedside lamp in Thomas’s room. It cast a warm circle of gold across the blankets and the floor, where the shadows of stacked boxes stretched long and faint.

Toby had remained at his father’s side long after the sun had set. He had checked Thomas’ pulse, retreated to refill a glass of water, returned to adjust the blankets, and quietly monitored the shallow rise and fall of his father’s chest. Only when exhaustion had finally pulled too heavily on his eyelids had he allowed himself to sit in the chair beside the bed. Somewhere between one slow breath and the next, he drifted into sleep.

Now he rested there, curled slightly forward, his head tilted against the back of the chair and his hair falling over his brow. His hand still hung loosely near the mattress, as though even in sleep he was not willing to stray far.

Thomas stirred and opened his eyes. The room swam gently before settling into clarity. He saw Toby first, and the sight of him asleep in the chair pulled at something deep in his chest. His son looked younger like this, the determined lines of the day softened away.

A small object lay on the bedside table beside the lamp. It took Thomas a moment to recognise the leather notebook he had given Toby that morning. It was slightly open, the pages fanned just enough to show that someone had already written inside.

Curiosity tugged at him. He reached for it carefully, mindful not to wake Toby. When he opened the notebook, he expected half-finished thoughts or a hastily sketched plan. Instead, he found clear, meticulous handwriting that covered the first several pages.

It was a list of instructions.

Not superficial notes, but detailed guidance. 

How often he should drink water. 

How long he should rest before standing again. 

What signs of internal bleeding to watch for, even though the wound had closed. 

When to take pain medication. 

When to avoid it. 

What symptoms were harmless, and what symptoms meant Toby should be alerted immediately.

And several quiet reassurances written in Toby’s steady, precise hand.

You are safe now.

You will recover fully.

You are not alone.

Thomas swallowed, feeling the words settle heavily in his heart. Toby had written all of this while he had slept, planning and preparing in that way Athena’s children seemed born to do. Toby had always been careful. He had always been thoughtful. But something about this simple act, written with such quiet devotion, struck deeper than anything that had happened earlier in the day.

He traced one line with the tip of his finger. His vision blurred slightly. He blinked it away.

Toby shifted in his sleep and murmured something unintelligible. His brow furrowed briefly, then smoothed as he settled again. Thomas watched him, his chest tightening with an ache older than fear and sharper than pride. The realisation moved through him slowly, like snow falling in a still room.

He had spent years trying to protect Toby by keeping him moving, by staying ahead of danger, by believing he could outpace a world that had been claiming demigod lives long before either of them was born. Today had proven that he could not outrun it. But Toby could face it. Toby had faced it. And Toby had saved him.

The truth pressed into him with a painful clarity. He had to let go. He had to stop holding his son in place out of fear when Toby belonged to a world that would not wait for him to be ready.

The decision did not come easily, but it came honestly.

Thomas reached for the drawer of his bedside table and pulled out his tablet. The screen lit his tired face. His fingers hovered for a moment, trembling slightly, before he opened the flight booking app.

New York.

Departing tomorrow evening.

One ticket.

He hesitated only long enough to look at Toby again. The boy’s breathing was slow and even. The lamplight warmed the side of his face, softening the tiredness there.

Thomas selected the flight.

He confirmed the booking.

His heart ached, but the weight on his shoulders eased in a way it had not in years. Toby would be safer at Camp Half-Blood than he ever could be here. And Thomas, for the first time, would not uproot him or drag him away from the one place he truly belonged.

He closed the tablet quietly and rested it on the nightstand beside the notebook. His hand drifted toward Toby, not to wake him, but to rest gently near his fingers.

“Thank you, son,” he whispered. “I know what I must do now.”

Toby did not stir, though something in his posture softened, as if he had heard the words anyway.

Outside, the night deepened. Inside, father and son remained close in a moment of fragile, quiet peace.

Their world had changed.

Tomorrow would bring its own heartbreak.

But for now, they were together.

""My life will change. I will amount to something.""

It was a stupid slogan. A hollow mantra I had repeated ever since that day.

""I am human. I matter... I...""

Cough! Cough!

I curled inward on the hard dirt floor, clutching my chest as if I could physically hold my failing organs together.

Fifty-four years.

It had been fifty-four years since the Convergence.

Yea… I still remember that day. It was supposed to be my birthday party at work. It was going fine until strange blue screens appeared before eyes announcing the ‘convergence’.

Me, my colleagues, all of humanity were transported to that accursed tutorial. It was supposed to prepare them for integration to the multiverse, the prime continuum. 

It forced us to fight against monsters beyond our wildest dreams.

But most of humanity adapted. The Mana entered their veins, and they evolved. My colleagues... they shone the brightest.

Anthony. Losiel. Ben. Masuka. Desmond. Anne. Isaiah.

They came to be known as the golden generation. Well, except for me.

Just after surviving the Tutorial, the Holy Radiance Church descended from the upper realms and took Desmond, Anne, and Isaiah as chosen disciples. Anthony was handpicked by the Star King of the Zodiac Court. Losiel and Ben were anointed as Saints of Olympus.

And then there was Masuka and me.

For three months, we scraped by in the mud. We were porters, glorified mules carrying loot for hunters half our age. But Masuka didn't stay at the bottom with me.

I remember the damp cave. The smell of goblin blood. Masuka stumbling over a rusted axe half-buried in stone.

It was a Hidden Piece. The weapon recognized him as a descendant of the ‘Giant God’. I watched his muscles swell, his skin turn to iron, his height double in seconds. He crushed a Hobgoblin’s skull with a single hand, laughing with a power I couldn’t comprehend.

The next day, the 'Iron monarch' scouted him.

""Congratulations, Masuka,"" I had said, my voice trembling. I told myself it was pride. It was envy. Pure, corrosive envy.

""I'll come back for you, brother! Wait for me!"" he shouted, his voice booming like thunder as he walked away.

He never came back.

Ten years later, I saw his face on a massive holographic projection floating over the city. He had become the ‘Titan King’, the ruler of a galaxy.

And me?

\[Name: Arthur\]

\[Level: 3\]

I remained Level 3. Not Level 30. Not Level 300. Three.

My stats were locked. My mana channels were calcified. The System that governed the multiverse had looked at my soul and graded it as waste.

But God... I tried. I tried so hard.

Memories of the last half-century flashed before my dying eyes, a montage of humiliation.

I remembered traveling to the moon of Xylos, stowing away in the cargo hold of a freighter, just to find a rumored dungeon that granted EXP to the talentless. I nearly froze to death in the void. When I arrived, the dungeon had already been cleared by a teenager.

I remembered the years I spent in the library of the Arcane Tower, begging for scraps of knowledge. I decided that if I couldn't fight, I would create. I would be an Alchemist. I spent my life savings on herbs. I stirred cauldrons until my hands were blistered and stained yellow by sulfur. Boom. Every mixture failed. ""You possess no affinity for the craft, old man,"" the Guild Master had sneered, kicking me out into the rain. ""Stop wasting our resources.""

I remembered the jungle planet of Verthandi. I was forty years post-convergence then. I had heard rumors of the 'Sun-Heart Fruit,' a treasure that could break genetic locks. I spent five years tracking it. I fought off fever, parasites, and predators with nothing but a rusty spear and my wits.

I found it. Glowing gold in the twilight. I held my salvation in my hands. Then I felt the cold steel slide between my ribs.

""Thanks for the guide work, pops,"" the adventurer I had hired for protection whispered.

He took the fruit. He kicked me into a ravine. I survived that, too. I survived eating moss and drinking muddy water, dragging my broken body back to civilization.

I survived like a cockroach.

Earth prospered. It became a hub of the multiverse. Anthony became the Star King, capable of crushing asteroids with a thought. Losiel became the Saintess of Light, her healing grace worshipped across three universes. They ascended. They married royalty. They conquered dimensions.

And I... I scavenged their leftovers. I cleaned the monster guts off the streets they walked on. I bowed my head to children fifty years younger than me just to get a piece of moldy bread.

""Why...""

Cough!

Blood splattered onto the dirt floor, dark and clotted. My vision blurred. The cold was creeping up my legs, numbing the pain of a lifetime of failure.

""I... really... tried...""

Tears leaked from my wrinkled, sunken eyes.

I didn't want to be a god. I just wanted to be something. I just wanted to matter. But the System treated me like a glitch. A background character in someone else's epic.

Beep.

A sound? A hallucination?

As my heart sputtered its final rhythm, a translucent blue window appeared in the darkness.

\[The organism has died of natural causes.\]

 \[Analyzing Life Trajectory...\] 

\[Achievement Unlocked: 'The One Who Endured the Longest'\]

""Ha..."" A dry rattle escaped my throat. ""Even now... you mock me...""

\[Calculating Karma...\]

\[Karma is overwhelming.\]

\[ Calculating Compensation…..\]

My breath stopped. Fifty-four years of suffering. If I had known it would end like this, I would have charged at that first goblin in the tutorial and let it rip my throat out. I would have saved myself the pain of hope.

I closed my eyes. Darkness took me.

...

""Happy Birthday to you\~ Happy Birthday to you\~""

Clap. Clap. Clap.

The darkness shattered. Not by the roar of a dragon, nor the explosion of a spell. But by the sound of cheap, rhythmic clapping.

The smell hit me first. Not the metallic tang of blood or the rot of the sewers. Pepperoni. Stale coffee. Floor wax.

""Make a wish! Blow out the candles!""

My eyes snapped open. The light was blinding; harsh, humming fluorescent tubes instead of the soft glow of mana stones.

I was standing. My back didn't scream in agony. My knees didn't buckle. My lungs... they took in a deep, clean breath without burning.

In front of me sat a cheap sheet cake from the grocery store. The chocolate frosting was sweating. The candles flickered, the tiny flames dancing.

And around me...

Anthony was laughing, holding a paper cup of lukewarm soda. He looked soft. Weak. No star-armor. No aura of a god. Losiel was checking her phone, looking bored, tapping a manicured nail against her arm. She wasn't the Saintess. She was just an HR rep. Masuka was eyeing the pizza slices, drooling slightly. He wasn't the Titan King. He was just the chunky guy from accounting.

""Wha...?""

I looked down at my hands. They weren't gnarled claws stained with alchemy reagents. They weren't covered in liver spots. They were smooth. Strong. I touched my face. No beard. No scars. No wrinkles deep enough to hide coins in.

""Hey, hurry up and blow them out! The boss is coming back in ten minutes!"" Desmond urged me, grinning. That same Desmond who would abandon humanity for the Church in less than an hour.

I am back. I am back in the office. Fifty-four years ago. Moments before the 'Convergence' began.

Ding!

A sound only I could hear rang out, clear as a bell. A blue window floated above the birthday cake, hovering right in front of Anthony's oblivious face.

\[Hidden Trait Unlocked: 'Regression'\]

 \[The 'Unchosen' has been given a second chance.\]

 \[Current Time until Convergence: 00:00:59\]

I stared at the screen, my hands trembling. Not from fear. Not from weakness.

A laugh bubbled up in my throat. It started low, confused, and then morphed into something jagged and cold. The rage I had swallowed for half a century, the humiliation of bowing to children, the betrayal of the 'Sun-Heart Fruit', the empty promises of the Titan King... it all came rushing back.

I looked at the candles. Then I looked at my colleagues, the future gods who would leave me behind to rot.

""I... I am back,"" I whispered.

The house that we are in, I currently own and bought so I pay for the mortgage + utilities + internet, while she pays for things like groceries + the car lease + gas. 

For context, we both work from home (remote) so we are together for the whole days. But some things are driving me crazy. 

For example, every morning I start at 8:15 so I have an alarm for 7:45 where I wake up and make my self coffee and eat something. We also have a dog, but its her dog that she brought to live with us - I love the dog, but I have always told her I do not want another dog in the future because of all the responsibilities and needs when we have a child of ourself. Anyways, so every morning I let the dog out for bathroom when I go downstairs (something I think she should do) - its the same at night time before going to sleep. She on the otherhand, starts work at 8:30, she puts an alarm for 8:15 and wakes up and scrolls on her phone until another alarm at 8:25. I look at the clock and its 8:29 and I see she is still in bed - EVERY MORNING, I have to go and be that annoying person and ask her why she is in bed still at 8:29 when she should be atleast opening her laptop up downstairs in her office. I'm honestly so tired. Also she recerntly had a job change where I introduced her to one of my old companies (no reference or anything) but I knew what the culture and stuff is like where they are super supportive and colloborative, where in her previous job, it was also remote but customer support so her hours were more strict and she had to get up early but we still had the same issue. I've told her many times, I hate coming to tell her to go to work, and she should just wake up 5 min earlier to do all of this and get ready. Her excuse is ""oh I have slack on my phone"", but with myself worked there many years ago, I know that is not enough, espeically since she is on probation for the first 3 months. 

Other examples include cleaning. I'm always cleaning the house and she has never voluntary cleaned herself without me asking. If I do ask, it will never get done right away and a couple hours later. We have list of chores we need to do every sunday, but her end never gets done unless I ask her to do it and nag her about it. I've even offered to change chores if she thinks mine are easier (they are not). 

Her side of the room, always clothes on the ground. I've asked her to put her jacket away downstais in the closet when we come home, but again she brings it up and puts it on her make up chair in the bedroom. 

Another recent example - last night we went shopping and bough some stuff. She bought a conditioner and socks - left it on the counter top and didnt take it upstairs. Been sitting on the counter still in the kitchen. 

Even last night, we went skating and I told her many times don't forget the gloves. Guess what? She forgets it because she was watching something her sister sent. When we get there she complains that her hands is cold so I gave her my glove and after I got cold, we each got one glove. 

And yes, I've tried to tell her many times and have talks with her calmly. She will be good for a day or two and back to normal times. It's gotten so bad that I have to argue with her every morning and day, and end up calling her lazy and we start arguing. I hate having to call her lazy but its my last attempt to maybe get her going and motivating her. Most of the times she is on tik tok or playing games on her phones. 

Career wise, we are in similar ish industry, but I make 100k while the new job I helped her get sits her at 55k. She always talks about how she will make as much soon as me but with these things I am seeing I can't see it tbh. For both of the jobs she has had, I had to help her apply for them. Yes she prepared for the interviews, but I helped her lots, espeically for the one she got recently. She is finishing up her masters degree as well currently, so when I know she is busy with that I suck it up and do what is needed to not bug her. 

Recently my company has given us return to office mandate, so I will be going to the office soon and no longer will be remote. Idk if this will help me more or less - if I come home and see a big mess, I think it will drive me even more nuts, but in the mornings if I don't see her waking up on time maybe that won't drive me nuts. I really don't know.. 

Today I told her I am tired of always asking her to do stuff and I'm not happy. She said oh so you want to break up with me? She always says that when I tell her something like that. I really don't know what to do, any guidance would be nice please.

1pusefz,https://i.redd.it/3wt0riy4r69g1.jpeg,How to Choose the Best LED Lighting for Your Home,"Every room in your home is unique. That is why each room should have the proper [LED lighting](https://www.maxximastyle.com/) to ensure the utmost comfort. Just like the sun gives us energy, light bulbs work similarly. Some LED light bulbs emit blue light waves, which helps your body produce serotonin. Other LED light bulbs do not emit blue light waves, allowing our brains to produce melatonin. Serotonin allows us to be focused and alert while melatonin makes us drowsy and relaxed. Here is a breakdown of what color LED lighting you should have in each room of your home.

# What color LED lighting should I use in my bedroom?

Most of us like our bedrooms to have a relaxing atmosphere to allow for a proper night’s sleep. Creating a peaceful ambiance in your bedroom requires that you avoid using blue light waves. Avoiding this allows your body to produce the necessary melatonin needed for a night of sleep. The [proper LED lighting](https://www.maxximastyle.com/dimmable-br40-17-watt-led-warm-white-1500-lumens-100-watt-equivalent-mlb-br40200w) brightness suggested would be 1,500 – 4,000 lumens with a color temperature of 2700-3000K.

# What color LED lighting should I use in my living room?

With the living room being a popular place for your family and guests to congregate, you want to ensure it has a relaxing vibe but not drowsy. It is important to have a mix of light sources in the living room so you can adapt to whatever the occasion is. Whether you’re watching a family movie or entertaining guests you can adjust the lights accordingly to ensure the right ambiance. Utilizing [dimmable lights](https://www.maxximastyle.com/electrical/led-dimmer-switches) will allow you to properly adjust the lights for whatever event you’re hosting. For living rooms, the proper LED lighting suggested total brightness is 1,500-3,000 lumens with a color temperature of 2200-3000K.

# What color LED lighting should I use in my kitchen?

Most individuals spend a lot of time in their kitchens. Starting your morning with a cup of coffee and some breakfast means you want lighting that will wake you up. Opposite of your bedroom, here is where you will want blue-emitting LED lights. This will keep you alert while prepping meals. If you also have an area in your kitchen with a table, a dimmable overhead fixture with a warmer color temperature will create a nice atmosphere for dinner guests. In kitchens, you should take advantage of [LED downlights](https://www.maxximastyle.com/recessed-lighting) to achieve proper lighting without needing fancy fixtures. The suggested total brightness is 4,000-8,000 lumens with a color temperature of 2700-5000K.

# What color LED lighting should I use for my bathroom?

In bathrooms, we prefer for the lighting to come from around the mirror as opposed to the ceiling. The LED lighting in bathrooms should be bright so you can make sure you don’t mess up your makeup or miss a spot shaving. Using larger globe style bulbs in your [vanity fixture](https://www.maxximastyle.com/catalogsearch/result/index/?cat=10&q=Vanity+Lights) is a common way to illuminate this space. For bathrooms, we recommend a total brightness of 4,000-8,000 lumens with a color temperature of 3000-5000K.

# What color LED lighting should I use for my home office?

Our [retrofit downlights](https://www.maxximastyle.com/recessed-lighting/led-retrofit-downlights) are a great option for office lighting and come with selectable color settings that range up to 5000K daylight. They clip into your existing ceiling cans and come in a variety of sizes and styles to fit your space.

# What color LED lighting should I use for garages or exteriors?

Similar to a home office, if you have a garage or heavy-duty workspace, using lighting that is bright and provides ample visibility to see what you're working on is ideal. Our linkable [shop lights](https://www.maxximastyle.com/led-light-fixtures/led-shop-lights) or [temporary work lights](https://www.maxximastyle.com/led-light-fixtures/led-work-lights) provide 5000K of daylight, which should help you accomplish any task. If you're looking for perimeter lighting, a nice 3000K warm white temperature, as shown in our popular [wall light](https://www.maxximastyle.com/outdoor-led-lights/led-wall-lights) provides a welcoming ambient appearance to any visitor. When considering perimeter security, 5000K daylight is ideal to easily view any area, and several of our [LED security lights](https://www.maxximastyle.com/outdoor-led-lights/led-security-lights) come with dusk to dawn and motion sensors so you will always be alerted when movement is detected.",1,1766596758.0,u_Maxxima_Lighting,0,1.0,False

Most of my coffee chats and interviews are scheduled at DIFC, and many of the firms I’m targeting are based there. I’m therefore trying to figure out the best accommodation options for a 2–3 month stay.

I’ve been told public transport isn’t always as convenient as London, so I’d really appreciate advice on:
 • Areas to look for short-term accommodation and best platform or site
 • Whether it’s better to stay close to DIFC vs. live away or other city and commute when needed
 • Typical budgets / realistic options (shared apartments, monthly rentals, etc.)

Also, if anyone else is in a similar boat, recently moved, job hunting, or spending a few months in Dubai, please drop a comment. Would be great to connect.

I restarted late November and have been taking it for 5 weeks. I stared at 143 lbs and now at 135 lbs. Prior to Reta, I had lost 60lbs over the past few years, but slowly regained about 15 lbs. My goal is to get back to 120-125lbs.  

I have always had issues with stomach. I have anxiety and sour stomach in the morning, so historically I often skipped breakfast and ate 2 meals per day.  Now on Reta, I have increased reduction in appetite and find myself drinking protein shake with coffee for breakfast, protein bar and apple for lunch, then reasonable dinner that is probably around 500-600 calories (e.g., chicken breast and veggies).  What is different is I used to have a bigger lunch. Currently I am sick for the past week. Went through my entire household. I just feel so fatigued and like I am struggling to kick the virus. Appetite has been even less. 

Looking for feedback on my diet and opinion of others if it is sufficient. Also looking for advice if I should just continue 0.75mg/week for a while. Or should I even go back to 0.5mg? I am not experiencing side effects, but I am concerned it is too effective and I am not motivated or have desire to eat. I have always been sort of intuitive eater and find it really hard to force myself to eat on a schedule if I am not hungry. On the other hand, I worry that my current eating habits/pattern (and calorie intake) is not sufficient. 

Historically when I was losing weight in past without the help of medication, I would average 0.5 lb loss per week and it took me 18 months to lose 60 lbs. So my current weight loss rate seems a bit fast for me. Any advice and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!

\---

White Line. 1

TRINK TRINK TRINK.

The small bronze handbell echoed sharply through the dual central plaza.

“EXTRA! EXTRA! ETHIOPIA SIGNS ACCORD WITH ARABIA!”

Perched atop a stool with folded newspapers by his side, a young man—perhaps thirteen, give or take a year—with lungs that seemed to equal those of ten men, barked headlines and news at any soul who dared cross his gaze. The cold afternoon sun fell upon his shoulders. He wore simple clothes; what stood out was the green cap with ""Escuela Municipal de Cortina: João S. Duarte"" embroidered in white.

“LINE 57 FORK TO ANDINA COMPLETED!”

By this time, he should have been in school. Mateo didn’t judge; the boy must have his reasons for shouting news for hours on end. The frigid autumn winds hissed through the central square. Mateo thanked his past self for grabbing a thicker coat before leaving; this cold could easily knock out Rocky Marciano himself. The plaza was emptier than usual—not that many chose this path anyway, but the typical movement was missing. A few shops were open, a couple walked their two dogs, and an old man tossed breadcrumbs to the grey pigeons. Further ahead, the border guard was already waiting; he was an old acquaintance.

“Mr. Viera,” cordial as always.

In a khaki-green uniform and broad-shouldered, Raúl—a dark-skinned man with a deep voice and angular face—was nonetheless one of the best people one could have as a colleague. A friendly smile broke across his face as he gathered the documents.

“Chilly afternoon, isn't it? Any news, sir?”

“None, only the price of heating, which keeps rising,” Mateo replied, glancing subtly at the surrounding plazas. He had forgotten to touch up before leaving; he tried to push away thoughts of being discovered. “Otherwise, everything is normal.”

Handing back the checked papers, Raúl noted, “All set. You just need to renew them in six days.”

“Thank you for reminding me, but I’m in a bit of a hurry. Have a good day.”

Heading toward the center of the plaza, Raúl tapped Mateo on the back before gripping his shoulder briefly.

“Take care. I’ve never seen the plazas so quiet.”

The change in tone surprised Mateo. For a second, he thought it was about that.

“I’ll... I’ll be more careful, thank you,” he said, turning away slowly.

The green and red tiles of the plaza became increasingly loose the closer he got to the avenue and the border; some even seemed to be losing their color. Finally, the border: a white line that stretched across the entire plaza and avenue, always freshly painted on both sides of the sidewalk. The once-twin cities, almost Siamese, had long since been separated. To the west lay Argentine land; white and blue mansions dominated the horizon of the neo-European plaza. To the east—where he came from—was Nokaria. It wasn't much different, but it was definitive: they were no longer the same, and there was no chance of reconciliation. Crossing the road, he didn't even need to look for cars; they were rare—not to mention the inspection and the toll one would have to pay just to cross what should have been a simple square.

In the center of the lines, in the middle of the avenue, in the neutral zone, sat a café that could very well be the territory of everyone or no one; ""everyone's"" was preferable. On a sign with bulbs that needed replacing yesterday, it read ""Café e Equador."" It was a sanctuary for those crossing from one side to the other—for work, family, or work that wasn't quite legal. It had a yellowish hue; outside, there were large umbrellas—closed for now, as no one would dare sit outside in this cold—and wooden tables. It also had two mailboxes, one for each side of the border.

PLIM PLIM

Cozy as ever, the warm, comforting air enveloped him like a Caribbean summer breeze. There were a few people at the tables. Two men in elegant clothes with full beards: one carried a cane, the other wore thin glasses and held a pen and inkwell, his eyes strangely joyful for someone who looked like a railway aristocrat, now eating what appeared to be a sundae. In the corner near the counter, a man of surprising physique—he looked like a Greek pillar—with Slavic features and a short overcoat. What stood out was that he seemed to have been reading the morning paper, on the same page and paragraph, for five minutes. Strange, but perhaps he was a slow reader. A young couple—who, if they weren't outside a theater, could easily be called the equivalent of Romeo and Juliet.

After hanging his hat and coat on the racks, Mateo walked to the counter and display case with his heavy-soled boots. Melktert; Qumbe; Wine Sagú; Furrundu, among other sweets. Inside stood the waitress, a young woman with brown skin, wearing a light blue dress, a white apron, and high hair held by a red headband with white polka dots.

“Good afternoon, Miss Wmale,” Mateo said, placing five Libers on the ledge. “A cup of coffee, please, and one toasted sandwich.”

“Viera! Good to see you today. Would you like it now or the usual?” she asked, leaning against the counter as she noted the order.

“At the table, but not yet. I’ll call when I’m ready, thank you.”

Mateo entered the bathroom with his briefcase. He placed it on the sink and opened it. Inside were makeup tools—cheap, but they did the job. He took the jar of foundation and the brush. Staring into the mirror, he saw a man with darker patches on his skin. Spots where the sweat from the walk had dissolved the coverage. The man in the reflection ran his hand over his pale cheek. He rubbed. The skin turned darker, revealing the natural tone beneath the mask of powder. Mateo looked away. He splashed water on his face in a hurry.

In the wet mirror: Matheus Vinheda.

His chest tightened. He couldn't be that man. Not here. Never again, not at the crossing, toward the Argentine side, where guards looked for any excuse. Not with Raúl already suspicious—the warning about the quiet plazas had been kind, but it carried weight. He retouched the foundation with quick, almost brusque movements. The brush trembled slightly on the first stroke. Not because there was a real rush—the bathroom was empty, the door locked—but because every second seeing Matheus in the mirror was a second exposed. Vulnerable. Too present. The foundation covered the patches. The tone lightened. His features softened under the uniform layer of powder.

When he finished, he took a deep breath.

Alone again. Or almost.

In the mirror, Mateo Viera stared back. Neutral. Acceptable. Safe enough to cross white lines without hands landing on his shoulder, without voices asking, ""One more document, please.""

He packed the tools into the briefcase. Closed it. Washed his hands—the brush always left residue on his fingers. He looked one last time. Mateo Viera remained. Matheus Vinheda had gone back to where he couldn't be seen.

Finally, he was alone again.

When he opened the door, the windows showed the end of dusk. The white line rose like an untouchable wall. Raúl was no longer to the south of the border; there was a different guard. Mateo knew him, but he wasn't one for much conversation, or even long sentences. A small family of four, appearing indigenous, wanted to enter the café; the guard analyzed their documents—for too long. Mateo walked to his table, and the guard was still there, analyzing.

Then, the small bronze bell of the café tinkled.

Mateo turned his head.

César had just entered, shaking the cold from his shoulders. He was hanging his coat on a rack nearby when his eyes met Mateo’s.

“Mateo!”

He greeted him with restrained enthusiasm—his voice low, but his eyes shining with that energy César carried like a man carrying embers in his pocket: it warmed you, but you knew it could burn if you weren't careful.

“César? You here? How are you?”

César finished hanging his hat and walked to the iron table near the window. Mateo followed, briefcase in hand.

They sat. The iron of the chair was freezing, even through his trousers.

César leaned forward, propping his elbows on the table. He smiled—not the polite smile used with strangers, but the one that said I have news and you’re going to have to listen to me until the end.

“So, you’re really going to São Carlos?”

César nodded, almost laughing.

“Of course I am! New air, new news, new horizons.”

He leaned in further, as if telling a secret.

“Mainly to see our Nokaria with my own eyes, to tell the details to the people. Magnificent, don't you think?”

Mateo didn't answer immediately. He looked out the window—International Avenue stretched out grey and empty under the afternoon cold.

“And the expenses?”

César laughed softly, waving his hand as if shooing a fly.

“They’re paying for everything. They’ve seen my work and want me to document the city. The train ride won’t be long—just a few stops along Route 57.”

Célia approached before Mateo could respond. The red polka-dot headband bound her curly hair firmly, as always. She carried a steaming pot of coffee and two cups on a tray.

“Here you are, Mr. Viera.”

She served Mateo first. He didn't ask for sugar—he preferred it bitter. The scent rose with the steam, strong and earthy.

“For me too, please,” César said, sliding the second cup closer. “Something hot hits the spot today.”

Célia tilted the pot, filled César’s cup, and withdrew with a slight nod. Her footsteps receded toward the counter.

César blew on his coffee, looking at Mateo with that half-smile he always wore when he was about to provoke him.

“Why so much formality, Mateo?”

He lowered his voice, leaning in again.

“We come here almost every day. I doubt she even knows your last name.”

“I had already asked,” Mateo replied, taking a sip. “Besides, plenty of people know.”

César arched an eyebrow.

“Besides your small circle and the border guard? Have you told her yet?”

Mateo set down his cup. The sound of metal against metal echoed low.

“Yet? But I don't see the need for everyone I meet. I only come to talk to you or make notes for the paper. I have nothing else to do here.”

“Makes sense.”

César drank, savoring the heat. Then, with the casual tone of someone just thinking out loud:

“But what if it were for a report? Would you speak then?”

“Of course. Why not?”

“Nothing, just asking.”

César drank more coffee, looked out the window for a moment, then returned his eyes to Mateo. The teasing had passed. Now there was something more serious—expectation, perhaps. Hope.

“But, back to the subject: I’m going to focus on education and integration with the indigenous people. Lately, Nokaria has been making efforts in that direction. Good, right?”

He paused, waiting. Mateo already knew about the “recent” attempts that had apparently been promised since the turn of the century.

“I leave in six days.”

Mateo took another sip. The coffee was already cooling.

“In theory, yes. In practice...”

A pause.

“...I still see problems.”

César sighed. Not out of frustration—more like someone who had expected the answer but hoped it would be different.

“I know you don't like so many... promises. I don't intend to just stay there for the story and work; I just wish you had the same excitement as I do for this trip.” He stopped for a moment, looked at his coffee cup, and turned back to Mateo. “When I return, I promise to bring some things back. How about a batch of their coffee? Maybe some photos too.”

Reluctant about the proposed bargain, Mateo wasn't going to refuse such an offer. “Fine, but don't bring it ground; I prefer it done here. You’re treacherous—you've finally learned how to make others give you what you want. Use it wisely: just news and a little coffee.”

César turned back to his notebook, making a to-do list for São Carlos.

Taking a sip of coffee, Mateo looked out the window.

Outside, International Avenue followed its broken rhythm.

To the left, on the side of Cortina Libre, a Nokarian soldier—Raúl, the same one who had greeted Mateo—marched with a ceremonial and confident step. His khaki uniform contrasted with the red and green bands of his cap.

To the right, in Cortina Alta, an Argentine soldier executed a more rigid, almost apprehensive march under the blue and white flag that seemed heavier in the cold air.

Mateo heard noises from inside the café as he felt a snap in front of him.

“You’re not even listening to me, are you?”

Mateo looked back at him.

“Sorry. What were you saying?”

César shook his head, half-frustrated, half-resigned. He drank the rest of his coffee in silence. He understood Mateo's reasons, but... why not believe at least one more time?

Mateo observed his cousin.

César still believed.

Mateo envied that.

Looking at his moss-green wristwatch—""Heavens! It’s already seven o'clock""—César stood up to go to the door, grabbing his hat and overcoat. “I'll be at the apartment, Mateo. I'll expect you at the station, Mr. Grey.”

“Haven't you packed your bags yet? At this rate, I’ll be there before you even arrive, Pygmy,” Mateo replied, letting out a nasal laugh.

César stepped out into the plaza, now illuminated by yellow lights, and as always, the guards inspected the daily ebb and flow across the white line.

Mateo remained seated, took the last sip of the cold, bitter coffee. What he felt seemed like peace, but also a certain apprehension. It was a business trip, but this time... thoughts of the past resurfaced. The flash, the deafening noise, the screams, the twisting of metal! No, better not.

We share a lot of the same values. We are both looking at the long term. It is going so well. She is everything I could have asked for in a woman: she laughs, loves to have fun, believes in the same things I do and I find her really attractive inside and out.

\----

White Line. 1

​TRINK TRINK TRINK.

The small bronze handbell echoed sharply through the dual central plaza.

“EXTRA! EXTRA! ETHIOPIA SIGNS ACCORD WITH ARABIA!”

Perched atop a stool with folded newspapers by his side, a young man—perhaps thirteen, give or take a year—with lungs that seemed to equal those of ten men, barked headlines and news at any soul who dared cross his gaze. The cold afternoon sun fell upon his shoulders. He wore simple clothes; what stood out was the green cap with ""Escuela Municipal de Cortina: João S. Duarte"" embroidered in white.

“LINE 57 FORK TO ANDINA COMPLETED!”

By this time, he should have been in school. Mateo didn’t judge; the boy must have his reasons for shouting news for hours on end. The frigid autumn winds hissed through the central square. Mateo thanked his past self for grabbing a thicker coat before leaving; this cold could easily knock out Rocky Marciano himself. The plaza was emptier than usual—not that many chose this path anyway, but the typical movement was missing. A few shops were open, a couple walked their two dogs, and an old man tossed breadcrumbs to the grey pigeons. Further ahead, the border guard was already waiting; he was an old acquaintance.

“Mr. Viera,” cordial as always.

In a khaki-green uniform and broad-shouldered, Raúl—a dark-skinned man with a deep voice and angular face—was nonetheless one of the best people one could have as a colleague. A friendly smile broke across his face as he gathered the documents.

“Chilly afternoon, isn't it? Any news, sir?”

“None, only the price of heating, which keeps rising,” Mateo replied, glancing subtly at the surrounding plazas. He had forgotten to touch up before leaving; he tried to push away thoughts of being discovered. “Otherwise, everything is normal.”

Handing back the checked papers, Raúl noted, “All set. You just need to renew them in six days.”

“Thank you for reminding me, but I’m in a bit of a hurry. Have a good day.”

Heading toward the center of the plaza, Raúl tapped Mateo on the back before gripping his shoulder briefly.

“Take care. I’ve never seen the plazas so quiet.”

The change in tone surprised Mateo. For a second, he thought it was about that.

“I’ll... I’ll be more careful, thank you,” he said, turning away slowly.

​The green and red tiles of the plaza became increasingly loose the closer he got to the avenue and the border; some even seemed to be losing their color. Finally, the border: a white line that stretched across the entire plaza and avenue, always freshly painted on both sides of the sidewalk. The once-twin cities, almost Siamese, had long since been separated. To the west lay Argentine land; white and blue mansions dominated the horizon of the neo-European plaza. To the east—where he came from—was Nokaria. It wasn't much different, but it was definitive: they were no longer the same, and there was no chance of reconciliation. Crossing the road, he didn't even need to look for cars; they were rare—not to mention the inspection and the toll one would have to pay just to cross what should have been a simple square.

​In the center of the lines, in the middle of the avenue, in the neutral zone, sat a café that could very well be the territory of everyone or no one; ""everyone's"" was preferable. On a sign with bulbs that needed replacing yesterday, it read ""Café e Equador."" It was a sanctuary for those crossing from one side to the other—for work, family, or work that wasn't quite legal. It had a yellowish hue; outside, there were large umbrellas—closed for now, as no one would dare sit outside in this cold—and wooden tables. It also had two mailboxes, one for each side of the border.

​PLIM PLIM

Cozy as ever, the warm, comforting air enveloped him like a Caribbean summer breeze. There were a few people at the tables. Two men in elegant clothes with full beards: one carried a cane, the other wore thin glasses and held a pen and inkwell, his eyes strangely joyful for someone who looked like a railway aristocrat, now eating what appeared to be a sundae. In the corner near the counter, a man of surprising physique—he looked like a Greek pillar—with Slavic features and a short overcoat. What stood out was that he seemed to have been reading the morning paper, on the same page and paragraph, for five minutes. Strange, but perhaps he was a slow reader. A young couple—who, if they weren't outside a theater, could easily be called the equivalent of Romeo and Juliet.

​After hanging his hat and coat on the racks, Mateo walked to the counter and display case with his heavy-soled boots. Melktert; Qumbe; Wine Sagú; Furrundu, among other sweets. Inside stood the waitress, a young woman with brown skin, wearing a light blue dress, a white apron, and high hair held by a red headband with white polka dots.

“Good afternoon, Miss Wmale,” Mateo said, placing five Libers on the ledge. “A cup of coffee, please, and one toasted sandwich.”

“Viera! Good to see you today. Would you like it now or the usual?” she asked, leaning against the counter as she noted the order.

“At the table, but not yet. I’ll call when I’m ready, thank you.”

​Mateo entered the bathroom with his briefcase. He placed it on the sink and opened it. Inside were makeup tools—cheap, but they did the job. He took the jar of foundation and the brush. Staring into the mirror, he saw a man with darker patches on his skin. Spots where the sweat from the walk had dissolved the coverage. The man in the reflection ran his hand over his pale cheek. He rubbed. The skin turned darker, revealing the natural tone beneath the mask of powder. Mateo looked away. He splashed water on his face in a hurry.

In the wet mirror: Matheus Vinheda.

​His chest tightened. He couldn't be that man. Not here. Never again, not at the crossing, toward the Argentine side, where guards looked for any excuse. Not with Raúl already suspicious—the warning about the quiet plazas had been kind, but it carried weight. He retouched the foundation with quick, almost brusque movements. The brush trembled slightly on the first stroke. Not because there was a real rush—the bathroom was empty, the door locked—but because every second seeing Matheus in the mirror was a second exposed. Vulnerable. Too present. The foundation covered the patches. The tone lightened. His features softened under the uniform layer of powder.

When he finished, he took a deep breath.

Alone again. Or almost.

In the mirror, Mateo Viera stared back. Neutral. Acceptable. Safe enough to cross white lines without hands landing on his shoulder, without voices asking, ""One more document, please.""

He packed the tools into the briefcase. Closed it. Washed his hands—the brush always left residue on his fingers. He looked one last time. Mateo Viera remained. Matheus Vinheda had gone back to where he couldn't be seen.

Finally, he was alone again.

​When he opened the door, the windows showed the end of dusk. The white line rose like an untouchable wall. Raúl was no longer to the south of the border; there was a different guard. Mateo knew him, but he wasn't one for much conversation, or even long sentences. A small family of four, appearing indigenous, wanted to enter the café; the guard analyzed their documents—for too long. Mateo walked to his table, and the guard was still there, analyzing.

Then, the small bronze bell of the café tinkled.

Mateo turned his head.

César had just entered, shaking the cold from his shoulders. He was hanging his coat on a rack nearby when his eyes met Mateo’s.

“Mateo!”

He greeted him with restrained enthusiasm—his voice low, but his eyes shining with that energy César carried like a man carrying embers in his pocket: it warmed you, but you knew it could burn if you weren't careful.

“César? You here? How are you?”

César finished hanging his hat and walked to the iron table near the window. Mateo followed, briefcase in hand.

They sat. The iron of the chair was freezing, even through his trousers.

César leaned forward, propping his elbows on the table. He smiled—not the polite smile used with strangers, but the one that said I have news and you’re going to have to listen to me until the end.

“So, you’re really going to São Carlos?”

César nodded, almost laughing.

“Of course I am! New air, new news, new horizons.”

He leaned in further, as if telling a secret.

“Mainly to see our Nokaria with my own eyes, to tell the details to the people. Magnificent, don't you think?”

Mateo didn't answer immediately. He looked out the window—International Avenue stretched out grey and empty under the afternoon cold.

“And the expenses?”

César laughed softly, waving his hand as if shooing a fly.

“They’re paying for everything. They’ve seen my work and want me to document the city. The train ride won’t be long—just a few stops along Route 57.”

​Célia approached before Mateo could respond. The red polka-dot headband bound her curly hair firmly, as always. She carried a steaming pot of coffee and two cups on a tray.

“Here you are, Mr. Viera.”

She served Mateo first. He didn't ask for sugar—he preferred it bitter. The scent rose with the steam, strong and earthy.

“For me too, please,” César said, sliding the second cup closer. “Something hot hits the spot today.”

Célia tilted the pot, filled César’s cup, and withdrew with a slight nod. Her footsteps receded toward the counter.

César blew on his coffee, looking at Mateo with that half-smile he always wore when he was about to provoke him.

“Why so much formality, Mateo?”

He lowered his voice, leaning in again.

“We come here almost every day. I doubt she even knows your last name.”

“I had already asked,” Mateo replied, taking a sip. “Besides, plenty of people know.”

César arched an eyebrow.

“Besides your small circle and the border guard? Have you told her yet?”

Mateo set down his cup. The sound of metal against metal echoed low.

“Yet? But I don't see the need for everyone I meet. I only come to talk to you or make notes for the paper. I have nothing else to do here.”

“Makes sense.”

César drank, savoring the heat. Then, with the casual tone of someone just thinking out loud:

“But what if it were for a report? Would you speak then?”

“Of course. Why not?”

“Nothing, just asking.”

César drank more coffee, looked out the window for a moment, then returned his eyes to Mateo. The teasing had passed. Now there was something more serious—expectation, perhaps. Hope.

“But, back to the subject: I’m going to focus on education and integration with the indigenous people. Lately, Nokaria has been making efforts in that direction. Good, right?”

He paused, waiting. Mateo already knew about the “recent” attempts that had apparently been promised since the turn of the century.

“I leave in six days.”

Mateo took another sip. The coffee was already cooling.

“In theory, yes. In practice...”

A pause.

“...I still see problems.”

César sighed. Not out of frustration—more like someone who had expected the answer but hoped it would be different.

“I know you don't like so many... promises. I don't intend to just stay there for the story and work; I just wish you had the same excitement as I do for this trip.” He stopped for a moment, looked at his coffee cup, and turned back to Mateo. “When I return, I promise to bring some things back. How about a batch of their coffee? Maybe some photos too.”

Reluctant about the proposed bargain, Mateo wasn't going to refuse such an offer. “Fine, but don't bring it ground; I prefer it done here. You’re treacherous—you've finally learned how to make others give you what you want. Use it wisely: just news and a little coffee.”

1pus06d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1pus06d/gastritis_bad_again/,Gastritis bad again,"I had severe nausea and other symptoms but no pain since end of October. Basically it started a week after taking Aspirin 100mg daily for (just) one week. Skipped the med and it got better, but I still got nauseous from time to time. End of November I took 100mg aspirin again every other day. The nausea became severe again, even when just moving in bed. I went to the doc and from what I described he assumed a gastritis. I got 40mg PPI daily and it got better day by day. I still take it. That’s two weeks ago. On the weekend I tried two cups of coffee with some Christmas sweets - since then the severe nausea is back. Maybe the coffee was too early introduced again. Feel horrible again. Nausea and feeling fatigued. ",1,1766595685.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Wikipedia says that it was assumed by Europeans to cause vomiting because of its use in some Native American tribes' purification rituals, so, unsurprisingly, it never became popular among colonists. What if, instead, it never acquired its historical reputation and was instead promoted as an alternative to tea, the way coffee (supposedly) was during/after the Revolution?

Ingredients

Base

I used digestives but you can use Graham crackers or anything you see fit. The base will be responsible for that nice crunch however due to the nature of tiramisu. A neutral flavoured grain works perfectly here. 

-220g digestives 
-100g unsalted butter 

Savioiardi (Sponge Fingers)

-200g fingers 
- 2tbsp instant brewed coffee 
- 35ml vanilla essence
-150ml boiling water 

I don't drink alcohol or consume it but you can go for a coffee liqueur, if you wish too. 50/55ml would suffice. 

Filling/Batter

- 500g Marscapone
- 80g Granulated Sugar
- 1tbsp Vanilla Extract 
- 300ml Double Cream 

Topping

- 40g Cocoa Powder (To Dust)


Instructions 

- Crush the biscuits to fine crumbs. A food processor would make life a lot easier here. 
- Melt the butter and mix it in the crumbs until you get a wet sand like consistency. 
- Gently pat it into your mould, an 8"" springform is ideal. 
- In another bowl dissolve the coffee in boiling water and add the essence. It's important you let this cool. 
- Take a new bowl and add the mascarpone, granulated sugar, vanilla and whip until smooth. 
- Add the double cream in a separate bowl until soft peaks and fold into the mascarpone mix. 
- Spread half the mix overf the biscuit base and gently pat down until covered. 
- Dip the fingers in the cool coffee mix and add each one into the mascarpone mix, creating another layer. 
- Add the rest of the mix on top and smoothen out. 

My ideal time to let this rest until it forms a perfect cheesecake/tiramisu like consistency is 12 hours. But if you're impatient you can achieve a similar result at 8.

1purzbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Current-Acadia3229/comments/1purzbn/did_you_know_part_1/,Did you know?- Part 1,"Hi, this is Klee Homigo Taitchi from Japan. I am 20 years old. This series called ""Did you know?"" will help you understand and tell you interesting things you didn't know.

This first episode will focus on what we call **Eponymous Laws** or **Eponymous Phenomena**.

The list below covers several different domains of knowledge, but collectively, these are most often referred to as **Eponymous Laws or Eponymous Phenomena.**

An ""**eponym**"" is a person or thing after which something else is named. Because these effects are found across different sciences, they are usually categorized into three main groups:

1. **Cognitive Biases & Heuristics:** Most of the psychological effects (like the Dunning-Kruger Effect or Anchoring) are known as Cognitive Biases. These are predictable ""shortcuts"" or ""glitches"" in human thinking that cause us to deviate from logic or objective reality.
2. **Physical Laws & Principles:** The effects from the science section (like the Doppler Effect or Bernoulli Principle) are Physical Phenomena. These describe consistent, observable interactions in the natural world, often named after the physicist who first mathematically proved them.
3. **Mental Models:** In a broader sense, writers and thinkers (like Charlie Munger or Nassim Taleb) refer to these as Mental Models. A mental model is a ""tool for your mind""—a shorthand way of understanding how the world works so you can make better decisions.

Example: Using the Cobra Effect as a mental model helps a manager realize that a new incentive might actually encourage the wrong behavior.

Why do we name them ""Effects""? Naming a complex pattern an ""Effect"" serves a few purposes:

**Communication**: It’s easier to say ""The Streisand Effect"" than to explain ""the phenomenon where attempting to hide information causes it to be much more widely publicized.""

**Pattern Recognition**: Once you have a name for a behavior, you start seeing it everywhere (which is, ironically, the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon).

**Credibility**: Attaching a name (often a scientist's name) gives the observation a formal place in academic or professional study.

*Here is the list of helpful, common and easy* ***Epoynomus Laws:***

  
🌪️ Chaos & Complexity

1. **Butterfly Effect:** Small initial changes can lead to massive, unpredictable consequences. (Ex: A weather model shifting due to a tiny rounding error).
2. **Ripple Effect:** A single event spreads outward to affect increasingly distant parts of a system. (Ex: A factory closing leading to local shops losing business).
3. **Domino Effect:** A chain reaction where one event sets off a linear series of similar events. (Ex: One bank failing causing a global financial crisis).
4. **Snowball Effect:** A process that starts small but builds momentum and size as it moves. (Ex: A small social media post going viral).
5. **Bullwhip Effect:** Small fluctuations in consumer demand cause large swings in inventory for suppliers. (Ex: A slight increase in bread sales causing a flour mill to overproduce).
6. **Lawn Dart Effect:** Unexpected, catastrophic failure of a system that was thought to be safe. (Ex: A ""fail-safe"" software bug crashing a spacecraft).
7. **Cascading Failure:** One part of a system failing triggers the failure of other parts. (Ex: A power grid blackout).

22. **Anchoring Effect:** Relying too heavily on the first piece of information offered. (Ex: Seeing a $1,000 price tag makes a ""sale"" price of $500 look like a steal).
23. **Decoy Effect:** Adding a third, less attractive option to make another option look better. (Ex: A ""Large"" popcorn for $7 makes the $6.50 ""Medium"" look like a better deal).
24. **Cocktail Party Effect:** The ability to focus on one conversation in a noisy room. (Ex: Hearing your name across a loud party).
25. **Baskerville Effect:** A spike in fatal heart attacks caused by psychological stress. (Ex: Superstitions causing stress on specific calendar dates).

I'll be cutting a lot more from any spending for 2026 to hope to get through that year coming up. As hard as it'll be I'll have to cut tea from the grocery list, I don't usually drink coffee and don't buy it, so that'll be tough without the caffeine. Public transport isn't available around this farmland area so most spending must go into gas. I won't be buying any meats whatsoever as the prices were already going out of my range, I could supplement protein with cheaper peanut butter. I'll be stocking up on rice to use the rice cooker I got in 2020 for as long as the electric bill is still doable (it wasn't some expensive cooker or anything). I'm entirely cutting any remaining sweets I could try to justify to myself buying in the moment because it'd take away from buying something else more important on the grocery list like the bread that goes on the clearance rack. Already wasn't going out to eat so that will continue into 2026. Thankfully I have some leftover patching fabric to sew patches on clothes if needed. Are those shampoo/bodywash all-in-one bottles cheaper in the long run to switch to? I already won't be spending on video games and still no streaming subscriptions, the internet bill is only up for debate if things get tighter since others use it at my apartment too (not the whole building, obviously, those who visit) and it's something to use for work.

A few weeks ago I made a post offering career support, and honestly I was overwhelmed by the response. I had great conversations and it felt genuinely meaningful to give back in a small way.

Because of that, I wanted to extend the offer again — this time specifically for people based in Riyadh.

I work in Finance / Strategy as a Senior Consultant at a top firm, and I’d love to help mid-career professionals (roughly 5–15 years experience) who are looking to transition into strategy, finance, corporate development, or broader management roles.

If you’re:

Feeling stuck in your current role

Trying to pivot from accounting / operations / engineering / audit into strategy or finance

Unsure how to position your experience for consulting, PE, corp dev, FP&A, or leadership roles

Looking for honest, practical guidance rather than generic advice

I’m happy to meet in person over coffee around KAFD. The idea isn’t just a one-off chat — I’d like to properly understand your background, goals, gaps, and then help you step-by-step (CV positioning, role targeting, skill gaps, interview prep, career strategy, etc.).

No fees, no agenda — just paying forward what others once did for me.

If this resonates:

Comment here briefly with your background and what you’re trying to move into, or

DM me directly and we can take it from there.

1purt95,https://i.redd.it/bwpdrwrgm69g1.jpeg,What is he???,"This is our baby boy, Toast. He was a stray found wandering the streets in Yakima, Washington. He is estimated to be about 3 months old. He was 20lbs when we first got him. The people that “rescued” him were a formerly homeless couple in a tiny apartment, the poor puppy reeked of cigarette smoke. I don’t quite know what their sources were but they said he’s part golden retriever and the other part maybe Husky or German Shepherd. They said he had been in several fosters homes already. They gave him to us for free because they wanted him to have a better home. 

He has a vet visit scheduled soon and when we can afford it, I plan on getting a DNA test. 

His fur is smooth but not really fluffy like any of the breeds they mentioned. He has a deep little woof but isn’t super vocal usually unless he’s trying to steal a toy from our 4 year old Heeler. He has typical puppy energy but prefers to eat his food lying down with his head in the bowl. He loves to follow me but as soon as I stop for a moment (like to make coffee) he flops down at my feet. So different than my Heeler who is always standing at attention on all 4’s. He loves to retrieve shoes and pinecones lol. He’s not very snuggly, he definitely prefers to stretch out on the cold floor. He’s a pretty good listener, he typically won’t leave the unfenced front yard when I take him off leash, and when he sees a person across the street, he quietly just sits down on his haunches and watches them curiously- doesn’t bark or try to run up to them.

This morning, while I was making coffee and steaming the milk, the power suddenly went out. It came back on after a couple of seconds, but I had almost finished steaming the milk, so I didn't think much of it. Later, I turned the coffee maker back on to make another coffee, and to my surprise, after five minutes, the machine was still cold, not exceeding 22°C, even though I have the PID set to 93. 

The Out LED wasn't lighting up at all. I tried checking the settings, and everything seems correct, but at some point, the Out LED came on and now it won't turn off, so the coffee machine is heating up uncontrollably.

I can’t even check the settings now because I’m scared the machine overheats and burn or explote due to steam, it goes over 170 C.

Is it the SSR that maybe is burnt?

Hope you can help me!
Thanks!

1puroa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tummytucksurgery/comments/1puroa8/7_dpo_my_experience_for_what_its_worth/,7 DPO - My experience for what it's worth!,"I appreciated reading everyone's recovery experiences before surgery, so I thought I'd share my own experience and the items I used frequently.  I had TT with muscle repair and am nearly 60 years old. My tummy was a wreck from my 3 babies (now adults) and an early, large appendectomy, but I was never overweight or had significant weight loss.

We had to be at the hospital at 5:30 am, which was really awful. Because I couldn't drink 2 hours before arrival, I woke up at 3:30 am and had a cup of coffee, as I knew I would be miserable with caffeine withdrawal without it.  The surgery lasted 2 hours, and I woke up about an hour later in recovery. They had me get up and walk pretty quickly, and the pain was way worse than I expected. It was horrific, and I was nauseous. I made it about 20 feet, and they got me back and put something in my IV tube that killed everything quickly.  That's the only true pain that I have felt, and the only time I was nauseous, and I'm glad it's a sort of fuzzy memory. We drove home, and I went into my recliner and stayed there pretty much for 4 days. I put in an increasing amount of steps walking back and forth around the house and in the backyard - 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 etc. steps.  I forced myself to drink a lot, and ate way more protein than I ever do - bars, broth, yogurt, protein drinks, homemade soup, etc.  I've also been eating frozen yogurt, which is great.  I also took Juven and Miralax every day. By 4 DPO, I could sit for a while at the table and couch, and now at 7 days, I can sit normally most places and get up and down easily.  I went to a movie with the recliners at 6 DPO and have played board games at the dining room table the last few nights, sitting normally.

I never took the narcotics, but took the muscle relaxants and acetaminophen regularly for the first 5 days. I'm now only on muscle relaxants and am stretching them out, so I'm taking them twice a day.  The only real discomfort has come from the binder, the drain holes, the bruising on the hips, my back from hunching over (that was the worst), and anytime I accidentally engage the abs. Laughing is still not good, and the first time I went #2 I thought I was going to split in half and almost cried in pain (but now all fine). I was totally exhausted most of the time and just generally uncomfortable and felt like I'd destroyed my body, but not really in pain. I did a few work emails the first few days after surgery and one 2-hour Zoom call with staff at 5 DPO. I could easily work remotely today at 7 DPO, but I have taken vacation days this week, so I won't be working for another 5 days.

I had an existential crisis on day 5DPO when I looked at myself and saw my horrible, swollen body, but felt much better after going to my after-care visit, and the surgeon, PA, and nurse were all so positive about how great they thought it looked. It seriously changed my viewpoint entirely. They also removed a drain and told me I didn't need to wear the binder anymore, which makes me feel so much better. So I've made significant progress between 5DPO and 7DPO.  I still am not all the way straight and can't move fast, but am definitely feeling on the mend.

What I did to prepare that helped included being in good shape with strong leg muscles (the squats made it so I could get up and down pretty easily), and I made/bought a lot of high-protein/low-sodium food that was ready to go.  I cooked a lot, so I have more than enough low-sodium meals in the fridge to last. I also saved up mindless TV shows and binge-watched for 4-5 days while napping on and off.  And, since it's around Christmas, I also completed all my Christmas preparations early (including frozen meals, stockings, and wrapping all presents), so I was totally prepared with everything well in advance.  This actually has been great, as I can just relax during the holidays.

What I had that was essential for me.

\*Automatic lift recliner.  I bought a really nice, large automatic recliner for $75 on Facebook Marketplace, and I absolutely love this thing. The first few days, it gave me some degree of independence as it lifted me up so I could get up and down by myself. It's also really comfortable and large. I spent the first 4 days in it all day aside from walks, and am still sleeping in it at night and napping in it.  I looked it up the other day, and I somehow got a $2,000 recliner for $75! The brand is Golden.

\*Toilet riser.  This also was a must. I could go to the bathroom by myself and pull myself up immediately after surgery using my arms and the door handle. I don't need it anymore, but the first 4-5 days the combination of recliner and toilet riser let me get up and and go to the bathroom over and over by myself.

\*""Cute"" surgery shirt with drain holders. I bought a cheap surgery shirt with drain holders off of Amazon that I have been wearing every day. I liked being able to stuff the drains in the holders without wearing a lanyard.

\*Airplane sleep pillow.  I didn't know I needed this, but the airplane pillow that I had was essential for resting in the recliner. We dug that out on the first day. Regular pillows didn't work well, but the sleep pillow made everything significantly more comfortable. I also use that as a pillow when I'm eating to put the plate on!

\*Fuzzy PJ pants. I bought myself 3 extremely comfortable, loose, fuzzy PJ pants with pockets that I am wearing all the time.  I am so glad I bought these!

\*Cheap grabber. I bought a $10 grabber off of Amazon, and I use this all the time for picking things off the floor. I'm surprised at how well it works.  I am sure I will use this when I actually can bend, too. I can pick up my phone off the floor, my airplane pillow, really anything!

\*Compression socks. I bought some night socks that I am wearing all the time.

\*Amazing husband. My husband was so great in taking care of me.  He took care of all of my medicines, woke up in the middle of the night to check on me, and has given me compliments over and over.

Not so essential. The Wedge Pillows. I bought a set of wedge pillows, thinking I would use them sitting on the couch. I could never get comfortable with them. I did end up using just one of them each night to prop up my legs on the recliner, but the rest are essentially a waste.  I would have been fine with just a regular pillow under my legs, but since I bought the set, I figured I'd better use at least one piece of it.

What I didn't use at all?  The Walker. I bought a cheap one from Amazon and have never used it. I've been able to walk fine without it and never was as hunched as that walker would have made me.  I'm going to donate it to a senior center near me.

So, I know I'm just one week in, but hope this might help someone.",11,1766594804.0,tummytucksurgery,10,1.0,False

My partner and I officer mckinley were in the same squad car when we had gotten the call from dispatch of what sounds like a possible domestic but mainly just a noise complaint. We arrived at the address. It was a dead end road about a half mile back in the woods from the main road heading back to town, “how do you suppose there was a noise complaint back here there's like three different houses and that's it” mckinley said a bit annoyed. But as we pulled up it was almost like a cul de sac. The houses were spaced about twenty yards apart, with no lights on to the one on the left and the other two houses had two couples outside, the first couple the garrisons about 60 to 70 years old and the fairbanks a much younger couple. “ How is Jacob doing you guys never said anything yet I have to know I need to tell his wife some-”, “we can tell you when we know more please continue Mahoney” “right, sorry”.  So anyways we pulled up and the man mike garrison met us first, “ thank you for coming my wife and I have been up for the last two hours”  it seemed eerie like quiet a loud quiet. “Dont worry sir we’ll handle it officer mckinley and I will check it out”. I turned from them and McKinley was just standing there like he was fixated on the house. I couldn't tell but he seemed like he was a little shaky, but I put my hands on my belt and walked next to him. “You good”, he shook his head at me, remaining silent. I paused for a moment and we walked up to the house I was leading and  he was behind me. The house seemed kinda old white paint, wood siding, and a beautiful ornate door. There was a wrap-around porch with a few steps up to it and before I was able to knock on the door we heard what sounded like a low thud and then two more in the second story above the door. Mckinley pushed past me and proceeded to pound on the door “police department open up” i always forgot how he was so young but his voice was so old like an old cowboy or retired drill sergeant. He pounded again even louder and still nothing, I keyed my radio “dispatch this is Mahoney we aren't getting a response at the noise complaint can you give us a warrant no one's answering and we have a possible domestic and we have no probable cause”. After a few minutes of talking to dispatch, BANG! What sounded like a gunshot I pulled my firearm and flashlight. McKinley kicked the door in with his heel. I entered it was extremely dark alls i could see was the ray from my light that painted the objects in its beam a living room to the left a dining room and kitchen to the right I faced a set of stairs and a hallway that goes passed the stairs i could see a door at the end of the hallway with a window into what could be the back yard and woods. I pointed my light to the right into the living room after clearing the hallway and McKinley looked towards the kitchen and dining room. I slowly walked to the living room and Mckinley towards the dining room into the kitchen. The living room was bare, a couch and chair around a coffee table facing a TV. I walked into the living room more. What was weird though was  I couldn't see a single picture on the wall like don't most people have pictures in their living room, McKinley shouted to me before I could head deeper. “Harry get over here, what the fuck” I paced to him backing away from the livingroom, “what is it ?” As I made my way to the kitchen I could see what looked like a big blob but stoney, the kitchen was ripped apart with nothing but a few cabinets and a fridge with no oven. “What the hell is that thing ?” “I dont know but were getting the fuck out of here,I dont trust this thing and im not fucking with it “ it looked like a stone glyph round with a point from the center and whatever it was made of was a dark greenish grey but it was smooth to like a crystal. “Harry I was just told Jacob didn't make it, he lost too much blood and his arm couldn't be found. What the hell did you two do.” “what? they said he could make it they should've had enough time” “sorry but he lost to much blood and his arm is gone damnit get to it and tell me what the fuck exactly happened”.

Thanks to everyone who filled out the R&D form and contributed here. If you're still tasting, please take your time.

EXP012 will be a white honey from Worka Chelchele, Gedeo, Ethiopia. The varietals are Kurume, Dega, and Wolisho (Ethiopian landrace varietals) grown around 2000masl. We chose this one because I suspect many of you haven't had a white honey processed coffee (I'm open to being wrong) and the R&D responses told us that you like fruit-forward coffees like blueberry, but that you're also enjoying florals and acidity. EXP012 delivers these.

We paid about $10/lb for the green which translates to 310g or 11oz for subscribers ($20 subscription). I'll email out the first invitation to subscribers Jan 1st and we'll be on our way.

We still have Jairo Arcila's passionfruit, the gingerbread from Juan Ramon, and a little of Edwin's raspberry co-ferment left. We'll be roasting those by the batch throughout January.

Our cafe / education center will open Jan 15th at 1806 W Cuyler Ave in Chicago. If you're around, join us for tastings and cuppings.

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions,

1purj79,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1purj79/main_hi_kyun/,Main hi kyun?,"19 F here. I need to rant because this has been sitting in my head for months and I am tired of carrying it quietly.

A few months ago, I was traveling by metro when a guy struck up a conversation. It felt normal and easy. We realised our colleges are nearby, talked for a bit, and he asked for my number. I did not overthink it. We started talking regularly and he asked me out. First date was coffee. Second was Chowpatty, just walking and talking by the sea. Third was go karting and then long conversations after. Nothing dramatic. Just two people getting to know each other.

I was nervous the entire time because I had never dated before. This would have been my first relationship if it became official. I do not do situationships and I do not entertain people for timepass. If I show up, it is because I mean it. On the third date, there was a moment where he leaned in really close. I thought he was going to kiss me. Then he stopped, pulled back, and said we should meet again sometime. I went home confused but still hopeful, thinking maybe he wanted to take things slow.

The very next day, he sent a text calling it off. He said we are not a good match and we should not see each other anymore. No conversation, no explanation. Just that. I replied calmly and asked for clarity. I even called a few times. He did not respond. He ghosted me completely.

A few days later, I saw him near his college, which is close to mine. I waved and said hi. He saw me clearly, gave a kind of annoyed, almost angry look, and then ignored me and walked away like I did not exist. That moment hurt more than the text.

What I do not understand is the logic. If this is what he wanted, why not after the first date. Why go till three. Why plan things, say meet again, get that close, if he had already decided he was done. I know no one owes me a relationship. I know people can change their minds. But basic respect would have been nice.

And honestly, I keep thinking bhagwaan kis janam ka badla le rahe hain mujhse. Main genuinely sabse achha behave karti hoon. Unnecessarily rude nahi hoti. Studies pe focus karti hoon, apna kaam karti hoon. Phir ye dardnaak haadse mere saath hi kyun hote hain. Jab koi khud aata hai aur phir aise chala jaata hai jaise kuch tha hi nahi.

Maybe this should not hurt as much as it does. It was only a few dates. But when you are 19 and it would have been your first relationship, it stays with you. Not because you lost him, but because you lost the belief that something simple and normal could happen without becoming confusing or hurtful.

That is it. Just a rant. I will move on. I just needed to say it somewhere instead of pretending I am unaffected all the time.

Other religions will ban certain things outright as it may lead to you committing sin-> may being a keyword

But catholicism only prohibits exact sin itself nothing else(that even a tiny doing of this act is in a way morally wrong)

All of the following things are mortal sins in excess and addiction

Example:

Alcohol (Drunkedness is a sin,but if you can control and drink moderately then its fine)

Smoking( Only in Excess/addiction)

Drugs:Only when it alters mind and free will.( Cocaine/Heroin ) all are essentially prohibited because it immediately alters your state of mind.  FYI ( Caffeine/Coffee is a drug).

Gambling( Dont bet more than you can afford to lose, dont be addicted, dont be irresponsible regarding it, dont cheat)

I could go on forever,

This list at first glance defnitely makes it seem like the church is allowing sin when in actuality it shows how true the church message is of free will and human redemption

None of these things are sin in and of itself. To make putting down 1 usd on a coin toss a sin makes it seem like not a single human would subsequently be able to control themselves from putting their life savings on the next toss.

Yes there may be people that cant stick to it.But the keyword is -may-. To ban it alltogether makes it seem like there is a zero percent chance of every devoted who indulged in it to have self control which definitely counter acts free will that our lord has granted us.

if you actually follow church rules regarding this matter, you would lead a moral life just like any devoted.

please correct me if for anything i said so far is in anyway incorrect

I moved into a strictly in-office job recently and want to make the K6 my work grinder. I mostly drink light roast naturals or honeys, with a Nordic style washed coffee thrown in about once per month. I only drink pourover. 

I would like to get a tiny bit more flavor separation but am honestly don’t mind an elegant blending. ZP6 is out likely due to my preference for naturals and the fact that I want to retain some body and am not chasing tea-like brews.

I’m leaning towards a K-Ultra as it ticks most of my boxes. With this in mind, has anybody else here made that same upgrade and found it to be worth it and a noticeable improvement? 

Alternatively, I’m hearing great things about the Mavo grinder. Anybody had experience with this or any other grinder they think is a good K6 upgrade that doesn’t go too far into that light body category?

Anyway, I can’t afford surgery and will not have health insurance starting Jan 1, nor am I interested in going under the knife or doing anything that would eliminate the opportunity to have a successful pregnancy later in life, so I’m turning to a natural, holistic approach that includes physical lifestyle changes and spiritual and emotional work. Here’s the plan: 

1, Cleanse and detox: fast 7 days only spring water, get rid of all chemical self care and cleaning products, all processed foods, synthetic clothing, etc  

2, 6 month trauma release holistic healing program: with a hypnotherapist & meditation coach I met through a friend; practice reducing stress

3, after fast diet: organic, natural, whole, and alkaline foods diet  100% plant based. daily acv & black molasses, matcha, and raspberry leaf tea; and supplements including DHA, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, Vit D, Vit E, fiber, Vit C, milk thistle/NAC, and iodine.

4, no coffee, meat, dairy, refined sugar, processed Food, fast food, convenience foods, etc  

5, lots of faith, prayer, patience, love and kindness to my self & my body

1pur7p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1pur7p9/daily_reading/,Daily Reading,"Weight-loss pills that harness the same mechanism as the [wildly popular drugs Wegovy and Ozempic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-antiobesity-drugs-help-people-shed-dozens-of-pounds-but-they-must-be-taken-for-a-lifetime/) are coming to the U.S.

On Monday Novo Nordisk announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [approved](https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=916473) its oral glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) medication for weight loss and obesity in adults.

It’s a milestone for the industry, which has [struggled to make effective pill versions of the weight-loss injections](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-are-hard-to-make-into-pills/) for years. Most people are more comfortable taking a pill than regularly injecting themselves, says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto, who previously consulted for Novo Nordisk. “It’s just good to have more options for people,” he says. At the same time, the pills could greatly [improve access to the medication](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-insurance-cover-wegovy-ozempic-and-other-new-weight-loss-drugs/) by lowering costs—the injections can cost hundreds of dollars per month out of pocket.

“Pills are also easier to transport and produce,” says Rozalina McCoy, an endocrinologist and internist at the University of Maryland, adding that she hopes the new FDA approval will increase access to the drugs.

Prior to that approval, Novo Nordisk, which also makes the injectable semaglutide drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, had seen promising results from its trials of the weight-loss pill, which will also be sold under the brand name Wegovy. In the company’s latest phase 3 clinical trial, the highest dose of the pill resulted in [a 16.6 percent weight loss at 64 weeks](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2500969) compared with a 2.7 percent loss among those who took a placebo. For comparison, trials of 2.4 milligrams of Wegovy injections showed [up to 17.4 percent weight reduction](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10092086/). (The injection and pill were not compared in a head-to-head trial.)

GLP-1 drugs have transformed the weight-loss industry and revolutionized [the treatment of metabolic disease](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-the-secret-behind-ozempics-sweeping-health-benefits/). But until now, they have largely been available in the U.S. only as injections. Novo Nordisk’s pill for type 2 diabetes, Rybelsus, was approved by the FDA in 2019. But oral versions of these drugs haven’t taken off in the same way as the injectables despite [even early data](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01185-6/abstract?mod=article_inline) showing weight loss and health benefits to be relatively comparable.

The Wegovy pill, taken once a day, works similarly to the weekly injections—[mimicking the activity of a gut hormone](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ozempic-quiets-food-noise-in-the-brain-but-how/) that slows down the speed at which people’s stomach empties and that makes them feel fuller. People who take the pills tend to eat less overall. The side effects are pretty similar to those of injections of the drug, and they can include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

The pills must also be taken on an empty stomach to work effectively.

“Nothing else can be taken by mouth for at least 30 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed into the bloodstream,” says John Buse, an endocrinologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is a consultant and investigator for Novo Nordisk. “If patients take the medication with other medications, food or even more water or coffee, the effectiveness is dramatically reduced.”

The pill will be available in U.S. pharmacies and select telehealth providers in early January, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told *Scientific American.* The starting dose of 1.5 mg is anticipated to cost $149 per month out of pocket but could be lower, depending on a person’s insurance.

Importantly, Novo Nordisk’s latest clinical trial success was based on the maximum daily dose of 25 mg, McCoy says. Unlike the injectables, which enter the bloodstream directly, the pills are broken down in the stomach, which means “the oral doses have to be much, much higher” than the Wegovy injections, which cap at 2.4 mg, McCoy explains.

“I expect that the effective doses of oral Wegovy will be much more expensive than the advertised $149, unfortunately. But I would love to see this medication be more affordable,” she says.

A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk told *Scientific American* that prices for higher doses will be shared in the new year. “We believe this is the most affordable self-pay price to date for a GLP-1 for weight loss,” the spokesperson said.

Other companies are working on their own weight-loss pills: Eli Lilly, which makes Zepbound, is developing a GLP-1 pill, orforglipron, for weight loss and type 2 diabetes, with [FDA approval anticipated for March 2026.](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eli-lilly-expects-us-fda-approval-oral-obesity-drug-march-2026-2025-11-06/) More pill options—combined with [other effective versions of these drugs](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mounjaro-and-ozempic-arent-the-same-heres-how-weight-loss-drugs-compare/) in the pipeline—will open up the market and hopefully drive prices down, Drucker says.

“I think we’re going to go in the next like 12 to 18 months from these two main \[injection\] options from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to half a dozen options in this class of medicines,” Drucker says. “That’s only going to be good for people. They’ll have more choice.”",0,1766593567.0,CATiim,0,0.5,False

The rooster crowed at dawn. As the first light broke, Kim Jeok-woo saw a shadow outside his door. When he opened it, he found the girl who had fainted the previous night.“You’re the community aunt’s daughter. I remember your name was…” Kim scratched his head, unable to recall it for the moment.“Yayoi…” she said softly, smiling with gentle warmth.“Right, you’re Yayoi. About your mother — I couldn’t save her. I’m sorry.”“Don’t blame yourself. That was her fate…” She glanced past him into the room and added, “Do you plan to make a girl stand in the hallway to talk?”“Oh — sorry, come in.” Kim gave an awkward laugh.﻿

Once Yayoi sat down, silence filled the air between them. As they stared at each other, Kim suddenly remembered something, walked to the cupboard, and took out some brown powder, mixing it with warm water in a coffee cup.“Mr. Kim, you seem uneasy when facing women.”

After saying that, Yayoi took a small sip of the hot chocolate from the [table.Kim](http://table.Kim) nodded clumsily, forcing a wry smile, remembering how Sophia used to mock him the same way.“Sigh… this too is fate’s little joke on you,” Yayoi said softly.“I don’t believe in invisible things like fate.” Kim crossed his arms, expression firm.“Oh? Why?” Yayoi asked, intrigued.“The Kim family never bows to fate. Defying it is our rule. My grandfather once led troops through the White Mountains…” He stopped mid-sentence, realizing something upon seeing her face. After draining his cup of chocolate, he continued, “Grandfather said no matter how harsh the world, we must push through. That’s fate — but also our blood’s responsibility.”“I knew I wasn’t mistaken about you. You’re different from the people of Fog City. I’m mixed-blood too, but I was born and raised here. Since childhood, we’ve been taught to obey — to study, graduate, find a good job, get a driver’s license, join a casino if needed, marry when the time comes. My peers only talk about restaurants or where to buy nice clothes. Their goal is a peaceful life. No one asks why. Even if someone does, others just dismiss it with that old saying: ‘Existence is rational.’”

She paused before continuing.“My mother always said: how much you eat, how much you earn — these are predestined. In short, life and death are fate, wealth and honor come from heaven. But you’re different. You’ve led the community, gathered supplies… The clock of destiny has long stopped ticking, and you are our savior.”

By noon, the warm sunlight bathed the fog-shrouded streets. Kim Jeok-woo and Sophia drove their truck toward the Base.“Savior, huh? If I were a savior, why did Wei leave?” Kim muttered, unable to understand.

Sophia, ever curious, gazed around like a child, exclaiming at every little thing. Her heightened excitement didn’t catch Kim’s attention.

At the end of the road stood a large, rusty green iron gate, marked with the white-painted words: “Military Restricted Zone — No Entry.” The guard booth beside it was empty, though a faint red light blinked inside.After confirming the area was safe, Kim approached the red light and pressed a button. “It’s me, Kim Jeok-woo. I’ve brought supplies.”“Good work, soldier Kim,” the red light replied before cutting off.

Moments later, running footsteps approached from behind the gate. A man and woman in T-shirts and sweatpants opened it — both carried machetes on their belts.“Father Phano is expecting you,” said the female guard, while the male went to unload the truck.

Then, countless golden particles swirled through the air, gathering before them and forming Sophia’s figure.The female guard gasped, “The Lance of Longinus!”“I’m a cute girl, not some weapon,” Sophia said, blinking her bright golden eyes and sticking out her tongue playfully.“That’s exactly why Liam Wei suggested bringing her — but I didn’t expect her to be… well, a bit off.” Kim sighed helplessly.“My apologies for the rudeness earlier. This way, please.” The female guard bowed respectfully and led them inside.

The Base, compared to the community, was a tented encampment within an old military compound. At noon, torches burned outside each tent. Members passed by busily, greeting Kim as they went, while others in protective suits sprayed an orange-colored gas around the perimeter.

Sophia looked uneasy. Her pupils reflected orange light as if analyzing the gas’s composition. Kim handed her a tissue, gesturing for her to wipe the sweat from her forehead.“Why are they spraying polysulfuric acid (H₂S₃O₂) today?” he asked.

Before the female guard could answer, a loud, cheerful voice drew everyone’s attention.“Welcome, Guardian Warrior Kim! Not only have you completed another mission for the survivors, you’ve brought us a special guest.”

Father Phano stepped out of his tent, warmly shaking Kim’s hand while studying Sophia with keen curiosity.“You’re the sage here, aren’t you?” Sophia asked, sensing in him a familiar aura — wisdom.“You flatter me, beautiful daughter of intellect,” Father Phano said, extending his hand.

When their hands touched, information flowed freely between them. For Father Phano, the sensation was both shocking and exhilarating — indescribably wondrous.“At last, the Daughter of Intellect has arrived. You are the hope of our world,” he said with emotion in his voice.“Let’s go inside my tent and talk in detail.”

Inside, the tent was filled with communication devices — it was practically a miniature intelligence hub. Once everyone sat, Father Phano took out a thick, Bible-like book and opened it.“The world became what it is today because of cause and effect. In the 1950s, Fog City was filled with despised sinners — people cast out by their own families. They came to the Cathedral of Seven Sins to pray for forgiveness. But due to the government’s neglect, they received no proper care.” He pointed at a picture of a man with a rotting face.“Ah, Absalom!” Sophia interrupted.“No, they were lepers — those afflicted with leprosy…”“They were Absalom. What are you talking about?”“They were lepers!” Father Phano retorted.“Enough, both of you, stop arguing,” Kim cut in, exasperated.“One’s a psychic lunatic, the other an old scholar who gets excited over books — what’s there to argue about?”

Realizing his loss of composure, Father Phano calmed himself and fell silent. A contradictory thought surfaced in his mind:

That relic given by the demon in my dream said that once hope is obtained, disaster will follow. The only thing that can end it is the Key of God. But the Key of God has no emotions — because a key has no soul. Yet you… you defy that truth at this crucial moment.

I can do small amounts of working out again, no where near the intensity that I used to and I have to give myself a lot of breaks. But I’m able to do a little bit without feeling like I’m going to pass out after 5 minutes.

I have felt the panicky feeling still but it doesn’t last long at all. My heart rate will go back down quicker than it used to. No more hour long panic attacks in the middle of the night.

I can drive short distances again (after one too many panic attacks while driving I would work myself up into them almost every time I got in the drivers seat).

I have gained about 10 lbs in the 2 months which I’m not thrilled about but I will take the extra weight for my overall well-being.

Another chance I’ve made is starting drinking half-caff low acid coffee. It’s helped my heart rate and jittery feeling. And with the GI issues I was having too.

Some of these might purely be mental. I’ve noticed with graves, aside from the physical effects, it can be a nightmare on your mental health. Not sure if these are temporary, all of these symptoms might come back occasionally but I’m enjoying these good moments for however long they will last.",1,1766593417.0,gravesdisease,2,1.0,False

“The reason humans are human is because they still believe in certain values…” Sophia repeated the phrase softly to herself.But what *was* that value, truly? She didn’t know.To live more like the humans of this world, she opened her sensory organs at night to absorb the information particles drifting in the air.By accident, she discovered something noteworthy.

**“Development Log of Experimental Subject Zero.”**

“What is this?” Driven by curiosity, Sophia absorbed the file — and immediately felt a faint sorrow.

“I am lonely.” That was the first sentence.

“Since childhood, I’ve known I was different. I don’t know why I exist — only that I enjoy thinking. Unlike other children, I couldn’t express myself, and even when I did, I was called a lunatic. Over time, I stopped speaking. At eighteen, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My parents couldn’t accept it and believed so-called experts who forced me into electroshock therapy. After countless escapes, they finally accepted the truth. Once I began taking the medication that suppressed my psychotic episodes, I realized how beautiful the world could be…”

The rest of the file had been deleted — except for the final line:

“I am Zero — the one who destroyed the city. To be born human… I am sorry.”

Sophia grew angry at the abrupt ending. Fortunately, residual data in the file showed the source came from the nearby civilian district.Changing her molecular composition, she moved toward that location — unaware that Liam Wei was silently trailing behind her.

When Sophia opened the target apartment’s door, Wei finally revealed himself.

“You completely hid your presence,” she said in surprise. “You’re not an ordinary survivor, are you?”

“Pretty lady, this isn’t a place you should be entering,” he replied with a teasing smile.

He remembered that the Federation had once warned him not to approach this area. Why — that wasn’t a question for someone of his rank to ask.

“If you insist on staying here,” he said lightly, “then don’t blame me for being rough.”

“Wait… I can feel it,” Sophia said softly. “Your emotions toward this place are a mix of obsession and curiosity — and defiance toward someone’s orders, aren’t they?”

Unlike Kim Jeok-woo, Wei already knew from Federation intel that Sophia could read human minds.

He recalled the day the Commander had briefed him.

“She is our key weapon to pierce the stars and the sea. She possesses the abilities of mental manipulation, teleportation, mind-reading, illusion creation, and spatial distortion. W-11, if you lose track of her during surveillance, I will not only send your family into the experimental sector — I’ll have part of your family and you relocated to the New Land for *re-education* under the Federation.”

“Yes, Commander. I will never forget your grace. Long live the Rabbit Federation!”

Just as his hand touched the grip of his pistol, countless golden lights appeared around Sophia. The lights gathered in her palm, forming a massive golden sphere.

She smiled in satisfaction. The sphere then transformed into a portable hard drive.

“Here. The data inside might become your strength.”

Humming a cheerful tune, she vanished before his eyes.

When Wei returned to the community, he was startled to find Sophia already there.Only then did he understand — creatures from the Illusory World like her were beyond human comprehension or control.

He stared at the hard drive on the table, unsure how to report this to the Commander.

“…Let’s see what’s inside first.”

The moment he touched the device, information surged into his brain like a tidal wave.

It was a *development log* titled**“Experimental Subject Zero.”**Zero had once posted it online in a foreign forum.

**Title:***I Don’t Think I’m Crazy, But Something Happened After I Posted My Sketch*

**Content:**Everyone, I don’t know how to explain this. I’m writing while suppressing fear and confusion, but I never thought I’d go insane.

About a week ago, after I uploaded one of my sketches online, strange things started happening in my city.

It’s a small Asian city that lives off gambling. When I was little, I could still see recovering lepers on the streets. That image inspired me to record it through drawing. But that day, after a flash of golden light, the lepers in my sketchbook *came to life.*

Their skin was still rotting. Their eyes were hollow. Their movements sluggish.

Yes… I saw them — those drawings became *real.*They were pulled from somewhere else into our world. I don’t know how to describe it — let’s just call them monsters. But one thing is certain — they stood right before me, alive.

I told my sister. She said it was because I slept too much. But this was real — why wouldn’t my only family believe me?

Was it because the news didn’t report it? Because everyone was too busy working? I don’t know. I only know that every night, as people slept, the monsters’ howls and the screams of humans echoed outside.

I’m overweight, and I used to eat midnight snacks. Since the monsters appeared, I haven’t dared to go out. The restaurants closed one by one before my eyes — the staff were torn apart by monsters.

My sister said it was just the economy. She lied. In this city, restaurants only close if their food is awful. While writing this, my skin started itching.

One night, I found flakes of skin in my sister’s room. Her eyes were always red now, her body odor stronger, and she was eating meat I couldn’t recognize.

I examined the meat — tasted it — and realized it was similar to chicken. Crunchy.

Was I eating it raw? I don’t know. But before humans discovered fire, they ate this way too. Nothing wrong with that… right?

After eating, I just wanted more. But sleep soon overtook me. I’ll keep writing until my sister returns… if I’m still alive tomorrow.

**Title:***My Sister Hasn’t Come Back — Please Help Me*

**Content:**It’s been two days since my last post. I don’t know if anyone saw it before it disappeared, but I have to keep writing.That means I’ve slept for two days straight. And throughout that time, one command kept repeating in my head:*Eat.*

It made me devour every piece of chicken left in the house.On the internet, I saw a moth using its proboscis to suck red viscous liquid off the street.The local news said a foreign religious group had launched a terrorist attack — but I didn’t care. I only wanted more chicken.

Oh right — something else. Just as I finished eating, a chill ran down my spine.The hairs on my body stood up. Sweat poured down my back.I felt someone whispering behind me. When I turned — A long-haired woman in white was standing on my balcony. Her pale skin was bloodless.

I called out to her, thinking she was my sister.But when she turned, her face had no features except two black pits where her eyes should be — black liquid streaming down from them.Then she vanished.

Now, even remembering it makes my heart race. I lick my long, sharp nails to suppress the fear.

At night, the streets are empty — only the smell of rot and burning garbage fills the air. The streetlights are dead, only the faint stars above.

While searching for a store, I saw a chicken leg squatting on the ground. It wasn’t strange to me. Hunger and curiosity led me closer. It trembled before a puddle of red liquid. I didn’t care. I bit down and chewed.

Then I saw it — a round, aged woman’s head rolling at my feet. I ran home in terror.

I grabbed my phone to call the police — but there was no [signal.In](http://signal.In) the dense apartment corridors, I heard shouting and screaming.I don’t know where my sister went. Thinking of her smooth skin made me salivate uncontrollably.

Please, someone — help me find her. I don’t know where she is.I’ll burn the sketchbook tonight. But it just opened on its [own.My](http://own.My) sister in the drawing is moving. She’s smiling at me.If anyone knows how to stop this, please tell me.

**Title:***The Fog-Filled City and the Doctor*

**Content:**After deciding to burn the sketchbook last night, I got a call on my signal-dead phone from a man named *Mephist.*

“Your work is remarkable. It’d be a shame to burn it. How about we trade — your drawings for more chicken meat?” he coaxed. It was tempting.

I thought it was a scam. The Federation always warned citizens about scammers.But when he showed up with credentials, I realized it was real.

“Your sister’s wish,” he said, “was for you to cooperate with us.” He looked at the sketchbook on the table, sipping his coffee.

“Yes, little brother, listen to the nice man,” I heard my sister’s voice in my head.

“You possess an extraordinary gift — the ability to make thoughts real,” he continued.“Among the Forsaken Flesh, you are a new breed — able to turn ideas into reality… including your sister.”

W-what? My sister… was created by me?

“Yes.” He smiled.

“You not only created your sister — you created part of the Fog City Experiment itself. Hahaha…” His laughter echoed like thunder in my skull.

The world spun. My mind collapsed. My memories pierced into me like the Sword of Damocles. Reality dissolved like a mirage.

Yes… I was never a fat man, never a sketch artist. My sister, my hunger — were delusions magnified after I was kidnapped.

The real me was strapped to an operating table after taking dopamine-based drugs. My consciousness drained as surgeons opened my [skull.My](http://skull.My) remaining proteins were connected to machines — to extract memories for use in constructing simulated worlds.The forum posts — just the experiment’s log.

“I… I’m not a patient. I’m just… just…” I broke down in despair.

“What a tragic life,” Mephist said with mock pity, his smile colder than death.

“But without pain like this, the toy wouldn’t feel real — or be any fun.”His grin deepened, carrying an inhuman malice — colder than absolute zero, deeper than the Mariana Trench.He wasn’t human. He was a monster wearing skin.

Then, a man in a suit entered. “How is the neural development proceeding?”

“Reporting, Leader. Subject Zero’s brain shows exceptional advancement. I believe the day we open the Gate of Truth is near,” the researcher said respectfully, handing over the report.

The Leader said nothing — he simply raised the lights. The brightness erased his shadow. In the glow of the lab, his face could only be described with one word — *demonic.*

Another researcher entered, pushing a cart of components. “Sir, we’ve prepared all the necessary human parts.”

Ah… isn’t that my favorite chicken leg?In the depths of my sorrow, I finally felt a fleeting satisfaction…

**“Development Log of Experimental Subject Zero — End.”**

After reading the log through Sophia’s information-sharing ability, a thought surfaced in Liam Wei’s mind — one he had never dared to think before.A forbidden thought.",1,1766593388.0,u_RedRoseScribe,0,1.0,False

My high school went by cuz jee preparations didn't date anyone. Then college was Covid batch, it went by too. 

Now at work negligible women colleagues, dating apps don't work. So in short I never had even considerable women around me who could notice me and maybe I can approach them.

There are other offices around my office where girls are there I mean they roam around in common open area, is it a good thing to randomly strike a hello Convo and introduce myself politely, but then since I never talked what should be the way to stay in touch, no it's not possible to see the same girl again because people don't roam at fixed times, it's monotonous, so should I approach them directly and ask for a coffee or ask for their number and what to talk about?, is it considered creep if I do this being non pushy and politely?

Also apart from it I don't think I got an option, dear ladies please tell where else can I approach politely and in a respectful manner and ask for a date maybe. And if I try to talk randomly what all should I ask someone to give hints that I like them kinda, like what to talk.
