1jhxyk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jhxyk1/kalita_155_with_185_papers_might_accidentally_be/,Kalita 155 with 185 papers might accidentally be making my most consistent brews?,"After giving up on 155 papers for always losing their shape and being almost too small to pour into, I started using my 185 papers and noticed that they weren’t just easier to use, but that they were brewing better coffee.

Recently, after learning more about contact points from Sibarist and their Booster disc, I had a bit of a realisation about what the 185 filters are doing to my brews — beyond just being easier to use.

Sibarist mention that when your filter seals tightly to the base of the brewer, it can create uneven resistance and restrict water flow, potentially leading to inconsistent drawdowns which can potentially lead to muddier brews. Their Booster lifts the filter slightly, creating consistent space and promoting more even flow through the coffee bed.

I noticed my 185 papers are kind of doing the same thing due to their larger size - they don’t fit all the way to the bottom of the brewer, and drawdowns were much faster and consistent, and most importantly, it was making better coffee. The paper floats slightly, meaning it doesn’t form a seal, which might be helping flow stay open and avoid that bottlenecking effect at the bottom of the bed.

I can safely say I’m struggling to find a better brewer/paper combination at the moment. I’m getting fast drawdowns, even extractions (helped by the incredible ZP6 grinder), and it’s just a super easy, consistent way to brew.",1,1742732252.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

March 18, – 6:45 AM Today, I decided things would be different. Instead of dragging myself out of bed for the usual routine, I resolved to simply stay under the covers and defy the script—at least for a little while. I lingered in the soft haze of sleep, determined to break free of the cycle that had defined my existence for so long. But as the minutes ticked by, an all-too-familiar dread took hold. At exactly 7:45 AM—the time when I would normally be boarding the metro—a sudden, disorienting flash seized me. In the next heartbeat, I found myself not in my disheveled bedroom, but rigidly seated at my office desk, clad in my standard work uniform. The change was as instantaneous as it was baffling. The office buzzed with the usual morning activity. Colleagues moved in quiet synchrony, each lost in their tasks. When their eyes fell on me, something in their expressions turned unnervingly vacant, as if my sudden appearance was merely part of their day’s backdrop. Overwhelmed by a surge of desperate rebellion, I rose from my seat and began to smash everything in sight. I hurled monitors to the floor, scattered stacks of papers into disarray, and crashed into furniture with a force I’d never known I possessed. The stunned silence that followed was chilling. Every coworker merely stared—unblinking, unmoving, their faces offering no reaction, only a disconcerting emptiness that amplified my isolation. Later that day, driven by a need to tear down the walls—literally and figuratively—I stepped outside the office building. With trembling resolve, I grabbed a can of gasoline which I don’t even remember how and doused the structure’s facade. In a flash, I struck a match, setting the building ablaze. The flames roared up the side of the building, a chaotic burst of heat and light that promised change, that might disrupt the endless cycle. But as the hours passed and I huddled at a safe distance, the inferno inexplicably dissolved—its char and destruction wiped clean from the memory of the city. The building stood pristine, unblemished, as if my defiance had been nothing more than a temporary illusion. March 19, – 6:45 AM I awake once again to the familiar chime of my alarm. The day unfolds with meticulous regularity—coffee at 7:15 AM, the crowded metro at 7:45, arrival at work by 8:30. The office, with its orderly rows and unchanging routines, welcomes me without a hint of yesterday’s chaos. No scorched walls, no lingering traces of shattered glass or scattered papers—every detail restored to its flawless state, as if my rebellion had never occurred. In that moment, a heavy resignation sinks in. Every attempt to break free is swallowed by the relentless perfection of this world that’s starting to not make any sense to me. Even now, as I settle into my chair, I can’t shake the haunting thought that any act of change, no matter how desperate, is absorbed into the unyielding routine leaving me trapped in an existence that refuses to change.

A year later….

March 14, – 11:30 PM A year has passed since that day of shattered rebellion, yet the city’s pulse remains unyieldingly precise. Every morning still begins at 6:45 AM, every routine unfolds like clockwork—so flawless, so maddeningly predictable. In the wake of my last defiant outburst, I learned to yield, to bury my dissent beneath the weight of habit. But tonight, something in me stirs. I sit in the dim light of my apartment, the quiet a stark contrast to the busy, orchestrated chaos that fills the day. My thoughts keep returning to that persistent, elusive email—a message that has haunted every March 15 since I first noticed it. Year after year, it appears at 9:00 PM, only to vanish by morning, leaving behind nothing but the ghost of a reminder. Tonight, as the hours wind down, I make a decision. I will not let it disappear into the void as it always has. I plan to read it the moment it arrives tomorrow. No more ignoring the sign, no more pretending that the tiny, recurring irregularity is a mere coincidence in the perfection of this mimicry. I lean back, the weight of anticipation mingling with a trace of dread. The idea that a single, stubborn email could unravel the mystery of my existence has kept me awake more nights than I can count. And so, with a resolve forged in countless repetitive days, I set my mind. Tomorrow, at 9:00 PM, I will finally confront that message. Until then, I lie awake in the quiet, waiting for the faintest hint that the cycle might finally be breaking

Currently have an 13” m3 air and I’ve started doing some studying for work and I’m having some issues with screen real estate (I’m forcing myself to go study in a coffee shop for an hour or two to prevent home distractions!) side note, I travel to them on my motorcycle if that makes a difference.

Anyway, spotted some 16” m1 pros for around £850 which is almost a straight swap in value for the m3 air. Would this be a wise move? I’ve eyed the 15 air but figured if I’m swapping I might as well get the better screen etc too? 

The airs fine specs wise (base model) but I need to be able to side by side stuff and my aging eyes just can’t do it on the 13 😂 I really don’t want to spend any extra money, I’d rather save that for certifications.

Any help/advice appreciated (maybe I’m missing something on the air that would make my use case easier?!)

1jhxt83,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jhxt83/best_way_to_reduce_retention_in_the_specilita/,Best way to reduce retention in the specilita without moving to single dose.,"Hi all,

Just been looking at reducing the retention of my specialita.

I use the machine with my partner who isn't keen on single dosing as she like the convience of the hopper.

What ways can I lower the retention? I'm looking at the tilt bases on easy atm.. do they have a noticeable impact?

Are there any other ways to reduce it?

My current workflow is;

Scales > blind shaker > grind > adjust to 21g (probably 20.7 to 21.3g) > shake > portafilter > wdt > tamp.

My partner is;

Grind > portafilter > tamp.

It's my role to dial things in and try to make it simple.

My goal is to reduce the retention to make her coffee more consistent. She doesn't weigh the output, she just presses the button and waits for it to end. My hope is that is the grams into the portafilter were more accurate than the whole process is more accurate.

Thanks all.

I (22F) work in a corporate and bonded well with a male friend (B, 24M) from a different department. We used to joke and have fun together, but things got weird when I started talking to another male friend (C). B started ignoring me and asked if I liked him because I stalked him on Instagram. I reassured him I didn’t have feelings for him, but things escalated with him avoiding me, forcing me to go for coffee, and getting upset when I declined. After a series of apologies, he broke the friendship, calling me ""moody."" We didn’t talk for 21 days, but when I tried to reconcile, he acted normal until he called C in front of me, and I teased him. He then accused me of having a ""loose character"" and said he didn't want to keep the friendship, claiming I was different from the other girls in his group. I’m confused about why he did this and now have to tell my family.

TL;DR:Why he had done that any idea ?Do he had a feelings for me? Even though we are just a friend ",1,1742731627.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

We haven't defined anything or talked about romantic histories.

I don't know why I'm having such a hard time reading signals to see if he's interested in me (ex. he initiates dates and texts me, but like when we hang out he won't touch or kiss me for like the first couple of hours, but he'll cuddle me at night). I feel like I'm holding back because I don't want to come on too strong.

I invited him to my house party yesterday. We spent a long time chatting in the kitchen with my friends, including a girl we both used to work with. But, when she asked if we were together he denied it immediately, and I followed suit.

I then made the mistake of drinking too much and so my memory of the night is a bit hazy. He and I went to my room for a bit to be alone where we chatted and hooked up, and afterwards I had enough liquid courage to ask ""What are we doing here"" to which he responded (something along the lines of) ""Are you sure/do you really want to have this conversation now?"", so I said no. He was right that it wasn't a good idea, but I felt embarrassed/shut down.

I'm just wracked with anxiety this morning - I'm worried I talked his ear off or was annoying or that I said the wrong thing.

Obviously I need to talk to him, at least for the sake of my piece of mind, but how? Something I'm working on in general is being braver in my relationships (romantic and platonic) and being honest with the people in my life about my feelings and talking about what's bothering me. Finally, my friend is trying to set me up on a blind date, and I'm on the fence. I'm not sure whether I should bring this up just to be upfront, or to talk about exclusivity in general and spare the details.

TLDR: I (F25) tried to have the ""what are we"" conversation with M25 when I was drunk and he said ""do you really want to have this conversation now"" so we didn't. Now I feel embarrassed and don't know how to bring it up again.",1,1742731519.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1jhxnos,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jhxnos,“Light ice”,"There are a ton of posts with a “full cup of ice” and complaints that there’s barely any actual drink so I wanted to show what regular and light ice actually look like.
 
 
“Light ice” at least for most drinks like refreshers/teas means roughly 40-50% less, it’s not a subjective amount nor is there a “very light ice” level. We have extra, regular, light, or no ice and each have their implications.
 
 
Attached are two pictures showing the liquid and ice amounts for regular ice on the left, and light ice on the right in a venti cup. 

 
Some drinks like teas or refreshers do scale very well with less ice, so long as they’re shaken they’ll still be chilled throughout and have the right ratio. But for other drinks the ratios are completely thrown off altering the taste significantly, or it’s just not an option on a type of drink. An example would be that Matcha tends to foam way more without the full amount of ice resulting in you getting a similar amount of drink either way. Shaken espressos do not have ice as an allowed customization on the app because having less makes it a different drink entirely (an iced latte with extra espresso). And a latte with light ice is just super milky since the espresso amount doesn’t change, which is totally cool if you prefer it but we can’t just “add more coffee” unless it’s ordered with it.",4,1742731216.0,starbucks,2,0.75,False

This is a defense game where you fend off waves of enemies each round.

To get the gear you want, you must follow recipes and assemble each part step by step to quickly create high-tier equipment and clear the stages.

Although crafting each piece of equipment according to its recipe can be tough, the satisfaction and thrill of completing it is what makes this game special.

I’ve always thought this kind of concept was fun, but it was hard to find a game like this on mobile or Steam—so I decided to make it myself.

The gameplay is relatively simple:

https://i.redd.it/7k27bqhwueqe1.gif

1. Defend against enemy lines appearing each round.

https://i.redd.it/o40kfcmxueqe1.gif

2. During downtime, enter the mining zone to gather resources (used for character growth).

https://i.redd.it/7r7t7qqyueqe1.gif

3. Combine equipment to upgrade it.

https://i.redd.it/6rk857szueqe1.gif

4. Use the crafted gear to survive up to round 60.

It’s available at a low price—about the cost of a cup of coffee!!.

If you're interested, please add it to your wishlist and follow!

I tried stopping many times thinking I can just have maybe 1 or 2, but we know how that story would end.
 I had to stop because I realized I just can't rationalize drinks, I'm either all in or what's the point mentality. And then again rock bottom was waking up having remembered taking a drink to bed and then the rest is a black hole.

I know we read these alot, and I've been doing well. Drink alot more tea and coffee. I have a partner much older than me and does not like going out, so most days I'm stuck at home. I've been doing fine, but today I find myself bored and my evil brain is saying just sneak out and get some. 
I swear I have adhd, and I get bored very quickly. I don't enjoy reading at all, and even a movie over 1 hour I begin to fidget. Drinking was the thing I turned to to relax me, calm me down and then eventually pass out.

What do you guys do. I've washed floors, put up new shelves, cleaned out storeroom. And now I'm sitting here saying to myself, a few quick shots won't do anything you will he fine.

At firstvI thought maybe my feelings for her is also mutual, since we always talk, having coffee or lunch breaks together. But I saw she is in general a kind and social person and she's is like this to everyone.

I seek solution ffrom you now, cause prolonging this situation further is not good and takes a lot of capacity from me. Should I just directly ask her out for a coffee on a weekend or do something else? I'm afraid if I very directly ask for a date I get rejected.

I’d like to introduce you to the Yonder Credit Card, which is currently offering 10,000 free points when you sign up [through a referral](https://join.yondercard.com/41oca4s). Here’s a brief overview of its features:

* App-based: Get a virtual card instantly and start using it with Apple Pay right after signing up.
* Earn up to 5 points per £ spent with the card.
* No foreign transaction fees when used abroad (it’s a Mastercard).
* Receive 10,000 points immediately upon signing up through a referral, plus free travel insurance for a limited time.
* Points can be redeemed for various experiences in London, such as dining, coffee shops, shows, and fitness classes.
* Experiences are updated monthly and are easily accessible through the app.
* Redeeming points is straightforward: pay with your card, request to use points within the app, and Yonder will credit your balance.

I've used this card on several city breaks recently, and it’s been fantastic. No fees, app notifications similar to Monzo, and you benefit from the Mastercard exchange rate.

Signing up is quick and takes about 5 minutes. The app’s KYC process is swift, and you’ll have your virtual card ready to use right away (the app is very user-friendly).

Use my referral link to sign up and get the 10,000 points, plus three months free of their Premium plan (normally £15 per month). With this plan, you'll earn 5 points per £ spent and enjoy free family travel insurance. Just remember to downgrade to the free plan before the three months end (you can do this via live chat in the app). The free plan is similar, except for the travel insurance, and you'll earn 1 point per £1 spent, which is still worthwhile.

If you sign up using my link, I'll also get 10,000 points, so it’s a win-win!

First Kiss.","So i (18M) went on a date with a girl (19F) and i think it went well. I was awkward a lot, but i fell for her then and there. Now i am worried what i should do next.

How the date went:
We went to the botanical garden and talked for about an hour. We also talked about anxiety, and since i have adhd i was apologizing a bit, and she told me i don't have to apologize so much, i was awkward lol.
Then we got coffee, she noticed my Ring and gave her hand, i gave her mine. She just wanted to see the ring hahaha, but it was okay, then we held hands.

I brought up the idea to go to the local mountain to watch the sunset(the mountain is more like a hill, with a train going up). Sadly the clouds were blocking the sun, but we laid in the grass, next to each other. We talked about if life is like the truman show, and then i laid my arm around her and she snuggled up to me. A couple minutes in silence went by, then we talked a bit about our dating experiences. 

I have never been in a relationship before, but that's okay. We also found out we are both bi, lol.

I asked her if i could kiss her, and mentioned i never had done that before. And then we kissed for a long time, there in the grass, and i really fell for her. I was shaking the whole time, but not just because it was cold.

We went down the mountain again and kissed in the train and at the bus station. We said we wanted to see each other again.
We also kissed goodbye at the end.

When i got home i texted her that today was great and that i hope she gets home safe.

She replied with something along the lines of yeah she agrees and sounded excited.

But her replies now are short, tbh they were also short before and i found out she doesn't talk as much as i do.
She's also taking time to reply, but she did beforehand too.


But now i am overthinking so hard, because i really like her and don't know what i should do. I really want to see her again!

Could someone give me some reassurance please? :)

1: vanilla ice coffee protein powder (30g) (I use bodylab, this flavor tastes good and that’s coming from someone who isn’t that big on coffee)


2: egg yolk, tempered


3: guargum 1/2tsp


4: milk 3% until at border


5: cottage cheese 40g


6: liquorice powder 1 - 2 tsp depending on how u want it


7: Ammonium chloride 1/4th or 1/2th tsp depending on how u like it (make sure it’s not already in your liquorice powder)


8: regular salt, pinch 


9: optionally if u want more coffee flavor, add coffee 


10: vanilla bean powder, a pinch


11: erythritol, 20g


Directions:


1: mix everything with an immersion blender until smooth 


2: freeze for 24 hours


3: spin on appropriate setting (for me it was ice cream setting as mine was quite soft)


4: serve forth

Does it scare me? Yes. 
Pero bakit ko siya pinili? It's because of how much he has sacrificed for me and our relationship. How he made sure that I am his priority and that his goal is to be a better man and make me happy.

He went back to college. Nag quit na siya sa pag inom and pagbabarkada. He'd accept odd jobs to support himself and his studies. Ang totoo, walang wala siya ngayon pero never niya sa akin pinaramdam na hindi niya kaya. He'd gift me flowers every time. Tanda niya na mas preferred ko yung binalot lng ng papel o plastic kaysa sa magarbong bouquet arrangements dahil nilalagay ko agad sa vase. Dadalhan niya ako ng almusal, plato at kutsara sa opisina. Kapag may extra siya, bibilhan niya ng ice candy o ice cream ang mga katrabaho ko. Minsan naman magdadala siya ng prutas galing sa kanila. Unang pasko naming magkakilala, wala siyang pambili ng cake, kaya dalawang sakong buko pang salad ang dinala at binigay niya sa mga magulang ko. Kapag may pera, bibili siya ng isang kahon ng herbal coffee at ireregalo sa Mama ko. Seaman ang kuya ko, at kapag nasa barko, ihahatid niya sina ate at pamangkin gamit ang tricycle papunta sa kabilang lungsod. Gigising siya nang sobrang aga para lang maihatid ako. Magsusundo. Ipagsusuot ako ng medyas, sapatos, jacket at helmet palagi. Pupunasan ang upuan o semento bago ako umupo. Magbubukas ng inumin at sisiguraduhing ako muna ang mauunang uminom. Ilalayo ako sa tabi ng kalsada at ipaghahain ng pagkain bago pa siya maunang sumubo. 

Hindi siya kaagad natanggap ng pamilya ko. Hindi siya mayaman, hindi siya ang pinangarap nila para sa akin. Pero ipinaglaban ko dahil alam kong aalagaan niya ako at ang nakaraan ko. Totoong may mga Gwan-sik pa sa mundo. And watching When Life Gives you Tangerines reminds me that happiness isn't all about the material things..but to grow with someone who genuinely cares.

I hope it’s ok to post here. I posted on another sub and some comments were a little insulting. I (46f) met a younger man (30m) through a dating app a few months ago. He said he likes older women. We both wanted casual only. We were chatting online for awhile then met for a coffee date. We were attracted to each other so we met for sex twice in the last couple of months. First time at his house. Second time at my house. In between we didn’t have much communication except in the lead up to our meetings. In person he’s a nice guy and was very respectful toward me. Anyway the other day I decided to rejoin the dating app that we first met and I came across his profile which is no surprise and I just swiped left because there’s no need to try match with him. Later in the same day of rejoining the app, HE ‘liked’ me i.e he swiped right. At first I thought it was funny because men tend to do that on the apps - they swipe right to try get as many matches as they can. I messaged him a joke about it but he hasn’t seen the message yet. However, the more I think about it, it is actually a real insult and humiliating. I’m feeling incredibly hurt by this because it feels like he doesn’t even know what I look like or remember me. It’s a bit fucked up actually. Am I wrong in thinking and feeling this way? Am I taking it too seriously? Is he just that detached that he didn’t realise it was me when he swiped right?

A male friend of mine reckons he did notice me and he’s making a statement. ‘It’s a nod’ that he likes you. But that doesn’t make any sense at all. ",2,1742730136.0,dating_advice,8,0.75,False

He had been in therapy for childhood trauma where attachment work was starting and he bailed out. He has a dismissive-avoidant attachment which has been something that I’ve had to learn to make space for in our relationship. It’s not just a pop-psychology term I’m throwing out. Suggesting normal secure relationship tactics don’t work here which is why I’m specifically asking for help from people who have been married to dismissive avoidants or who are one themselves. This is hard to understand if you’re not one or have not been with one. 

We have a generally good marriage, we’ve been together for 10 years, married for 9. We have 2 children. Things are hard right now because we’ve made some major decisions to solidify our future and we’re in the middle of the uncomfortable part that’s supposed to get us to a better place (financially and with the house). For this to just end abruptly right now would be devastating for everyone, him included. 

We’ve had a lot more conflict than normal lately. He works in a remote community and rotates between being away for 2 weeks and being home for 2 weeks. I’d say the last 3 times he was home, we fought more than usual. It was always over something small, and generally we’d come back together after the fight. But he seemed to be really struggling with his emotions. 

Before he left the last time we’d shared a heart to heart about the future. We made some plans about next steps in our careers (we’re both planning education around each others’ schedules and we did a check in on the time line for that), he reaffirmed his desire to remain with the family for the long haul, and we shared a long embrace. 

Fast forward to the middle of his time at work and he started talking about needing some time to sort out his feelings. I obliged him because I know his avoidant tendencies and wanted to support him, so we made plans for him to stay somewhere else for a little while so he could have some much needed time for himself. This was a weird transition because he didn’t have his normal 2 weeks off and was only “home” for 5 days. I had expected him to take a day or 2 to decompress and then come home, but instead, he asked me to meet him for coffee where he told me he doesn’t want to be married anymore.

I asked him to attend an emergency couples therapy session with me where it was revealed that he was struggling heavily with his feelings, that he feels very unhappy with himself and it seems to be made worse when he’s home with the family. He did not commit to proceeding with couples therapy, only to attend 2 more appointments and to think about whether he wants to stay.

What the fuck do I do? This is not the decision of a mentally well man, but I can’t stop him from absolutely blowing up our lives in order to avoid dealing with this. He hasn’t even considered what this has been like for me or the kids (they haven’t seen him in a month, and now he’s gone again for 3 weeks). He has it in his head that somehow we can still continue on as a family by just removing the marriage obligation which is absolutely detached from reality. I am who I am with him because I love him and am committed to him. Removing the marriage obligation would completely change the dynamic in a way he hasn’t even considered. 

Obviously this isn’t the kind of person I want to be with… the way he’s dealing with everything is shocking and cruel, but this isn’t HIM. There is something very wrong and I’m so scared.

Has anyone married to an avoidant ever dealt with this and got through it? Are there any avoidants who have experienced this themselves? 

For info: I do not believe he is seeing anyone else. At first the suddenness made me question whether that was the case, but he says no. Besides that, his work doesn’t allow free time. He basically works 16 hours a day and then goes to quarters to sleep. We share bank accounts/credit cards and phone locations so I would know if he was in unusual places or spending money in new ways. I can also see our cell bill where there are no repeated texts or calls to numbers I don’t recognize.

Location : Hometown : Ahmedabad Workplace : Ahmedabad ; Rajasthan ( I spend couple of weeks in Rajasthan as my factory is here)

Occupation : Family Business and an start idea (I m still working on creating my own legacy)

Religion : Hindu

Why am I Childfree : Call it selfish, I just feel I want to travel the world and enjoy life without having kids to hold me back but I feel my parents were pretty amazing as parents yet I ain't exactly the perfect person, I have my flaws and traumas. I just don't think I have it in to be the reason for a trauma for anyone especially my kids. Also, we live in a fucked up world, so why to bring a child to this world knowing the miseries?

Hobbies : Cooking, Writing (Sometimes it's shayari/ sometimes it's rant and sometimes it's romance), reading to a point where I have a mini library in my house, playing and watching cricket ( Not a huge fan anymore though), Philosophy and psychological conversations with strangers ( I believe I m here to listen to stories about life and lessons so love deep conversations).

More about me : I m ambitious yet I would take a day off in the name of self care. Even though I was born in Ahmedabad, I have hardly stayed in Ahmedabad (To the point that I don't have any friends in Ahmedabad). I have travelled a lot growing up which includes places like Mount Abu, Jaisalmer, Jaipur, Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. I have stayed multiple years at these places while growing up. It meant I know a lot of people but aren't really friends with? I have lost more people in my life than a normal human so that means I appreciate the time I spend with people rather than being scared to take that leap with people.  
Past Relationships/ Love life : I have had two serious relationship which lasted 6 months and 5 years (On and Off), I don't hate or would never call them toxic just cause it ended. It was beautiful while it lasted so why to blame the memories when they are gone?  
What I like : Food, Books, Stories, Romance, Coffee, Movies and tv series which are all about stories, light hearted tv shows, silence with the fav person and work which I do ( I m workaholic and absolutely love what I do), skincare and self care.

I've grown up with collies all my life but never seen a collie do this behaviour so thought I'd ask to see if anyone else has had this experience 😂

So basically we have a Beko coffee machine and whenever it's put on he just goes round and round in circles around the kitchen table, but he's wagging his tail and is so happy. Then when the hoover is on he goes mental for it, same goes for the car pressure washer we've got.

Also noticed with our Ninja ice cream machine he goes mental for that too. But I do want to stress he doesn't appear to be in any distress at all and if anything seems to love and waits for these machines to go on 😂

Curious to know if anyone knows why he's wired like this? Far as we're aware he was kept in a barn for 3-4 years with a whole bunch of other dogs who were all not very well looked after. So could just be the noises are very alien to him and get him excited.",1,1742729121.0,dogs,2,1.0,False

I am not someone who frequently has tonsil stones, maybe a couple times a year, & definitely not ever huge ones. Tonight, after two days since recovering from the flu I drank plain hot coffee around 8hr ago because I have been battling terrible week long constipation. The heat seemed to have brought up everything embedded in my tonsils from the serious post nasal drip (Is this possible?). It was several hours after drinking my coffee, while crying hard over something, I began to cough & cough until I was vomiting + gagging profusely. I coughed up at least three large tonsil stones after minutes of endless gagging. It is currently 7am, I have not slept more than 4hrs in the last day over anxiety about my current life, so I am maybe dramatic. I am so upset, I can’t get this last one out— It feels huge. I have never felt anything like this. I want to sleep terribly, to deal with it in the morning. I can’t see it, I have been trying for hours. I feel it so vividly when I breathe + swallow, but can’t find it. I am very afraid of developing tonsillitis. Or strep. I catch strep frequently. How likely is this from one stuck tonsil stone? The ones I coughed up were disgusting. I really cannot afford to get sick again right now. I just recovered from serious flu. I have to move out with my partner into our first apartment by the end of the week & have so much to do. I am so afraid of being unable to dig it out. Sorry for being such a baby, but can anyone please help me or inform me of if I will be fine for tonight? Is there a chance it will be gone come morning time? This is an absolutely horrible feeling, & throat pain leaves me suffering like nothing else. I am so afraid of infection. My tonsil looks so swollen but no pain. Just an awful stuck feeling. Will I be okay? Will I develop infection? Will drinking more hot drinks pull the rest out in the morning? Thank you in advance 🙏 sorry if I’m posting wrong.

Having a history of cocaine addiction, myself and my best friend. 
My last consumption was 1 month ago, without it being a relapse, following my complete withdrawal 6 months ago. 
My best friend stopped last week, after announcing it to her mother who now supervises her. 
And having been an alcoholic to the highest degree but having been weaned for more than a year, nevertheless maintaining excessive consumption following withdrawal, without however developing a new physical dependence, excessive consumption stopped 5 months ago still retaining a tendency to be unable to stop as long as there was still drinking (8 to 14 standard doses) during my occasional consumption of alcohol (≈ 1 to 2 times per week), tendency gone for 1 month From now on, I have a healthy relationship with alcohol consumption and only drink very occasionally in limited quantities (1 to 3 standard doses), without any temptation to drink more. 
I was staying with my partner, who generally hates alcohol and drugs, with my best friend who was in hospital and graciously lent us her house during this time (2 months). 
She had leave for Christmas, New Year's Day and sometimes on Saturdays for the day. 
She and I actually drank a bottle of champagne each for Christmas. And we smoked CBD, my
spouse considering that consumption of CBD is equivalent to consumption of THC. 
Note that I had asked my addictologist beforehand if following my cessation of THC I could afford to switch to CBD in order to fight against temptation, an agreement which he gladly gave me, seeing no disadvantage in it. 
Same for New Year's Day she and I drank, a little more this time, there was a bottle of red wine here as well as two bottles of prosecco and we also smoked CBD on this occasion. 
CBD during my stay there also remained in my daily habits, at the rate of one or two joints of CBD each evening. During my stay, being also under treatment: [Ritaline LP, Valium, Tramadol, Sertraline], medications that my partner also abhors, and having knowledge on the subject, he tried hard to connect the different medications prescribed to me with the behaviors in my home that bothered him and in particular with behaviors typical of the borderline disorder from which I suffer, explaining to me how I found myself with a diminished mind because of disorder, the expression of irrational feelings which he refuses to understand because not coming from any logic they are not to be considered as deserving to dwell on it, the certain phases of impulsiveness, the certain phases of vexation and the need to take refuge alone and illustrated his speech on the basis of comparisons with his ex-girlfriends who were under some of these same treatments, all described as having ""played stupid"". 
Our relationship situation was deteriorating, and having my treatments available, I actually overdosed myself, more and more. At the same time, there are phases of craving for alcohol. He actually refused to hear that I could be heartbroken since the deterioration of our relationship was as well as his detachment were subsequent to a lack of tenderness and confidence in him (according to his definition it is therefore a question of listening to what he tells me to do so that everything goes as well as possible, since he holds the power of ultimate logic, having an IQ considered to belong to the class of geniuses, with a dominance of intelligence articulated around pure logic). Nevertheless, if I showed little tenderness it was because the situation implied in particular that he
to make a choice between him and my family, an ultimatum imposed by my parents, in addition to the fact that he sometimes spoke to me about the calculations he had made to estimate the lifespan of our relationship which was therefore three months according to his predictions, borderline disorder obliges, I suffer from an unhealthy fear of abandonment, so faced with this situation, my tendency is actually more to withdraw. Concerning the trust I had to place in him, some of his suggestions were inaccessible to me, such as neglecting the situation relating to my family, stopping said treatments and as well as CBD, not taking refuge alone when I wanted to carry out certain of my activities such as writing or drawing, knowing that anxiety prevents me from carrying out a wide range of activities if someone else is in the same room. The overdoses I was taking eventually began to actually make me unpleasant, and so we grew further apart, and I seemed sad. When my best friend got a leave of absence, I suddenly seemed jovial, even though we weren't doing much together, drinking coffee and chatting as usual. My partner was therefore excessively irritated to see me able to invest this energy to “do nothing” while with him I was gloomy or stunned by my doses of valium or tramadol most of the time, taking refuge in sleep a lot. He himself ended up falling back into a depressive episode, which prevented him from working since trading is a profession requiring concentration and where one cannot allow oneself to be dominated by stress. According to him, his depression was my fault. Which shouldn't have been wrong. But he therefore reproached me for being unfit to work, for no longer having the desire to practice sport, which is among his favorite hobbies, after chess, an additional reason for which he was also angry with me, since I refused to play against him, knowing his excellence in play and being only a beginner myself while knowing that he does not tolerate errors resulting from a lack of reflection, and having heard how he defined his playing opponents who committed this type of errors, I did not want to expose myself to them. 
I felt degraded by many of his comments, being autistic with Asperger's, he always expresses himself with not very delicate honesty, so some of his comments broke my heart, a little more, but he categorically refused that the wrongs were even shared, it was only my sole responsibility since he did everything as best he could as he said. 
I drank a third time in the company of my best friend during one of her leaves, so that we could toast in honor of my birthday a few days before the official date, the two of us drank approximately 1L2 out of the 1L5 bottle of prosecco we had bought, my partner remained in the living room, blasé at the idea of ​​knowing that we were still drinking. 
This event will have marked him, from the same evening to a few days later he will have frequently taken offense at the quantity we had consumed and he regarded us with keen contempt regarding this moment. 
I found out I was pregnant, shortly after he left at the request of my best friend since he refused to share with me the costs of water and electricity bills, since he had already spent a lot on food shopping. 
We had already argued the day before, again around this story of 1L2 of prosecco shared in two in the afternoon with my best friend. Also since that day, my best friend in crisis wanted lamaline or ritalin or anything else to calm down, her frenzied state was somewhat worrying, but we had nothing and she had also sent me a message of apology the same evening for having wanted so much to buy a bottle since it was indeed her initiative, a deep desire to try to escape a little from reality. 


From now on I am living in my partner's family home and with my best friend we had planned that I would come to her house on occasion and that she would organize a photo shoot with a talented photographer that she knows, on a floral theme, she tells me, telling me the news that night when I spoke with her on the phone, so we will be led to create ornaments of real flowers aimed at enhancing clothes, skin, hair... 
When I come home I will announce it directly to my partner with the idea of ​​organizing myself to find out if he would like to come: 

before I can even ask him he just says ""ah ok well do what you want"" before pretending to sleep while he was wide awake the second before, so I insist to find out what annoys him ""oh well there will be lots of cocaine and there will be lots of alcohol it will be great"" in a tone full of disdain, I first try to tell him that it's really not the project, he then tells me that it doesn't matter, he will go to Paris or Bordeaux (so to see the ex with whom he was most deeply in love and with whom he will have shared the most memories and of whom he knows that I am slightly jealous since I know how good he felt with a time) that same weekend, I then tell him that it is as he wished but that he would be welcome at my best friend's house, telling him also that since they are both taking up the synth at the moment then they could have fun to compose a little something together, he tells me that he is not interested, then he was not invited originally, whereas we are at the origin, and that he would therefore go more for his weekend in Bordeaux, so I can understand what it feels like, sk doing as usual is the only way to make me realize what I am making him endure. 
Telling me that “if you mess up, you get out”. I try to tell him that now I have fairly good control and that I have no desire to take the risk of falling back into my past vices. He tells me that in any case with my best friend it can only happen like this. I tell him that he typically hurts me at this moment, he who does not believe me when I tell him that I am hurt by many of his comments in recent days, he laughs in my face telling me that it is not my place to be hurt. I insist so he prepares to leave for the living room downstairs, he was on the bed, I climb astride him to hold his gaze and ask him to explain himself further. So at that moment he grabs me and turns me abruptly on the bed to get rid of my grip so he can get off. 
So I joined him in the living room, repeating to him that if he came then he would have no reason to worry since we could leave quickly if the situation ever became truly dangerous for me by being exposed to certain temptations, to which he told me that it was a categorical no for his coming: it is better that I go and destroy myself and ruin our relationship alone rather than endure the fact of observing him and depressing him even more since even by his side I will be incapable of restraining myself. 
So I do what I want but there is a 99% chance that I will go off the rails and end our story. 
I then ask him if he still considers me a drug addict: “there is a little better but a month ago you had already broken down so yes”
I repeat to him that he hurts me and ask him why attack me directly when I talk to him about it rather than discussing it calmly ""lol it's you who's hurt when it's me who suffered this situation in Mezières every time before"" He laughs again telling me ""and it's you who's hurt. ask anyone, everyone would find it totally abnormal already if you ask my stepfather and my mother they think that I am much too cool with you”

SO, DOES EVERYONE FIND THIS REACTION LEGITIMATE AND MY SUFFERING ABNORMAL?

Ikeda Sensei’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes”: Opening Our Eyes to Nichiren’s Compassion. Post #21,"*‘Opening of the Eyes’—A Call to Open Our Eyes to Nichiren*: March 2025 installment of Ikeda Sensei’s lecture on [The Opening of the Eyes](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/opening-of-the-eyes-a-call-to-open-our-eyes-to-nichiren-to-open-our-eyes-to-the-people/). Today we conclude Section 7, “Opening Our Eyes to Nichiren’s Perseverance and Compassion.”

Why do I practice? What is the purpose of the SGI? When Guy and I met our sponsors, I never thought about “getting something” as the reason for chanting. There was something much deeper at play, perhaps discovering how to find my way to a dignified life after so many years of self-doubt and self-deprecation.

Sensei now recalls two points from President Toda, “striving to help people attain enlightenment” and realizing “a fundamental inner transformation in the lives of all humankind.” He called on members to devote themselves to “the Buddha’s work”:

>Enabling all people to become Buddhas, elevating the character of all people to something of supreme value—this is what it means to carry out ‘the Thus Come One’s work’ (see LSOC, 202).

President Toda quoted from “The Opening of the Eyes”: ‘When it comes to understanding the Lotus Sutra, I have only a minute fraction of the vast ability that T’ien-t’ai and Dengyo possessed. But as regards my ability to endure persecution and the wealth of my compassion for others, I believe they would hold me in awe’ (WND-1, 242). President Toda states:

>”The profound meaning behind this passage is the Daishonin’s commitment—to which he gave his entire life—to make it possible for all human beings to attain Buddhahood. This is a vivid example of ‘the Thus Come One’s work.’” 

>”My fellow members of the Soka Gakkai, we, too, must carry out this work. How, then, should we strive to enable all people to obtain the state of Buddhahood?” 

Drawing from “MY Fantasy Life” *(credit: Eigenstien)*, many Spring Season clients arrived yesterday. Yes, we charge a premium here for a season. We not only offer a beautiful location and facilities, but also we work hard at creating a sense of community. Morning coffee, daily trips to Costco/Starbucks, an open Rec Room, warming huts, symposia and events. We love-bomb our clients when they arrive because that is the world we are trying to create in one micro-speck of the universe.

“No,” we told the Twinettes during breakfast, “we cannot go ice-skating today because we have to work.” Over a course of 30 minutes they re-invented every form of protest ever conducted. There was a hunger strike (they refused to eat their Cheerios), chants (“We want to skate!”), civil disobedience (blocking the door so we couldn’t leave the trailer), discourse (“Pleeeeeze? Pleeeeeze?), and marches (“Ice skate! Ice skate! Ice skate!” with stomping). It was so cute! We relented and I took them after all.

Yes, I skated with them for a while. But I also took a break to observe them. So much was going on, I realized, beyond skating around the rink! They don’t share DNA but there is still that silent coding, a private language of sorts that twins develop. June Rus’ pointed with her eyes to someone who was skating with very long strides and the next thing I knew, she and Truth were skating behind the lady and imitating her. Truth now spotted a couple skating while cross-holding two hands together, the next thing I knew, she and June Rus’ were skating the same way.

Two sisters skating together…but also a beautiful model of human interaction, the way people are supposed to behave. I was a witness to it! And this is the purpose of our districts and groups—creating a model of human interaction within a community.

We headed home after one session and I was able to firmly say “No!” to the begs for a second one. “You already had your protest for the day,” I thought. We headed back to the Park to greet more clients.

One couple, we knew, had lost their daughter to cancer over the winter. What do you say? “Sorry for your loss” seems so trite. They were hooking up to the water, sewer, and electrical lines when we arrived. They, of course, had known the Twinettes since they were born. Not only did the Twinettes remember them, but they wanted to rush and say hello. Big hugs all around. The girls wanted to show our friends their ice skates, helmets, hockey sticks and pucks. Our friends were delighted and maybe for a few moments their grief subsided. Yes, the Twinettes were doing “the Buddha’s work.”

Sensei now concludes Section 7:

>With his vision of universal enlightenment and the inner transformation of all humankind, Nichiren brought forth the “power of endurance in the face of persecution” and the “power of compassion” in order to establish and propagate the entity of the Law. 

>Inheriting Nichiren’s spirit, the Soka Gakkai has—since the time of first president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi—embraced Nichiren Buddhism as the teaching for transforming reality and energetically advanced the struggle to lead humankind toward genuine happiness.

1jhwvnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/1jhwvnh/transcendental_crunch_deconstructing_the/,Transcendental Crunch: Deconstructing the Post-Breakfast Existential Paradigm,"Abstract: This paper endeavors to explore the profound epistemological implications of breakfast cereal consumption within the framework of radical solipsism. By employing a deconstructionist methodology, we aim to demonstrate that the perceived objectivity of cereal flakes and their associated milk-matrix is, in fact, a subjective construct, a manifestation of the individual's ontological isolation.

1. Introduction: The Cereal as a Signifier of Subjective Reality

The seemingly mundane act of consuming breakfast cereal presents a fertile ground for the exploration of post-structuralist solipsism. The very notion of a ""flake,"" a purportedly discrete object, is a linguistic construct, a signifier devoid of inherent meaning. As the individual engages in the act of mastication, they are not merely consuming a physical entity, but rather, participating in a semiotic ritual, affirming their subjective dominion over their perceived reality.

2. The Milk-Matrix: A Fluid Ontology

The introduction of milk into the cereal bowl further complicates the ontological landscape. The milk-matrix, a fluid and amorphous substance, represents the inherent instability of perceived reality. Its viscosity, its temperature, its very presence, are all subject to the individual's subjective interpretation. The concept of ""too much"" milk, as posited in the initial query, highlights the arbitrary nature of objective measurement within a solipsistic framework.

3. Tony the Tiger and the Illusion of Inter-Subjectivity

The presence of Tony the Tiger, or any cereal mascot, serves to illustrate the illusory nature of inter-subjectivity. These anthropomorphic representations, purportedly external entities, are in fact, projections of the individual's psyche, manifestations of their desire for connection within their self-constructed reality. The ""frosted flake,"" a symbol of idealized perfection, underscores the individual's yearning for a stable, objective reality, a yearning that is ultimately futile within the confines of radical solipsism.

4. Quantum Cereal Dynamics and the Collapse of Objective Reality

Drawing upon the principles of quantum mechanics, we can further deconstruct the perceived objectivity of cereal consumption. The act of observation, of perceiving a ""crunch,"" induces a collapse of the wave function, solidifying the cereal's perceived existence within the individual's subjective reality. The ""popped corn,"" a seemingly simple entity, becomes a complex interplay of probabilities, a manifestation of the individual's cognitive entanglement with their breakfast.

5. The Moldy Coffee Grounds: A Derridean Deconstruction of Breakfast and the Crisis of Empirical Evidence

The aforementioned incident of moldy coffee grounds serves as a stark reminder of the inherent instability of the constructed reality. The mold, a symbol of decay and entropy, disrupts the carefully curated illusion of objective order. This event, in its grotesque mundanity, forces a deconstruction of the breakfast paradigm, revealing the underlying chaos that permeates the individual's subjective experience. This revelation of the ""real"" intruding upon the perceived, can be seen as a direct refutation of the naive realism that, as Sokal (1996) so aptly demonstrated, permeates the very foundations of scientific discourse. We must ask, is the mold, in its tangible, olfactory presence, merely another social construct, a linguistic signifier devoid of inherent meaning? Or is it a stark, putrid reminder of the limitations of our subjective reality, a challenge to the very notion of a stable, objective breakfast?

6. Conclusion: The Cereal Bowl as a Solipsistic Universe

In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that the consumption of breakfast cereal is not merely a mundane act, but rather, a profound exploration of the solipsistic condition. The cereal bowl, a seemingly simple container, becomes a microcosm of the individual's subjective universe, a testament to the inherent instability and illusory nature of perceived reality. Future research should focus on the deconstruction of other breakfast staples, such as toast and eggs, to further illuminate the ontological implications of culinary consumption.

As you can see I also drink a lot of filter coffee so a grinder that can do both would be nice but is not a must - I still enjoy hand grinding for that. The main use for the new grinder will be espresso or espresso based drinks.

My main criteria: 
• Aesthetically pleasing - I don't like the looks of the Niche
• Appropriate size - shouldn't be much smaller than the espresso machine but also not huge
• High quality
• My region: Germany
• Budget could be streched by 10-15% if absolutely necessary

I had a glass of water from the night before, on the dresser beside me. I drank the rest of the water left and found myself still thirsty, but I made due with the coffee cuz I couldn't be bothered to get up yet. 

We kept chatting for some time, before I notice my glass is suddenly full of water, asking my partner if he refilled somehow. He said he only made the coffee, and I realized I'd emptied the glass right before he sat down with me, and none of us had gotten up since then.

The water was closer to room temp than cold, and the glass had tiny air bubbles all over the inside, like it had been sitting there for a while. 

If he were to fill it for me, it would be ice cold, as he always makes it. I chalked it down to being a glitch, and happily drank my water!

1jhwqmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1jhwqmo/the_gathering/,The Gathering,"The basement light flickered erratically, as if unsure whether to stay on or surrender to the encroaching darkness. The air was thick, damp, stagnant, laced with the faint scent of mold.

I sat on the cold concrete floor, my cousin beside me. Across from us, the woman from Liburon leaned forward, her wide grin splitting her face in two. Beside her sat a man; older, silent, but his lips curled with quiet amusement.

If you knew Liburon, you’d understand. It was deep in the mountains, a place deep in the mountains, where the signal was nonexistent and the roads felt like they lead to nowhere. People who went there never stayed too long. Some never came back at all.

And then she began to speak, it wasn’t a story. It was a confession. “There were children,” she said, her voice springing with delight. “An entire classroom of them.” The words slithered into my ears, sticky and suffocating. As she spoke, something shifted inside my head.

The room blurred. My breath hitched.

And then I saw it.

An old, sepia-toned photograph flickered before my eyes... clear, crisp, undeniable. A classroom. Rows of Filipino children, their faces eerily blank, their bodies stiff with forced composure. At the back stood their teacher, her posture rigid, unnatural. Her face... It was crossed out. Thick, black ink, violently slashed over her features. 

The woman’s voice went on, rising and falling like a lullaby. I didn’t want to listen, but the words kept forcing themselves into my skull.

She was describing how she killed them.

Every.
Single.
One.

The way they screamed. The way their tiny fingers trembled before going limp. The way their blood seeped into the wooden floorboards, dark and endless.

And the worst part?

She was smiling. She relished every detail. Each method. Each cut. Each broken body.

It was her masterpiece.

The man beside her chuckled, a deep, guttural sound that slithered down my spine. They were enjoying this.

I forced a smile. So did my cousin. We exchanged uneasy glances, silently pleading with each other to play along.

But she noticed. Her grin faltered. Her eyes, sharp, and calculating, flicked between us.

Then, her expression softened.

“You should leave.”

No change in her voice. No explanation.

But the air grew suffocating, pressing against my chest like invisible hands. I didn’t hesitate. I scrambled up, my cousin close behind.

Then—

Blackness.

When I opened my eyes, I was home. In the room beside the front door, the one no one liked to stay in. But something was off.

Voices murmured around me, laughter weaving through the air... 

A gathering.

Church members filled the house, sipping coffee, lost in quiet conversation. The hum of their chatter should’ve been comforting, familiar.

But then... I saw her. Standing in the kitchen. Smiling. The woman from Liburon.

The memory slammed into me with the force of a speeding truck. A scream clawed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, turning sharply to my mother.

I told her everything. Every single thing. The basement. The story. The children. Yet... She only frowned.

She didn’t believe me. No matter how I pleaded, no matter how desperately I tried to make her see, she only shook her head.

Frustrated, I shoved the proof into her hands—something real, something solid. Something I knew mattered.

But... 

I couldn’t remember what it was. It was important. I was sure of it. And yet, my mother barely glanced at it before sighing.

Then, she did something that made my stomach lurch.

She turned. And handed it to the woman. A slow, knowing smile stretched across the woman’s lips. She denied everything, her voice smooth, sweetened.

Then, she turned to me. Her eyes locked onto mine. And in them, a silent promise.

""Patay ka nako."" (you're dead) 

My breath stopped. My pulse pounded against my skull, my fingers twitching with the overwhelming urge to run.

I looked at my mother, my voice breaking as I begged her to listen, to believe me. She only smiled, soft, and empty, like I was a child lost in nightmare and delusion.

And then..  .   ... 

One by one, the people began to disappear.

The warmth in the house drained.

The conversations faded.

The walls darkened, stretching, shifting.

The air grew thick with something unseen, something that coiled around my limbs, tightening, pressing.

And then......... 

A sound.

Low.

Ambience.

Growing louder.

Closer.

Something was here.

Watching.

Waiting.

I clenched my fists.

I tried to move, but my limbs refused.

Five seconds.

Five agonizing seconds of stillness. Of something hovering just beyond my vision.

Watching.

Waiting.

Then, as suddenly as it came. Itvanished.

The weight lifted. I sucked in a ragged breath, my chest burning, my body jerking forward as if breaking free from invisible chains.

Whether you’re into streaming, shopping, or just trying to save some cash, these hacks are perfect for Indian teens (and anyone else who loves a good deal!).

1. 🆓 Free Trials: Try Before You Pay

\- Many apps like Netflix, Hotstar, or Spotify offer free trials. Use them to binge your favorite shows or listen to music, but cancel before the trial ends\*\* to avoid getting charged.

\- Example: Hotstar gives you a free trial for new users. Watch IPL for free, then cancel before they charge you!

2. 🎮 The Cancellation Game: Get Discounts

\- If you try to cancel a subscription, companies might offer you a discount to stay.

\- Example: Spotify might drop your Premium plan from ₹199/month to ₹99/month for 3 months if you try to cancel.

3. 🛒 Subscribe and Save: Discounts on Regular Deliveries

\- Platforms like Amazon India or BigBasket offer discounts if you subscribe to regular deliveries of items like toilet paper, Maggi, or handwash.

\- Example: Get 10% off on Dettol Handwash if you subscribe to monthly deliveries.

4. 🚫 Don’t Commit: Cancel After One Purchase

\- Sign up for a subscription to get a discount on your first order, then cancel it right away.

\- Example: Subscribe to a coffee brand on Amazon, get a discount on your first order, then cancel the subscription.

5. 🔍 Can You Get It Cheaper? Look for Deals

\- Always check if there’s a cheaper way to get the same service.

\- \*\*Example: Airtel users get free access to Amazon Prime Video or Netflix as part of their mobile plan.

6. 🔄 Rotate Subscriptions: Only Pay for What You Use

\- Instead of paying for multiple subscriptions at once, only pay for the one you’re using that month.

\- Example: Use Hotstar during IPL season, then switch to Netflix for movies later.

7. 👥 Share Subscriptions: Split the Cost

\- Share one subscription with family or friends instead of everyone paying separately.

\- Example: Share a Spotify Premium account with your sibling and split the ₹199/month cost.

8. 💳 Pay Annually: Save Money in the Long Run

\- Paying for a whole year at once is usually cheaper than paying monthly.

\-Example: Hotstar yearly plans are often cheaper than monthly ones.

9. 🔄 Change the Account Holder: Get New Customer Deals

\- Companies give better deals to new customers. Cancel your subscription and sign up again using someone else’s name.

\- Example: Cancel your Amazon Prime subscription and sign up again using your mom’s email to get a discount.

10. 🤝 Use Platforms to Share Subscriptions

\- If you live alone, use websites like \*\*Sharesub.com\*\* to share subscriptions with strangers and split the cost.

\-Example: Share a Netflix account with someone else and split the ₹649/month cost.

Pro Tip:

Always set a reminder to cancel free trials or subscriptions before they charge you. Don’t let your hard-earned money go to waste!

Whether you’re into streaming, shopping, or just trying to save some cash, these hacks are perfect for Indian teens (and anyone else who loves a good deal!).

1. 🆓 Free Trials: Try Before You Pay

\- Many apps like Netflix, Hotstar, or Spotify offer free trials. Use them to binge your favorite shows or listen to music, but cancel before the trial ends\*\* to avoid getting charged.

\- Example: Hotstar gives you a free trial for new users. Watch IPL for free, then cancel before they charge you!

2. 🎮 The Cancellation Game: Get Discounts

\- If you try to cancel a subscription, companies might offer you a discount to stay.

\- Example: Spotify might drop your Premium plan from ₹199/month to ₹99/month for 3 months if you try to cancel.

3. 🛒 Subscribe and Save: Discounts on Regular Deliveries

\- Platforms like Amazon India or BigBasket offer discounts if you subscribe to regular deliveries of items like toilet paper, Maggi, or handwash.

\- Example: Get 10% off on Dettol Handwash if you subscribe to monthly deliveries.

4. 🚫 Don’t Commit: Cancel After One Purchase

\- Sign up for a subscription to get a discount on your first order, then cancel it right away.

\- Example: Subscribe to a coffee brand on Amazon, get a discount on your first order, then cancel the subscription.

5. 🔍 Can You Get It Cheaper? Look for Deals

\- Always check if there’s a cheaper way to get the same service.

\- \*\*Example: Airtel users get free access to Amazon Prime Video or Netflix as part of their mobile plan.

6. 🔄 Rotate Subscriptions: Only Pay for What You Use

\- Instead of paying for multiple subscriptions at once, only pay for the one you’re using that month.

\- Example: Use Hotstar during IPL season, then switch to Netflix for movies later.

7. 👥 Share Subscriptions: Split the Cost

\- Share one subscription with family or friends instead of everyone paying separately.

\- Example: Share a Spotify Premium account with your sibling and split the ₹199/month cost.

8. 💳 Pay Annually: Save Money in the Long Run

\- Paying for a whole year at once is usually cheaper than paying monthly.

\-Example: Hotstar yearly plans are often cheaper than monthly ones.

9. 🔄 Change the Account Holder: Get New Customer Deals

\- Companies give better deals to new customers. Cancel your subscription and sign up again using someone else’s name.

\- Example: Cancel your Amazon Prime subscription and sign up again using your mom’s email to get a discount.

10. 🤝 Use Platforms to Share Subscriptions

\- If you live alone, use websites like \*\*Sharesub.com\*\* to share subscriptions with strangers and split the cost.

\-Example: Share a Netflix account with someone else and split the ₹649/month cost.

The breakup itself wasn't even harsch, we never had a fight, just long distance and feelings faded from her side. We stayed online friends because there was always a potential to get back together once we we lived close to each other again.

That was until she found someone else and texted me she thinks too much happened between us to remain friends, I agreed. 

That was the moment I asked to have a final phonecall, a story of some sort, to conclude, for a nice goodbye. She ignored the request.

I must have been an idiot for confronting her with that 3 months later, so like 9 months ago. Initially she wasnt amused, but then gave me an apology that it was not nice of her to not respond, she thought my request for a phonecall was not too much to ask for, but emotionally she couldnt do it. When I asked why, she said something was and still is blocking her, but she doesn't understand why. When I asked how she was doing, she said she felt shitty but didn't want to talk about it, so I left it there.

I think it was very sweet she tried to explain, and I now knew I had to get closure by myself. But there is still this voice in my head saying this girl was done with me and was able to say 'goodbye within 1 text,' just like that, while I was not even worthy of a phonecall. Its an internal fight in my brain, and I just do not understand why it bothers me so much.

I don't even think she would have been a good long term partner for me by how avoidant she is. So why cant I just move on?

With previous women I dated I always ended up drinking a coffee or have some chat on the phone before saying goodbye and then I just moved on...

The whole country of the USA was already comparable to a mental asylum, but now with the big European cities becoming more and more like American cities we can also see how it has changed the situation in Europe: every city has the same stores, same brands, same coffee shop slop, same people that all look the same anywhere you go in Europe.

It is a shame that it has happened, but it is what is. What I just can find to accept is the horrific amount of psychopaths, living their own illusion, working top tier jobs but not doing anything productive over there, women with the only goal of walking around a city and slurping coffee as if they were models on a catwalk, straight up evil people having children and relationships as if nothing is going on while the average Joe (as an American would say) is struggling massively to find a job, having a relationship and will never be able to buy a house because of the American system of capitalism completely ruining European cities that once used to be social.

Most people in big western cities seem to be evil. Only caring about their own appearance and the appearance of others, being extremely shallow, expats outcompeting the average dutchmen to ever being able to even live in their own capital. European countries seem nothing more than american satellite states with no identity and empty people walking around.

It was her decision based on a few different issues in the relationship which I fully understand and agree with. I was struggling with my mental health for a long time having come off my anti-depressants. I was incredibly difficult to be around, and kind of went into self-defence mode to protect myself, cutting her out a bit in the process. There were also some sexual issues around not having sex enough and me not being that interested in it at all.

The day we broke up, we agreed (after she asked me not to cut her out of my life completely) that we’d reconnect after 1.5 months or so). I’ve spent that time working on everything she brought up. I had therapy for the sexual issues, I’m back on anti-depressants, I’ve been doing a lot of activities and getting out, and I’ve also taken more of an interest in the people around me and their lives.

I reached out to her about meeting for a coffee, and she was really nice at first. We had a chat over WhatsApp and I told her I’d moved back to where we live having moved home for a while when I was between jobs. A few days later, I asked her what day would best work for her, and she suddenly became very cold with me and it seems she’s now delaying seeing me. I know this is probably because she’s living a different life and probably having a lot of fun, but it’s brought up a lot of different emotions in me.

Up until now, I definitely still wanted the relationship to work and desperately wanted her back. As time has gone by, I now flip flop between still wanting her back and thinking that maybe this is the best thing for both of us and that it didn’t work anymore. I still love her, but maybe there is something better out there for both of us. I’m very confused, and it’s kinda screwing me up.

1jhwka4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingStrangeness/comments/1jhwka4/one_night_at_the_society_of_liars/,One Night at the Society of Liars,"You know, in this day and age, everything has its own society, community, or forum—whether offline or online. Even the strange and nonsensical ones.

Have you ever heard about a bunch of kids taking pictures with DSLR lens caps? Yeah, very specific—the lens caps. That falls into the ""doesn't-make-sense"" category for me, and yet, it has its own societies and communities in different cities.

Welcome to millennial! Yay!

Now, if you think about it, it wouldn't be odd to find that almost everything else has its own society, community, or forum.

Take liars, for example.

Yeah, liars—people who tell lies. They have their own society too. I mean, why not? Especially when you're in the habit of lying, constantly telling lies, and want a safe space to do it without hurting your family or loved ones. It’s much easier to lie to a group of people who already know you’re lying than to deceive the people who truly matter to you.

I was once a part of this Society of Liars.

Once.

Like any other society, the Society of Liars I’m talking about had a name. It was called Liar’s Dinner, because it was held once a week at night, where we shared lies over dinner and snacks. Pretty much like any other gathering, except for one key rule: everything we said was a lie. Every single thing.

And all the members of the gathering must react and respond as if the story is real, no matter how badly the lies are told by other members.

There are many reasons why people tell lies.

The most common is to avoid trouble—truth gets you into trouble, so you lie. Others lie because they’re manipulators; they enjoy controlling situations and people. But the most fascinating liars, in my opinion, are the dreamers—the ones who wish they could do something they never could, so they lie about it. They lie about being great at something, just to feel the thrill of admiration. It gives them the same satisfaction as a successful person bragging about their achievements.

The difference is, it’s all a lie.

When people believe them, they feel like their worth skyrockets—like they’ve ascended to a higher level of respect or quality.

But in reality, they haven’t.

As seasoned liars, most of us could spot the difference between truth and lies, no matter how well-disguised. Some lies are obvious, even to a child.

Take Danny Allman, for example—a short, chubby, awkward guy and a terrible liar. His lies were so bad, they were almost entertaining. He’d spin the same stories over and over, about robbing banks or hooking up with supermodels. You didn’t need a Ph.D. in psychology to know he was lying.

Then there are lies that only experts can debunk. Like if someone claims to have robbed a bank but gets the details wrong, someone with experience would catch it immediately.

A lie is a lie—it didn’t happen. And if you’ve lived with lies long enough, you can always tell the difference.

But have I ever met someone who told a lie so convincing that it sounded like the truth? A story where every detail matched, down to the tiniest nuance?

Yes, I have.

Do I think they were lying or telling the truth?

Well, you tell me.

It was the 57th Liar’s Dinner gathering. Only seven out of 24 members showed up—it was a cold and rainy night.

One of the Society of Liars’ core rules was anonymity. No one knew anyone’s real identity. We all used fake names, and no personal details were shared when we joined. The only things we knew about each other were our faces, fake names, and the lies we told.

My name in the society was Lucas Dwell—Luke for short.

I ran from the parking lot to the building to avoid the rain, knocked on the door, and was greeted by Max.

“Yo, Luke! Our Liar of the Month is here!” Max exclaimed, grinning. “How’s your day, mate?”

“Terrible, as always. Everything went horribly wrong today,” I replied, stepping inside. In the Liar’s Dinner, the moment you entered the room, everything you said had to be a lie.

“Wow, that’s sad,” Max said with a chuckle, handing me a cup of warm coffee.

The others—Danny, Lionel, Neil, and Randall—were already there. Shortly after, Nicholas arrived, making it seven of us.

Max started the meeting, and we all took turns telling our lies. Danny kicked things off with his usual nonsense—crime sprees and supermodels. Predictable. Lionel tried something new, claiming he’d hooked up with a famous actress. Close, but the details didn’t quite add up. Neil and Randall teamed up, boasting about launching a startup that became wildly successful in just three months. Too good to be true.

Finally, it was Nicholas’ turn. Usually, he’d launch straight into tales of glamour and luxury. But that night was different.

He sat there, scanning the room, a strange smile on his face.

“Well,” he began, “this week, I experienced something I’ve never experienced before. Something extreme.”

He paused, letting the silence build.

“I murdered someone.”

The room fell silent, everyone staring at him in disbelief.

Throughout 57 meetups with 24 members, no one ever told a story—or a lie—about murdering someone. Some members did share stories about doing horrible things to people they hated, like their bosses or their bullies, but never a murder.

""Wow! This is new!"" Max exclaimed from the back, as excited as ever, clapping his hands slowly. ""Go on!""

""It actually happened three days ago,"" Nicky began his story. ""The day started out like every other day. I woke up in the morning, had breakfast, and kissed my wife goodbye before heading to work."" Unlike the way he had opened his session earlier, his voice softened as he started his story.

""So, I did my job as best as I could at the office, just like I always do. However, unlike every other day, it turned out to be the worst day ever. That morning, I had a meeting with a potential investor for the company I work for. I’ve never had a problem dealing with third parties before—whether they were future clients or investors—but this one guy I met that morning was really tough. He asked me questions, and I answered, but no matter what I said, he always had a counterargument. It was as if everything I said was wrong.

""You know, it wasn’t the first time I talked to potential investors. I’ve been doing this for years. Most of the questions they ask are predictable, and I know the answers by heart. So, I started to think that this guy was intentionally giving me a hard time.

""And I didn’t know why.

""Long story short, the deal fell through. It was a complete failure. My boss had warned me beforehand that this deal was huge, so if I failed, I’d be in trouble.

""And I was.

""When I got back to the office, I had to endure the full wrath of my boss. My day was officially ruined. And it didn’t stop there—it got worse. Just as my boss was done yelling at me, he reminded me of another meeting in the afternoon. That’s when I realized I’d forgotten to bring the files he needed for the meeting.

""I couldn’t afford more trouble, so I sneaked out of the office and drove home. My plan was simple: grab the files and get back before my boss noticed I was gone.

""But when I got home, I heard noises coming from my bedroom. It was my wife, moaning with pleasure. I walked toward the doorway. It wasn’t closed, so I could see everything clearly—my wife in the middle of having sex with another man.

""I didn’t know who he was because, from the doorway, I only saw his back.

""Of course, I did what any husband would do in that situation. I shoved the door open and yelled at them. I startled the guy because he quickly turned around.

""That’s when my rage boiled over.

""I finally saw the man’s face, and at first, I thought he was a stranger. But I was wrong. I had met him before—just that morning during the investor meeting.

""The man in bed with my wife was the same man who had sabotaged the deal earlier that day. The potential investor.

""'WHAT THE FUCK? WHY ARE YOU HERE, HUH?' I shouted at him as he scrambled to get off the bed. 'You ruined the deal this morning, got me in trouble with my boss, and now you’re screwing my wife? You son of a bitch!'

""'Soon-to-be-ex-wife!' he shot back. 'Stop acting like you're so great! You're good at nothing!'

""'You’re in my house, goddammit!' I screamed, enraged. 'Don’t act like you own the place!' I ran at him and swung my fist.

""Before I knew it, we were fighting. My wife just sat on the bed, frozen, unsure of what to do.

""During the fight, I managed to grab something from the desk—a metallic statue—and I swung it at him. BAM! I hit his head hard. Blood gushed out, and he collapsed. He wasn’t moving. My wife screamed in horror at the sight.

""My house is pretty big, and the distance between houses in my neighborhood is considerable, so no one would have heard us yelling. But my wife’s scream? That would definitely alert the neighbors. Before she could scream again, I turned around and hurled the metallic statue at her.

""I didn’t aim for her head, but that’s where it landed. She suffered the same fate as her lover—dead from massive blood loss.

""I knew I couldn’t afford to get caught, so I thought fast.

""First, I had to avoid arousing suspicion at work or among my neighbors. I locked the house and rushed back to the office.

""I wrapped up everything I needed to do at work and then returned home in the evening. Once home, I cleaned up the mess. I burned all the clothes and fabrics stained with blood. I scrubbed every trace of blood from the floor and walls. Then, I mutilated their bodies, packed them into a large bag, and waited until after midnight.

""When the neighborhood was silent, I loaded the bag into my car and drove to my late grandparents’ old house on the outskirts of town. Behind their house, there’s a pier that leads to a deep, murky lake. I found the biggest drum in their barn, stuffed the bodies inside, and sealed it with cement.

""Finally, I rolled the drum onto the pier and let it plunge into the lake’s depths.

""I returned home by 4 a.m., just before the neighborhood woke up. Exhausted, I collapsed onto my freshly cleaned bed and fell asleep almost immediately.""

Nicky paused, taking a deep breath, and looked around the room at each of us.

""Well, that’s all,"" he said, spreading his arms wide and smiling ear to ear.

No one reacted. The room was silent. We all sat there, staring at Nicky, each of us silently asking the same question.

This was Liars’ Dinner, a gathering where everyone shared lies. Nicky’s story, like everyone else’s, should have been a lie. But when I glanced at the other members, their faces told me they were thinking the same thing as I was.

Nicky’s story sounded too realistic. Way too realistic. Every detail seemed perfectly placed.

I’d known Nicky since the society's inception. I’d heard every lie he’d ever told, and there were always flaws—details that didn’t add up. But not this time.

I mean, this was a murder, man! A murder! You don’t just make something like that up without cracks in the story. It’s too big, too haunting to be flawless.

Before anyone could react, Nicky stood up, glanced at his watch, and said, ""I’m deeply sorry, guys. It’s been fun, but I have to go now."" He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

""What? Right now? Come on, Nicky, we're not done yet,"" Max tried to keep him in the room.

""Sorry, Max. There's a plane I need to catch,"" Nicky replied.

""A plane? Where are you going?"" Leo asked.

""Manila, Philippines,"" Nicky responded calmly. ""Business trip, for about two weeks. I won’t see you guys for two weeks. Gotta say, that's pretty sad."" Nicky giggled as he explained.

Nicky walked toward the door, with Max following behind.

""See ya, guys,"" he waved at us in the room without even looking back.

Max closed the door and locked it. He then turned around and leaned his back against the door. Everyone in the room remained silent as Max stared at each of us.

""The story Nicky just told us,"" Max spoke slowly, his voice soft, ""was a lie..."" He paused for a moment before continuing with a question.

""...Right?""

Everyone in the room exchanged uneasy glances.

""Well, this is a Liars' society. Rule number one is that everything we say in the room should be a lie,"" Neil answered. But before he could finish, Max cut him off.

""I wasn't asking about the society or the rules,"" Max said. ""I was asking your opinion about Nicky's story.""

""I don’t know, Max. Seriously. I'm not a good liar,"" Randy said. ""But Nicky's story was too convincing. I felt like I was drawn to it.""

""Okay, this is breaking the rules we set for ourselves,"" Danny finally spoke. ""We’re not supposed to discuss whether the other members' stories are truth or lies.""

""Yeah, but we’ve never heard a lie this good in the society before. And it’s Nicky we’re talking about. Even I always noticed some details that were off in his stories,"" Randy commented. ""Also, we all agreed that there’s no such thing as a perfect liar.""

""Well, yeah. But rules are rules, Randy,"" Danny replied.

""Okay, okay. Danny’s right,"" Max said again. ""But one more question..."" He remained leaning on the door.

""Who else here thinks that Nicky isn’t actually coming back?""

No one raised their hand, but from the looks in their eyes, I was sure everyone had the same answer to that question. And for the next thirty minutes, we sat in silence, each lost in our thoughts, pondering the thing we weren’t supposed to discuss.

After the rain and wind stopped, one by one, everyone got up from their seats and walked toward the door. We left without saying a word, but we all had the same thoughts lingering in our minds.

Two days after the gathering, I stopped by a coffee shop near my house after work. Just as I was about to pull out a chair, I heard a familiar voice.

""Lucas Dwell,"" the voice said slowly, ""or whatever your real name is.""

I turned to see Maxwell Duncan—if that was even his real name—sitting at a table next to the one I was about to sit at. Max gestured for me to join him, so I sat across from him.

After a few moments of silence, I couldn’t hold back anymore.

""Okay. This isn’t the society’s room, so I can ask whatever I want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice low. ""Nicky's story was a lie, right?""

""I don’t know, but..."" Max replied immediately, ""what if we ask the question differently?""

""Say he actually killed his wife and her lover,"" Max began. ""Why would he tell us about it? All of us. Six people. We could be witnesses to his confession.""

Max had a point, and I was about to agree when another thought flashed through my mind.

""You know, if he wasn’t a serial killer and only killed them unintentionally, wouldn’t the murder haunt him? I read a few articles about that,"" I said.

""Yeah, I know. So?"" Max responded.

""So, the only way to ease the burden and haunting thoughts is by sharing the story with someone,"" I explained.

""Typically a friend or a psychiatrist, sure. But six people? That doesn’t make sense,"" Max said.

""Exactly. But think about this—have you seen any news about murders matching Nicky’s story?"" I asked. Max froze for a moment before responding.

""I haven’t,"" he admitted. ""I’ve been looking but found nothing.""

""Exactly. And don’t forget he shared the story in the Society of Liars, where everything is supposed to be a lie,"" I continued. ""That’s the rule, but who’s to say some parts weren’t true? Maybe he just added twists and changes to make it seem like a lie.""

""No one can prove if Nicky even has a wife or a job,"" Max added, his excitement growing.

""Or a house,"" I said.

""Maybe..."" I said, ""maybe he did murder someone. Or two. Or three. Who knows?"" I paused. ""But it’s clearly not his wife and her lover.""

""It’s possible he mutilated someone, packed them in a drum, but didn’t throw them into his grandparents’ lake,"" Max suggested. ""Maybe he dumped them in the sea. Or burned them.""

""That’s smart,"" Max said, leaning back in his chair. ""Even if we watched the news, we’d never figure it out.""

""Because we don’t know which parts were true and which were lies,"" I added.

""You think everyone else has figured this out too?"" Max asked.

""Even if they haven’t yet, they eventually will,"" I replied. ""If we can, so can they. And the six of us from that night can tell the story to others who weren’t there.""

""Will it impact the society?"" I asked.

Max stared at the ceiling for a moment before answering. ""Yes,"" he said. ""And the worst-case scenario..."" He paused. ""Everyone might find the game useful and start using it themselves.""

""You mean the other members might murder someone they hate and retell their stories to ease their burden too?"" I asked, not even surprised anymore.

""Yep. And that, Luke,"" Max said, pointing at himself, ""includes me...""

Then he pointed his finger at me.

""...And you.""",1,1742726844.0,VisitingStrangeness,0,1.0,False
1jhwk95,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1jhwk95/treating_ibs_made_me_85_better/,"Treating ""IBS"" made me 85% better","I wanted to post my story to help anyone who suffered from GI issues like I did.

So basically, I have been dealing with gerd for 8 years now. From year 1 to 2 it was only GERD, then it turned into GERD + IBS.

Or at least, what I was told was IBS-D.
A new GI doc asked me to do a abdomen radiography, I came to see him with the results and he told me: ""you actually have chronic constipation, look how much fesces are stuck along you colon"". 
Believe me I was shocked. Like wtf? I poop every day, some days 8 times. How can I be constipated?
He calls this ""fake diarhea"". Basically, the more liquidy stuff travel through the dry poop and because your GI track is so full, you get the usual symptoms of IBS-D (pain, irritability, urgency to go to the bathroom...).

Anyway the treatment was: a laxative cleanse (the one they use before a colonoscopy), and then some dietary changes (really high quantity of dietary fibers everyday, especially psyllium).
This amount of fiber, believe me, make you bloat a lot at first. But for me it was only 4 days of pain, and then... 80% better in terms of my ""ibs"" symptoms, and surprisingly no more GERD (except some remaining trigger food being butter, coffee and chocolate, but it seems to improve overtime for butter).

I used to take PPI every day, and gaviscon occasionnally. When I stopped PPIs before I started my fiber intake, I would take gaviscon 4 times a week, and would manage my symptoms avoiding coffee, alcohol and processed food. Now I take gaviscon once every 2 weeks when I drink too much coffee.

Many users stumble upon the same pitfalls that can really dampen their experience. Let’s dive into some common blunders and how you can sidestep them for a smoother ride!

First off, one major mistake is being vague with your prompts. If you’re not specific, you might end up with responses that don’t quite hit the mark. Think of it like ordering a coffee; if you just say “coffee,” you might get a brew that’s not to your taste. Instead, try to include details about what you want.

Another frequent misstep is overlooking the context. If you jump from topic to topic without providing background, ChatGPT might struggle to keep up. It’s like having a conversation with someone who missed the first half of the story.

Don’t forget about the importance of patience! Sometimes, users expect immediate, perfect answers. Remember, it’s okay to refine your questions or ask for clarifications. It’s a conversation, not a test.

Also, keep in mind that while ChatGPT is powerful, it’s not infallible. It can sometimes generate incorrect or misleading information. Always double-check anything that seems off, especially if it’s crucial.

Finally, be mindful of tone. If you’re looking for something casual, make sure your prompt reflects that. The right tone can make a world of difference in the responses you get.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you’ll not only enhance your experience but also unlock the full potential of ChatGPT. Happy chatting!",1,1742726780.0,hacksguider,0,1.0,False

Recently, during computer science’s class we had a five minute break and this guy in my class spent his time going through the school’s website -to the photo gallery just to zoom into pictures of me where I was making faces. And I didn’t like this since the guy in my class that I’ve just mentioned, constantly bullies and makes fun of my appearance. Even if I try to ignore it, he’ll just rub it all over my face and talk about it with his friends. At first I didn’t care but he had the audacity to walk up to one of my friend, claiming he wanted to “show her something” then again, went on the school’s website photo gallery just to pick out the same picture and zoom in like he did with his own computers. 

I know this was wrong of me to say this but I felt so mad and furious because this guy always makes it obvious he have a problem with me. We used to talk and ever since a small fling happened, he turned it upside down and make it a big deal but I don’t want to go into details about that. Quickly, after class ended, I immediately rushed to our classroom and poured coffee all over his class work papers. I turned it upside down so that he won’t see the stains but allow the a little coffee spills to still be seen. While everyone was waiting for our geo teacher, I went back in class and sprinkled some more out of anger-hoping he’d see it. But he’s not the type of kid to care about his studies enough to really know what’s really happening on his desk. An hour passed and he still didn’t noticed it since he was busy talking with others. It was only then until class ended, he rushed out without checking and on my way home I felt a bit worried that he’d complain to the office. I know it’s my fault and I’d be in big trouble for it. I did it out of anger because he had spewed a lot of bs about my problems while making fun of my looks-telling me to cry about it. I know I’m sensitive but I can differentiate between a joke and disrespect and we both are no longer friends. To him, multiple times he had told me that I should’ve just die or tell me to do everyone a favor and kill myself. 

Should I clean up the mess when I get back to school and pretended like nothing had happened or let it sit there? 

It’s been there for almost two days and school is tmr, I’m sure there will be a foul smell. 
Please let me know your thoughts. I know I’m stupid for this :(

Coffee lovers know the difference a good cup can make. The right amount of coffee grounds is key to that delicious taste. Measuring can seem tricky, but it’s simple once you know the basics. Using the right amount of coffee ensures a balanced flavor.

Too much, and it’s bitter; too little, and it’s weak. Today, we’ll explore the ideal coffee-to-water ratio to help you make the best cup every time. Let’s dive into the details and perfect your coffee-making skills.

# Measurement Basics

Making a great cup of coffee starts with understanding the basics of measurement. Knowing how many tablespoons per cup of coffee is crucial for achieving the perfect brew. The right balance of coffee and water can make or break your morning ritual. Let’s dive into the measurement basics to help you brew a consistently delicious cup of coffee every time.

# Common Conversions

Understanding common conversions is essential for brewing coffee. The standard coffee-to-water ratio is often measured in tablespoons per cup. Here are some basic guidelines:

* **1 cup of coffee:** 8 ounces of water
* **1 tablespoon of coffee:** 0.5 ounces of coffee

For an average strength coffee, you typically use:

* **1 cup (8 oz) of water:** 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee

For those who prefer a stronger brew:

* **1 cup (8 oz) of water:** 2-3 tablespoons of ground coffee

Here is a quick reference table for common conversions:

|Cups of Coffee|Tablespoons of Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|1 cup|1-2 tablespoons|
|2 cups|2-4 tablespoons|
|4 cups|4-8 tablespoons|

# Importance Of Precision

Precision in coffee measurement is vital. Using too much or too little coffee can affect the taste. A well-measured cup ensures consistency. Every time.

Here are some tips for achieving precision:

1. **Use a coffee scoop:** A dedicated coffee scoop ensures you use the right amount.
2. **Invest in a kitchen scale:** Weighing your coffee can provide more accuracy than using tablespoons.

For those who take their coffee seriously, a digital scale is a worthy investment. It allows you to measure your coffee to the gram. This level of precision can make a noticeable difference.

Using the correct water-to-coffee ratio is equally important. Too much water dilutes the coffee. Too little water makes it too strong. Always stick to the recommended ratios for the best results.

Remember, the quality of your coffee matters too. Freshly ground coffee provides a richer flavor. Store your coffee beans properly to maintain freshness. Precision in measurement combined with fresh coffee equals a perfect cup every time.

# Tablespoon To Cup Ratio

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee can be an art. One crucial factor is the tablespoon to cup ratio. Understanding how many tablespoons per cup of coffee ensures a well-balanced flavor. This guide will help clarify the standard measurements and how different coffee types might require variations in the ratio.

# Standard Measurements

For most coffee enthusiasts, a common question is how many tablespoons of coffee are needed per cup. The standard measurement is:

* **1 cup of coffee** (8 fluid ounces) requires **2 tablespoons** of coffee grounds.

This ratio is widely accepted for a balanced and enjoyable flavor. To make it easier to remember:

|Number of Cups|Tablespoons of Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|1 cup (8 oz)|2 tablespoons|
|2 cups (16 oz)|4 tablespoons|
|4 cups (32 oz)|8 tablespoons|

For those who prefer stronger coffee, you can use 2.5 tablespoons per cup. This will provide a richer taste without being overly bitter. Remember, precise measurement ensures a consistent coffee experience every time.

# Variations In Coffee Types

Different coffee types might require adjustments to the standard tablespoon to cup ratio. Here are a few examples:

* **Espresso:** Typically, 1.5 tablespoons per 2-ounce shot.
* **French Press:** 1 cup of water (8 oz) to 1 heaping tablespoon of coffee.
* **Cold Brew:** For a stronger concentrate, use 1 cup of coffee grounds to 4 cups of water.

Espresso requires a finer grind and a stronger ratio. A heaping tablespoon in a French Press allows for the longer steeping time. Cold Brew, needing a larger amount of coffee, results in a concentrated brew that is diluted before drinking.

Understanding these variations helps in customizing your coffee experience. Adjust the ratio based on the brewing method and your taste preference. Enjoy experimenting with these measurements to find what suits your palate best.

# Brewing Techniques

Introduction paragraph about How Many Tablespoons Per Cup of Coffee and Brewing Techniques…

# French Press Methods

Making coffee with a French press is simple, yet it requires precision. The correct amount of coffee grounds is crucial. Generally, use **1 tablespoon of coffee per 4 ounces of water**. For a standard 8-cup French press, you will need 8 tablespoons of coffee.

Here is a quick guide:

* 1 cup (4 oz) of water: 1 tablespoon of coffee
* 2 cups (8 oz) of water: 2 tablespoons of coffee
* 4 cups (16 oz) of water: 4 tablespoons of coffee
* 8 cups (32 oz) of water: 8 tablespoons of coffee

Steps to make French press coffee:

1. Boil water and let it cool for a minute.
2. Add coffee grounds to the French press.
3. Pour in the water.
4. Stir the mixture.
5. Place the lid on, but do not press the plunger down yet.
6. Let it steep for 4 minutes.
7. Press the plunger down slowly.

Following these steps ensures a rich, full-bodied coffee experience. Adjust the amount of coffee to your taste preference.

# Drip Coffee Brewing

Drip coffee makers are popular for their convenience. The standard ratio is **2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water**. This ratio can be adjusted depending on the strength you prefer.

Here is a helpful table:

|Water (oz)|Coffee (tablespoons)|
|:-|:-|
|6|2|
|12|4|
|24|8|
|48|16|

Steps to brew coffee with a drip coffee maker:

1. Fill the water reservoir with the desired amount of water.
2. Place a coffee filter in the basket.
3. Add the correct amount of coffee grounds to the filter.
4. Turn on the coffee maker.
5. Wait for the brewing cycle to complete.

Drip coffee makers can vary, so always check the manufacturer’s instructions. Adjust the coffee amount to suit your taste.

# Taste Profiles

When brewing coffee, the number of tablespoons per cup plays a crucial role in determining the taste profile. The taste of your coffee can vary greatly depending on the strength and balance of flavors. Understanding how to adjust these factors will help you create the perfect cup.

# Adjusting For Strength

Adjusting the strength of your coffee is essential for achieving your preferred taste. The general guideline is to use 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. This can be adjusted based on personal preference.

I am eager to connect with a like-minded woman who is interested in cultivating a sincere friendship, which may also evolve into a Friends with Benefits arrangement that includes additional perks.

To share a bit about myself: I am a well-educated, well-traveled, and mature professional who values engaging conversations, new experiences, and the finer aspects of life. I seek more than a mere fleeting interaction; I desire someone who values meaningful connections—whether as a friend, confidante, or partner.

I am not interested in brief, purely transactional encounters. Instead, I would prefer to meet for coffee or lunch, allowing us to get to know one another and assess our chemistry. If we connect well, we can explore an arrangement that is mutually beneficial.

That done we decided it was time to actually go on a lake in the lake district - never been on one before

The boat took us down to Bowness, and we had a stoat about and some lunch. Also managed a shite spot of a very cool old Landrover

We returned to Ambleside and picked up the Zoe.

Sat nag said 155 miles to home. Range guessometer said 183miles.

 
I decided to be brave!

Got home without charging - stuck to 60mph on the M6/M74 - fast enough to stay out the way of the trucks but slow enough to get decent economy.

Got home with 41miles/19% remaining.

On that consumption it'd have done the whole trip with 1 full charge worth whilst on the journey

First charge £0.59 23kw £13.57
Second charger £0.42 25kw £10.50
Home charging £0.24 37.5kw £9
Total 85.5kwh £33.07 (10.4p/mile)

So about 4p/mile cheaper than the Octavia I had previously, and that's with public charging.

It seems pretty useable as a distance car (as long as you ain't in a rush)

The junta isn't accepting my rental contract, as my NIF is tied to my home country (I will change this after my residence card comes in.)
