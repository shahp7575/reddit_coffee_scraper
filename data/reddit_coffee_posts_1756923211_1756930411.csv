Not time management?,"I’m a startup founder and I’ve been in the scene for almost four years now. One thing I keep struggling with is productivity. Most days, I feel useful until around 2pm, and after that, it’s like I hit a wall. 

I try to push through with coffee or by forcing myself to grind, but the quality drops, and by the evening, I’m drained and questioning if I even worked smart that day. It’s frustrating because I know I’m putting in the hours, but the results don’t always match the effort.

After burning out a few times, I started paying closer attention to what was actually happening. I realized that time wasn’t the issue at all, it was energy. 

I could manage my calendar down to the minute, but if my energy was gone, I was just staring at the screen, getting nothing meaningful done. That’s when I started experimenting with a different approach, something I now call the “Energy Management Cycle.”

The idea is simple: instead of seeing the day as a long to-do list, I treat it like an energy rhythm. First, I try to build awareness of how I’m feeling throughout the day sharp in the morning, sluggish after lunch, maybe a little rebound in the evening. 

Once I noticed these patterns, I started matching my work to them. For example, I use my high-energy mornings for problem-solving, deep thinking, or creative work. Then when I’m in a low-energy window, I shift to easy, routine tasks like emails or admin work.

Another part I’ve found crucial is recovery. Before, I would just grind until I hit a crash, but now I force myself to take small resets before that happens. Even five minutes of stretching, a short walk, or just drinking water helps me get back on track. 

At the end of the week, I reflect a little: what drained me, what boosted me, and how I can adjust the next week. It’s not perfect, but it’s been keeping me more steady and less burnt out.

What I like about this is that it’s simple enough to remember without any fancy tools, and it works no matter what kind of work you do. The more I practice it, the more natural it feels. If you want to try it, it’s as basic as checking in on your energy a few times a day, matching your work to how you feel, and taking quick breaks before you crash.

To be honest, I still forget to do this consistently, which is why I created energy performance framework to help me. It’s something that gives me little nudges like reminding me to check my energy, suggesting when to rest, and showing patterns over time so I can improve. But you don’t need an app to start. Try working by energy instead of just time for a week and see how it feels.

For me, this shift has been eye-opening. Managing time alone wasn’t enough. Once I started managing my energy, I noticed I could get more meaningful work done without feeling completely wiped out by the end of the day.",1,1756930060.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

We deserve proper randomised research. Putting out pishy observational research is not good enough for something as important as the only recommended painkillers. This isn't something like coffee or cheese where it's just a nice to have. Taking away the one painkiller we had access to is devastating to me and I imagine many other who are managing complex pregnancies. 

I understand that there are ethical difficulties in doing randomised trials in pregnancy but, given that the use of the drug is widespread and currently recommended, an advise based randomisation (which has been done for other things in pregnancy like coffee and alcohol) should be feasible and I think it is actually really cruel and irresponsible to have made recommendations to avoid painkillers on such poor evidence without putting in the effort to actually do the studies needed to validate the position. I wish the researchers had just shut the fuck up till they knew what they were actually talking about rather than make people like me scared and unsure leaving us in pain cause they couldn't be arsed to design a proper study.

TW: >!Swearing/foul language!<

***Date: Thursday, August 28th, 2040***

***Time: 10:05 P.M. PDT***

***Location: Atlas's Main Camp, Bay Area***

Nearly a month after the crushing defeat at New London, the troops were still reeling. They had magic, they had portals, they had a network of war camps spiderwebbing across the continent like cracked glass. So what went wrong? 

Daulat had evaded capture, had tried to bring as many wounded soldiers back to the main war camp for healing, had taken inventory of the amount of supplies lost to the destruction of New London. Their numbers were much lower now in both soldiers and supplies, and morale seemed to land somewhere between muted and tense. Everyone was on edge, and nobody talked about the battle. Occasionally, a curious newbie soldier being treated at the main medic tent would have a question held in their gaze, but Daulat would quickly interject with a question about injury or treatment with his sunshiny disposition, attempting to steer away from the subject. 

Those who knew, knew. And the other soldiers had a right to know. But hushed conversation is cheap, and would only add to the simmering atmosphere. 

So when Daulat saw the job to recruit a drakon across the country, he jumped on the opportunity. He couldn’t take all the whining and the bellyaching, the complaining without anyone actually getting anything done. He has a right to complain, but more importantly, he was actually going to do something to make the situation better, to enrich their ranks, and bolster the ledger of their forces. 

Daulat reported to command for the job, where he was given a briefing on the task at hand and the time sensitivity of it. A Drakon was residing in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. This drakon had notably devoured at least one demigod, so it had likely attracted the attention of Camp Half-Blood, who had probably sent somebody to murder it. Maybe that devoured demigod should’ve just left its habitat alone? In terms of transportation, the closest established war camp to the objective was in Louisville, Kentucky. Unfortunately, the network of Atlas’s forces was still recovering and didn’t have complete coverage like Camp Half-Blood, who wooed the gods for more efficient demigod transportation. Time is of the essence. 

Once Daulat had arrived to White Sulphur Springs, he was to first offer the drakon something, something more valuable than his own demigod flesh. Atlas’s cultists were already preparing some concoction that would please the drakon. Then, he would have to negotiate terms with it, employ psychological manipulation if need be. Not Daulat’s strongest suit, but he was a medic who knew how to calm his patients without a sedative (usually). Once the asset was secured, the transportation phase could take place, which was above Daulat’s “paygrade”. 

Daulat ducked out of the command tent, beaming with golden warmth as always despite the new lump in his throat. He worked on gathering his weapons and medical materials as he awaited the courier sent by the alchemists. His claymore was already strapped to his back, and he rifled through his self-grown herb stores to grab anything the drakon might need if it was wounded. Chamomile and lavender poultice for gashes. Turmeric and tea tree oil for any skin infections. Aloe vera for possible burns. A confident but soft smile to make sure he didn’t get eaten. All present and accounted for. 

He debated whether or not he should wear armor. It wasn’t a mission into an active war zone, and armor wouldn’t do anything against the venomous and crushing fangs of a drakon. However, if he ran into one of Olympus’s lapdogs, some armor would be a nice failsafe in case he did get struck. He shrugged and decided to put some light armor over his outfit, a soft cream sweater and some camo cargo pants. His coffee-brown hiking boots would suffice; he wasn’t Achilles or anything. 

The courier arrived at the medic tent as he was slipping his armor on, having a little trouble slipping it over his body. From the dark depths of within the armor, he heard an exasperated sigh, the sound of something being set down (it wasn’t metal, he couldn’t sense it), and felt the chest plate being forcefully shoved over his torso. He blinked away the rush of light as the face of an impatient alchemist came into focus. 

“Thanks for de help, boss.” Daulat drawled in his pitchy and slightly raspy New Orleans accent. He straightened out the chest plate and began to re-harness his claymore to his back.

“I was sent to give this to you. Stop fooling around and get going.” 

“Mah bad, grandad.” Daulat rolled his eyes with a dumb smile on his face. “Ah’ll remember to tell you to ‘get goin’’ de next time yall want some of mah herb supplies. An’ weren’ ya supposed to be here fifteen minutes ago?” The alchemist just huffed before stalling off, muttering something about “those meddling kids”. Daulat shrugged and tightened his utility belt, now filled with any emergency medical supplies and with his herb jar with the parental allowance he was so “generously allotted” by his oligarch of a father. 

“Okay. Let’s do dis.”

As golden hour cast the Bay Area in broad strokes of copper and brass, Daulat checked over his materials one more time, tightened the claymore on his back, pulled up the crew neck of his plush sweater, and stepped through the portal to Louisville.

***Date: Friday, August 29th, 2040***

***Time: 3:13 A.M. CDT***

***Location: The War Camp at Louisville, Kentucky***

It was just past midnight when Daulat stepped into the dusty war camp of Louisville, the warm midnight air kissing his lightly tanned skin. He stared around at the small battalion stationed at the camp as he moved through it, careful not to disturb the resting soldiers. The golden smile on his face twitched with something darker, something sharper. The camp had been completed only a couple months ago, if that, but was already looking like a proper war camp. He pushed the resurfacing memory of New London out of his mind and focused on finding passage for the next leg of his journey. 

They didn’t have a portal anywhere closer to West Virginia, so what was he supposed to do, Demigod Uber? He still had his parental allowance to pay his way, though that wouldn’t work for mortal hitchhiking. He checked a road atlas stuffed in his deep cargo pants pocket. The quickest route was by car on I-64 E, which would take around 6 hours to get to his destination. He had to get there as fast as possible. Unfortunately, hitchhiking was dangerous and unpredictable. Luckily, he had allegiance with many monsters as a champion of Atlas, monsters who might want some of his spare change. And a little convincing. 

He hated to do this, but money did talk. 

He knew that, being a demigod, he would attract monsters, especially if he was trying to hitchhike along a highway. And he also knew that many monsters had already pledged their allegiance to Atlas. Confidence would be key to not get absolutely curb stomped on the highway. He sought out a cyclops that was heading up the highway from Louisville who had stopped at the camp to refuel and gather some supplies for transport down in the southeast. Daulat jumped at the opportunity. The cyclops wanted a couple drachma and would only take him up to Lexington before peeling off to go down south, but it was the best Daulat was gonna get at the camp. 

The ride was uneventful, fields upon fields of crops. Daulat watched the workers in the fields, and it grated on him how hard they work for so little pay. So many wealthier people didn’t do half as much work, and they were eating the food that these farmers were breaking their backs over. The farmers whose tables were bare while the fields outside burst with sustenance they could never consume. He tried to push it down, the cyclops in the driver's seat seemed to shift uncomfortably sensing his rage, and he couldn’t risk getting booted out of the car into no-man’s-land. 

Once he reached Lexington and bid the supply-run cyclops ado, he continued his routine of confidently offering a couple drachma to get unscathed passage on the highway. In Lexington, he had located a monstrous trucker at a gas station on the eastern edge of the city, who managed to take him up to Huntington before it realized it had skipped breakfast and brunch, and it tried to have a little sample of a Pashto kid to tide it over. Daulat had to knock it out with the hilt of his claymore. He left a poultice to reduce swelling  next to its head with a sassy note to eat some KFC next time he had a long-haul trip.

From Huntington, he took a commuter bus to Charleston. No need to offer drachma that time, just a bunch of mortals wondering what a kid with a weird outfit and a carefree grin was doing sitting in a commuter bus driving through the center of Appalachia. They didn’t ask questions. He probably wouldn’t have answered any questions anyway. 

Finally, from Charleston, he jumped onto a tour bus going to the resort at White Sulphur Springs, where he knew the drakon would be waiting. The golden glint in his eyes practically sparkled with the thought of the payoff that would aid their cause. He suddenly noticed how strong the winds were outside of the moving vehicle as it wound through the mountains along the highway.

Holding onto the side of a tour bus was perfectly safe…right?

***Date: Friday, August 29th, 2040***

***Time: 6:39 P.M. EDT***

***Location: White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia***

Well, that was a new kind of awful. He still couldn’t believe it had taken him over twelve hours to reach White Sulphur Springs. Connecting routes on the fly, fighting a cyclops trying to eat you as you sat strapped into the shotgun seat. And he meant *literally* tied to the shotgun seat. And never again, *never again*, was he going to hold onto the outside of any vehicle again to go from point A to point B, especially not when the highway bobbed and weaved through mountains every ten seconds at 70 miles per hour. 

He stumbled off the bus, his nose buried in one of his lavender poultices to dispel his nausea and vertigo. “Ey, where yat? What time is it?” He asked the tour bus driver, a kindly old woman with her whitening hair tied back a librarian’s bun. She hadn’t seen him on the back of the bus clinging onto the ladder, and regarded him with the kindness of what he assumed his grandma would’ve regarded him with if he was still living in Afghanistan. 

“About quarter before seven, dearie. Where are your parents?” 

“Bathroom. Dey jus’ asked me to find out de time.” The lie flowed like liquid gold from his lips, and he momentarily felt bad for tricking this lady just trying to do her job. “Tanks, by de way. Have a good day!” He said, not wanting to immerse himself in the awkwardness for much longer. 

*Now, where was that drakon?*

Daulat was informed that it resided in the springs at the resort, and so he grabbed a directory at the front of the resort and followed the little tick-marked path to the little ellipse of pale blue on the waxy paper. He smiled to himself, humming a punk tune, his fluffy black-brown hair billowing in the light, humid evening breeze.

When he finally looked up, the brochure fell to the mud puddle on the side of the path. An entire building was splintered and destroyed, no doubt from a larger-than-life skirmish between a demigod and a drakon. Even a fool could tell, and Daulat was at least a hint brighter than your standard fool. Some cars were smashed, the asphalt cracked in places. Rubble and dust was everywhere. Golden monster dust. 

*Motherfu-*

And leaning on an undamaged car, nonchalant as all hell, was a strawberry blonde girl. She was at least two inches taller than him, but if she was the one who had killed the drakon, maybe she would be too exhausted to put up much of a fight. He scanned her with his **Fortune Sense**. She had healed, no curses had been placed upon her, and she didn’t look like she was going to go down without a fight. Her exhaustion level wasn’t as high as he expected it to be. Daulat hesitated for a split second, analyzing her like analyzing one of his patients in the medic tent. But then, he stole a glance to the springs, coated in a fine layer of gold.

The payoff was gone. The asset was gone. This creature, just defending its home from intruding demigods, was gone. A rage glinted in his eyes like all the jewels and gold in the world. 

Daulat didn’t think. He lunged, claymore unstrapped from the harness across his armor and in his hands. “You… you BITCH!”",1,1756929501.0,CampHalfBloodRP,2,1.0,False
1n7p6re,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDpartners/comments/1n7p6re/getting_close_to_breaking_point/,Getting Close to Breaking Point,"First of all, I’m so glad to have found this group. For the first time I don’t feel completely alone having a partner with PMDD. 

We’ve been together 6 years, married for 1. Diagnosed with PMDD about 6 months ago. Medication and therapy seem to be helping, but I’m (we) still trying to understand how to navigate this. 

We get into our fair share of arguments, but they tend to go very very poorly and I’m realizing I am not always aware that the PMDD is a factor. I mentioned to her today that moving forward I think it’s important for us to address PMDD together to try to resolve our conflicts better. She was immediately defensive and laid blame on our arguments entirely on me and that it’s just convenient for me to say it had anything to do with PMDD. I Have owned and admitted fault (albeit she is complicit in the situation) for our recent fight, but also believe it would not have escalated so much if it weren’t for her condition. 

She proceeded to call me names and berate me so I began to lose my temper. I hit a coffee mug out of her hand and it broke. Instant regret. I am not proud of it and apologized almost immediately. I wish I had shown more restraint.  She threatened to call the police and told me to pack a bag and leave the house for a week until we sort out how to move forward. 

I’d probably be long gone if it weren’t for our beautiful daughter. It’s important to me to provide her with a safe and stable life. It’s beginning to feel like no matter how great our life is/can be these defining moments happen too frequently. She has threatened divorce multiple times over things of much less severity. I’m in so much anguish. I’m always walking eggshells. I am so exhausted of all of the insults and torment/threats for our future. 

I don’t know if we will make it and I’m unsure if it’s even worth it anymore. She continuously tells me I’m the problem and I need to fix us never taking any accountability herself. That she does all the work and I don’t contribute to our healing. I’m prepared for marriage counseling which we have tried in the past, but tends not to work since I feel like her view of our relationship is so biased. This is just the reality we live in, things are good, we heal and mend, then it erupts in an instance and it’s back to square one. 

Anyway, thanks for listening.

1n7p690,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1n7p690/i_need_a_break/,I need a break,"I just feel so defeated after my morning sickness & vomiting getting worse after hitting 12 weeks & when I called the doctor's office that week to tell them, the nurse basically told me ""well you're supposed to be feeling better now"" when I asked to go on Zofran because nothing else was working. Luckily, I had an appointment a few days later where my OB agreed that Zofran was the next step since nothing else was working. It has helped a ton but I definitely it's just masking symptoms and not that I'm getting better.

Now at 14 weeks, I am extremely constipated. Stool softeners have made me throw up immediately after taking them so I resorted to glycerin suppositories (a god send). However, I again got on the phone with the nurse today to ask how often I can do those since I literally am having no bowel movement (5+ days without going) and she goes on to tell me morning sickness is actually worse now at 14 weeks. LIKE CAN WE JUST PICK A LANE AND STICK TO IT? It's so frustrating to read so many conflicting things but then also to have your nurses tell you contradicting things is very annoying.

I also had coffee today in a desperate attempt to have some sort of bowl movement (after not having it since being pregnant because it started grossing me out) and it did made me go to the bathroom but I immediately threw up after finishing it.

  
I just want a little break to feel somewhat normal. All I need is two days to feel human. Is that too much to ask for?! Being pregnant is something I always looked forward to because it is such a privilege to have a body that is capable of carrying a child,  but I can't help but hate this and it just makes me sad and annoyed that I am not having the experience I had once hoped for. I still feel very lucky that my baby is healthy but just really needed to rant.

She also tends to hyper-fixate on possible partners that are terrible communicators and it’s very hard for her to just take them as they are and move on, and instead puts all the blame on herself. A lot of the times that she calls she speaks to me about guy trouble and today was yet another call where she was being breadcrumbed and couldn’t understand why the guy wouldn’t communicate with her. I’m not gonna lie, she was in a really rough spot. She was crying and kept beating herself down and berating herself because she messaged him after he was being distant and she kept saying how she just wants to be worthy of love. I tried to tell her that the guy isn’t worth her time and to just move forward, and that she shouldn’t measure her worth on the kind of romantic love a possible partner could give her but rather with the love she can find within herself. 

She then she asked me what I was doing today and I said that after gym and work I had plans to go out dancing as well as to meet up with someone I was interested in, and she then suggested if she could tag along. I said that it probably wasn’t the best idea because it would be an environment with alcohol and strangers and, since I cared about her, I didn’t want to go out worrying for her safety. I then suggested if she would like to meet up tomorrow instead for some coffee and she agreed at first, but then said if I could cancel plans for tonight and instead go over to her place and watch movies. I declined since I already made those plans, and she proceeded to tell me “Oh, so you DON’T want to hang out with me?”. I then reminded her that we just made plans to meet up tomorrow instead, and she replied with “No, it’s ok. I have school and you have work” even though we agreed to meet up at a time where she was out of class and before I had to go to work. I then told her that I didn’t appreciate being guilt-tripped, and she exclaimed that she wasn’t guilt-tripping and that she just wanted to hang up and talk to someone else. I then said “Alright, bye” and hung up the call just as she also said the same thing. 

I care about my friend, but she’s not exactly in the best mental state right now and I know that if she went out with me she would just be getting drunk and putting herself in an even tougher spot from which I would have to act as a babysitter and take care of her. Which is why I suggested an activity that would be a bit less chaotic and one that really allowed us to talk. But I still feel bad for saying no to hanging out tonight.

when the night gets too quiet,  
a phantom limb,  
a half-remembered hymn.  

How many times have I carved that confession,  
into the walls of my ribs?  
How many prayers,  
before the wound becomes a scar?  

I see you in the pause between traffic lights,  
in the way coffee steam curls,  
fragile, vanishing.  
How are you?  
Three words, a blade twisted slow.   

I practiced them in the mirror,  
in the shower,  
in the hollow of my throat where your laughter used to live.    

I am learning to hold myself,  
the way I should have held you,  
careful,  
certain.  

But the past doesn’t fold neatly.  
It’s a crooked spine,  
a book I keep reopening,  
to the same dog-eared page.  

Maybe redemption is a slow bloom,  
a thing that grows in the dark,  
while no one watches.   

Maybe one day,  
when I’ve earned the right to stand,  
without flinching,  
the universe will exhale,   

and there you’ll be,  
not as a ghost,  
but as the light,  
breaking through.  

Until then,  
I am rebuilding,  
a man,  
who could deserve you.

Then, bang. Ruined a flexor tendon in my right arm, I struggled to lift my coffee cup out of my cup holder, could barely use my right arm for anything. 

Thought it would get better but it didn’t, I struggled with it for 8-9 weeks before getting into physio, getting some shock therapy, acupuncture, ultrasonic and massaging, which got me at least partially straightened out. 

Did some research and realised I’d been ignoring half of my forearm 

Recently got these IronMind bands to build up my very neglected extensors and feel better after just a few days. It’s also amazing how week I feel in that aspect

Hey Travel Trotters! 👋 

Just got back from an amazing trip to Barcelona and wanted to share some insider knowledge I picked up from an incredible local guide that completely transformed my experience. Barcelona can be overwhelming for first-timers (I was definitely lost my first day!), but with these pro tips, you'll navigate like a local in no time!

## Find a Guide with ACTUAL Experience 🧠

Let me tell you something that made all the difference - my guide had been working in Barcelona tourism for 27+ years! The difference between someone who's been showing tourists around for decades versus someone who just learned the script last month is HUGE. 

When you're jet-lagged and trying to absorb centuries of history, you need someone who knows how to keep things interesting and can read your group's energy. My guide could tell when we needed coffee breaks or when we were ready for more detailed stories.

## Academic Background = Better Stories 📚

This blew my mind - the best guides actually studied the stuff they're talking about! My guide had a legit Art History degree, and it showed when explaining Gaudí's work. Instead of just pointing at Sagrada Família and giving basic facts, he connected architectural elements to historical movements and cultural shifts.

When someone has academic credentials, they give you those ""aha!"" moments that make travel truly memorable. The stories stick with you long after the trip ends.

## Not Just Anyone Can Be a Guide in Barcelona 🔍

Did you know Catalonia actually tests and licenses their guides? It's not like some places where anyone with a flag can lead tours. Legit guides have passed linguistic exams and earned official credentials from the Catalan Government.

This means they're professionals who take their job seriously - not just someone doing this between ""real"" jobs. The knowledge difference is immediately obvious.

## Understanding the Mediterranean Lifestyle 🍷🫒

My guide didn't just show us buildings - he introduced us to a completely different way of life! The Mediterranean approach to time, food, and social connection is fascinating.

He explained Catalonia's complex history and relationship with Spain in a way that suddenly made sense of everything from language differences to political stickers we spotted around town. This context completely changed how I experienced the city.

## Beyond Barcelona's Tourist Traps 🏔️

While Barcelona itself is amazing, the surrounding areas hold incredible treasures! My guide took us to Montserrat (that mountain monastery with the Black Madonna and incredible boys' choir), which I might have missed trying to plan everything myself.

The real magic was discovering spots even my well-traveled friends hadn't heard about. There was this Game of Thrones filming location in Girona that was STUNNING and practically empty of tourists.

## Skip-the-Line Actually Matters ⏰

I'm usually skeptical of ""skip-the-line"" promises, but having a licensed guide in Barcelona is legitimate time-magic. My guide walked us right past HOURS-long queues at Park Güell and Sagrada Família.

We saved literally an entire day of vacation time by not standing in lines. Plus, our guide handled all ticket logistics, which meant no fumbling with booking websites or printing tickets.

## Bonus Tip: Base Yourself in Barcelona 🏠

Instead of constantly changing hotels, my guide recommended staying in Barcelona the whole time and doing day trips. This was genius! We unpacked once, got to know our neighborhood, and found ""our"" local coffee shop where they recognized us by the third day.

This approach let us experience that famous Mediterranean lifestyle instead of constantly being in transit. We felt like temporary locals rather than tourists rushing through.

## Finding Your Perfect Guide

Look for guides with:
- Extensive experience (20+ years is gold)
- Academic background in history, art, or architecture
- Official Catalan Government credentials
- Ability to take you beyond the main sites
- Skip-the-line privileges
- Knowledge of local food and culture

## My Travel Hack for Planning 💡

I used to spend DAYS researching and planning trips, but for Barcelona I discovered this amazing site that made everything so much easier! I could compare flight prices, find hotels in the best neighborhoods, and even book activities all in one place.

It saved me literally hundreds of dollars on flights alone, and the neighborhood guides helped me pick the perfect base for our stay. [Check it out here for your next adventure!](https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H)

## Final Thoughts 🌟

Barcelona wasn't just another checkmark on my travel list - it became one of those transformative experiences that changes how you see the world. Having expert guidance made all the difference between rushing through tourist spots and truly understanding this incredible city.

1n7oyv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n7oyv0/yet_it_moves/,Yet It Moves?,"So I was watching this guy, sitting alone in the café where I work. He'd been there for hours, staring at an empty coffee cup, and I kept glancing over because it was a slow night with not much else to do, and because there was something fascinating with the way he was focused on the thing. Then it happened—a few hours in I swear I saw the cup *shift*…as in move across the table, on its own. It startled him, I mean it startled me too but I've been doing this a long time and a good service worker knows how to temper reactions. He got up, looking rattled, gathered his things, and made a beeline for the door.

But he didn't gather the coffee cup. That was the first realization I had after he'd hustled out the door. I paused in the middle of wiping down the same table for the fifth time—slow night, like I said—and allowed my gaze to fall directly on the table for the first time in hours.

""Huh."" I wasn't sure what else to say, even to myself. It was just me on shift, and with the only customer now gone, it was just me in the café. Closing time was coming up fast, and given the amount of business we'd had this evening I figured I'd be doing the owner a favor if I flipped the sign a little early and started cleaning up in earnest. So I did. Working around the table with the mug sitting on it. For now. I didn't want to touch that table just yet.

The mug wasn't anything special. Off-white ceramic, slightly chipped in the middle of the handle, a small line of discoloration running down from the rim nearly to the bottom. It looked small and almost aggressively ordinary in the flickering yellow-verge light of our aging overhead fluorescents.

""What's your deal?"" I said softly. To the mug, yes. You talk to things when you're alone too, and you'd be especially likely to do so after a long lonely shift. Just admit it.

The mug didn't respond. Pretty soon I had everything ready for closing, chairs up on tables, surfaces wiped down, machines carefully cleaned out, register locked. Everything except the one table, with its mug.

""What did he see in you?"" I asked the mug. It was still not very forthcoming, so I clocked out, pulled up a chair, and sat down at the table to look at the little porcelain cup. With most of the lights in the café now turned off, it still looked entirely ordinary, but moody somehow, more steeped in its own shadows. This was the closest I'd been to it since the man had left. It made me vaguely nervous in ways I couldn't quite justify, even to myself. Seeing an object scoot a few centimeters wasn't really that big a deal, was it?

""No,"" the mug said. ""I suppose it's not.""

I fell out of the chair, but not before propelling myself backward away from the table at high speed, crashing into an adjoining table, and toppling sideways. I scrambled to my feet, instinctively righting the chair and putting it between myself and the coffee cup. Not sure what good I thought that would do me. The mug continued to sit on the table, unperturbed.

""What did you say?"" The panic and fragility in my own voice scared me more, I mean consciously anyway, than what I thought I'd heard from the mug itself. Thought I'd heard. Thought I'd heard. I let that echo in my head like a mantra. Maybe I was just a little crazy, that was the better option. I'd had a long shift, it was late, I was tired.

I stared at the cup, waiting for it to comment. It didn't.

I thought back to the man who had also stared at the thing. When it moved, had it been toward him, or away from him? Suddenly that question seemed very important. Why couldn't I remember? Maybe it had been kind of sideways.

Nope. Nope nope nope. Not right now. I picked up the chairs around the small table and put them up in rapid succession, leaving the mug sitting within a sort of cage made of cheap institutional steel. Not much of a cage, but then it hadn't shown the ability to move much. If at all. Sometimes, things moved, that was fine.

Sometimes people heard voices.

I went off toward the exit, keys in hand. I heard something move behind me. Just the small sound of porcelain on polished wood. No big deal. I didn't even walk faster. I'm pretty sure.

Then I heard a chair crash to the floor, and I ran. I reached the door, slipped through, shut it, locked it with shaking hands. I stood with my back to it a moment, not daring, not daring, until I finally did, and turned around.

It was too dark inside to see. After a few tries I got the flashlight working from my phone LED. I shined it around.

One chair fallen on the floor. A coffee cup beside it, sitting unperturbed, casting long shadows from the harsh bright light.

""Why?"" I mouthed toward the glass.

""Why not?"" the mug said, and it moved toward me. I saw it move. I saw it.

I swear to you I saw it. But that's okay. Sometimes things move, that's fine.

Just remember, next time you're alone, in a perfectly ordinary place full of perfectly ordinary things.

Just remember that.



I mean, what could they possibly want with you?

Here's how it happened.

Five years ago, I lost both my grandparents to preventable chronic diseases. Diabetes, heart disease, things that lifestyle changes could have prevented. Unexpectedly having them pass away hit me like a freight train. I looked at my own life and realized I was running toward the same fate. Ultra-processed food for nearly every meal, rarely exercised, sleeping 4-5 hours a night thinking I was ""grinding.""

Their deaths changed everything. I went full wellness mode, and I became obsessed with wellness. Cut processed foods to zero. Started hitting the gym 5x a week (strength, cardio, HIIT, etc). Discovered what ""sleep hygiene"" actually means. Within a year, I was that guy with the Mushroom Coffee, the Thorne/Momentous supplements stack, AG1, HVMN, Whoop on my wrist, Equinox membership. Honestly, if it promised to optimize something, I probably tried it.

My wellness obsession became expensive. Fast. I was dropping $6,000-7,000 a year on this stuff. But I didn't care. This was an investment in my health and future self. This was my health insurance against chronic disease.

Meanwhile, my HSA sat there with $20,000+ invested in index funds. My company threw in $1,000 yearly, I maxed out the rest. Like everyone else, I thought HSAs were for doctor visits and maybe some Advil. So it just sat there, growing.

Then last year, my finance-obsessed friend (you know the type, tracks every cent in spreadsheets) mentioned: ""You know all that wellness stuff is HSA eligible with a doctor's note, right?""

I thought he was full of shit. No way the IRS lets you use tax-free money for gym memberships and supplements.

He was right. I was wrong.

I went down the rabbit hole. IRS Publication 502, Section 213(d). It's all there in black and white. Anything used to ""diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease"" qualifies with a Letter of Medical Necessity. Gym memberships. Supplements. Wearables. Saunas. Cold Plunges.

The math made me want to throw up:

* $7,000/year in wellness spending
* 30% effective tax rate
* 4 years of paying with after-tax dollars
* $8,400 lit on fire 

But most of my friends say... ""doesn't matter, keep it invested for retirement healthcare costs."" They're wrong, and here's the math:

I'm 30 now. If I max my HSA until 65 and get 8% returns (compounding), I'll have just over $1 million. Fidelity's 2024 estimate says an individual needs about $172,500 for healthcare costs in retirement. That leaves $827,500 that I'd pay taxes on if I withdraw for non-medical expenses (let's say 25% tax rate = $206,875 gone to taxes).

BUT if I save receipts for $7,000/year in wellness expenses for 35 years, that's $245,000 I can pull out completely tax-free in retirement. No taxes. Ever. Plus I still have $755,000 in the HSA for traditional, non-preventive healthcare costs. More than enough.",1,1756928737.0,HSAeligibility,0,1.0,False

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

I built a solution.,"Job searching is brutal right now, especially in tech market. Most people need to submit 500+ applications to land a job, and keeping track of them all is a nightmare. I used to rely on google sheets and Trello boards, but they created more problems than they solved:

The pain points I experienced:

* Clicking tiny cells to enter data is tedious and might cause mistakes
* Missing interview time or assignment deadline often
* Generic process doesn't fit to all applications
* Impossible to take detailed notes for each stage of the process
* No way to prioritize which applications deserve more attention

Try the app here: [https://www.job-flow.app/](https://www.job-flow.app/)

My solution: I built a job application tracker designed specifically for modern job seekers.

These are the Key features:

✅ Lightning-fast status updates - Update your application stage with one click

✅ Never miss deadlines - Built-in date track

✅ Fully customizable - Customize each application process to your specific needs

✅ Stage-by-stage notes - Document your entire journey for each application

✅ Smart prioritization - Star important applications to stay focused

While this app is optimized for tech roles, it works for anyone who wants to organize their job search effectively.

About me: I'm a solo developer who built this from scratch - from brainstorming the concept to designing the UI to coding every feature. I created this because I lived through the same frustrations you're experiencing.

It's completely free - I'm covering all hosting costs because I believe good tools shouldn't be another barrier to finding work.

Want to help make it better? There's an easy feedback section in the app for suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests. I'm also looking forward to collaborate with engineers if you're interested in contributing or making this product bigger.

Support the project: If this helps your job search, consider buying me a coffee to fuel future features!

\
Alt text: Professional business people collaborating in a modern office setting., Bahrain’s non-oil sector grew by 5.2% in Q1 2025, beating regional averages. The Forbes Business 2025 Outlook names Bahrain as a Gulf pioneer in fintech, logistics, and professional services. The ease of doing business, paired with 100% foreign ownership options and flexible regulatory frameworks, underpins strong investor confidence.\
\
Business Formation: Streamlined through Sijilat, with new business registrations up 12% year-on-year (bahrain.com).\
Company Closures: While business births are strong, an efficient, reliable exit route is equally important. Voluntary liquidation in Bahrain is strategically structured, protecting both stakeholders and the broader ecosystem.\
\
Importantly, 2025 saw a new regulatory shift—the MOICT’s “Digital Liquidation Certification Program” (effective April 2025)—which now requires submission of certified digital closure documents via the Sijilat platform. This update means faster processing but also stricter digital audit standards. (I recall spending an extra afternoon with my client ensuring all our files met the new PDF/A-1b format before submission—saved us a week’s delay.)\
\
Understanding Voluntary Liquidation in Bahrain\
What Is Voluntary Liquidation?\
Voluntary liquidation—a process where a company’s shareholders decide to wind up operations and dissolve the entity—differs from forced or compulsory liquidation (triggered by insolvency or court order).\
Industries such as trading, professional services, or holding companies often choose this route for reasons like market shifts, group restructuring, or simply new ventures on the horizon.\
Key Stages\
\
Shareholder resolution to liquidate\
Appointment of a licensed liquidator\
Asset realization and debt settlement\
Regulatory approvals and public notifications\
Final de-registration and closure\
\
Bahrain’s MOICT (Ministry of Industry and Commerce), LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority), and Tamkeen oversee most procedural steps, while the Sijilat system serves as the digital gateway for submissions.\
\
Types of Companies Eligible for Voluntary Liquidation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain office meeting.\
* Single person companies (SPC)\
* Joint stock companies (B.S.C.)\
* Free zone entities (within Bahrain’s free zones)\
* Representative offices and branches\
Each structure comes with its own nuances. For deep details, refer to this master guide: Bahrain Business Type Structures.\
Surprisingly, even with 99% foreign ownership allowances, foreign shareholders enjoy the same straightforward exit rights as locals—a policy Bahrain rolled out much sooner than neighboring Saudi Arabia.\

Tip: Schedule your meeting just before Ramadan or after Eid for lighter ministry queues—they adjust working hours, and it’s easier to secure a slot at the MOICT in the Diplomatic Area. (Personal aside: Last-minute Eid closures once cost my client two weeks. Now, I always buffer an extra week.)\
\
2. Appointment of a Licensed Liquidator\
Choose a MOICT-registered and insured liquidator—typically a CPA firm or law office. Fees start around BHD 1,000–2,500+ depending on company complexity.\
\
Insider shortcut: Opt for a liquidator with an in-house notary—saves trips to the courthouse when authenticating documents.\
\
3. Official Application via Sijilat\
Prepare and upload these digitally certified PDFs:\
* Liquidation resolution\
* List of assets and liabilities\
* Audited financials (latest fiscal year)\
* Current employee register (from LMRA)\
* Commercial Registration (CR) certificate\
If you’re in the Seef District, the Sijilat walk-in helpdesk is the fastest—average queue waits are under 25 minutes before 11am.\
4. Public Notice of Liquidation\
Publish the notice in two local newspapers (in both Arabic and English). This officially triggers the creditor claims period: 45 days for WLLs and SPCs; 90 days for BSCs.\
\
Common mistake: Missing newspaper publication deadlines resets waiting periods. Always request a digital proof of publication.\
\
5. Settlement of Liabilities\
\
Settle all tax, supplier, and employee dues.\
Obtain “No Objection Certificates” (NOC) from VAT, LMRA, Tamkeen, and custom authorities.\
\
Pro tip: Early in the process, use Tamkeen’s “Business Support Hotline” to expedite employee clearance.\
6. Realization and Distribution of Assets\
The liquidator will dispose of company assets—real estate, vehicles, inventory—then distribute proceeds according to shareholder agreements.\
7. Final Filing and Deregistration\
After the creditor claims period, submit the final liquidation report—signed by both shareholders and liquidator—through Sijilat. MOICT then issues the official company dissolution certificate.\
\
Shortest-case scenario for a simple SPC: 75 working days. WLLs and BSCs may take up to 120 days.\

Cost Considerations: Budgeting for a Voluntary Liquidation in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, business budgeting.\
- Legal/Notary Fees: BHD 200 – 500\
- Government Charges (MOICT, Sijilat): BHD 200 – 750\
- Newspaper Announcement (Arabic & English): BHD 100 – 150 per notice\
- Professional Advisory (optional): BHD 500 – 2,000\
Total conservative budget: BHD 2,000 – 6,000.\
For the most accurate current breakdowns and estimator, check Keylink’s Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
And, never forget: incomplete paperwork (especially missing VAT or LMRA clearances) delays processing and drives up legal/advisory bills. (Personal story: I once had to run with a client across Manama from the LMRA office to the MOICT, chasing a single missing NOC—an avoidable headache.)\

Regulatory tangent: Bahrain’s digital document mandate in 2025 is part of a broader move toward e-government. E-residency cards now double as digital certificate signers for most filings—a convenience UAE still struggles to match.\

\
Comparing Bahrain to UAE and Saudi Arabia\
Bahrain’s approach is vastly more entrepreneur-friendly. Unlike Dubai’s sometimes unpredictable cancellation inspections or Saudi Arabia’s need for multiple simultaneous ministry clearances, Bahrain uses a single-window Sijilat portal and more consistent timeframes. Human hospitality also stands out—government officials here will often share a coffee with you while helping solve a paperwork snag.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Unique Local Insights\
Bahraini business culture is steeped in tradition—majlis meetings, Ramadan-adjusted work hours, and an openness to relationship-building. Making time for coffee, showing respect in all formal meetings, and understanding the wasta (influence/network) dynamic can open doors—even when closing one’s business.\
And, never skip the traditional coffee service at your closure meeting—it’s more than a formality, it’s a mark of respect, often remembered long after the paperwork is filed.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions: Bahrain Company Liquidation\
1. How long does voluntary liquidation usually take in Bahrain?\
\
For a simple SPC or WLL, 75–120 working days is standard, depending on completeness of documents and creditor claim periods.\
\
2. What is the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make during liquidation?\
\
Failing to clear all employee and LMRA registrations—this leaves the company “in limbo” with fines accruing.\
\
3. Can foreigners fully control and close their company in Bahrain?\
\
Absolutely—99% ownership rights guarantee expats identical closure rights to locals, including in free zones.\
\
4. What documents are needed for the process?\
\
Board/shareholder resolution, audited statements, liquidator appointment, asset/liability register, employee/LMRA clearance, NOCs, and compliance certificates. For more, see accounting and compliance guide.\
\
5. Where can I get help with Bahrain company liquidation?\
\
For hands-on support: Keylink’s liquidation and company formation team. For regulatory updates, consult bahrain.com or Gulf News’s Bahrain section.\

So, I have found myself without transportation currently. I'm working on fixing that, still determining whether to fix my car or get a new one, and saving the money for it either way. That said, I need to figure out a more solid means of getting to and from work. I figured, what the hell. Chances are slim, but the internet's a weird place. Maybe I'll find someone who happens to drive from near where I live to near where I work when I have to be there, or vice versa.

I work off of Iroquois Ave in Harborcreek, start at 7:30am. Can be there earlier. I get out at five and live off Robison Rd in Summit.

So, if you drive from \~ Robison Rd in Summit to around \~ Iroquois Ave around 7am and want a morning ridealong buddy, or if you're coming the other way around 5pm or a bit later, on a regular Monday - Friday basis, I guess let me know?

Also, for context, this isn't normal for me. I recently had a colonoscopy for a separate issue that came back perfect so I know everything's fine.

Coffee is not water. Stop pounding it at 5pm and wondering why you’re staring at the ceiling at 2am. Be strategic, not chaotic.

2. Mind-map your classes
Before lectures pile up, grab a sheet and map out each course + big topics. Turns your brain into a spider web of connections instead of a random soup of notes. And yes, there’s science that says it boosts memory.


3. Build buffer time
Stop scheduling life like you’re a robot. Add 10–15 min cushions between things. That way, when class runs late or you spiral on a calc problem, you don’t nuke your whole day.


4. Change your scenery
Your bed is for sleep, not essays. Rotate in a café, library, or even a park bench. New environment = new focus, and you’ll dodge the “oh look my fridge again” problem.

1n7ooa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1n7ooa9/explore_best_laundry_detergent_for_sensitive_skin/,Explore Best Laundry Detergent for Sensitive Skin All Mighty Pacs,"Testing the All Mighty Pacs Laundry Detergent, Free Clear for Sensitive Skin, Tub, 60 Count has been quite an enlightening experience in my daily laundry routine. As someone with sensitive skin and family members who occasionally break out due to poorly matched detergents, I’ve come to rely on products that promise gentleness without compromising cleaning power. With this product, I found that delicate balance of performance and sensitivity—something that plenty of competing detergents fail to deliver.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
Laundry day can already be a chore, so simple solutions are a lifesaver. The design of these laundry pacs is brilliantly practical. Each pac contains a pre-measured amount of detergent, eliminating the guesswork of pour-too-much or pour-too-little measuring. You just toss one into the washing machine and move on—really, it’s that simple. And with 60 pacs in the tub, you don’t have to worry about running out mid-cycle. 

**Positives**  
- Hypoallergenic and perfect for sensitive skin, offering a fragrance-free and dye-free experience.  
- Compatible with any washing machine type, including high-efficiency models.  
- Effectively tackles everyday dirt, ranging from pet hair to grass and pollen.  

[Check All Mighty Pacs Laundry Detergent, Free Clear for Sensitive Skin, Tub, 60 Count on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b07rj7pchr/)

**Cleaning Performance**  
The performance of these pacs is where they really shine. Despite being 100% free of dyes and perfumes, they don’t skimp on cleaning power. Grass stains from my kid’s soccer games, cat fur from the family feline, and even the occasional spilled coffee on shirts didn’t stand a chance. It’s clear the detergent was formulated cleverly for effectiveness across a range of common household messes.

**Benefits**  
- Concentrated cleaning power in compact pacs.  
- Strong recommendation by dermatologists and pediatricians for people with sensitive skin.  
- Convenient all-in-one design eliminates the need for additional softeners or fragrances.  

**Shortcomings**  
- While gentle on skin, it may not have the deep-cleaning action needed for heavy-duty, greasy messes.  
- The pacs occasionally stick together, which can be annoying when trying to grab just one.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this detergent to similar alternatives like Tide Pods Free & Gentle or Seventh Generation Free & Clear, the performance of All Mighty Pacs Free Clear stands out in terms of skin-friendliness. The Tide Pods, for instance, excel in stain removal, but they sometimes leave a faint scent even in their “free” variant. On the other hand, Seventh Generation Free & Clear doesn’t seem to have the same robustness for tackling pet hair and outdoor stains. In short, this product feels like the most well-rounded pick for households juggling cleanliness and skin sensitivity.

**Quality for Price**  
When thinking about cost efficiency, this detergent fares quite well among its peers. Each pac being pre-measured reduces waste, giving you exactly what you need for a normal load. While you might pay slightly more upfront for a sensitive-skin-oriented detergent, its performance makes that a worthy tradeoff. The convenience and care it provides far outweigh its cost when spread across 60 washes.

•	 I did toy with the idea of doing a cook-book. The recipes were to be the routine ones: how to make dry toast, instant coffee, hearts of lettuce and brownies. But as an added attraction, at no extra charge, my idea was to put a fried egg on the cover. I think a lot of people who hate literature but love fried eggs would buy it if the price was right.
•	 A likely story — and probably true.
•	  I did a bond tour during the Second World War... We were raising money, and we played Boston and Philadelphia and most of the big cities. And we got to Minneapolis. There wasn't any big theater to play there, so we did our show in a railroad station. Then I told the audience that I knew a girl in Minneapolis. She was also known in St.Paul, she used to come over to visit me. She was known as ""The Tail Of Two Cities."" I didn't sell any more bonds, but eh... they didn't allow me to appear anymore.

It wasn’t bad. After reading about stalling, ended up grinding a little too coarse (K-Ultra 10) and it drained too fast, but still came out ok. Will drop down to an 8 next time and see how that goes. Not sure how much it will get used because having very good brews with switch and wave lately, but nice to have!  

Here is what I started as a base recipe. Any suggestions for Rotation type coffees? 

- 1:16
- 202f (this will change based on beans but guessing 198-204 most times)
- K-Ultra 8.0
- Gagne (3x :30 bloom, pulse pours keeping water a little above bed)
- target TDT around 3:15-3:45

1n7oist,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1n7oist/when_our_booking_engine_died_and_accidentally/,When our booking engine died and accidentally made us better at customer service,"Working at a 40-room boutique property in downtown portland and tuesday morning started like any other day until our website booking completely crashed around 10am. Not slow, not glitchy, just completely dead.

Guests trying to book direct kept getting error messages, our phone started ringing nonstop with people asking if we were even still open, and our revenue manager looked like she was about to have a complete meltdown watching potential bookings disappear into the void. The hosting company said maybe four hours to fix it, maybe longer, definitely couldn't give us a real timeline.

That's when our general manager remembered we had set up some basic backup contact form months ago that nobody thought we'd ever actually need. It was buried somewhere on our website, super basic, definitely not pretty, but it worked. We quickly redirected all our booking traffic to this simple form where people could submit their info and we promised to call them back within thirty minutes.

Here's where it gets interesting. Instead of just losing all those potential bookings, we ended up having these amazing conversations with people. When I called the first person back, I expected a quick ""yes we have availability, here's the rate"" type call. But this guest started asking about the neighborhood, wanted restaurant recommendations, was curious about our pet policy because they were thinking of bringing their dog.

Normally with online booking, guests just pick dates and pay without talking to anyone. But now I'm on the phone actually getting to know these people. Found out one couple was celebrating their anniversary, another guest was in town for a job interview and was nervous about it, a family was visiting colleges with their daughter and wanted somewhere walkable to campus.

By the end of that first hour, I had booked more rooms than we usually book online in a whole day. Not because of better rates or promotions, but because people felt connected to our hotel before they even arrived. I could match them with the right room type, suggest local spots that fit their interests, even coordinate special touches for the anniversary couple.

The woman with the job interview booking was so appreciative that someone actually listened to her needs and recommended quiet restaurants nearby where she could prep. The college visit family was thrilled when I mentioned the coffee shop next door opens early and has great wifi if their daughter wanted to study.

Our housekeeping manager overheard some of these calls and started getting excited about the guests we were expecting. When you know someone's story, it's easier to go the extra mile - fresh flowers for the anniversary room, extra quiet room assignment for the interview lady, ground floor for the family with lots of college brochures to carry.

The booking engine finally got fixed around 6pm, but by then we had processed more direct bookings than any tuesday in recent memory. And the quality was different too. These weren't just random bookings from people shopping for the cheapest rate - these were guests who specifically wanted to stay with us because of the personal connection.

The weirdest part was realizing how much we'd been missing with our slick online booking process. Sure it's convenient and efficient, but we weren't building any relationship with guests before they arrived. Now we were getting people who were already excited about their stay and felt like they knew us a little bit.

Started researching backup booking systems on hotel tech report because this definitely couldn't happen again, but also started thinking about how to incorporate more personal touch into our regular booking process. Maybe not every reservation needs a phone call, but there's definitely value in human connection that we'd been overlooking.

Now we have multiple backup systems in place and staff trained on all of them. But we also changed our approach to guest relations. Sometimes the worst technology failures teach you the most important lessons about not putting everything in one digital basket and remembering that personal service still matters even when everything's going high-tech.

The anniversary couple left us a five-star review specifically mentioning the personal attention they received from the moment they first called to book. That's not something that would have happened with just a standard online booking transaction.

1n7oi5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mobile_Proxy_lte/comments/1n7oi5i/i_didnt_think_an_answer_engine_could_replace_my/,I Didn’t Think an “Answer Engine” Could Replace My Marketing Research Workflow… But Then Perplexity Happened,"If you’re in marketing, you’ve probably heard whispers about **Perplexity AI** floating around. It’s been called “the world’s first answer engine,” and honestly, I rolled my eyes at first. I thought:

* “Cool, another shiny AI tool.”
* “Don’t we already have ChatGPT for this?”
* “Sounds like hype.”

But here’s the thing — I tested it in my actual workflow and… yeah. I’m eating my words.

Let’s break this down without the fluff.

# Q: What makes Perplexity different from the usual suspects?

A: **Sources + speed.**

Unlike traditional search engines that vomit a wall of links, Perplexity gives you direct answers with citations. You ask, it scans the web (and other models like GPT-4 + Claude 3), and then spits out a neatly summarized response with clickable references.

For research-heavy marketers like me, that’s a godsend. I can:

* Pull stats for a deck in seconds.
* Double-check sources without chasing broken links.
* Slice my search into *focus modes* (academic papers, social media, even YouTube).

# Q: So what’s the catch with free vs. pro?

Free gives you unlimited basic searches and a handful of Pro queries daily. If you’re just poking around, that’s fine. But the real juice is in **Perplexity Pro** ($20/mo):

* 300+ Pro searches/day
* Deep research (it literally goes through 20–50 pages before answering)
* File uploads (PDFs, docs, spreadsheets)
* Image generation (DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion)
* API + Excel integration

If you’re serious about scaling content, SEO, or market analysis, Pro is where it gets wild.

# Q: How does this actually play out in marketing?

Glad you asked. Here are real ways I’ve slotted it in:

* **Market Research:** Instead of 3 hours of Googling, I now get a solid report in \~10 minutes. Perfect for decks, pitches, or competitor comparisons.
* **Content Creation:** Drafts for blogs, landing pages, and even caption calendars → faster than briefing a junior copywriter.
* **SEO:** Spot trending queries, FAQs, and user intent *with sources baked in*.
* **Campaign Analysis:** Need to brainstorm questions to evaluate a social media push? Ask Perplexity. It’ll outline engagement metrics, CTRs, and the right KPIs to track.
* **Customer Support:** Automated email templates for FAQs (refunds, shipping, follow-ups). It’s basically a fast-typing intern that never sleeps.

# Q: Why not just stick to ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude?

Each has strengths:

* **ChatGPT** is king of creativity + plugins.
* **Gemini** plays nice with YouTube + Google Drive.
* **Claude** is excellent for long-form writing + “project” memory.

But Perplexity’s edge = *research with citations*. It’s the first tool I trust to hand me sources I can copy-paste into a client report without sweating bullets.

# Q: Is it worth adding to your stack?

If you’re a marketer juggling **content + research + reporting**, the answer is yes.

The real kicker? People report cutting **50% of research time** and saving **10–20 hours per week** just by moving repetitive tasks (keyword research, FAQs, blog drafts) into Perplexity.

I’ll say this: it doesn’t replace creative strategy. But it nukes the boring grunt work, freeing you to actually think like a marketer instead of a data clerk.

**Bottom line:** Perplexity isn’t just another AI toy. It’s a workhorse. If ChatGPT feels like a creative co-pilot, Perplexity feels like the researcher you wish you could afford to hire.

1n7oh4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesUnfold/comments/1n7oh4l/after_my_wifes_death_i_kicked_out_her_son/,"After my wife's death, I kicked out her son, thinking that he was not mine and I didn't need him, but ten years later the truth and meeting him turned my life into endless remorse","
 After my wife's death, I put her son out the door - he was not my blood.

Ten years later, the truth surfaced that broke me.

I will never forget that day. The dim light of an autumn morning, the smell of not yet weathered coffee in the kitchen, the rustle of footsteps on the old wooden floor. I was standing in the hallway with my hands clenched into fists, and opposite - a boy who recently turned twelve. His eyes were too old for that age, there was no childish naivety in them. They were cold, empty - just like mine. In front of him was an old bag with a torn belt, into which he hastily put several things. I picked it up and threw it on the floor with some gloomy pleasure. The bag hit the boards blankly, a sweater and an old shabby textbook fell out from the inside.

- Get out, - I said then in a voice in which not a single note trembled. - You are not my son. My wife is gone - I have no reason to take care of you. Go wherever you want.

He didn't burst into tears.

He didn't beg.

He just silently lifted the bag from the floor, carefully put the sweater and textbook back, threw it over his shoulder and, lowering his head, went out the door.

I watched him until the door closed. And I didn't feel anything. No relief, no pain. Only emptiness.

Ten years have passed. Ten years, during which I lived as if nothing had happened. I made a career, got a business, met a woman with whom I was comfortable. I moved to another city, bought a spacious apartment, furnished it to my liking. I threw the past out of my head, as if I had torn out unnecessary pages from a book. But the past is not thrown away. It's waiting. It waits patiently until you stumble yourself, and then comes back like a predator that has been chasing you all this time.

When the phone rang, I didn't even want to pick up the phone. The number was unknown. But something made me press the button. There was a polite female voice at the other end. She invited me to the opening of the art gallery, saying that someone really wants me to be there. I was about to refuse when she added:

- Do you want to know what happened to the child you once abandoned?

These words hit me like a hammer. I froze, squeezing the phone so that my knuckles were white. I haven't really remembered him for ten years. For ten years I lived as if it never existed. But in an instant all these years disappeared, and I again saw a twelve-year-old boy in front of me with a bag over his shoulder, his silent look, his footsteps over the threshold.

- Who are you? - I asked hoarsely.

The woman didn't name herself. I just told me the address and opening time of the gallery. And then I hung up.

I sat for a long time, staring at the wall. It seemed to me that the air became thicker, that there was nothing to breathe in the room. I wanted to convince myself that it was someone's joke. That this can't happen. But my heart was pounding, and I knew it was true.

I didn't sleep all night. My wife stood up in front of my eyes. Her eyes, her smile. She died suddenly - a brain hemorrhage. We didn't even have time to say goodbye. The doctor said: instantly. I was standing in the hospital then, not believing that it had happened. There was a feeling in my chest as if a piece had been torn out. But he was standing next to her, her son. Not mine. And this ""not mine"" became the key then.

I remembered how we met her. I was twenty-six, she was twenty-seven. Beautiful, self-confident, independent. She raised the child alone, never told about his father. I considered her a strong woman, and it fascinated me. When we got married, I accepted her past with my child. But I never loved him. I took care of it, fed it, bought clothes, checked lessons, but I did it out of a sense of duty, not from the heart.

And when she passed away, I allowed myself to tell myself the truth for the first time: he is nobody to me. I didn't have to keep him close. I gave him a month after the funeral, and then he kicked him out. I thought I acted honestly - why torture him and myself? Let him go wherever he wants.

But now, after ten years, the truth overtook me.

I came to the gallery. White hall, paintings on the walls, soft light. There were a lot of people - noise, conversations, glasses of champagne. I felt like a stranger. I walked along the walls, but I didn't see the paintings - I was just waiting. And suddenly I heard a voice behind me:

- You came after all.

I turned around. A tall young man was standing in front of me. It looks like twenty-two to thirty years old. The facial features are painfully familiar - I immediately recognized them. It was him. That same boy. But not a boy anymore. His eyes were still the same adult and cold, but now there was something else in them - strength.

- You... - the words got stuck in my throat.

- Yes, I am, - he said calmly. - That child you kicked out.

I stood, unable to say a word.

He took me to one of the paintings. A house was depicted on it. Our old house. The one where my wife and I lived and where I kicked him out. Every detail is a fence, a roof, even a window in his room. But the house was depicted in gloomy colors, as if it was burning from the inside.

- This is my first canvas, - he said. - I painted it when I was sixteen. When I was sleeping at the station.
⁠
My heart swent down.

He continued calmly, almost coldly:

- I lived on the street. I was starving. I was stealing food. I was beaten. But I survived. Then there was a shelter. Then art school. People who helped me. I went ahead because I had no choice. And now... I have my own gallery.

He said it without pride. Just as a fact.

I stood there, feeling everything collasing inside.

- Why... - I squeezed out. - Why did you call me here?

He looked at me. His gaze was as sharp as a knife.

- For you to see. So that you understand who you lost. Just so you know: I survived without you. I became what I became, not thanks to you, but in spite of you.

I couldn't stand it. For the first time in ten years, something broke in me.

- I'm sorry... - I whispered. - Forgive me.

He was silent.

I wanted to touch his shoulder, but he took a step back.

- I don't need your forgiveness, - he said quietly. - And you don't need mine too. I've been forgiven for a long time, because otherwise I couldn't live. But there is nothing between us. You are nothing to me.

These words struck more painfully than any curse.

I left the gallery, staggering as if after a serious illness. There was a cold wind outside, but I couldn't feel it. There was an emptiness inside me, which was now filled with only one thing - the realization that I myself destroyed my life. I lost a son who could have been mine. I pushed him away when he needed me the most. I thought I had done the right thing, that I had freed myself from someone else's burden. But now I realized: it was on that day that I deprived myself of the only chance to be a father.

I lived my life, building a business, buying an apartment, surrounding myself with convenience. But all this is dust. Because in an instant I realized: all I wanted was to turn back time.

But you can't turn back time.

After the meeting in the gallery, I couldn't recover for several days. He tossed around at night, remembering his look. He was a stranger, but at the same time the same blood of my wife, her character, her strength lived in him. I suddenly realized: all my life I had been hiding from this look, because it reminded me of my betrayal.

I began to dig into myself, remembering what I diligently erased from my memory. The day I told him, ""Get out."" His footsteps in the corridor, silence outside the door. I told myself then that I did the right thing, that I freed myself. But now every sound, every image came back with such force that I wanted to scream.

I became interested in his past. I found out through acquaintances, asked questions in shelters. It turned out that he really lived on the street for a long time. The first months after I kicked him out, he wandered around the stations. He slept on benches, in abandoned houses. Sometimes he was let into the entrances, but more often he was driven out. He ate the waste from the garbage cans. He was beaten several times by older teenagers. He didn't have a single person to turn to.

I sat with these stories and felt like I was suffocated by wine. It was a child to whom I had to become a support. My wife's child is the woman I once loved the most. And I left it as if it were an unnecessary thing.

He said in an interview (I found an article about him, the artist) that for the first time he tried to draw on pizza boxes that he found on the street. An old pencil, fragments of crayons. He drew everything he saw around him: the faces of people at the station, cats, the light of lanterns, his own pain. The drawing was his way to survive. Then some volunteer noticed him, helped him get him to a shelter, and from there - to an art school.

I read it and understood: all this time he fought alone. At that time, I was sitting in a comfortable chair in my apartment and thinking how good it was that I got rid of the burden.

When we met in the gallery, I wanted to say something, but the words got stuck in my throat. Everything I squeezed out was pathetic: ""Forgive me."" But how can you forgive what I did?

He said, ""You are nothing to me."" And it was true. I deprived myself of the right to be called his father.

After the gallery, I tried to contact him again several times. I wrote letters, left messages through people who knew him. There was no answer. He ignored me. And I understood that it was fair.

But one day, a few months later, I received a call again. This time it was him. His voice was calm, almost emotionless.

- I thought we could meet. Once. There will be no more.

We met in a cafe. He was sitting opposite, drinking black coffee. I noticed that he held himself confidently, calmly, and this hurt me the most. He wasn't a child looking for support. He became an adult, strong, independent. And I'm an old man who lost everything

- Why did you agree to meet? - I asked.

- To say what I didn't say in the gallery, - he replied. - I don't hold a grudge against you. If I lived with this hatred, I would break down. But you should know: I often wondered why? Why did you get rid of me so easily?

I was silent. Everything was shrinking inside me.

- I was afraid, - I finally said. - I didn't love you. I didn't feel the connection. When your mother died, I was left alone, and it seemed to me that I didn't have to pull someone else's child. I was selfish. I was thinking only about myself.

He listened silently.

- And now, - I continued, - I realize that this was the worst mistake in my life.

He put down the cup.

- Mistake? - he asked softly. - It's not a mistake. It's a choice. You did it consciously. And this choice cost me my childhood.

These words pierced me through. I lowered my eyes.

We sat in silence. Then he said:

- I gave you a chance to see who I have become. But not because I wanted to prove something to you. And because I wanted to prove it to myself. That I'm stronger than what you did to me.

I wanted to say something else, but he got up.

- We won't meet again, - he said calmly. - Live your life.

And left.

I sat for a long time, looking into his empty cup. I wanted to catch up with him, stop him, but I understood: he was right. There is nothing between us. I myself destroyed this bridge ten years ago.

Since then, I've been living like in a fog. I have money, business, a woman next to me. But all this became meaningless. I look at people with children and think: I could be a father. I could be proud of my son. I could hold him by the shoulder and say, ""This is my boy."" But I don't have it. And it will never happen.

I often go to his galleries. I don't show up, I hide among the visitors. I look at his paintings. They have pain, darkness, but also light. He learned to turn his pain into art. And I'm only in regret.

I understand that the only thing I have left is a memory. And with this memory I will live out my days.

Sometimes I dream that one day he will come to me himself. He'll say, ""I forgive you. I'm ready to give you a chance."" But I know it's just a dream. In reality, he will never come back.

And every day I wake up with one thought: if I could turn back time. But time doesn't turn. It only goes forward, leaving behind what you have done.

And my cross is to live with it to the end.

When I kicked him out, I thought he would go to some friends, maybe to his mother's neighbors or acquaintances. I had no idea that he was actually left alone in this huge and cold world. His first days after his exile were pure hell. He walked around the city aimlessly, holding a bag that seemed to him the only anchor. It had a pair of T-shirts, a sweater and a shabby math textbook.

At first, he spent the night in the stairwells. But he was cast out - adults did not want to see someone else's teenager in their entrance. Sometimes he slept at the station, hiding from the guards. I looked for food in the urns, collected the leftovers. For a twelve-year-old child, it was a humiliation that cannot be conveyed in words. But he was silent. Didn't cry. Just survived.

One evening he tried to steal a bun from a kiosk. The seller noticed, grabbed his hand, and started screaming. He was beaten by some man, passers-by dispersed, no one stood up. From that day on, he realized that in this world you can only rely on yourself.

It got worse in winter. Frost, dampness, constant hunger. He coughed, got sick, but still went to the stations, collected empty bottles to hand over and get a few coins. Sometimes I worked part-time by helping loaders. No one was interested in where he was from, who his parents were.

On one of these nights, when he was almost unconscious from fatigue and cold, he was noticed by a female volunteer. She distributed food to the homeless and paid attention to a thin teenager with huge eyes. She took him to the shelter.

It was not easy in the shelter. The children there were different - someone was aggressive, someone was already used to stealing and fighting. But he stood apart. Silent, wary, with a shadow in his eyes. He started drawing. First with a pencil on old notebook sheets, then with paints brought by volunteers. He drew everything he experienced: bridges, railway stations, cold streets. And faces. The faces of people who passed by him without noticing.

Once his drawings were noticed by a teacher from an art school. He said, ""You have talent. You see what others don't see."" This man helped him get into school. There the boy felt for the first time that his pain could be turned into something more.

Years have passed. He grew, changed. New shades appeared in his paintings - first darkness, then light. His works began to be noticed. First at small exhibitions, then in large halls. By the age of twenty, he already had a name. But along with this name, he wore a scar that I left.

When I saw him in the gallery ten years later, he was a different person. Adults, confident. I was broken. I realized that it was I who threw him into the hell he went through. I ruined his childhood. I deprived him of his mother's home, although it was the only piece of warmth he had left.

After our last meeting in a cafe, I couldn't find a place for a long time. I wanted to redeem my guilt, but I understood that there would be no redemption. I wrote him letters that I never sent. In every letter I asked for forgiveness again and again, explained that I was a coward, that I was afraid of someone else's responsibility. But then he tore these letters - because he understood: he didn't need them.

I often went to his galleries secretly. He stood among people who admired his works and looked at the paintings. He himself was in them - his pain, his loneliness, his surviving heart. I saw canvases depicting the railway stations where he once slept. I saw pictures with empty eyes of a child sitting in the corner. And it seemed to me that this child was looking straight at me.

Sometimes I cried there, in the crowd, but no one noticed.

Years passed. I'm getting old. Business brought money, but it didn't mean anything anymore. The woman I lived with got tired of my shadow and left. Friends left, everyone had a family, children, grandchildren. I didn't have anyone. Only emptiness and memories.

I found out that he went abroad. His exhibitions were opened in Paris, Berlin, New York. His paintings were sold for a lot of money. He became famous. He was called the artist of pain and light. And I was just an old man who once kicked him out of the house.

Once I made up my mind. I came to him for an exhibition abroad. He was standing in the hall, hiding among the audience. And suddenly I noticed him. He walked along the paintings, discussed something with journalists. I wanted to come over, but I couldn't. His face was calm, confident, and I realized: he has his own life, in which there is no place for me.

I left.

I haven't tried it since then. I realized: my punishment is to live and know that I have lost the most important thing. I destroyed the only connection that connected me with my wife. I pushed away her son, and with him her memory.

Now I'm alone. In the evenings, I sit in an empty apartment, looking at old photos of the three of us. I see him as a little boy next to his mother. His smile, which he never gave me. And I understand that this smile could be mine too. I could be his father. I could be there when it was hard for him. But I decided to leave him.

And now I have no right to forgiveness.

I'm getting older, and every day brings me closer to the end. But even death won't be a liberation for me. Because there are things that are impossible to forget. And I know: somewhere deep down my wife looks at me reproachingly. She entrusted me with the most precious thing - her child. And I betrayed her trust.

All I want now is to turn back time. But time doesn't turn. It goes forward, leaving you with your actions.

I do talk A LOT, but nobody's perfect, right?

Now I'm 27, I have a partner (he's the best person in the whole wide universe I'll tell you that) but sometimes I wished I had that ride or die friend whom I can call that's just like ""Yeah, pms am I right?"" and I would be like ""Hell yeah! Damn pms!"" and just talk about everything. A friendship based on support and trust, you know? 

I was so social back then, just to eventually lose trust in people and now I'm just kind of socially awkward and wouldn't even be able to build a friendship even if I wanted to.",1,1756927622.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1n7od73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7od73,NPD - Coffee Shop Pedals London Fog Tape Delay,"Here's one you don't see everyday.  

I make weird music and have a (un)healthy delay addiction.  I went looking for a new delay, as I enjoy doing from time to time.  In an effort to support Canadian small builders I went looking specifically for something unusual from the Great White North and stumbled upon Coffee Shop Pedals out of Saskatoon.

I've been messing with it for a week now, and am quite happy with it.  Gives you multiple tape settings, those being clean, slightly worn, completely worn and multi-head delays.  Has the usual delay controls, plus some others like playback speed that lets you adjust the bit rate like a Mood's clock control (and has the same effect on delay time as the Mood's clock does) and a single control to set the parameters for each mode.

It can go from warm subtle slightly worn tape sounds to mangled destroyed bit crushed chaos.  Can do sound on sound if you crank the repeats; messing with controls and settings while in infinite repeat mode gives a nice range of crazy psychedelic tones and noises.  Tap tempo works well, and holding the tap ramps the playback speed knob to a preset (and programmable) position - out of the box it moves the knob down to give that excellent melting-tape-slowdown effect that is a ton of fun to break out at the end of a song.  It has MIDI capabilities, but I haven't hooked it up to my MIDI rig yet.  It's also stereo, and sounds incredible in stereo when I hooked it up to my recording set up.  The multi-head delay especially produces amazing and inspiring rhythmic sequences in stereo (works in mono too, but really takes on a life of it's own in stereo).

On my noise/recording board I set it up after my Blooper so I could drive it with some looped sounds and then manually tweak it before it goes into other downstream delays.  Worked exactly as I had hoped.  Next steps are to set it up on the stereo part of that board and add it to the MIDI chain so it'll obey the master clock.

Lush and musical, I think it's a pretty fun delay and I'm excited to explore more Coffee Shop Pedals devices in the future.",6,1756927593.0,basspedals,2,1.0,False

In-Depth Review,"The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT Coffee Brewer in polished silver is a machine that has seen almost daily use on my kitchen counter since I got my hands on it. As someone who can't imagine mornings without coffee, I took this drip coffee maker on a test ride, preparing everything from weekday morning pick-me-ups to lazy Sunday brews. The experience turned out to be delightful, yet it was not devoid of quirks.

**Timeless Design and Robust Build Quality**

What struck me immediately about this coffee brewer was its polished silver finish and minimalist yet modern design. If you're like me and appreciate a touch of class in your kitchen appliances, this one checks that box. Additionally, its sturdy construction and thoughtful build reflect the Dutch craftsmanship it's famed for. While the design is a visual treat, the stainless steel thermal carafe is as functional as it is pleasing to the eye. It keeps coffee hot without ruining the flavor—a godsend when you're multitasking.

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b002s4di2s/)

**Performance and Brewing Experience**

The quality of coffee this machine delivers is its major selling point. Thanks to the pre-immersion drip system, which ensures a perfect coffee bloom, even a novice coffee enthusiast can enjoy café-quality pouring. I was amazed that it could brew 40 ounces of coffee in just about six minutes. Speed doesn’t compromise taste either! The natural pulse action produces a blend that's smooth yet punchy. However, it's worth noting you’ll need to tinker with the grind size and coffee amount to find your perfect cup—a bit of trial and error involved.

**Good Points**

- Intuitive one-button operation simplifies daily use.  
- Brews an entire pot of coffee (40 oz) in under 6 minutes.  
- The stainless steel carafe preserves heat and taste well.  
- Backed by an impressive 5-year warranty for peace of mind.  

**What It Lacks**

While I truly appreciate the craftsmanship, I wouldn't say the experience was free of frustrations.  

- The manual adjust brew basket can be tricky to use effectively.  
- The machine is relatively large and takes up considerable counter space.  
- Replacing parts like the brew basket lid could be tedious.  

**Competing Brands**

When comparing this coffee brewer to other models, its closest challengers are the Breville Precision Brewer and the Cuisinart DGB-900BC. The Breville offers adjustable temperature control, which is a feature noticeably absent in this Technivorm model. However, the Technivorm stands out for its simplistic yet reliable operations. On the other hand, the Cuisinart comes with a built-in grinder, making it perfect for those who love freshly ground coffee. But here's the thing—the taste in the Technivorm brew is significantly better, to my palate.

**Bang for the Buck**

This coffee maker is a bit of an investment. Yet, with its reliability, handmade construction, and top-notch brewing results, it feels worth the splurge—especially for coffee aficionados who believe in paying for quality. But, for casual drinkers, the cost may feel steep. Regular users will agree that the durability and five-year warranty alone provide long-term value.

We’re pretty bad at accurate estimations. Look at your screen time. Isn’t it surprising how many hours you have there? It’s like a full-time job.

Small behaviors (good and bad) are easy to ignore, but they do compound; even 2 drinks a day can harm your sleep.

Let’s say you make it a habit to go on your phone before you sleep, you drink a cup of coffee a bit later in the day, then you eat a little bit late, and let’s *sprinkle in* some sleeping in on the weekends.

Now, suddenly, your sleep is *somehow* bad.

It’s hard to confront this, but maybe you don’t know how bad it is?

You can simply track it; it takes 5 minutes a day. At least you’ll get an objective lens to what’s happening:

* When did you put the phone away? Was it at least 30 minutes before bed?
* When was your last meal? Was it at least 3 hours before bed?
* How many cups of coffee did you drink today? Is it less than 4?
* Do you take any medication? How about substances?
* How many drinks did you have today? Is it less than 2?

Do it for one week, just *one week*.

Look at the data, how many “no” did you get? Is it bad?

Good, then work to get the basics right.

(If you don’t know the basics of sleep hygiene, then see the CDC’s ""about sleep""; it’s easy to digest.)

When you do, and your sleep doesn’t get better, then go see a doctor.

At this point, the cause needs a professional eye at this point: it could be the humidity in your room, sleep apnea, hormonal imbalances, or some side effect of your medication.

It’s a hassle booking a doctor’s appointment just to be told to eat healthy, drink less, and exercise.

I am currently struggling with whether to take my dog to the vet again and would like the advice. The dog in question is a pure bred German Rottweiler named Hela.

As to what happened, my little sister, apparently, left a Mr. Clean Magic eraser out on the floor last night and everyone besides for me fell asleep, but no one put her in her crate like she's meant to be until I decided to go to bed hours later (which is okay, there's usually not magic eraser in the floor and it's my responsibility anyways)

Well, we wake up the next morning and there's pieces of magic eraser torn up in the floor, as well as vomit everywhere (both inside and outside the crate). My mother has to rush to get my sisters to school and I'm still asleep, so no one really looks at it until she wakes me up later to clean it with her.

It's blood. Coffee grounds, tinged red, took pictures. Vets agreed it was blood. The dog is acting entirely normal (no drooling, wanted to eat which we didn't allow, ect)

So we take her to urgent care and they do an ultrasound—she's okay, they say. She only has some ulcers which we're going to give her medication for and her stomach is empty. Monitor her and we'll hope she passes it through.

They gave her a few medications that I don't remember and can't find out right now (I'm at college), but the biggest one is Cerenia, which they gave her there. The vet said if she vomits while on Cerenia, take her in immediately.

And my mother has texted me telling me that she's worried, the dog has projectile vomited six times in 45 minutes, and oh it looks like there's magic eraser in it. So I just called her and said when I get home, we'll take her to the vet (We can't just go right now without leaving children stranded at school).

She tells me it's ultimately my decision because it's my dog, but she doesn't think it's necessary yet because our dog gets sick all the time, even if you only change her food from puppy to dog food. We'll just keep watching her.

Is that a bad decision? Should I put my foot down? We truly don't have that much money, but we all love her to death.",7,1756927020.0,AskVet,12,0.89,False

The braid is loose again. I tug at the end, but my fingers fumble, they always did when you weren’t there to nudge my elbow and say Slow down, silly. Your hands moved like whispers through my hair, weaving marigolds and something purple you’d plucked from the ditch behind our old school. ""See?"" you’d say, securing the stem with a rubber band smuggled from the maths teacher’s desk. ""Now you don’t look like an idiot."" I’d roll my eyes, but my chest would swell. You made crowns feel possible

I’m in Delhi now and here, Outside my window, traffic bleeds: a relentless, metallic herd. No ditches here. No marigolds choking the edges of football fields. Just concrete, and the smell of exhaust thick as guilt. I promised we’d meet before Ipa’s transfer tore me away. Now, I feel ashamed that I am safe here in Delhi, while many of you are still in Kangleipak. After the rains, we whispered under that tree, pinkies knotted. We’ll find that cave near Sekmai River. You laughed, ""Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks?"" Especially then, I said. Like the shared chowmein at Dingku’s stall, half-spicy for you, no onions for me. Like the way we’d press our thumbs together after tests. Honestly Henny, I never see us as different. What is a Kuki or a Meitei?

I still miss you a lot. The news of you, came, I think around Tuesday. Delhi’s air conditioning hummed like a trapped bee. Clashes intensify, the anchor said. Casualties reported in Churachandpur. I didn’t flinch. Casualties were shapes, not faces. Not your face, tilted back mid-laugh as you tried to balance on the monsoon-slicked wall behind school. Then Ima’s voice, tight as a wire: ""Henny’s gone."" No. The word was a stone in my throat. I swear it was a lie. Weren’t you with your relatives in Mizoram? Please say it is wrong. My cousin had shown me a blurry photo on the screen that he got from whatsapp, a boy’s body curled near a burnt-out jeep. Not yours, I thought. Definitely cannot be yours. Your smile was too bright for shadows.

I remember the last market day before I left. Your mother sold woven baskets near Ima Keithel. You tugged me through the crowd, past stalls smelling of dried fish and ginger. A Meitei vendor spat at your feet. You froze. I saw your knuckles whiten. Then you breathed out, slow as river mud. ""Uncle,"" you said, voice clear, ""My friend here loves your eromba. Extra maroi, yes?"" The man blinked. Nodded. As we walked away, you squeezed my hand. ""Hate is lazy,"" you murmured. ""Like copying homework."" I laughed, but you didn’t. Your eyes were old that day.

Now they tell stories. Meitei mobs burned Kuki homes. Kuki snipers picked off valley boys from the hills. They show videos: women naked, bleeding. Meitei? Kuki? The screen makes them all look like broken dolls. I vomited after the first one. Delhi debates ""ethnic tensions"" on primetime TV. Tribal land rights, they say. Scheduled Tribe status. Words like knives, sharpened far away in rooms smelling of coffee and power. Did you know, Henny? Did you care? Or did you just miss our algebra test that Tuesday?

My birthday cake had fifteen candles yesterday. Ima sang. Ipa clapped. I did not wish to celebrate without you. I closed my eyes, wishing for the cave’s damp darkness. For your elbow jabbing my ribs: Make a real wish! What wish is left? That Meitei mothers didn’t hide petrol bombs in rice sacks? That Kuki fathers didn’t teach sons to load rifles? That Delhi hadn’t directed Manipur to shut off the internet for 80 days so the world wouldn’t see you die.

New Delhi’s silence was indeed the cruelest magic. For weeks, no internet, no help: just more soldiers watching while Meiteis and Kukis slaughtered each other. Modi ji finally spoke when those videos of Kuki women paraded naked went viral. Shamed India, he said. But where was his shame when your people were killed? Or when Meitei boys were butchered in Tengnoupal? When places of worship were vandalised? I especially hate those in the mainland, in quest of their hegemony to make us northeastern's submit to them, they fueled us with lies: Meiteis yelling illegal immigrants! as if our ancestors did not live together under the glorious kingdom of Kangleipak.

Well Henny, if by any miracle you read this, I want to let you know. I found a marigold in Lodhi Garden. Woven into some bride’s photoshoot, probably. I stole it. Sat on a bench, trying to braid it into my hair. The petals tore. Strands tangled. A security guard eyed me. Crazy girl, his stare said. Let him stare. I want to weave our rebellion, Henny. One clumsy braid at a time. Against the lies that we were ever just Meitei or Kuki. Against the silence that thinks 258 bodies are a ""situation,"" not a screaming wound.

The flower falls. I let it go. Somewhere, the Sekmai still flows: carrying ash, carrying blood, carrying the weight of two friends. I’ll find it, Henny. Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks. Especially then.

Henny, you might have left me. You might have broken our childhood promise to grow up together, and to always be by each other’s side. In all honesty, I had a massive crush on you, and well I still do. But perhaps, maybe perhaps, our friendship was the biggest rebellion against the state. I am proud of that. However till then, I still ask:

Why did you leave me? The question claws inside. But the truth writhes uglier: Why did our people choose hatred over children? Why did Delhi look away?

That flower you gave me was more than beauty, Henny. It was a bridge. And I’ll wear its ghost until my hands remember how to build new ones.

Yours Truly,

Lychee as you used to call me

1n7nzic,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1n7nzic/new_job_opportunity_but_unsure_if_its_worth_it/,New job opportunity but unsure if it's worth it,"
So I just had an interview this morning, this is after I've had 65 + applications put in, only my second interview I've had. 

It went well I have a second interview on Friday. 

But I got some of the more in-depth information on this job and I don't know if it's worth the risk. It's a company that works marketing for nonprofits, they go door to door and set up booths to get repeat and single donations for the nonprofits assigned to them. But base pay is only $9 an hr. The interviewer specified that as long as I get 10 donations a day I could make $18 an hr, if I get more donations I could go up to the equivalent of $28/hr. 

My issue is, I've never done sales or marketing before, this is completely new territory for me. I can be a people person but idk if it's worth the risk of only making $375 a week. I figure I can pick up morning shifts at a coffee shop near me, but I'm already struggling to make it by at my current job ($500 a week) 

I asked my aunt about it, she's my go to person for all life things, and she said to take the risk, at this point anything is better than where I'm at now and to get an application in to the coffee shop near me as well. But I wanted to see what other people thought, if you've worked a job like this and if it's going to be a flop or if I could make good money with it?

Tldr new job, base pay only $375 a week, potential to make upwards of $720-$1,120 a week if I can get donations. But not sure if it's worth the risk, never done sales or marketing jobs before, and have no idea how many people actually donate to these sorts of things.

1n7nymh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n7nymh/i_31f_met_someone_32m_while_temporarily_working/,"I (31F) met someone (32M) while temporarily working abroad, and things got serious fast. What happens when I have to leave?","So I (31F) went on a blind date a few weeks ago, set up by a mutual friend who swore we'd click. I went in with fairly low expectations, just looking to get back out there and maybe have a nice evening. But wow... it turned out to be one of **those** dates. He (32M) was wonderful in every way: charming, kind, smart, funny and incredibly handsome. It was the kind of date where you lose track of time, you’re laughing nonstop, and by the end you’re already texting each other “I had a really great time!” 

Since then, things have kind of exploded. In the best way, but also in a slightly overwhelming way. We’ve seen each other almost every day since that first date. Sometimes it’s something small like grabbing a coffee before work, other times it’s dinner or catching a movie or just walking and talking for hours. When we’re not together, we’re texting constantly, from little check-ins to long conversations in between meetings and life stuff. The chemistry is real and the connection feels easy. It’s like we just get each other. I’m definitely catching feelings, fast.

But here’s the kicker... I’m only in this city temporarily for work until the end of September. After that, I go back home, which is a 15-hour flight halfway across the world. We’ve briefly talked about it, but kind of brushed it off with a “let’s just see how things go and deal with it when we get there.” Which is fair, it’s early days. But also… it’s not really early anymore, if that makes sense?

Don't get me wrong, I’m loving this stage. It’s exciting and sweet and makes me feel hopeful in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t also a little scared. Scared that I’m getting attached to someone I might have to leave. Scared that we’re pretending this is simpler than it is. Scared that this amazing love story might have an expiration date I can’t control.

I don’t want to ruin it by overthinking, but I also don’t want to ignore reality, so I’m turning to Reddit. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How do you stay present and enjoy something when there’s a ticking clock in the background? Is it better to have the hard conversation now or wait until it’s closer?

Would love to hear your advice or perspective.


TL;DR:
I had an amazing blind date about a month ago that quickly turned into a deep connection, but I'm only in this city until the end of September, which is when I fly back home—halfway across the world. Unsure whether to enjoy it while it lasts or have the tough long-distance talk now.

My psychiatrist and therapist are in the loop and my parents drove me home so we are all good. I am not at the office. I graduated from college with a business degree three years ago. I’ve been working really hard at a big job in insurance and I’ve been really nervous about doing well with people around me all in their 30s and 40s with more experience than me. I have bipolar disorder but I manage it really well I think with my medication’s and with a therapist. This morning I accidentally took the wrong pills out of my case I took my night pills instead of my morning pills, I ended up taking calls as I usually do getting through a meeting with my mentor and processing work as as well as having a department wide meeting. In the department wide meeting, my boss congratulated me and everyone on my team clapped because I won an award for the work I was doing. Now at this point I had realized something was wrong because regardless of the fact that I’ve already had three coffees. I was very very, very tired. I could hardly keep my eyes open because that’s what my night meds do I eventually put two and two together and my parents told me I’d taken the wrong pills out of the case they came and drove and picked me up because obviously it wouldn’t have been safe for me to drive. I’ve never told anyone or disclose professionally that I have bipolar disorder. I still didn’t even fully explain it. I just told my boss I medically needed to go home and that something was off. He understood and just wanted me to take care of myself because thankfully I work with really good people. I went home, but I’m just so frustrated with myself. I feel like an idiot for taking the wrong pills I’m so mad that I missed out on this opportunity to really appreciate And be fully present for people congratulating me. I’ve been so stressed with work and this was supposed to be a good day but now I’m at home beating myself up for being stupid and taking the wrong meds. I’ll be fine and none of my doctors therapist or psychiatrist are worried but has anyone else made this mistake before?

I haven’t had the time or space to truly grieve my uncle—I’ve been avoiding it in my day to day life and even my trip out of state for his memorial was rushed because my workplace is not allowing anyone to take time off right now. But this past week Uncle Jim is all I can think about and today I started feeling really ANGRY. 

While I was at my uncles’ house for the memorial, Jim’s husband showed me the last photo Jim took on his phone—it was of Jim’s swollen finger bitten by a spider that led to his sudden death from septic shock. I have been thinking about how unreal and sudden it has felt, how I kept expecting Jim to come around a corner and playfully scoff at us all during his memorial service, to come out of the kitchen and critique the food his friends so kindly served us all, to joke about the situation the way we do in our family to cope. 

I took my break at work today, and there was a spider in my kitchen and I felt simultaneously scared of being bitten and dying and SO angry! And I spiraled into this train of thought:
“How can a tiny f*cking SPIDER be the reason my Uncle Jim is just GONE? The reason his husband and partner of 19 years is devastated?!! The reason I will never get to hear all Jim’s stories, and his memories of my Dad, and have coffee with him and be driven around his neighborhood on his golf cart as he regales me with the local gossip?!! A F*CKING SPIDER?!!! I HATE THIS!!! HOW DOES SUCH A TINY THING GET TO BLOW A GIANT HOLE IN OUR FAMILY?!!! It’s not fair. I hate it. I HATE IT. JIM would hate it. It’s so beneath him. A SPIDER!!! You know what—JIMMY HATES IT TOO AND DIDN’T want to leave us, so give HIM back!!!!”

The spider in my kitchen is dead, and I will be looking around for any others I may have missed. I am currently still sobbing off and on at my desk as I work from home and appreciate to chance to vent here.

This is not my first time in Vietnam, but it is my first time in Da Nang, and I am wondering how everyone really feels about what is going on in this town. I think I can imagine what it might have been like a decade ago or so and how it became the booming tourist hotspot, but I can't help but feel like I'm seeing a beautiful place at the exact moment that it is in danger of being lost to overtourism and sexpats. I would imagine that if my family were from here and I were forced to live in the middle of it, I might not be so happy.

Da Nang is being marketed as a place to find a tranquil escape. So far, my experience hasn't felt like much of that. There seems to be just as many foreigners as anyone who looks Vietnamese, there is an insane amount of construction sites resulting in unwalkable streets and crazy noise pollution, and the streets without construction seem to be covered in trash half the time.

Then, the sex tourism is apparently exploding, and all the grab drivers seem to be in on a sex trafficking scheme? As a single white dude, all I was trying to do my first night here was pick up some things from a store at around 8:00 p.m., and I lost count of how many grab drivers outright harassed me trying to sell me women. It had to have been around 7 or 8 of them within 10 minutes, and one of them driving down the main road close to the beach even slammed on the brakes of his scooter to pull over and ask me if I wanted a woman or drugs, and almost none of them took no for an answer and just left me alone.

The food has been amazing, but everything else has honestly felt kind of exhausting, yet I see people on this sub and and overhear foreigners in coffee shops talking about how much they love it here, all while I feel crazy because it seems like we arent experiencing the same place at all. I feel like Da Nang is a couple of years away from being Cartagena, Colombia or perhaps Cancun, Mexico, which is to say that it is about to be overrun with nothing but prostitutes, drug mules, seedy hotels, and passport bros coming here to take advantage of it all.

So I’ve been talking to this woman at my gym for a little while. She’s 35, I’m 28 .She told me she’s planning to get a divorce — she and her husband “mutually agreed,” but she hasn’t filed yet and says she’s still looking for a lawyer.

Today I complimented on her workouts and she asked if i wanted to join,  we actually worked out together (core exercises), and afterwards I asked if she wanted to grab coffee for tommorow. She said *yes*.

Here’s the thing — she’s still married. She even has a kid. I’m not sure if she’s serious about divorcing, or if this is just her way of dipping her toe into something on the side. Part of me is excited she agreed, but another part of me feels like I’m walking into something messy.

Honestly, tomorrow I’m just trying to see how far I can go with this — more to test if she’s actually *down down* — but I don’t actually plan on taking it all the way.

what should I do here? Is meeting her for coffee crossing a line already? Should I back away until she’s actually divorced? Or am I overthinking it?

I destroyed my husband's career because I felt neglected, then had an affair when he became depressed about unemployment I caused.

My husband worked as a project manager at a tech startup. He loved that job more than anything, talked about it constantly. The problem was he worked twelve-hour days and traveled twice a month for client meetings. I felt like his job came first, not our marriage.

So I decided to fix things my way. I called his boss pretending to be a client and complained about his ""unprofessional behavior"" during a meeting that never happened. I sent anonymous emails to HR claiming he was drinking at work and missing deadlines. I even created a fake LinkedIn account and messaged his biggest client saying he'd been badmouthing their company behind closed doors.

It worked better than I expected. They fired him within three weeks.

""I don't understand what happened,"" he kept saying, staring at his termination letter. ""Everything was going so well. The Johnson project was ahead of schedule.""

I told him it was probably office politics, that he was too good for them anyway. ""Maybe this is the universe telling you to spend more time at home,"" I said, rubbing his shoulders.

But instead of being grateful for more time together, he spiraled into depression. Real depression. He'd sit on the couch in his pajamas applying for jobs that never called back. I'd destroyed his reputation in our tight-knit tech community without thinking it through.

He stopped showering regularly, stopped talking to me about anything meaningful. Started drinking beer at noon instead of coffee. When I tried to be romantic, he'd just stare at the TV like I wasn't there.

""You need to snap out of this,"" I told him after two months. ""I can't be married to someone who's given up on life.""

That's when I met my coworker at the company gym. He had energy, ambition, a corner office. We started having coffee after workouts, then drinks after work, then afternoon meetings at a hotel downtown.

The affair lasted four months. My husband found out when my coworker's wife called our house looking for proof.

""Your wife has been sleeping with my husband,"" she told him when he answered. ""I have hotel receipts with your wife's name on them.""

He confronted me that night, holding printouts of credit card statements she'd provided.

I was cornered, so I went on the offensive.

""Maybe if you weren't such a pathetic loser sitting around feeling sorry for yourself, your wife wouldn't need to find a real man,"" I said. ""I needed a partner, not a dependent.""

He just stared at me with this broken expression. ""You did this to me,"" he said quietly. ""You got me fired, didn't you?""

""Prove it,"" I said.

He couldn't then. But six months later, during divorce proceedings, he hired a private investigator. They traced the fake LinkedIn account back to my home computer. Found records of my calls to his office. Even recovered deleted emails I thought were gone forever.

By then I'd already told everyone who would listen that he was lazy and useless. His family, our mutual friends, even our neighbors. I said he'd become an alcoholic who couldn't keep a job, that I'd tried to help but he was beyond saving.

His brother called me crying after the divorce papers were filed. ""What happened to him? He used to be so driven, so happy.""

""Depression changes people,"" I said. ""I couldn't watch him destroy himself anymore.""

But karma works fast in small professional circles. My coworker's wife worked at a PR firm with connections throughout our city's business community. She was furious about the affair and started making phone calls, telling people the real story about what I'd done to my husband.

The story spread through professional networks like wildfire. Someone recorded me at a coffee shop bragging to a friend about how I'd ""handled"" my husband's career problem. The recording went viral on local social media within days.

My company fired me for ""conduct unbecoming of our values."" Every job interview I've had since ends the same way once they google my name. They've heard about me. Nobody wants to hire someone who sabotages their own family.

My husband got hired at a competing firm within three months. His new boss had heard the whole story and respected him for surviving what I'd put him through. He's been promoted twice since then.

I'm living with my parents at thirty-four. My divorce settlement was minimal because of the adultery clause. My reputation in this town is permanently destroyed. People literally cross the street when they see me coming.

My sister says I got exactly what I deserved, that I created a nightmare situation and then blamed everyone else when it backfired on me.

1n7norf,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n7norf/can_petsafe_drinkwell_replacement_carbon_filters/,Can PetSafe Drinkwell Replacement Carbon Filters Improve Your Pet's Water Experience Review?,"Testing out the PetSafe PAC00-13906 Drinkwell Replacement Carbon Filters has been a refreshing addition to my daily routine, especially as a pet owner who values the health and hydration of my furry companions. This 4-pack of filters, specifically designed for PetSafe’s variety of water fountains, ensures my cats and dog always drink clean, filtered water. The added benefit is peace of mind knowing their hydration comes without harmful contaminants or stale tastes.

**Design and Build Quality**  

The first thing I noticed about the filters is their compact size and durable feel. Each carbon filter features a sturdy ceramic material encased in a lightweight, multi-layered design engineered for efficiency. Measuring just about 4 x 2.56 x 4 inches, these filters slip seamlessly into compatible PetSafe models like the Avalon, Pagoda, and Seaside fountains. Their build exudes quality, and since they’re so easy to handle, even my slightly chaotic mornings don’t seem quite as stressful anymore. Who doesn’t love sipping coffee while sliding in a new filter for the pets without hassle?

**Ease of Use**  

Installing the carbon filters into my pet fountains felt almost comically easy. All you have to do is pop the fountain open, remove the old filter, and slide the new one into place. It takes less time than scrolling through TikTok. With longevity ranging from two to four weeks, depending on how much your pets drink, these filters are straightforward to swap in and out. While replacing them might not happen as often as, say, sweeping up pet fur, the relatively low maintenance required is a welcome relief. 

**Check PetSafe PAC00-13906 price on Amazon.**  

**Better Filtration Equals Happier Pets**  

The results of the freshness these filters provide were almost immediate. My dog, who normally sniffs and walks away from average tap water, now eagerly laps up water from his fountain. My cats, who usually behave like they own this planet and are hard to impress, seem equally pleased. The activated carbon, made from coconut shells, removes impurities and odors, leaving behind tastier, fresher water. I did a little test one week by switching back to generic brand filters that claimed to do the same. Let's just say my pets were not amused—they clearly noticed the change in water quality.

**Upsides**  

- The filters hold 50% more activated carbon compared to generic brands, which means noticeably cleaner water.  
- Easy to install and maintain, making life simpler for busy pet owners.  
- Compatible with a wide range of PetSafe fountains, adding versatility.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- The lifespan of two to four weeks feels a bit short for households with multiple drinking pets.  
- They create some mild waste, and I wish PetSafe offered a recycling program for used filters.  

**Performance and Longevity**  

Performance consistency has been a standout feature. I’ve been using this product for a couple of months, testing it under different scenarios—placing the fountains in high-traffic and low-traffic areas of my home, having multiple pets use them concurrently, etc. The filters held up well, providing long-lasting filtration without clogging. That said, if you have a big family of thirsty fur-babies, prepare to burn through the pack of four at a brisk pace.

**Product Comparisons**  

Compared to other options like AmazonBasics pet fountain filters, the superior filtration of this product is evident. Those AmazonBasics filters, while cheaper, didn’t stand up to scrutiny for durability or water freshness over extended use. On the other hand, the Catit carbon filters, another competitor, perform admirably in small pet households but lack the capacity to match the robust water flow provided by PetSafe fountains. This gives the PetSafe Replacement Filters an edge in homes with medium to large pets or multiple users.

**Affordable Quality**  

For the features packed into these filters, they provide solid value, though they're not the cheapest solution. Other brands might tempt you with their lower price, but they generally fail to offer the same reliability and level of water freshness that PetSafe delivers. Factor in the time saved from fewer replacements and better water quality, and these filters feel like the more economical choice in the long run.

Your home needs an update, and you’re ready to invest in a remodel. But your budget might not stretch to do everything at once. That leaves many Phoenix homeowners with a classic dilemma: should we start with the kitchen or the bathroom? It’s a tough call. Both are fantastic ways to add value and seriously improve your day-to-day life. But if you’re thinking about resale value down the line, which one gives you more bang for your buck? Let’s break it down, Arizona style.

For a long time, the kitchen was the undisputed champion of return on investment (ROI). It’s the heart of the home, right? It’s where everyone gathers during parties, where homework gets done, and where that first cup of coffee is brewed. A modern, functional kitchen is a huge selling point. In fact, a minor kitchen remodel can recoup a significant portion of its cost come resale time. Think new countertops, updated appliances, and refreshed cabinet fronts instead of a full gut job with a [remodeling contractor](https://phxhomeremodeling.com/). It makes a massive visual impact without the astronomical price tag.

But don’t count the bathroom out. It’s quietly become a powerhouse in the remodeling world. People are looking for a spa-like retreat right in their own home, especially after the last few years. A dated, cramped bathroom with dodgy tiles can be a real turnoff for potential buyers. Upgrading to a sleek, modern bathroom with a great shower and smart storage solutions not only feels amazing but also offers a stellar ROI, often rivaling that of kitchen projects. It’s a smaller space, so your budget can often go further in terms of high-end finishes.

So, which is it? Well, it kind of depends on your specific situation. If your kitchen is straight out of the 1970s with appliances that barely work, that’s likely your priority. It’s the room that can most dramatically change the entire feel of your house. But if your kitchen is functional and your main bathroom is, well, not, then that bathroom update might be the smarter play for your home’s value.

This is where chatting with a professional remodeling contractor really helps. They can look at your home with an unbiased eye and help you weigh the current state of your rooms against your long-term goals. A team like [Phoenix Home Remodeling](https://phxhomeremodeling.com/) does this all the time. They’re not just builders; they’re advisors who can walk you through the pros and cons specific to your Ahwatukee or Gilbert home. They can even show you 3D renderings of both options so you can see the potential value before making a decision.

Ultimately, the best ROI isn't just about the dollars and cents you might get back when you sell. It’s also about the value you get every single day you live there. The joy of cooking in a beautiful, efficient kitchen or the relaxation of unwinding in a serene master bath? That’s priceless. The key is to work with a remodeling contractor you trust, like Phoenix Home Remodeling, to make a plan that fits your life and your budget, ensuring your investment is a smart one no matter which room you choose first.",1,1756925850.0,ContentCreatorsClub,0,1.0,False

What went well: 

- The style and decor of the hotel is beautiful. 

- The woman at the front desk with long braids was wonderful. She was informative, kind, and relatable.

- The location in the Latin quarter worked well for us. We both really enjoyed the Italian restaurant next door. Great food and service.

- Pre-stay communication from the hotel was great. They shared some helpful recommendations and were very responsive. 

- The balconies and rooftop deck offer nice views of the Eiffel Tower. 

- Their coffee was delicious. 

- There are cute branded chocolates, snacks, waters, etc. available in the room. The smoked almonds were especially good.


What didn't work well:

- We knew this stay was a splurge. Out of the four hotels on our 3 country trip, this was the most expensive, but the value for the money was not worthwhile. 

- We didn't have AC for 24 hours. They didn't tell us that it was broken, so we kept thinking that we weren't using the thermostat correctly. Finally, we called for help and they offered to send up some fans. It was very uncomfortable and annoying that they didn't proactively reach out to us. 

- There is no manual privacy lock on the doors. This ended up being a big issue when the above mentioned fans were delivered. I was on the deck when I heard the for open and there was a man in the room when I turned around. It was extremely unsettling. They said that they knocked, but I didn't hear anything. We felt unsafe for the remainder of the stay realizing there was no way to prevent workers from entering the room.

- There's no full length mirror anywhere in the room. Not a deal breaker, just strange and annoying. 

- The food situation is absolutely ridiculous. They have a daily buffet breakfast for 31euro. It's a sad assortment of pastries, breads, and made to order eggs. Don't do it. There are plenty of local options that are a much better deal. I don't think they have a kitchen at all. It legit might just be a couple of burners. We ate there twice. The first time, they screwed up my order completely. They comped it and redid it. It was still missing an ingredient, but we were in a hurry, so we are and left. 

The second time, we were ignored for a solid 20 minutes. Eventually, the hostess apologized and took our order. But after another 20 minutes or omelets still hadn't arrived so we had to leave. They said it was comped, but we had tickets and didn't budget over an hour for eggs and coffee. They kept apologizing to everyone around us for being so late. The restaurant is tiny. I'm not sure what happened. 

- There are stairs between reception and the elevators. You will be dragging your bags up and down stairs. 

- The soaps and lotions smell awful. If you're on the fence, pack your own. 

- The bar prices are nuts. Even for non-alcoholic. Just be prepared. I think it was around 9 euro for a Coke. 

- The rooms are stylish and well decorated, but they are small and dark.

- The woman worth the long dark straight hair at the front desk was so rude. She was condescending and dismissive. 

- There was a ton of loud construction outside of the windows every day starting early in the morning. 


All in, I wish we would have stayed somewhere different. It might be the right fit for some, it definitely wasn't right for us. ",2,1756925719.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,1.0,False

I’m also trying to stay active, so if you’re into hitting the gym, going for walks along the Charles, or even just casual basketball/Frisbee, I’m down. I’m equally happy with chill hangouts—board games, grabbing a beer, late-night conversations, you name it.

Why I’m posting: I’m looking for more than just acquaintances. I want to build a small circle of people who are genuinely there for each other—whether that’s hyping each other up, exploring the city, or just being someone to text when you need a laugh.

I have my own place with my husband but I went to my parent's house and spent one night to see my younger siblings, we sleep in the same room when I visit as we watch somethings and talk.
I think it was 5am when I woke up, I pretended to be asleep (we have this habit to avoid mom and I find my self still doing it) my brother was sleeping on the sofa when I heard my mom whispering, it felt like hours but it was like 10min, I glansed behind me and I saw her standing by him bending over and whispering over his head, I head some words like ""she is horrible I can't stand her"" I believe is about me. I stayed still till she left for work and I go to my brother to find him dead sleep, he is a very heavy sleeper and he would say affirmative words like "" yeah/ ok/ great"" and never remembers that someone talked to him, when we were kids I used this to take his stuff and ask for his permission while he was sleeping and tease him about it the next day that he said I can take it, it was never something serious. 

few hours later I woke him up took him and my other little sibling for breakfast and coffee, I kept asking him what was mom whispering to him that early, he said he didnt wake up and no one talked to him, he kept saying how he fell asleep around 4 and doesnt remember anything.

this scared me, so I had to ask him another difficult question ""did my mom convince you some things she said/did never happened and that you imagined it?"" 
I thought she did it only to me since she hated me for acting out ( I took care of her during her cancer treatment that she fully recovered from years ago, and was the second mother to my siblings, the little one used to call me mom when she was a toddler as I was the active mom in her life, I was 14 yrs old. 

He told me he suspected this manipulation tactic of hers only recently, that she has been driving aunt and uncle crazy, dad always confirmed anything mom says, they support each other's abusive behaviors. 
2 years ago, I had the first fight with my cousin who tried to tell me mom is lying, I couldnt believe someone would do these things, to this day, I still thought of a small chance that im mistaken.
our uncle who has a heart failure, while working hard to save money for his kids as doctors said he will not live long, recently blocked mom everywhere, despite everything bad she is saying about aunt and uncle, they have always been nothing but so kind to us and to everyone in their lives, I believe uncle like my cousin and me, couldnt handle my mom's abuse anymore.
now she complains everyday how selfish and horrible of a dad, brother and son he is, totally disregarding the fact that he might pass away at any moment.. 
I was sitting next to grandma not long ago, when mom started whispering ""I cant believe your son didnt call you how many days have you been at my place, omg he doesnt care about you at all isnt he, what an ungrateful son, his mom is sick and he should at least call you to check up on you or come visit you"" 
mind you this is her sick brother, they take turns having grandma in their place not to leave her alone, as she is not in good shape. 
she does this to every person in her life, sometimes with anger screaming and saying the worst things imaginable, sometimes in a sweet appear to be caring voice like with grandma.

I moved with my husband to the other side of our country, I visit twice a year to take my siblings to my place for the vacation, sometimes it ends up being a nightmare with screaming and crying because I visited my cousin behind her back.
this time dad told me he will disown me if he finds out I visited my uncle..

Im not scared of my mom anymore, I dont have any love or empathy for her, people tell me you should feel sorry for her its a mental illness, but she doesnt deserve it, she is the reason for the mental struggle of anyone who is close to her. I cant stop crying because I see the damage my parents did in my siblings psych, its so difficult to find a good physcologist or therapist in a middle eastern country with the religion affecting how doctors see their patients and project their ideas on them as its best for patiabt to forgive parents and suck it up its what god wants...

The smoky bars, the neon light
And I don't mind the mess you leave
But baby, do you ever breathe?
You say I rise before the sun
Like life is something to outrun
But peace don’t only come undone
At 3 A.M., my love
Is that really enough?

You say the dark feels just like home
And chase your thoughts where shadows roam
But there's a calm in waking slow
You’d know if you’d just stay

I take my tea with lemon bright
I sleep in linen, soft and white
Still sweet, I stay
Still sweet, I stay
You dream of fire and whiskey neat
But sugar’s strong and bittersweet
Still sweet, I stay
Still sweet, I stay

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You say you aim for low and true
But love can lift and steady you
I don’t need you to change your pace
But you don’t have to run this race
You kiss like storms and disappear
But I’ve held more than fleeting fear
And if I’m “heaven’s gate,” my dear
Then maybe you’re the key
If you’d just look at me

I won’t pretend to crave the haze
But I’ll meet you in your quiet ways
You can be wild, I’ll still stay brave
And sweet, all the same

So pour your whiskey, chase your song
But don’t say I don’t belong
Still sweet, I stay
Still sweet, I stay
You take your coffee black and deep
But there’s warmth even when I weep
Still sweet, I stay
Still sweet, I stay

Loved Choo Freeman's name as a kid

Have an odd recollection from high school of watching MLB Tonight talk about Guilder Rodriguez's late September debut for the 60something win Rangers after a 10+ year minor league career and how emotional it was for him and his family. Pretty sure he got the game winning RBI that day too. Struck a chord for me

Saw Matt Clark's first big league homer in 2014 live. He vanished after that September cup of coffee

Was present for (watched on the TV in line for concessions) Seth Mejias-Brean's first big league homer in 2019. He had enormous hands and my girlfriend thought he looked like Waluigi

Sean Lowe pitched 8 innings of 1 run ball at my first ever MLB game. Jose Canseco hit 2 homers that day too

David Manning started for the Brewers the first time I ever went to Miller Park (my favorite team and park) in 2003. He got shelled and he never made it back to the bigs

See explanation for Choo Freeman as it is the same for Tike Redman

I remember Scott Carroll being an old rookie that threw a gem in his debut, outdueling prime David Price and the Rays. He was a very below average 5th starter the rest of the year and only made it back briefly the following 2 years",5,1756925393.0,mlb,8,0.73,False

1n7ndh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDrelationships/comments/1n7ndh0/as_we_split_things_i_notice/,"As we split, things I notice","So I got dumped by my CPTSD partner (we’re cis/hetero, btw) about 6 weeks ago and we’re still in the same house. He’s packing and should be out by the end of this month, but in the time together since the official end of our relationship, I have noticed some things I thought might be helpful to share with others, especially those who aren’t sure about staying in the relationship...

First, everything for him is a crisis. **Ev-er-y-thing**. If the dog eats something (harmless!) off the ground on their walk, tragedy. If the shower diverter sticks (as it does, regularly, if one does not clean it correctly and often), horror, with much loud cursing and yelling. Spill coffee because the lid was open and it accidentally got knocked by him? Throw out the thermos in a rage because it doesn’t work right/leaks (it doesn’t). Blood sugars wonky and stomach a mess? Couldn’t be because he chose to live on Doritos and diet Gatorade. It’s truly exhausting just to watch, even without the previous stepping in and trying to fix/help/clean up. 

Worse yet, often these “crises"" are self-inflicted, but he is incapable of seeing that, much less accepting responsibility or learning from it. It’s someone else’s fault, in his mind. This includes the breakup itself. He has told me, over and over, that I made him do this. It is all my fault. 

But this holds true for pretty much everything in his life. His truck needed maintenance and he didn’t have a ride… did he ask for a ride from me or a neighbor or anyone? Nope. He couldn’t because he decided I would say “no” (in fact, I ended up offering) and the neighbors aren’t talking to him any more (they are—I’ve seen it) and technology hates him so he couldn’t use a ride-sharing app (there is still a thing called a phone and taxis and mass transit…). 

His current major-major crisis is pretty much everything connected with the move itself. Instead of getting a new place, moving there, and then deciding what to do with his new life, he has decided to put most of his stuff in storage, pack the rest in his truck, take the dog, and go….somewhere. He might visit a step-sibling in the Tahoe area. I have heard of this person once in our 10 years together so, um, okay. Then, he may go further north, to see if he’d like to live there (we live in SoCal). He hates the cold, btw. Vehemently. 

He expects to be traveling for months. His business that was just getting off the ground? The one we worked for together (a long apprenticeship to get qualified). He’s essentially quit. He’s got money (a hefty inheritance) so he can afford to do this, but at the same time he complains about having to spend money...

I am taking over the mortgage on the house. I have no inheritance to live off—I just have to continue to work (also self-employed) and give up on the idea of a retirement. Money will be tight. Sucks but that’s life and I have chosen to try and keep the house as I love my neighbors, and being here. My choice and I am responsible for the outcome.

But for him? It’s a tragedy that he is being forced to spend all this money to pack and store his belongings and take a months-long travel experience to find a place to live where he will (magically) be happy.

In short, he is spinning and running. And tantrumming often. And making poor decisions. It’s awful to watch. I love this man, even though he’s been a really not-good partner for a while (because of the CPTSD); but I must stay out of his circus. My therapist thinks it’s likely that he’s going to crash and burn at some point—I need to be ready for that to happen and must not intervene. No saving him. That is super hard. 

At least he says he will keep doing therapy via video. Thank the gods. I don’t understand why his therapist hasn’t said “Dude, you’re not thinking clearly…maybe slow down and look at some of your choices…” but I’m not her nor am I a therapist. Maybe she has—although he said she fully supports his “plan.” I can’t help but wonder if this isn’t more of him hearing what he wants to hear, not what is really being said. 

From what I read, what he is doing is pretty typical of someone with serious and (mostly) untreated CPTSD. He’s still in the victim mindset and, until that shifts, he’s not likely to make great improvements. I waited for that to happen and would still be waiting, if he didn’t flip out and end us. But none of us can do that work for our partners. They have to do their own work. 

And we have to let them.

As for me, I have been getting on with life, as best I can. As the Buddhists say: chop wood, carry water. That is, no matter what happens in life, you need to do what you need to do. I have friends who have been supportive and am trying to take care of myself by doing things like getting my exercise and eating mostly well (ice cream notwithstanding…ha!). It’s sad and hard and I am truly worried about what will happen to my ex in the future; but I also accept that it is his life and I am no longer a part of (or party to) that.

1n7nc3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n7nc3l/was_this_a_runners_high/,Was this a runner's high?,"27M UK, 5'9, ~70 kg. Non-smoker. No allergies. Occasional drinker. No other substance use.

Dx. ADHD. No medications at the time.

This first happened back in 2021, and has happened perhaps twice since. One evening I went to my local rock climbing gym and did a short (~1 hr) session. At the time I had been climbing 1-2 times a week for around 6 months. However, after driving home I had an unusual experience that I can't remember ever happening before. I was chilling on the sofa when I began to feel this wave of bliss wash over me. My body felt refreshed, my mind cleared and I felt happy and confident. This sensation came on over the space of a few minutes, peaked for maybe 15, and gradually dissipated over the next hour or so.

What shook me at the time was not just the elevated mood, but also how focussed and clear my mind was for that brief period. It was like all my stress just fell away. I've taken stimulant medication for my ADHD before, and am a regular coffee drinker, but this felt different from a stimulant - I was relaxed, mellow, yet my mind felt sharper than ever. I actually rushed to grab my laptop and do some uni work as I couldn't believe how clear my head felt. It was like I'd unlocked a new brain. I can still vividly remember the moment four years later.

At the time I wondered if I'd eaten something off, but I couldn't think of anything unusual. In the end I just put it down to the elusive 'runners high' that some people experience. I've been running and climbing fairly regularly since, but haven't experienced it again. Interestingly, I've had maybe two similar 'episodes' since; both when I was just chilling at home. However, these were much less intense and were shorter lived. The last time it happened was in 2023. This made me wonder if this could be some type of migraine/seizure aura? I do have occasional migraines, maybe a handful a year, with typical visual aura/fuzzy head symptoms. No other neurological history.

Has anyone else here experienced similar?",0,1756925293.0,AskDocs,1,0.33,False
1n7nase,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1n7nase/first_time_watcher_full_time_idiot/,"First time watcher, full time idiot","Recently I finally decided to check out Twin Peaks after hearing my friend rave on and on about the genius of David Lynch for years, but pretty shortly after starting the first episode I was already extremely confused. To start: the synopsis of the show is about a dead teenage girl from everything I'd read, but by the point I'd got about halfway through the episode there was still no talk of Laura Palmer to be heard? Not only that but I remember several questions that I just couldn't wrap my head around, such as ""holy shit this is *SO* experimental for the 90's, I'm surprised it attracted so many viewers? Like what is with all the super extended silent scenes that barely offer any exposition, or the red curtain backwards talking sequences?"" But I kept going!

Anyway if it wasn't obvious with that (because it certainly wasn't to me) I somehow watched all the way through the first three episodes without realizing that I had accidentally started with season 3... And only after finally catching my mistake did I realize how dumb that was, because I even looked up specific actors that I saw in the show 3 TIMES before somehow realizing the timelines didn't line up. Actually what level of stupid do you have to be to look at an older Matthew Lillard, *fully acknowledging to yourself* that it's an older Matthew Lillard, and still not put together that what you're watching wasn't filmed in the 90s? Along the same line I also knew I recognized the actress that played Tracy, so I looked up her name from the credits just to find out that she played the little girl from The Nanny and thought omg how cool! EXCEPT THE NANNY STARTED AIRING IN 1993 HOW WOULD SHE HAVE AGED 20 YEARS THAT QUICKLY

With my total lack of critical thinking skills aside, if anything I actually do think it's a testament to David Lynch's absolute mastery of directing now because by the beginning episode 4 I still had NO idea what the fuck was going on and yet I was really still digging it! That crazy apparition thing coming out of the glass box to eviscerate poor Grace from The Nanny into a million pieces had me all the way hooked just to figure out what it all meant once everything came together, since I really just figured the show was one of those super avant-garde cult classics that you had to be a huge film aficionado or something (of which I am not) to fully appreciate yknow?

Since all that I quickly went back to view the show in the correct order and I just finished season 1- this show is great. I already know Dale Cooper is going to be one of those characters that sticks with me forever :') he reminds me of Michael from the Good Place sometimes with his infinite enthusiasm for the simple joys in life like coffee and douglas fir trees.",6,1756925213.0,twinpeaks,3,1.0,False
1n7n8u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1n7n8u5/came_across_this_this_article_was_written_by_a/,"Came across this.. this article was written by a teenage Manipuri girl.. tbh quite touching. ""A Letter to my Dead Bestie, in Manipur""","Hey Henny,

The braid is loose again. I tug at the end, but my fingers fumble, they always did when you weren’t there to nudge my elbow and say Slow down, silly. Your hands moved like whispers through my hair, weaving marigolds and something purple you’d plucked from the ditch behind our old school. ""See?"" you’d say, securing the stem with a rubber band smuggled from the maths teacher’s desk. ""Now you don’t look like an idiot."" I’d roll my eyes, but my chest would swell. You made crowns feel possible

I’m in Delhi now and here, Outside my window, traffic bleeds: a relentless, metallic herd. No ditches here. No marigolds choking the edges of football fields. Just concrete, and the smell of exhaust thick as guilt. I promised we’d meet before Ipa’s transfer tore me away. Now, I feel ashamed that I am safe here in Delhi, while many of you are still in Kangleipak. After the rains, we whispered under that tree, pinkies knotted. We’ll find that cave near Sekmai River. You laughed, ""Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks?"" Especially then, I said. Like the shared chowmein at Dingku’s stall, half-spicy for you, no onions for me. Like the way we’d press our thumbs together after tests. Honestly Henny, I never see us as different. What is a Kuki or a Meitei?

I still miss you a lot. The news of you, came, I think around Tuesday. Delhi’s air conditioning hummed like a trapped bee. Clashes intensify, the anchor said. Casualties reported in Churachandpur. I didn’t flinch. Casualties were shapes, not faces. Not your face, tilted back mid-laugh as you tried to balance on the monsoon-slicked wall behind school. Then Ima’s voice, tight as a wire: ""Henny’s gone."" No. The word was a stone in my throat. I swear it was a lie. Weren’t you with your relatives in Mizoram? Please say it is wrong. My cousin had shown me a blurry photo on the screen that he got from whatsapp, a boy’s body curled near a burnt-out jeep. Not yours, I thought. Definitely cannot be yours. Your smile was too bright for shadows.

I remember the last market day before I left. Your mother sold woven baskets near Ima Keithel. You tugged me through the crowd, past stalls smelling of dried fish and ginger. A Meitei vendor spat at your feet. You froze. I saw your knuckles whiten. Then you breathed out, slow as river mud. ""Uncle,"" you said, voice clear, ""My friend here loves your eromba. Extra maroi, yes?"" The man blinked. Nodded. As we walked away, you squeezed my hand. ""Hate is lazy,"" you murmured. ""Like copying homework."" I laughed, but you didn’t. Your eyes were old that day.

Now they tell stories. Meitei mobs burned Kuki homes. Kuki snipers picked off valley boys from the hills. They show videos: women naked, bleeding. Meitei? Kuki? The screen makes them all look like broken dolls. I vomited after the first one. Delhi debates ""ethnic tensions"" on primetime TV. Tribal land rights, they say. Scheduled Tribe status. Words like knives, sharpened far away in rooms smelling of coffee and power. Did you know, Henny? Did you care? Or did you just miss our algebra test that Tuesday?

My birthday cake had fifteen candles yesterday. Ima sang. Ipa clapped. I did not wish to celebrate without you. I closed my eyes, wishing for the cave’s damp darkness. For your elbow jabbing my ribs: Make a real wish! What wish is left? That Meitei mothers didn’t hide petrol bombs in rice sacks? That Kuki fathers didn’t teach sons to load rifles? That Delhi hadn’t directed Manipur to shut off the internet for 80 days so the world wouldn’t see you die.

New Delhi’s silence was indeed the cruelest magic. For weeks, no internet, no help: just more soldiers watching while Meiteis and Kukis slaughtered each other. Modi ji finally spoke when those videos of Kuki women paraded naked went viral. Shamed India, he said. But where was his shame when your people were killed? Or when Meitei boys were butchered in Tengnoupal? When places of worship were vandalised? I especially hate those in the mainland, in quest of their hegemony to make us northeastern's submit to them, they fueled us with lies: Meiteis yelling illegal immigrants! as if our ancestors did not live together under the glorious kingdom of Kangleipak.

Well Henny, if by any miracle you read this, I want to let you know. I found a marigold in Lodhi Garden. Woven into some bride’s photoshoot, probably. I stole it. Sat on a bench, trying to braid it into my hair. The petals tore. Strands tangled. A security guard eyed me. Crazy girl, his stare said. Let him stare. I want to weave our rebellion, Henny. One clumsy braid at a time. Against the lies that we were ever just Meitei or Kuki. Against the silence that thinks 258 bodies are a ""situation,"" not a screaming wound.

The flower falls. I let it go. Somewhere, the Sekmai still flows: carrying ash, carrying blood, carrying the weight of two friends. I’ll find it, Henny. Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks. Especially then.

Henny, you might have left me. You might have broken our childhood promise to grow up together, and to always be by each other’s side. In all honesty, I had a massive crush on you, and well I still do. But perhaps, maybe perhaps, our friendship was the biggest rebellion against the state. I am proud of that. However till then, I still ask:

Why did you leave me? The question claws inside. But the truth writhes uglier: Why did our people choose hatred over children? Why did Delhi look away?

That flower you gave me was more than beauty, Henny. It was a bridge. And I’ll wear its ghost until my hands remember how to build new ones.

Yours Truly,

Lychee as you used to call me

Let me know if this is the wrong sub.,"24 year old male, skinny, used to be very active but now work a desk job and only really walk for activity. No medications, only sort of diagnosis is familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. I get an okay amount of sleep, usually 7-8 hours, but often it dips under 7 hours.

Pretty much every work day like clockwork I eat eggs and toast or peanut butter toast, I drink 1-2 cups of coffee through the morning, and I work a desk job so I’m sitting most of the day. I drink a ton of water. I have a very large appetite so my lunches are usually big with lots of carbs and protein, but usually more carbs than anything.

After lunch I walk for about 30 minutes and once I get back to my desk I crash incredibly hard to the point of falling asleep, and the only thing that solves it is food. Water and caffeine barely help, but the second I eat anything with carbs I feel great again. Is there any way to solve this? I eat a ton and I never gain weight so I assume I have a fast metabolism. Should I just try and eat much less carbs in general? Is it just a sharp blood sugar drop because of the walking? Should I just cut caffeine? More sleep? I’m just lost at what to do to stop crashing so hard. Walking doesn’t seem to help keep my energy up at all.",1,1756925081.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I am planning to visit the area to check things out, but I'd like to have a starting point for where to scout out when I head up there. I've included a little about me and listed what I'm looking for below, so if places you are recommending meet these, or are missing some, please feel free to share what might be included/excluded. Thanks in advance for all the help!

About me
Mid 30's guy. LGBT identifying. Like to participate in various adult recreational sports/leagues and social events. Looking for somewhere that is walkable and social but doesn't necessarily need to be right in the middle of everything. An area where people are friendly or if there is a good meeting spot to socialize would be nice since I won't know many people if I make the move.

Budget
- Ideally I would like to be at $1500 or less. Not necessarily the lower the better, but trying to be reasonable while meeting my higher priority items below.

Amenities
Higher priority amenities I would like on my wish list
- 1 bedroom (large studio could possibly work depending on layout and square footage)
- 575+ sq feet (I work remote so need some room for my desk and normal living)
- W/D in unit (if not in unit then onsite at minimum)
- Parking spot available/included (covered preferably)
- A/C
- Onsite fitness center/gym (not a requirement but would love it)
- A building that doesn't need a lot of repairs (ex: not turning off water every other week for repairs)

Medium priority amenities that would be nice to have
- Bike parking or storage
- Dishwasher
- Secure/gated entry
- Something with a view that's not just facing another building or wall would be nice
- Community/apartment events/socials to meet people/neighbors
- Swimming Pool and/or hot tub

Location
- Walkable neighborhood to park(s), grocery store, coffee shop, and a few social bars to meet people.
- Safe area

Please feel free to share any and all recommendations, links to apartment complex websites or property management websites you recommend, etc. I would plan on visiting in the next two months or so and moving early next year. Thanks again everyone!",0,1756924876.0,askportland,1,0.5,False

From her time conning a United Nations panel into believing she was a wellness expert from Spain, to posing with Alec and their kids on the cover of ¡Hola! magazine, to her time monetizing her miscarriage on Instagram, to her failed podcast(s?), our favorite cultural appropriator has garnered the fascination of many in her clawing quest for fame. 

During her husband’s trial for manslaughter after one of the two people he shot on a movie set was killed following his reported failures to attend firearm safety classes, Hil selflessly donated her time and her children in a one-season run to thousands of viewers to showcase their private lives while surviving the trauma of the manslaughter trial, during which time our empathy queen stuffed allergic-to-cats Alec’s car full of felines, who, along with their zoo of other small animals, were spotlighted by TLC being allowed to defecate all over their expensive home. 

Eel has *always* cared about her physique, maintaining flat washboard abs throughout her pregnancies. 

Hilly, who fashions herself as “Abuelita” to Alec’s daughter’s baby, has parlayed her paparazzi-marketed book about Manuel, where she blamed ADHD for her concocted adult-acquired accent she calls “code switching,” into a new and exciting TikTok page. Did this quell her quest for attention? It would appear as though her desire for fame only grew, and she has found her biggest spotlight yet.   

With Alec’s reluctant side shuffle out of the limelight, Hilly has stiffly jerk-twirled right in, ready for the cameras and a new source of post-Griftmas/post-Rust income. (After all, Comic cons are getting hard on Peepaw.)

1n7n1pr,https://v.redd.it/ncnxhlkuuzmf1,"A Better Way Ministries — From Divorce, Dealing, and Backsliding to Peace, Brotherhood, and Purpose (Jeff’s Testimony)","Before A Better Way (divorce, drift, and dealing):  
I divorced in 2017 and ran from everything I loved. I called it “dealing,” but I was really just keeping myself and everyone around me high to avoid facing what I’d wrecked—my marriage, my kids’ dreams, my family’s trust. In 2019 I went to a faith-based program, met Jesus for real, did well for two years, got the job/house/cars back—then leaned on my own strength, chose the wrong relationship, and slid back fast.

God’s stop sign (jail, closed doors, and a new direction):  
I wrestled with God while I backslid. He kept saying, “Jeff, stop.” I wouldn’t—so He sat me down. I got locked up. My old program changed policies right before court. Every door I tried was a dead end—until Wesley told me about A Better Way. I called, got accepted in days.

First months (resistance to surrender):  
I arrived handcuffed and exhausted—but hopeful. Day one was okay. Days two through ninety? Rough. I wanted a transfer. Probation said “you’re staying,” and something in me finally yielded. I started doing the work instead of trying to control the process.

Brotherhood (men who expose what’s in the cup):  
God used the men here to show me what’s really in me. If you’re carrying coffee and get bumped, coffee spills—because coffee’s in the cup. A Better Way put brothers in my path who “bumped” me in love and exposed my pride, impatience, and self-reliance. The same brothers stayed, prayed, told me the truth, and loved me anyway. Those relationships are gifts I’ll nurture for years.

Florida & baptism (breathing again, no chasing, just presence):  
The Florida trip felt like a clean breath—no chasing, no numbing—just brothers, devotion, and joy. Leadership wasn’t distant; they were with us. The atmosphere was peace, and deeper connections formed. It pushed our group over the top in unity.

What God changed (from self-powered to God-dependent):  
I used to trust Jeff’s talent and hustle. God taught me those “abilities” are gifts—tools to steward, not thrones to sit on. He’s retrained my reflex from self-reliance to dependence: pray first, obey quickly, accept His process (including uncomfortable people and situations), and let Him form Christ in me.

What I’m taking with me (structure, humility, and mission):  
• Daily devotion and accountability—non-negotiable anchors.  
• Humility over control—God uses bumps to sanctify, not to shame.  
• Brotherhood—stay connected; isolation was my trap.  
• Purpose—use my gifts to serve, not to self-promote.

A Better Way Ministries didn’t just get me sober; God used it to turn exposure into freedom, strangers into brothers, and my “coffee” into living water.",2,1756924630.0,TheTestimonyOfJesus,0,1.0,False

I'd gotten one (mocha) from a highly ranked cafe nearby the day before and was disappointed by it, so this wonderfully surpassed my expectations!

There is lots of seating and the ambiance is quite nice/ serene, even if their chairs are not the coziest (only 1 bench with cushions)... I was doing some reading and it's a great place to get some work done (I assume it has wifi but tbh didn't check lol)

Let’s get into the meat of it. I show every text book symptom of OCD and ADHD, due to financial reasons I haven’t gotten a medical diagnosis for OCD, but have gotten one for ADHD and my doctor said that (I have a 120 IQ estimated from the tests I’ve taken) am “too smart to be put on any ADHD meds, and I’m too functional to need them” anywho I look around at everyone around me, any time
I’m in public, I work retail, i consistently pay attention to the people who are around me at all times, always have. In the past I had an addiction to porn, not out lust, I didn’t really use it for pleasure about 60% of the time, just a horribly bad habit, like TikTok is to most. We got together and the conversation of porn came up some time into us dating, I quit, slowly, but did it. Every so often my fiancé says “you have wondering eyes” or “I literally saw you look at that girl” the last fight we had was recent, and resulted in my being more angry than I should have been. But my integrity was attacked, I’ve been cheated on multiple times, I’m not proud of said anger but I pride myself in being faithful, I refuse to put myself around people who pose a threat to my relationship, I don’t text anyone, I don’t add people, I don’t follow anyone, nothing that would be considered inappropriate. I’m starting to go to the gym, and plan to get my life in my own control entirely, and this habit, I still can’t break, I look at people, but I’m not checking them out, I’ve had this fight so many times. The last time was cause I did a “double take”, when walking down an isle we were shopping, apparently there was a
Girl down this same isle, I didn’t look at her, tbh didn’t even notice a girl was in the isle, I was looking at coffee creamers and refrigerated coffee, one caught my eye, I started to walk away, and in my peripheral noticed another one, but since this girl was in the same direction, I was apparently looking at her. Now with this being a fight that does come and go, my explanation does too, at one point in our relationship I was out right checking girls out, not like gawking or staring inappropriately, this was the same time porn was brought up, writhing the same week, and I acknowledge that, and apologized, it hasn’t happened since. Now I just look at people, I’m not checking them out with lust in my eyes or being inappropriate, I’m polite to everyone in public as I’d expect them to be with me, but I’m not flirtatious or anything. I don’t know what to do, I can’t be expected to just stop looking at people, can I? Am I wrong here for looking at everyone, men and women? I’ve reassured so many times and it’s constant jokes or accusations. Last time I apologized, I said I’m sorry if I offended her or if my actions came off a way they weren’t intended, i apologized for my anger, reassured her I look at everyone, I notice people who are around me, I’ve done it since I was a child. Should I try to break this habit? I’ve been sitting around for a few weeks with this in my head now, and I can’t seem to shake it, I can’t let it go.

Her faculties are mainly there, but her eyesight is shot. Of course no one expects to live that long and outlive friends and family. I can tell she is lonely. 

She invites me over at least once a week, but I can't always be there. When I do arrive, she insists on dinner - either she orders food or I pick up food, or sometimes its food her other neighbors give her. However, this is hurting both my wallet and waist, as well as hers, as she claims she's low on funds. I'll say we can just do coffee, but she insists on dinner - yet I'm the one usually eating. I've even said the last few times that ""if you don't want to eat, then why don't we just have coffee"" but she insists on me eating and telling me to eat more while we eat. 

This is one little problem of several - she will eat a few bites and insist that I take the leftovers from her plate. It happens every time, and I'll wrap it to take home and usually I throw it away because I don't want such leftovers. When I've said no, she gets demanding that I take the food. Once she told me ""you're taking two donuts home"" and I said ""no I really can't eat this stuff, thank you however."" To which she responds - ""You're taking two donuts home!"" and I said ""No, just one"" and that followed with another demand; I ignored it. Occasionally she asks me to take home her other leftovers sitting in the fridge - I usually say ""no, I just have no room"" and it turns into a 5 minute back-and-forth. 

She lately now is expecting me to stay for ""long conversation,"" even though I'll say ""I can't stay very long tonight"" - usually I'm there for at least 2 hours; sometimes more. I once left at precisely two hours past, which she felt offended I was leaving ""early"", despite the fact I had said ""I can only stay for a couple hours tonight."" 

She will also say ""maybe you can come by on \_\_\_ day"" which I will say ""I probably cannot do that day"" and she will sometimes still plan on me to come by, having her assistant prep food and telling me the food is prepared. 

I am now starting to dread coming there but she insists on it and occasionally guilt trips, such as ""I never hear from you during the week, if I don't contact you, you won't contact me"" - I work full time and just can't get on the phone to chat. 

I am trying to navigate this without making her feel hurt or more lonely, but I've come close to saying ""I'm sorry, but I see you more than I see my own family, I just can't come over so frequently"" - obviously this should be worded better but I never can seem to say the right things in these situations.

Story:

Throughout the last few months, one of the paralegals has been complementing my bracelet, even asking to wear it. Over time, she has been really helpful to me and has really carried me through my first year practicing. 

Recently, I went on an extended vacation and she helped me out a lot. As such, in order to show appreciation, I decided to get her the same bracelet I have.

  
I didn't think much of it. I gave it to her last week and she instantly returned it and we had a discussion as she thought it was too much but told me that we were fine and she understood it was meant to be friendly and nothing more. I apologized and thought we had moved on. 

  
Today, I got an email from HR warning me about this conduct and asking me to have the paralegal either return or reimburse me. I feel a bit award now and don't know how to proceed. I really did not mean anything by this. I am the type to buy my support staff coffee regularly as a token of appreciation.

1n7mvv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1n7mvv1/investigate_best_portable_ssd_performance_with/,Investigate best portable SSD performance with SanDisk Extreme,"Compact, rugged, and lightning fast, the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD immediately stood out to me when I first got my hands on it. The model name describes exactly what it is: an external solid-state drive designed for adventurous, mobile users like myself. I’ve been testing the 4TB version, and whether I’m storing hours of 4K footage or moving massive photo libraries, this device has quickly become my go-to solution for reliable data storage. That said, there’s a lot to love here, but a few things worth pointing out.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how sleek and practical this drive feels in hand. While compact enough to fit in the palm of my hand, the textured silicon shell not only gave me premium vibes but also reassured me it could survive unexpected accidents. Its two-meter drop protection and IP55-rated water and dust resistance are not just specs; I tested them by accidentally (really) dropping it from my desk onto a hardwood floor. Not a scratch nor a hiccup in performance. Plus, the carabiner loop included was a game-changer, making it easy to latch the drive onto a backpack while on the go. For those of us constantly in motion, durability like this is non-negotiable.  

**Speed and Performance**  
Let me just say, the speed of this thing is borderline magical. We’re talking up to 1050MB/s read and 1000MB/s write speeds thanks to the USB 3.2 Gen 2 technology. Transferring massive raw video files that would normally take ages was laughably quick. I tested it with a range of file types—temporary backups, raw drone footage, massive Photoshop projects—and each transfer felt efficient and seamless. Admittedly, I even found myself casually showing off its performance to a coworker during coffee breaks. The SanDisk branding made it easy to trust that I wasn’t just dreaming the speeds.  

**MASSIVE STORAGE SPACE**  
With a cavernous 4TB of space, this portable SSD felt like pushing the limits of what’s possible for external storage. I dumped multiple folders filled with hundreds of gigabytes of high-resolution photos from a recent road trip, plus full-length videos from my portfolio. My inner content hoarder is thrilled not to have to pick and choose what to keep. And, of course, I’ve barely scratched the surface of the available capacity. Creators and large-scale file users alike can appreciate the peace of mind that comes with this kind of storage freedom.  

**[Check SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0csprksyn/)**

**Security Features**  
One of the standout aspects for me is the integrated password protection with 256-bit AES hardware encryption. Knowing my confidential projects were safe in this SSD brought a sense of relief, especially whenever I passed it around to colleagues during collaborative sessions. Setting up encryption was straightforward. It’s an underrated feature that anyone involved in professional photography or videography will find valuable.  

**Benefits**  
• Incredible read and write speeds for demanding tasks.  
• Impressive durability with water and dust resistance, plus drop protection.  
• Compact and lightweight design ideal for portability.  
• A spacious 4TB of storage is suitable for even the most data-heavy users.  

**Shortcomings**  
• The silicon exterior, while durable, does attract fingerprints and dust too easily.  
• Included USB-C to A adapter feels slightly loose when connected.  
• Premium pricing might not suit budget-conscious buyers.  

**Product Rivals**  
When comparing this SSD to other portable storage solutions, key players like the Samsung T7 Shield and the WD My Passport SSD come to mind. While the Samsung T7 Shield boasts a similarly rugged design, I found the SanDisk drive slightly better in handling outdoor conditions, thanks to its drop resistance and sturdy build. On the other hand, the WD My Passport SSD rivals it in speed but doesn’t reach the same storage capacity at higher levels. Performance-wise, SanDisk edges out competitors in real-world file transfers, though subtle flaws like the easily smudged surface could give others a slight edge in aesthetics.

**Smart Spending**  
Value-wise, the performance and rugged features justify the investment, particularly for creative professionals who need speed and security in one package. Sure, there may be cheaper options, but their limited durability or lower storage capacities may cost you more in the long run when juggling multiple drives. For casual users or those on a tight budget, it may feel like overkill. However, anyone serious about protecting and managing large datasets will likely find this portable SSD worth every penny.

DAVE RAMSEY:  
Welcome to The People’s Ramsey Show! Where we help people redistribute wealth… do the work assigned by the collective… and create actual, amazing relationships while standing shoulder to shoulder with their comrades.  
On the phone we have Jackie from San Francisco, California!  
JACKIE:  
Thank you so much for taking my call, Dave, how are you?  
DAVE:  
Exactly as the party determines, comrade. What can I do for you today?  
JACKIE:  
Yeah, so here’s the deal. I’m the founder of a small tech startup here in the Bay Area. We’re starting to really take off and I’ve got some talented people on my staff. We’re growing but our revenue is still not where it needs to be… we’re barely breaking even. But I want to reward my crew who have been here since the beginning and have been putting in long hours. Could stock options be a fair way to approach this situation?  
DAVE:  
Stock options? That’s bourgeois thinking. You’re handing them a scratch-off ticket and calling it gratitude. You don’t get loyalty by promising “someday money.”  
JACKIE:  
Okay, but… if I just bump up salaries right now, we might not make payroll in three months. Then everybody’s out of a job. Isn’t stock a way to share in the upside later?    
DAVE:  
Let me stop you right there, comrade. You don’t get a pass on math. Two plus two is still four, even in Silicon Valley. If your payroll math doesn’t add up, the problem isn’t the workers’ wages, it’s your business model. Stock options don’t fix a broken budget.  
JACKIE:  
So you’re saying I shouldn’t rely on stock to reward them… even if paying more now might risk the bottom line?  
DAVE:  
Exactly. You reward your comrades with real pay for real work. If you can’t do that, then the system you built is upside down. Fix the foundation before you throw shiny promises on top. If you can’t meet them with real wages, then what you’ve built is a gilded hamster wheel.  
JACKIE:  
But Dave, investors *expect* us to use stock options. That’s how startups attract talent. It’s normal!  
DAVE:  
*Normal* in capitalist America is broke. Debt is dumb, and so is playing Wall Street dress-up with your workers’ futures. Investors want you to run the business for their pockets, not your people’s stomachs. You’ve got to decide: are you building a company, or are you building a collective?  
JACKIE:  
I mean… I still own the company. I built this from nothing. Don’t I deserve some say in how it’s run?  
DAVE:  
You hear yourself? “I built this.” No, comrade. You *started* this. Your workers are *building* it. And here’s a little truth bomb: you’re not going to fix this unless you fix the person in the mirror. Stop thinking like an owner looking down. Start thinking like a brother looking across.  
JACKIE:  
I guess I haven’t thought of my team that way.    
DAVE:  
Building collective wealth is 80% behavior and 20% making sure no one carries more than their fair share.   
JACKIE:  
Okay, so no stock options. Real wages, real transparency. But Dave… what if I give away too much and the business collapses?  
DAVE:  
Then you rebuild it, comrade. Together. When the state owns the factory, and every worker shares equally, you can take your shoes off, walk in the common yard, and the grass just feels different between your toes. That’s not collapse, that’s freedom.  
JACKIE:  
…Wow.  
DAVE:

These networks usually require you to log in through a TurkNet page using a code sent via SMS. I couldn’t find a clear answer online or on Reddit, but since I managed to figure it out—and saw others had the same issue—I thought I’d share the solution that worked for me.

# Step-by-step (tested on iOS, might also work on Android)

I don’t think the operating system matters, but since I did this on an iPhone, I can’t guarantee whether Android behaves the same way.

1. Turn off all SIMs except the one you’ll use to receive the SMS.
   * *Settings → Mobile Service → SIMs → select the SIMs you* ***don’t*** *want to use → Turn Off Line*
2. Make sure roaming is on and that you’re connected to a Turkish telecom provider.
   * *Settings → Mobile Service → SIMs → select the SIM you* ***will use*** *→ Data Roaming \[ON\]*
3. In the Wi-Fi settings for the network, make sure **Auto-Login** is turned on. This will trigger the login page. Enter your name, phone number (include country code, but skip the leading zero), accept the terms and conditions, and connect.
4. You’ll receive the SMS as a notification. **Don’t exit the login screen**—if you do, the login process stops. The SMS will briefly appear as a popup; just enter the code you see, and you’ll be connected.

Hopefully this helps someone else, because the Wi-Fi at these places is actually very good—and not being able to use it really sucks.",2,1756924191.0,istanbul,1,1.0,False
1n7mual,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1n7mual/they_say_new_moms_loose_themselves_in_motherhood/,They say new moms loose themselves in motherhood.,"Not me. Noooooo. Could never be ME?! Yeah, reality check it happened. I made a really big deal about not loosing myself in motherhood while I was pregnant. I told myself it would be harder and it would difficult but I wouldn’t stop doing things for me. And in my own way I’ve adjusted~ reading books on my kindle and taking little target shopping trips or coffee dates w the baby as my “me time.” 

Reality is that there is no “me time.” If you don’t have family nearby or a village. It’s just me and my husband figuring out this new season of life. He works incredibly long hours and helps where he can. And the areas he could help with like nap or bed time, my daughter is so attached to me that he can’t settle her to give me a break. As a SAHM it’s my responsibility to care for our daughter, cook dinner, clean the house etc. Don’t get me wrong I love being a mom and I’m grateful for the privilege to be at home w my baby.  

But prior to being a mom I was an artist. I taught painting classes and did pop up events selling my art. And took a pottery class for fun. I don’t have this expectation that I can paint everyday. But I walk by my easel daily and always say “tomorrow.” And ‘tomorrow’ ends up being the next tomorrow and the next. I don’t have time for myself to sit and paint for a bit. And when I do try to make time for myself without fail the baby ends up crying or wakes from her nap. It’s constantly interrupted. Or by the time I do have “time” I’m so exhausted that I have nothing left to give to anyone let alone the canvas.

Motherhood is hard. I love my baby, being a mom, and simultaneously miss doing things for myself. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. ",60,1756924176.0,NewParents,14,0.95,False

1. A few weeks ago, we got an appointment for October.  This would serve as our safety-net appointment.

2. Today, we scheduled the entire day to go to a DMV office. We chose Carborro, because someone told us it was quick-ish there.

3. We arrived at 6:30 am, the line outside had about 45 people in it. 

4. Just before 7, a nice lady from the ncdmv gave us the details. “You’ll get a ticket and give us your cell phone, We’ll text you when it’s time to come wait in the lobby. Do not miss this!”

5. At 7 they started letting people check in to get their ticket. After some computer issues, we got our ticket around 8.

6. We asked how long they thought it would take. She told us “at least 2-3 hours”

7. The DMV texted us a message including a link to our place in line. “You’ll are checked in and there are approximately 29 walk-in customers ahead of you in line”

8. We drove to a nearby coffee shop for an hour. Then we walked around UNC campus for 45 minutes. I checked our spot in line at 9:45: 15th. We decided to drive back because it seemed to be moving quickly.

9. At 11:30, we had moved up 5 spots to #10. That was slower than expected.

10. At 11:45, we were texted to come wait in the lobby.

11. At 12:36 our number was called

12. We both went to the desk, I provided her paperwork and my ID. I signed a paper and then was told to wait. 

13. She finished the Vision and road sign tests at 12:45

14. She finished the multiple choice test at 12:55 and told me to join her at the desk

15. We paid and the nice man printed a 60 day temporary permit. The real one will arrive in the mail soon.

16. We celebrated with a huge lunch.

1n7mp2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n7mp2q/find_out_if_the_waterdrop_wdg2cf_replacement/,Find Out if the Waterdrop WD-G2CF Replacement Filter Delivers Pure Water Review,"Waterdrop WD-G2CF Filter, Replacement for WD-G2-W, WD-G2-B, WD-G2P600-W Reverse Osmosis System is a product I’ve been personally using for several months. As someone who values clean water, this filter has been a staple in my household to ensure high-quality drinking water for me and my family. While there are a lot of great things to say about it, there are also a few areas worth discussing. Here’s an unfiltered (pun intended) take on what it’s like to use this water filter regularly.

**Design and Build Quality**

The compact and lightweight build of the Waterdrop replacement filter immediately caught my attention. Measuring just 4.9"" in both width and depth, and standing at approximately 8.1"" tall, it’s small enough to fit neatly under the sink without crowding the space. Weighing only 2.64 pounds, it’s super easy to handle, and replacing it doesn’t feel like heavy-duty labor. The filter features a system made using PP cotton and a carbon block, which ensures optimal filtration. I do wish the casing felt more robust, though—it's functional but doesn’t scream “premium” the way some other products in this price range might.

**Filtration Performance**

Let’s talk about what truly matters: water quality. This replacement filter boasts a 2-in-1 filtration stage that effectively reduces sand, rust, particulates, and suspended solids. The clean and pure water it provides has been a game-changer for our household. My morning coffee tastes better, the tap water smells fresher, and gone are the days we needed a separate odor filter. Activated carbon technology also reduces chlorine, albeit not entirely—though, to be fair, most filters can’t promise perfection there. The performance is solid for what it claims to do.

[Check Waterdrop WD-G2CF price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b082d1vz4p/)

**Ease of Replacement**

Convenience is a big deal when it comes to stuff like this. Changing out the filter is a delightfully simple process, taking all of three seconds with just a twist—no tools, no fuss. Even my teenager managed to replace the filter when I was away, which says a lot about its user-friendliness. I’ve had filters in the past that required unscrewing half your plumbing to replace, so this is a huge win.

**Water Output and Lifetime**

What also impressed me is the efficiency. The Waterdrop WD-G2CF filter provides up to 12 months or 1,100 gallons of water before needing replacement. In a family of five, we tend to go through water quickly, but this filter held up remarkably well in our experience. I paid close attention to its performance closer to the 12-month mark, expecting a dip in quality, but the change wasn’t glaring, which indicates great lifespan design.

**Key Benefits**

- Compact and space-saving design prevents clutter under the sink.
- Effective reduction of impurities like sand, rust, and suspended solids.
- Easy replacement process can be done tool-free in seconds.
- 12-month filter life offers long-lasting service with less maintenance.

**Areas of Concern**

While my overall experience has been positive, all products have room for improvement.  

- Doesn't entirely remove chlorine aftertaste; some trace may linger.
- The plastic exterior could be more sturdy for added durability under pressure.
- A higher filtration speed would be appreciated—water flow slows slightly over time.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing it to competitors like the APEC RO replacement filters or AquaPure models, there are some noticeable differences. The APEC filters often have an edge in chlorine removal, which is ideal for users looking for nearly tasteless water, while the AquaPure models boast faster water flow rates. Yet, neither offer the same convenience in replacing filters as the Waterdrop, nor do they fit as seamlessly under compact spaces. For households that prioritize both usability and solid filtration, the Waterdrop strikes a good balance between performance and ease.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Would I say this filter offers bang for the buck? Absolutely. Its competitive pricing, compared to replacement filters for some reverse osmosis systems, makes it a smart buy for anyone looking to maintain a budget without sacrificing quality. Given the reduced maintenance costs and its long lifespan, the investment feels justified for the value it brings to the table. Sure, there are cheaper alternatives, but they either skimp on water purity or present less user-friendly designs.

I was selected for an interview for a shift supervisor position at a brand new location opening at the end of the year. I have worked for Starbucks before briefly. I have been a Shift Supervisor at a few other jobs as well, including a smaller mom n' pop coffee shop, restaurants, and retail. 

  
I quite enjoyed working for Starbucks for the time I did and am excited about the prospect of returning. I like the idea of building a new team and store, if that makes sense. Just wondering what to expect for the first interview? This is a pretty big deal to me, I would like to succeed, and contribute to a successful store. I know the interview will be virtual, and am prepared for that. I feel like I can remember almost 90% of the drink recipes and different floor roles, so I have that on my side too.

  
If it's worth anything, I was a Shift Supervisor at a franchised Starbucks location, but not during my time at a corporately run store, so I understand there are going to be differences.

I am probably stressing myself out for no reason, but I really think this would be a good opportunity and would like to make it happen. Any input is appreciated.

1n7mhfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marik0Galsun/comments/1n7mhfh/samantha_and_blake_a_love_story/,"Samantha and Blake, a love story","The cold toilet seat was a stark contrast to the heat building in the pink silicone encasing him. Blake settled onto it with a soft sigh, the familiar ritual of sitting to pee both mundane and humiliating. He had to old back, letting his release go in light pulses so he would not spray all over the place. It would be easier to just go in the shower, but Samatha forbade that, and said it was disgusting. He finished his unsatisfying urination, the sound of the his pulses dribbling into the toilet water being the only noise in the tiled room. No sigh of relief to be heard from him. As he reached for the handle, sight of latex in the small wicker wastebasket caught his eye.

It was a condom. Used. Full of cum. Knotted at the top.

His body reacted before his mind could fully process it. A jolt, sharp and electric, shot through his groin. His penis, confined and stifled in its cage, began to swell in its pink translucent prison, pressing insistently against the unyielding silicone. A dull, throbbing ache began to build, a pressure that was both pain and a desperate, frustrated need. He stared at the thing in the trash, his mind conjuring the image of it being rolled onto a penis large than his, then fulfilling its use inside Samantha, filled up. His own trapped cock twitched with ceaseless pulsing in useless protest against the cage.

He sat, and stared at it. She had put on on him one, a magnum, just before they were about to have sex for the first time. She rolled it down his slender shaft, all the way to the base, and laughed. 

""This is WAY too big for you,"" she said. Then pulled it off with an easy tug. He still had pubic hair then, and the condom took a few pubic hairs with it as it easily slide off  that failed to even slightly stretch it. He winced in pain, but there was more pain to come.

""I'm sorry,"" she told him. ""I don't have condoms for one this small. I know they are out there,"" she told him, and got out of bed. She returned with a measuring tape and her lap top. After small measured, she googled up ""small condoms,"" and arrived at MyOne, sizing him to 45c. Their smallest. ""You are going to have to order these,"" she told him. ""I am really sorry. I know you thought you were going to have sex.""

Blake sighed staring at the condom then stood up and stepped into the shower to rinse the cage, and decide to take a cold shower to give himself some release. The water was cold. He’d turned the knob all the way to cold, raising goosebumps on his skin. He stood under the spray, his teeth clenched, willing the chill to seep through the silicone and quell the rebellion in his loins. He soaped the cage meticulously, his fingers slick and clumsy as they slid over the smooth surface, a mockery of the touch he craved. Each pass was a reminder of what was locked away, what was denied. The cold did its work, eventually. The urgent pressure subsided.

After wrapping in his forest-green silk kimono Samantha got him for his birthday, the cool fabric a gentle whisper against his damp skin, he opened the bathroom door. Samantha emerged from the bedroom at the same moment.

She was freshly showered too. Her damp hair was up in a ponytail. She wore an oversize t-shirt that was miles too big for her petite frame, the hem brushing her mid-thigh. The cotton clung to the faint, promising dampness between her breasts. The shirt’s design was for some band he didn’t recognize and one of many she owned that had once belonged to a ""boyfriend,"" that was really fuck buddy.

“You are gonna want to change the sheets, babe,” she said. Her voice was light, casual, as if she’d just asked him to take out the recycling.

His gaze drifted past her to the rumpled comforter on their bed. ""Yeah. I know."" He tried to keep his own tone even, neutral. “Who was it?” He had no idea if it was a regular, or someone new.

“Mike,” she replied, without hesitation in her voice. “We made a video for you.”

He deflated. A video. The condom in the trash. Mike, her gym buddy. The image of Mike, tall, muscular, black, and hung, flashed in his mind. Blake just nodded, the silk of his robe suddenly feeling restrictive.

He moved to the kitchen on autopilot, the clean, clinical motions of cooking a temporary distraction. He seared the salmon, tossed the greens, whisked the vinaigrette. They ate at their small table, talking about each others day without mention of the tryst with Mike or what was to come. She went to class and worked out - leg day. He went to class and went to hot yoga, then class again. Samantha scrolled through her phone, then picked up a book. He cleaned the kitchen of the mess from dinner, then changed the bed sheets.

After that, on the couch, they watched Only Murders in the Building. They snuggled, her body a warm, pliant weight against his side. His arm was around her, his fingers stroking the soft cotton t-shirt covering her shoulder. It was a normal, domestic moment on the precipice of a descent into erotic madness.

When the credits rolled, she shifted. “I think it is time,” she murmured, her voice a low thrum that vibrated against his chest.

She reached for her Macbook Air on the coffee table. A few clicks, and the Apple TV screen transitioned from Hulu to AirPlay and the video menu on Samantha's Macbook.

The video was high definition from the tripoded GoPro on their dresser. It started with a close-up. Samantha’s lips, glistening and parted, wrapped around the head of an enormous, dark penis. The silver key on a gold chain around her neck sparkling.

“You are so much bigger than Blake. I can never get over it,"" she said. Not to Mike, though he as where getting his cock sucked. She said it to Blake, eye fucking the camera as she took a pause from sucking, stroking the monster with both hands.

And it was true. Mike's African spear was over 7 inches long, and as thick as her wrist. Blake's cock was a disappointing 3.5 inches, and barely wider than her thumb, locked in pink silicone.

Her voice was breathy, filled with a wondrous awe that took his breath away just as Mike's massive meat took Samantha's breath away.. On screen, her tongue swirled, her hands stroked the impressive length she couldn’t fully take into her mouth, at least in the position she was in. thick and veined, a monument of male potency.

Blake watched, frozen, as she worked the thick and veiny black organ with a devoted focus he rarely saw from her. She brought him to a full, glistening hardness that looked almost unreal. Then she rose from him, went to her nightstand and zoomed out the camera with the GoPro remote. Then took out a condom. Not one of Blakes MyOne 45cs. A Magnum. She rolled it onto him like she was wrapping Christmas present.

She mounted him. Faciung the camera, reverse cowgirl The angle was perfect, capturing the expression on her face the moment she guided him inside her body. The slow, breathtaking stretch as she impaled herself. Her head fell back, her mouth forming a silent cry of pleasure. She rode him, her body a graceful, rising and falling. Then, with a smile at the camera, she rose and and turned, to take the black pole cowgirl depriving Blake of her expressions as she ground down. Her body quivered and shuddered, her moans and announcement loud. She chased her climax again and again until he finally found his.

""Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. I'm gonna cum. Fuck yeah.""

The screen went black.

Silence thundered in the room. Blake couldn’t move. The ache in his cage was no longer a dull hum but a sharp, insistent agony. It felt hot and swollen, a trapped animal desperate for release. A slick, warm dampness leaked from the tip, a mortifying testament to his beta boyhood, watching Samantha fuck a real man.

Samantha set the laptop aside and turned to him. Her eyes were dark, her expression unreadable. She reached out, her fingertips cool as they brushed against the silk covering his thigh and reached in to touch the slickness of his cage, confirming his shame.

""Let's got to bed,"" she whispered.

Her fingertips traced the damp spot on his green silk robe, a humiliating reminder of the video’s finale. The cold shower had been a feeble defense against the heat of his own pathetic arousal, and now this. Samantha’s touch on his cage had been clinical, a scientist confirming a predicted result.

She led him to the bedroom, a space that still smelled of afternoon sex, and the musk of Mike’s sweat. She peeled off her oversized t-shirt, the cotton swallowing her petite frame, and tossed it into the laundry basket without a glance. She slid under the cool sheets completely naked, her body enticing Blake to further arousal.

Blake hung his kimono on a peg behind the door. The air felt heavy, his breathing labored, the pink silicone cage giving an ache to his loins. He joined her snuggling. For a long moment, they just lay there, side-by-side, the video of her performance with Mike connecting them in silence.

She turned her head on the pillow. Her eyes, studied his face, but her intentions remained a mystery to Blake.

Her hand came up, her fingers gently tracing the line of his jaw. The touch was so soft it was almost unbearable. He flinched, then stilled, his every nerve ending screaming for more.

""Blake,"" she whispered, her voice a low murmur that vibrated through the stillness.

That was all it took. The dam broke. He turned into her, her mouth finding his in the dark.

It wasn't a gentle kiss. It was a collision. A desperate, hungry claim. Her lips pressed to his with a frantic energy, as if her mouth had not been on another man just hours before. Blake's torment fueled her lust. She fed on his desperation, tasting it, savoring it.

Her tongue met his in fierce exploration, teasing his desires. Fanning his flames. He could taste the mint of her toothpaste, but it did nothing to erase the image of black cock in her mouth. He lost himself in the sensation, his hands gripping her shoulders, pulling her flush against him. The confinement of his cage pressed into her thigh, a frustrating, undeniable barrier.

Se broke the kiss, leaving him gasping for air, her forehead resting against his. His lips traveled down, across the smooth skin of her cheek, along the elegant column of her neck, until his mouth found the tight, peak of her breast.

He took her nipple into his mouth, suckling gently at first, then with increasing pressure, his tongue circling the aroused flesh. A soft, approving sigh escaped her lips. Her back arched, pressing herself more firmly into his mouth. One of her hands came up to cradle the back of his head, holding him there. The other hand wandered down his side, over his hip, and found his captive, straining flesh.

She didn't grab it. Her fingertips merely brushed against the silicone, tracing the outline of his imprisoned, stifled erection. The effect was electric. A sharp, needy hummed from his throat, muffled against her breast.

Her other hand left his head and found his right nipple. She didn't caress it. She pinched. Sharp and precise. A jolt of painful pleasure shot through him, making his whole body tense. She held the pressure, rolling the sensitive nub between her thumb and forefinger.

""Please, Sam,"" he begged, his voice ragged and tight. ""Please, let me cum. I need it. I'm so close.""

She released his nipple, her hand sliding down to rest on his cage again, feeling the pathetic tremor within. ""I know you are,"" she said, her tone flat, almost bored. ""You're always close. That's the whole problem, isn't it?""

""Please,"" he whined, pushing his hips against her stationary hand in a pathetic struggle hump that if she let him continue would yield a ruined orgasm in his cage. A not infrequent result.

""Beg harder,"" she commanded, her voice gaining an edge. ""Use your words. Tell me why you deserve it.""

He swallowed, shame and desire warring within him. ""I-I made you dinner. I cleaned up. I watched your video. I've been so good.""

She laughed, a soft, cruel sound. ""That's your job. That's baseline. Try again. Tell me what you really are.""

He squeezed his eyes shut. ""I'm… I'm your boyfriend. I love you.""

Her fingers tapped impatiently on the cage. ""Wrong answer.""

A tear of frustration welled in the corner of his eye. ""I'm… I'm your little beta. With my… my little penis. I am your little bitch. I am pathetic, and lucky to get any attention from you at all."" The words were bitter in his mouth, but they also sent a fresh wave of dizzying submission through him. His perverse submission making him ache even more

""How little?"" she pressed, her voice dropping to a whisper.

""T-Three and a half inches,"" he choked out.

""Compared to Mike?"" The name was a dagger.

""Tiny,"" he gasped. ""Nothing. He's a real man.""

""Good boy. You are my little bitch,"" she cooed. She gave his cage a final, patronizing pat and slid out of bed.

Blake’s eyes flew open. She rolled over to her night stand, her naked form a perfect curves against the faint light.

His heart hammered against his ribs. The possibilities unspooled in his lust fogged mind, each a different flavor of torment and ecstasy. He saw her taking the small silver key from her neck, unlocking him, her fingers rolling the pathetically small MyOne 45c condom onto his eager, dripping cock. She’d push him onto his back and lower herself onto him in the amazon position, her powerful thighs straddling his hips, tell him how she could his insignificant length finger banging her man fucked pussy, and then mock him as he pre jac into the condom in barely a minute.

Or maybe she would ignore the key entirely. His eyes fixed on the drawer as she opened it. He imagined her pulling out the large, veined black cock sheath, that monstrous black silicone form. Then perhaps take out the numbing cream, spreading the cool, viscous gel over his trapped, sensitive head before encasing him in the hollow, intimidating prosthesis. Tucking the restraining strap under his scrotum. Then she’d ride the fake cock, moaning for its massive, unreal girth, while he felt nothing but a distant, muffled pressure, a ghost of the pleasure would feel as if he were a real man with a cock that could give her pleasure.

Another image, sharper, more intimate: the purple Feeldoe. She’d fill her tightness with the pony end of the double-ended, lesbian sex toy. She’d lube the lipstick lez end. Then raise his legs, gentle at first, her hands soothing as she prepared him. She’d enter him, unlock his little penis, coaxing a ‘boigasm’ from her lubed hand pussy. As his little cock spurted, she'd start, hitting his prostate with unerring accuracy, overwhelming his nervous system until he convulsed with a helpless, mind-melting ‘girlgasm,’ his cock, dribbling with each thrust, spurting again.

The darkest fantasy gripped him: she would simply select the black Feeldoe, leave his cage firmly locked, and take his boi pussy with the rigid toy. Calling him her little slut as she thrust into him, the painal blurring all else until he screamed, his orgasm ripped from him while he remained utterly confined, her complete and total property.

He watched, breath held, as her hand disappeared into the drawer. The soft clink of objects moving. Which one? Which one? The suspense was a physical ache, sharper than the pressure in his cage.

Samantha paused, her head tilting as she looked back at him sprawled on the bed, his desire and dread painted clearly on his face. Her expression pondering the choices in her drawer.",1,1756923379.0,Marik0Galsun,0,1.0,False

I’m a bit all over the place, which I’m sure you’ve already noticed, so I won’t mind if you are, too. I love reading odd books, walking my ornery dog, and losing myself in projects around the house.

I’m not after love or shallow desire.

1n7mgot,https://www.reddit.com/r/mecfs/comments/1n7mgot/morning_exhaustion_electrolytes_protein_and_water/,"Morning Exhaustion; Electrolytes, Protein and Water Intake","Not sure if this would be helpful for anyone, but I thought I'd share my experience.

I'm 27F, I've struggled with mornings since my chronic fatigue symptoms started, over 15 years, essentially since I hit puberty. Since my ME/CFS diagnosis a little over a year ago, multiple practitioners (GP, IM, naturopath, HTMA) have suggested similar things to help make it out of bed in the morning.

**Protein** for breakfast was something my naturopath really encouraged, and I knew I genuinely felt better when I did include it, so I tried my best to have eggs every morning, but eating immediately in the morning has always made my nauseous and want to vomit, not to mention frying an egg being too hard for me most days. I can however, drink as early as I like, so protein shakes were a major game changer to get my digestive system warmed up, avoid taking medication on an empty stomach, and get some protein energy in my body.  
Protein powder is definitely cheaper, but on my hardest days, mixing it with water well enough that it wasn't chunky was impossible, so for harder days I keep the premade shakes on hand. A Costco membership makes this much more affordable, and buying in bulk makes sense when I have at least one every day. I find they're on sale super often so that makes it even better.  
If anyone's curious, I use the Lean Fit whey protein powder (tastes surprisingly good in just water, but milk is great if you like it creamy) and Premier Protien shakes. They also have the Alani shakes, but they were WAYYYY too sweet for me and in order for them to be palatable I had to water them down 50/50 with milk and that's just so much liquid to drink and adding to the cost. They occasionally carry the Fairlife shakes, which are amazing and lactose free but they sell out FAST. I'd recommend joining your local Costco FB group so others can let you know when they're in stock. Across the board, the prices are an insane discount and the amount you save on protein could be enough to pay for your yearly membership alone.

**Electrolytes** were also a persistent recommendation. It was suggested in some of my tests that my salt intake was too low. This was unsurprising to me because I only enjoy salt in moderation and hate anything that's too salty. I don't like chips and I have an insane sweet tooth. But electrolytes = energy so I had to do something.  
I know people with POTS often have liquid IV or a salty snack first thing in the morning. I tried buying a few chips that I can tolerate but like I said, solid food first thing in the morning has always been really difficult for me.  
The obvious answer was electrolyte drinks. I've always been disgusted by Gatorade and Powerade, and caffeine sends me straight past coffee jitters and into a full blown panic attack so energy drinks have always been out of the question and I've never had one. I tried Liquid IV, Hyrdalyte, and Organika; all great options if you can find a flavour you like, but personally I couldn't stomach a single one and ended up giving them all away to friends. I try very hard not to be picky, and im aware it's often a mental game but no matter what I did my body choked it up. I tried diluting it, adding lemon juice, making it really cold, I even tried concentrated shots. It was just simultaneously too salty and too sweet and artificial. Finally last week I saw a TikTok of someone with a similar experience and they were taking electrolyte pills. Just tablets or capsules of salt and potassium. Genius. You can find them on amazon advertised for runners or POTS. I already take like 20 supplements a day so I wanted something I couldn't taste and wasn't chewable, so I got the [Vitassium brand](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B076MXR1LV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) electrolyte capsules. I'm sure literally anything you find would do the trick but I wanted minimal ingredients and capsule form. It's much easier for me to take two and drink 500ml of water with the rest of my pills in the morning.  
That being said, if you can stomach drink powders, Costco once again has great options and prices. If this is something you're going to be using daily, buying in bulk is the cheapest option.

**Water intake** has always been a struggle for me. I found out over the last few years and the combination of my anemia and other things results in me rarely feeling thirsty. I've always forgotten and had to make a conscious effort to make sure I'm drinking enough, or really anything at all. Drinking more than a few sips often makes me nauseous. Some things that have helped me are obviously #1 making sure I have a good water bottle filled and close by at all times. For me it helps if it's cute and a decent size but not too big to lug around. I'd personally rather refill it than carry a gallon around the house with me. Another thing that helps is drinking through a straw. I have an Owala with a free sip lid, so it's got one built in. A long time ago I heard that you typically will end up drinking more water if you drink through a straw, and it's easier to do it mindlessly while watching tv or scrolling on my phone. I find not using a straw takes more conscious effort. And lastly making sure I always have ice and cold water on hand. I know many people say room temperature water is what's best for you, but I've always preferred cold water, and now I've found I drink even more if it's ice cold. I got some cute [ice cube trays](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0C2Q7SZRQ?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) on amazon and we keep a huge brita filter in the fridge.   
One MAJOR thing that actually helped me with my water intake was weekly **saline injections**. When I got an iron infusion for my anemia, I felt basically cured for about three weeks, and then returned to feeling my all-time worst. I asked my GP about this, my iron labs came back high, and when I suggested it could be the saline he scoffed. But I continued to look deeper into it and found some ME/CFS people on TikTok who said they found some benefit, so I made an appointment at a local med-spa. I ended up continuing weekly litres of saline for almost six months. It didn't cure me, but it did give me a boost of energy and actually helped my feelings of thirst return and feel less nauseous when drinking more than a couple sips. Saline injections are usually half the price of normal vitamin injections, mine started out at $42CAD but for various reasons went up to $52-68, which was really pushing it IMO. Considering I'm currently unable to work and relying on my husband's income, so I don't do it at the moment, but I'm considering going back at some point. 

Thanks for reading my lengthy post, lemme know if you have any suggestions or questions, I'm totally open to hearing what you think and I hope something in here helps!",1,1756923336.0,mecfs,0,1.0,False
