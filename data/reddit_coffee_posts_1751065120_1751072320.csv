1lma55w,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetryFree/comments/1lma55w/waves_of_loss/,Waves of Loss,"This is a haibun — a blend of prose and haiku — that explores the emotional and practical impact of sudden job loss, displacement, and quiet perseverance. It’s based on a very personal experience my wife and I went through. I’d appreciate any thoughts, interpretations, or feedback. Thank you for reading.

# Waves of Loss

I had no warning. Management said only: *“You are no longer needed.”* No explanation. No farewell. Just an order to return what was never truly mine — my nametag, my access, my identity.

>

I clocked out for the last time. The doors closed behind me. I stood outside a place I thought I’d grow old in. I didn’t know how to walk home without carrying shame.

>

At home, there was silence. Not peaceful — empty. How do you tell your partner the job is gone? That the house they gave us with the job will vanish too? That security is something you only thought you had.

>

We moved into a motel. Nights hummed with the drone of a mini fridge, the soft creak of unfamiliar beds. Our savings dissolved like sugar in hot water. Each job application returned nothing.

>

Time stretches. My hope thins. I keep my grief quiet. There's no one left to ask for help. I bear the weight alone — not because I want to, but because I must.

>

Still, each morning I rise. Not for the promise of a job, but for the person I love. I haven’t given up. But I now understand that loss doesn’t come all at once — it comes in waves.

>

Each day, the motel feels more like a waiting room. The hours stretch between job searches and the sound of the heater kicking on. My wife speaks less, but her movements say enough — folding clothes slowly, placing the instant coffee just so. There’s comfort in her quiet rituals. A kind of survival.

>

We don’t talk much about the future. Not because we don’t care — but because we’re afraid to guess wrong. We’ve stopped asking each other, *“Any news?”* We already know the answer.

>

At night, I lie awake and wonder what I’ve become. I used to be a provider. A steady force. Now I’m just a shadow in the dim motel mirror, calculating days, avoiding calls I can’t return.

>

Still, I rise. Still, I search. Not out of hope, always — but out of duty. Out of love. Out of the bone-deep belief that even now, there must be something left to build.

I’m a 25-year-old guy looking to expand my social circle. I’ve been thinking lately that it’s time to meet new people, make new connections, and just get out of my usual routine. I’m open to meeting people from all walks of life, whether it’s to grab coffee, talk about life, or just chill and enjoy new experiences.

I’m into sports, fitness, music, travel, and I love to spend my time outdoors when I get the chance.

When I’m not out and about, you can probably catch me reading, following up on politics, or completing my errands.

I’m all about good conversations! Whether it’s diving into deep topics or just having a laugh over something random.

Looking forward to connecting with some new people!",1,1751072086.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False

This one was also a fun one but i do wish I had written certain parts a little better, still the idea behind it was fun. But anyway I hope you enjoy and stay creeped!))  
  
My name is Alex and as I write this, I know it’s only a matter of time before the RCMP find me. And when they do, they're either going to question me about why I burned my house down or take me, probably both honestly.

Right now I’m held up in the nearest hotel, not planning on going anywhere. I have barely slept and I don’t think I'm going to get much more sleep going forward.

They’re going to want answers and the truth is, I don’t have any good ones, none that makes any sense anyway. Hell, I don’t understand what happened myself. Their gonna think I’m insane or something but they can go look for themselves once the fire dies down and they can look down in that fucking hole in the basement.

Besides, how do I explain to them that I found another house beneath my basement?

It all started a couple of weeks ago when I found a property for sale while driving around. In this market, you don’t expect to find anything remotely affordable anymore, let alone a full house for $50,000. That alone should’ve raised red flags, but it didn’t. I was too caught up in the price so much that nothing else mattered to me.

There was no online listing, no real estate agent, nothing. Just an old wooden sign staked in the front yard: *FOR SALE* scrawled in fading red paint, with a phone number beneath it. I called. The man who answered sounded old and told me it was for sale for $50,000. I bought it on the spot and spoke with him a little longer to arrange a day to purchase it.

I should’ve known something was off from the start. But I didn’t, or maybe I did and chose to ignore it. I don’t know anymore.

It was tucked away near the end of an old, half-forgotten road where barely anyone lived anymore. The distance between each house made fences kind of pointless unless you REALLY needed privacy, just empty land with thin, scattered trees that looked more dead than alive. There were more shadows than people out there somehow.

The house itself was small. Tiny really, especially by modern standards. A little paperwork, a quick money transfer and suddenly, I was a homeowner. Well “new” owner at least. The place was old and worn, but I didn’t care. It was my house now. 

The man selling it was in his seventies, maybe older. Pale, wrinkled, like someone who hadn’t slept properly in months. He said he was heading to the East Coast to live with his family somewhere in Labrador. He told me his wife had passed away just a few months earlier. Found her one morning in the back garden. Dead, just lying there in the grass. He didn’t say how she died and I didn’t press him for details.

It wasn’t exactly the comforting image you want burned into your mind when buying a house, but still I had the deed and for the first time in my life, I owned something that wasn’t some shitty apartment I was renting for more than what it was really worth.

That night I drove over to pick up the keys from him. It was already late well past sunset and the road leading to the house was barely lit. Only a single streetlamp buzzed weakly near the edge of the property, casting just enough light to see the outline of the porch. The rest of the house was drowned in darkness. No lights on inside. Not even a glow from a window, just blackness inside.

The front door was slightly ajar hanging open like someone had left in a hurry. On the porch, right in front of the doorway the keys were sitting on the ground. No note or anything.

I bent down to pick them up and the moment my fingers touched metal something came rushing out towards me from the house, nearly knocking me to my ass from jumping back so quickly.

It was the old man.

He rushed out the front door fast, faster than I thought a man his age could move and walked straight past me without a word. Not even a glance in my direction. He had this wide, unsettling smile stretched across his face like he just did something wrong and got away with it. It was unnerving the way he smiled.

He didn’t stop either. He didn’t turn back to look at me or anything, just kept walking until he reached the other side of the road and kept walking further and further until he was out of sight in the darkness.

I stood there on the porch, keys in hand, trying to process what I had just watched until I couldn’t see the old man at all. I had no clue what was in that direction at all, an uneasy feeling overtaking me even when I glanced back to the house again with its front door wide open now, the pitch blackness inside haunting in its own way.

What got me the most was how tall the old man looked that night. He seemed taller than I remembered him being when we first met, almost unnaturally so. Maybe it was the night playing tricks on me or maybe it was just the sheer unease of that moment, the sight of him rushing past grinning ear to ear in the dark, that had scared me more than anything at the moment when I saw him rushing past me. I never saw him again.

It took a few days before I was fully moved into the house. There were the usual chores of changing the locks, bringing in the essentials, trying to make the place feel like mine by placing furniture and photo’s everywhere. It may have looked small from the outside, but the house had a deceptive amount of space. Two modest bedrooms, a cramped kitchen, a tight but functional living room, and even a pull-down ladder that led to a shallow attic you had to crouch in to move around. But what really surprised me was the basement. The stairs creaked with each step you took but they led down into a massive, open space about the size of the entire footprint of the house above it. It was dark, musty, and smelled faintly of damp stone and old wood, but it had potential.

Like the rest of the place, it needed work. The exterior was in rough shape, yellow paint flaking off in long strips, roofing shingles cracked and curling in spots, the kind of damage that only years of sun, wind and neglect would do to them over time. Still, with how little I spent on the place I had enough saved to start making improvements. I wanted to build something for myself finally.

It was only two days ago that everything changed.

It had been raining hard all day, the kind of steady yet heavy, cold rain that soaks through everything it touched. I was heading down into the basement to grab a toolbox when I noticed nearly two feet of water at the bottom of the staircase.

I looked around for the source, expecting to find a burst pipe or a window left open, but there was nothing I could see that was letting the rain water in.

I scrambled to collect the buckets, pans, even plastic bins, anything I could use to start scooping water into to help fight the rising water. I’d scoop up what I could, run it outside, and toss it far from the house, only for the water level to rise again when I came back. It was a losing battle yet I had to keep trying, the last thing i needed was my entire basement filled with water and reach the top of the staircase..

On my sixth trip down there, something gave.

As I was rushing to the bottom of the stairs I heard a sound, a deep, hollow like sound, like wood giving way under pressure. Then, all at once, the water began swirling, spiraling toward the center of the basement like in a sink once the plug was pulled. It drained quickly, all of the water rushing downwards until all of it was gone, leaving behind a single hole dead center in the basement.

It was no bigger than my fist  right in the middle of the floor. I waited for the last of the water to vanish before approaching it with caution. My first thought was it was an old floor drain. Maybe it had been blocked for years and finally gave way once there was enough water down here, but when I shined my phone’s flashlight into it that idea died pretty quickly.

There was no pipe, no grating, no rusty metal or broken pipe, just a black void in the center of my basement floor. The dirt and cement around the edges were rough yet round at the same time, maybe a collapse but it was level with the floor somehow.

The closer I got to it to look, the weirder it started to get.

With my phone’s flashlight, I could just barely make out what looked like... another floor beneath me, far far below. Was it a second basement? Another room? I had no clue what the hell I was looking at at that moment.

I wanted to know more. I *needed* to. But making the hole bigger was a risky move. If the foundation was as old and brittle as the rest of the house, I could bring the whole damn floor out from under me, hell I could even make the house collapse over me. Okay maybe not that last bit but you get my point.

At the same time there was absolutely nothing I could do at the time being. The rain water was gone thankfully but until tomorrow no one was going to be swinging by and checking it out for me, not until tomorrow at least.

Worst case scenario, I figured I could grab a piece of plywood, cover the hole, and pour concrete over it, that would seal the damn thing off and pretend it was never there. Not a perfect fix but at least it would keep the basement from collapsing under me…hopefully.

When the morning came I stepped outside to inspect the house for any more damage from the storm before finally making my way back down to the basement. I was expecting the hole to still be there. What I wasn't expecting was the hole to be much bigger now overnight.

What was once the size of my fist was now easily large enough for a grown man to jump through. No digging or tools required for the job, just a clean, dark opening in the middle of my basement floor. Looking down into it again I could finally confirm what I thought I’d seen the day before, a wooden floor much deeper down then I thought originally. There even seemed to be boxes down there as well

Even if I wanted to go down there the drop was too far. There was no way I’d be able to climb back up if I just jumped down there. Hell I would probably bust my leg up just jumping down there, the only way to safely reach the bottom was with a ladder. So I got one.

I drove to the nearest hardware store and bought the longest extension ladder they had, along with a decent flashlight, something stronger than what my phone's flashlight could handle. When I got back I carefully lowered the ladder into the hole, extending it as far as it would go until it finally touched the bottom. The very top of the ladder barely grazed the stone floor below. If the floor it leaned on gave out while I was climbing down I would for sure fall and probably break something along the way.

I took my time descending step by step, testing each one with my full weight before committing to the next. The moment my feet touched the bottom, I realized how strange the air felt. Warm and dry, too dry for a space underground that had just flooded.

I flicked my flashlight to look around the room, the shape of it was off somehow.

The wooden walls rose upward at a sharp angle, forming a triangular space that immediately struck me as familiar. I turned slowly as pieces started clicking in my head. “This looks just like my attic” I remember telling myself, only it was taller and almost thinner on the sides in a weird warped kind of way.

Even the boxes down here looked similar to the ones I had in the attic only stretched into more odd shapes. Inside the boxes though was nothing but crumpled up paper and old splintered wood that smelt like they were decaying for a while. It wasn’t long before i spotted the pull down staircase like in my actual house.

I hesitated at first before yanking it free and carefully descended once more, my flashlight flicking around in my hand as I stepped lower and lower into this house under my basement.

The darkness swallowed  me as I entered the hallway.

I was standing in what looked like my own living room, almost exact to my living room. Same furniture, same shitty worn down rug, the same family photos hanging on the walls. The photos were wrong though, stretched in a way that it was like someone editing them used a tool to stretch them taller and thinner without adjusting them to look right..

The pictures with myself in them scared me the most.

All of the photo’s with myself standing in them made me look off in so many ways, it was the only part of any of the pictures that looked proper within them, yet I look monstrous in them. I looked taller but thinner, my eyes wide and a huge grin smeared across my face in an almost impossible way. It scared me a little to look at them.

I moved toward the kitchen, stepping lightly as I did. The air felt still and heavy, it was like no one had been down here in ages yet everywhere I look things I had in my own house were place perfectly where I left them, the kitchen was a perfect sight of this with a plate and fork left in the sink, and a coffee pot left on the counter from this morning. The kitchen was just as distorted, tall counters and oversized cabinets. Two impossibly thin chairs that looked exactly like what I had but scaled like props in some surreal movie scene. I would have had to jump to sit on them and even then I’d probably snap them like twigs from doing it.

There were windows but instead of letting in light they were filled with dirt and stone, the dirt pressed right up to the glass. No sunlight could reach this far underground, but the lights overhead… they looked intact despite their oddly stretched design.

I stepped to one of the light switches and flicked them up.

For a split second  the bulbs flashed with an intense light, revealing just how wrong everything was. The sudden light flash made the bulbs pop loudly and killed them in an instant. Within that brief moment of light I thought I saw something at the end of the hallway leading into the living room.

The light was on and gone so quickly I couldn’t tell what it was, but it was tall, unbelievably tall as it stood there staring at me.

I quickly raised my flashlight down the hallway, the beam bouncing wildly off the walls. I could’ve sworn I saw something, someone even standing there. I froze, heart pounding, eyes locked on the place where it had been as my hands shook holding the flashlight. My mind raced to make sense of it, where the hell it even came from, but it came up empty. Panic started to creep in as I backed into the kitchen counter with my hand blindly searching for anything to use, it landed on the handle of a kitchen knife. It was long and thin, barely more than a glorified machete then a knife, but it was the only thing between me and whatever might be waiting on the other side of the hallway.

I stepped forward slowly, each foot step echoing too loudly on the warped wood. The silence was thick like the house itself was holding its breath as I moved through it. I inched my way to the end of the hallway, ready to fight whatever the hell was over there only to find nothing, nothing at all.

Did my eyes play tricks on me with the sudden flash of light?

I stood there for what felt like forever trying to calm myself, trying to make sense of what I’d seen while searching every inch of the living room for anything at all. There was nothing, nothing except for one more room in this messed up house.

The basement.

Every piece of me screamed at me to not go down. God only knows what the hell was waiting for me down there, yet I needed to see now, I had to see what was down there.

I took my time, descending the narrow staircase little by little. I reached the basement floor of the second house and there, right in the center of the basement floor was another hole. And this time a ladder was already in place. Almost identical to the one I had used earlier. As if someone, or something, had placed the same one for me. What if it was there because I placed my ladder to reach down here?

The hole was much wider than the last one as I stepped closer to it. It was wider yet the attic I was looking into this time was much shorter then this one, maybe shorter than the one I actually owned on top..

This time though, nearing the edge the smell hit me harder than anything else. The stink of rotting wood and something sour and organic, made my stomach twist and turn a little. I covered my nose with my sleeve and leaned over shining my light into the pit. The space below glistened under the beam. Everything looked wet, drenched in something thick that shimmered like oil.

Maybe this was where the rainwater had drained. But that didn’t make sense, this second house would have soaked it up before it even reached the basement, hell whatever was down there didn’t look like it was soaked in water at all, more slime or mold.

My curiosity got the best of me as I began climbing down, ignoring every desperate plea my brain tried to make me stop. This house, the third one, was the opposite of the last. Where the second house was tall and thin, this one was short and wide. I had to crawl on all fours just to move around down there and the smell, oh god the smell was so bad. The attic ceiling was pressed downwards, forcing me to crawl to the pulled up staircase before I was free from it.

The air was thick and wet down here, covering my face was out of the question now with my arms drenched in whatever the hell this was as everything had a thin layer of mold or slime or…whatever the fuck it was, making my steps a little more slippery. I was in the hallway now, forcing me to dip my head slightly to avoid hitting the low ceiling. The walls were stretched outward now, wide and bloated. Warped like something swollen from the inside.

Again everything was where it should’ve been to the layout of my actual house. My furniture, my photos. But this time the distortion wasn’t just in shape. It was *texture*. The air smelled of mildew and decay. the furniture sagged. The floor squelched slightly beneath my feet and the photos were awful. My face was bloated and discolored. My eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of my face swelled over them like I was infected by something.

I made my way toward the final staircase, the one leading down to the basement and I heard it.

Breathing.

Slow, ragged, wet, a rattle of the throat like it was trying to clear something deep in its throat.

The sound grew louder with every step. It wasn’t just breathing, it was struggling with every breath it took like it was trying to stay alive. In a way it sounded like water was lodged in their lungs and every breath rattled it around in a sickening manner.

I descended carefully each step louder than the last, a slight squishing sound to go with them from the mold beneath my feet as I reached the bottom step, seeing the basement floor finally.

Someone or something was standing there, standing over what looked like another hole dead center to the basement.

It was hunched, shorter than me for sure. Its back was to me, looming over the other hole in the floor. Its body looked swollen and damp, its skin pale and blotchy, and its head  too big for its frame. The gurgled wheezing echoed off the walls as it shifted slightly.

Then it turned, its step made him jiggle just a little bit.

What I saw was…me, but it wasn’t me at the same time.

Its face was bloated and discolored, its eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of its face swelled over them. Its mouth slack and drool hangs in thick strands from its bloated lips. Its shirt was identical to mine, soaked and clinging to its sticky body, its eyes barely registered my presence at first.

“What the fuck...” I whispered, the words barely escaping my throat as I looked at whatever the hell this was in front of me.

It let out a sickening noise, a cross between a gargled yell and a cough. Its whole body shuddered before it started to move towards me, moving faster than I expected it to move.

Each step made its bloated skin shake from its footsteps, the bloated parts nearly covering its eyes shifting to its weight and gravity.

My body told me to run, run and don’t look back, my boots slipping across the slime coated floors as I scrambled up the staircase in a mad panic to get away from it. The gunk clinging to the surfaces and making every step a risk, I could barely keep traction.

I launched myself onto the pull down staircase as fast as I could, dragging myself upward on all fours like a scared animal clawing its way out of a trap. Behind me I heard the wet, slapping sounds of it following, its hand reaching up from the pull down staircase leading to the attic already. I felt fingers swipe at my ankle, slick and sticky but they slid off just as I hauled myself forward and to the hole in the attic

I could hear my own heartbeat ringing in my ears, my body buzzed with adrenaline and a blind panic coursing through every nerve in my body. That thing, that twisted, bloated *version* of me was chasing me and somehow catching up. I didn’t dare to look back, not wanting to see that thing catching up to me in any way.

If I can get to my actual house and pull the ladder up, I could prevent it from reaching me, no way for it to be able to climb up that distance I hoped. I was in the second house now, out of breath but I could still hear it following me as I raced to the staircase, reaching the hallway once again and climbing up the pull down staircase again. I was nearly out of there as I stood in the attic for a second.

I grabbed the ladder and started to climb like a mad man, reaching only half way up the ladder before I felt its hand grab me by the leg.*.* The entire ladder lurched in my hands, its weight suddenly doubled from the thing joining me on it. It held on to my leg, trying to pull me down with it as I struggled to keep a grip on the latter, my hands still slick with the third floor's slop.

I didn’t stop to fight it. I ran. I sprinted across the attic floor to the next pull-down staircase, yanked it open, and threw myself onto the steps, climbing as fast as my legs would carry me. The wood groaned beneath my weight. My fingers slipped on the wet rungs. I could hear the creature scuttling after me, faster than anything that heavy and bloated should’ve been able to move.

His hands were cold and rubbery, coated in something viscous that immediately soaked through my jean leg. It yanked hard, trying to drag me back down with it. I tried to pull away, holding on to the ladder the best I could, my other foot flailing around and trying to get back on to one of the steps of the ladder. The thing below snarled, breath bubbling like it was choking on vomit as it finally spoke out words I could understand.

“*Deeper...* DEEPER\*!\*” it gurgled, its voice broken and wet like it was speaking through a throat full of sludge.

“Get the fuck off me!” I shouted.

I twisted violently trying to break free and kicked down with my free foot aiming blind. I struck the left side of its face, my foot nearly sticking to its face as I raised it up again and brought it down on him again and again.

“Deeper!” It screamed at me before my foot smashed it in the jaw, a loud crack coming from my foot smashing into it again. With one final kick I felt the left side of his face give, almost like a grape being stepped on as the skin cracked open underneath my foot and his grip suddenly loosened as it fell to the floor beneath with a wet splat like a water balloon. The entirety of the left side of its face was broken up, gushing out blood and whatever fluids was stored inside of its body as it poured out around it, its body twitching as it laid on the floor beneath me.Looking down at it, a part of me wanted to make sure it was dead. Instead I pulled myself up into my actual basement, pulling the ladder up with me to make sure nothing else could come climbing up.

I didn’t know what the hell to do. My mind was on fire, spiraling on what I just witnessed, trying to make sense of what I had seen, what I had just killed\*.\* There were no answers that made any sense, just more questions piling up and clawing at the edge of my sanity. But through the noise, one thought cut through with terrifying clarity. What if something else could crawl up here? It may have been the panic I was in, it might have been the thought of more fucked up versions of me could be lingering down there, but in the end i decided to burn the place down with whatever I had on hand.

If nothing existed up here then there shouldn’t be anything down there right? It mirrored my home in every way before twisting it and making whatever the hell I just saw down there. It was the only thing that seemed to make sense in my mind at that moment.

I tore through the house grabbing anything flammable. Paper, lighter fluid, cans of spray, I even thought about getting gas from the tank of my car to pour everywhere but I would need it to get the hell out of here. The smell of chemicals filled the air, sharp and burning my throat as I spread everything I had everywhere. I didn’t care about damage or cost or consequence anymore, this house was cursed with things I couldn’t understand

I stood in the center of the living room for a moment as I readied the matches, my fingers trembling to get one of them lit before throwing it down, flames shooting up everywhere very quickly before I rushed out the door.

As the flames rushed through the house I made my way out the front door that somehow was already wide open. I didn’t remember leaving the front door open at all but I shook that thought out of my head as I ran to the car, igniting the engine to get the hell out of there as flames engulfed the house. I let the house burn behind me, never once looking back at it as I drove as fast and I could out of there like a bat out of hell. Looking back it now I could have done so many different things like call the police and have them see the hole for themselves and whatever fucked up thing was down there waiting for them, but as it stands I could care less now. I should be upset with burning my home down but I don’t, I really don’t after all of that.

I’ve been at this cheap hotel ever since, holed up in a room that smells like old wallpaper and cat piss. I haven’t slept or eaten much, my stomach just turns whenever I think of the third house down there.

My mind keeps going back to when I found that…thing in the basement, it was looking at another hole dead center of the basement. There was another house down there, maybe more messed up then the third one and who knows how many more beneath that one.

What bothered me even more was the fact that the third house had a messed up version of me, was there one for the second floor or did I get lucky? I thought I saw something but I looked everywhere when I was down there and spotted nothing but what if I missed it somehow?

I don’t know. I’ll probably never find out now and honestly, maybe that’s for the best.

Anyway, I’m done writing about this. Just trying to keep my head on  straight while I wait for the RCMP to show up. They will come eventually.

Hey there 👋

I'm a 33 year old guy from Michigan who enjoys the slower pace of life. Think cozy nights, spontaneous weekend adventures, and meaningful conversation over a good cup of coffee.

Weekdays are usually chill: a bit of work, some trash TV or sports, and winding down. But weekends? That’s when I’m out hiking, camping, checking out new restaurants, or collecting beach glass like it’s treasure.

I'm laid back, sarcastic in the fun way, and at my best when there's laughter and good energy. I’m looking to meet someone kind, witty, and open to getting to know each other at a natural pace—whether that leads to a friendship, companionship, or more down the line.

I’m 5'10"", athletic build, green eyes, brown hair, a rare social drinker, and don’t smoke. No kids, but I’m cool if you do.

If you enjoy the outdoors, deep convos, spontaneous road trips, or just someone to hang with and be your unfiltered self...shoot me a message!",1,1751071855.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1lma01a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lma01a,Old Stone Inn Boutique Hotel - Would not recommend!,"I stayed at this hotel from June 19th to 22nd with a group of friends, and while the location and some of the amenities were enjoyable, our experience overall was extremely disappointing — to the point of being concerning. When we first arrived, it was during a heat warning, and unfortunately, the room’s air conditioning had not been turned on, making it disgustingly hot inside. While the room appeared fairly clean at first glance, we immediately noticed one of the two water bottles provided had already been half-consumed, even though none of us had touched them. That evening, we walked to Clifton Hill, which was thankfully within good walking distance — a definite plus for the location. However, upon returning, we found there was less than half a roll of toilet paper in our bathroom. They had attempted to fold it decoratively, but it looked crumpled and poorly done, with no extra toilet paper in sight. By midnight, we had to call the front desk, only to be told they had run out of toilet paper entirely and wouldn’t have any until 7am. Absolutely unacceptable for any hotel. Later, when we tried to wind down for the night, the TV only played static on most channels, and we were barely able to find anything to watch. In terms of power access, there was only one available outlet, and the other was taken by the lamp and coffee maker. We ended up having to use an outlet in the powder room, which at least had a great magnifying mirror and working sink — a plus for three women sharing a room. On Friday, two more friends arrived and checked into the second room my friend had booked for them. It was even hotter that day, and their AC unit wasn’t working either. Even more disturbing was when they removed the front panel to inspect the unit and found a strip of green painter’s tape labeled “gas leak.” That was incredibly alarming. Later that evening, when getting ready for a winery tour, my friend had tried to take a shower but ended up standing in a foot of water due to a clogged drain. The shower handle was confusing and difficult to operate, which only added to the frustration.
By the next morning, our friends in the other room said they had barely slept because of the extreme heat. They also reported a foul odor in their room, and due to the sliding door not being openable, there was no ventilation at all. The smell worsened after we returned from the winery tour. The hotel did act quickly and sent a maintenance worker who confirmed the issue and offered to move them to another room, while trying to air the room out with the door open. Back in our room, I had attempted to shower, only to be standing in water yet again, and this time I noticed blonde and black hairs at the bottom of the tub — none of us have those hair colors, confirming the drain had not been cleaned properly. The water also took 20 minutes to drain. Upon checkout, our friends mentioned all of this to the front desk, and the only compensation offered was $34.99 for one night of free parking. Nothing else, despite all of the discomfort, heat, and being forced to move rooms. The friend who booked both rooms was outraged, and tried repeatedly to speak to a manager. She was also extremely concerned about the “gas leak” tape and reached out to multiple experts who agreed it could have been dangerous. The hotel’s only explanation was that it was related to an incident back in August 2024 — which did not explain why that tape was still inside a room in June 2025.She also later noticed a $17.99 per room, per night “facility fee” on the invoice — something to keep in mind.

Despite everything, there were some things we genuinely enjoyed about the hotel. The building itself has many Instagram-worthy aesthetics that made for fun photo opportunities, which we loved. While we didn’t use the pool personally, it looked clean and very inviting. The hotel’s location was ideal — incredibly close to food, Clifton Hill, and the Falls — and Ubers to other attractions were cheap and fast. We were even able to watch the fireworks from the Falls from right out front of the hotel, which was a really nice touch. The on-site restaurant serves breakfast and brunch and, although expensive, the quality was excellent. I have to mention the French press Starbucks coffee — $9 a pot may seem steep, but it was honestly the best coffee I’ve ever had.

There were a few logistical things worth noting that could impact other travelers. The side exits of the building allow you to exit, but you cannot re-enter the hotel through them, which means having to walk all the way around to the front entrance. This was a bit of a struggle for myself and my friend who is also disabled, so if mobility is a concern, I recommend parking near the front of the building if you anticipate needing to go back and forth to your car. Also, keep in mind that the rooms we stayed in had no mini fridge or microwave, so don’t plan to bring takeout back unless it doesn’t require refrigeration or heating.

Overall, this hotel has potential, and there are definitely parts of our stay we enjoyed — but unfortunately, the lack of basic necessities, poor maintenance, and dismissive customer service left us with a very negative experience.

In a fit of frustration I put my onion and garlic in my spice grinder, swearing I would throw it out after and buy one of the little processers I saw in Indian home kitchens. That didn't work either, so now:

1) what is a good wet/dry small volume tool for these pastes? About 2 C max.

So this is gonna be a long post. Not sure how to put my thoughts in writing as this is the first time I’m ever doing so.

First for a little backstory; I haven’t gotten along with my mom from my earliest of memories (which is becoming obsolete as I hardly remember anything from before a couple years ago) 
I’ve never been to a therapist/counselor for anything to do with my life because my mom told me that if a therapist ever told me that she was the root of my issues, she would come in there and punch her in the face.
Since I was a kid I’ve been told that “you’re fine stop crying” “I don’t wanna hear it go to your room” “that didn’t hurt shut up” so I’ve gone thru life (I’m 30) not knowing how to show emotion or go through emotions per say. I have never had a relationship with my parents that I wish I did. 
When I told my mom I was pregnant at 23 she wouldn’t even look at me. Was disgusted and judged me. 
I have NEVER been supported or felt supported. I like metal music and like to wear black and I have my own little niche style but it’s awful and ugly and “not dressing my age” to her… my hair black is ugly but blonde makes me look washed out, I’m fat or I’m too skinny… I have never been enough for her. Ever. She’s physically been abusive up until I was 27 she tried to back hand me.
My soulmate (that’s a different story) came into my life and kind of made me aware of how toxic she is & im not even telling y’all half of it on this post… but they hate him and won’t even let me speak his name. They throw away letters he writes me (he’s incarcerated) & my mom works for the post office so she thinks because I get mail at HER house that it’s HER right to either open my mail or toss it.
I have no rights in my life as a 30 year old. I tried going no contact and she manipulated her way back in. 
When I say they I mean her and my stepdad. 
They hold everything over my head. I baked cookies from scratch and they were mad when they didn’t get any because my daughter and my brother and I were tearing them up. They said that they can’t believe I have the audacity to cook food they bought with their dishes in their home. 
My life situation is fucked up and a long story. But I have no where else to go, I mean nowhere. Whatsoever. I don’t have a vehicle. They won’t let me drive their vehicles because I don’t have my license (it’s expired but I can’t go get a new one without a ride and they have been holding out on doing so for a power trip)
I also am a recovering addict (45 days sober) for the first time in 2 years. They only manipulated their way back into my life so they could see my daughter and now that they got that wish, I’m back to being treated like a disgusting piece of garbage beneath them. 
I feel stuck because if I try to go live somewhere else, I won’t be able to see my daughter (my mom picks her up and provides transportation for that & her dad has physical custody atm and most certainly won’t let me have her by myself) he’s another pos garbage human that I despise but that’s another topic.

I cook I clean I do everything for these people who wouldn’t do nearly the same for me. Example; I refill the coffee pods because it’s rude to them if I don’t but they never once filled mine back up ??! Like it’s stupid shit like that. 
I would absolutely go no contact but I can’t and it’s literally killing me. I’ve been thinking about just bouncing but I know I will relapse. I don’t want to lose what I’ve been working for the last month. I work so hard just to stay sober and being here is so toxic and just so bad that it makes me believe life would be better high than having to be around these miserable awful judgmental rude ass people. 
I forgot to mention that I don’t have a job because they won’t let me get one. I feel so fucking alone and lost. 
Do I reach out to my social worker from my doctors office? I seriously feel like I have no resources. 
Sorry for rambling because I don’t even know what I was really trying to accomplish with this post.
Has anyone else dealt with a similar circumstance? I feel like I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. 
I wanted to see if it was possible to go to a sober living but Im not sure if that’s a thing since I wouldn’t be coming from or doing a detox?? 
I’m on MAT brixadi weekly injections so I am sober… 
Idk. But if anyone is going to post something rude on this thread, please just don’t. I really just want support so badly right now",1,1751070687.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False
1lm9oau,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lm9oau/transitioning_from_sdr_to_sales_enablementld_am_i/,Transitioning from SDR to Sales Enablement/L&D - am I reaching?,"
I’m a 27F who “magically” joined a well-known tech company in 2022. I applied for a Sales Development role on a whim & had no established connections within the org, but had great interviews! I was SO excited as I’d long admired this company.

About 6 months into the role, things started hitting the fan in my personal life. This significantly impacted my work performance to the point that I was on an informal performance plan/PIP and chose to explore a medical leave almost a year into my tenure. 

I spent ~6 months on leave, came back to a PIP, KILLED the PIP all while acting as a go-to for 3 new hires.. I didn’t even know if I was going to have a job at the end of the month.. 

Post-PIP, I went back on leave for another ~5 months to engage in a PHP/IOP therapy program.. In an effort to end this spiral. I really wanted this to work out for me.. 

Hindsight is 20/20. Now, I recognize that I was being resilient to a fault and trying to force something.. I was just convinced that it was a ME problem, not the role or environment - especially when I successfully taught other people my process and how to be successful on the job.. 

During my second leave, I learned that it is highly likely that I have inattentive ADHD. Provided this new insight, I began working diligently with my care team to tailor my meds and continue care after the program so that my inconsistent performance wouldn’t continue. Again, thinking this is all due to my mental health. Like.. I “know” that I can do the job, but I can’t be consistent in it to save my life!!!

I returned to work in November, but not in my immediate role until April. Between Nov-April, I supported various teams - coaching teams outside of Sales Development, supporting our Sales Enablement team with content and insights.. I was even invited to facilitate the early stage interviews for an emerging team.. 

I felt truly in my element when I was coaching, facilitating, creating, advising.. My confidence was coming back. I felt GREAT. I began having coffee chats around making that transition within the company, skills needed, etc. 

Until April.. “Not eligible for internal mobility until October” due to my previous performance, etc. Mind you, despite missing the equivalent of ~1-3 weeks out of each quarter, I’ve never achieved less than 97% of my quota. 

I‘ve been having a decent quarter since rejoining my immediate team in April 2025, but I just had to be honest with myself.. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t feel like I’m growing. I truly enjoy and become energized by “enabling” others. I don’t see a path for myself here..

Now.. Here I am, job searching. Any tips for leveraging my experience to go into tech sales enablement? Am I aiming too high since I’m coming from a SD role?",1,1751070665.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1lm9o4g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lm9o4g,Our little coffee corner ☕,"Almost 6 years into this home brewing hobby, and I’m finally getting to slowly build up our little coffee corner at home ☺️

My original plan was to go for all stainless/aluminum shelves, the minimalist and industrial vibes, but they were all so expensive so I went with these IKEA shelves instead, and honestly, I ended up really liking how they turned out. What do you think?

I’m thinking of adding some artwork (maybe on the right side?), but it kinda feels a bit cluttered already… Thing is, I don’t even have that much gear (or do I? 😅) so I’m not sure what to take off..

I’m also planning to get an espresso machine next year (the Cafelat Robot would look amazing here — but my parents like milk drinks, so we might need something else). and we’ll probably need another table at that point 😄

Anyway, I’m liking how it looks. I even work at the dining table beside it now instead of at my desk in the room just to be near it, you know in case of caffeine emergency 😆

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve the setup,layout, storage, aesthetics — I’d really love to hear them! ☺️

So his is my first time having a guy friend. So I (17f) have known let’s call him Jake (18m) since I was a freshman. We were in wind ensemble together for two years. I was a sophomore when he graduated. He is now a college freshman. Recently we have gotten quite close when he came home for the summer. We’ve chatted a lot over instagram. He followed me. Then eventually I got his number. We chatted about things from band drama to politics, to philosophical debates and ethical concerns.

We are both huge nerds and will recommend each other books and media. Eventually I asked him if he wanted to get a coffee with me sometime. (I didn’t specify but I assumed as friends). We’ve been to coffee twice in the last 3 weeks and have chatted on the phone.

One time I told him about my boyfriend (which I got dumped by recently) and he started asking several questions. Which I think is normal. And then told me when he likes a girl or a guy he doesn’t make moves because he’s afraid of rejection. (He’s bi) or something like that.

We’ve talked for about 2 hours on our coffee runs and we will walk along the lake in our town and chat. He’s also invited me to go to the docs near the lake with his younger brother.
 
I honestly have no idea how I feel about him. I am open to a relationship, but chill with just staying friends. But I’m not going to risk our friendship.
I honestly might be so stupid, and this is completely normal. But I overthink and I’m not used to having guy friends.",0,1751070576.0,AskMenAdvice,5,0.5,False

I’m often shocked about tipping being asked at ice cream, coffee shops, etc, but I’m specifically curious about service people. 

I’ve seen advices not to tip cleaning people, or service people like Task Rabbit/ Thumbtack since they set their own rate, but you can give them if you want to. However, massage people, nail technicians often expect tip regardless. And then people usually give their mail person/ garbage person bonus gift during holiday season, but not regular tip.

Is there a reason for this? What are the general expectations for this? What’s the general tipping practice that you follow?",1,1751070520.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,0.67,False

The advent of the internet has done in a lot of the mall-going experience.  Yet I doubt the indoor mall will ever go away completely.  There are some things that you just can't get online, or even if you can it can be better to get them in person.

What do you think it would take to bring about a ""mall revival"", so to speak, where we see new indoor malls opening and being successful?  What might successful future malls look like?  What will they have to offer?  And besides that, what sort of cultural / legal / economic changes might bring about a mall revival?

I think a possible future for malls might revolve more around services and activities.  Grocery stores as anchors rather than department stores.  Perhaps more cafes, coffee shops, and the like instead of just a food court.  Maybe fitness centers and spas.  And the little various knick-knack stores will still be there inbetween, grabbing foot traffic.

I dunno if it'd work - maybe it's already been tried and it's failed - but it's a thought of what future malls might be.

I think a return of the ""free-range kid / free-range teenager"" might also contribute to mall culture, where kids are kind of just allowed to be on their own without immediate adult supervision, and the mall is a place to hang out (and spend allowance money).

Any thoughts?  What do you think it would take to see a mall revival?",4,1751070467.0,deadmalls,6,1.0,False

An Icecream truck suddenly pulls up right at the mansion. The guard exhales, what the hell is an Icecream truck doing here? His earpiece begins to speak. ""Control to Gate. Motion-detectors are sensing the presence of a vehicle."" The guard responds. ""Control, this is Gate. Yeah, it's an ice-cream truck."" There is a sudden reply. ""The client has requested no visitors. It is not allowed."" The guard replies. ""Yeah I know, I'll get rid of him."" The guard walks up to the ice-cream truck and out of sight of the cameras, the driver seat empty, the shutters of the ice-cream van store opening to reveal the ice cream man, who looks surprisingly serious for his occupation. The guard walks up to the ice cream man, putting his hands on his belt. ""Hey, get outta here. We don't want a- The Ice Cream man pulls the guard by the collar into the ice cream van, the guard due to the force is pulled face first onto the floor, where the man uses his hand to chop the back of the guard's neck, knocking the guard out. The Ice Cream man begins to undress himself, removing his apron, his shirt, trousers and hat and puts it into the empty freezer. He then begins to undress the guard, putting on his shoes, trousers, belt, shirt, tie, suit jacket, radio and ear piece, and puts the unconscious almost naked guard into the freezer, locking it. He then reverses the Ice Cream van several meters behind some trees, before turning it off, and walking out, dressed as the guard, he grabs the radio and responds, ""Control, this is Gate. The Ice Cream truck has been responded to. It has left."" The radio responds swiftly, ""Gate, this is Control. Affirmative."" The Ice Cream Man, now dressed as a guard, walks out of the Ice Cream Van, and towards the gate. He notices the cameras, so he decides to go left into the garden instead, where he sees another guard in a suit, walking around. The man hides behind an old well, then behind a rock formation, where he picks up a wrench. The guard is walking around, talking to himself. ""Man... This is shit. Anybody could just walk in here. Surveillance cameras, motion detec- \*\*CLANG\*\* The guard turns around and finds a wrench had just caused a bunch of buckets to fall down onto the ground from a pallet. ""Huh?"" the guard lets out as he sees the commotion. A wrench? When did that get there? He walks over to the collapsed pile of buckets, just as the man sneaks through a pathway that the guard had previously paid his attention too. The man walks into another part of the garden, where he sees a guard leaning against a greens bin, on the phone. The guard begins to speak. ""Hello? Hello? Yeah, I know it's the client's call and all, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Calling in personnel from local outfits? We barely have time to do proper background checks!"" The guard leans off the bin, and begins to walk around, while talking. ""Give me a break. I need to check criminal history, mental history, I basically have to check how many- The guard walks away, allowing the man to simply sneak past and onto an empty tennis court, where he quickly sneaks through a stairway into another part of the garden. The man keeps sneaking, eventually sneaking into some sort of barbeque shelter, where a guard leans against a cobblestone wall, on call as well, smiling and laughing. Guard: ""Don't tell anyone, but I'm not supposed to know about the \*Head\* stuff. Personally, I think it's old school."" The man quietly leaps over the cobblestone wall behind the guard, and keeps sneaking his way through the compound. He walks through the garden and across a small bridge that goes over a mini waterfall, a guard leans over the side looking down at the waterfall, smoking a cigarette. The man just walks past, as the guard isn't even guarding the bridge, and through a small door into a hillside balcony. Two guards walk into the hillside balcony, forcing the man to hide behind an outdoor kitchen counter. The man then swiftly moves behind a big couch, also in the centre. There are two couches facing eachother. Guard 1#: ""You swing by the kitchen today? Looks like chef's cooking up a storm."" Guard 2# ""Mmm. I tell you. This gig is like watching paint dry, but at least the service is good."" The second guard walks by the couch the man is, the man quickly moves to the second couch, so that the guard doesn't see him behind the first couch. The first guard, looking at the hillside, turns to face the first guard, but the man quickly rolls to the other side of the couch, so that he's behind the view of the first guard and out of sight of the second. The second guard begins to walk to join the first guard, and the man quickly sneaks out of the hillside balcony and into another part of the garden. The man walks into the garden again and notices a green house entrance. A gardener is filling up pots with soil and putting expensive flowers in them, a guard is leaning against a guardrail, with that guardrail being part of a small platform that leads into a greenhouse. The guard says, ""Just heard. Redwood's taking security personnel only. As of now, garden personnel are no longer allowed in the house. The gardener replies, cutting open a new soil bag, ""Man. I've gardened for two ex-presidents and even the secret service were less uptight. I wonder what she's so frightened of?"" The man simply walks past the two, as the guard is paying attention to the gardener's reply. The man walks into the Green House and turns left, hiding behind a planter. A guard walks through the Green House, his back towards the Man. The man begins to follow the guard, while still using the planter as cover to prevent other guards from seeing him. The guard walks into a small space within the greenhouse, where two other guards are talking. The man follows, moving past the small group from behind a planter, he overhears a brief conversation. Guard 1# says, ""As far as I know the girl hasn't left the house since we got here. No school, no friends comin' over. Bit odd, don't ya think?"" Guard 2# replies, ""I don't know, maybe."" Guard 1# says, ""Kid's sweet enough, don't get me wrong, but something is definitely off."" The man walks through a glass bridge within the greenhouse, one that reveals more greenery aswell as an indoor water fountain to the left, before walking into a technical area of the Green House, filled with some sorts of machinery and wall panels within an enclosed room. The man looks around and finds the wall panel keys just on the desk inside. He picks it up and uses it to open the water pressure panel. He opens it and sets the water pressure on valve one to full, before calmly walking out of the technical area, and crouching behind a planter. Two guards and a gardener are chatting next to the exit of the Greenhouse. Guard 1# of the group says, ""I think what's most prevalent are all the lady boys and the stray dogs just humpin' on the- The increased water pressure causes water to suddenly fall from every water sprinkler on valve 1, spraying the entire right side of the green house with water, which is where the exit, both guards and the gardener scowl in annoyance. Guard 1#, ""Uh- Perfect, just perfect... I'm gonna kill those maintenance clowns."" Everyone quickly gets out the way of the water. Guard #2, ""Nah, Ms. Redwood pays them a week in advance. Come on, let's check out the boats."" The Gardener turns left back into the greenhouse, both the guards walk past the water and outside the greenhouse, with the man quietly following the two guards outside. The guards walk outside into another part of the garden, seems to be where plants and flowers are stored and grown. The two guards walk up to the ledge and look out towards the bay, where they put their hands on their belts and look out at the distant yachts and boats along the pink-toned sunset sky. Guard 1#, ""What I would do for a view like that every day."" Guard 2# walks beside him. Guard 2# replies, ""Well, I'd settle happily for a roof over my head, you know? I've been- The man quietly walks past the two, up some stairs into the flower pot section, where he meets a dead end, just a brick wall and nothing but the ridge going several tens of meters into the shallow ocean below. The man stops. He calmly replaces the security radio he has and throws it into the ocean, grabbing a different radio and connecting the security earpiece onto it. He speaks into the radio. ""I'm through the compound. Accessing mansion. Approaching target."" The man quickly then steps onto the thin ledge of the brick wall and begins to slide himself along it, just inches away from falling to his death. As he moves, there is a window along the wall, so he suddenly turns around and jumps backwards gently, he falls a bit, but he captures himself on the ledge again with his hands, and gently drops himself onto another ledge that is along the brick wall. He continues to move along this ledge. He receives a brief response. ""Received. Continue mission. Confirming. The girl is not to be harmed. The Handler is to be terminated. Out."" The man passes by the window from the ledge underneath, so he jumps up and grabs the ledge above him, and swiftly pulls himself back up, where he continues to move along, where he encounters an open window, where he can hear a guard talking on the phone, leaning from the window. The guard says, ""What!? Are you kidding me? Are you sure?"" ... ""It's not prostate cancer?"" The guard chuckles. Holy shit... I mean that is great news, oh man, you made my day, doc. Yeah, thanks doc, I thought I was a goner."" ... ""Yeah. Well, I gotta run, Doc. Duty calls. And-and thank you so much, you have a nice day too, okay, bye... Whoo! Nobody can piss off me today!"" The guard walks away from the open window, where the man swiftly jumps through and into a balcony, where he swiftly hides behind an outdoor counter. The guard who was speaking earlier walks towards the other side of the balcony and pulls out a cigarette, and begins to smoke. A second guard who is in the balcony shouts to him, ""Hey! You know the client doesn't want smoking around the house!"", the guard whose smoking replies, ""I don't care, you can't piss me off today!"" The guard exhales and begins to walk towards the smoking guard, ""Come on, what's the matter with you? You're a soldier for christ's sake, your body is a temple..."" which allows the man to swiftly access the door he was guarding, entering a hallway. He looks left and further along the hallway, he sees two guards and a camera, so he turns right. He's had proper intelligence regarding the layout, the security control room is actually just right here. He walks up to the door and notices that it's locked from the inside, with no way in. He calmly just knocks on the door. ""Coming!"" shouts the controller inside. The controller opens the door, and the man pushes the door open into the controller's head, sending the controller back. The man left hooks the controller in the throat steadily, forcing his throat tighten, as he gargles for air. The man puts his hand on his collarbone and pushes him down onto his knees, before kneeing the controller in the nose, knocking the controller out cold. The man turns around and closes the door, locking it. The man walks up to the security room's terminals, it's still unlocked from when the controller was using it. He simply goes onto the terminal, and de-activates the failsafe alarms of when security systems are down. He then just turns the cameras and the motion sensors off. He then shuts down the terminal to prevent re-activation of those systems. He drags the controller's unconscious body and uses some handcuffs he found in the security room to restrain him, before putting him in a gun locker cabinet, closing it tight. The man then simply walks out a second door into the main mansion complex.

The man walks into a hallway, where he sees a guard walking past into the living room of the mansion, on his cellphone. The guard says, ""Sounds like a team briefing in the living room."" ... ""Better haul ass. The Head hates having to repeat himself."" The guard walks into the living room Atrium, the man quietly shadowing behind him, before sneaking behind a couch, as the guard joins him and his team around the Head of Security, who is in an expensive suit and tie, and holding a cup of coffee, which he sets down on a winebar that is inside the living room Atrium. The Head of Security begins to speak, his voice serious and military, ""Listen up. Miss Redwood is in the upstairs shower and will be down shortly. The girl is in her room and will remain so for the time being. For those of you who do not know the drill- The man sneaks through, using the couches and balcony walls for cover, before reaching a doorway that leads into a staircase. He walks through and stays in the staircase, eyeing up a guard who is leaning on the second floor interior balcony, listening to the briefing happening in the living room. The Head of Security's booming voice can be heard, ""You will not, I repeat not, leave your HVI's side for any reason during your shift. Any breach of procedure will result in immediate termination and subsequent blacklisting. Rest assured, if you fail in your duties, you will never work in this business again. That is all. Dismissed."" The team of guards in the living room begin to disperse, as does the guard who was leaning on the interior balcony, allowing the man to move forward, through the balcony and quietly tail the guard who was leaning on the balcony railing. The guard walks into a small corridor, and turns left down some stairs. The man turns right into an empty large bathroom. He walks over to one of the built-in wooden cabinets and opens it, taking two tubs of 60 sleeping pills, putting it into his pocket. He walks out of the bathroom and down the stairs the guard went down, back into the hallway that he started in. He walks straight forward and into the kitchen, hiding behind a kitchen counter, where the sounds of fierce chopping, gas hobs, and boiling soup can be heard. A Guard and the Cook are inside. The guard says, his arms crossed, ""Come on... You can tell me."" The chef replies guarded, ""This recipe is a trade secret handed down from master to apprentice for centuries. You are not worthy of being an apprentice. I shall take the secret ingredient with me to the grave if I must."" The guard replies, ""Uh-huh... Is it salt?"" The chef says offended, ""No. No! What do you take me for!? Salt? Please! I am one of the finest chefs in this culinary wasteland you call a nation. You put liquid butter on your popcorn and you have the nerve to make assumptions about my award winning recipes? Shame! Shame on you, sir. Now, go on - get out of here! Shuuh shuh shuh!"" The guard says, ""All right, all right. Relax. I was only joking. Christ, don't have a heart attack."" The guard waltz away, chuckling. The chef muttering to himself, ""Go guard a gate or shoot some beer cans... Big ape... Sacrebleu."" The chef walks over to another kitchen counter and begins to cut some meat with a knife into cubes. The man sneaks over to the middle kitchen island and stays there. The chef moves over to the otherside of the kitchen, and the man moves along the middle kitchen island to avoid being seen. Just as he is behind the chef, he moves past him and out the kitchen, in the direction of the guard that waltz' away, and into the inside of the winebar, he looks up and notices the Head of Security on the other side of the Atrium, ordering more patrols of the garden over the radio. So the man grabs the tubs of sleeping pills, and crushes the pills into a fine powder. He quietly grabs the coffee and using the winebar for cover, he puts around 120 crushed sleeping pills into the cup of coffee, where he puts the lid back on, and puts it right where it was. The man sneaks back into the hallway, where he sneaks into another hallway near to a bathroom, and hides behind a halfwall, where he hears two guards chatting. Guard #1 says, ""Better to be safe then sorry. Forget it. Seriously, pour some ice cubes down your pants."" The two guards begin to walk down the hallway, and the man begins to wait behind the halfwall. He knows the bathroom here is the most convenient bathroom for any persons who may be feeling unwanted effects, especially for someone who wants to project a sharp and serious image to their staff. After a short few minutes, the Head of Security appears down the hallway the guards went, stumbling slightly, his serious posture-straight-up walk slowly fading. The man walks into the bathroom, leaving it dark and unlocked. ""Arrgh... cramps... Need to sit... just for a moment... nobody is going to know..."" says the Head of Security. The Head of Security pushes the bathroom door open to see the man, who hits the Head of Security in the neck with a precise chop of his hand. The Head of Security immediately falls to the ground, unconscious. The man searches through the Head of Security's pockets, and grabs his keycard. He walks out the bathroom, and closes the bathroom door, before pulling the door handle up, breaking it, and preventing it from being opened. The man sneaks back into the kitchen, where the chef is diligently chopping lettuce on the other side of the kitchen. The man quietly sneaks past the kitchen, without the chef even knowing, and back into the hallway, where he heads back into the hallway. He sees two guards chatting in the living room Atrium, no one is guarding the hallway, so he heads up the staircase and onto the second floor interior balcony, where he moves along it quietly to not alert the guards of his presence. He walks through an opening and towards a door that requires a keycard. He swipes the Head of Security keycard and opens the door, walking inside.

He walks into an L Hallway. A bookshelf in front of him, the man turns left and up some stairs, and presses his earpiece. ""Closing in on target."" he says briefly. He receives a brief response, ""Received. Continue mission."" The man walks into a balcony which is unguarded. He walks through the balcony and climbs onto the ledge, and begins to slide through it, his back against the wall, almost hanging off of the side of the house. He reaches an open window, the sound of a shower's stream... He quietly enters the bathroom. He spots a woman, showering within a glass shower enclosure, her back turned to him, gently washing her hair, which she slides along her wet hands. The man grabs his pistol from the guard's holster, a silenced AMT Hardballer. The man aims his pistol at the woman, the woman begins to turn around, her eyes meeting the man, ""Wait."" she says trying to put her hands up. \*\*GLASS SHATTER\*\* A .45 caliber bullet exits the barrel, piercing the glass, and hits the woman right above her heart. She falls through the glass enclosure, falling onto the hard bathroom floor, her blood pooling, her breath wavering, as the silent man walks towards the body, glass crinkling as he steps. He looks down upon the woman's naked body, aiming his pistol right at her head, looking into her eyes. The woman seems to have accepted her fate, her naked back having fallen on glass shards, and a .45 bullet in her chest. Despite the pain and stiffled moans, she manages to look at the man. The man's grip shakens slightly, his dead eyes widening for the first time in awhile, as he gently pulls his pistol to the side. ""I should kill you. Why did you do this?"" the man asks. The woman says, despite her gritting through her pain, her voice is soft and calming, ""We all have our limits. Even you. We used to have honour."" The man kneels down, gently grabbing her hand, ""Amelia, I..."" Amelia interrupts him, ""No. I had to take her away from the doctors. I knew you would understand.""

About 6 months into the role, things started hitting the fan in my personal life. This significantly impacted my work performance to the point that I was on an informal performance plan/PIP and chose to explore a medical leave almost a year into my tenure. 

I spent ~6 months on leave, came back to a PIP, KILLED the PIP all while acting as a go-to for 3 new hires.. I didn’t even know if I was going to have a job at the end of the month.. 

Post-PIP, I went back on leave for another ~5 months to engage in a PHP/IOP therapy program.. In an effort to end this spiral. I really wanted this to work out for me.. 

Hindsight is 20/20. Now, I recognize that I was being resilient to a fault and trying to force something.. I was just convinced that it was a ME problem, not the role or environment - especially when I successfully taught other people my process and how to be successful on the job.. 

During my second leave, I learned that it is highly likely that I have inattentive ADHD.

Name: miko Inaba.   Mi-(beauty) ko-(child) miko-(beautiful child) in-(cause/reason) ba-(banner) inaba-(banner of cause)

Age: 17

Year: 2nd

Grade: grade 1

Height: 5'4

Appearance: Miko is a petite girl with short, black hair. She has a slim build but little to no muscles. Most of her power comes from a high cursed energy output. She wears her uniform properly when she is excorzing curses. Outside of work, she wears casual wear mostly baggy hoodies and jeans.

Personality: Miko is a reserved, soft-spoken, and private person who struggles with social interactions and embarrasses easily. Though she has few friends, she is warm-hearted, emotionally sensitive, and deeply caring. Diligent and responsible, she excels in her studies and enjoys spending her free time reading mystery novels and playing video games. She values solitude and often dedicates time to studying or her personal hobbies. She loves coffee, visiting her favorite cafe rach day before going to jujutsu high. Miko is a very dedicated Sorcerer, one of the best in the modern era other than gojo satoru, kenjaku and ryomen sukuna. Miko was taught how to lie by aoi todo who was her teacher. Miko grew a bit detached without her friends, because the higher ups found her best when they needed a defective Sorcerer or curse user to die. Despite her technique, Miko does not believe in karma.

Base technique: karmic retribution.

Miko calls the base technique ""prarabdha"" which is karma being collected in one moment. This technique is first activated once miko snaps her fingers. This enters miko into a counter state that lasts 1 second. If she is attacked during this period, the attacker has their attack reflected into the same spot for equal damage. Miko is invulnerable during this period. The damage that is reflected is not the damage dealt to miko, but the damage that would have occurred if they hit themselves with their own attack. During this period, she cannot attack anything without the counter. This technique has a 10 second cooldown.

Binding vow: No mercy, No shield

This binding vow removes the seconds of invulnerability, in return for miko doing extra damage when she counters.

Extentions: 

Agami (current actions that cause karma to be collected later): this delays the counter hitting an attacker for 1.2 seconds, allowing miko to attack before the counter hits.

Sanchita (past karma): this redirect the counter to another target. Used best against multiple enemies.

Reversal, good karma: This reversal instead of countering an attack, it increases miko's cursed energy output for 5 seconds. It increases more depending on the strength of the attack.

[Hollow technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/s/r3UCtnE8S3) (hollows are way easier in her world) madhyama pratipad: this technique uses up almost all of her Cursed energy to use. She snaps both fingers, activating the counter state. In this counter state, if she is attacked the attacker will be hit by their attack three times over at extra base strength depending on the power of the attack she was hit by. It grows exponentially with power.

Cursed tools: 

""Moment of clarity"" is a necklace with beads on it that glow red. Once per fight these beads can restore her cooldown

""Karma's echo"" is a dagger with three stars on it. Once somebody is cut by the dagger they become marked. If a marked target attacks miko both will get hit at the same time. The counter is weaker than if miko snapped. Karma's echo has three charges.

1lm98yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/1lm98yq/psa_i_got_scammed_in_shanghai_by_a_tantan_date/,"[PSA] I got scammed in Shanghai by a Tantan date – lost 13,000 RMB, got 9,000 RMB back, still hoping for a Revolut chargeback","**My Scam Story in Shanghai – how I got tricked by a girl I met on Tantan into spending over 13,000 RMB (I managed to recover 9,000 in cash, but I'm still down 600 USD if Revolut doesn't approve my chargeback):**

On the 8th day of my trip to China, I arrived in Shanghai. It was my second day in the city, and I decided to meet someone casually through a dating app – nothing romantic or sexual, just to connect with someone and maybe learn more about the culture. I downloaded **Tantan**. In Shanghai it felt like ""reverse Tinder"" compared to Europe – I got around 300 likes and several matches. I replied to one girl who messaged me first. She asked if we could meet for food.

I had never read any warnings or posts about this kind of scam and never expected I could be ripped off like this. I agreed to meet her outside a metro station on Changping Road, as she instructed. The meeting seemed very normal. Her English was good, she acted like a regular, nice girl. And I was under the impression that China is cheap overall. We started walking, and she led the way – which I found odd, since I usually lead, but figured she knew the area better and wanted to help.

After 15–20 minutes, she suggested a restaurant. It looked like a basic place – nothing fancy. We were seated in a **small private room**. I'm convinced it may have been the same place as this user described in his post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/1e658mx/i\_got\_scammed\_on\_my\_first\_day\_in\_shanghai/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/1e658mx/i_got_scammed_on_my_first_day_in_shanghai/)

I looked at the menu (I'll attach pictures – the prices there are high). The first few pages looked normal. There was only one menu. After browsing a few pages, she grabbed it and started flipping through quickly, then placed the order herself.

We got food (looked like crab?) and a bottle of champagne showed up. It was consumed very quickly. Then came another. I was surprised how fast she drank but didn’t think too much of it. I was expecting a bill around 500 RMB max. By the third bottle (maybe even fourth), I asked, ""Wait – how much will this cost?"" Suddenly a waitress appeared with a bill – over **18,000 RMB** (\~2,500 USD).

I was in shock. The girl said she could cover about 5,000 RMB, so I had to pay the remaining **13,000+ RMB**. I was stressed and panicking. Surveillance cameras everywhere, unfamiliar country, waitress watching over me, so I just paid via Alipay. Oddly, they also had a credit card terminal.

Including Alipay fees, I paid over 13,000 RMB. I didn’t take the bill with me – I was dazed and ashamed. I didn’t immediately realize it was a scam. The girl said this was ""normal in China"" and that dating there was all about showing money.

Later, I got suspicious. I remembered a girl I matched with later on Tantan who wanted to go for drinks. When I described the situation to her, she immediately said: **""This sounds like the 'Shanghai Game' scam"".** That's when I found Reddit posts confirming my experience.

Next day I knew I had to act fast. I only had one day left in Shanghai before flying to Japan. I went back to Changping Road to find the restaurant. GPS logs helped, but walking navigation in China is tricky (maybe due to different satellite systems?). After searching for 3+ hours, I finally found it. I took photos of the outside and the menu.

A young guy came up to me asking if I was the guy from yesterday. Then he brought the manager. I knew I was in the right place. I told them I wanted my money back. At first, they offered 5,000 RMB. I said I'd go to the police and do a credit card chargeback. After some back and forth, they agreed to give me **9,000 RMB in cash**.

I accepted. Better than nothing.

I didn’t go to the police that day – I should have, but I didn’t want to risk anything with my flight the next day. The restaurant manager denied knowing the girl or any scam, but I don’t believe it – especially after how fast she downed that champagne and how the staff reacted.

The scam was professional. She didn’t look like a 20-year-old bait – she seemed real. I'm 36, she was maybe 30. I wasn’t expecting danger.

Ironically, the girl who warned me on Tantan about the scam invited me to Starbucks... but I ignored her messages after that. In her final message she just said: ""scam"". Maybe she was also part of it.

One more observation: many Tantan girls would vanish around 8–9 pm each day, as if they were ""on shift"". I don't think all Tantan girls are part of this, but it’s clearly not a rare scam – it might even be the dominant one in Shanghai.

I wrote this post obviously to warn others, but I also hope to get the rest of the money back via **Revolut**.

I wanted to post the exact location of this restaurant... I paid through Alipay and initially received 9,000 RMB back via Alipay. I returned that amount and took the cash instead, since I wouldn’t be able to withdraw it from Alipay. I'm aware that this post – and this whole subreddit – may be monitored by people associated with this restaurant. The refund of 9,000 RMB was fair under the circumstances, especially after I said I'd go to the police and file a chargeback. My personal info is known, but I want to remain anonymous – that's why I'm not posting the exact restaurant location here, even though I could. Let's call it a small security measure.

I’m also not sharing screenshots of the chat or the girl’s Tantan profile photo. I hope this is a fair deal. The amount is significant for me, and so is the rest of the refund I’m hoping for via Revolut. I'm only attaching photos of the restaurant and the menu.

Then eventually I got his number. We chatted about things from band drama to politics, to philosophical debates and ethical concerns.

We are both huge nerds and will recommend each other books and media. Eventually I asked him if he wanted to get a coffee with me sometime. (I didn’t specify but I assumed as friends). We’ve been to coffee twice in the last 3 weeks and have chatted on the phone.

One time I told him about my boyfriend (which I got dumped by recently) and he started asking several questions. Which I think is normal. And then told me when he likes a girl or a guy he doesn’t make moves because he’s afraid of rejection. (He’s bi) or something like that.

We’ve talked for about 2 hours on our coffee runs and we will walk along the lake in our town and chat. He’s also invited me to go to the docs near the lake with his younger brother.

1lm96jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1lm96jj/lego_movie_instruction_theory/,Lego movie instruction theory,"This theory was extremely inspired by Alex bale’s theories.
I always looked at bricksburg from the lego movie and how perfect it was. I always thought it was because of instructions but we have instructions in real life (AKA laws, they’re not as extreme as the ones in the Lego movie) but what’s strange is the Lego movie doesn’t have any citizens who break the rules. But why?

I think lord business kills any citizens who break the rules (I know it sounds crazy but hear me out)

In the Lego movie it is shown that octan has tons of ways to keep track of the citizens of bricksburg such as a bunch of security cameras to catch any rule breakers and take them out using bad cop and the robots. Another way I think lord business keeps track of the citizens using spies planted in society. I think one of the spies is the coffee shop owner because it’s a rule to “drink overpriced coffee” and they have a database of all citizens so they can find who doesn’t show up therefore breaking the rules. Another character I felt was suspicious was surfer dave. What we saw of bricksburg was completely landlocked with there being actual walls for the borders of the city. Also surfer Dave is very different from all of the other citizens and he’d make more sense in cloud kookoo land. So am I suggesting surfer Dave is a master builder who sold out his master builder partners? Maybe I think it makes more sense that surfer Dave is a minifigure that Finn put in his dad’s model but whatever.

But another thing is… why is lord business doing this? I think it’s to keep everything functioning. Maybe it’s like Lego instructions where if you mess up a step it hurts the set majorly. But why does when emmet doesn’t follow a rule he immediately finds the piece of resistance. He didn’t report wyldstyle when the instructions said “if you see anything weird, report it immediately” and then he fell in the hole and found the piece. 
This is kinda unrelated but the song “everything is awesome” is played everywhere throughout the city and tells the citizens nothing is wrong.

There is one thing that could destroy this entire theory. It’s the fact that the Lego movie is all just Finn’s playing with legos, so why would he imagine lord business killing his own citizens? Well I mean he did freeze everyone but that’s just a metaphor for Finn’s dad using glue. So it’s  gonna take something ground breaking to keep this theory alive, something like direct evidence. Well I have evidence. Lord business literally says “let’s take extra care to follow the instructions, or you will be put to sleep.” That’s right, there is direct proof of this theory in the Lego movie. Well this all could still be Finn playing with legos, I mean lord business is his dad portrayed as an evil villain so it makes sense to make this villain extremely evil. I mean he did freeze the city.",1,1751069215.0,FanTheories,0,1.0,False

They bring the vehicle over to the Occult headquarters, where they invite the children to clean the vehicle, and also paint it black. The colour of the Organization. The kids had a fun time before the vehicle is left to dry, a Garmin DriveSmart 76 satnav is placed in the driver side door pocket, and then driven over to a parking garage in Irvington, where they leave the vehicle in a specific parking spot, before being picked up by two more missionaries in a Calais. A White Calais appears outside the The Green House Preschool and Kindergarten at Fort Lee. It's home time, and children are getting picked up by their parents, they laugh and talk about their days without a worry in the world. Except for one, a single mother of two picks her five year old up from the Kindergarten, she juggles her responsibilities around, multi-tasking both her kids and job. A pre-occupied and distracted parent. The perfect target. The two Missionaries watch very closely, tailing the small family, which happens over the next week. Occult Clerics fold a letter. A note which reads, ""The father hands his kin to his servants, unaware of their incompetence. The kin vanishes, and out of rage and desperation, sends his servants into the forest to search in vain."", and a key. The locker key for the locker at the Central Terminal, and put the letter in a safe. Occult pre-intelligence determines that the mother has two kids, is quite empathetic, is a nurse, and after pre-school, usually goes to the store to get a few groceries or a snack for her five year old. The Missionaries are quite peckish for this plan. Another cell of Missionaries had scouted out local clinics, having an insider within the clinic give them information on Epileptics throughout the area, one of which worked as a city worker, collecting dog poo from bins at local parks and what not. One day, an Occult missionary walks through the park. She looks different then the others, she doesn't wear luxurious Tom Ford suits or formal shoes, she wore a white sundress, with brown flowing hair, golden butterfly pins holding up an intricate hairstyle, and walking a Bichon Frise. Elegant in nature, beautiful in appearance, way above the leagues of a city worker collecting dog poo. She walks up to a dog bin, while the Epileptic is changing out the bins, and patiently waits for him to finish, before chucking a bag of dog poop inside. She immediately strikes up a conversation with the epileptic, and they surprisingly share a lot in common. His love for anime, his love for books and elaborate stories. The Missionary relates to all of it. They get to know eachother quite well. The Missionary has to go to the supermarket to get some groceries, and she actually asks the Epileptic to come with. Despite him being on work, the epileptic believes that this could be his chance to meet someone perfect, and the supermarket was quite close by. The epileptic decides to follow, following the Missionary into the supermarket, her dog gets tied up outside, as she gets some items, a few vegetables. While he is distracted, she pulls out her phone and shows the epileptic a video of intense bright flashing lights and static being played loudly. The epileptic falls to the ground in a seizure, the Missionary turns off her phone and begins to scream panicked, shouting for help. At the same time, the single mother, who is quite empathetic, and is a nurse, immediately rushes to assist, telling her five-year-old to keep an eye on the groceries. As a crowd surrounds the epileptic having a seizure, a Missionary in a Black Hoodie takes the five-year-old, simply picking him up and guiding him out of the store, and straight into a White Calais in a blind-spot of the parking lot cameras, with two Missionaries and the boy inside, the Calais drives off, and the missionary in the hoodie quickly walks away. The Missionary in the dress stays with the epileptic, pretending that he just fell for no reason. The two missionaries drive into an incredibly wealthy part of the state, one with neighbourhood mansions and such. One of these mansions, contains not only an Organization Executive, but also the father of the child previously kidnapped from the Organization, the one in the tank. The Calais drives into a nearby forest and parks. They treat the five-year-old quite well, giving him some sweets, and playing car games with him. At the end, they let him into the forest and hand him a letter. The letter with the locker key. They tell the boy to keep walking in a certain direction and hand the letter to a man in a suit that is standing at a nearby gate and not to worry, they will follow behind after conducting some business. The boy agrees and begins to walk, the Missionaries simply enter their vehicle and leave the boy. An Organization guard, wearing his Saint Laurent Black suit, and an MP7, notices the child emerge from the forest. Confused, he approaches the child and asks what he is doing out here. The child hands him the letter. He opens it, and reads the contents, immediately bringing the child inside and showing the letter to Organization Command. The Occult, using their backdoor into NJDOT, begin to broadcast the traffic cameras around the I-78 Express and the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge Toll Gate to Pilgrimage. It asks it's viewers, whether the Organization can show courage and bravery? To save an innocent life. Place your bets now. Millions of dollars in Bitcoin begins to flood in, as the extravagant violent debut post of Pilgrimage attracts more disturbed yet wealthy interested individuals.",1,1751069036.0,Dumpforstuff,0,1.0,False

1lm92cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lm92cu/marrying_my_savior_after_my_boyfriend_abandoned_me/,Marrying My Savior After My Boyfriend Abandoned Me:,"Diagnosed with brain cancer, Aurora turns to her secret boyfriend of ten years—renowned surgeon Karson Crawford—for help. But his icy rejection shatters her: 'Not even you.' Abandoned and desperate, she accepts a sudden marriage proposal from Julian Moore, who secures her treatment. As Aurora starts anew, Karson’s dismissive assistant demands her return with a cold command. But when Karson finally reaches out, is it too late—or does he have a secret of his own?

# Chapter 1 - A Lifeline in the Storm

I was diagnosed with brain cancer and needed to secure an appointment with a specialist.

Summoning all my courage, I went to seek help from my secret boyfriend of ten years—a renowned surgeon.

But before I could even finish speaking, Karson Crawford coldly cut me off:

""I've told you before—don’t try to exploit my position for favors, not for yourself or your family.""

""Not even you.""

His efficient assistant, Yareli Black, promptly ushered me out of his office.

I tried every possible way to explain, but he blocked me and avoided me completely.

Until the appointment window closed.

Then Karson called to ask, ""What do you want for our anniversary?""

I let out a bitter laugh. ""To break up with you and never see you again.""

\------

I ended things with Karson right in front of Julian Moore.

The next second, Julian whisked me to the courthouse, married me on the spot, and used our marriage certificate to secure me an appointment at the city hospital.

""Focus on getting better. Don’t worry about the costs—I’ve got you covered.""

My chest tightened, warmth flooding through me, my voice trembling.

""Thank you.""

Julian was silent for a long moment before speaking solemnly as we reached my doorstep:

""Aurora, you don’t have to thank me. I’ve waited ten years for you. This was my choice.""

Years of Karson’s indifference had already eroded all my expectations.

Julian’s words and actions now were like a lifeline in the storm.

I reached out and hugged him, his cheeks flushing pink, before turning to go inside.

The apartment was still filled with traces of Karson and me.

He had been avoiding me for a full month.

At first, I left my medical report in plain sight on the coffee table, hoping he’d notice.

Later, I posted a plea for help on Facebook, hoping he’d see it.

But he was too busy. Too rigid.

Even as his girlfriend, I wasn’t granted the slightest privilege.

So when I swallowed my pride, begged him, and still got nothing—not even pity—I decided to stop loving him.

I would marry Julian, who had loved me silently for years, if it meant a chance to live.

Outside, rain pattered against the window. Then the walkie-talkie on the table crackled to life.

Yareli’s voice came through, sharp and demanding.

""Aurora, Karson and I just finished surgery. The cafeteria’s closed. Make us a roast chicken with mashed potatoes and a garden salad—now. And hurry. We’re starving.""

Yareli was the only one in the entire hospital who knew about Karson and me.

She had always spoken to me like this—commands, no courtesy.

It made me deeply uncomfortable, and I complained to Karson.

He just brushed it off.

""Yareli’s used to giving orders in the OR. She doesn’t mean anything by it. You’ll get used to it.""

I fell silent.

Just like when he, as my boyfriend, had forbidden me from texting him—only walkie-talkies allowed.

I had protested.

He dismissed my frustration with irritation.

""This is more efficient. Texts are distracting.""

I loved Karson. I knew he was a brilliant surgeon, always busy. I tried to be understanding.

But later, when I told him how much it hurt that Yareli was always between us—even making me bring her dinner too—his response was dismissive.

""It’s just an extra plate. Why are you making a big deal out of it?""

Every time I forgave, he took me for granted a little more.

# Chapter 2 - The Breaking Point

My chest still ached, and my eyes stung with unshed tears.

Yes, it would have been such a simple favor.

So why couldn’t he help me get a family appointment slot? Why did he just stand by and watch me suffer?

I wiped the corner of my eye and flatly refused Yareli:

""Sorry, it's too late. I'm going to bed. Order your own pizza.""

A faint, mocking voice crackled through the intercom.

""Aurora, Dr. Crawford isn’t here right now. Throwing a fit won’t do you any good.""

A wave of exhaustion crashed over me.

Yareli’s words confirmed one thing—Karson knew I’d been trying to reach him all this time. He knew I’d made up my mind to end things.

And yet, he didn’t care.

He even assumed I was just being petty, still expecting me to bring him coffee like it was nothing.

I didn’t argue. Instead, I slammed the intercom onto the floor, shattering it to pieces.

Karson came home at three in the morning.

The moment he stepped inside, he found me still packing my things.

Gone was the pristine white coat—he wore a casual hoodie instead, looking nothing like a brilliant surgeon pushing thirty.

That boyish charm, that effortless contrast—

Once upon a time, it had completely captivated me.

I stood up, about to speak, when Yareli slipped out from behind him, her voice sickly sweet.

""Karson, I’m exhausted. Let’s just go to bed already\~""

Silence hung heavy between us.

The three of us stood frozen, locked in an unspoken standoff.

Finally, Karson broke the quiet, his voice edged with irritation.

""Aurora, how long are you going to keep this up? Packing your bags in the middle of the night—are you seriously running away now?""

I took a deep breath and forced a smile.

""Just finishing up. I’ll sleep in the guest room tonight and leave in the morning.""

I turned toward the guest room, but Karson grabbed my wrist, his grip tight.

""Yareli’s place is being renovated. That’s the only reason I brought her here. We’re just colleagues. Don’t read into it.""

My eyes burned.

I really wanted to hold it in—after all, we were almost done. I could’ve pretended not to see anything.

But after years of swallowing my pain, I just couldn’t take it anymore.

I turned back, my voice sharp.

""So when she hugged you around the waist and nuzzled into your neck, that’s just colleague behavior, is it?""

A flicker of panic crossed Karson’s eyes.

Yareli stepped forward, cheeks flushed, playing the tipsy card.

""Sorry, I had a little too much wine. Must’ve looked ridiculous.""

""Aurora, Karson and I really are just coworkers. Stop being so jealous. We just pulled four surgeries back-to-back—we’re dead on our feet. Cut him some slack, okay?""

Yareli was infamous at the hospital for her silver tongue. Pretty, adaptable, the go-to mediator for patient disputes.

With just a few words, she’d spun their inappropriate behavior into nothing, then pinned the blame on me.

Gritting my teeth against the bitterness rising in my throat, I opened my mouth to fire back—

# Chapter 3 - Defiance and the Breaking Point

""Aurora, apologize.""""You're embarrassing me in front of our guest. I've spoiled you too much—your attitude is getting out of hand!""His words hit me like hammer strikes, each one sharp and deliberate.

1lm9087,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dumpforstuff/comments/1lm9087/address_8745_cresent_drive_hollywood_hills_west/,"Address 8745, Cresent Drive, Hollywood Hills West, Los Angeles, California /// Exterior","The house is four stories and is cantilevered. It's made of Pietra Grey Marble, reinforced Concrete for support, and Thassos White Marble with a lot of high end floor-to-ceiling UL 752 Level 10 Electrochromic Glass windows. The house is made of Reinforced Concrete however, it's mostly covered by the Marble. The house has a white-bricked furnace shaped mailbox that has a Titanium interior and a physical lock similar to the front door to avoid tampering. The mailbox is along both a concrete slab path, and a gently sloped curved driveway into a garage. The path leads to the front door, with another small concrete path leading into the driveway. The house has Arecaceae Palm Trees along the front north-end of the house. In the front garden, there is an indoor water feature, that creates a waterfall that goes into an outdoor water feature, which uses Pietra Grey Marble to create such intricate design. Along the driveway are concrete half walls with Recessed wall lights that follow the driveway all the way up until the path that connects the slab and driveway together. There is a Weathered Grey Teak canopy that protects the garage doors. In the drive way, there is a Blue Bugatti Chiron, White Pagani Huayra, Black Koenigsegg Jesko, Brown and Yellow Rolls-Royce Phantom, Black Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, and Red Aston Martin Valkyrie, all with such luxurious and performance-enhancing modifications that it shall not be mentioned as we are focusing on the house. There are two Custom Carriage-Style Garage Door that lead into the garage, there is also a guard who is standing to the right of the garage doors. The garage doors also have titanium-reinforcement within it. The guards themselves wear Brion Black Suits with Kevlar Vests with Level III Ballistic Plates underneath, Black Oxford Shoes, they have ear pieces and radios connected to a leather utility belt, Galco Underarm Holster containing a Glock 17 Gen5 with two 17-round magazines, and two twenty-round Heckler & Kock MP7 magazines, which of course also leads to their possession of the Heckler & Kock MP7, some guards have other weapons like Colt M4A1s, FN SCAR-Ls, and M14 EBRs, most notably the CATs and balcony and roof guards have the more powerful weapons, that we will get into detail later. On the West side of the house, there is a hedge wall, along that hedge wall is another concrete slab path that leads to the west-side balcony 5-a-side football pitch that will be put in more detail later on. Now, let's go back to the front door. The Front Door has Floor-to-Ceiling windows that go up two stories, the door itself has a very extensive lock system, particularly, an August Smart Lock Pro, BioKey Biometric Scanner, Wireless Receiver, Mul-T-Lock Physical Lock, as well as a Heavy-duty bolt controlled electronically and manually. The Lock housing is made of titanium alloy with ceramic composite armor, and the system has Multi-factor Biometric Authentication with ultra-high resolution and live tissue detection fingerprint and Iris scanning. The key itself is Custom-designed, laser-cut metal key with embedded RFID chip for dual verification, and there is also a guard with an MP7 stationed right next to the door, which is also protected by another Weathered Grey Teak canopy that protects the front door from weather. Not to mention the amount of cameras with both infra-red and night-vision that is strategically placed around the house, with motion-detectors in the front garden, sides of the house, and hedge walls. Before we enter the house, let's go along the west-side path and into the five-a-side football pitch. The pitch uses 4G Astro Turf surrounded by a green welded mesh fence and surrounded by four floodlights, two on each side as well as a small plastic sports cabinet with size 5 Footballs, cones and dummies. The football pitch was originally a Tennis Court, but the owner's wife didn't use it often and his son wanted a place to go train by himself after his football training. There is also an elevator nearby to the football pitch that leads right in the house, and that elevator is guarded by another guard with an MP7. Now what's interesting is that the football pitch is cantilevered, which means it's connected to a balcony. To the left of the football pitch is a Statuario Marble staircase that leads up onto the south-side balcony. Between the green fencing of the football pitch is a Limestone wall with a bunch of vines with roses growing on it, a very beautiful and elegant part of the mansion that the wife sometimes inhabits. Going up the stairs, you arrive at the south-side main balcony which is made of Statuario Marble. There is an exposed Wooden Firepit, with three Full-Grain Italian Black Leather couches with metal steel frames and steel-glass side table underneath a Quarter Sawn White Oak canopy that can be covered by more vegetation. The Balcony Guardrail is a frameless glass balustrade that goes around the entire balcony, the part of the balcony that overlooks the football pitch is covered by a Carrara Marble half-wall topped by hedges. The south-side balcony leads to both an entranceway, which is just glass-sliding ceiling-to-floor doors, but also leads towards a balcony that has a linear built-in fireplace within a Pietra Grey Marble wall, and towards another entranceway that leads into the mansion. This entranceway is guarded by a guard with an M4A1 who is ordered to constantly patrol this part of the south-side balcony. Going back to the main part of the south-side balcony, there is another staircase that goes down towards the mansion onto the lower south-side balcony section, with sections made of White Ash, there is a small section of the balcony that goes along the staircase, on this section is another guard with an M4A1 who patrols the lower south-side balcony section. Now what's unique about the lower south-side balcony section, is that it has a view of the Los Angeles skyline courtesy south, but behind this view, is the lower part of the glass-walled Infinity pool that is quite deep, it's actually on the south-side balcony section, but it extends down to the lower south-side balcony section. The lower south-side balcony section is between the frameless glass balustrade that prevents someone from falling and the glass walled Infinity pool that is used as a wall, with recessed floor lighting along the edges of the foundation of the glass walled Infinity pool to illuminate the pool. The lower south-side balcony section leads to the east-side balcony section. The East-side section contains quite a cosy little place. There is a small hangout, with three orange beanbags and another exposed Wooden Firepit within an three-sided walled open air room, between the glass-walled infinity pool and the house itself, with glass sliding doors that lead inside. Unfortunately, the cosiness of this open air room is broken by the presence of two guards that take positions along the pillars that hold up the open air room. There is an open entranceway through one of the walls that lead into another part of the east-side balcony section, past some Boxwood trees, and a Carrara Marble half-wall with floor-to-ceiling balusters that goes up some stairs, and into the north balcony section. There are also more Arecaceae Palm Trees along this side of the house. A Statuario Marble Slat Bridge goes across the water feature and into the north balcony section. I would like to go into more detail around the water feature, it's actually quite big. It's quite deep, from the second floor balcony all the way down to the first floor, it's got a lot of expensive fish as well as an eco system. It's basically a large fish tank with substrate, decorations and hiding places like sunken ships, Atlantis Castles, and caves. It's quite interesting. The waterfall itself acts as an Aeration system which ensures gas exchange. The water feature itself has heaters built into the walls and a a filtration system, as the fish are warm-water. It's also lit by recessed floor lighting along the sides of the feature. What's cool is that the water feature in the front garden is also similar to the water feature on the second floor balcony... It's a fish tank as well, but for cold water fish. It's got all the same eco systems, substrate, decorations, and life support systems with really expensive fish, just in the front garden. Very nice use of transition. Across the slat bridge, leads into a Pietra Grey Marble floored north balcony section, with three white sun beds, a glass-steel coffee table, and a small plant bed with hedges on here, which is slightly covered by a Weathered Grey Teak canopy. It's a very quiet part of the mansion, but there is a guard with an M4A1 here. One of the guards from the positions in the east-side balcony also occasionally goes up here to patrol and check in on said guard.",1,1751068711.0,Dumpforstuff,0,1.0,False

I'm 18, and I work full time as an apprentice construction plumber.

I've had some pretty extreme expenses in the last 3ish months. My family moved (tons of gas on my part). I've gone through 2 vehicles (one impounded because of how unsafe it was, and the other's motor siezed a week after I got it), and my current car has nearly got fire twice (brakes seized and overheated on the highway, I fixed this now, but the tow is very expensive).

I need to chip in 1000/month for rent, and my car insurance is 250/month (absolute minimum legal coverage, no accidents).

I make 20 an hour before tax, but my work often ends early and/or I get shorted hours, so my paycheques only amount to be roughly 1100-1200 dollars (CAD)

My jobsites are all across town, between 30-60km drives each way. Lots of gas. And I pretty often have to drive between different sites during the day, more gas especially if I get sent into the city (I live in a rural area about 60km outside of Vancouver)



My foreman told me today, that I have about a week to find more tools or I will no longer be employed. But I can't afford new tools. I can't even afford new steel toes (my boots are literally falling apart, my big toe is sticking out the sides and the treads are falling off). I can barely afford the gas to get to work anyway. The main tools I'm being pressed to buy is an angle grinder and a worsbro gun, but I'm also supposed to find more general hand tools.

I have one single pair of pants that isn't completely destroyed, and I need to buy more of those.

I got paid this morning, but I also paid my rent this morning, so at the end of today I only have $150 to my name, and that's supposed to get me through the next 2 weeks.


I've fished out everything I've saved over the last year or so on this major move, and my vehicles (which I never really got much of a choice to buy). Several thousand dollars just to keep up. Now I am pretty well guaranteed to loose my job.

I have no energy for anything anymore, I'm up at 3:30 in the morning to leave before 5, and I'm home around 6 on some days. Even after the entire pot of coffee, I still end up nodding off behind the wheel to work. I don't have the money to buy lunch, and there isn't much around the house to pack either. I gave myself a concussion not too long ago and had to take 2 days off of work because of that as well.

1. Leadership Award Controversy: Why did State Administrative Bishop Anthony Pelt receive the Excellence in Leadership Award from Assistant Presiding Bishop Tony Stewart the night after Bishop, Pastor, Prophet, and Necromancer Todd Hall was abruptly canceled as the Friday night speaker by the Executive Committee of the Church of God - Cleveland, TN? 

2. Campground Conundrum: Why is the Church of God State Campground and RV Park in Leesburg, Florida, overflowing with motel guests and RVs despite the grounds and facilities being in disrepair? 

3. Headquarters Location: Where is the State Headquarters Office actually located? 

4. HRS Office Mystery: Why is an HRS office situated on the state campground site? 

5. Management Questions: Who is currently managing the campground and RV park? 

6. Financial Puzzle: After 32 years and numerous fundraising efforts, why hasn’t the campground been paid off? Pastor Robert will delve into these pressing issues, offering insightful analysis and inviting listeners to ponder the answers.

1lm8pfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1lm8pfs/gaining_lean_muscle_issue/,Gaining lean muscle issue,"Hey guys,

I hope your gains and pr’s are going great this year for all. 

I have a question and I feel like if I could do a lot of extensive research, I will eventually find an answer. However I ask because for a while I’ve been struggling to gain lean muscle in the lean bulk way. Now I am sure I have to bulk up than the lean bulk protocol. My goal is to bulk up and then shred for definition. Here’s a breakdown of what I can share

I’m 26 and weigh around ~140-145lbs. My height is 5’6. The last time I weighed was around 1 month ago. I do have a pretty high active job as a manager in a fast casual restaurant. I average 10k steps or more a day (no I don’t get tired somehow unless I work 12-13hr shifts which I haven’t done since 6 months ago.)

I do intermittent fasting throughout the day, so no breakfast or anything until 1:30. I end that fasting window around 8:30-9:30 and roll over the next day. I do also drink black coffee as my “stimulant to get by the morning and a trigger to use the bathroom.” 

I eat around 2900cals during the days I workout and 2500cals throughout the days I’m not at the gym to not gain excess weight I shouldn’t. My macro split is about 370g of carbs, 100g of fats, and 150g of protein. I do not track anything else except those 3 with calories as well as I try to get as accurate as I can. 

On my off days I do a bit of 30min walk as I can and a few exercises that are not targeted in a 3 day splits such as forearms and neck. 

I’m not sure what I can do. Honestly I’m kinda nervous to bulk up to a certain point and regret doing it as I have faced body dysmorphia and went back to cutting. If you have any suggestions on this I will be glad to take the advice needed. Thanks!",0,1751067854.0,bodyweightfitness,1,0.5,False

I fly Jet Blue regularly to fly home to New England about twice a month. For the longest time I never had bad experiences with JB but recently that has not been the case. 

Over the past few times I’ve experienced delayed on JB that I think can be generally described as unacceptable. Including last week when I waited over 4 hours for an evening flight delay. Once on the ground in Providence my Uber was almost $100 because it was so late at night.

Today was probably my final straw. On an evening flight to Providence JB began the boarding process. The gate attendant mentioned multiple times over the speaker that our flight was going to depart on time and we should try to have a speedy boarding process to ensure that happens. About 5 minutes into boarding they stop calling groups, get on the speakers and announce that there is a faulty coffee maker that must be repaired before take off.

WHAT?!

Multiple people beg the gate attendant that we do not need a coffee maker for a 2.5 hour evening flight and just to remove the coffee maker from the plane and get us into the air. We have now been sitting at the gate about an hour longer than our scheduled flight time due to a leaky coffee maker.

Frankly, this is unacceptable.

I hate to say this, but I have never had such issues with Spirit or Frontier airlines, going forward I will be booking with those airlines as they are cheaper and seem to regard their customers’ time in higher regard. 

Edit: Spelling

Edit: Thanks for the info everyone, I was frustrated by two bad experiences in a row. Providence airport is not an easy airport to get in and out of especially later at night. Hence my frustration. I still find it awkward how frequently they have had issues lately. I had no idea FAA regulations were as specific as coffee makers or snack carts.",2,1751067712.0,jetblue,13,0.56,False

1lm8j3a,https://i.redd.it/x2kecxp82k9f1.png,Late endgame Major spoiler,"
 If anyone who's digging deeper in rabbit holes searching for some connection about the Spirals and Inneclipse event, I might have something that's interesting.
 

 I started in the Ballroom because of the mention of the Inneclipse Ball 1952 on the picture. Then the music sheets read:
 -Page 6 says,
""Under the stars the dance is held."" 
 -Page 7 says,
 ""Two remain for one last dance"". I thought about,  this must be why you reset to 2 ""GEMS"" when you enter the Ballroom. 
 2 gems are part of a dance under the stars. I ended up thinking of constellations and two diamonds that give you gems. 
  
   Diamondus Major and Diamondus Minor
 
 Simon and Clara are represented as Diamondus Major and Diamondus Minor. They are the ""stars""/""gems"" of the ""dance.""
   Another clue that made me spiral toward this theory was the Star Chart in the Planetarium said that Diamondus Major and Minor were seen together for the first time at ""29 stars"". Sounded very specific.
   The only way to view or select the constellations you want is with a Large Telescope and a Mini Telescope. 
   If 2 remain for a second chance that means there are 2 parts to the dance.

1. All the Dancers are at the ball
(All constellations are chosen in Observatory)
2. Only Simon and Clara remain after twelve
(Only Diamondus Major + Minor are chosen)
     That's why we need to view the constellations ""twice"". One telescope for the first part of the dance and a second telescope for the 2 remaining dancers/stars. 
  
Ok, so all the notes with anagrams of 
Does it Never End? and the Spiral of Stars, 
is for a ""dance"" we have to perform for 
the Inneclipse.
  
- denoted in verse
  In the Music Room you get 
     1 Major key and 1 Minor key.
     D. Major and D. Minor. Music keys.
     Diamondus Major and Diamondus Minor.
  Notice there's 2 tiny thorns on the note with the Clef symbol and ""thorns are ""twice"" as  SHARP  # towards the conclusion.

- does it never end? 
   This is implying that the Planets and Stars are involved. We see this on the historical map in the Classroom. 
    i think the word STARS, written in BLUE at the end of the Spiral, is missing a letter.  Which is ""i"" for  STAIRS. Like the the one you see on rank 2, tile 2 from the picture puzzle. There is a Diamondus Minor displayed for STARS and a spiral of stairs from the Library for STAIRS, which also the Library has Tended Rose Vine?  anagram note.
   The Spiral of Stars is also the Spiral of Stairs. Some examples of spiral stairs are the Tomb which connects to the Torch Chamber and the Fountain. The Fountain was the most interesting one because you can see black markings on the top and looks like the Planet's positions from the Historical Map in the Classroom. There's also one black marking on the pattern on the ground. This may be the sixth planet? Does that indicate that the spiral doesn't end yet?
  The list i have of Spiral of Stairs are,
1. The Fountain (planets)
2. The Library (Tended Rose Vine?)
3. The Observatory (use 2 Telescopes)
4. The Torch Room(connect-tomb,fountain)
5. The Tomb (angels/connect-torch,fountain)
6. The Clock Tower (cardinal dir./clock hands)
Thr Clock Tower also has the Rogue Moon visible above room 46. 
   But i think it's the Fountain. Why? Because the next note says,

-investor needed.
 What's an investor? 
   ""A person who puts money into something in order to make a profit or get an advantage.""
  We can make a wish buy tossing a coin in the Fountain once a day. This is used to bank your coin like the Chapel.  I believe 50 coins is the maximum for the Fountain. As i recall, 50 stars is when you see the Ink Well appear to help remove stars, if you need to reset back to 29 stars. Maybe you need to have 29 coins and then remove 27 so 2 remain. 

-TENDED ROSE VINE? 
Or under the magnifying glass, it reads
    Tended Rose Vine? The other letters are lower case. Not sure why.
     Lady Auravei said that ""thorns are twice  as SHARP""(D. Major sharp and D. Minor sharp) at conclusion of our journey."" Perhaps it means the conclusion of the 100 words of the Spiral of Stars ending with the blue word STARS. Also the two thorns on the Clef could be Simon and Clara near the end of the dance. ""The conclusion of the journey""
  And also the Library stairs was used for the picture puzzle Eight Gates which is associated with the anagram note Tended Rose Vine.
 Roses are also seen on the Mora Jai boxes.
 Something that might not be relevant is the doctor's last name for Mary's birth certificate is Rose. Lilly Rysian Rose. 
  Interesting fact: 
   Blue roses are often used to symbolize mystery or the unattainable.
  
   Going back to the Planetarium, the Star Chart about Diamondus Major and Diamondus Minor seen together in the sky at the same time for the first time. (29 stars).
Then later again with seven constellations in the sky (40) but also at (38) and (48).
   
  Fun equation : 
      46+46=92
      92 flipped is 29 stars 
 
   The shape for inversion is  
      ◇  = Diamondus Minor. 
  And i remember someone mentioned the anagram ""d-noted inverse"". In music, inversion refers to the 
    ""rearranging the notes of an interval, chord or melody.""
   In astrology, inversion can be used to describe different meanings like an ""Ecliptic inversion, planet retrogrades, or opposite signs like Taurus and Scorpio.""
  In dance, ""an inversion refers to a move where the dancer's body is positioned with the feet higher than the head.""
  I guess there's all kinds of flipping and spinning in dancing. The Blessing of the Dancer from the Shrine costs a ""gem"" and ""spins"" floorplans. You can spin the Observatory to face the North sky. There's 4 ways to spin or rotate: the Dancer, Rotunda, Dovecote and the Ornate Compass.
  Speaking of the Compass, on the Classroom Historical Map there's an astrologer holding a parchment paper on the astrology section, it shows Diamondus Minor, the Devoted Moon and Rogue Moon, and Dauja planet.
Dauja is also seen in the Blue Prince Manuscript beside a princess holding an uncaged, four-winged black bird.
  Dauja is also found on the Planetarium and Observatory floorplan in a 2D fashion and on the word Telescope when looking at it in the Blueprint Menu replacing the letter ""o"".

Ok now here's something interesting. We have 2 diamonds, from the Ballroom. Both Diamondus Major and Diamondus Minor.
  There's all kinds gems and a Blue Tent Memo in the Ballroom says that ""MAJORity of gems found in the house are artificially produced."" The Gardener had artificially produced the majority of them.
 The MINORity of gems could be the rare ones like rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. We have an Emerald Bracelet, The Crown of the Blueprints, and Rubies from previous Ruby Crown scattered around the estate. I counted how many gems there are in total.

8 sapphires + 7 rubies + 12 emeralds
 + 2 diamonds = 29

29 gems
29 stars to see Diamondus Major and Minor for the first time through the Telescope.

Now I know what you're thinking, 7 rubies? 
We only found 6. Drafting Room had no ruby. 
   Well I have theory about that. 
The Emerald Bracelet is shown being worn by Lady Auravei in the Attic along with the Moon Pendant. Look very close at the Moon Pendant. I think it's also Fennmora, The Red Stone. This might have something to do in the Planetarium with Fennmora being in front of the moon.
  The Emerald Bracelet is showing 10 emeralds in the Showroom, but in the Blueprint Menu it shows 12 and
 Blue = True.
  So basically the Gems and the Stars are part of the dance ceremony. If ""two remain for one last dance."" Means only 2 diamonds left, then that means we must somehow remove the items from our inventory. We cannot sell the Crown at the Trading Post. But it we can lose it at the Lost and Found room which coincidentally happens to have the anagram note ""Investor Needed.""

 If you go in the Pump Room and drain the Fountain, you can see half of it is darker. The Kitchen and Greenhouse also are darker. This might mean that the water can be interacted with, where the Reservoir, Pool and Aqaurium only reveals what's hidden. The Greenhouse only affects gem growth as far as I know but it could be a type of interactive thing. The Fountain you can ""interact"" by tossing a coin and ""reveal"" them later. Or reveal something hidden.
 

""The clock strikes twelve""
""Only time will tell""
    I think this refers to those clocks you can find in the Den (2clocks, 2dancers), Sauna(?), and Weight Room(Eight Room or wait room). They must have something to do with waiting or being lazy, sloth.
  They all have ""clock hands"" pointing in between 11 to 1. Which the music said that ""at the end, clock strikes twelve"" so maybe from 11 to 12 the ""dance begins"". Or 11:55 to 12. Because an eclipse usually last around 5 or 10 minutes. But ""around clock hands"" can also mean 1 hour. 
 So that means after 12,
   ""two remain for one last dance. Spin again around clock hands.""
 ""Turn again a second chance."" 
From 12 to 1, or 12 to 12:05 is when the second part of the dance.
  I did notice that the Telescope in the Observatory floorplan is pointing 
northeast-ish and the Clock Tower floorplan has cardinal directions pointing 
northeast-ish like the Key of Aries puzzle. These rooms are also part of the Spiral of Stairs.
  I'm not really convinced that the Sacred Hour is the clock hands the music notes are referring to but Sacred Hour may be something to do with after 12 like wait until 130
  Midnight makes sense, but it don't think i saw anywhere saying midnight. Only,
   ""the gems(stars, etc.)that shine in night and rain"" could mean midnight, from the page 5 music sheets in the Greenhouse.
 Or ""The gems(D.major+D.Minor,Simon+Clara) that shine in night and rain. (Orinda Aries and Eraja, black and violet)

  So here's what we do maybe.
 the dance begins at 11 or 11:55 and ends at 12. So we go to the Observatory and view all the stars in the Mini Telescope facing North, while carrying the Emerald Bracelet, The Moon Pendant, and the Crown of the Blueprints, and might have to pick up the Rubies unless having the red envelopes counts as having them on you. Then we ""dance""  in the Lost and Found room to remove the Bracelet, Pendant and Crown(only way to remove the crown), except the Mini Telescope (unless you use it first instead) then look at the stars again but only select the Diamondus Major and Minor. Two remain after you get rid of the other items. Or enter the Ballroom also and get the 2 gems if we had zero. And at some point we toss a coin in the Fountain to make a wish or we need put one in everyday to add 29. Then drain, and take away 27 so 2 remain. 
  I think the page 5 green music sheets referring to ""gems and coins toss away""  are losing the items in the Lost and Found and tossing a coin or coins in the fountain. Maybe start with zero before the dance starts.
  
   Another thing is the rooms in the Atelier Blue path rooms have the Observatory, Library, Music Room, and Ballroom. The Pantry only makes me think of "" a letter is missing"" could be for Spiral of Stars/Stairs or the coffee missing an E. The Spare Room has many upgrades. Her Ladyship's Spare Room which can spawn a Telescope and Foyer because of the suspicious hands. Also, the inversion color of Blue, is Orange. 
   Gallery has the words
EMPTY ONESELF MOTHER SWANSONG. 
Empty oneself makes me think of losing the Bracelet,  Crown,  and Moon Pendant.

 There is also the SACRED note in the Clock Tower talks about north is Rogue Moon and the weather vane  points north, reveals the Rogue Moon. This might relevant for the dance.

He decided to check into a weeklong detox and go straight to a 30 day inpatient rehab. I’m glad he’s there. I don’t know what our future would be between he and I but we do have a one-year-old that misses his father terribly. Besides the fact that my partner did not think about our son when he decided to drink and relapse, he is a really good dad. And he called me today on an unknown number. That’s the only reason why I picked up and he mentioned after our conversation that he’s allowed to have visitors on Sundays and he asked if we could come and visit him for a while.  I personally don’t need to see him at all, but my son has been asking about him constantly and I’m just wondering if we should go and visit him for a while. It could be that I drop him off with his dad and he hangs out there for an hour or so while I go get a coffee and run a couple errands because I really have nothing to say to him, but at least he could see his dad. Has anyone else been through this? I kind of wanna leave our son with him for a bit so that I don’t get love bombed or manipulated in someway, which makes me think about things that I don’t want to think about.

Some people here are probably coming to the USA this fall, and I wanted to share some of my experiences living here with you guys to carry with you while coming here. Details I share in this post are from my perspective and can be different for you. Let's dive in:

0. Talk to yourself - go to some cafe, get a coffee and a notebook, write down what makes you want to come to the USA, is it developing skills? Getting a job after you graduate? Experience the US for 2 years and come back? What do you want to do with your life? You won't have the support system that your family and friends have always provided you with in India. You are really on your own until you make meaningful friendships. Get yourself to a point mentally where you have a clear plan of what your next two years should look like, so you don't regret the way you spent your time here.

1. Roommates - most people here share rooms with people that they find through WhatsApp/other groups and decide to stay together based on very little information about each other, and face issues once they're 6 months into their program. I understand that looking for roommates this way is a gamble, and most people have to go through it. Before you decide to commit to roommates, get to know each other, see if you guys have a possibility of becoming friends, before looking for a home. Roommates are going to be a part of your inner circle as soon as you land here. Try to have people around you who are supportive of you and trustworthy. I have seen people get stuck with uncooperative and rude roommates for a year, and that can have a significant impact on your mental health! Use your limited judgment to guide you in selecting good roommates.

2. Friends - Try to be outgoing and initiate friendships in your first semester. US citizens in some cities can have a slightly different outlook towards Indians and might want to stay away. In that case, look for fellow Indians around your campus and go talk to them, say hi! They're as nervous and confused as you are in your early life here

3. Work - Get involved in as manny things as you can in the 2 years of your MS program, find something that you like (ideally in the first semester) and work your ass off to be better than anyone else in your work. If you don't grind, it'll be even more difficult for you to look for jobs once you graduate because you don't have anything to help you stand out from the crowd.

This post might sound a little disheartening, but I have had the best time of my life in my degree, hope you guys love it here too! My DMs are always open if you guys have specific questions I can help with!",1,1751067044.0,Indians_StudyAbroad,2,1.0,False

1lm8ecx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tourettes/comments/1lm8ecx/heres_some_hope_and_something_to_try/,"Here's some hope, and something to try","Hi all

If you don't want to read this cut to the bottom and I'll save you the story

Some background for context I am a long term tic disorder sufferer since it developed in my early 20s. The features of my disorder are not particularly relevant but for context i was frustrated with the frequency and the consistency of my tics rather than the intensity. They are obvious but not in a completely socially alienating way (luckily I am very outgoing and lean into them a bit. I've tried many treatments none of which worked except one:

I've tried:

- Talking therapy
- Antagonist Motor Therapy
- CBIT
- Medication (briefly)
- Meditation 
- Quitting alcohol
- Fixing my sleep
- Reducing stress
- Socializing more, getting more sun
- Acceptance

But I'll be really honest most of it had a negligible if only temporary effect. My YGTSS score was still north of 30 fairly constantly and fixating on it sometimes would even worsen it.

However I have quit caffeine and man...my YGTSS score is is probably 12-15...if that and has been consistently so for about 10 months.

Honestly I wish someone reassured me before when I made quitting caffeine one of my strategies.

You may get stuck where I was but I think you should consider it. I was only drinking one single coffee per day once I wheaned it down. The withdrawal symptoms of the caffeine would always make my tics much worse for about three weeks and I'd quit, thinking that the caffeine somehow helped me. The way I rationalized it was that ritolin stimulants help those with ADHD so maybe there was a place for stimulants in the dysregulative neuropsych of tic disorder (but I proved myself wrong).

Once the withdrawal symptoms slowly wore off I have never felt so happy I made that change. My symptoms are so manageable now that I barely think about the tics. 

One win for me is that for the first time since being a teenager someone acknowledged the tic with ""Your eye is going nuts"". Which may sound rude but as many of you know if your tics are bad enough you won't be approachable in a way someone would be comfortable mentioning it. I know when people talk about it, it means they have reduced because I don't appear like I'm suffering or would be offended by it being mentioned.

Caffeine, trust me try and quit it.

Avery returned from his run with sea wind in his hair and ache in his bones, but his heart was light. His rucksack swung heavier than usual, packed with small treasures: 

A fresh sketch journal for Owen, bound in worn leather. 

A hairpin for Lysanthe—silver filigree studded with sea-glint emeralds, Avery saved up for over weeks. 

And for Rory—a delicate box of paints, colors spun from crushed shell and impossible shimmer. The merchant had said they’d sing when they touched the page. 

Avery couldn’t wait to see her face. Not because he expected anything—just because she was part of them now. He saw how Owen looked at her. How Lysanthe eased around her. And it felt right. 

He knocked at the manor gate. 

Sebastian answered, eyes gleaming with thinly veiled distaste. 

“What could you possibly want?” Sebastian asked staring down his nose 

Avery lifted a brow. “I’m here to see Rory. Not that it’s any of your business.” 

 	“Anything pertaining to House Thorne is entirely my business,” Sebastian replied coldly.  “Miss Rory is not here. Nor do I know when she will return. The Baron is also indisposed at the moment.” 

Avery blinked. “What—? Where is she?” 

“That isn’t your concern.” 

He shifted, suddenly uncomfortable. “Alright, I just—brought her something. Brought things for—” 

 	“Clutter,” Sebastian clipped. 

Avery frowned. “Excuse me?” 

“Clutter,” Sebastian repeated—flatter now, dryer.  “That’s all you bring. Broken things wrapped in string. Good intentions, varnished in salt.” 

Avery straightened. The air between them thickened. 

“Listen, I don’t know what your problem is, but—” 

 “You are,” Sebastian said, stepping closer. “You and your little group of misfits.” 

Avery froze. 

 “You’ve always been a storm in someone else’s harbor,” he hissed. “The Baron tolerates you. The missus pities you. That’s all. > You waste space. You sully time.” 

Avery exhaled slowly. “Look, I don’t want a fight. I just wanted—” 

 “You are a fool. A drunkard,” Sebastian cut in, voice like a scalpel. “You drag your tavern friend down. The lost little bookworm too. You hold both of them back. And now you have the nerve not to know your place? To interfere? To involve yourself with the innocent lady of the house as well?” 

He leaned in, words coiled and sharp: 

“Spare her the weight of your shadow.” 

Avery didn’t move; couldn’t move. 

“If you truly care for Miss Rory’s well-being, then you and the rest of your filthy orphan drivel will leave. And never come back.” 

Silence. Heavy and stifling. 

Sebastian’s eyes glittered alight with pure hate. 

The silence that followed wasn’t still. 

It pressed—thick as fog, sharp as glass. Every word Sebastian had thrown echoed back with the precision of a blade that had found its mark. 

Avery stood rooted, fists clenched at his sides, shoulders stiff. He didn’t flinch—but it wasn’t strength holding him there. It was something colder. Older. 

Shame. 

Not for what Sebastian had said—because the man didn’t know the half of it. 

Deep down, a part of him had always believed it to be true. 

Sebastian’s final words still lingered in the air like smoke. 

 	“This isn’t a request. Consider it your first and only warning. Stay away from this place… or you’ll live to regret it.” 

Avery’s jaw tightened. His fist curled slowly around the ribboned gift still tucked beneath his arm. 

He had always wondered if they’d be better off without him. Known Owen deserved someone steadier. Knew Lysanthe needed someone smarter. And Rory… someone not shaped by the sea, fists, and failure. 

His throat went dry. There were things he could say. 

He didn’t. 

He turned. Walked. 

Not fast. Not angry. 

Just a boy trying not to look like he was bleeding. 

 Later the sea would take the sting from his bones.  But for now, he walked slow—like the weight of Sebastian’s words had fused with gravity itself.  And maybe iin this moment… it had. 

At the base of the hill, he paused. Jaw still tight. The weight of the gifts tugged at him—too bright, too kind. Undeserved. 

He looked left, toward the east end of town. The library. Warmth. Owen. Lysanthe. 

He took a step in that direction—then stalled. Breathed. 

“Not now. I’ll ruin it. They’ll see it on my face”. He thought 

So, he turned the other way, down toward the heart of town. 

Toward the tavern. 

Away from the people he loved too much to burden. 

The gifts pressed against his side—a quiet weight. A reminder. 

Not of rejection. 

But of the unworthiness he’d always known he’d never out run. 

 

 

 

Meanwhile, across town, Rory sat in the library with Owen, Emil, and Lysanthe. Morning sunlight filtered through the dust-specked windows. A shaft of light hit the worn table where a little plate of coffee cakes sat half-empty. 

Rory was trying her first cup of coffee—black, bitter, and bewildering—and nibbling at the edge of a sugared scone. 

“I can’t believe you’ve never had coffee, Ro!” Owen exclaimed. 

“I mean, with your whole mansion-on-the-hill thing, I figured you’d be sipping espresso out of gold cups or something.” 

Rory giggled softly.  “Well… with my health, Father worries about things that might not be considered… nutritional.” 

 	“Coffee has plenty of nutrition,” Owen said, grinning. 

 “No, Owie,” Lysanthe laughed, “it has caffeine. Probably not ideal for someone who already has a weaker constitution to regularly drink.” 

Emil sipped his coffee with a half-smile, catching Lysanthe’s eye across the table. 

The moment flickered—brief, bright. 

Then he looked away, a little too quickly. 

Lysanthe felt a flutter low in her stomach. Small. Startling. Like the first note of a song you didn’t realize you’d been waiting to hear. 

“It’s true,” Emil murmured. “Ciaran’s absurdly overprotective. And that pesky butler always has to add his two coppers.” 

They laughed—light and easy. 

Then Rory set her cup down. Her gaze drifted. 

“I had a dream last night… I think it was about you, Lysanthe,” Rory said softly. “It was stranger than the rest. More real.” 

The room was still. 

Lysanthe blinked, brows knitting. “A dream about me?” 

Emil glanced at Rory; uncertain wether he should interfere. 

Owen leaned forward slightly, as if bracing for one of those dreams. 

Rory hesitated, then spoke—quietly, carefully. “I have strange dreams sometimes,” she said. “Places I’ve never seen, but I remember them clearly enough to paint in detail. People and creatures I’ve never met. Songs I’ve never heard but somehow know by heart…” 

She shifted a little in her chair. > “My father says it’s just an overactive imagination. Blames it on being cooped up all the time because of my health.” 

She paused, wrapping her hands around her cup like she needed something solid to hold onto. 

“But sometimes… it feels like more. And this dream—this one—I know it’s important. > I need to share it with you.” 

The room fell into a dense and curious quiet. 

Lysanthe leaned back slightly, discomfort flickering across her face at the mention of prophetic dreams—but curiosity held her still. 

“What was it about?” she asked. 

Rory glanced at her, almost nervously. Owen gently placed a hand over hers, grounding her. 

She breathed in, closed her eyes for a moment—like she needed to find her footing before speaking. 

“There was… a stone fortress,” Rory began. “Ivy-covered. Men in black robes. They came in the night—quiet at first—but then there was fire. People screaming. No time to prepare for the siege. They couldn’t stop it… and soon their screams fell silent.” 

She paused, gaze distant. 

Lysanthe’s pulse stalled in her throat. 

“I think the place…” Rory trailed off, her voice fragile, “was once the ruins in the Darkwood.” 

“There was a girl too.” 

No. No, no—not possible... Lysanthe’s thoughts raced, heart suddenly quickening. 

“She was small. Afraid. She wanted to cry, but someone told her to stay quiet. A woman with green eyes… she told her to be brave.” 

No. No, no, no. She can’t know this… 

“The woman pressed a stone into the girl’s hand. It glowed… softly. She didn’t want to go—she begged to stay. And then a man… he hugged her, whispered in her ear to run, to keep running… and pushed her through the door. Closing it behind her. Forever.” 

Lysanthe couldn’t breathe. She started to shake, eyes wide. 

Emil was already rising; gaze locked on her. 

 “Lysanthe?” He asked gently. “What’s wrong?” 

Owen, who had been transfixed by Rory’s words, finally looked over. His expression shifted from wonder to alarm the moment he saw her. 

She looked like she’d seen a ghost. Pale and trembling 

“L---Lys?” he stammered. 

But Rory continued—unblinking, her voice distant and sure. 

 “She didn’t want to leave, scared wanting her mother, but she ran anyway. She ran and ran… into and out of time.” 

 

Rory blinked, eyes finally landing on Lysanthe—but it was as if she was looking through her. 

Then she closed her eyes, breathed deeply, and when she opened them again, she was back. Back to being the Rory they knew. 

Lysanthe’s fingers fumbled at her tunic, shaking. She tore open the buttons and yanked the leather cord free— 

The adder stone swung between them, catching the light. 

The adder stone swung between them brandishing judgment. 

She stood so fast her chair clattered backwards to the floor. 

 “Is this what you saw?” She demanded, voice trembling...rory looked at her but didnt say anything..twisting her fingers  

“Rory!—look at it! Is this what you saw?”Her voice cracked, rising. 

 “Tell me. Tell me now!” 

Rory flinched, coffee sloshing onto her skirt. 

“Lys—” Owen rose quickly, hand outstretched—half-shielding Rory, half-anchoring Lysanthe. 

“Lysanthe,” Emil said, stepping in and pulling her toward him. 

She resisted at first—shoulders tense, hands caught between retreat and bracing. 

So Emil pulled her closer, gently but firmly. 

She stiffened at the uninvited touch… then softened. Her fingers found the back of his shirt, knotted there. She closed her eyes, trying to anchor herself in the moment, in the warmth. 

He stroked the side of her head with quiet care. 

She could hear his heartbeat from where her ear rested against his chest. Steady. Assuring. Grounding. 

She took a deep, trembling breath. 

 “I’m sorry, Rory,” she whispered. “I didn’t mean to scare you. It’s just… It’s important for me to know.” 

She eased back and held out the stone. It swung faintly in the space between them. 

“This stone—” her voice caught. “Is this the one you saw in your dream?” 

Rory’s eyes flicked down. They locked onto it. 

She hesitated. 

Then—she nodded. 

“Ye—yes.” 

The library stilled. 

Lysanthe’s heart sank. Her world tilted—like she was falling backward into deep water, plunging cold and helpless beneath the surface. 

And somewhere under the floorboards, something answered. 

Not with sound.

I'm watching a movie and have something stuck in my teeth. I always have this little plastic bag of plastic toothpicks/flossers on this coffee table, as I hate getting stuff stuck in my teeth, and I always use these toothpicks to floss my teeth at night. They're ALWAYS on that table. So I'm looking over the table for the toothpick bag, but it is nowhere to be seen. I look over the table many times, scanning it, but no, it's simply not there. As you can tell, I'm very motivated to find this bag, so my search is intense, but without rushing, it's not like I have to find it quickly. There are a few other objects on the table as well, like a bottle, a paper roll, a Switch controller, a coin, a scissor, a couple of books. It's not overly cluttered. I even reach into the drawer of the coffee table to see if the bag is in there, at this point my eyes are literally 5 cm from the left corner of the table. It's not in the drawer. I eventually just drink a sip of water and flush it through my teeth and the bit stuck gets out. Nice.

I continue watching the movie. When it is done, I look over the coffee table again not really thinking about the toothpicks, but there it is, on the left corner of the coffee table, 20cm away from me, the fucking plastic bag with toothpicks! It would've been 5cm from me when I reached for the drawer. There is simply no fucking way I couldn't have seen them! I'm a bit freaked out by it. What the hell? I've never experienced anything quite as blatant as this. I can usually rationalize these sort of things, but this one makes no sense to me. I just don't understand how I could've overlooked it. I am terrible at searching for things, but surely not this terrible. For the record, I was also not under the influence of anything other than sugar. Also, I've been reading a bit about quantum physics lately, where particles behave basically just like this. Have anyone been able to find a link between the two? I doubt it, but asking anyway.

Looking for Volunteers to help a young man!

Hey everyone,

My best friend’s brother (27M) recently moved from Turkey and is currently living in the Sunset District. He’s working on improving his English and trying to meet new people, but hasn’t had much opportunity yet and doesn’t have many local friends.

I thought maybe there are folks here who’d be open to casually meeting up — not in a formal teaching setting or any expectation, just chatting over coffee or a walk. He’s super kind, respectful, and curious about different things like entrepreneurship, cinema, digital marketing, video games and culture in general. He is now working in his new project, a website.

If anyone is up for a low-key language exchange or just wants to make a new friend, feel free to DM me. It would mean a lot and could really help him feel more connected here.

Thanks in advance!

1lm86sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1lm86sy/the_turbulent_torrid_tale_of_the_terrible_toxic/,The turbulent torrid tale of the terrible toxic tick,"Once upon a time in the magical kingdom of Nod, there lived a terrible toxic tick, also known as Lori.  She was a person with vast, cavernous insecurities who would carefully script every interaction so that she was the one up.  She speaks, you listen.  She instructs, you learn.  She commands, you obey.  The thing was that she was a coworker, not a manager in any way.

She had this skill though, of bending management to her will and thus became known as ""The Alabama Tick"" from the movie, Predator where Jesse Ventura says bad guys are dug in deeper than an Alabama Tick, because no one could get to them yet.  The Tick used a protected status as a sword and shield.  Whenever she would cross the line, she threatened to sue, and it would go away.  If you looked at her wrong, she was filing a complaint against you.  At one point she put in for a promotion, but a friend of mine on the board mentioned that she was, ""a piece of human excrement.""

She particularly loved reporting people to management for taking a 16 minute coffee break or a 46 minute lunch.  Important things like that.  Then, she was moved into a position where she oversaw a particular type of paperwork and she went on the rampage.  Only if you bowed and scraped before her would your paperwork get approved.  She also became known as Conan the Grammarian.  She would berate you in public over having three spaces after a period or two spaces after a comma.  She would scream at people over the use of a colon vs a semi colon.  

She would play people off against each other, telling one person a lie about another and then sit back and watch the fireworks.  She would watch everyone, trying to learn some weakness that she would exploit.  Another section called her, The Eye of Sauron.

Her boss, who was overall a decent person, would always take her side out of fear of a lawsuit.  She would make a dramatic entrance to the area, waving her hand dismissively, saying very loudly, ""we have a problem with an employee,"" and then going into the supervisor's office and shutting the door.  After an hour, some poor sap would get chewed out over something minor or even fictitious.  A friend of mine got hammered for having sand on the floorboard of his work vehicle and the Tick accused him of going to the beach on work time.  He lives by the beach and has to walk on the sand to get to the car.

That supervisor moved and a no nonsense guy took over.  She spent an hour in his office complaining about every employee who didn't bow and scrape to her.  He heard her out and then said, ""Get the f out of my office and get back to work.""

Without her top cover the tide had turned.  My part in the story was when I was working on some important legal paperwork and she interrupted me, saying, ""Stop working on that.  You're working for me from now on.""  I would basically be her gopher from then on in.  We went round and round until I told her that if she got a ruling from the head attorney that I wouldn't have to complete the project so that I wouldn't be blamed when the case was lost, I would be all hers.  (that would never happen)  So, the Tick declared war on me.  I could never get my paperwork through and she would berate me in public for minor errors.  I endured her crap for almost two years before the tide changed.

There is a certain physical qualification for the job that we had to complete four times a year and I was put in charge of that at one point.  She had always been terrible at it.  I went up to her at her desk and said, ""So, you want to play this game?  Okay, let's play this game.""

I stood behind her at the quals, berating her in the same way.  ""Are you trying to fail?  What's your major malfunction?""  I'd watch her flailing from the tower and call out on the PA, ""All those (only her) who have failed the qualification report to the tower immediately for retraining!"" so that she would be the only one crawling up to the tower to get chewed out.

I would walk into the office area and wave my hand dismissively and call out loudly, ""We have a problem with an employee.""

Amazingly, her harassment stopped against me.  But she then targeted others.

But she finally lost it when she refused to budge on moving an important case forward, making up rules to justify her actions.  She had to meet with the head of the office and became unglued, screaming at him.  Five minutes later, she was removed from her position and given clerical duties.  A month later, in an all employee meeting, we all approached her replacement and loudly declared that he had turned the department around and that he was doing a wonderful job.  ""It was so toxic before!"" we said, knowing that she was right nearby at the snack table.  She threw her bagel to the ground and ran out, putting in medical retirement fifteen minutes later.

On her final day, we had a screen set up at the exit and played the clip of the Eye of Sauron falling and being destroyed as she walked out.  No one's heard from her since.",11,1751066388.0,revengestories,1,1.0,False

For those who are growing indoor plants and want to add that extra boost by adding supplemental co2 (carbon dioxide) effectively, either there was no ""effective"" option

Or

IT WOULD DRILL A HOLE IN YOUR POCKETS

Especially for first time growers, the costs would be minimum 15k and would go upto 40k for a very basic automation system that delivers 800-1200ppm of Co2 to your plants. AUTOMATICALLY

But

I have finally CRACKED the code

And

I remember how it broke my heart everytime and everywhere I tried to find budget options that actually made sense to spend. Sadly, the budget options like 

baking soda + salt or vinegar etc 
Co2 packs 
Breathing over your plants (Lol)

Are just a Waste Of Time & Money. You'd be better off without them and saving your money (dunno bout you but even losing small money felt like losing to me)

And so, I decided to build my own automation system which cost me a lot of research and headache but just 2.5k in cash (or crypto because I wanted to be stealth about it ;D). So after seeing it work in action I decided to help the community and especially the first timers who cannot afford co2 systems like Inkbird, Vivosun or AC infinity. So without more introduction, here's the meat

 It's very simple and easy actually. 
All you need is to buy some things which are easily available on Amazon (you may even buy locally to save more bucks).

After buying you just need to connect them together to build a fully functional system for just 20% of the price. 

Things you will buy: 
- Co2 sensor (not the built ones but look only for the actual sensor like a small 2-3cm device) 
- Co2 cylinder/tank
- Yamato Co2 Regulator 
- Solenoid Valve
- Flow control needle valve 
- Co2 supply tube 1 meter
- Arduino UNO r3
- 5v relay
- I2c display
- Breadboard (optional)
- Wires and cables
- cases and holders (optional)

What to do: 

Connect the co2 filled cylinder to a co2 regulator, solenoid Valve and a needle valve (In that order). It's very important not to connect the needle valve before the solenoid valve to avoid system failure and pressure hazards. 

Next add the co2 tubing as per your need, you may need more or less length than me depending on where you place the cylinder and where you want the co2 but generally better to place nearby so the leftover co2 in the tube doesn't cause spikes in the system. 

Once that is setup, it's time for the actual drama. 

Connect 2 wires (live + neutral) to the solenoid valve, make sure one of them goes through the 5v relay and the other directly connects to the power socket. Connect the relay header pins to the Arduino using female to male jumper wires. 

Now connect all the other devices to your Arduino. The i2c display connects to the i2c  pins and also the 5v power socket on the Arduino. The sensor either uses a UART or I2c connection depending on the model so make sure you check that before you buy and the 5v and ground from the sensor also go to the 5v and ground on the Arduino board. Alternatively, you can buy a small breadboard to manage the connections more neatly and effectively. 

Finally the connections are done and now you need to plug in the Arduino to your laptop/pc, use the IDE software to flash the code to Arduino and viola!

How it works: 
The sensor reads the co2 levels in the atmosphere and sends it to the Arduino. The Arduino then sends this data to the display so you can view realtime readings, it also sends a signal to the relay to switch on if the readings are below desired level and switch off if the readings are higher than desired levels. The relay when switch on closes the circuit to the solenoid valve and now the solenoid switches on, supplying co2 into the needle valve. The needle valve further regulated the flow depending on how much you set it to. And then directs the co2 into the grow tent or grow area through the co2 tubing. 

That's it!

It’s only week 2 and I feel like I’m drowning a bit. I consider myself smart and personable but for some reason since starting I don’t find myself to be much of either. For the first week I shadowed the previous coordinator who is leaving for law school, and she was amazing. Bubbly, extremely personable, sharp and enthusiastic. She shared me to her google drive folders one of which consisted her performance reviews which were full of praise. 

I find myself struggling a bit to get acclimated. Its taking me very long to do basic tasks, like creating a simple PowerPoint. Also a few of my emails sent out to my boss have consisted of typos. How can I be more sophisticated and sharp with my admin work? Will starting to drink coffee help? I can’t help but to feel that they are all disappointed and missing the previous coordinator just because of how well she did everything and got along with everybody. 

Any tips for getting more sharp and precise with my work and also showing that naturally more personable and open side of me?

1lm80ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/RewardVault/comments/1lm80ad/when_does_taco_bell_start_serving_lunch_the/,When Does Taco Bell Start Serving Lunch? The Definitive Guide to Bell Timing,"You're standing outside Taco Bell at 10:30 AM, stomach growling, wondering when does Taco Bell start serving lunch. Maybe you tried ordering a Crunchwrap and got hit with ""we're still on breakfast"" – the ultimate fast-food buzzkill. Here's the thing: Taco Bell's lunch timing isn't as straightforward as you'd think, and knowing the system gives you the edge.

Most people assume fast food means ""same menu, all day."" But Taco Bell plays by different rules, and understanding when does Taco Bell start serving lunch can be the difference between getting your craving satisfied or settling for hash browns when you want nachos.

The short answer? Usually 11 AM. But the real answer involves franchise flexibility, location quirks, and some insider knowledge that'll make you the Taco Bell timing expert in your crew.

# The Standard Answer: 11 AM (But Read the Fine Print)

According to Taco Bell's official website, lunch starts at 11 AM and runs until 2 PM. This is the corporate standard, the baseline you can count on at most locations. When does Taco Bell start serving lunch officially? 11 AM sharp, transitioning from their breakfast menu to the full lunch arsenal.

But here's where it gets interesting – and where knowing the system pays off. Some locations start serving lunch items as early as 9 AM, running both breakfast and lunch menus simultaneously. Others stick religiously to the 11 AM start time.

The key is understanding that franchise owners have flexibility within Taco Bell's guidelines. Your local Bell might be the early bird that starts lunch at 9:30 AM, or they might wait until exactly 11 AM. It's worth checking your specific location's timing.

# Breaking Down the Breakfast-to-Lunch Transition

# The Breakfast Window: 7 AM to 11 AM

Taco Bell breakfast typically runs from 7 AM to 11 AM, though some locations open as early as 6:30 AM or as late as 9 AM. During these hours, you're working with their breakfast-specific menu – Breakfast Crunchwraps, hash browns, breakfast burritos, and coffee that's surprisingly decent.

The transition point is crucial. Most locations stop taking breakfast orders at 10:45 AM, giving kitchen staff time to prep for the lunch changeover. This 15-minute buffer zone is when you might get caught between menus.

# The Overlap Period: The Golden Window

Here's the insider knowledge: some Taco Bell locations offer both breakfast and lunch items simultaneously between 9 AM and 11 AM. This overlap period is like finding a secret menu – you can get breakfast items alongside early lunch options.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

When does Taco Bell start serving lunch at these locations? As early as 9 AM, but you'll need to ask specifically. Not all staff members advertise this flexibility, so knowing to request lunch items during breakfast hours can unlock options others miss.

# The Official Lunch Launch: 11 AM

At 11 AM, the full lunch menu becomes available everywhere. This is when you get guaranteed access to the complete Taco Bell experience – tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, and all their specialty items. No more wondering about availability or menu limitations.

# Location Variations: Why Your Bell Might Be Different

# Franchise Owner Flexibility

Individual franchise owners can adjust serving times within corporate parameters. This means the Taco Bell near your office might start lunch at 10 AM, while the one by your gym waits until 11 AM. Franchise owners make these decisions based on local customer patterns and staffing.

Some high-traffic locations in business districts start lunch earlier to accommodate office workers' schedules. College town locations might extend breakfast later to serve late-rising students. Understanding your local Bell's specific timing gives you the advantage.

# Regional Differences

Different regions have different approaches to when does Taco Bell start serving lunch. West Coast locations often start earlier, around 9 AM or 10 AM, while some East Coast locations stick closer to the 11 AM standard. This isn't a hard rule, but regional dining patterns influence timing decisions.

Urban locations frequently offer more flexibility than suburban ones. City Bells deal with varied schedules – early commuters, late workers, shift schedules – so they often accommodate with extended or overlapping menu availability.

# The Menu Reality: What Changes When Lunch Starts

# What You Gain at Lunch

When lunch officially starts, you unlock Taco Bell's full arsenal:

* **Classic Tacos** – Crunchy and soft shell options
* **Specialty Burritos** – Beyond just breakfast varieties
* **Quesadillas** – The cheese-pull champions
* **Nachos** – From basic to fully loaded
* **Crunchwrap Supreme** – The hexagonal hero
* **Chalupas** – Crispy shell perfection

# What You Lose from Breakfast

The trade-off for lunch starting means breakfast items disappear. No more Breakfast Crunchwraps, hash browns, or breakfast-specific burritos. Some locations offer limited breakfast items throughout the day, but don't count on it.

This timing knowledge becomes crucial when you're craving something specific. Want both breakfast and lunch items? Hit that golden overlap window at locations that offer it.

# Strategic Timing: How to Work the System

# For the Freshest Food

Arrive right when lunch starts – usually 11 AM. You'll get first access to fresh lunch items, shorter wait times, and peak menu availability. The kitchen's just transitioned, so everything's hot and ready.

# For Menu Flexibility

Target the 9:30-10:30 AM window at locations known for menu overlap. Call ahead to confirm – some locations are more flexible than others about serving lunch items during breakfast hours.

# For Shortest Lines

The 11 AM lunch start creates a natural rush as people wait for menu changeover. Consider arriving at 11:15 AM to avoid the initial wave while still getting fresh food.

# How to Check Your Local Taco Bell's Lunch Schedule

# Use the Store Locator

Taco Bell's official store locator shows specific hours for each location. This includes when does Taco Bell start serving lunch at your particular restaurant. It takes 30 seconds and saves disappointment.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Call Ahead Strategy

A quick phone call confirms lunch start times and any location-specific variations. Ask about menu overlap periods – some locations offer this flexibility but don't advertise it.

# Mobile App Intelligence

The Taco Bell app shows real-time menu availability for your location. If lunch items appear before 11 AM, you know that location offers early lunch service.

# Comparing Taco Bell to Other Chains

# The Breakfast-Lunch Divide

Most fast-food chains handle breakfast-to-lunch transitions differently. McDonald's famously struggled with all-day breakfast, while chains like Subway serve the same menu all day. Taco Bell's approach sits in the middle – structured but with flexibility.

When does Taco Bell start serving lunch compared to competitors? McDonald's typically switches at 10:30 AM, Burger King around 10:30-11 AM, and Wendy's at 10:30 AM. Taco Bell's 11 AM standard is slightly later, but their overlap flexibility at some locations provides more options.

# The Advantage of Knowing

Understanding Taco Bell's system gives you an edge over casual customers. While others wait until official lunch hours, you can potentially access lunch items earlier at flexible locations.

# Making the Most of Lunch Hours

# Peak Times to Avoid

11:30 AM to 1 PM represents peak lunch rush. If you're flexible with timing, arriving right at 11 AM or after 2 PM provides better service and shorter waits.

# Value Timing

Taco Bell's ""Happier Hour"" runs 2-5 PM daily, offering $1 medium sodas and Freeze drinks. This overlaps perfectly with extended lunch hours, combining lunch items with discounted beverages.

# Customization Opportunities

Lunch hours offer full menu customization options. You can modify items, add extras, and create custom combinations that aren't available during limited breakfast periods.

# The Weekend Factor

# Saturday and Sunday Variations

Weekend schedules often differ from weekday timing. Some locations start lunch earlier on weekends to accommodate brunch crowds, while others maintain standard hours. Saturday and Sunday timing for when does Taco Bell start serving lunch can vary significantly.

Weekend locations in entertainment districts might extend breakfast later to serve late-night crowds, while suburban locations might start lunch earlier for family dining.

# Special Circumstances and Exceptions

# Holiday Schedules

Holidays can affect when does Taco Bell start serving lunch. Some locations adjust hours entirely, while others maintain normal lunch timing but with modified overall hours. Major holidays might see earlier or later lunch starts depending on expected customer patterns.

# Limited-Time Offers

Special promotions or limited-time menu items might affect lunch timing. New product launches often coincide with lunch hours to maximize exposure, sometimes resulting in extended or modified serving times.

# Pro Tips for Taco Bell Lunch Timing

# The Early Bird Strategy

If you're consistently early for lunch, identify locations that start serving lunch items before 11 AM. Build relationships with staff who can confirm when lunch items become available.

# The Backup Plan

Always have a second location in mind. If your primary Taco Bell hasn't started lunch service, knowing another nearby location's timing provides options.

# The Technology Advantage

Use the mobile app to check real-time menu availability and pre-order lunch items. This eliminates guesswork about timing and ensures your order's ready when you arrive.

# The Bottom Line: When Does Taco Bell Start Serving Lunch?

When does Taco Bell start serving lunch? The standard answer is 11 AM, but the smart answer is ""it depends on your location, and knowing the variations gives you the advantage.""

Most Taco Bell locations transition from breakfast to lunch at 11 AM sharp. However, some locations offer lunch items as early as 9 AM, running concurrent menus until the official breakfast end time. The key is understanding your local Taco Bell's specific approach and timing your visits accordingly.

The system isn't complicated once you understand it. Corporate sets the baseline at 11 AM, but franchise owners have flexibility to accommodate local dining patterns. Some locations embrace this flexibility, while others stick to standard timing.

Your move? Check your local Taco Bell's specific lunch timing, identify any overlap periods, and plan accordingly. Whether you're chasing an early Crunchwrap or timing your visit to avoid lunch rush, knowing when does Taco Bell start serving lunch at your location gives you the control to satisfy cravings on your schedule.

Remarkably neat, reader-friendly narrative of a 50+ long-term unemployed and abused woman relatively easily and very quickly escaping her abuser, then almost effortlessly finding a safe place to live, a trusted support network, a nice new job and renewed hope within a single week. Because it’s that easy, right? More women should do it like this! 

OP does not engage with police or women’s aid networks — that would be easy to slip up on 

OP does not have children — again this simplifies the narrative. There are pets, but op repeatedly emphasises that the violent ex is besotted with them, so kind MNers do not need to worry about their safety

OP has a night in a hotel and then a touching reunion with her semi-estranged stepbrother who, after one phone call, lets her move into his spare room that same day

Two days later, OP’s stepbrother’s nice neighbour offers to hook OP up with a job, having known her 24 hours. (They all met because they were out in the garden at the same time enjoying the weather) 

A day or two after that, OP and her stepbrother impulsively go away on an overnight visit to a coastal village they loved as children. It is idyllic

Somewhere in there, OP takes a ‘flying monkeys’ phone call from the adult daughter of her violent ex and, satisfyingly for the reader, thinks of exactly the right thing to say to her 

The first day at the new job is great and OP’s new pals invite her to come to their yoga class next week

OP has a lovely birthday and humbly marvels at how MN has helped her relaunch her life in the space of just over a week 

Lots of secondary characters. Plenty of convenient things lining up to make it all possible. Reflections on the simple pleasures of a cake and coffee at a cafe, or blisters from a wholesome walk. And a birthday!

I first started adapting it into a screenplay before I got burned out around halfway through, and recently attacked the concept again by reimagining it as a novelization. This is the first draft of Chapter one, and I don't pretend to be any great writer. But I'm gonna leave it here to see if the wonderful people on this sub see any potential or whether I should delete it and start from scratch lol. 

# Chapter one

The quiet spring night seems to buzz with the activity of the newly awakened life that has been resigned to hibernation since last October as the mists coming off of the Pacific creep lazily between the redwoods and pine trees that line the desolate backroads and highways. Should one travel down Highway 101, whose faded asphalt dissects the west coast like a scalpel, one will find a leaning and somewhat tired looking sign about halfway into the state of Washington. The sign, a holdover of the 1950s when Eisenhower rapidly expanded the US highways, still proudly displays its original message, now almost three quarters of a century old: “Olympia! An all American city”

 This place, now quiet and slowly lapsing into the gradual decay and atrophy known to so many smaller towns and cities across the country, was once the birthplace of a creation. I hesitate to specify what sort of creation, not simply because I do not wish to spoil the story, but because I do not believe I could sum it precisely and effectively if I were to try. I must then, it seems, put pen to paper and set the entire tale out for the world to judge. Most I am sure will scorn the spectacular events that occurred over the course of ‘86, and I can’t say I blame them. Had I not been a knowing and even integral part in the chain of events and their implications I wouldn’t believe a single soul who tried to tell me the same. I’d probably ask them what they were smoking and if they would be willing to share whatever illicit and clearly effective substance they had partaken in to concoct such a vivid and frankly ludicrous narrative. But I digress. I’ve spent enough time wasting ink and paper on needless babbling, so I guess I’d better stop stalling and get on with telling you my story. 

Now where to begin? I suppose I must go to the beginning, but that would require starting at the creation of the universe and I don’t have the time to write all of what was witnessed there. So I guess our story will have to start with a man. 



If you were to bump into Michael Powell on the street, it would be easy to look past him without a second thought or glance. He was average in height, with a slender build, and little in the way of defining features. His dark blonde hair was shaggy and unkempt, and his face bore the signs of obvious neglect, with a perpetual growth of stubble around his chin and underneath his slightly crooked nose. His standard uniform of ripped jeans and worn crewneck T shirts was typical of many young men in the area, and his sneakers, while not stylish, served their purpose with a utilitarian duty. In short he was the very picture of the ‘grunge’ movement…except he was about six years too early to participate in it. His one striking feature was his eyes, which shone in a bluish grey hue that seemed to carry more than his twenty four years would suggest. They were burned with a ferocious intelligence that was always tempered by some form of inebriation, but when he was sober those eyes were all too aware of the reality of their situation, and it looked to be more than they could bear.

On this particular day, Michael — or Mike, as he was known to the few who could tolerate him — was walking the streets of Olympia, as he often did after a spring rain. His Walkman was clipped to his jeans, fluorescent orange headphones snug over his ears, both hands buried deep in the pockets of his leather jacket.

The rains had returned, but winter hadn't fully released its grip; his breath still fogged in the cold, and the frost on the rooftops and in the few green blades of grass caught the morning light like broken glass.

The tape spinning inside his Walkman was an album Chad had lent him — something from a band out of Minnesota. Hüsker Dü? He wasn’t sure how to pronounce it. *Candy Apple Grey*, the album was called.

He gave it a chance. And then another.

“Not my favorite,” he muttered, “but not bad.”

His ramblings took him past the record store and music shop. Half the neon letters on the sign were dead, the other half flickered with a weary and bitter determination to stay lit. He peeked inside for a moment before opening the cloudy and cracked glass door and walking inside. 

The walls of the store were lined with rows upon rows of guitars and basses-Fenders, Gibsons, Ibanez, Gretsch, Yamaha, and so many weird one off guitars that were imported from Japan during the lawsuit era. Mike walked towards the back where the records were, eyeing the guitars longingly. He knew he had a perfectly good guitar back home, a 1967 MIJ Les Paul Junior he’d bought at a junk sale when he was 17, but damn did those shiny expensive guitars look good. “No way man, you’re broke. Remember?” The voice came from the corner of the store, where a lanky figure stood bent over a record player in the corner, listening intently to an album. Mike swaggered over to him, unphased “says the junkie who can’t hold down a job”.

 The listener turned around to face Mike, revealing baggy and tired eyes that sparkled with good humor. “Good to see you too man, how’ve you been doing today?”  “Doing alright Shaun, how ‘bout you?” Mike glanced at the album spinning on the record player “enjoying some Replacements I see? *Excellent choice my good sir*” Mike’s hilariously bad imitation of an English accent was a running gag between the two, and had been for several years.

Mike turned and began to flip through the records, occasionally selecting one for closer inspection, before returning it to the rack. Shaun eyed him with an appraising glance. “You looking for something special huh?” Ignoring the question, Mike continued searching, before finally pulling a dusty and faded album from the back with a yell of triumph. “No way! They’ve got it!” Shaun looked over, studying the album with a slight air of contempt “Eddie Cochran? You can’t be serious” Mike disregarded the jab, hugging the vinyl to his chest in obvious delight “whatever man, you wouldn’t get it. This guy was one of the best, one of the founding fathers of rock n’ roll. We’re part of his legacy” 

Shaun turned and started digging through his own stack of records, pulling out album after album and setting them aside for closer inspection later. Mike didn’t pay him any attention, he was too busy looking for his own treasures to add to his record collection. His eyes lit up each time he found a name or cover he recognized, and soon he had a stack almost as big as Shaun’s. The two looked up at each other, their mission completed. Mike sized up his friend’s pile with an approving gaze, “not bad Shaun, you’ve got what- maybe *three* records in there that aren’t total pieces of crap!” Shaun rifled through Mike’s selection, scoffing at the hodgepodge mix of alternative rock and oldies “I’ve got crap? What the hell do you call this then Mikey?” He lifted a Patsy Cline record from the pile gingerly, holding it at arms length like it was toxic. Mike snatched the album back, returned it to his pile, and scooped up the stack as he started towards the counter “I call it class music, something you wouldn’t know too much about”

The two sauntered up to the counter, plopping their finds down on its surface as they stood back waiting for someone to come help them. “Hello?” Shaun said, craning his neck to look towards the employees only area of the store as he slammed his fist on a bell resting on the desk “We’d like to buy this stuff here”

Mike, absentmindedly studying the posters on the wall, wasn’t paying attention as the young woman came out from behind the curtain that hid the break room but that didn’t last long. “Damn, you guys cleaned us out.” She was tall, with light hazel eyes and shoulder length strawberry blonde hair. She looked quietly at Mike for a moment and he looked back. He didn’t say a word, he barely dared to breathe. It was a moment that seemed to stretch for an eternity between them…Before Shaun plopped his stack of albums on the counter with a resounding thud that shattered the moment in an instant.  

“Jesus!” said the girl behind the counter, startled by the noise just like Mike was. She collected herself and began quietly counting the stack of albums the Shaun dropped, shooting glances at Mike the whole time. Mike for his part quietly placed his selections on the counter next to Shaun’s, he stood there as she counted, trying desperately to look anywhere besides her eyes, or her hair, or her freckles, or her smile… “Your total’s gonna be $87.98 with tax” 

Mike’s reverie was cut short as Shaun tugged on his sleeve “You got like $20 extra? I’m not really that liquid right now man” Mike sighed, pulling out his wallet and flipping through bills before passing them to her as she counted up the total. “Alright” she said, retrieving a few dollars and some coins “here’s your change”. Her fingers brushed the palm of Mike’s hand and it sent a jolt of electricity shooting up his arm and into his mind, lighting  up the inside of his head like fireworks on the fourth of July. “T-Thanks” he stammered, not bothering to count the money or even look at it as he shoved it into his jacket pocket. She giggled a little at his condition, clearly finding it amusing that someone could be so smitten so quickly. She handed Shaun the bags of records, only sparing him a passing glance before returning her gaze to Mike. “y’all have a good day now” She called as the two stumbled out the door, Shaun leading Mike by the arm out into the streets of Olympia. 

Mike didn’t talk much on the way home, his mind just wasn’t there. It was back in that dusty old record store —back with her. Back with her eyes and her smile and maybe, just maybe, his name whispered from her lips.  He wondered if he was overthinking, that was a sin he often found himself guilty of, he thought. Was he just projecting what he wanted onto her? Yeah that seemed more than likely. He hadn’t gotten her name, that’s what bugged him more than anything. She’d been wearing a name tag, he knew that much, but he’d neglected to read it because he’d been lost in her eyes and her smile, and away he went again. “Get a grip man,” he muttered to himself “what’d you say?” Shaun looked over inquisitively. They were about two blocks away from home, and Mike didn’t want to share any of what he was thinking before he had some food and a nap. “Nothing man” Mike brushed the question away, retreating into his thoughts again. In his mind he picked the petals off of daisies, questioning again and again whether it was all in his head or if he’d actually stumbled on something special when he was least prepared for it.

Mike and Shaun soon rounded the corner onto Torrance Avenue, passing house after house, all identical with their freshly painted fences and clean cut grass. They turned in at the last house on the street, a run down affair that the neighbors would politely refer to as ‘an eyesore’. The fence was unpainted and sagging, the lawn grew wild and patchy, and the whole property held a distinct air of lived in neglect that mortified the other residents of Torrance Avenue. 

Shaun kicked open the battered gate. It swung balefully open with a rusty whine and stayed open, looking defeated. Mike followed him through the yard, walking up to the front door as Shaun rooted around in his pockets with his free hand for his keys. “Damn, where the hell did I put those?” “I’ve got it.” Mike said, fishing his own key out and unlocking the front door. “Thanks man” Shaun said gratefully, “*but of course my good sir*” Mike said, waving Shaun inside with a flourish before following him in and slamming the door with a crash.

“Honey, we’re home” Shaun called as he tramped through the hall into the sitting room, kicking off his sneakers and dropping his bag of records on the coffee table before flopping on the couch with a sigh of exhausted contentment. A voice echoes from out of the kitchen “welcome back boys, you managed not to get arrested? Gotta say I’m proud.” The owner of the voice lumbered into the living room, the old floorboards creaking slightly with every step. He was a big man, with broad shoulders, a slight beer belly, and a squarish head. A steaming mug of tea was cupped in his meaty fingers, and his feet were clad in a pair of fuzzy slippers. He stood there, sizing up Shaun flopped on the sagging and dilapidated couch. 

“Sup, Chad? Don’t worry—the feds picked up Shaun for selling dope but they left him off with a warning.” Mike walked into the kitchen, opening the fridge and digging through before grabbing the ingredients to make himself a sandwich. “Did he? And I thought you were going clean,” he said reproachfully, bending over to pick up Shaun’s sneakers and put them in a shoe rack by the door before looking into the bags of records Shaun and Mike had brought back from the shop. “You jackasses get anything good?” Shaun sat up, stretching dramatically with a theatrical yawn “I got some good shit, no clue what kind of junk Mikey got.”

Mike came from the kitchen, his ham and cheese sandwich in one hand and a glass of milk in the other. “I don’t know what you’re talking about man,” he said, taking  a big bite of his sandwich and washing it down with a tall drink of his milk. A thick white milk moustache clung to the scruff on his upper lip as he struggled to speak  “my taste is…” he swallowed “…impeccable.” 

“Yeah? Well whatever man,” Shaun flipped through his albums before putting one on the battered record player in the corner, ‘Rocket to Russia’ by the Ramones. Chad sat on the couch next to Shaun, and they both sat, enjoying the opening riffs of the first track. Mike shrugged, grabbing his albums and climbing up the stairs to his room. 

Mike’s room was a temple to order within chaos. Faded posters were tacked haphazardly on the walls, dirty laundry scattered across the floor, and the carpet was spotty and worn. He ignored the mess and made straight for his record player in the corner, retrieving the Eddie Cochran album from his bag, and placed it on the turntable. The needle caught the groove and a grainy voice echoed from the speakers, an echo of a kinder time. He flopped onto his bed, letting the notes envelop him as Eddie wailed on about his rock n’ roll blues as he slowly drifted into a deep sleep. He dreamed of the girl from the record store, of her hair, of her beautiful voice, and of so many other things that his mind couldn’t quite place. For some reason the voice from the past emanating from the record seemed to warp and distort in a way that bothered his sleeping mind.  

Mike didn’t know it, but it would be the last normal night of sleep he’d have for a long time.

1lm7y1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1lm7y1v/the_boy_who_saved_my_life/,The Boy Who Saved my Life,"Even I was a teen once…

A few months ago, I was browsing the internet and stumbled across an old website that I used when I was a teenager. Before Facebook, Myspace, Tumblr, Reddit, there was a little journaling website called “LiveJournal.” You would write journal entries, make friends, and it was like a proto-social media website. My younger self was so in to letting everyone know how I felt.

I was one of those kids that was in to self-expression. I wrote, I journaled, I even started a zine and a distro when I was 19. I thrived on creativity, so LiveJournal was like a place to wax poetically about losing my virginity and how much I hated my parents.

I laughed to myself and reflected on my LiveJournal. I had never deleted it. Was it still there? It took a couple of tries, and a shocking memory that figured out the email and password, but I was able to login! I was able to access my journal from 24 years ago! This was the journal of a gay kid just starting to figure himself out. This was my journal.

I have made 297 journal entries. I had basically documented every aspect of my final days of high school through my third year of college. I posted at least three times a week. So, what did I do, I printed that journal off, fixed myself a cup of coffee, and started to read.

First thoughts that echoed through my brain. “Who the hell is this!” I didn’t recognize him. There was a layer of cognitive dissonance when you read things you wrote so many decades ago. It’s like a different person, a person you no longer recognize. To me, this was like a tulpa that I had conjured from nothing. I didn’t recognize his pain, I didn’t recognize his joy, none of it seemed real. I felt like this was a changeling that must have replaced me at some point.

And then, I hated him. I thought he was weak. I thought he was sniveling. I couldn’t stand to read what he wrote. I wanted to scream “DON’T DO THAT” like I was watching a horror movie, and someone had just yelled “I’ll be right back.” This person, this person was me, but I didn’t know him, and because I didn’t know him, I didn’t relate to him.

As I read his last journal entry, something about going to some Buddhist get together, I started to understand him. My shadow, my past, my tulpa. I realized, the person that looks into people’s souls and helps them navigate through this life was forming there. The person who became a dad, the person who became a husband, he was forming. This boy fought for me to be able to marry. This boy took on the bruises of bad relationships, bad friendships, and stayed kind.

And at that moment, I realized something earth-shattering. That boy, that little 18-year-old, saved my life. He fought. He survived. And because he did all that, I can speak to you all today. I started to read about how he marched for the right to marry when it wasn’t legal anywhere, certainly not here in Puerto Rico. I read about how he stood down bullies. I read about he was out on that soccer team when nobody else would be. Then, like a ton of bricks, that kid, that kid was my hero. And it all shifted, and I learned to love him. And in learning to love him, I learned how to love myself a little bit more.

Roof is obviously removable, the main one is magnetized to stick in place correctly.

I still have to make all the windows and door border clean with coffee stirrers, work on the destructed walls parts by adding small debris and loose bricks, make a functional double door, ladders to access the upper floors, and I'll be good to varnish it all and start painting and weathering. Obviously the printed parts won't be covered in opaque paints. 

I'm probably not going to make the second part of the building right after, it took longer than I expected. I'll probably weather some cars or assemble a BTR or an helicopter. We'll see!",12,1751065693.0,ZonaAlfa,0,1.0,False

Alright, Reddit, lemme tell you about something that’s seriously upped my apartment game. I’ve been on a quest to make my tiny living space feel bigger and less… chaotic. Anyone else feel like their apartment is constantly trying to swallow them whole with clutter? I needed a solution, and fast.

I'd been seeing these multi-functional living room tables with hidden storage popping up everywhere, and I was intrigued, but also a little skeptical. Were they just trendy space-wasters, or could they actually make a difference? I needed something that looked good, was practical, and wouldn't fall apart after a few months.

Well, after weeks of research (aka endless scrolling), I finally took the plunge. And I'm here to report back: it's a win! I stumbled upon this one while browsing ursupermart.com, and it just clicked. I was specifically hunting for a living room table with hidden storage for books and board games. Those were the main culprits turning my chill zone into a disaster zone.

The hidden storage compartment is seriously the hero of this story. It's like a secret agent disguised as a coffee table. It looks like a regular, stylish table, but lift the top, and boom! Storage galore. I'm talking enough space for all those books I swear I'm going to read, plus the board games that usually live scattered under the sofa.

The biggest win for me is how much more relaxed my living room feels. No more tripping over books or frantically searching for the TV remote. Everything has a home, and it's all right there. It's like having a secret weapon against clutter, and it saves me a ton of time when I'm trying to tidy up before friends come over.

I was worried it would look clunky or like a storage container pretending to be a table, but it doesn't at all. The storage is built right into the design, so it looks intentional and stylish. It actually makes the whole room look better.

And let's talk about the feels, people. I didn't realize how much stress my cluttered living room was causing me until it was gone. Now, when I walk into my living room, I feel calm, organized, and even a little proud. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Plus, I don't have to feel embarrassed when people pop in unexpectedly.

I know it sounds dramatic, but it's true! A clutter-free space really does make a difference in your overall mood. It's amazing how much calmer I feel now that everything has its place. I can actually relax and enjoy my space without feeling overwhelmed by the mess.

I was also surprised by how sturdy it is. I was worried that the lift-top mechanism would be flimsy, but it's actually really solid. I can put my feet up on it without feeling like it's going to collapse.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Okay, but what about the downsides?"" Honestly, I haven't found many. The only thing I can think of is that the storage compartment isn't huge, so if you have a mountain of stuff to store, it might not be enough. But for me, it's the perfect size.

Before, I had a bunch of those plastic bins stacked in the corner, trying to contain the chaos. They weren't exactly pretty, and they took up a lot of floor space. This living room table with hidden storage eliminates the need for all that extra clutter.

My friends have definitely noticed the difference. I've gotten so many compliments on my ""new"" living room. And when I show them the hidden storage, they're always amazed. It's like a magic trick! 🪄

I’ve even found myself using the table for more than just storage. It’s a great surface for working on my laptop, eating dinner while watching TV, or even building Lego sets. It’s truly multi-functional.

If you're looking for a way to declutter your living room and add a touch of style, I highly recommend checking out a coffee table with storage. It's a game-changer, and it's definitely worth the investment. It’s especially great if you're dealing with a small apartment or just want to maximize your space.

I’ve been using it for a few weeks now, and I can honestly say that it's one of the best purchases I've made for my home. It's stylish, functional, and it's helped me create a more organized and relaxing living space. It's given me a sense of satisfaction knowing I've created a space that's both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

If you're curious, this is the one I got: [https://go.ursupermart.com/0Qyt1T](https://go.ursupermart.com/0Qyt1T)

Seriously, if you're struggling with clutter, give it a try. You won't regret it! It's a simple solution that can make a big difference in your daily life. I feel like I can finally breathe in my living room.

Okay, Reddit fam, I gotta share something that's seriously upped my adulting game. I've always struggled with keeping my living room tidy. Like, *always*. Books, blankets, remotes, the occasional rogue sock… it all just piled up. My coffee table was basically a landing strip for clutter. I even got anxiety about guests coming over because I was always scrambling to shove everything in closets. Sound familiar? 😅

Then, I stumbled upon this multi-functional living room table with hidden storage, and honestly? It's been a game-changer. I know, I know, I’m not supposed to say “game changer” because we are supposed to be real people, but it's true! I was specifically looking for a Coffee Table with Storage because I have a small apartment and my boyfriend has way too many video game controllers. I was tired of having to look at them all the time!

Seriously, the hidden storage is where it’s at. It's not just some tiny drawer; it's a legit compartment under the tabletop. Think ample space for blankets, pillows, books, or whatever other chaos tends to accumulate in your living space. I even hide my yoga mat in there! Now, when people drop by unexpectedly, I can do a quick sweep, stash everything away, and *bam*, instant presentable living room! No more frantic closet-shoving!

What really sold me was how seamless the storage is. It doesn't look like some clunky storage unit disguised as a table. It's actually a stylish piece of furniture that blends right into my living room decor. I was specifically looking for a Modern Coffee Table with Storage and this fits the bill. The design is clean and simple, and it comes in different finishes to match your style.

Before this table, I was considering buying a separate storage ottoman or some bulky shelves. But honestly, who has the space (or the budget) for that? This table eliminates the need for extra furniture, saving both space and money.

One of the things I love most is that it’s not just about hiding clutter; it’s about having a more organized living space. I used to waste so much time searching for the remote or digging through piles of blankets. Now, everything has its place, and I know exactly where to find it. It may sound silly, but it's seriously reduced my stress levels. My boyfriend knows where his stuff is now too, so he can't even ask me, and that’s the real win!

I was a little worried about the quality, especially since I was looking for something affordable. But this table is surprisingly sturdy. It feels well-made and durable, and I'm confident it will last for years to come.

Honestly, it's been such a worthwhile investment. It's not just a table; it's a storage solution, a style statement, and a stress reliever all in one.

1lm7x4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1lm7x4v/i_dont_deserve_this/,I Don't Deserve This!,"Me (37m) and wife (34f) have been married just shy of 5 years and together for 10 years. We own a beautiful home, have dogs, good jobs.

Few weeks ago, she filed for divorce.

Background: My wife has suffered from some low-self esteem and body image issues for a long time. She doesn't have many friends (her wedding party for example consisted of her sister and my sisters). Her parents divorce. Her mother bounced from guy to guy to guy ever since I knew her. When she was younger her mother would tell her to walk on the treadmill because she was getting fat.

My wife started to take Zepbound about 2 months ago. She is also on anti-depressants. She dropped a LOT of weight in the span of these 2 months and looks great.

Weird comments started to come from her:

1. ""Wow, this guy bought me coffee today at starbucks""
2. ""I have a fantasy where you watch me have sex with another man""
3. ""My co-worker told me her masturbates to the thought of me"".
4. ""Hey, you are in the military, when you deploy, you deserve a hall-pass with any women you want.... why not?'
5. The final straw a few weeks ago: I was on a trip. I noticed on our home cameras she left the house at 930 pm and returned at 130 am. Not like her at all. These were alerts that popped up on my phone but I figured I'd wait until later that morning with a clear head to ask her about it. Well.... she deleted the footage. I texted her about it and all those other weird comments that occurred prior. ""i love you so much, it's not what you think, I won't lie i do have fantasies because of more attention I have been getting but they are just fantasies....""

I come home from the trip to calmly confront her on these issues. She acted completely unemotional. She then said ""we probably should have never gotten married. I have been unhappy for a long time. I am going to file for divorce"".

I asked about marriage counseling. She said no.... too late. I scheduled one anyway which she agreed to go to. She unloaded on me in that session. Years ago, we both agreed to not have children. I got a vasectomy. Counselor asked if we have children: ""no, we agreed not to have kids, but with the \*right man\* I would"". THAT hurt. She gaslit me the entire session. I didn't even recognize her and I no longer do.

She admitted to going on a date with a man the weekend after she filed but ""nothing happened"". She said ""marriage is just a piece of paper"". She said ""she has a new self confidence and this marriage no longer fits what she wants"".

Marriage is done and over.... I get it. But gosh, we are still living in this home waiting for the court date. Almost every night she dresses up to go out. I know what she is doing and it hurts. My friend even saw she made a Bumble account.

My flaws: I did get into a routine lately with the marriage and maybe let things get a bit stale. She NEVER communicated her feelings to me with all this. It sucks so much.

She always despised how her mom bounced from man to man but now it looks like she is becoming that.

I am completely blindsided with all of this. It came on so fast.

I understand this marriage is done. But..... wtf is going on in my soon to be ex-wife's head!?",10,1751065646.0,Divorce,12,0.92,False

So I’m finally done pretending instant coffee is fine. I want actual espresso at home. Something with a bit of ritual, good taste, and enough power to make me feel like I know what I’m doing (even if I don’t).

Narrowed it down to three options, all pretty different vibes. Would love thoughts if you’ve used any of these or just wanna help a sleep-deprived caffeine gremlin make a decent choice.

 **Must-haves (for me):**

* Good extraction pressure (20-bar is cool, right?)  
* Some kind of milk frother/steam wand (not just black coffee)  
* Ease of use  
* Either a grinder or a pod-friendly setup  
* Doesn’t take a whole kitchen to clean

I’m leaning toward the 5700Gense for the grinder situation, but part of me wonders if I’ll regret all the extra steps when I’m half awake and just want a decent cup.

Would love to hear from people who’ve used any of these (or if there’s a 4th option I should be obsessed with instead).",1,1751065346.0,u_JollySimple188,0,1.0,False

The year 2020 began with a whisper. Not of a virus, not of political unrest, but of something far more insidious, far more impossible. It started as a glitch in the digital fabric, a flicker in the periphery of the internet’s endless scroll. Grainy, shaky phone videos began to surface: a street performer’s hat hovered for a fleeting second in a Tokyo alley; a lamp in a quiet London flat flickered erratically, then blazed with an impossible, blinding light; a security camera feed from a corporate office captured a coffee cup sliding across a desk, seemingly of its own volition.

The online world, ever hungry for novelty, devoured it. #MagicIsReal trended, quickly followed by #ObviousCGI, #FakeMagic, #Deepfake. Late-night hosts cracked jokes, scientists confidently debunked, and self-proclaimed internet detectives raced to expose the ""hoaxes."" Experts pointed to lens flares, camera tricks, clever editing, mass hysteria, even unreleased drone technology. ""It’s just another fleeting viral fad,"" the collective consciousness declared, comfortable in its cynicism. ""It'll be gone by next week.""

But in the quiet corners of the web, beyond the mocking headlines and the dismissive comments, a different kind of buzz began. Obscure forums, encrypted group chats, and hushed subreddits pulsed with a new kind of fervor. And then, a website appeared, as if conjured from the ether.

I'm wondering on if I should get lattafa ajayeb dubai. It's a sweet, masculine, coffee fragrance, which is what I'm looking for.

And hopefully i can find someone who’s down to have some really cute conversations over coffee/matcha :) What I mean tho is that I’m looking for serious second partner. I am married but practice poly/open marriage and date separately. I’d love someone local but I am down to meeting new people online! I’m also down for friends! <3

a bit about me: I’m from Ky but don’t mind online ! I’m 25 alt/ goth and I’m plus size/ a bbw (from what I’ve been told lmao.) I have black hair have a couple tattoos, septum and wear glasses. I love crafting/sewing while also collecting oddities like bones and bugs. Hence why we should go def do our first date looking through creepy stuff together!

What I’m looking for: someone with similar interests and doesn’t mind introducing me to their cool interests! I prefer someone who is around my age or older (don’t mind older ppl:) someone who knows what they want and it’s similar to what I want. I’m not looking for a short relationship I want something long and passionate while also just being us and being goofy.
I usually ignore the “hey” and “wyd” messages so plssss send me your ASL and a fun fact of yourself if u decide to message pls !! 

We’re both gonna be awk let’s be awk together and get to know one another! Ty for reading don’t hesitate to reach out !!<3",6,1751065191.0,polyamoryR4R,3,1.0,False
