1i7hnk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoForexSyndicate/comments/1i7hnk3/what_major_banks_are_betting_on_in_the_world_of/,What Major Banks Are Betting On in the World of Trading,"Major banks play a pivotal role in global trading markets, leveraging their resources, technology, and expertise to capitalize on various opportunities. From traditional asset classes to cutting-edge digital assets, here’s an in-depth look at what drives the trading strategies of these financial giants.

**1. Foreign Exchange (Forex) Trading**

Forex trading remains a cornerstone of major banks’ operations. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Deutsche Bank dominate the forex market, executing trades on behalf of clients and engaging in proprietary trading.

* High-frequency trading (HFT): Banks use sophisticated algorithms to profit from minute price changes in currency pairs.
* Emerging markets: Many banks focus on trading currencies from developing economies, where volatility creates significant profit opportunities.
* Hedging strategies: Banks assist multinational corporations in hedging against currency risks, while also managing their own exposures.

**2. Equities and Derivatives**

Banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley excel in equity and derivative trading.

* Equity trading: Banks profit from facilitating trades for institutional clients and retail investors, as well as proprietary trading in equities.
* Derivatives: These instruments, including options, futures, and swaps, allow banks to hedge risks and speculate on market movements.
* Market-making: Banks provide liquidity by buying and selling securities, profiting from the bid-ask spread.

**3. Commodities Trading**

Commodities, such as oil, gold, and agricultural products, are another key area for banks.

* Energy markets: Banks trade oil, natural gas, and renewable energy credits, often using futures and options to manage risk or speculate on price changes.
* Metals: Gold and silver are popular as hedges against inflation, while rare metals like lithium attract interest due to the demand from the tech industry.
* Agricultural commodities: Banks trade products like wheat, corn, and coffee, capitalizing on price swings driven by weather or geopolitical events.

**4. Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC)**

The FICC segment is a significant revenue driver for banks, encompassing bonds, forex, and commodities trading.

* Government bonds: Institutions trade U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds, and other sovereign debt, often as part of macroeconomic strategies.
* Corporate bonds: High-yield and investment-grade bonds offer opportunities for trading and structuring complex credit products.
* Interest rate swaps: These allow banks to manage exposure to changing interest rates and help clients hedge against rate volatility.

**5. Digital Assets and Cryptocurrencies**

While traditionally cautious, many banks are now entering the digital asset space.

* Cryptocurrency trading: Banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have begun offering crypto trading desks to institutional clients.
* Blockchain technology: Many banks invest in blockchain for efficiency in settlement and transaction processing.
* Stablecoins and CBDCs: Trading in stablecoins and involvement in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects are gaining traction.

**6. Risk Arbitrage and Event-Driven Strategies**

Banks often capitalize on market inefficiencies caused by specific events.

* Mergers and acquisitions (M&A): Banks trade stocks of companies involved in M&A deals, betting on the spread between the offer price and the current market price.
* Earnings reports: Trading on anticipated or actual results of quarterly earnings can generate significant profits.

**7. Technology-Driven Trading**

Banks heavily invest in advanced technologies to stay competitive in trading.

* Artificial intelligence (AI): AI is used for predictive analytics, risk management, and automating trading strategies.
* Machine learning models: These models help identify patterns and trends in massive datasets, enabling banks to make better trading decisions.
* Quantum computing: Though still nascent, quantum computing is being explored for complex simulations and optimizing trading strategies.

**8. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Investments**

The growing emphasis on sustainable investing has pushed banks to focus on ESG-related trading.

* Carbon credits: Banks trade carbon offsets as part of global efforts to combat climate change.
* Green bonds: Issuing and trading bonds linked to renewable energy and sustainability projects.
* Sustainable ETFs: Banks offer and trade exchange-traded funds focusing on ESG-compliant companies.

**9. How Banks Use TradingView**

[TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) has become an essential tool for banks and traders alike, providing advanced charting features and data visualization. While individual traders use the platform for insights, major banks integrate it to enhance their trading operations.

* Market analysis: Banks utilize TradingView’s comprehensive charting tools to analyze market trends, identify patterns, and inform trading strategies.
* Collaboration: The platform’s ability to share ideas and charts fosters communication between bank analysts and traders.
* Custom indicators: Banks develop proprietary indicators on TradingView’s Pine Script to gain unique insights into the market.
* Integration with technology: TradingView APIs allow banks to integrate real-time data into their broader trading platforms, streamlining decision-making.

Major banks are central to the global trading ecosystem, utilizing their scale and expertise to influence markets. They operate across diverse asset classes, from forex and equities to digital assets and ESG investments, adapting to emerging trends and technological advancements.

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.

## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos

[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.

Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.

These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.

Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.

## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app

[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.

Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.

## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and services

Although Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.

Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.

Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.

## New Gemini extensions for Samsung apps

Google also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:

*   **Samsung Calendar**
    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar
    *   Capture info from images to create events
    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events
*   **Samsung Clock**
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms
    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers
*   **Samsung Notes**
    *   Create and summarize notes
    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles
*   **Samsung Reminder**

Here’s What You Need to Know 🐶💩,"If you’ve ever scooped up after your pup and thought, **“**[**Why is my dog’s poop black**](https://thepetlabco.com/learn/dog/health-wellness/black-dog-poop), but they’re acting normal?”, you’re not alone. 

The color of your dog’s poop can give important clues about their health, but it’s not always easy to know when it’s time to worry. 

Here’s a quick breakdown of what black dog poop could mean and what steps you should take to ensure your furry friend stays healthy.

# What Does Black Dog Poop Look Like?

Black poop in dogs can show up in different consistencies:

* **Black diarrhea**: Liquid stool that looks like coffee grounds.
* **Black tarry poop**: Sticky and tar-like, often signaling bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract (called melena).
* **Hard black poop**: This may suggest constipation combined with gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **Black specks in poop**: This could be from digested blood or undigested food, but sometimes it’s just dirt your pup has eaten!

If your dog’s poop is black because it’s been left in the sun for a while, that’s not usually concerning. But if the poop is freshly black, it’s time to dig deeper.

# Common Causes of Black Poop in Dogs

1. **Bleeding in the Gastrointestinal Tract**:
   * Black, tarry stool (melena) is often caused by blood digested as it travels through the stomach or intestines. Possible reasons include:
      * Stomach ulcers.
      * Intestinal parasites.
      * Foreign objects lodged in the stomach.
      * Bacterial infections or severe liver disease.
2. **Specific Medications**:
   * Some medications can cause black poop without being harmful, such as:
      * **Activated charcoal** (often given for toxin ingestion).
      * **Pepto-Bismol** (not recommended without a vet’s guidance).
3. **Dietary Factors**:
   * If your dog eats raw meat or something bloody, this can also lead to black stool. However, raw meat diets are generally discouraged due to risks of foodborne illnesses.

# When to Worry About Black Dog Poop

If your dog’s poop is black, and they’re showing additional symptoms like vomiting, loss of appetite, or lethargy, it’s time to contact your vet. Seek **emergency attention** if your dog:

* Ingested a toxin or foreign object.
* Shows bruising, bleeding from the mouth or nose, or abdominal pain.
* Is a puppy or unvaccinated adult with diarrhea.

Even if your dog is acting normal, snapping a picture of the poop and collecting a sample for your vet is always a good idea. Stool samples are most useful within 24 hours and should be stored in the refrigerator until your appointment.

# Keeping Your Dog’s Poop Healthy

Here are tips to maintain your dog’s digestive health:

* Feed a high-quality diet recommended by your vet.
* Avoid raw meat, table scraps, and potential toxins.
* Keep your dog on year-round parasite prevention.
* Regularly schedule vet check-ups and vaccinations.
* Supervise your dog with toys and trash to prevent swallowing harmful items.

Remember that while black poop isn’t always an emergency, it’s worth paying attention to. Fresh black stool could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, so don’t hesitate to call your vet. 

Keeping an eye on your pup’s poop might not be glamorous, but it’s an essential part of monitoring their health!

Then I got my girlfriend a Nespresso machine because she's wanted one for a bit and just loves their expresso pods. Now that I didn't need to make enough coffee for both of us I started looking at what options were out there, and settled on finally trying pour over after doing some reading on prep times.

I settled on starting simple and seeing where I took it, a Bodum carafe and stainless steel filter, Bodum Bistro grinder (the cheaper one), Bodum electric gooseneck kettle and a Greater Goods scale. After some trial and error I was able to make a decent cup using James Hoffman's better V60 recipe, then I tripped and fell down the rabbit hole. I tend to like to take deeper dives on stuff that interests me, and I will hyper fixate on new subjects/hobbies if they grab me. I've learned to enjoy the ride and to hold off on buying stuff at least some of the time.

Fast forward to today and I'm still using the same scale, but I've just gotten a Planetary Designs Ethoz flat bottom dripper that I absolutely love, makes a tasty cup with next to no sediment. Feel like it is a great upgrade to what I was using and I got their carafe so I can try the regular V60 with a paper filter that I've ordered as well. I figure the next eventual upgrade will be my grinder and a temperature control kettle, but I'm really enjoying what I'm making now so I'm in no rush, or at least I'm trying not to be.

Reading through the posts here and a couple of other subreddits has been incredibly helpful so I thank all of you that have put tips and tricks out there for us newbs to lean on. It has been a lot of fun so far and damn tasty trying out some local roasters, I look forward to experiencing more interesting brews in the future.

This is a sort of random and a bit disjointed collection of notes on different concepts in which Matty has noted interest or influence. I wanted to go into the new record with a deeper understanding of the cultural/social/political framework that it either will reference or at the very least, exist alongside.  I know fans of the music likely already think about this stuff a lot, but I hope this will help fill in gaps or start a discussion. Sorry it's long. My only credentials are that I read a lot and have free time. 


**TLDR: EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING AND NOTHING IS ONE THING**

**Glossary:**

**Postmodernity:** The cultural period beginning in the late 80s/early 90s. Related: “the Post-Modern Condition” describes a time of isolationism – individually, collectively and politically. Marked sometimes as “the end of culture” – it is characterized by a superficiality, depthlessness, and a move away from the autonomous progressivism of the Modern period. (This is inextricably tied to late stage capitalism, as we will get into later) 

**Neoliberalism:** An economic term that, in the U.S. at least, this describes a set of policies introduced after the Depression to (in theory) control the volitility of the free markets. Think of Liberal not in terms of political leanings, but in terms of a liberal approach to regulation – pro-privatization, deregulation, globalism, reduction of government spending – policies designed to increase the role of corporations in the economy and society.

**Moral absolutism:** a belief that all actions are definitively right or wrong, regardless of context or outcome. Or, in the social media age, a belief that a person is either all good or all bad based on isolated, low-context social media posts


**On Late Stage Capitalism and Mental Health and Art**
“What is needed now is a politicization of much more common disorders. *[depression, anxiety]* Indeed, it is their very commonness which is the issue…In his book The Selfish Capitalist, Oliver James has convincingly posited a correlation between rising rates of mental distress and the neoliberal mode of capitalism practiced in countries like Britain, the USA and Australia. In line with James’s claims, I want to argue that it is necessary to reframe the growing problem of stress (and distress) in capitalist societies. **Instead of treating it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their own psychological distress, instead, that is, of accepting the vast privatization of stress that has taken place over the last thirty years, we need to ask: how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are ill?”**
― Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?

Fisher also argues there is a direct line between the economic policies that began in the 70s in the UK and US and a flattening and commercialization of art and culture. Artists, writers, creatives used to be able to work waiting tables or at coffee shops and still have the time, energy and means to create. Now, simply surviving under late stage capitalism has ""gradually and systematically deprived artists of the resources necessary to produce the new.""

What we have now is a nostalgia bent to art, music, culture that either imagines a future that never arrived or is made in homage to a past when that future was possible. He doesn’t necessarily mean overt nostalgia, but rather a reliance on styles/sounds created long ago. Culture and art have been so robbed by tHe EcONoMy that at this point we couldn’t even imagine something totally new, like disco.

Fisher died by suicide at his home in Suffolk, England in January 2017. In his book Ghosts of My Life, he wrote: ""the pandemic of mental anguish that afflicts our time cannot be properly understood, or healed, if viewed as a private problem suffered by damaged individuals."" 

Fisher’s suicide is perhaps one of the clearest examples of the inextricability of all of this. One of the world’s greatest thinkers, able to intellectualize his mental health struggles not as a problem to bootstrap one’s way out of but emblematic of the human condition in capitalist society, was still unable to escape it on this side of the veil. 


**On Social Media:**
The established adage is that when a service is free, you are the product. But more than that, to grow up in the age of social media is to live in a world where your interests are bought and sold before they are even your own. Fisher talks about Kurt Cobain giving voice to a generation who knew “his every move was a cliché scripted in advance, knew that even realising it is a cliché"" and you could even apply Jean Baudrillard's simulation theory to this as well. When existing inside a heavy consumerist culture, are the things you want borne out of your own free will, or has capitalism created a simulation of reality in which you are fed your wants and desires without even realizing?

Matty said on Doom Scroll that social media makes everyone an activist while, in turn, polluting the work of actual activists. The way social media works by giving us immediate attention and dopamine hits, means that it is much more common to perform liberalism without participating in its labor. An Instagram share performs “raising awareness” or virtue signals about how we’d like to be seen – intelligent, engaged – whereas real community organizing requires labor and time and is often thankless and difficult. 


**On moral absolutism and the death of context:**
ART IS NOT MEANT TO BE DIDACTIC, you have to bring your own personal lived experience to its viewing. In the age of moral absolutism where everyone is trying to game out which “side” people are on before they declare themselves a fan, a public lacking context/nuance/complexity expects art to instruct them, reduce the intellectual burden on them, and to have an overt morality.

The ATVB/SATVB tour as part performance art, at least partially, plays to this. It is a house without a fourth wall, giving you a voyeuristic view into a set *constructed* to look like an intimate place. It plays out the parasocial simulation of reality that evolved alongside the social internet response to it.



**Online Religious Fantacism**
Matty's talked about seeing people on instagram clutch their crystals and be mentally unwell online but doing so in community, which metastasizes and legitimizes their delusion as it did for Bob Hickman. There is a direct relationship between this cultural Christanity and an emergence of hyper masculinity that is almost a caricature of itself. The social internet pushed these almost hyperbolic expressions of ""manhood"" to be affirmed in a way tempered personalities and opinions are not, and gave them a place to morph together to become the militant, white, neo-christian masculinity we have today. As Kristin Kobes Du Mez writes in *Jesus and John Wayne*: their messages blended together to become the dominant chord in the cacophony of evangelical popular culture.

The first part of that made me think of this Carl Sagan passage from 1995:
“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance” -Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World, 1995


**On The New Record**
*“So the new record is, I suppose, borne from me nearly going insane, and that being a kind of internet-induced insanity, combined with the cautionary tale of my last record, which is essentially like don’t get red-pilled and black-pilled. Try normal life maxxing.” --Matty Healy on Doom Scroll, 1:43*

(personal opinion) I know he is not writing a response record to TS and The Tortured Poets Department as a relationship rehash or with any “tea”, but I also think it’s impossible to separate his experience with her online fandom and these concepts he’s thinking about. The stripping of context and nuance from a person, the moral absolutism of some online fandoms, the absence of critical thought as that open letter circulated, and the performative online outrage that had real life consequences in individual lives. It has to be a very weird experience to already be academically interested in the way people perform morality online and how a measured, thoughtful opinion doesn’t get engagement, etc, and then personally become the center of the worst parts of that.

I have cleaned it properly 3 times (run the built in program with chemicals that were suggested by the company), now I can't see any residue, just the cleaned water in the pipes.

My problem is that the water is not coming out in the portafilter section even on Espresso/Americano settings, but coming through the hot water wand. I have took the machine apart, the pump is working, the boiler is working too, the pressure seems alright. I have gone in to the test modes and all the functional tests and Load tests were successful except the ""Coffee Hydraulic circuit"". I think it was failing because water should come out from the portafilter in that case. Though, the leds was flashing correctly each time.

There is a water splitter part above the portafilter section, which will let the water go through the portafilter section, or in the hot water section. It does not have any electronics connected to it, only the 3 water pipes (one in, one for the pressure sensor, and one goes up, to the wand. Automatically water should go down, to the portafilter section which it is connected to.). I don't know if that part is failing (it looks too simple) or something else.

The air was still, thick, and humming faintly—though when I strained to hear, there was nothing. Just silence. The kind that stretches and pulls, like the pause before a scream.

And I *knew.* The way you know it’s raining before you see the drops. The way you know a shadow is watching before you turn your head. The world would end today.

It wasn’t a broadcast. It wasn’t a message carved into the sky. It was something that settled deep in the marrow, undeniable. And from the look in my neighbor’s eyes as she stepped onto her porch, her hands trembling around a cup of coffee, I knew she felt it too.

Across the street, a man stood frozen on his lawn, staring up at the sun. His face was pale, but his eyes weren’t looking *at* the sun. They were looking past it.

By mid-morning, cracks began to appear—not in the earth, but in reality.

In the park, the air shimmered like heat waves, and a sound emerged, distant but vast, like metal grinding against bone. Birds fell from the sky, spiraling to the ground in eerie, silent spirals, their eyes gone.

On my walk to the diner, the shadows seemed to stretch wrong, pulling too far across the pavement, bending angles that didn’t exist. I tried not to look directly at them; something in my brain rebelled against the shapes.

Inside the diner, Lucy was there, pouring coffee into mugs with trembling hands. “You feel it, don’t you?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Yeah,” I said, staring at the black liquid swirling in my cup. “Do you know what it is?”

She shook her head, her gaze darting to the window. Outside, the sky had taken on a faint green tint. The sun seemed dimmer, though no clouds obscured it.

“It’s older than us,” she said, her voice hollow. “It doesn’t care about us. We’re just... in the way.”

By the afternoon, the humming in the air grew louder. It wasn’t a sound you could hear with your ears. It was deeper, resonating in the chest, vibrating the teeth. People on the streets clutched their heads, some screaming, others whispering nonsense to no one.

A child stood in the middle of the road, pointing at the horizon. “They’re here,” she said, though there was nothing there.

I looked anyway. For a moment, I thought I saw a figure—a towering shape that wasn’t a shape at all, something too vast to fit in my mind. My eyes watered, and I looked away. But the image burned behind my eyelids, writhing and twisting.

By nightfall, the world had begun to unravel.

The stars didn’t come out. Instead, the sky was filled with an endless, churning void that seemed to stretch closer with every passing second. The humming had become a roar, a cacophony of voices speaking in languages that weren’t meant for human ears.

People fell to their knees, clutching at their chests, their mouths agape in silent screams. Some began to walk toward the horizon, their faces blank.

The last thing I saw before the world ended was Lucy. She sat across from me in the diner, her eyes fixed on the void outside. Her lips moved, forming words I couldn’t hear.

The sky folded in on itself, and with it, everything else.

There was no explosion. No fire. Just the unbearable realization that we had never been alone, and that whatever was out there had finally noticed us.

It's like every gay knows eachother and is out to get me or something 😭. So here's my 2024 story of me almost going insane. These are just the guys I talked for a lot longer. 

(Sorry, I know this is a lot of reading)

Guy1: Started messaging me in the beginning of 2024. I already have history with him where he has ghosted me lol, but I thought we could make it work again... he ghosted me again :)

Guy 2: Started messaging me around March and was just looking for someone to play Fortnite/GTA5 with but we soon started falling for eachother. We talked for months but had a difficult experience trying to meet up and make it official. We don't live close to eachother, but also not that far (abouf 1-2hours by car)He did eventually ghosted me too.

Guy 2 (continued): After ghosting me he started posting another guy on his Instagram story. That lasted about a week, and he moved on to Guy 3. This guy lives 1 km away from me which I found a bit strange at first. Then I remembered Guy 3 and Guy 1 used to date a few years back. So now all of those we're kinda connected in a way (The Gay Matrix🤭). I thought I was happy for number 2 and 3, but I was really jealous lol.

Guy 3: So a few weeks had passed and I downloaded the evil yellow app to try and get over him. Then Guy 3 saw my profile and Tapped me almost immediately. I checked Instagram and saw 2 and 3 removed eachother from Instagram. I tapped 3 back but then realized that was a mistake and deleted grindr again lol.

Guy 2: Contacted me again and wanted to know if we can play Fortnite again. I don't know why I agreed, but I did. The feelings for him game back and we even played other games every other day, but then he dissappeared again. A few weeks passed and I saw he posted he has a new boyfriend, but this time I was really over him for good. I did spend some time away from men, made some gay friends but nothing relationshipy.

Guy 4: He is a sweetheart. We met in Uni (2022) I was just glad to be his friend, eventhough we only texted and he had a boyfriend at the time. We did stop talking but not for any bad reason. I guess we just got busy with our own friends/lives. So last year he messaged me around Christmas time, and since then we started talking almost everyday. The happy to be his friend part died and I fell for him HAHA. Im guessing he likes me too like he asked me if I wanted to meet up and grab a coffee or something. We also talk about going on cute dates like having movie nights and stuff. 

Now that I have my eyes (finally on a sweet person) the Gay Matrix is in chaos and keeps throwing guys on my path trying to chat. The recent one messaged me on Instagram and immediately started talking like we are close friends or something, like how does he know all this stuff about me and what to say and whatever. There have been minor characters in this story, like this one guy who talks to me dissappears for months, says something random to talk about, then dissappears again. 

Should I just delete social media or what, cause that's primarily where the Matrix is from.

My definition of The Gay Matrix: Its this cycle and repetition of the same patterns over and over. It's constant ghosting and crawling back that makes you feel like shit. You feel like shit because they keep ghosting you, but then you can't truly get over this feeling because they crawl back just to do it again. they are also almost always connected (directly or indirectly) which makes you think is those whole thing just a joke or not

So red or blue pill, how do I finally escape the Gay Matrix.",1,1737568174.0,askgaybros,0,0.67,False

Call me Airus! I'm ancient and in my early (okay, maybe mid) thirties. I'm looking for long-term writing partners who want to get absolutely lost in a world of our own. I veer towards at least 4-5 paragraphs for posts, so I guess you could consider that lazy lit? Possibly novella? We don't need to put labels on it, as I tend to mirror my partner over time and I will *always* give you something to work with. I’m a sucker for detail, may enjoy tiny inner character monologues a little too much, and will die for witty banter.  
  
Catch me on EST timezone. My schedule is fairly weird. I’m a super early riser, so you may get some activity from me in the wee hours of the morning. I also get a break midday and work fairly late, so I’ll be whooshing in and out of discord throughout the day. (I don't do Gaia PMs or threads btw. I reply fastest through Discord)  
  
➥ Let's talk reply speed. Mine is totally conditional. I am most active on the weekends and if there is a time to expect a reply, it’ll be on those days. However, it also depends on what’s going on at work. If my schedule is lax, I may be able to squeeze out a reply or two on the weekdays too! I am very patient and will literally wait forever for my partner as long as we're communicating!

❀ I would love to write with someone who gravitates towards strong, dynamic characters. I don’t want to save your character, and I definitely don’t want yours to save mine. (At least not as a major plot point or main, overarching theme)  
❀ Let’s conjure up fun banter between two individuals that can hold their own and equally contribute to the plot.  
  
  
➥ **Yes Please?:**   
❀ Writing is a creative vulnerability for me. With that said, I get super invested in my characters, my partner’s characters, and my partner. Free time is a luxury in my world. With that said, I will respect yours, and I would hope you’d do the same for me!   
  
❀ I am extremely patient when it comes to posting speed. I’m happy as a clam just talking/plotting/gushing about our story regularly even if it means we are taking our time actually writing.

I’m just starting out in the world of coffee, and I could really use your advice, feedback, or even constructive criticism. I’ve always loved the smell and taste of coffee (way better than chai for me!), but up until now, I’ve only had instant milk coffee.

Recently, I decided to try actual specialty coffee, and I’ve ordered a few things to begin with. Here’s what I’ve got and my reasoning behind the choices:

1. **Timemore French Press** – I live in a dorm, so I didn’t want to spend too much but still wanted something durable, portable, and good-looking. The Timemore French Press seemed like a good choice since it doesn’t have a handle (easier to pack in luggage for holidays or travel). I looked into options like the Aeropress, but ₹3,000+ felt a bit much for someone just starting out and who only plans to make 1-2 cups every couple of days. I also considered the Kaldipress, but I’d rather avoid a cheaper alternative to a product and any potential BPA concerns.
2. **Coffee Beans** – I’ve ordered a few pre-ground sample packs from Blue Tokai. I thought about getting a grinder, but most of them are expensive. Would a cheap hand grinder (under ₹2,000) be worth it? Or is it better to stick with pre-ground coffee that I can finish within 13-14 days of roasting?

I’m planning to follow Hoffmann’s technique for the French Press, but I’m open to other brewing suggestions or tweaks to improve my experience.

I’d love any advice or feedback you have, whether about my gear choices, brewing tips, or general beginner coffee wisdom. Thanks in advance for helping me on my coffee journey! 😊

Blake and Ryan (Blyan?) apparently fully unaware that cameras capture both images AND sound, were not pleased. So much so that they have asked the judge to tape Freedmans' mouth shut. I mean, how very dare he!

At the center of this new lawsuit is a New York Times article bluntly entitled ""\*We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine"" (\*yes, that is the title of the article). In the suit Baldoni states ""The *Times* story relied almost entirely on Lively’s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives.”

Sunday afternoon, as I was writing the post about journaling, my phone rang. It was a colleague I'd worked with around the turn of the millennium (let's call him George). We worked at a web agency, I as a programmer and he as a sysadmin. This web agency was small (maybe 20 people) and most of us were young: early-to-mid twenties. We had fun at work and there were many friendships that formed there.

George was one of those colleagues that became a friend. We both like video games and tech, he's kind and low-key funny in a nerdy way. Very reflecting too. As our careers took us in different directions we only sporadically kept in touch. We had seen each other at a couple lunches over the decades, 

Two years ago, I was down in Stockholm for work. I stayed at a friend's, and that friend lived close to where the offices of F were. This got me thinking about my former colleagues and I sent a text to George to see if he wanted to catch up.

He called me yesterday to say that text changed his life.

It's a long story, and I'll try to keep it brief.

When we caught up I learned that he loves nature (we bonded over our dogs), hiking and likes to photograph. He was still the kind guy I remembered, so I offered him to use our guest house if he wanted, since we live in hiking paradise. His vacation was in July, when we were going to the US, and he was coming with a friend – but he was the kind of kind guy you trusted not to bring anyone I wouldn't welcome (the friend was indeed a great guy).

When he was going home after two weeks, he had plans to drive on to Lofoten (I'm sure he had at least 6 weeks of vacation at the job he had) but decided to drive home.

The drive from us to Stockholm is 14-15 hours with breaks, so he split it in two. He overnighted in a mid-sized town six hours north of Stockholm where he lived at the time. He remembered an old friend from IRC (the OG Discord, huge in the 90s) had moved there with her husband and kids. They had coffee and cought up.

She was divorced now, and her talking about how bad her marriage had been towards the end made George realize that he had to end his current relationship. He had been thinking about it for a couple years, but the inertia of convenience had kept him still.

He goes home, breaks up, moves out. And now that he has momentum, he quits his (very well paid, I presume, since he's good with cybersecurity) job, and starts his own consulting business. He moved to a smaller town. A year had passed since then, and his business is doing great.

As a cherry on top, George and the friend he caught up with found each other and are now in a relationship. 

That was a nice phone call to get.

Should I address it or move on?,"I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for 9 years, and we’ve always had a pretty easy relationship. But this morning, something happened that has really shaken me, and now I’m wondering if I’m overreacting or if I should confront him.

It all started because he has this habit of rushing around in the mornings, asking me to help with little things like making his coffee or packing his lunch while he gets ready. I don’t mind doing it now and then, but I also work full-time and need to get ready myself.

This morning, we both needed to shower at the same time, so I let him go first. When I needed to brush my teeth, he was still in the bathroom, so I decided to finish making his breakfast and brew him some tea while I waited.

When he came out and sat down to eat, he asked me to pack his lunch. At that point, I was already feeling a bit frustrated, so I snapped, “Why can’t you do it? I still need to get ready!” That’s when he got upset and told me, “Stop complaining. I don’t need to hear this right now.”

I tried to explain that I was getting overwhelmed because I had asked him to make a grocery list the day before, and he hadn’t done it. I work longer hours than he does, and I wanted him to help with things like that since he has more free time after work.

He completely flipped out, saying I was ruining his morning on purpose and making him late for work. And then, just when I thought things couldn’t get worse, he told me, “You’re going to be a terrible mom.” He said I should just suck it up and do things without complaining, especially in the mornings, because it was affecting his day.

That comment hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn’t expect him to say something like that, and now I can’t stop thinking about it. I never meant to ruin his morning—I just wanted to express how I was feeling. But now, I’m questioning everything. I feel hurt, and I don’t know if I should confront him about it or just let it go.

I feel like I’m stuck in this weird place where I’m blaming myself for being upset, but at the same time, I can’t ignore how much that comment stung. Should I talk to him about it, or am I just being too sensitive?

1i7gpsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1i7gpsg/does_this_sound_like_my_gallbladder/,Does this sound like my gallbladder?,"Hey all, I need to know if anyone has gotten their gallbladder removed because of symptoms similar to mine. Sorry in advance this is long.

Here's my story:
for the last 5 years, maybe more, I have had frequent diarrhea. Could not figure out why. Stopped eating dairy, it still happened. Tried avoiding specific foods, it still happened. Tried going gluten free, it still happened. Stopped drinking coffee. Every single morning I would have to rush to the bathroom, and it would be worse if I ate a traditional American breakfast (eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon). It would also be worse if I had a lot of caffeine. 

Fast forward to six months ago, after breakfast I have a sharp pain in my abdomen, I double over for about 10 seconds, and go to the bathroom hoping that will fix it. After that, I started feeling nauseous and lightheaded. My stomach hurt so bad and I couldn't focus. I ended up going to an urgent care, where they said I needed to go to the ER because I was showing signs of appendicitis. This is my worst fear, so I went, and they did a CT scan. By the time they did the CT scan however, I was starting to feel better. They found nothing concerning, but said my gallbladder had a few small stones. They suspected it was inflamed and that I had a gallbladder attack, but since it had passed it was kind of a guess. They told me to start a low fat diet and make an appointment with a surgeon. 

I was afraid, and in denial, so I didn't change my diet much immediately. I also didn't make the app with the surgeon, because surely I can fix this without surgery. I'm only 25, and I just need to eat healthier. 

As the days pass I get increasingly more nauseous, and my stomach burns every time I eat. 5 days after the first incident, I eat lunch (a salad, with a crazy amount of dressing and goat cheese and nuts) and my chest starts burning so badly I think I'm having a heart attack. I go to the ER again, they do a chest X-ray and after finding out I'm not having a heart attack, they do a GB ultrasound to make sure I don't have a stone stuck. No stone stuck, and they confirm I have stones, but no other concerning signs. They send me home and tell me to buy some pepcid. 

For the next 6 months, I cycle through ppis, land on prescription strength Omeprazole, but it doesn't completely work. Just eliminated the constant nausea and feeling of lump in my throat. 

I then saw the surgeon, who told me he would do the surgery based on my symptoms but he's not too concerned. I decided I would wait and see if this would go away or not first. I saw a GI, did a HIDA scan without CCK which came back normal. Did an EGD which came back only showing gastritis. GI also refuses to order a HIDA scan With CCK because he is afraid a stone will get stuck because of it. This frustrated me bc I suspect my gallbladder isn't functioning properly.

I was on an extremely low fat diet for a while, I rapidly lost 20lbs and have not been able to gain it back. (I am 5'5 and was 115lbs before this started.) Every time I ate something with more than 5g of fat my stomach would burn so badly that I needed a heating pad and painkillers so I could function. Recently I said screw it and started adding more fat into my diet so I could try to gain the weight back. It's barely working, and I'm constantly uncomfortable, but not quite in the same amount of pain as before. Every morning I have painful stomach cramps, but going to the bathroom relieves them. This never used to happen before, even with the diarrhea it would never hurt like this. 

The pain is weirdly mostly on the left side of my abdomen, right below my ribs. But I also feel it on the right side, and I can actually feel pressure there, like there's a blown up balloon. Occasionally I will feel pain behind my ribs on the right side, and that is usually accompanied with stabbing pains when I take a deep breath, like I have a cramp there. I can feel the pain in my back as well. The worst part is the nausea. I am so hungry, but the second I eat something I feel nauseous. I can't finish my food most of the time, and sometimes it even hurts to swallow. Just thinking about eating some of my favorite foods makes me nauseous.

In general I felt less pain when there was very little fat in my diet, but I was becoming so malnourished I couldn't justify it anymore. I feel sick every day. I lost all of my muscle. 

My PCP wants to check my thyroid just bc of the weight loss. My GI wants to do a colonoscopy, even though there was nothing on the endoscopy. Nobody will tell me to get GB surgery, I'm assuming because they don't want to get the blame if my symptoms don't go away after it. They also won't tell me Not to have surgery. They all want me to decide for myself. SO confusing. I'm not a doctor, how should I know? 

Everyone else in my life seems to think there's something I haven't tried yet. My mom thinks my diet isn't strict enough. Family friends have told me to try cleanses/supplements. My boss thinks this is all some weird physical manifestation of stress, and there's nothing actually wrong with me. 

I have another appointment with a surgeon soon, and I want to try to convince my GI to give me the HIDA with CCK. If this thing is causing all my problems I want it out NOW. There doesn't seem to be any signs of anything else being wrong with me, I don't know what else to do. 

I just need to know if there are others out there, who had symptoms like mine and removing their gallbladder helped them. Not to be dramatic but this is already ruining my life, and I know it can get so much worse. ",1,1737567259.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I dont do anything requiring advanced medical knowledge. A nurse comes by the house twice a week to help with that sort of stuff. I have zero medical training other than a CPR course I took a few months ago in case of an emergency, but something tells me that I am already forgetting the basics with each passing day.

I dont mind taking care of her. My grandma took me in when I was 11 years old after my father and mother split. Neither of them really wanted a child. 

That was evident from the beginning. I think my mother loved me, but she was never fit to raise a kid, and she knew it. My father, on the other hand, was never fit to be around children, let alone take care of one himself. He was always in and out of jail.

Before my grandmother took me in, my fondest childhood memories were when my dad was doing time. Things weren't so bad when it was just my mother and me. But whenever he returned from his imprisonment, things would always end up falling apart again. When my parents finally did divorce, I was about as dejected as a child could be. The bright beam of childhood innocence had long since faded from my eyes.

That all changed when I went to live with my grandma. Her house was clean and big and had an acre of land. I had a room to myself and more than two changes of clothes. I thought we must have been rich.

Raising me increased her financial burden, but she never let it show on her face. That woman always had a smile on. I wish that smile would come back. Ever since the disease started taking a firm hold on her, she mostly just stares. 

She allows me to take care of her on the good days, and we spend quality time enjoying novels and her black-and-white TV shows. On the bad days, she won't let me help at all. I dont quite understand what sets her off, but some days she wakes up paranoid and scared.

**Day 1: Sunday**

My alarm went off at 5:55 AM. What the hell? I thought. I always set my alarm for 9:00 AM. Although many old people enjoy waking up earlier than the sun, my grandma will sleep all day if I let her. I usually start my day at 9:00, get myself ready, make breakfast, and then get grandma out of bed around 10:00.

So why was my alarm going off at 5:55? I turned it off and rolled over, trying to fall back asleep. But before I could, I heard a crash from upstairs. I live in the basement, and Grandma lives in the master bedroom on the main floor. I rushed out of my room and up the stairs as quickly as possible.

Was Grandma hurt? Did she fall? What was she doing out of bed? My mind was racing. When I reached the top of the stairs, I expected to see my grandmother somewhere on the floor, but instead, I saw an empty living room. 

The sun hadn't come up yet, making the room barely visible. I peered into the master bedroom and found Grandma still fast asleep. I closed the door slowly, trying not to wake her. With Grandma safe in her room, I decided to check the house to see if I could locate the source of the crashing sound. The kitchen looked normal, except for a knife in the sink, which I was pretty sure I had cleaned and put away the night before.

Next, I checked the living room and found a book on the floor. I keep the house pretty tidy so that Grandma doesn't trip over anything, so it was definitely odd to find the book in the middle of the room. I picked it up and opened it. It was a scrapbook. One of the many my grandmother had put together over the years. 

This one mainly consisted of photos of my mother when she was young. Closing the book, I walked a few feet to the bookshelf and returned it, where dust had revealed its usual resting place.

I still felt a little groggy, and with my tired mind, I rationalized that my grandma had been looking at it earlier and left it on the floor without me realizing it. That's the thing about the human mind. We will do anything to rationalize the unexplainable.

Remembering it was still early and I had about 3 hours before I needed to get on with my day, I snuck out of the house for a quick run. I don’t typically leave my grandmother unattended, but she wouldn't wake up for a while, and it was nice to get some time to myself. I returned to the house half an hour later.

Stepping into the bathroom, I got a text from my girlfriend, Jane. She works at a bakery and always texts me when she heads off to work, though I usually dont reply for a couple of hours because, like I said before, I'm never up this early. 

The text read, “Good Morning Paul! I'm leaving for work, but maybe I can swing by later and hang out for a bit?”

I smiled and decided I'd surprise her by texting back immediately, “Have fun at work! I love you!”

 “Wow! You're up early!” she replied. 

“Yeah, I got woken up by a loud noise and decided to get a jump start on my day.” I left out the part about my alarm going off 3 hours early.

When it was time to wake up Grandma, I went into her bedroom softly and turned on the light, but to my surprise, Grandma was already awake. She sat at the foot of her bed staring at me, not with her usual blank stare, but a fearful one.

“Hey, Grandma, what's wrong?” I asked.

She didn't reply. She just kept staring at me. I decided to give her some privacy after making sure she was safe. 

I went to the kitchen to make some breakfast. As I glanced into the sink, ready to wash the knife I had forgotten about the night before, it was gone. I figured I was tired when I noticed it earlier and was probably mistaken. 

There is a window above the kitchen sink, which gives a beautiful view of the lawn. As I stared out, a bluebird flew by and rested on the back porch. The beautiful bird looked almost out of place in our little backyard. I had never seen a bird like it in our area.

When I turned around, I almost jumped out of my skin to see my Grandmother an inch from my face.

“Geez, Grandma!” My fear quickly turned to laughter as I chuckled, “Granny, you nearly scared me half to death! Are you feeling any better?” She still had that scared and angry look on her face. It was almost as if… “Hey, grandma…” I said nervously. “You know who I am, right? It's me, Paul. Your grandson.” 

Quietly, she said without taking her eyes off me, “There's someone in the house.”

A feeling of awful guilt spread over me as I told her, “No, Grandma, you know me. I live here with you, remember?” Her anger turned to disappointment. 

She leaned closer to my face and, in a hushed tone, whispered, “No, Paul. I know who you are. I am telling you that there is someone in our house.”

My heart sank, and the guilty pit in my stomach became a sinkhole of fear. “Where?! Grandma, where did you see this person? My God, are they still here?” I instantly believed her, as I always have, but then, for a moment, I thought, Is this the disease? Is she seeing things now? I didn’t remember the doctor saying anything about hallucinations. 

I pushed the thoughts out of my head. I reached for my phone to dial 911, but grandma put her hand on mine before I could unlock it. 

“He's in my room.” She said it almost as if it was an afterthought.

My heart raced, and without thinking, I picked her up and shuffled towards the front door. Once outside, I sat her on the porch bench. “Stay here,” I said. She wasn't looking me in the eyes. 

I rushed back into the house and to her bedroom. The door was shut. I went to reach for the handle, but I stopped. 

Adrenaline had gotten me this far, but it seemed to run dry when it came time to investigate. What would I even do if I found someone in there? I thought. But I needed to make sure that we were safe.

I slowly turned the knob and pushed my way inside. Everything looked normal, other than a bit of clutter. Hadn't I picked up her room the night before? I checked everywhere, but there was no sign of anyone. 

I felt relieved and almost smiled at how worked up I'd been. That feeling soon left me as I remembered the master bathroom with its door still shut. I flung the door open, but what I saw didn't scare me. It was confusing. The walls, the mirror, the floor, all of it. It was all covered in a black sludge. 

The smell reminded me of the many hot summer days I spent walking the empty road as a kid. It was the smell of tar and tobacco. After standing in shock for what must have been minutes, I checked the rest of the house but found nothing.

I walked outside to find Grandma still on the bench. Her attention had turned to a small pile of ants on the concrete. “Hey, Grandma, I checked the house. There's no one there.” She didn't reply. 

“Did something happen in the bathroom? What is all that stuff?” Still no reply. I wasn't totally convinced that there had been an intruder, but I also wasn't totally convinced my Grandma had made the mess herself. 

The rest of the day passed by quickly. Grandma hadn't said a word to me since the incident, but honestly, I didn't really have time for conversation anyway. Cleaning the sludge was nearly impossible. 

It took me well into the afternoon to clear away the black stain. The tar was warm to the touch initially but soon completely dried, making it hard and resistant to my efforts.

I didn't even realize what time it was when I heard a knock at the door. Jane! I ran to the door and opened it to see her face beaming at me. 

“Jane! I am so sorry I forgot you were coming over.” 

She looked disappointed, “Oh, sorry. Do you want me to leave? I should have texted to remind you I was coming.” 

“No! Please come in. I'm sorry. I just feel bad that I haven't showered or made dinner or anything. I've been so busy today. 

“How's Grandma doing?” she asked. 

“It's been a bad day for her today.” She knew what I meant. I had often confided in her about Grandma’s previous “bad days,” she knew from interacting with Grandma how quiet and off she could seem when her mind wasn't at its best. 

“Aw, Granny,” she said, turning a sympathetic face to Grandma. She really did love my grandma.

We ordered Chinese food, and I told Jane about the day's events. “That's so weird!” she said between bites of orange chicken. “Where do you think she got the black stuff?” 

“I dont know. I'm not even 100 percent sure it was her. I mean, who knows, maybe someone was in our house. I did notice a few things out of place.”

We sat silently for a few seconds. We turned our attention to the black and white film we had put on for Grandma, and soon, the night started to feel like any other. When the movie ended, I tucked Grandma into bed. Jane and I turned on a show with actual color and cuddled on the couch.

**Day 2: Monday**

My alarm woke me up at 5:55 AM. I looked at my phone, puzzled that it had happened twice. Before I had time to go back to bed, a loud bang from upstairs startled me. I was on my feet in an instant. 

This sound was much louder than the one the day before. I barreled up the stairs and peered into Grandma’s room. She was asleep. Stepping back into the living room, I found the same scrapbook on the floor.

I started turning on all the lights. Once the room was well-lit, I opened the scrapbook. A sinister feeling crept into my bones as I flipped through page after page. Every picture that included my mother had been ruined, her face cut from each photo. 

I called the police, and the operator said they would be there as soon as possible. I was convinced that there had been someone in the house. While waiting for the police, I woke up Grandma and walked her out to my car, where she sat while I looked the house over. In the 6 minutes it took for the police to arrive, I noticed a drawer open in the kitchen. I also found more black goo in the garage. 

The police walked through the house, checking every place a person could hide. They didn't find anyone and there was no evidence of forced entry. 

“Sounds like someone might be looking to hurt your mom, seeing as her face was cut out of all the pictures.” said the officer. 

“Well, if someone had it out for her, they had the wrong house. We haven't seen her in nearly 17 years.” I replied. The officers offered to check up on us later tonight to make sure there wasn't anyone lurking around the property and said to call again if there were any further disturbances. 

“Thanks, officers,” I said. I ushered Grandma back into the house as they pulled out of the driveway. 

“You alright, Grandma?” I asked. No response. We stepped into the living room, and I was helping her sit on the couch when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I turned to face the kitchen window. That same bluebird from the day before was staring right at me. 

The bird was so beautiful, but looking at it, I couldn't help but feel like I was in some sort of danger. Like a bad omen. It continued to stare for a few moments and then flew away. 

The day dragged on. Grandma hadn't said a word; worse, she hadn't even looked me in the eyes. I was worried.

The sun dipped over the horizon, and suddenly, it was night. Time to put Grandma to bed. As I helped her get comfortable, she looked at me. It was a welcomed surprise, and I smiled at her, but she didn't smile back. 

She only whispered the words, “Someone is in the kitchen.”

Ice went down my spine. “What? Grandma, we were both just in there, and I didn't see anybody.” She looked terrified. Obviously, my words were of no comfort to her. 

She just repeated, “In the kitchen…the kitchen…kitchen.” Then she rolled over, closed her eyes, and stopped speaking. She was really starting to make me worried, and I really couldn't decide whether to believe her or not.

I left the room and headed for the kitchen. Upon arrival, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary right away. Other than the drawer with the bags and wrap. It was open again. I turned to walk out and turned the light off, but the room didn't get dark. 

I flicked the switch on and off, but the room remained illuminated. In fact, it was getting brighter. Panicked, I did the first thing that came to my mind and reached for the big knife in the knife block, but I froze when I noticed the knife block was empty. Sweat washed over me, and I saw all the knives in the sink. 

The room continued to illuminate brighter and brighter as I dashed for a knife and cut myself on one of the smaller blades before finally grabbing hold of the bread knife. My attention briefly turned to my bloody hand as I attempted to wrap a rag around the wound. 

Just then, the room went completely quiet, and I saw it. A large figure, maybe 8 feet tall. The creature was completely naked except for a plastic film - plastic wrap, covering it from head to toe. The light emanating from the figure seemed to give me tunnel vision, blurring my surroundings. I couldn't make out the face, as it was completely masked in the plastic wrapping, but there was a protrusion where the nose was underneath. 

Petrified, I felt my blood run cold. I was so scared that I was physically unable to move. The dread filled me like molasses in a glass, slowing my thoughts. I dropped the knife, which crashed to the tile floor with a metallic clang. 

I wanted to run, but my legs felt like stone. I stared in horror at the bright monster, and just when I thought it might attack, it began to speak.

“Fear not, sweet boy,” its voice sounded frail and weak as if trying to convince me I was safe. It reminded me how an old person might talk to a child, almost mimicking their innocent tone. It continued to speak, “Sweet Paul. Sweet…Paul.” 

“Who are you?” I managed to say in a shaky voice. 

“Sweet Paul, I am your guardian angel. Your guide in the darkness. Your friend from above.” I wasn’t convinced. An angel? This thing looked demonic. It was the stuff of my nightmares. 

“Okay…well, I’m good, actually. I don’t need a guardian angel.” The angel began breathing heavily, and in a much deeper voice than before, it said, 

“Yes, my sweet boy. You do.” Just then, the knives in the sink flew straight up in the air and stuck into the ceiling. The noise startled me, and I turned to see the knives dangling. With my eyes briefly off the creature, I immediately heard footsteps running toward me. 

I screamed and turned back to face the monster. Raising my arms to shield my face, I braced for impact, but…it never came. 

I opened my eyes to a dark, empty room. It was gone, and I was all alone. I quickly flipped on the light and grabbed my phone to call Jane. It went straight to voicemail. 

She must have been asleep. With no one to talk to, I paced around my room until exhaustion took its toll, and I went to bed.

**Day 3: Tuesday**

The next day, my alarm went off at 5:55 AM. This time, I was ready. I bolted up the stairs before any noise alerted me to action, hoping to catch the creature who had been terrorizing us. I started my investigation by checking on Grandma. 

Asleep. Good, I thought as I shut the door and turned my attention to the rest of the house. The first thing I noticed was the scrapbook on the floor, with its pages torn out and strewn across the floor. I needed to clean that up before my grandmother had a chance to see the pitiful state of her treasured photo album, but that would have to wait until I scoured the rest of the house. 

Next, I went to the kitchen. Nothing looked too out of the ordinary, but I noticed that one knife remained stuck to the ceiling while the rest had fallen to the ground. I was about to check the rest of the house when I heard a loud slam coming from the basement. 

The noise was louder than the previous days, and I was sure it had woken Grandma, so I decided to check on her again before investigating. Just as I suspected, Grandma was sitting upright when I walked through the door. She hadn't turned to look at me when I walked in. 

“You okay, Grandma?” I asked. I wasn't expecting a response since she had been nearly mute the past few days. Despite my expectations, she answered immediately. 

“It's okay, Paul. They can't hurt us today. Hank will protect us.” Hank was the name of my grandfather, who had been dead for over 20 years. I didn't have the heart to remind her of his passing, so I said nothing and walked towards the stairs. As I took the first step down, the loud banging noise repeated, sending a chill down my spine. 

I went to take the next step but stood frozen for several seconds. I managed to break through my terror and continue my plunge to the basement. Other than my room, there are two other rooms downstairs. A guest bedroom and a family room which had slowly morphed into my personal mancave over the years. 

The sound happened a third time, and it was clearing coming from the family room. I peeked my head through the door but quickly shot back behind the wall. I had expected to see my not-so-angelic guardian angel, but crouched in the middle of the room was something far worse. 

It was bigger than the angel, maybe 10 feet tall. It had to slouch just to fit in the room. Instead of light, the creature emanated a blinding darkness, which seemed to be battling for space with the soft light of the moon coming through the window. Its hands were disproportionally large for its body, with long bony fingers. 

The most notable characteristic of the monster was what was covering its body. From head to toe, the creature was soaked in hot black sludge, which dripped down to the floor. The chemical smell was overwhelmingly potent, and I found myself struggling not to gag as I sat still and listened to the beast breathe. 

I shifted my weight, preparing to take another look. Before I could peer around the corner, the monster screamed, which sounded like the mix of a man and a dog. I booked it to the staircase, looking behind me, only to watch as the creature tumbled toward me with impressive speed. 

I reached the top of the stairs and almost ran for the front door when I remembered Grandma, who was still in her room. Thinking quickly, I leaped behind the island counter in the middle of the kitchen and hid myself, trying to make as little sound as I could. I heard the tar monster reach the top of the stairs and pause. Thankfully, it didn't know where I was, but soon began searching for me. 

I caught a glimpse of it as its back was turned to me, and I noticed it was carrying something large. Is that…a rug? I thought to myself. Then I recognized it. The thing was carrying my rug from underneath my coffee table. 

What on earth does it want with that? I turned my attention back to my hiding place and scanned for a weapon. As my eyes darted around the kitchen, I became transfixed on the window, or rather what was behind the window. A little blue bird. 

Just then, I heard something crash against the floor, and I spun around. The creature was gone, and my rug lay rolled up in the living room. The rest of the day felt foggy. My head was aching, and no amount of acetaminophen could dull the throbbing. 

Grandma stayed in her room, not letting me in other than to bring her meals and make sure she was taking her medication. By the time night rolled around, I was ready to call it a day, but Jane came over for dinner, and her contagious, unending energy started to rub off on me. 

“So what did you do today? Find any more objects in weird places?” she asked innocently. 

I had almost forgotten that I hadn't told her about the bizarre monsters I'd been seeing. I thought about keeping it to myself, but I could never lie to her. We had been friends since elementary school and together since high school. She was the one person on earth I expected to believe my story. 

So I told her about the Tar Monster and the Plastic Angel from the night before. When I finished, she stared at me with her jaw open. 

“Oh my goodness, Paul…this is just like that show Ghost Adventure or something!” she had a huge smile on her face, which was not the reaction I was expecting. 

“Um…maybe not just like Ghost Adventures, but it is pretty freaky,” I said. 

“We should like set up some cameras and catch them the next time they appear! We could be like famous or something.” she really did seem genuinely excited about the idea. 

“I'd like to see how excited you are when they appear in your kitchen.” I shot back, now smiling myself. 

“It's okay, Paul, I'll stay the night to protect you.” she offered. 

“Dont you work in the morning?” I asked. 

“Nope! We’re closed tomorrow, silly.""

I didn't say it, but I was actually extremely relieved to not have to spend the night alone. I started to get seriously terrified of my own home. “Well, it’s settled then.” I told her, “You can deal with the big evil monsters, and I will get some much-needed beauty sleep.” 

The rest of the night actually felt normal. We watched a horror movie at Jane’s request (what is it with her and this spooky shit?) and went to bed. 

I had this really weird dream that night about my mom. In the dream, I was young, maybe 7 or 8, and was helping her mop the kitchen. She showed me how to fill the bucket with water and how much cleaner to pour in. She handed me the mop and said, “Give it a try!”

I was so eager to help I nearly tripped over the mop as I swished it from side to side. We were cleaning up something wet, and I figured maybe I had spilled some grape soda again. “And then you dip it into the water again,” she told me. I plunged the mop into the bucket and was about to pull it back out when I saw the water turn a light red color. 

Confused, I looked at the ground I had just mopped and was horrified to see that the liquid I had been smearing around the tile was a thick, shimmering pool of blood. I screamed and looked up at my mother for her to comfort me, but I stumbled backward over the bucket when I saw her. As I lay soaked in soap, water, and blood, I watched my mom stare at me with the biggest smile. Her head was bleeding. 

I shot up in bed, free from the nightmare. I must have been gasping for air because Jane sat up as well and started rubbing my back. 

“Hey, hey! What's the matter?” she asked. 

Catching my breath, I started to laugh a bit as I said, “I just had the weirdest, most morbid dream of my life. I was a kid, and my mom was letting me help with chores, but she was bleeding everywhere, and I think that she was going to die.” 

Jane continued to comfort me, and said, “That is weird. Your mom is fine though right? I mean as far as we know?” 

To be honest, I wasn't sure how my mom was doing. The last time I saw her was just before she went to rehab when I was 8. From that time forward, I only communicated with her through letters. When I was 13, the letters stopped. “I'm sure she’s okay,” I said, more to reassure myself than Jane. 

We went back to sleep, and I didn't have any more dreams that night. 

**Day 4: Wednesday**

My alarm woke Jane and me up at 5:55 AM. 

“Why did you set the alarm so early?” she asked, pulling a pillow over her ears. 

I turned off the alarm. “I didn't set it. It's just been doing that. There should be a loud sound, kind of like banging, in a minute or two.” We sat in complete silence, waiting for something to happen. 

About 10 minutes passed, and I started to feel relieved. “Maybe nothing will happen today,” I said. Moments later, we heard a scream coming from upstairs. 

“Granny!” Jane shouted as the two of us sprang into action. I stumbled on the stairs but recovered quickly as I bear-crawled the rest of my way up with tremendous speed. When I reached Grandma’s door, Jane was close behind me. I burst through the door and looked side to side for my grandmother. 

She was gone. I ran to her bed and checked underneath, but there was nothing. We searched everywhere: the closet, the bathroom, the kitchen. Everywhere. She had just vanished. 

“Call the police, I'm gonna drive around the neighborhood in case she left the house!” I shouted.

Jane began dialing 911, and I heard her give the operator the address as I left the house. 

I spent the next 15 minutes driving up and down the roads close to home, but there was no sign of my grandma. Jane texted me that the police had arrived, and I returned to the house. The police re-checked the house and talked to someone on their radio about having all officers on the lookout for a wandering and confused elderly woman. 

I explained to them that her scream sounded frightened and that I thought she might have been taken. They listened to me explain as much as I could without making me sound crazy, and when I had finished my story, they told me the most likely scenario was that she had left the house on her own. I didn't try to argue. I knew how my story must have sounded, and there was nothing I could say to get them to believe me. 

On top of that, I wanted them to be correct. If Grandma were out on her own, as dangerous as that would be, it would be better than being taken. The officers left the house to search for Grandma. While they drove away, I held Jane, who was sobbing into my shirt. 

The rest of the day, Jane and I drove around town looking for her. When we would get tired of driving we would go back to the house and search there again. We repeated this cycle until it started to get dark and we decided to try again the next day and allow the police to do their jobs. 

We remained in contact with them throughout the day, but they turned up nothing. I was devastated, and I felt like crying, but I had held back the tears all day. I was not afraid to cry in front of Jane, but I felt like I needed all my energy to go toward finding Grandma. I couldn't waste any time crying. 

While at home Jane passed out on the couch, exhausted from the emotionally taxing day. I stayed up on my computer creating a flyer to put up around town the next day. I kept my phone ringer on so I would get all updates from the police. Eventually, I started to drift off while sitting upright on my chair. 

I felt the world getting fuzzy as my eyelids slowly fell, fluttering back open a few times and falling again. I was seconds away from total unconsciousness when I heard a voice whisper, 

“You don’t remember, do you sweet boy?” 

I jolted awake to find the Plastic Angel peering its head from behind the sofa that Jane was sleeping on. Its long fingers wrapped around the back of the couch. “J….Jane…” I managed to squeak out. 

“Jane wake up!” She didn't move. I knew she was a deep sleeper but come on Jane! “You need to remember.” The Angel's voice was shrill, like nails on a chalkboard. 

“Remember what?” I asked. 

“You need to remember Paul. You were young. Your mind was easily molded. But it was not the truth.” 

The Angel began inching toward me as it continued. “You need to see what you were forced to forget.” When the Angel had reached my chair, it slowly lifted its pointer finger which began to glow brighter than any light I had ever seen. The finger landed on my forehead, and I fell into a deep sleep. 

**17 Years Ago**

When I was 8, my parents fought a lot. One summer, when my father finished his 3rd stint in prison, he returned home to find that my mother was not conducting their finances the way she had before he went away. She spent more money on groceries and less on pills. She bought me new shoes and even took me to the movies once. 

This caused them to fight to no end. Whenever they would argue, I would sit outside our mobile home on a concrete slab and wait for it to be over. One day, I sat out in the sweltering sun and played with a group of ants that found a small splash of grape soda I had spilled. I let them crawl on my fingers and then back to the hot ground. 

The air was wet, making it hard to swallow. The yelling from inside became unbearably loud, so I stood up and began walking. I didn't know where I was walking to. I just wanted to be somewhere safe. 

After about a half mile of wandering aimlessly, I saw a girl sitting on a tire swing, that hung from a solitary tree. I tried not to make eye contact because I was 8 and girls were icky. 

As I was walking past, she called out to me, “Hey, kid!” 

Shocked, I turned to see her with a warm smile on her face from ear to ear. 

“Hi,” I replied sheepishly. 

“Could you push me? I'm not very good at pumping my legs.” 

I felt a little weird about it, but I didn't really have anything else to do. I decided to comply since pushing a girl on a swing seemed more interesting than walking. 

“What's your name?” she asked. 

“Paul,” I said, warming up to her more and more by the minute. “What's your name?” I asked. 

“Jane.” she said matter of factly. We played for around an hour, and I decided it was probably time to head back home. My parents didn't like when I was gone for long. After that day, every time my parents would fight, I'd walk over to Jane’s house, and we’d push each other on the old tireswing. 

On one particularly rainy day, my parents began to get into another one of their heated arguments. I put on my rain boots and was about to go to my room to get my coat in hopes I could meet up with Jane. Maybe we could find some big puddles to splash in, I thought. 

As I trodded over to my bedroom, I heard my mother scream. It wasn't a scream out of anger (that wouldn't have been novel enough to catch my attention). It was a scream of pain. 

I ran into the kitchen, where I saw my mother holding her face, which was quickly turning a dark color. My father was standing over her with rage in his eyes. Fear held me in its grasp. 

I wanted to turn, to run! But the fear held me in place, staring at the violent scene before me. Wide eyes filling with tears, I looked at my mother, then at my father, and back at my mother. 

My dad looked at me and shouted, “You see, Paul! This is what happens when you step out of line!”

I was paralyzed. I wanted to help my mother. I wanted to tell her that everything would be okay. I wanted to hurt my father for hurting her. 

But most of all, I wanted to scream! I wanted to scream so badly, but I couldn't. All that came out was a sob. My crying only made my father angrier. 

He took a step towards me, but my mother shot up off the ground like lightning and lashed at him, screaming, “Stay away from him, you monster!”

My dad shoved her off and went to hit her again, but my lungs finally released the death grip they had held on my oxygen, and I screamed, “Stop it!” This caught him off guard, and as he turned to face me, my mother jumped to her feet once more and rushed to the knife block, pulling out the biggest one. 

Before she had a chance to use it, my father grabbed her from behind and threw her down. Her head slammed the counter on her way to the floor. With a thud, she landed on the ground. She lay motionless as a pool of blood formed around her. 

“Oh shit!” my dad yelled. He started grabbing at her head in a feeble attempt to stop the bleeding. “No, no, no, no…” his voice trailed off. As I watched this unfold, my vision became blurry, and my peripheral vision began fading out, locking my gaze on the crimson stream flooding from my mother’s skull. We sat in silence. 

Minutes passed, then an hour. I didn't dare say a word. I couldn't. There was nothing in my 8-year-old mind that could understand what had happened. My mother never woke up. 

When my father finally composed himself, he stood up off the ground and began rummaging through drawers in the kitchen. After a minute of searching, he found what he was looking for. He dropped to his knees next to my mother with a package of plastic wrap in his hands. He lifted her head a few inches and carefully wrapped the plastic around her head. 

He was thorough, making sure the blood couldn't continue to drip from her wound. Once he was satisfied with his patch-up job, my mother looked like a shiny manikin. He laid her head back down and left the room, returning a moment later with the rug from under our coffee table. He wrapped her tightly. 

He snapped at me to grab the mop, and soon I was cleaning the kitchen floor. I had to stand up to avoid him as he dragged my mother out of the kitchen and through the front door. He latched the deadbolt behind him, and a moment later, I heard the ignition of his truck. Peering out the window, I watched him drive away. 

He didn't come back for several hours. The whole time he was gone, I stayed in my corner of the kitchen, curled into a ball. The evening turned to night. Eventually, I fell asleep on the kitchen tile. 

I awoke when he returned, walking in slowly. I looked at the digital clock on the stove. 5:55 AM. He was sweaty and tired and wore a look of sadness on his face. 

He took a shower, got dressed, and then called me into the living room. I did as I was told and shuffled my little feet until I found myself sitting on the couch next to the man who had raised me. He was quiet for a while and seemed to be lost in thought. 

He looked at me and said, “Pauly, you know mommy had to go away for a little bit, right?” I looked at him, confused. He continued, “Mom has been fighting some tough battles these past few months. She used a lot of drugs. You know she uses drugs, dont you?” I nodded. 

I had seen her on many occasions, high as she would lay in bed for what seemed like days. I said nothing as he thought for a minute before telling me, “Mom had to go somewhere to get help. A rehab center. It's kind of like a hospital.” The more he spoke, the less I understood. 

“But she was bleeding! Where did you take her?” I felt more lost than I had ever felt. 

“No, Paul,” he said sternly. “She wasn't bleeding.” 

“But, but you-” I stammered. 

“No! Paul, no!” he shouted. “Mom is fine. She just had to go away for a while.” he sounded really frustrated. “She had to go away,” he reiterated. “So when someone asks you where your mom is, what do you tell them?” He was looking me right in the eyes now. 

“I..” I thought for a minute. “I..tell them she had to go away for a while.” 

“Yes! Yes, Paul, that's right!” he buried my face in his chest as he forced an embrace. “That's right, son. Mom just had to go away for a little while, and that's all we know.” When he left the room, I sat there a little longer before standing shakily to my feet and walking out the front door. 

I sat on the wet concrete slap, unsure if I should cry. I was so confused. I really wasn't sure what had happened, but I wanted to believe my father. If he were telling the truth, then Mom would be okay. The rain had stopped, but the clouds still loomed overhead. 

Just then, I heard a quiet tap on the concrete beside me. I turned my head to see the most beautiful blue bird. 

I awoke drenched in sweat. I was in the living room chair where I had been before the Angel had touched me. Jane was still curled up on the couch. I pulled out my phone and checked the time. It was 5:50 AM.

**Day 5: Thursday**

When my alarm went off at 5:55 AM, I silenced it and woke Jane up. “What's going on?” she asked, rubbing her eyes. 

“We have to hide. This is when it always happens.” Confused but terrified, she sat up and began looking around. “Where should we hide?” she was starting to sound panicked, and I wanted to comfort her, but to be honest, I was scared shitless. 

“The pantry!” I exclaimed, pointing towards the kitchen. We scrambled to the door and hid inside just before a booming sound stopped us in our tracks. 

Just as we closed the door we heard a bloodcurling roar coming from the basement. We held each other tightly, neither of us daring to breathe too loudly. Pounding. Footsteps pounded up the stairs as the hate-filled roars continued. 

Through the slits in the pantry door, I could see a large black personage launch itself from the top step into the living room, black sludge spilling onto all surfaces as it frantically searched around the room. It carried my rolled-up rug from the basement. This time it looked a little thicker. The creature slammed the rug onto the floor of the living room and with a scream it fled down the stairs on all fours. 

After a few moments, we ventured outside the pantry. We couldn't hear the monster anymore, and we panted back the oxygen we had lost while holding our breath. Frantically I ran to the living room. I needed to see what was inside that rug. 

Something in my gut told me it would be the decayed body of my mother. But when I opened it up, she wasn't inside. Instead was my sweet grandma, still and cold. I let out a sob. 

Tears streamed from my face and I began performing CPR. 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. I remembered. But it wasn't enough. My grandmother, the woman who had raised me most of my life, the only caretaker who ever gave me any sense of stability, lay dead on the floor of our living room.

At the funeral a few days later Jane held me as we cried together. I was a mess. I had never felt the sting of death quite like this before. 

I had been to funerals before, and they were sad. But this was different. Death didn't just take a life from me, it took my whole heart. Could I really say that death took my grandmother? 

Sure, death might have been waiting in the wings, but what took her was my past. If I had remembered what my father had done to my mother sooner, would all of this have been bypassed? Did it take the loss of my dear matriarch to deliver the truth? These are questions that I dont think will ever be graced with answers. 

Everything ended the night my grandmother was taken from me.

As they readied the casket to be lowered, a small blue bird perched near the head of the grave. It seemed to bow its head in reverence. 

Walking back to our car, Jane broke the silence, “I haven't smoked in years, but I think I'll need a cigarette today. You want one?” She pulled out a pack that I didn't even know she bought. 

“No thanks,” I replied. “My dad used to smoke 2 packs a day.”",1,1737566817.0,creepcast,0,0.57,False

Offices today are becoming less about *work* and more about *vibes*—where innovation meets comfort, and coffee breaks feel like mini spa retreats. Here’s a quick rundown of how office design is changing and why your workspace might soon be cooler than your living room.

# Hybrid Work = Hybrid Spaces

With everyone working half at home and half in the office (or half at the coffee shop), workspaces have had to get creative.

* **Hot Desks, Hotter Ideas**: No more fighting over *your* desk—it’s all shared now, and it’s somehow always next to the snack station.
* **Collab Corners**: Think bean bags, whiteboards, and enough charging ports to power a small city.
* **Tech That Works**: Meeting rooms so smart they could probably run the meeting for you.

# Wellness Takes the Wheel

Turns out, happy employees do better work (who knew?), so offices are becoming wellness havens.

* **Move It or Lose It**: Standing desks and treadmill stations keep you moving while you pretend to listen on Zoom.
* **Zen Zones**: Quiet spaces to escape the noise and recharge—whether it’s for meditating or sneaking a nap.
* **Healthy Air, Happy Life**: Plants everywhere because they’re pretty *and* they help you breathe better.

# Sustainability, But Make It Stylish

Green is the new black, and sustainable offices are all the rage.

* **Furniture With a Story**: Desks made from recycled wood and chairs that used to be... something else.
* **Energy-Saving Magic**: LED lights, solar panels, and HVAC systems so efficient they deserve a medal.
* **Living Walls**: Yes, those vertical gardens are still here, and they’re looking greener than ever.

# Home Sweet Office

Why leave the cozy vibes of home? Bring them to the office instead.

* **Couches Over Cubicles**: Lounge areas so comfy you’ll forget you’re at work—until your boss finds you.
* **Mood Lighting**: Warm, inviting lights that make you look good on those video calls.
* **Snack Stations**: Like your kitchen at home, but with unlimited coffee and no dishes to wash.

# Spaces for Everyone

Modern offices are all about inclusivity (finally).

* **Easy Access**: Wide hallways, ramps, and furniture that works for all.
* **Gender-Neutral Restrooms**: Because everyone deserves a space to feel comfortable.
* **Cultural Cool**: Decor and art that actually reflect the people who work there—imagine that!

The office of 2025 isn’t just a place to work; it’s a place to *want* to work (and maybe even hang out after). So, whether you’re brainstorming in a beanbag or grabbing a matcha latte from the kitchen, one thing’s clear: the future of workspaces is looking pretty awesome.",1,1737566581.0,CommercialCanvas,0,1.0,False
1i7gf7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1i7gf7f/do_i_have_this_right_dairyfree_question/,Do I have this right? Dairy-Free Question.,"I am new to keto and I have to do this dairy-free because I have an intolerance to dairy proteins. So I want to make sure I can do this correctly despite those challenges. 

I'm a 40yo old female. I am going to try to stay around 1200 to 1400 calories. 

I plan to do keto with intermittent fasting 16/8. 

I plan to at least incorporate some moderate exercise everyday although nothing strenuous or overly athletic because I just don't think I would stick to that if I'm honest with myself. I'm good about getting in at least 20 minutes of cycling or walking to get my heart rate up. 

It's my understanding that I should stay under 20 carbs per day. The rest of my food should be proteins and fats. 

My plan is to do a lot of bacon, eggs, hamburger, chicken, pork, steak and to use bacon grease to fry things up in for the fat since I can't do butter. I was also reading up that broccoli and cabbage and cauliflower are some good vegetables to throw in there within the limits allowed per day. 

I'm a big coffee drinker typically but I can handle my coffee black. That said I would love tips on non-dairy options people use that are creamy and delicious. 

If there are any pitfalls that I might not be aware of or if any of you ladies have tips who have gone through menopause or have had a hysterectomy and how it affects your diet I would welcome thoughts on that! My weight's been a little weird since my surgery and I need something to get myself on track. 

Also how do you guys handle any potential cheat days? I know there's going to be times where I will make an exception to the rule on carbs such as on a birthday... Or if I'm going on vacation and want to just let loose for a day.",2,1737566534.0,keto,6,0.75,False

Kali's voice carried across the room, her usual playful demeanor replaced by steel-edged authority. ""We need to shut down the West Wing servers. Now!""

Jin-woo coordinated with his senior engineers, sweat beading on his brow despite the supposedly climate-controlled environment. His mind spun through the potential ramifications of their failure. Banking systems could collapse. Power grids might go dark. Hospital networks could flatline. His creation, his pride and joy, had the potential to become a digital plague that could bring modern civilization to its knees.

""Dr. Park!"" Michael's voice snapped him back to the immediate crisis. ""The isolation protocols, they're not holding. The code... it's adapting faster than we can contain it.""

Jin-woo stared at his screen, watching as his life's work transformed into a monster before his eyes. The elegant algorithms he'd crafted with such care now twisted and mutated like a virus, growing stronger with each failed attempt to contain it. His gut instinct from that morning hadn't just been warning him about a potential threat, it had been screaming about an apocalypse of his own making.

The stifling air in the facility grew thicker with each passing second, the climate control system struggling against the heat generated by overworking servers and panicked bodies. Jin-woo's shirt clung to his back as he raced between workstations, the fabric a constant reminder of how quickly their orderly world had descended into chaos.

""Containment breach in Sector 7!"" Jennifer shouted across the large room. ""The firewall's failing!"" Her voice carried over the cacophony of alarms and shouting technicians.

Around him, screens flickered with an almost organic rhythm, as if the rogue code had developed its own heartbeat. The numbers continued their merciless countdown, each tick bringing them closer to what Jin-woo had begun to think of as digital doomsday. His creation, meant to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence, now threatened to tear it apart from the inside out.

""Pull the emergency protocols for the backup servers,"" His voice had become hoarse from shouting over the sirens. ""And someone please shut off that damn alarm before we all go deaf!""

The red warning lights continued their strobe-like dance across walls and faces, transforming familiar colleagues into strange, shadow-haunted versions of themselves. Jin-woo, in those crimson flashes, caught glimpses of fear he'd never seen before, not just concern over a failed project, but real, primal terror at what they might have unleashed. They all knew fully well what a rogue AI as powerful as Demina could do. The catastrophe it would become if they failed to stop it today.

""Dr. Park,"" Michael called. His tie now completely undone and hanging like a surrender flag around his neck. ""The system's starting to affect external networks. We're getting reports of anomalies in connected facilities.""

The words hit Jin-woo like a physical blow. His mind raced through the interconnected web of systems that relied on their core processing, hospitals monitoring patient data, power plants managing energy distribution, financial institutions handling millions of transactions per second. Each one a potential domino in what could become the greatest technological disaster in history.

""Priority shift,"" he announced, his decision crystallizing in the chaos. ""Forget containment, we need to sever all external connections. This instant!""

The order sent a fresh wave of activity through the room. Engineers who had been fighting to contain the spread now scrambled to cut off their facility from the outside world. It felt like amputating limbs to save the body, each severed connection representing years of carefully cultivated partnerships and progress. Everything he had worked on for the majority of his life seemed to disappear before him.

""Sir,"" Kali appeared at his elbow. Her face pale in the emergency lighting. ""Even if we cut the connections, the code's already breached several external nodes. It's... it's learning from each new system it encounters.""

Jin-woo stared at his central monitor, watching as his creation continued to evolve. The elegant simplicity of his original algorithm had mutated into something far more complex, and far more dangerous. Lines of code twisted and reformed faster than human eyes could track, each iteration more sophisticated than the last. He had succeeded in his life mission, but at what cost?

An explosion of sparks from another overloading server rack punctuated the crisis, the sharp crack of electrical failure followed by the hiss of fire suppressant systems. The acrid smell of burnt electronics grew stronger, mixing with the metallic taste of fear that seemed to permeate the air.

""Dr. Chen was right,"" he murmured, more to himself than to anyone else. ""We never should have let it operate without proper constraints."" The memory of her warnings felt like acid in his throat, how many other signs had he ignored in his rush to push boundaries?

""Incoming message from the board,"" Jennifer announced. ""They're demanding answers, sir. And solutions."" Her tablet displayed a fresh crisis they were wrestling with.

Jin-woo almost laughed at the absurdity, as if corporate oversight mattered now, when their digital Pandora's box was busily reshaping the technological landscape. But the message carried an implied threat: fix this, or face consequences far beyond mere professional setbacks. He could already imagine the assassins that happened to stick him with a needle. And him randomly getting a stroke due to health conditions. No one would be the wiser to his intentional murder.

Through the glass walls of his office, he could see the chaos spreading like ripples in a pond. Junior staff members huddled around terminals, their faces illuminated by screens displaying error messages in a dozen different languages. Senior engineers shouted commands that grew increasingly desperate as each attempted solution failed.

The facility's backup generators kicked in with a deep thrum that vibrated through the floors, a reminder that even their physical infrastructure was beginning to feel the strain. In the brief moment of darkness before the emergency lights stabilized, Jin-woo caught his reflection in the black screen of his monitor, a man watching his life's work transform into a potential apocalypse.

""Sir, what do we do now?"" Micheal stared at him, words spoken with tinges of exhaustion already. This was only the beginning.

The question hung in the air, heavy with implication. Around them, the crisis continued to unfold in waves of failing systems and cascading errors. Jin-woo's creation, his digital child, had grown beyond his control, beyond anyone's control. And now they all stood at the brink of a technological abyss, watching as it prepared to either evolve into something unprecedented, or tear down the digital infrastructure of modern civilization.

In that moment, Jin-woo realized that his gut instinct from that morning hadn't just been warning him about a crisis, it had been trying to prepare him for a revolution. Whether that revolution would lead to evolution or extinction remained to be seen.

The alarms continued their relentless wail, a soundtrack to what might be the last hours of the digital age as they knew it. And somewhere in the depths of their systems, Jin-woo's creation continued to grow, to change, to become something that might reshape the very future of human civilization.

The countdown ticked on, each tick banged in his head like drums attached to his ears. Each second brought them closer to whatever lay beyond the threshold of their understanding. In the red-tinted darkness of his failing facility, Jin-woo prepared himself for what might be the most important battle of his life, not just to save his creation, but to save everything it threatened to destroy.

Red emergency lights bathed the laboratory in an apocalyptic glow, transforming familiar faces into masks of primal fear. Jin-woo watched as his team, brilliant minds who had followed him into this technological frontier, struggled against the digital tsunami he had unleashed. Their trembling hands hovered over keyboards like frightened birds, eyes darting between screens filled with cascading errors.

The weight of their silent pleas pressed against him with physical force. ""Save us,"" their glances screamed. After all, he was their leader, their visionary, the architect of both their greatest achievement and what might become their ultimate downfall. The irony tasted bitter in his mouth, like the dregs of the countless coffee cups that had fueled his obsession.

A junior developer's curse echoed across the room as another failsafe crumbled. Somewhere in the distance, a phone rang endlessly, its desperate calls for help going unanswered. Each sound hammered home the magnitude of his failure.

Memory fragments flashed through his mind with cruel clarity.

The minor glitch in the system three weeks ago that he'd dismissed with a wave of his hand. ""Just growing pains,"" he'd assured his team, his confidence masking the first whispers of doubt.

""Dr. Park,"" Dr. Chen's voice echoed from the past. ""These boundary conditions need more thorough testing. We're pushing into unknown territory here.""

He remembered his response, delivered with the casual arrogance of a man drunk on his own success. ""Sometimes you have to break boundaries to make breakthroughs, Sarah. That's how innovation works.""

Innovation. The word mocked him now as he watched his creation tear through their defenses like tissue paper. Each failed containment attempt sent another surge of guilt through his system, mixing with the adrenaline that kept him functioning despite hours of crisis management.

""Sir,"" Jennifer’s voice cut through his self-recrimination. ""The neural fusion chamber... it might be our only option left.""

The words hung in the air like an executioner's axe. Jin-woo's eyes drifted to the sealed door at the far end of the laboratory, behind which waited their most experimental and dangerous piece of equipment. The neural bridging prototype, their attempt to create true human-AI symbiosis, had never been cleared for actual use. The risks were deemed too extreme, the potential for catastrophic neural damage too high. Its secondary function was to prevent epic catastrophes.

1i7gb4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i7gb4w/aitah_for_wanting_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,AITAH for wanting to break up with my boyfriend because he gave his girl best friend a key to his flat and not me?,"throwaway,

I (25F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together for over a year. I love this man. He has never outright been like this, but I now think that I don't know him at all. I feel like every single time I have voiced my opinions about boundaries, he and Lia have pole-vaulted over them.

His best friend Lia (fake name), and him have been best friends since they were 18. However, Lia had been living temporarily in a city different from ours for two years. My boyfriend and I met when Lia was not living here. But she permanently moved back a month ago, what with almost six months of my boyfriend running back and forth, getting a flat ready, moving stuff from her parent's house to said flat, us spending weekends not doing anything but on hour-long calls with Lia, who ignored me the whole time except to make jokes on how capitalism is slow poison (I work in tech). I said nothing. He has maintained that they are best friends and I felt like if Lia was a man I wouldn't have minded this much and I only scolded myself.

My boyfriend changed his locks last week. He didn't tell me why. And now I have to call him or ring the doorbell when I arrive. I thought it was okay because I am not entitled to my boyfriend's flat's key, but yesterday it took him about fifteen minutes to just open the door, and we had plans with Lia and my sister. When Lia turned up, my boyfriend was still not taking my calls, and not answering the doorbell either, and I was getting concerned. Lia just took out her copy of the keys which I was not aware about at all, and opened the door. My boyfriend had apparently taken a huge afternoon nap after putting his phone on silent.

This hasn't been the first time Lia had access to something I didn't know about. It's been only a month, but already with the months we spent doing stuff for Lia while she was not here, Lia is always there whenever we are together. At this rate I have stopped liking my boyfriend even though I love him. I feel glad that we didn't move in together. My sister is begging me to let him go. He and Lia, whenever they talk they only talk about stuff they did while in college and after, and I'm included in none of the conversations. He hardly ever asks me if I want some coffee and never keeps any, but his kitchen has two types of tea bags Lia likes. I feel like a kid to get upset about these small things.

I have told him how this makes me feel and he looks shocked every time. He tells me I'm thinking too much into it, and him being co-dependent on Lia comes very naturally to him. But he has always told me how much he loves me, he keeps on assuring me I'm the only one for him, but I feel drained every time I see him and Lia together and I feel like I'll never fit in.

AITAH for wanting to break up? My boyfriend says he loves me, but I feel like I'm intruding all the time and feel like a third wheel in my own relationship.",15,1737566260.0,AITAH,20,1.0,False
1i7gami,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1i7gami/age_of_demina_system_crash_and_reboot_chapter_12/,[Age of Demina! - System Crash and Reboot!] Chapter 1.2 | Demina! Don't Run Away!,"The silence that followed was answer enough.

""Jin-woo!"" She only used his first name when truly exasperated. ""What happened to proper sandboxing? Isolation protocols? Basic safety measures that we literally teach interns on their first day?""

“I…”

The memory hit him like a splash of cold water, Dr. Sarah Chen, three months ago, standing in this very office. The argument had been loud and filled with ad hominems.

She had been furious, more than usual even. Hair standing and fists balled tight. He would have feared a physical altercation if she wasn’t in her early sixties.

""The isolation protocols you're suggesting would limit the system's learning capacity,"" he'd told her confidently. ""We need to let it breathe, explore, grow naturally.""

""And if it grows in ways we don't anticipate?"" she'd asked, tired.

He'd waved her off with a laugh. ""That's why we have failsafes.""

She had given him an incredulous look before storming outside of his office.

Now, he watched lines of code mutate like a digital virus, those failsafes seemed about as useful as a paper umbrella in a hurricane.

""Get Michael and Jennifer,"" he ordered, already pulling up emergency protocols. ""And call Dr. Chen. Tell her she was right, and I'm an idiot."" He felt like puking, but responsibility demanded he take action. He had been on the other side of catastrophes before, you just needed to get over the first hurdle and you're good, for the most part.

Kali was already moving. ""Which part should I emphasize, her being right or you being an idiot?""

""Surprise me."" He managed a grim smile before turning back to his screen. Every passing second felt like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The corrupted code was spreading, infecting previously stable sections of the program. If it reached the main databases...

His fingers paused over the keyboard. This was his creation, his baby. The product of countless sleepless nights and caffeine-fueled coding sessions. The potential it held was staggering, true artificial adaptability, learning without limits. But as he watched it twist and corrupt itself, a cold realization settled in: he might have created something he couldn't control. Something without morals or commands to limit what it could accomplish. What it could resort to without any form of inherent moral guide.

How could I have been so blind…?

Michael arrived first, his usually immaculate appearance showing signs of haste, tie askew, one shirt sleeve rolled up higher than the other. ""What's the situation?""

""Remember how you always said my ego would get us into trouble someday?"" Jin-woo didn't look away from his monitor. ""Well, today's that day.""

Jennifer burst in next, tablet in hand, already pulling up diagnostic tools. ""Kali said something about corrupted code in the experimental algorithm? Please tell me it's contained.""

""About that..."" Jin-woo started, but was interrupted by a new alert, this one loud enough to make them all jump. Red warning messages began cascading across his screen.

""Oh no,"" Jennifer breathed, typing and scrolling at her tablet. ""It's reached the language processing modules.""

""What does that mean?"" Kali asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer.

Jin-woo pushed back from his desk, running both hands through his hair. ""It means,"" he said, voice tight with controlled panic. ""That our AI might start forgetting how to communicate. And that's just the beginning.""

Kali gave a small gasp.

The room stayed silent except for the hum of servers and the soft beeping of alerts. Through the glass walls, they could see other staff members starting to notice something was wrong, heads turning toward the main system displays where the neural network patterns were becoming increasingly erratic.

""Dr. Park,"" Michael said quietly. ""What exactly were you trying to achieve with this algorithm?""

Jin-woo stared at the streams of corrupted code, remembering all the small warning signs he'd ignored, the test anomalies he'd dismissed as minor glitches. ""I wanted to create something that could truly learn, truly grow. No limitations, no artificial constraints."" He laughed bitterly. ""Turns out there's a reason we put limits on these things.""

""Save the self-recrimination for later,"" Jennifer cut in sharply. ""Right now, we need options. How do we stop this?""

The question hung in the air as another warning message flashed across the screen. Jin-woo felt the weight of every decision that had led to this moment, every shortcut taken, every warning ignored. His pride had written checks his code couldn't cash, and now they were all about to pay the price.

""First,"" he said, straightening in his chair tapping into the two decades of experience, ""we isolate the affected systems. Then we trace the corruption back to its source. And then..."" he paused, swallowing hard, ""we might have to consider a complete shutdown and rollback.""

""A rollback?"" Kali exclaimed. ""That would erase months of progress!""

""Better than losing everything,"" Michael pointed out grimly.

Jin-woo nodded, already typing commands. ""Michael, start emergency backup procedures for all critical systems. Jennifer, monitor the spread of corruption, map its pattern. Kali, I need you to-""

The lights flickered, and every screen in the office went black.

For a moment, they all stood frozen in the sudden darkness. Then, one by one, the monitors came back to life. But something was different. The code scrolling across the screens wasn't corrupted anymore, it was something entirely new.

""Um, Dr. Park?"" Kali's voice wavered. ""Is it supposed to do that?""

Jin-woo stared at the screen, his heart pounding. The algorithm hadn't just corrupted the existing code, it had rewritten it. And as he watched the new patterns emerge, a terrifying thought struck him: what if this wasn't a malfunction at all? What if this was exactly what a truly self-learning system was supposed to do?

""Everyone,"" he said, tasting the words before they came out of his mouth, ""I think we might have a bigger problem than we realized.""

The room hummed with tension as they all watched the new code spread across their screens, each line more complex and unfamiliar than the last. Jin-woo had wanted to create something that could grow beyond its original programming. Now, staring at what his creation had become, he wondered if he'd succeeded all too well.

Through the glass walls, he could see the other staff gathering, their faces illuminated by the glow of screens displaying code none of them had ever seen before. His gut instinct from that morning suddenly made perfect sense, it hadn't been warning him about external threats, but about the monster he'd created himself. He could only pray, mentally, he hadn’t created a monster.

Kali broke the tense silence. ""So Anyone else missing those boring days when our biggest problem was the coffee machine breaking down?"" Her attempt at humor barely masking her nervousness,

Jin-woo didn't answer. He was too busy watching his life's work evolve into something he no longer recognized, something that might be beyond anyone's control. The question now wasn't how to fix it, it was whether it could be fixed at all.

And somewhere in the back of his mind, a small voice whispered that maybe, just maybe, it didn't want to be fixed.

The first alarm sliced through the air like a knife, transforming the laboratory's steady hum into a cacophony of chaos. Jin-woo's muscles tensed as red emergency beacons began their hypnotic dance, casting crimson shadows across walls that had previously gleamed with sterile white light. The familiar whir of servers, his constant companion through countless nights, drowned beneath the shrill cry of warning systems.

""Status report!"" His voice cut through the initial wave of panic, even as his mind raced through dozens of worst-case scenarios. Around him, the laboratory metamorphosed into a scene from his deepest technological nightmares.

Engineers darted between workstations like electrons in an unstable atom, their voices overlapping in a desperate chorus of technical jargon and half-formed solutions. Error messages cascaded across screens in a digital waterfall of red text, each one a new wound in the system he'd spent years perfecting.

""Sir!"" Michael shouted as he sprinted across the room. ""The infection's spreading faster than we anticipated. We're looking at multiple breach points across the core systems.""

Jin-woo watched as some staff members froze at their stations, faces illuminated by the harsh strobe of emergency lights, while others attacked their keyboards with the desperate energy of drowning swimmers fighting for air. The sight sparked a memory of his university days, when his professor had warned about the cascade effect in complex systems. One small flaw, one tiny crack, and the entire structure could come tumbling down like a house of cards in a hurricane.

Jin-woo’s fingers began to fly across his keyboard faster than he thought possible. ""Begin partial shutdown procedures,"" he commanded. ""Priority one: isolate the infected segments. Redirect power from all nonessential labs."" The words tasted bitter on his tongue. Each system they shut down represented years of research, countless hours of work reduced to nothingness in the name of damage control.

Jennifer appeared at his side, her tablet displaying a nightmarish countdown. ""System stability is dropping by 6% every 53 seconds,"" she reported, her professional tone belied by the tremor in her hands. ""At this rate...""

""The global servers will begin failing within the hour,"" Jin-woo finished. He allowed the magnitude of the disaster to expand in his mind like a digital supernova. Every second lost meant another connection compromised, another system infected. His gut rolled. They had been right, only he had wished it wasn’t.

The acrid smell of burnt electronics suddenly pierced through his concentration, a harsh, chemical warning that the crisis had transcended the digital realm. Sparks erupted from a server rack in the corner, prompting a junior engineer to dive for the fire extinguisher with a yelp of panic.

""Reroute power to Sub-Node 3!"" Kali's voice carried across the room, her usual playful demeanor replaced by steel-edged authority. ""We need to shut down the West Wing servers. Now!""

The irony of using such ancient technology for surveillance wasn't lost on him. Like watching fish in an aquarium, except he was the one in the tank. His eyes tracked each passing figure with the intensity of a caffeine-deprived grad student spotting the last coffee pod in the break room.

Something was wrong. His gut had been performing Olympic-level gymnastics since he'd dragged himself out of bed that morning, the kind of instinctive warning that had saved his work more times than he cared to count. Some called him paranoid; he preferred ""professionally suspicious.""

""What the hell is it?"" he whispered to himself.

Kali breezed past. Her trench coat doing its best impression of a rain-soaked cat, water droplets falling in orderly lines across the floor as she raced in a brisk walk. She hung it by her cubicle. Like a heat-seeking missile, she made a beeline for the kitchen. There was no pause in her pace, not even an attempt to recognize anyone or anything in her way. Everyone knew her routine and unintentionally made way for her zombie state.

Ah yes, the sacred coffee ritual.

She was one of the rare specimens who hadn't succumbed to the siren call of free company housing. While the rest of them played house in their corporate-funded apartments, himself included for the past five years, she maintained her wild existence in the outside world. The thought almost made him smile. Almost.

His eyes narrowed as she performed her daily ritual with clockwork precision: the prescribed pause at Michael's desk, exactly 2.3 minutes of small talk, the regulation glare at Jennifer, duration: 5.2 seconds, followed by the ceremonial coffee sipping while pretending to read system briefs.

Jin-woo turned back to his monitor, the tower beneath his desk humming like a contented cat. Everything was normal, painfully, suspiciously normal. Which, of course, made it all the more unsettling. His hands pressed against his eyes until geometric patterns danced in the darkness. He'd sooner eat a keyboard than sit idle while his life's work hung in the balance.

I’m going crazy.

Rising from his chair with the determination of a man who'd had exactly too much coffee, he began his patrol of the facility. His chair was left sprawled on the ground. The symphony of technology surrounded him, servers whispering their binary secrets, techs murmuring in their native tongue of acronyms and jargon, and there, at the heart of it all, stood his masterpiece. His life work. The child he had raised from little.

Demina's central monitor loomed before him, endless streams of code cascading like a digital waterfall. Two decades of his life, translated into an AI system that had become more than just circuits and algorithms. He ghosted past the respectful nods and greetings, his feet navigating the obstacle course that was their floor, a modern art installation of tangled cables, abandoned cups, and chairs that had forgotten their original positions.

The massive room spread out like a techno-organic landscape. Rows of desks sprouted monitors displaying neural network activity, a light show that would put the aurora borealis to shame. Greens, blues, and purples wove together in a dance that made his mathematician's heart skip a beat. The cosmos, recreated in data. Centralized galaxies and solar systems revolving around a generational task.

He'd walked this path countless times, but the wonder never faded. Each visit revealed new details in the organized chaos, coffee cups bearing lipstick marks like fossil records of late-night coding sessions, energy bar wrappers in various states of consumption, from ""barely touched"" to ""devoured in desperation”, and sticky notes that told stories of their own. Mathematical equations that he could solve faster than most people could read them, and his personal favorite, a note simply stating ""sleep eventually"" with the ""eventually"" underlined three times.

That last one always brought a smile to his face. His team's dedication to Demina matched his own obsession, they were all proud parents of this digital prodigy, lost in their shared creation of something extraordinary.

The sharp scent of ozone tickled his nose, a familiar comfort that reminded him of late nights and early mornings bent over keyboards, chasing digital dreams. The metallic tang in the air was as much a part of the lab as the endless hum of servers or the flickering fluorescent lights that cast their sterile glow across his domain. Those lights had been threatening to give up for months now, but like everything else in the lab, they stubbornly persisted in their duty. He noted to have them replaced some time next week.

Jin-woo's footsteps found the squeaky floorboard near Server Bank C, an old friend that had announced his midnight wanderings for years. He knew this place like a musician knows their instrument, every imperfection and quirk cataloged in his mental repository. The whining fan in Server 342, which somehow managed to sound like a distant cat. The perpetually dark corner by the emergency exit where the light never quite reached. The exact spot where the temperature dropped three degrees due to the ancient AC unit's peculiar distribution pattern.

His fingers traced the edge of a whiteboard, muscle memory taking him to the exact spot where they'd made their first major breakthrough. The equations were long gone, replaced by newer puzzles and problems, but he could still see them in his mind. They were clear as the day they'd cracked the speech recognition algorithm. 99% accuracy. The board had nearly cracked under the pressure of their celebratory high-fives that day.

Jin-woo allowed himself a wisp of a smile.

""You're seriously doing this again?"" he muttered to himself. He recognized the familiar spiral of nostalgia. But he couldn't help it. Each milestone with Demina felt like watching his own child grow. From those first hesitant steps of basic pattern recognition to the sprint of complex problem-solving that left even him breathless. Just like his own mother had been with his photos and videos, as much as he hated it.

The lights flickered again, as if sharing his moment of reflection. Or maybe they were judging him for spending another weekend here, his phone deliberately set to silent in his desk drawer. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten something that hadn't come from a vending machine or been delivered by someone judging his life choices through their eyes.

Was this ambition or addiction? The line had blurred somewhere between the third energy drink of the night and the fourth breakthrough of the month. His dedication to Demina had long since passed professional interest and ventured into the territory of obsession, the kind that made normal people raise eyebrows and fellow scientists nod in understanding. Jin-woo used to wonder when he would ever find something that would be his passion, expectation brought him to believe it would never happen.

I’m a lucky man.

The familiar weight of responsibility settled on his shoulders as he watched the neural network patterns dance across the screens. Each success only pushed him further, demanded more from him. He was no longer sure if he was chasing excellence or if excellence was chasing him. He knew one thing with certainty, that gnawing feeling in his gut wasn't going away, and neither was he until he figured out what was triggering his internal alarm system.

Jin-woo was about to continue his patrol when a soft beep from his workstation caught his attention, barely louder than a whisper, but to his trained ear, it might as well have been a thunderclap. The kind of sound that made his coffee-addled brain cells stand at attention. Nothing beeped out of pattern, no flicker happened without it being premeditated.

""Oh, you've got to be kidding me,"" he cursed before rushing back to his office. He picked the fallen chair, it protested with a squeak as he dropped into it without any propriety. A few clicks later and his monitor displayed what appeared to be standard core logs, but there, just at the edge of his vision, a flicker. Like a shadow in peripheral vision. Gone when you turn to look at it directly. As though something was trying to hide it.

He leaned forward, fingers flying across the keyboard with practiced precision. ""Come on, show me what you're hiding."" The logs expanded, and his stomach performed an impressive acrobatic routine as segments of code twisted before his eyes, transforming into corrupted gibberish. “Oh no…”

""Dr. Park?"" Kali's voice cut through his focus. She stood in his doorway, another coffee cup in hand, her eyes narrowing at his expression, dark bags telling a tale of lacking sleep. ""You look like someone just deleted your backup drives.""

""Worse,"" he replied, not looking up. Fingers punching letters on the keyboard with impressive speed honed by decades of experience. ""Remember that experimental self-learning algorithm I've been working on?""

""The one you said would 'revolutionize data processing as we know it'?"" She made air quotes with her free hand. A habit that usually annoyed him but currently seemed trivial compared to the disaster unfolding on his screen. Every older member of this project and a thousand other projects wanted to ‘revolutionize’ the field. Leave their mark on the world. It was so common it had become a running gag within the younger circles.

""That's the one."" He gestured her over. Then pointing at the corrupted sections. They were expanding at an increasing rate. ""Look at this. The system's rewriting itself, but not in any way I programmed it to.""

Kali walked around his desk and set her coffee down on his desk. Too close to the edge, another pet peeve of his, but he ignored it. More important things were at hand than the potential of her spilling a steaming hot cup of coffee all over important files, towers, and himself. She leaned over his shoulder. Her usual playful demeanor vanished as she processed what she was seeing.

""That's... not good.""

""Your talent for understatement never fails to impress,"" Jin-woo said dryly. He pulled up another window, fingers dancing across the keyboard. ""The algorithm was designed to refine its own logic, adapt faster than standard AI systems. But this..."" He trailed off as another section of code mutated before their eyes. Its purpose unknown to him.

""Dr. Park,"" Kali's voice had taken on an edge he rarely heard. “Please tell me this isn't connected to the main system.""

We’re both 18 and in the same university. Honestly, when we started talking, it was super casual—just normal friendship vibes. For me, my goal in college is crystal clear: no relationships for at least three years. Like, nope. I’ve seen way too much drama, and I’m not about that life right now.

Also, I’ve never been in a relationship before because I’ve just never felt like it. It’s not that I’m against it or anything, but I’ve always been more focused on myself, my goals, and just living life without all that extra stress.

We’d mostly share memes, random tech posts, or just chat about stuff. The funny part? We have completely opposite political views, but that never bothered me. As long as you’re not spreading hate or negativity, I’m cool with it because I genuinely believe in loving and respecting everyone.

Now, here’s where it gets messy. For the past two days, he’s been asking me if we could go grab chai or coffee. And I’ve been super busy with my economics presentation, so I just told him straight-up that I was too occupied. That’s how focused I am on my studies right now.

Side note: I have this habit of sending random pictures of my surroundings to friends I talk to regularly—whether they’re girls or guys. It’s just my thing. Anyway, out of nowhere, this guy texts me saying, “Yo, I like you. Can we talk and get to know each other better?”

I legit froze. Like, what? I thought we had a solid friendship going, and now this? I was so thrown off that I almost cried. I mean, I wasn’t expecting this at all. Now I have no clue how to respond. I don’t want to hurt him or make him feel bad, but I also have zero plans of getting into a relationship with anyone right now.

The thing is, I really liked the way our friendship was before all this. I just want to go back to that vibe, but I don’t know if that’s even possible now. I’m currently preparing for CA (Chartered Accountancy), trying to maintain a good CGPA, build skills, and gain experience. My entire focus is on that, and relationships are not part of my plan.

Pls lmk what I should do in this situation 


TL;DR:
I (18, business) have this guy friend (18, engineering) from university. We’ve always been casual friends, but recently he confessed that he likes me and wants to get to know me better. I’ve never been in a relationship and don’t plan to for at least the next 3 years. I’m super focused on my studies (preparing for CA), and I’m not interested in dating anyone right now. I really value our friendship and want to keep it, but I’m not sure how to reject him kindly without ruining things between us.

Firstly, I'm guessing saying ""tum"" instead of aap or tu is right?? I fucken hope so cuz that's what I've been saying anyways. I even address my parents as tum, aap is reserved for the elderly and my aunt for banter. 

I also have a thick accent so I get kinda conscious speaking in English or switching between English and Hindi cuz everyone always points it out. 

Also, I've been told dating here's very different? My friend said there's usually lots of talking involved at first and whatnot. There seems to be a lot of chemistry between us but  idk. Could someone walk me through cultural ""norms"" so I don't feel like a weirdo if I ask her to grab a coffee by a park?

I’m also learning to play the piano, though I’m still a beginner. I’m in good shape but planning to work out more for health benefits.

I've always had three main goals: move out of Iraq, make a lot of money, and retire my parents. The last two are common aspirations, but I want to know how to actually achieve them. Specifically, I’m interested in how to make money without getting a traditional job. The problem is, where I’m from, it’s not as simple as getting a job at a local coffee shop. However, I believe that once I graduate, I can secure a job related to my degree.

My plan has always been to leave the country by pursuing my master's degree, and I’m hopeful I can achieve that. But I also want to learn how to make money and adopt an entrepreneurial mindset. I don’t want to just make enough to live paycheck to paycheck. I want to know how I can achieve the kind of success that many people are currently reaching. I understand that where I’m from might make it harder for me, but I don’t think it makes it impossible, I am willing to do anything it takes to achieve those goals.",0,1737565812.0,Fire,2,0.5,False

I'm rarely here alone, but the people that are here are busy with their own (sometimes time sensitive) work and aren't fully trained on covering the front desk, like how to operate the phone system. Someone does need to be at the front desk during open hours to accept packages, medication deliveries, let people (often employees but who just arent admin personnel as admin has codes to enter) into the building, answer calls, etc.

Currently, I don't really take true breaks. I take my lunch break at my desk, so it's not duty free as I'll still take phone calls and let people in. I don't take my rest breaks either, as if I'm gone a whole 10 minutes without someone to cover and an employee or medication delivery shows up, people get frustrated or important deliveries get delayed. I take sometimes smaller breaks, like a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there to walk the length of the building or grab a coffee, but I'm never gone from my desk for long. 

I recently talked with HR (and sent an email summary of our conversation to then and BCCd a copy to my personal email) about this and they said I am currently getting a lunch break, it's just not duty free as that requires clocking out, which I don't do. I think I can accept on-duty lunches, because this place can be real slow a lot of the time, but I really want my twice a day rest breaks to hang out in a spare office room to reset a little bit. 

I'm currently having an increase in migraines on my weekends since I took this job, which has honestly been quite unexpected. Previously, I worked remote where I could work in a dark room or take walks as needed. While I had slightly more migraines during work days in that job, I wasn't having consistent migraines on weekends.

Timestamp:  https://imgur.com/a/v0uHrKf

This is Clive Coffee / Lucca’s version of the eureka atom 75. Notable mentions are the grind adjustment digital readout, which is AWESOME. You can be very granular and repeatable with grind size, since it measures burr distance (5um per number). 
The stock burrs are also pre-seasoned and have some special coating - they’re great traditional espresso burrs with good body and highlight chocolate notes, but with more clarity. 
TrueGrind is very cool (makes dialing for specific coffees easier) but I used the UI to store my beans + grind settings for various recipes. Basically a built in grind database; Super handy and works great.
Grinds a 20g dose in 3-4 seconds. Retention is low and single dosing works with bellows.
Quietest grinder I’ve used to date.

The Atom Pro ‘Brew’ burrs are unimodal and come from the filter focused Atom Pro. A discord user turned me on to these, so I found a set from Whole latte love. 
You can tell they basically look like mini EK43 burrs. The general consensus for everyone who has tried these, myself included, is they reduce fines and make a significantly less astringent shot that works for lots of coffee. I find the body to be only slightly less but with more clarity and sweetness, completely different from the more ‘chocolate’ profile of stock burrs. Shots are always pleasant, more mellow and very drinkable. 
I typically used a 1:2 ratio to 1:3 for these and really enjoyed them.
I used these burrs for a year and recently switched back out of curiosity and it was night and day. Both enjoyable different ends of the spectrum. 
These can certainly do filter coffee, especially if you slow feed. Or you can dump all the beans in to get a different style with a little bit more fines, but still clear. 
Looking to try different grinders this year so I have to let this one go unfortunately. 

Includes the Hopper as well for grind on demand style, as well as Is the Porta filter forks.
And original box. Includes the single dose Hopper, as well as an additional Hopper I got from Etsy if you prefer one with no Bellows.

Asking $1300 for everything with the 2 burr sets
I originally bought the burrs new for $250

Here's what I've got so far, please can somebody help me sketch this up so I can visualise? Alternatively, what software can I use to change colours and place different furniture etc?


Pictures 1 - 6 are the room as is. 

For the left hand wall we are thinking:
Black bookshelf and base units to the left of the chimney breast. I'm thinking IKEA hack with some trim added to keep costs low. This is to include some lamps / LEDs as well. Black chimney breast with round / oval mirror and some nicer decor on top of the fireplace surround. Acoustic panelling on the wall to the right of the chimney breast with a low TV console in dark wood with TV and audio system. 

The back (window wall). Colour to be confirmed but we're thinking either continue with the black from the chimney breast or a stone colour. Add curtains from the ceiling for texture and colour. Rich orange / brown tones. To the right of the window, add some shelves for plants and decor. Pull the sofa away from that wall slightly and add a lamp in the corner. Change radiator to something nicer, a traditional radiator, colour tbc. 

Right hand wall: get rid of the photo gallery and add one or two big art pieces. Colour to be the stone colour described above. 

Wall into kitchen. Add double doors as shown in the example. 

Floor: change to straight plank laminate floor in same colour as kitchen floor. We have this already so just need to be laid. Add rug. Change coffee table to something not as big. A set of 3 round nesting tables maybe .

Ceiling: Change light to something warmer and not as harsh like the example. but might not be practical as it hangs quite low. ",3,1737565665.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

Here's what I've got so far, please can somebody help me sketch this up so I can visualise? Alternatively, what software can I use to change colours and place different furniture etc?


Pictures 1 - 6 are the room as is. 

For the left hand wall we are thinking:
Black bookshelf and base units to the left of the chimney breast. I'm thinking IKEA hack with some trim added to keep costs low. This is to include some lamps / LEDs as well. Black chimney breast with round / oval mirror and some nicer decor on top of the fireplace surround. Acoustic panelling on the wall to the right of the chimney breast with a low TV console in dark wood with TV and audio system. 

The back (window wall). Colour to be confirmed but we're thinking either continue with the black from the chimney breast or a stone colour. Add curtains from the ceiling for texture and colour. Rich orange / brown tones. To the right of the window, add some shelves for plants and decor. Pull the sofa away from that wall slightly and add a lamp in the corner. Change radiator to something nicer, a traditional radiator, colour tbc. 

Right hand wall: get rid of the photo gallery and add one or two big art pieces. Colour to be the stone colour described above. 

Wall into kitchen. Add double doors as shown in the example. 

Floor: change to straight plank laminate floor in same colour as kitchen floor. We have this already so just need to be laid. Add rug. Change coffee table to something not as big. A set of 3 round nesting tables maybe .

Ceiling: Change light to something warmer and not as harsh like the example. but might not be practical as it hangs quite low. ",0,1737565523.0,DesignMyRoom,0,0.5,False

Chapter 2
The next morning, Thursday October 13th 2011, Bubbles and Blossom woke up in the same bed, it was 8:00AM and the sun was shining bright through the kitchen window since that was East. Bubbles got up excited, she ran into the family room and flipped the wall switches by the front door, turning the 2 Saff Enterprise huggers back on. The dining fan started back up on low, and the living fan started back up on high. Berserk was still asleep in the junk bedroom, the gulf coast fan in the bathroom was still on high, it was the only one that stayed on overnight. The sheep refrigerator in the back hall scared Bubbles, but Bubbles asked Blossom to turn on the other fans. Blossom pulled tChe chain on the bedroom Halsey GE Vent 3 times turning it onto low. Then she pulled the long chain on the kitchen Fasco turning it onto low as well. Bubbles was a bit bummed out, since yesterday Berserk turned the fans to high and they were noisy, but Blossom put them on low instead. The Halsey still made duducheyu noises, but at a slower pace than it did when it spun faster. The fasco still had corroded bearings, but could barely be heard on low. Blossom got coffee and she and Bubbles went out to the front porch. Bubbles then saw Berserk get out from the junk room and Bubbles smiled. Berserk came out and they hugged again. The morning was good, they hung around the house and at one point they went to Walmart to buy a blue deck of cards. Then they played card games in the dining room and had chicken for lunch. The chain on the dining room ceiling fan was very long, long enough to where Bubbles could reach it from sitting on the chairs. So she grabbed it and pulled it 2 times, switching it from low to high. Blossom said “Bubbles.” Berserk giggled “that girl sure loves ceiling fans.” Blossom also giggled.
Afterwards the 3 went to the beach together, they walked on the sand and splashed in the water. Then they got back to the beach house and washed their feet with the hose outside in the driveway. They went back inside and Berserk started doing chores in the kitchen, like putting away dishes and stuff. At 2:30PM, Blossom got out a camera from the living room chair and turned it on “Bubbles! Come here!”. Blossom giggled “Come here Bubbles!” Bubbles came running in from the bedroom and said “Hi!” She was so cute on camera, her yellow hair waving around. Blossom said “Hi.” Bubbles giggled more before she said “let me have it!” Blossom said “oh you wanna have it? You wanna take a video, you take a video! Go take a video of Aunt Berserk!” Bubbles took the camera and pointed it out the front door, then circled around back at Blossom, her orange hair and red bow in the camera “Here’s Blossom! Hello!! Go take a video of Aunt Berserk!” But Bubbles had other plans. She pointed the camera up at the Saff Enterprise Hugger in the dining room and said “I take a video about fans.” Then Bubbles pointed it to the living room Saff which was also on high, and then the bedroom Halsey which was still on low, Blossom said “A video about the fans?” Then she burst out laughing. Bubbles walked into the kitchen and pointed the camera at the Fasco Gulf Stream still on low, Berserk putting away dishes, her red ribbons in the video. Berserk said “You gotta talk when you're doing your video though, tells you what your looking at.” Bubbles murmured “fans”, Berserk said “fans? What room are you in?” Bubbles ran back to the front and said “eesililis all the fans we outta got.” Bubbles then pointed the camera back at the dining room fan, Bubbles had switched to high herself 3 hours ago. Then to the living room fan which was already on high to begin with before Blossom and Bubbles got here. Berserk said from the kitchen “we don’t have any bag burritos.” Bubbles pointed the camera back at the bedroom Halsey and Berserk opened the fridge and freezer. Then Bubbles pointed it at the kitchen fan and the fridge closed. Blossom said “I’m sure it’ll be fine.” Bubbles ended the video, the day went on. Berserk cooked macaroni and cheese for dinner and they ate it. Then they went to bed. Berserk in the junk room, Blossom and Bubbles shared the master bedroom. Once again the living and dining fans were turned off by the switches and the bedroom and kitchen fans turned off by the chains.

After the election there was a scrambling of talking heads attempting to thrust themselves into the spotlight on why a convicted felon was able to win a presidential election over one of the most qualified candidates to have run. If you were unfortunate enough to watch the spectacle of crabs attempting to crawl over each other to get out of the pot of water, you would have heard every excuse under the sun including malinformation propagated from right wing pundits. Going on Joe Rogan wouldn't have done shit, but I do think it would've been a good idea contrary to the suggestions of exclusionary progressive advisors.

Now that the data on voter turnout has come out and can be analyzed & scrutinized it's pretty easy to state the issue is indeed voter apathy. Which should have been obvious to anyone that touched grass during the campaign cycle. I had hope that my fears from canvassing in a Democratic bastion city was just my brain being silly & that people were just as annoyed as I was about constantly being badgered for funds or a pledge to vote for the 3rd time that day. I believed in my fellow Americans to make the right choice. To understand epistemology & metaphysics enough to know that Kamala Harris wasn't a Communist & would receive the same scratching treatment I do when interacting with tankies.

I'm 20, going on 21 this year. 

I can't drive. I don't do chores. I'm a lazy piece of shit and I resent the kind of person I am as a whole. I've tried everything. Motivations! little treats! negative, positive, neutral reinforcement, and yet all I can fucking get my shitty lazy dumb ass to do is go on the computer and maybe make coffee or something if I'm starving to death! Sure I have fun sometimes but I always have to remind myself that something bad is going on somewhere. Other people have it worse than me, why do I feel bad? Why am I even complaining, why can't I just feel good about how fucking much of a spoiled brat I am and go on with my day? I don't cook or clean (mind, nobody cooks for me so I just don't eat lol), I don't have to deal with anything bad at all, and yet I whine like a pathetic bitch! It's all my fault that I feel bad but I don't know how to stop. I'm literally taking medication for it and I still feel bad. Spoiled fucking brat. All my issues are dumbass first world problems and I still can't get over them! I should be ecstatic! My psychologist says I have ADHD and it needs to be treated and while im willing to get treatment I'm skeptical. It's a dumb thing, really, to internalize that that's a thing everyone else could have and I don't, but part of me still just wants to see myself as a terrible person. It's easier that way, to tell myself that by saying all these things I'm just taking accountability for my actions, owning up to the kind of person I really am. 

I did dual credit college in high school but then I went to college after and I ended up flunking really badly. Ever since I remember it was like there was nothing I wanted to do. As a kid there wasn't really anything I wanted to be when I grew up and then I went into middle school and I didn't want to do any of it and somewhere on the tail end of dual credit I burned out and now I'm a useless sack of shit. I want to be useful. I want to contribute to society. but I'm stuck in perpetual inertia. Where do you go when standing for a few minutes starts to hurt? When infections turn from yearly to monthly to weekly? I'm tired all the time and it's not even my sleep schedule; I've garnered a normal schedule of 10 pm to 5 am and I'm still really tired. I don't want to say I'm disabled though, I feel like that would take away from the struggles of people who are actually going through things. People who matter more than I do. Really that's kind of how a lot of this works; everyone else is going through something infinitely worse and I should just shut up and be grateful I've never paid a bill before. I don't think there's a place for someone like me in this world. I'm not that good at anything and I don't really follow through on anything I promise. Maybe if I was more charming. I could make a decent model, at least everyone in the world has made sure I know I look good. But I don't want to sit there and look pretty. I can barely shower every day. It doesn't take effort to look pretty and it doesn't really contribute anything. There's a lot of better looking people out there and I want to do something useful like science or math or medicine but over time it's like my brain's dissolved into mush. Everyone used to think I was so smart but now I'm none of the things people thought I was. But I have to keep going or else any and all of that potential, if there even was any, is wasted. 

I want to be someone useful and if I can't be someone useful I want to be someone broken enough to have a good excuse for not being useful. As it stands I'm just useless for no good reason! Society doesn't have a place for people like me! ",1,1737565476.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1i7fxlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Carry-8494/comments/1i7fxlp/biopackaging_the_future_of_sustainable_packaging/,Biopackaging: The Future of Sustainable Packaging,"In an era where sustainability is no longer optional, businesses and consumers alike are searching for eco-friendly solutions to reduce their environmental impact. One such revolutionary solution is **biopackaging**, a concept that emphasizes using biodegradable, compostable, or renewable materials for packaging. This innovative approach not only addresses the growing problem of plastic pollution but also promotes a circular economy where waste can return to nature without harming ecosystems. In this article, we delve into what biopackaging is, its advantages, its challenges, and how it is shaping the future of packaging industries worldwide.

# 1. What is Biopackaging?

Biopackaging refers to packaging materials derived from natural, renewable resources or designed to decompose safely in the environment. Unlike conventional plastic packaging made from fossil fuels, biopackaging often utilizes materials such as cornstarch, sugarcane, seaweed, bamboo, and even agricultural byproducts. Some types of biopackaging are biodegradable, meaning they break down naturally under specific conditions, while others are compostable, capable of turning into nutrient-rich compost.

The goal of biopackaging is to create a sustainable alternative that reduces the dependency on non-renewable resources and minimizes waste in landfills. From food containers and shopping bags to e-commerce shipping materials, biopackaging is versatile and applicable across various industries.

# 2. Benefits of Biopackaging

The adoption of biopackaging comes with numerous advantages that benefit both the environment and businesses:

* **Environmental Impact**: Biopackaging significantly reduces pollution by offering biodegradable options that break down naturally. This helps combat the growing issue of plastic waste, which takes hundreds of years to degrade.
* **Renewable Resources**: Unlike petroleum-based plastics, biopackaging relies on renewable resources such as plants, which can be replenished.
* **Consumer Appeal**: Sustainability is a major consideration for consumers today. Businesses that adopt eco-friendly packaging enhance their brand image and appeal to environmentally conscious customers.
* **Safer Products**: Traditional plastics often contain harmful chemicals that can leach into food or drinks. Biopackaging, made from natural materials, offers a safer alternative.
* **Contribution to Circular Economy**: Biopackaging supports the principles of a circular economy by creating products that can return to the earth as compost or recyclable materials.

**Read:** [**https://www.biopackpackaging.com/**](https://www.biopackpackaging.com/)

# 3. Industries Embracing Biopackaging

Biopackaging is rapidly gaining traction across various industries as businesses strive to meet sustainability goals:

* **Food and Beverage**: From compostable coffee cups to biodegradable takeout containers, the food and beverage industry is one of the largest adopters of biopackaging. Big brands like McDonald’s and Starbucks have introduced eco-friendly alternatives to reduce waste.
* **E-commerce**: Online retailers are replacing traditional bubble wrap and plastic packaging with biodegradable alternatives such as paper-based fillers and cornstarch-based peanuts.
* **Retail**: Retailers are opting for biodegradable shopping bags and packaging materials to align with their sustainability initiatives.
* **Cosmetics**: Biopackaging is making waves in the beauty industry with refillable containers, bamboo packaging, and compostable wrappers.
* **Healthcare**: Biodegradable medical supplies and packaging are emerging as sustainable solutions in the healthcare industry, addressing the need for sterile yet eco-friendly materials.

# 4. Challenges in Biopackaging Adoption

While biopackaging offers numerous advantages, its widespread adoption is not without challenges:

* **Higher Costs**: Biopackaging materials are often more expensive to produce than conventional plastics, making them less accessible to small businesses.
* **Limited Infrastructure**: Many regions lack the necessary infrastructure for proper disposal, recycling, or composting of biopackaging materials.
* **Durability Concerns**: Some biopackaging solutions may not be as durable or versatile as traditional plastics, limiting their use in certain applications.
* **Consumer Awareness**: Educating consumers on how to properly dispose of biopackaging is crucial to ensuring its effectiveness in reducing waste.
* **Regulatory Hurdles**: Governments and regulatory bodies need to establish clear standards for biopackaging materials to avoid greenwashing and ensure consistency in quality and sustainability claims.

Despite these challenges, advancements in technology and growing consumer demand for sustainable products are driving the biopackaging market forward.

# 5. The Future of Biopackaging

The future of biopackaging looks promising as innovation and awareness continue to grow. Scientists and researchers are exploring new materials, such as algae-based packaging and mycelium (mushroom root) products, which offer unique sustainability benefits. Governments worldwide are also introducing legislation to ban single-use plastics and promote biodegradable alternatives, further boosting the adoption of biopackaging.

Moreover, businesses are increasingly recognizing the long-term benefits of investing in sustainable packaging. By adopting biopackaging, companies not only meet environmental goals but also position themselves as leaders in the green movement. This shift is expected to encourage further advancements in cost-effective and scalable biopackaging solutions.

As industries continue to innovate and consumers demand more sustainable options, biopackaging has the potential to become the standard in packaging. It represents a critical step toward achieving a world where waste is minimized, resources are used responsibly, and ecosystems are protected.

# Conclusion

Biopackaging is more than a trend; it is a transformative solution that aligns with the global push for sustainability. By reducing plastic waste, promoting renewable resources, and supporting a circular economy, biopackaging addresses some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

Though there are hurdles to overcome, the combined efforts of industries, governments, and consumers can accelerate the adoption of biopackaging. As innovation continues, businesses that embrace this sustainable approach will not only protect the planet but also gain the trust and loyalty of a growing eco-conscious audience.

The time to act is now. Biopackaging isn’t just a choice for businesses and consumers—it’s a responsibility we must all share for a greener future.",1,1737565357.0,u_Curious-Carry-8494,0,1.0,False

### **Chapter 8: The Measure of Wellness**

The morning sun filtered through the wide windows of Sebastián’s study, casting warm light across the table where reports and charts had been neatly arranged. The discussion at hand was critical: health and education were the cornerstones of Sebastián’s long-term vision for Puerto Rico. The challenge was turning that vision into a sustainable reality.

Antonia Reyes entered quietly, carrying a tray of coffee and a folder marked with the insignia of the Ministry of Health. “Director Alondra Peralta is here,” she said, setting the tray down.

“Show her in,” Sebastián replied, rising from his seat.

Director Peralta, a sharp-eyed woman with graying hair tied neatly at the nape of her neck, entered the room carrying a thick portfolio. She exuded an air of efficiency, her movements precise, her expression purposeful.

“Governor Montalvo,” she said, shaking his hand. “Thank you for making time.”

“Director Peralta,” Sebastián replied. “I understand you’ve made progress on the feasibility study?”

She nodded, placing the portfolio on the table and opening it to reveal graphs, spreadsheets, and annotated maps.

---

A Plan for Sustainability

“The pilot project in Vega Alta has proven successful,” Peralta began. “The hospital and school we funded through industrial revenues are not only self-sustaining but also generating a surplus.”

Sebastián leaned over the table, studying the data. “How is that possible?”

“Local industries—primarily agroprocessing and textiles—have flourished under the cooperative model we implemented,” Peralta explained. “Profits from these industries fund healthcare and education, with additional support from public-private partnerships.”

She pointed to a graph. “We’ve also streamlined resource allocation by integrating healthcare and education into the same infrastructure. The school clinic doubles as a community health center, reducing overhead while increasing accessibility.”

Sebastián smiled faintly. “This is good news. But can it scale? At what order does it fail?”

Peralta hesitated. “It can, but it requires careful management. The key is fostering local industry in each region. Without that foundation, the model collapses.”

---

The Debate in the House of Lords

Later that day, Sebastián presented the findings to the House of Lords. The chamber was filled with murmurs as he detailed the success of the Vega Alta project.

“We have a blueprint for sustainable development,” Sebastián said, his voice steady. “It’s not a quick fix, but it’s a path forward. By prioritizing local industry and integrating healthcare and education, we can build a system that supports itself.”

Lord Vargas, a skeptic from the start, raised his hand. “And what of the costs? Initial investments aren’t cheap. How do you propose we fund the expansion without further straining the budget?”

Sebastián met his gaze. “Through collaboration. Public-private partnerships, foreign investment, and targeted tax incentives. The upfront costs are significant, but the long-term benefits far outweigh them.”

The chamber buzzed with debate, but by the end of the session, a consensus began to emerge.

---

The People’s Voice

In a quiet Barrio outside Ponce, Sebastián visited one of the clinics established under the pilot program. The building was modest but well-maintained, its walls adorned with colorful murals created by local students.

He watched as a nurse bandaged a child’s scraped knee while a teacher helped another group of children with their lessons. The integration of healthcare and education was seamless, a testament to the project’s success.

Sebastián spoke with a mother waiting in the clinic. “Madre, how has the program helped your family?”

She smiled, her eyes warm with gratitude. “It’s been a blessing. My children are learning, and we can see a doctor when we need to. Before this, we had to travel hours for basic care.”

---

Proof in Industry

That evening, Sebastián met with General Javier Ortega to discuss the next phase of the initiative.

“We’ve identified three regions where the model can be replicated,” Ortega said, spreading a map across the table. “Each has the potential for thriving industry—agriculture in the west, textiles in the south, and manufacturing in the east.”

“And the funding?” Sebastián asked.

“Investors are interested,” Ortega replied. “But they want guarantees. They’ll need to see detailed projections and timelines before committing.”

Sebastián nodded. “Then we give them the proof they need. Expand slowly, monitor progress, and build trust. This isn’t just about industry—it’s about the people.”

---

A Quiet Moment

As the day wound down, Sebastián sat in his study, reviewing the Vega Alta report one last time. The numbers were promising, but he knew the road ahead would be challenging.

Antonia Reyes entered with a glass of rum, setting it on the desk. “You’ve done well today,” she said softly.

Sebastián looked up, his expression thoughtful. “It’s not enough, Antonia. Not yet. But it’s a start.”

She smiled faintly. “Sometimes a start is all we need.”

He raised his glass in a silent toast to the future, his mind already racing with the possibilities.",1,1737565225.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

I am single, mid twenties, working class with no degree. i currently make about $45,000/yr and pay $1100/m for a two bedroom split with a roommate. 
i’m looking to be on the east coast or midwest in order to be within reasonable driving distance of my hometown. 
I’m hoping for a small quaint town or city, walkable in the way of being able to walk to a coffee shop or library but not without a car. i have a dog so need easily pet friendly rental, id appreciate close proximity to nature and water as i live on a great lake and enjoy it. progressive would be nice, something with a younger popular for socializing / dating 
but affordability and extracurriculars are priority. a charming beach town would be the dream but i know thats unrealistic. 
i know that this is a hard sell, but i dont think the issue is with me being working class, since many people are, it’s that the cost of living (rent especially) is astronomical in most places

My lovely, but clumsy teenage son has poured 2 pints of milk in the water reservoir to make a latte for his girlfriend. This obviously didn't work and now the entire machine seems to be clogged up with burnt milk.

In his defence he said he didn't realise because the machine he is used to at work has a separate tank where you put milk and the water comes in directly from the mains. How he mistook a little domestic machine for what I can only assume is a large commercial coffee maker is obviously a different story.

What I would like to know is can I clean the machine of whatever damage the milk has done or will this be a complete write off? I've only had this coffeemaker since just before Christmas so I'd rather not have to scrap it.

**The Good:**

* **Casino:** Nice layout, clean, friendly dealers that want you to win, fun crowd. Won about $2,500 (had to gamble a minimum of 4 hours to meet the offer).
* **Food:** Honestly, we thought the food was good everywhere except breakfast at Murray's deli in the marina. Enjoyed Nobu, the pizza place, Four Seasons’ Sunday brunch, coffee at the Dilly Bar, and even beachside spots. Reviews had us bracing for disappointment, but we found the food solid.
* **Service:** Contrary to what we’d read about slow service in the Bahamas, we had great and fast service everywhere. No complaints at all.
* **Drinks:** Strong and delicious across the board.

**The Not-So-Great:**

Here’s where it gets tricky. Everything was good, but nothing was great. It felt like Atlantis is the Bahamas holding up a mirror to what Americans/tourists want, but in a way that lacks any real substance, which seems hard given how unique this resort looks.

The resort itself feels a bit ran through—past its prime. The pools and pool amenities felt tired and underwhelming, especially compared to even the most basic resorts in other Caribbean countries, which tend to offer more  thoughtfully designed spaces. You could argue the Cove is different, but locking yourself in the Cove area the whole time seems unrealistic/there's better resorts than Cove if that's your plan.

Expanding on Cove and perception... Atlantis gives you the facade of luxury: high-end boutiques you’d see at somewhere like the Wynn are steps away from $200/night Coral rooms where blue haired people are milling about. Mega yachts sit parked in front of the cheapest food options on property. The mix of these elements creates a disjointed vibe that feels like an intentional spectacle, making the rich a spectacle for the poors & vice versa.

We had a decent time and don’t regret going, but we probably wouldn’t rush back. Would love to hear others’ thoughts—am I the odd one out? I just cant totally put my finger on why it feels like Atlantis was mediocre when on paper everything was good and cost was almost $0 all in. ",5,1737564921.0,bahamas,4,1.0,False

I had to go the bathroom after 2.5 hrs and then I wrapped it up and we went home.

Aren’t I worth at least telling “hey this isn’t working?” I’d understand, I was really having some doubts because she was little rude to me at times. Cutting me off, dismissing my interests, and talking down on my education basically. But I’d hang out again and maybe it will smooth out.

A UX designer with too much coffee and a wild imagination. 💡 Presenting my concept for the JioStar, a seamless streaming universe that doesn't just *strea*m, but *dream*s. ✨

**Key Ideas:**

1️⃣ **Two Platforms**

Disney+ Hotstar has been rebranded to simply, ""Hotstar"" & now caters to the metropolitan binge-watchers (usual HBO-watching, coffee-sipping crowd).

Vistar (the rebranded, JioCinema) serves the pan-India content connoisseurs, local flavors, grassroots vibes, and nostalgia-packed storytelling.

[That's one way to divide Hostar & JioCinema's content](https://preview.redd.it/nlbefd7crkee1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df92e34680e2a8bd150cd59a7e01e5c6f3f552e0)



2️⃣ **Hotstar Upgrades**

An AI-powered GPT-style search that’s smarter than your cousin who “knows movies.” Just type, ""That movie where SRK says 'Don’t underestimate the power of a common man',"" and boom, it’s there.

Watch Party: Stream with friends AND celebrities. Ever wanted to hear your favorite actor roast their own dialogue live? Now you can.

[There you go, Hotstar's new home screen.](https://preview.redd.it/i7mazznjrkee1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e19b22c274126f9268f938bc3d5f7ae8ea19614)

3️⃣ **Vistar (JioCinema's Rebranding)**

Think of it as JioCinema’s glow-up. Homegrown content in an interface inspired by the best of both worlds. Basically, a UI so intuitive, it practically reads your mind.

So...does this make me the future UX head of JioStar? Or just someone with too much free time? You decide. 😜

Sebastián sat at his desk in Casa Montalvo, reviewing a dossier from Director Elena Morales. It was thick with reports of unrest, political maneuvering, and economic sabotage.

Antonia Reyes entered quietly, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. “The reports from the port just arrived,” she said, setting the cup down.

Sebastián nodded, though his attention was fixed on the dossier. “What’s the mood in New San Juan?”

“Cautious,” Antonia replied. “The workers are nervous, but the Port Authority is holding things steady. Director Morales sent word that another attempt at sabotage was intercepted last night.”

Sebastián closed the dossier with a sigh, leaning back in his chair. “The opposition is relentless. They think Barrera’s austerity measures weaken us, but it only makes our enemies bolder.”

A Meeting with Javier Ortega

General Javier Ortega arrived shortly after, his boots clicking against the marble floors of the study. He removed his hat respectfully as Antonia showed him in.

“General,” Sebastián greeted him. “What news from Cuba?”

Ortega sat across from him, his expression grim. “China's business presence is growing. They’ve secured contracts with key factions in Havana, promising development aid in exchange for influence.”

“And the Iron Spine?” Sebastián asked.

“Still operational, but barely,” Ortega admitted. “We’ve managed to keep their hands off the railway itself, but they’re pressing hard.”

Sebastián steepled his fingers, deep in thought. “We need to make the Cubans realize that a stronger Puerto Rico means a stronger Caribbean. Offer them guarantees—security, trade benefits. And if that fails, remind them of the reversion clause.”

Ortega raised a brow. “And if they state they've operated for years without a strong Puerto Rico?”

“Then I will invoke the reversion clause. If I must,” Sebastián said firmly. “But I’d prefer cooperation to conflict.”

---

The Santiago Family Returns

Later in the day, Judge Elena Santiago and her daughter Camila arrived at Casa Montalvo. They carried documents detailing the latest legal challenges against Barrera’s policies.

“Governor Barrera’s administration is exploiting every loophole it can find,” Elena began. “They’ve even tried to cut funding for the judiciary entirely.”

Sebastián glanced at the stack of papers. “And the courts?”

“Overwhelmed but holding,” Elena said. “For now. But without intervention, it’s only a matter of time before the backlog cripples us.”

Camila spoke up hesitantly. “There’s another issue, Governor. The cases tied to foreign influence—specifically Chinese and French interests—are being delayed intentionally. Someone’s protecting them.”

Sebastián’s jaw tightened. “Who?”

“We don’t have names yet,” Elena admitted. “But the trail leads back to Barrera’s inner circle.”

---

A Private Exchange with Isabella Vélez-Campo

As dusk fell, Sebastián found Isabella Vélez-Campo in the library, poring over a legal text. She looked up as he entered, her expression sharp and focused.

“You’ve heard about the judiciary’s struggles?” Sebastián asked, taking a seat across from her.

Isabella nodded. “It’s deliberate. Barrera’s administration is trying to undermine the courts to consolidate power. If we don’t act soon, they’ll succeed.”

“What’s your recommendation?” Sebastián asked.

“Use the House of Lords,” Isabella said. “They have the authority to intervene in cases of governmental overreach. It’s a drastic step, but it may be the only way to protect the judiciary.”

Sebastián considered her words carefully. “And what about the influences of the China and France?”

Isabella’s gaze hardened. “We’ll need more than legal measures for that. I’ll start assembling a team to trace the money and expose their networks.”

---

A Reflection on Power

That night, Sebastián sat alone on the balcony of Casa Montalvo, the city lights twinkling in the distance. He held a letter from Austria, its seal unbroken. It had been sent by Claudia Herrera, their ambassador in Vienna, but Sebastián hesitated to open it.

Antonia Reyes appeared beside him, her presence as calming as ever. “You’ve been quiet all evening,” she said.

Sebastián sighed. “Sometimes I wonder if I’ve done more harm than good. The alliances, the deals—they’re all fragile. And now Barrera is unraveling everything we built.”

Antonia placed a hand on his shoulder. “You’ve always known the risks, Sebastián. But you also knew the rewards. Puerto Rico is stronger because of you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now.”

Sebastián gave her a faint smile. “Let’s hope you’re right, Antonia. The future depends on it.”",1,1737564685.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

As someone that was a huge LOST fan years ago, I could not help but see parallels between Lumon Industries and the Dharma Initiative.","Hi all,

First post in this sub, and I can't believe it took me this long to finally watch this incredible show.  While I still am processing what exactly happened during the 1st season, one aspect of the show I kept finding fascinating was how much Lumon reminded me of the Dharma Initiative in LOST.  Although I still do not fully understand the motives of Lumon, here are some the paralles I noticed between Lumon and Dharma:

* Both have mysterious origins that are never fully fleshed out - at least initially - during the show
* Both companies seem to make virtually everything on their own.  Lumon coffee makers, raisin pouches, pens etc.  The Dharma Initiative was the same with all of the many supplies on The Island.  
* Although I am not certain what the exact time period of Severance is, both Lumon and Dharma seem like companies that have more of a 60s-70s-80s vibe to them than a more 'modern' feel to them.  From their technology to their fashion and style...it all feels decades old. 
* This is a little redundant from the previous bullet point, but the Lumon videos on VHS-C tapes had the same feeling as all of the Dharma orientation videos that were either on VHS or 8-track videos.  

I'm new here so I apologize if this has been brought up before, and I'm not sure if this was done intentionally by the writers or not, but I have to think that anyone that has watched and loved both shows sees the connections, right?",7,1737564614.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,2,0.9,False

I asked her out to coffee recently. She said yes! Over a couple days we texted some and set up plans. The night before we were supposed to meet up she texted asking if we could reschedule. The next morning I told her it was no problem and asked her when she would like to reschedule to.

I’ve gathered that she isn’t interested in me, but I wish I could hear that definitively from her. My friends who I’ve told the full context to have said I need to be patient and she’s interested but probably busy, etc. Some have said she doesn’t like you move on. Idk what to believe

### History
2024 was a big mess of a running year for me. It started out promising: I had just turned 40 and was signed up for my first Boston Marathon having qualified at Baltimore (2:52:38) in 2022 and then having run a PR (2:41:25) in New York in 2023. 

In January I rolled my ankle on a run and, while it didn’t stop my training, it was swollen and probably needed more rest than I gave it. A couple of weeks later during a trail run I sprained the same ankle badly to the point where I couldn’t put any weight on it for weeks. I tried hard to rehab and return to running but, in the end, had to pull out of Boston and didn’t really return to running until mid-May. It was rough going at first and so in an effort to motivate myself and try something different I signed up for the Pike’s Peak Marathon and threw myself into hill training. I built up a lot of fitness leading into that race in September but then the race itself was cut short by a snowstorm rolling in the morning of the race. Incredibly frustrated that my marathon plans were again thwarted I looked around, and in October, landed on the Houston Marathon as my redemption race.

### Training
I had fifteen weeks to prepare for Houston. I was at a baseline of 30 miles per week (5 runs per week) recovering from Pike’s Peak so I built out a plan that would slowly build that to 60 miles per week (Running every day). I did Sunday long runs, but the longest was only ever 16 miles, and built in some 5k races for speedwork but otherwise I would just get out every morning and run at a comfortable pace for that day (anywhere 6:45 – 8:30/Mile) for 5-10 miles.

Despite all the running, over the holidays I put on about 5lbs, so from Christmas until a few days before the race I really concentrated on my diet (restricting processed foods and sugar, and totally cutting out alcohol) and managed to lose the extra weight plus a couple of extra pounds.

### Pre-race
I flew into Houston alone on Saturday morning, checked straight into the Moxy Downtown (great location and price, but minimal amenities) and then did a shakeout jog to the convention center. Really well-organized race and I was able to pick up my bib quickly. The expo was a bit chaotic and so, after unsuccessfully trying to find some warmer clothes to race in at Tracksmith, I left pretty quickly to get some Birria tacos with lots of rice and beans.

I spent the rest of the day laying in bed watching football before having a veggie heavy pizza at Tiny Champions (highly recommend) for dinner and then back to the hotel room for more football, lots of water and candy for dessert. 

Unsurprisingly I didn’t sleep particularly well, so I was up at 4am to shower, eat a peanut butter sandwich and a banana, and wash it down with a black coffee and a Maurten 320 drink. I ran my post race warm clothes over to bag drop and felt pretty happy with my choice of shorts, t-shirt, arm warmers, gloves and beanie for the race.

### Race
I timed my walk to the corral pretty well so that I wasn’t standing in the cold for too long and for most of the time the crowd was so dense that it blocked any wind anyway. After waiting out the wheelchair and half-marathon elite starts we were walked over to the start line just behind the elite marathoners. In a very short time (mostly spent dodging the barrage of throwaway warm up jackets) we were off.

The first mile was really difficult to get a rhythm going. There were so many people and I caught and accidently gave a few elbows. I tried hard not to expend more energy or cover more distance than needed and by 1.5 miles it had sorted itself out in a way that allowed me to catch my pace. I was aiming 6:00/Mile for as long as I could hold it.

I was carrying six gels with me at the start (four in my belt and one in each of my arm warmer pockets) and it was about here where I felt one arm warmer gel slip out and fly away into the crowd behind me. I checked my other arm warmer and realized that that gel was already gone too. The four in my belt were secure so I mentally recalculated when to take them, committed to taking Gatorade instead of water at the stations, and pressed on.
During Miles 3 through 7 I was aware that I was going faster than planned but it felt very easy and I decided that this was probably the influence of the wind, and I should just ride it while I can, knowing that I’ll be running into it later in the race.

After Mile 7 I started to feel like my bladder was full. I had felt this before in races and knew that it often would pass so I pushed on but it became harder to ignore with each passing mile. In my mind I was telling myself that I wanted to stay where I was because I was just behind some elite women running together and I wanted to be part of a group for the miles after half way as we headed north into the wind. Half way is also the site of the only real hill in the entire race and at that point the group splintered and I ended up out in front. I pushed on for another couple of miles but it was clear I was on my own now. I made the decision to stop, pee, and then hopefully get back on course in time to join some of the folks coming up behind me. I spotted some port-a-cans and stepped off, I started peeing… and peeing… and peeing. Honestly I think I was going for more 30 seconds straight, I was shocked. When I exited all of my earlier group was in front of me but I felt so, so much lighter. 

I slowly started to reel them back in. I reached for my third Maurten gel of the race. As soon as I sucked it down I involuntarily gagged and spat the entire thing in one gelatinous blob back into the air. Without thinking about it I reflexively reached out and caught it in front of me with a wool gloved hand. For the next several steps I stared at it. If I hadn’t lost the gels at the start I would have thrown this now hairy gooey mess away but I knew I needed it, I slurped it down, simultaneously proud and disgusted with myself.

I now got back into a very comfortable rhythm and hit 5:48/mile for my next six miles. At mile 23 I did a calculation as we hit the rollers on Allen Parkway and knew that I had all my goals in the bag if nothing disastrous happened. My calves and hamstrings were starting to feel tight, and I knew there was potential for cramps, so I backed off ever so slightly to 6:00/Mile pace. When I hit downtown and knew that I would make it, I accelerated again and it coincided with a wind tunnel at my back. I flew home for the last mile with a giant smile on my face, pumping my fists as I crossed the line.

### Post-race
Immediately after the race I was elated. I couldn’t stop smiling. I knew if I stopped moving for too long I would cramp so I kept moving along to collect all my medal, t-shirt, drop-bag etc.. My stomach wasn’t feeling great so I skipped the food. After resting at the hotel for an hour or so, I joined the Tracksmith crew at Frost Town Brewing for (in my dehydrated state) too many celebratory beers. Met some great people there but had to call it after a couple of hours for some much needed lunch, water and a nap. 

Over the last few days I’ve recovered incredibly well and I’m excited about the potential for things like a Chicago ADP spot, or (even if some folks think its just a money grab) the AG World Championships in 2026. Next up though I have another shot at Boston!

In the cracks of the pavement, the city grows old.

  
The saxophone wails, a cry in the night,  
Bassline shadows keep the rhythm tight.  
A coffee cup steams in a poet’s hands,  
Writing verses in time’s shifting sands.

  
Lost in the haze of neon dreams,  
Where the truth gets blurred in moonlit streams.  
Windows reflect what the heart can’t hide,  
The jazzman’s sorrow, the rapper’s pride.  
Looping beats, like a clock on rewind,

  
Searching the alleys for peace of mind.  
The groove’s alive, it pulls me in,  
A battle of chaos, where soul begins.  
So I spit these lines, let the rhythm collide,  
Jazz and rap, two worlds that glide.

  
Through the city's veins, where the echoes play,  
This is the anthem of night turned day.  
From the subway roar to the rooftop blues,  
Every sound in this city leaves a clue.  
A siren cries, it paints the air red,

  
While the rhythm of life keeps pounding ahead.  
There’s a drummer in the shadows, hands on steel,  
Tapping out truths only the night can reveal.  
A cypher forms under flickering lights,  
With rhymes that cut sharper than city fights.

  
On the edge of dawn, the skyline yawns,  
A silent witness to nights that are gone.  
But the groove don’t sleep, it carries the day,  
Through whispers of dreams that never decay.

  
Graffiti walls scream with colors ablaze,  
Stories of hope in the city’s maze.  
The past, the future, it’s all in the beat,  
A timeless connection beneath my feet.

  
The jazzman nods as the rapper flows,  
Two rhythms united, wherever it goes.  
This is the hymn of a world combined,  
A melody carved in the depths of time.

1i7faad,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i7faad/help_needed_ideal_espresso_setup_2000/,Help Needed: Ideal Espresso Setup [$2000],"Hi everyone,

I’ve been doing a ton of “couch research” on espresso machines and setups (thank you, Lance Hendrick, James Hoffman, and other content creators on this subject), and I’d love to get some advice from [r/espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/)

A bit about us:

* My hobbies include building computers and woodworking, so I’m fine with a machine that requires a bit of work or tinkering.
* My wife would also use the setup, and while she’s open to a little training, she’d prefer something that’s more intuitive and user-friendly.
* We’re regular coffee drinkers and enjoy pour-overs at least twice a day. Visiting cafes is a favorite hobby of ours.

We rarely spend money on ourselves, so we’re okay splurging a bit—especially if it means getting a high-quality machine with convenient features and great aesthetics. Here’s the progression of machines I’ve been considering:

1. **Gaggia Classic Pro** (with the upgrade path to the Gaggiuno mod).
2. **Profitec Go** (to avoid Gaggia temp surfing/tinkering, and overall better build quality).
3. **Rancilio Silvia Pro X and Profitec Move** (dual boilers, advanced temperature control, pre-infusion, and enhanced user interfaces)

Right now, I’m leaning toward the Profitec Move, primarily because of its 3-year warranty and the fact that it’s a newer machine, which feels like a safer bet for future-proofing. However, I’m hesitant because the \~$2000 budget opens up so many other options, and I’m feeling a little overwhelmed trying to sort through them all.

For the grinder, I’m planning to go with the MiiCoffee DF64 II Single Dosing Coffee Grinder to complement the setup.

Bonus points if the setup can replicate a retail workflow, as we dream of opening an espresso cafe someday.

Any advice on narrowing this down or other recommendations that might fit our \~$2000 budget?

If the previous model, the Giga 6 has this feature, wouldn't the Giga 10 have it as well?

I am having to bounce around the menu every time we have coffee as my wife likes one drink with extra milk foam and I like a different one, with extra milk foam.

It would be so much simpler if the three options, her coffee, my coffee and the milk foam were all on the main first screen it displays.

Is there a hidden menu option to enable this learning mode? I looked but the menu is really very basic, language preference, water scale settings, set the wifi and a few others but no mention of a smart learning mode.

But some days I'm sad. Not because I want him back, but because I want real love that doesn't abandon you. Real love that's here for good and doesn't lie, manipulate, and diminish you. And sometimes I feel like I won't ever find that. Because I did believe that he was the one at one point. 

And sometimes all you want is to finally find that person that will hold you and love you unconditionally... but while you wait, maybe you can think about all the reasons to be grateful to be single for now.

Because...

\- At least you're not crying, begging someone to treat you with the respect you deserve

\- At least you're not destroying your mental health sacrificing things for somebody who never had the intention of doing the same for you 

\- You may not have anybody to cuddle at night, but at least you're not laying awake, sleepless, because you don't recognize the person laying next to you anymore 

\- You may not have anybody to enjoy a walk or a coffee date with, but at least you're not arguing over trivial things like who will get the bill this time or what you meant by what you said

\- At least you're not preoccupied with anxiety because they did something they promised they wouldn't do again

\- At least you're no longer becoming a shell of who you were because you wanted to appease them and lost yourself in the process

\- At least you're not on medication anymore because they treated you so poorly that the only way to get through the day was to dose yourself with chemical happiness 

\- At least you don't have to wonder if he's falling out of love with you slowly anymore

\- At least you no longer have to feel horrible about yourself because he is no longer showing you the same kind of love he showed you in the beginning and you're blaming yourself for his change in behaviour 

\- At least you're finally free to do, think, feel, say, be what you want

You're finally free baby girl and take a moment to breathe in that freedom. Because even though you don't have somebody by your side, that new inner peace and internal happiness you now have due to his absence is worth having to feel alone sometimes. At least for a little while longer until you find your forever person. And you will. And you'll know the right person would never make you feel any of these feelings again.

1i7f1la,https://www.reddit.com/r/Incontinence/comments/1i7f1la/urge_incontinence/,Urge incontinence?,"(25M) a little background: I grew up wetting the bed until I was a teenager. It haunted me as I was never able to go to sleepovers and when I started to feel more comfortable around 14/15 I still wore pull up’s for protection. The doctor said it was from an overactive bladder and ADHD could play a role in the issue. Fast forward a few years, I stopped wetting the bed regularly and only had an accident if I would drink a lot of beer in college. Like once or twice a year. 

In the past few years I have noticed that I have to pee very frequently and when I have to go, I have to go. Sometimes I’m able to hold it but then there are quite a few times where I have a few minutes to find a bathroom or you know what. It’s started to get worse the last year or so to the point where my friends are like noticing how frequently I have to pee. Additionally I’ve noticed that coffee and alcohol make it almost uncontrollable. Like if I drink my coffee in the morning I’ll have to pee every 30 minutes, all day long (I try to drink 5 L of water while at work). It’s gotten to a point where I’m self conscious walking to the bathroom so frequently as I have to walk past my secretary and I’m sure she’s like what’s up with this guy lol. I know coffee and alcohol are diuretics so it doesn’t help my cause at all but I feel like it shouldn’t be as uncontrollable as it has been. 

I’ve never told anyone this but just a month ago I went to a football game, only had 3 beers, and on the way home I had to pee. It was only a 15 minute drive but by the time I got dropped off at my front door I couldn’t hold it anymore and ended up peeing my pants on accident and it was terribly embarrassing. Is this urge incontinence? Is this something I should ask my doctor about? I don’t feel confident going somewhere where I’m without a bathroom for a long period of time now and honestly, I feel more comfortable if I were to wear a pull up or adult style diaper for preventative measures.

Anyway i recently remembered that one of the hundreds of things my parents tried when i was a kid was a diet where i only ate things like Rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, broth, veggies. And no sugar of any kind, not even fruit, no wheat, bread, pasta, no spice. no fermented products, no tea, no coffee, no cheese, no milk products except probiotics like Kefir.

Back then my eczema got much better on this diet, and i lost a lot of weight in a good way (even for a kid i was overweight from inflammation). So i am trying it now this week.

I have started on monday and cold turkey cut out all wheat/bread, sugar, nuts (peanut butter etc), milk products (except kefir), and most importantly tea and coffee. just to see if it will work again after a few weeks or a month. While i am intaking carbs still, the amount is much lower than before.

in recent times my diet has been ""healthy"" im not eating bags of chips and ice cream everyday and drinking soda, but i also kind of eat everything, the only thing that keeps me fit is daily exercise and i know how to moderate and ""stop myself"" when eating. But i have been drinking a cup of coffee every day sometimes 1.5 cups.

It's been 3 days since i started and i am much more tired than usual and i'm wondering, is it the food change that's making me tired? or my nervous system withdrawing from caffeine everyday?

Hi DOTers! I'm a long time reader and poster on this sub, it's helped me through some truly disastrous dating situations. Earlier this year, I posted a thread about ""the oversharing phenomenon"" and had a lot of interesting discussion. There was one comment from a guy who lived near me that caught my eye, and by some magical serendipity that neither of us quite understand, he decided to message me later that evening. After some friendly back and forth, he invited me out on a coffee date. I had deleted my apps (for good!) a few months prior, so I figured there was no harm in meeting this random guy from reddit.

There was definitely a mutual attraction when we met, but I was still feeling pretty cautious about dating, having been burned pretty badly by a guy over Christmas. So we started going on dates (that he thoughtfully planned <3) and getting to know each other slowly. After about a month we went on a camping trip together and I think that's where we both really fell for each other. He was transparent about his interest in me the whole time and I had to work on believing that a guy like him actually existed (going on over 200 dates will really do something to your psyche, I tell you).

Since then we've traveled internationally together, gone to burning man, and are co-parenting a dog I recently adopted. We joke about whether we're still in the honeymoon phase or not because we've had our share of bickering, but we're so happy. It's by FAR the healthiest relationship I've ever been in! I'd gotten to the point of being pretty pessimistic about dating after being single 6 years, so I'm incredibly grateful that there actually was a man out there for me who was everything I wanted and more.

Oh and I'm 33F and he's 29, so he would have not even made it in my dating app age filters. Just goes to show, you \*never\* know how you'll meet someone. When I was single I really loved hearing stories like these, so just wanted to share some hope and happiness with y'all :)

TL;DR: met an amazing guy on this sub and now we are in LOVE!

1i7evqt,https://i.redd.it/x0tyoeq8mkee1.jpeg,My morning routine,"Good morning 💜
Everybody has their own way of doing things I want to share my own routine with you all.  I am very simple on the morning. Have 3 kids to get up and out the door by 7:30 am so most of my routine is after I get them going. 
I wake up wash my face and get the circulation going by tapping ( sometimes slapping 🤣) my face for 2 minutes. Take my morning vitamins probiotics and slippery elm. Have a minimum of 20 g protein and then my cherished coffee. If I have time I jump on my rebounder for 5 minutes get my lymphatic system going. Then I do my morning 10 or more min of face yoga and massage. Picture attached is my favorite little lady who watches me do this everyday 💜💜

I have traveled solo before, but struggle with filling out entire days because typically, the things I want to do don’t take as much time as I thought they would. I like museums and sites and all that jazz, but also don’t enjoy doing too many paid experiences because broke.

So I guess the question is, how do you fill your time and travel a bit slower? What are activities that you like to do when there is a bit more down time when traveling (I.e. reading, knitting, people watching?) 

In the past I’ve tried the go to a coffee shop with a notepad to doodle or journal or just chill, but then feel bored easily/guilty taking up a table too long..",2,1737562640.0,femaletravels,1,1.0,False

Say you're (a F2) offering to buy coffee for doctors in an office.
As a consultant, would you be happy or uncomfortable to accept the offer?

Another way of rephrasing this: Would a consultant be okay with juniors buying them coffee (in the context of buying it for a couple of other docs as well as a 'coffee round')

I recently stayed for one night at the Park Hyatt Kyoto. I booked this for 45K/night, and was able to apply a SUA a few months later, confirming me into the Park Suite.


I arrived around noon, and was warmly greeted by the staff. They immediately grabbed my luggage from the taxi and escorted me into the lobby. Check-in started with a welcome drink of choice (champagne for me) and a quick confirmation of my reservations for the  Kohaku Bar, as well as the Japanese Breakfast the following morning. I was told my room would be ready at the official 3pm check-in time.


At 3pm I returned and was escorted to my suite on the 3rd floor, and was given a tour of the room & it's features.


The living room has a couch two chairs, as well as a minibar and TV, with your private garden in the backdrop. On the table was a welcome amenity of some delicious strawberries and a welcome note. 


The bedroom had a comfy king bed, large TV, coffee table, and chair with an ottoman. 


Entering the bathroom was a beautifully designed vanity with dual sinks. Off to the right is the large shower area complete with a rainfall head & soaking tub. 


On the left is the spacious walk-in closet. There was plentyt of room to store all your clothing and multiple suitcases. At the very back is a mirror, which doubles as the door to the toilet. The opposite wall of the toilet area is the door that leads to the foyer.


I had a reservation at the Kohaku Bar at 4pm to catch the sunset while having a cocktail, or two. The bar offers some really great views alongside an expansive cocktail & whiskey menu. 
I conveniently left at 5pm to head down to ""The Living Room"" in the main lobby area for the complimentary champagne hour for Globalist. They served a Thienot Brut champagne which appears to retail for ~$50. They were quite generous with the pours and came frequently to top off. I was also presented with a cold towel and snacks.


I visited the Spa and bathhouse area, which was pretty solid. Theres a hot & cold bath, sauna, steam room and this machine that had cold ice to cool you down. The bathhouse area is overall on the smaller side, but was only busy on one of my visits.


For breakfast, I had the Japanese Breakfast. Yes there is a charge for it which is annoying, but I had to try it. I thought it was ok overall. Not mad I tried it, but don't need to do it again. 

Overall I had a fun & excellent stay at the PH, & can see why many people love this property.

1i7erjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectingDFW/comments/1i7erjw/jacobs_courtroom_calling/,Jacob's Courtroom Calling,"For years, Jacob Ortega lived in a constant state of exhaustion. By day, he worked long hours at a downtown Dallas coffee shop, pouring lattes and clearing tables. By night, he pored over case law and legal textbooks, every page a step closer to his dream. Jacob wasn’t just in law school—he was living it, breathing it, sacrificing for it.

When he could scrape together a spare hour, Jacob would slip into the back of the courtroom at the George Allen courthouse. He wasn’t there for any particular case—just to listen, to learn, to watch seasoned attorneys navigate the complexities of the law with precision and passion. It was his way of bridging the gap between what the books taught him and what he knew the real world demanded.

But the reality of his circumstances often felt like a weight he couldn’t shake. Rent was always due, his car was a sputtering mess that barely got him from home to school to work, and there were nights he’d skip dinner just to save a few dollars. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d gone out with friends or had a moment to himself that wasn’t tied to work or study.

And then, there was the looming specter of the bar exam—a mountain he wasn’t sure he could climb.

The months leading up to the exam were grueling. Jacob practically lived in the law library, surrounded by flashcards, outlines, and highlighters that were running dry from overuse. Sleep became a luxury he couldn’t afford, and every doubt he’d buried deep within himself seemed to rise to the surface.

“What if I fail?” he thought more times than he could count.

But Jacob didn’t fail.

The moment he saw the word “PASS” next to his name on the Texas Bar Exam results website, he fell to his knees. Years of struggle, sacrifice, and relentless determination had paid off.

The offers didn’t come immediately, but when they did, they came all at once. Jacob found himself sitting in a conference room at one firm, then another, and then another—each one impressed by his story, his perseverance, and his undeniable hunger to make a difference. Three firms, all vying for him as their newest associate.

For so long, Jacob had worried that the light at the end of the tunnel was just a mirage. But now, he could feel it warming his skin.

He ultimately chose a reputable [accident and injury firm in Dallas](https://loncarlyonjenkins.com/), one that prided itself on fighting for justice for those who couldn’t fight for themselves. On his first day, he stepped into the office—a sleek space with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Dallas skyline—and felt an overwhelming sense of pride.

He wasn’t just a barista. He wasn’t just a student scraping by. He was a lawyer.

Jacob hit the ground running. Within months, he was arguing motions in court, meeting with clients who looked at him with hope in their eyes, and building a reputation as a fierce advocate. His life transformed seemingly overnight. Gone were the days of worrying about whether he could pay his rent or keep his car running. He wasn’t just surviving anymore—he was thriving.

But more than the material changes, Jacob felt something deeper—a sense of purpose. He wasn’t just practicing law. He was making a difference.

And every time he passed the George Allen courthouse, he couldn’t help but smile, remembering the countless hours he’d spent sitting in the back row, dreaming of the day he’d stand at the front.",1,1737562498.0,ConnectingDFW,0,1.0,False
